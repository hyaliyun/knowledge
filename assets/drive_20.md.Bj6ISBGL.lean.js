A controversial project to build a hydroelectric dam and reservoir on the Delaware River in the 1950s and 1960s led to government's seizure of land in northwestern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The construction of the dam would have created a lake reservoir that would have flooded the Walpack Valley. For political and geological reasons, the dam project was deauthorized and the land transferred to the management of the National Park Service for the establishment of a National Recreation Area.Feiveson, Harold; Sinden, Frank; and Socolow, Robert.

History  Bamboo forest near Shizhuo, Chiayi County Taiwan is situated between the temperate zone and the subtropical zone. Such a climate propels the growth of both individual disperse temperate bamboo and connected subtropical bamboo jungles. As a result, the native Taiwanese have a close relationship with the bamboos here: bamboo shoots, which are what they eat, come out of bamboos; so does the bamboo hat, bamboo shoes, bamboo chair, bamboo house, etc., all of which are closely connected with their livelihood; as for the tools used in daily labor, most of them are bamboo products, such as fishing gears, farm tools, hunting instrument, and so on. During the period when Taiwan was invaded, the bamboo culture in Taiwan was deepened by the Japanese bamboo culture. So a unique and profound bamboo culture was formed in Taiwan, and the knitting skills were improved to a certain extent. Therefore, Taiwan has become famous for its bamboo weaving crafts all over the world out of its wholesome tradition and profound local features.Dong 2009 About a century ago, the bambooworking was only limited to the making of living materials and productive tools such as hats, buckets, food steamers, dustpans, tables and chairs, beds, ridges and so on; when Taiwan was invaded by the Japanese at the end of the 19th century, the bamboo weaving skills were widely extended from the living and production use to the field of stationery, decoration, and even arts. In the meanwhile, the rough weaving skills were refined to be more delicate. The stationery case and lamp cover, which was woven by the Japanese artist at the Guangxu Times in Qing dynasty in China, was first discovered by Wang Zhenduo.Chu 2009 Both these two bamboo products are beautiful in color, discreet in skills, and fashionable in pattern, which makes it too attractive to be released from one‚Äôs hands. The stationery case is 30 centimeters in length, 18 centimeters in width, and 8 centimeters in height. Woven by a number of bamboo strips of 0.5 cm in width, the stationery case has such average gaps between every two strips that it seems as if it were produced by the assembly line in the factory rather than made by human hands. Besides, the purplish red bamboo strips, where letter paper and thread- bound books were placed, appear quite simple and historically meaningful. As for the lamp cover, it is 23 centimeters in length, and 5 centimeters in width. Seeing the brown bamboo filament on the lamp and the paper-cut window decoration, one must be reminiscent of a simply-dressed and elegant host of the room.Huang 2009 Application  The flower-like baskets in Taiwan is the most locally characteristic. Some are in the shape of jar with two ear-like handles; some are in the shape of bamboo barrel; some are in the shape of pack basket; others are in the shape of glass, bottle, pot, pan, bucket and so on. As for the weaving skill, it is divided into plain weave, vertical weave, slant weaves, and revolving weaves. The frame starting is divided into two types: inner starting and outer starting. There are both regulatory pattern design and casual design varying from the artist‚Äôs personal preference.Cultural China 2012 The pack basket ones must be mentioned here, because they are so uniquely characteristic in shape design. The artist tends to base on the common pack basket and start weaving from the outer side. Therefore, the whole basket is sturdy in structure and rich in poetic meaning out of its special shape; the artists also make some innovation on the decorative patterns of the jar-like basket with two ear-like handles: they make the most of the materials and decorate the basket with slim bamboo branches, which make the basket more elegant and classic. Then the most delicate must be the two bamboo gadgets, one being the earthworm cage and the other being grasshopper cage. In the past, we used to see the fishermen were caught to be fishing in the drawings from Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty in China. In the pictures, one would usually find a little bamboo cage around the fisherman‚Äôs waist. Though frequently thought to be the fish cage, it is actually carried to put the earthworms in; the earthworm cage has contracture strips and is equipped with wood plug; as a result, when the earthworm moves inside the cage, it cannot escape through the little holes though it can breathe freely. As for the grasshopper cage, it is designed to be gourd- shaped, which can be placed upon the breaking branches of ancient trees. It is suitable for the grasshoppers in summer and crickets in autumn.Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology 2007  See also  * Chinese bamboo weaving * Japanese bamboo weaving * Wanchojang in Korea  References   Further reading  *Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology. 2007. \\"Traditional Bamboo Rattan-Woven Objects and Crafts.\\" http://www.awbw.tw/tw/?Page=aboutx&item;=14 (accessed 3 31, 2013). *Chu, Shang. \\"Master Bamboo Woven crafts.\\" 2009. http://village.nthg.gov.tw/chushang/beauty/beauty_01.htm (accessed 4 5, 2013). *Cultural China. \\"The Marvels of Bamboo Basketry.\\" Cultural China. 2012. http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/143Arts13223.html (accessed 4 7, 2013). *Dong, Lin. \\"Traditional Bamboo Woven Crafts.\\" 2009. http://www.awbw.tw/tw/?Page=aboutx&item;=14 (accessed 4 1, 2013). *Huang, Tu Shan. \\"Bamboo Woven Crafts.\\" 2009. http://www.aerc.nhcue.edu.tw/4-0/newteach/ (accessed 3 31, 2013).

The music director since 2017 has been Cristian MƒÉcelaru. According to Jesse Rosen, CEO of the League of American Orchestras, the Festival is \\"distinctive for being focused entirely on contemporary works.\\" Each year, a tenured orchestra gathers in Santa Cruz, California to rehearse five programs of contemporary music, often world, US, or West Coast premieres. Most of the composers whose work is performed each season come to the Festival to be in residence and participate in the rehearsals and performances of their work, as well as to participate in public panel discussions, lectures, and concert introductions. The Festival also presents guest artists and ensembles known for contemporary music performance, such as Kronos Quartet or eighth blackbird. History The Festival was founded in 1963 by the composer Lou Harrison and collaborators from the Santa Cruz-area music community, on the campus of the newly opened Cabrillo College just outside Santa Cruz in Aptos, California. The first music director was Gerhard Samuel. The Festival quickly grew to prominence, thanks in part to Harrison's stature and the participation of well-known composers such as John Cage and Aaron Copland. Subsequent music directors included Mexican composer Carlos Ch√°vez, conductor Dennis Russell Davies, and American composer John Adams. By the late 1970s, the Festival had established itself as an independent organization unaffiliated with Cabrillo College. After the devastating Loma Prieta earthquake caused major damage around Santa Cruz in 1989, the Festival established itself in downtown Santa Cruz, and the majority of the Festival's performances since 1989 have taken place at Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium or at Mission San Juan Bautista in San Juan Bautista, California. In 1992, Marin Alsop was chosen as the Festival's new music director. Alsop rose to significant fame in the 2000s after being the first conductor awarded a MacArthur Genius Grant in 2005 and the first woman named to direct a major American orchestra, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, in 2007. In 1992, she was a young up-and-coming musician. She decided to more exclusively focus the Festival on the work of living composers. Since her tenure began, the Festival has promoted the careers of a number of prominent composers, performing their work and offering substantial commissions. Notable examples include Christopher Rouse, Jennifer Higdon, Kevin Puts, and Michael Daugherty. The Festival also frequently features the music of Philip Glass, John Adams, James MacMillan, and Osvaldo Golijov, among others. In September 2016, the Festival announced that Cristian MƒÉcelaru would succeed Alsop as Music Director, beginning in summer 2017. The Cabrillo Festival Orchestra consists of professional musicians from around the world who travel to Santa Cruz annually for the two-week run of the festival. There is no formal audition process for the orchestra; new players are recruited by the Music Director in consultation with principal players, and undergo a three-season trial process before being granted tenure in their positions. The current Concertmaster of the Festival Orchestra is Justin Bruns, Associate Concertmaster of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Other current principal players include Tim Munro (flute); Karen Wagner (oboe); Bharat Chandra (clarinet); Evan Kuhlmann (bassoon); Craig Morris (trumpet); Ava Ordman (trombone); Forrest Byram (tuba); Galen Lemmon (percussion); Nuiko Wadden (harp); Emily Wong (keyboard); Matt Albert (2nd violin); Sam Bergman (viola); Abraham Feder (cello); and Edward Botsford (bass). Activities In 2012, the Festival celebrated its 50th anniversary with a series of commissioned world premieres by such composers as Laura Karpman and James MacMillan. This followed celebrations of Marin Alsop's 20th anniversary as music director in 2011, which also included a number of substantial commissions by John Corigliano, Mark Adamo, Philip Glass, and others. The Festival has a commissioning series for young composers identified in collaboration with John Adams that has included new works by Zosha Di Castri, Dylan Mattingly, and Sean Friar. The Festival also runs a \\"Conductors/Composers Workshop\\" in collaboration with the Conductors Guild in which young conductors study with Marin Alsop while emerging composers study with a faculty member chosen from among the season's composers-in-residence. Alumni of this program include Aleksandra Vrebalov and Missy Mazzoli. The Festival also produces a large street fair, the \\",\\" held over two days during the first weekend of August. The Fair spotlights performances and art work by artists local to Santa Cruz County. Because of its unusual focus on contemporary work, the New York Times has called the Festival a \\"mecca for new-music lovers.\\" References  External links  * Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music (official website) Category:Classical music festivals in the United States Category:Contemporary classical music festivals Category:Music festivals in California ","title":"Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music"},{"id":"39139970","text":"Charles Henry Smithson Blakey (4 January 1896 ‚Äì 31 August 1962) was an English footballer who made 30 appearances in the Football League playing for Lincoln City as a goalkeeper.

Neu?, recorded at a 1996 concert in Tokyo during the band's Japanese tour. The album consists of the second half of the 3¬Ω hour concert, during which time the band played an extended 1¬æ hour version of La D√ºsseldorf's 1978 song Cha Cha 2000 (which was written by La! Neu?'s frontman Klaus Dinger). The album is regarded as the pinnacle of La! Neu?'s and Dinger's artistic achievements by many, and continues to be the best selling album released by Captain Trip Records. Background to tour In early 1996 Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother met in D√ºsseldorf to review their ongoing legal battle with Metronome Records for the rights to the three original Neu! albums which they made together in the 1970s. Metronome had offered to compromise with Dinger and Rother by giving the two musicians a sizable proportion of the profits made from a reissue of the albums and by financing promotional activities, possibly including a world tour. Whilst Dinger was willing to accept this offer, Rother was more hesitant, still hoping to secure full ownership of the recordings. In the meantime, Dinger spoke to Ken Matsutani (the head of Captain Trip Records which was at that time releasing Dinger's post-Neu! back catalogue), and Matsutani began looking for venues in Japan for the upcoming tour. Matsutani discovered two venues which were interested in hosting Neu! - Muse Hall in Osaka and On Air West in Tokyo. In early 1996 Cluster (a band associated with Neu! and particularly with Michael Rother) had visited both venues as part of a world tour and produced the album Japan 1996 Live from the result. Dinger and Neu! (like Cluster) had a comparatively large following in Japan, and it was anticipated that any Neu! concerts arranged would be well attended. Michael Rother was unwilling to commit to a tour, however, much to Dinger's annoyance. Rather than back out of the conversations he was having with Tokyo and Osaka, Dinger decided to offer the services of a new group he had been building around Andreas Reihse of Kreidler and Victoria Wehrmeister of Superbilk. In reference to Neu! and La D√ºsseldorf he named the new band La! Neu?, and was quickly accepted by owner of the venues - Hirokazu Nambu (Dinger admitted that Nambu was taking a \\"risk\\"\\"Cha Cha 2000 - Live in Tokyo Vol. 1\\" CD booklet in inviting the unknown La! Neu?). In Germany he finalised the group's debut album D√ºsseldorf and prepared to take an extended 8-man line-up with him to Japan. In the summer of 1996 Dinger was consumed with the organisation (by mail and fax) of an exhibition of his visual art in Auckland, New Zealand. Kerry Aberhard - the curator of the art gallery and a fan of Dinger's work - offered to fly to Japan in advance of La! Neu? to assist the group during their tour. Tour and concert setting In late November 1996 Kerry Aberhard flew to Osaka and was met on 1 December by Ken Matsutani and members of Matsutani's band \\"Marble Sheep\\" (who had travelled from Tokyo). They \\"filled time drinking scotch in [Kerry's hotel] room\\"CD booklet until Dinger and La! Neu? were due to arrive later that day. At 8:30 PM Aberhard and Marble Sheep travelled to the airport to meet La! Neu?, whose flight was slightly delayed. This was the first time Dinger had met his label head face- to-face, and the first time he had been to Japan. They stayed overnight in Osaka (where it was snowing heavily) and performed at Muse Hall on 2 December. The stage had a rope stretched at shoulder-height across it, from which hung Japanese drums and bells which Dinger played during the concert along with his guitar. He was joined by drummers Thomas Klein and Markus Hofmann (both of Kreidler) as well as bassist and contrabassist Konstantin Wienstroer, guitarist Dirk Flader, vocalist Victoria Wehrmeister and keyboardists Andreas Reihse and Rembrandt Lensink. The concert went well, featuring much the same set list as the Tokyo concert. The following day, the entourage travelled to Tokyo, arriving slightly behind schedule. The stage was set up in much the same way as in Osaka, with the addition of a 3m square La! Neu? banner created by artist Yuri Shibata. Before the concert the band dined on noodles. Concert tickets bore the cryptic legend \\"Psychedelic Originators For Space Age Vol. 6\\",CD booklet and sold well. Performance After a set featuring samples of Dinger's music from 1978 onwards, Dinger playfully asked the audience if they would \\"like a bit of cha-cha-cha\\",disc 2 before starting the signature riff of Cha Cha 2000. Dinger incorporated samples of a conversation with his mother and several new lyrics to the song, the band playing for roughly an hour, at one point inviting audience members on stage to participate. At the hour mark the music was brought down and the song's middle section begun, in this version featuring contrabass and piano solos from Wienstroer and Lensink. A tribal drum beat provided by Hofmann and Klein gradually merged into the signature riff, before the concert concluded with layers of guitar feedback and Dinger's farewell to the audience. La! Neu? soon returned to Germany; Dinger carrying the tapes as well as a large collection of photographs and objects from Japan in his luggage. Production and mastering The album was mastered by Dinger in February 1997. Some time before that, Dinger's home had been burgled and the video tapes of the concert stolen (along with memorabilia such as Yuri Shibata's banner). At the time of mastering, Dinger decided to reverse the order of the song's two halves, putting the last 50 minutes on disc 1 and the first hour on disc 2. He did this because‚Äî Dinger designed cover artwork in 1997 which was later scrapped in favour of a painting by Victoria Wehrmeister (although it survives as an inset at the bottom-right of Wehrmeister's image). He also pieced together an extensive booklet featuring photographs of the band in Japan and onstage and commentaries from Ken Matsutani and Kerry Aberhard. The album was released in March 1998 by Captain Trip Records. The first half of the concert would be released the following year under the title Live in Tokyo 1996 Vol. 2.

Wallpack Ridge separates the Wallpack Valley from the valley of the Delaware River (also known as the Minisink or Minisink Valley), and contains the watershed of the Flat Brook and its main tributaries Big Flat Brook and Little Flat Brook.Witte, Ron W., and Monteverde Don H. \\"Geological History of New Jersey's Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province\\" (Trenton, New Jersey: New Jersey Geological and Water Survey. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, 2012). It is a narrow valley, roughly in length running from Montague Township south of Port Jervis, New York to the Walpack Bend in the Delaware River near Flatbrookville in Walpack Township where the Flat Brook enters the Delaware at 300 feet above sea level.Delaware River Basin Commission. \\"Section 6: Sussex County\\" from Flood Mitigation Plan for the Non- tidal, New Jersey section of the Delaware River Basin (November 2008), 244.Witte, Ron W., and Monteverde Don H. \\"Karst in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area\\" from Unearthing New Jersey (Newsletter) Vol. 2 No. 1 Winter 2006. (Trenton: New Jersey Geological Survey, Department of Environmental Protection, 2006). Haneys Mill is a section of Walpack. A grist mill was built there around 1860. It appears on the Sussex County wall map of that year with a nearby sawmill, a lime kiln, and residences of C. Haney, J.W. Fuller and B.D. Fuller. Serving at various times as a gristmill, a sawmill and a cidermill, the last operator was Jake Haney. The mid-nineteenth century farmhouse of the Haney family also stood nearby. Some of the scenes from the 1933 Ford Motor Company promotional film \\"These Thirty Years\\" were filmed here. In the movie, the place was known as the Haines farm; across the road in front of the house were the barns where the auction scene was filmed.\\"Landmarks\\" Walpack Historical Society, n.d. Web 18 July 2013 http://www.walpackhistory.org/index.php/landmarks After the floods in the 1950s, which raised the water of the Delaware ABOVE the level of the roads alongside it, a controversial project to build a hydroelectric dam and reservoir on the Delaware River in the 1950s and 1960s led to government's seizure of land in northwestern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The construction of the dam would have created a lake reservoir that would have flooded the Walpack Valley. For political and geological reasons, the dam project was deauthorized and the land transferred to the management of the National Park Service for the establishment of a National Recreation Area.Feiveson, Harold; Sinden, Frank; and Socolow, Robert. Boundaries of Analysis: an Inquiry Into the Tocks Island Dam Controversy. (1976); Albert, Richard C. Damming the Delaware: The Rise and Fall of Tocks Island Dam (State College, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1987). Currently, Wallpack Ridge is located in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area that was established by the National Park Service in 1978.

The grape is often confused with several other red wine varieties such as Cabernet Franc, Durif, Fer and Prunelard with B√©quignol noir sharing several synonyms with these grapes. However DNA profiling has shown B√©quignol noir to be distinct from those grape varieties. Further research in 2011 showed that B√©quignol noir may have a parent-offspring relationship with the Savagnin grape.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 99, Allen Lane 2012 History B√©quignol noir is often confused with the Southwest France wine grape Fer (pictured). Ampelographers believe that the name B√©quignol comes from the Gascon dialect terms b√©c and inhol which together means literally \\"little beak\\" and could be a reference to the size of the berries. The first written record of B√©quignol noir comes from the journals of mayor of Libourne Antoine Feuilhade who wrote about the grape being cultivated in the Bordeaux wine region between 1763 and 1777. Relationship to other grapes B√©quignol noir has long been confused with many other Southwestern France and Bordeaux wine grape varieties such as Cabernet Franc, Fer, Prunelard and Durif with the grapes sharing many synonyms. However, DNA analysis in 1999 confirmed that B√©quignol noir was its own grape variety distinct from those other grapes with further research in 2011 suggesting a parent-offspring relationship between B√©quignol noir and the Jura wine grape Savagnin. It is not yet clear which grape is the parent and which is the offspring. B√©quignol blanc and B√©quignol gris are white and grey color mutations of B√©quignol noir that are rarely seen. Viticulture B√©quignol noir is a mid to late ripening grape variety that tends to produce very small berries. The vine can be very vigorous and high yielding. While it is resistant to drought conditions, the vine is very susceptible to the viticultural hazard of mites. Wine regions Outside of its French homeland B√©quignol noir is widely planted in the Mendoza province of Argentina. Though B√©quignol noir originated in France, today it is rarely seen with less than 1 hectare (2.5 acres) of the grape reported in 2008 all in the Gironde and Vend√©e regions where it is still an authorized variety for wine production. This has been a steady drop since 1958 when there were 223 ha/551 acres of the variety in cultivation. The vast majority of the world's B√©quignol noir plantings are in Argentina where the grape is also known as Red Chenin. In 2008, there were 919 hectares (2,271 acres) of the grape in Argentina with most of the plantings found in the high altitude vineyards of the Mendoza. Here the grape is used similarly to Douce noir (Bonarda) in adding color to darken up red wine blends. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson B√©quignol noir tends to produce light-bodied wines with a deep color that are usually meant to be consumed young. Synonyms Over the years B√©quignol noir has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Balouzat, Bequignaou, B√©quignol Noir, Bequinaou, B√©quin rouge (in Saint-Macaire and La R√©ole in the Gironde), Bequin rouge, Blanc Fer, Breton (in Dissay in the Poitou-Charentes region), Cabernet (in Dissay), Camerouge, Chalosse noir, Chalosse noire (in the Bas-M√©doc of Bordeaux), Chausse, Chausset, Durif, Egrenant, Embalouzat (in the Entre-Deux-Mers), Enrageat rouge, Grosse Here, Here, Jurancon, Man√ßais noir (in the Indre-et-Loire), Maouron, Mauron, Micardeau, Negrotte, Noir Cimrah, Noir de Cimrah, Noir de Valin, Petit Fer, Plant de Dissay, Prunalet, Prunelard, Raboso Piave, Red Chenin and Sencit Gris.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) B√©quignol noir Accessed: April 17th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties de:B√©quignol fr:B√©quignol ","title":"B√©quignol noir"},{"id":"39140012","text":"Isaac \\"Ike\\" Bird (14 August 1895 ‚Äì 22 June 1984) was an English footballer who made eight appearances in the Football League playing for Lincoln City as an inside left.

Prior to playing professionally, Bryant attended the University of San Diego, where he played college baseball for the Toreros. Bryant starred in baseball for Bonanza High School. In college, he was named an All-American in 2012 and 2013, and won the Dick Howser Trophy and Golden Spikes Award in 2013. The Cubs selected him with the second overall selection in the 2013 MLB draft and he quickly became one of the top prospects in baseball, winning the USA Today Minor League Player of the Year Award and Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year Award in 2014. Bryant made his major league debut in 2015. He was named an MLB All-Star and won the National League's (NL) Rookie of the Year Award. He was again named an All- Star in 2016, won a World Series championship with the Cubs, and was named the NL's Most Valuable Player. Amateur career Bryant attended Bonanza High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. Playing for the school's varsity baseball team all four years, he recorded a .418 batting average, a .958 slugging percentage (SLG), 103 hits, and 47 career home runs. He also played American Legion Baseball. USA Today named him to their All-USA baseball first-team in 2010. The Toronto Blue Jays selected Bryant in the 18th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. He did not sign, and enrolled at the University of San Diego, to play college baseball for the San Diego Toreros baseball team. As a freshman at the University of San Diego in 2011, Bryant had a .365 batting average, a .482 on-base percentage (OBP), and a .599 SLG, with nine home runs. He was named a freshman All-American by Louisville Slugger and the West Coast Conference (WCC) Co-Freshman of the Year and Co-Player of the Year, sharing both honors with Marco Gonzales. Following his freshman season at San Diego, Bryant played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham Anglers of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he batted 29-for-130 (.223) with three home runs and 16 RBIs. As a sophomore in 2012, Bryant batted .366 with a .671 SLG, 14 home runs, and 57 RBIs. He was again named first team All-WCC and he was also named a first-team All-American by Baseball America. That summer, Bryant was selected by USA Baseball to play for the United States collegiate national team. In the 2013 season as a junior, Bryant hit 31 home runs to lead the nation. Bryant had the most home runs hit by a college player since the NCAA switched to a BBCOR composite bat in 2011. Bryant broke the previous record of 30 set by Georgia Southern's Victor Roache in 2011 and amounted to more home runs than 223 of 296 Division I teams hit that season. Bryant won the Golden Spikes Award and the Dick Howser Trophy, which are both awarded to the top collegiate player in the nation. He was also named a Louisville Slugger First Team All-American, the Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year, and the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Player of the Year. Professional career Draft and minor leagues Daytona Cubs in September 2013 Bryant was considered to be one of the best available players in the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. The Houston Astros, who had the first overall pick, scouted Bryant. Bryant believed he would be chosen by the Colorado Rockies, who had the third selection of the draft. After the Astros selected pitcher Mark Appel with the first overall selection, the Chicago Cubs chose Bryant with the second pick. This choice was surprising as the Cubs were expected to select a pitcher. The Cubs later acknowledged that they would have selected Appel had he still been available. Many baseball executives and scouts agreed that Bryant was the safest pick in the draft. He was also rated as the best hitter in the draft because of his abilities hitting for power and making contact on inside fastballs as well as down-and-away curveballs. Bryant and the Cubs came to terms on a contract with a $6.7 million signing bonus two days prior to the signing deadline. Bryant began his professional career with the Boise Hawks of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, where he batted .354 with four home runs. He was promoted to the Daytona Cubs of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League on August 12. He hit .333 with five home runs for Daytona. After the season, he played in Arizona Fall League (AFL). He was named co-player of the week, along with Mitch Haniger, in the first week of the fall league season. He was named the MVP of the AFL after hitting .364/.457/.727 with six home runs in 20 games. Bryant started 2014 with the Tennessee Smokies of the Class AA Southern League. In June, he won the Home Run Derby and participated in the All-Star game. On June 18, the Cubs promoted Bryant to the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League after batting .355 with 22 home runs and 58 RBIs in 68 games with Tennessee. He played in the All-Star Futures Game in July. At the end of the regular season, Bryant's 43 combined home runs between Tennessee and Iowa won him the Joe Bauman Home Run Award. Bryant was named the USA Today Minor League Player of the Year and Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year. Baseball America named him the No. 1 prospect in 2015. Bryant playing for the Iowa Cubs in July 2014 Bryant was invited to spring training by the Cubs in 2015. In 40 at-bats, he hit nine home runs, which led all players. He had a .425 with a .477 on-base percentage and a 1.175 slugging percentage. Despite his performance, the Cubs elected to send Bryant back down to Iowa. Baseball analysts assumed that the service-time rules in baseball was the majority influence on the team's decision; if Bryant were to play 12 days in the minors before being promoted to the majors, the Cubs would receive another year of club control. The MLBPA issued a statement saying, \\"Today is a bad day for baseball\\". In seven games with the Iowa, Bryant hit three home runs and batted .321. Chicago Cubs = 2015 season = On April 17, 2015, Bryant was called up to the majors by the Cubs. He made his debut that day at Wrigley Field, going 0-for-4 with three strikeouts. The next day at Wrigley, Bryant recorded his first hit, an RBI single. Bryant hit his first major league home run on May 9, off Milwaukee Brewers' Kyle Lohse. His second home run came two days later at Wrigley Field against the New York Mets off Jacob deGrom.

In a July 4 game against the Miami Marlins, Bryant hit both a two-run home run and his second grand slam of the season off Jarred Cosart. This made him the second Cubs rookie to hit two grand slams since Billy Williams in 1961. Bryant was selected as an injury replacement selection for Giancarlo Stanton on the National League roster of the All-Star Game in Cincinnati, Ohio. He also participated in the Home Run Derby. On July 25, against the Philadelphia Phillies, Bryant flew out at the warning track for the last out of Cole Hamels' no-hitter. On July 27, Bryant hit his first career walk-off home run, a two-run shot, off John Axford in a 9‚Äì8 win over the Colorado Rockies. On September 6, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Bryant hit a home run, the longest of the 2015 MLB season, off Rubby De La Rosa. With the home run, Bryant tied Williams (1961) and Geovany Soto (2008), for the Cubs' franchise single-season RBI record for rookies with 86. On September 11, he broke the record by driving in a run with a double. On September 22, Bryant passed Williams for the most home runs by a Cubs rookie, with 26. In 151 games of his first season in the Majors, Bryant batted .275 with 26 home runs, 31 doubles, and 99 RBIs, which were the most for a rookie since Albert Pujols's 130 for the St. Louis Cardinals in 2001. Bryant struck out 199 times, which led the National League and set a new rookie record. He had the lowest contact percentage on his swings in the major leagues (66.3%).Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2015 ¬ª Batters ¬ª Plate Discipline Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball According to sales on Major League Baseball's official website, Bryant had the best-selling jersey in all of baseball during the 2015 regular season. With the Cubs finishing the season, 97‚Äì65, the team clinched a Wild Card spot in the MLB postseason, their first playoff berth in seven years. Despite Bryant not having any hits in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game, the Cubs shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates, 4‚Äì0, and advanced to the 2015 National League Division Series (NLDS), where in Game 3, Bryant hit a two-run home run against the rival St. Louis Cardinals to help the Cubs to an 8‚Äì6 win. The Cubs won the series winning three-games-to-one, but lost to the New York Mets in the 2015 National League Championship Series (NLCS) in a four-game sweep. Bryant was named the Baseball America Rookie of the Year for the 2015 season, making him the first in history to win the Baseball America college player, minor league player, and major league rookie of the year awards in successive seasons. He was voted the \\"Esurance MLB Awards\\" Best Rookie ‚Äì by fans, the media, former players, team front-office personnel, and the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR). Bryant won the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award for the National League, becoming the first Cub to earn it since Soto in 2008. Further, he was the unanimous winner from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) of the Jackie Robinson National League Rookie of the Year Award, becoming the 11th National League player to win by a unanimous vote, and the 20th player overall. He was also named by his fellow players as the \\"Players Choice Awards\\" National League Outstanding Rookie. After the 2015 season, Bryant filed a grievance against the Cubs for delaying his call-up to the majors for the purpose of delaying his free agency. About the grievance Bryant said, \\"For me it‚Äôs just important to continue to go out there and do what I do, so that I can help the team in any way possible in where we‚Äôre at today,\\" Bryant added, \\"It's just important for me to not even worry about it right now because it takes away from so much of what we have going this year. And that was last year‚Äôs news.\\" , the grievance had yet to reach a hearing. = 2016 season: NL MVP = The Cubs gave Bryant a $652,000 salary for the 2016 season, a 38% increase over his rookie salary.

He hit a first-inning home run off Chris Sale of the Chicago White Sox, his first career home run in an All-Star Game. In the opening game of a late August series against the National League West-division leading Los Angeles Dodgers, Bryant hit an eighth-inning home run to tie the game and the winning two-run home run in the 10th inning for a 6‚Äì4 victory.

In college, he majored in biology before switching to finance. Bryant's father, Mike, played in minor league baseball for the Boston Red Sox organization. Mike owned a patio furniture store but sold it in order to get a job that permitted him to coach his son. Bryant and fellow baseball players Bryce Harper and Joey Gallo grew up as acquaintances in the Las Vegas area, and began playing baseball with each other at the age of 9. Bryant and Harper's friendly competition was displayed in the May 2015 series against the Washington Nationals at Wrigley Field, when they greeted each other for the first time in the Major Leagues. Bryant proposed to long- time girlfriend Jessica Delp in December 2015. They both grew up in Las Vegas and had dated since they were 16. They were married on January 7, 2017, with one of the groomsmen being Bryant's teammate, Anthony Rizzo. They have one child, a son, who was born in April 2020, named Kyler Lee Bryant. https://sports.yahoo.com/cubs-kris-bryant-wife-jessica-223732146.html References External links *San Diego Toreros bio * * Category:1992 births Category:All-American college baseball players Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:Arizona League Cubs players Category:Baseball players from Nevada Category:Boise Hawks players Category:Chatham Anglers players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Daytona Cubs players Category:Golden Spikes Award winners Category:Iowa Cubs players Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award winners Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Mesa Solar Sox players Category:National League All-Stars Category:National League Most Valuable Player Award winners Category:San Diego Toreros baseball players Category:Sportspeople from the Las Vegas Valley Category:Tennessee Smokies players ","title":"Kris Bryant"},{"id":"39140064","text":"Chaudhry Fateh Muhammad Sial (1887-1960) was a companion of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and the first Ahmadi missionary sent from India, under the leadership of Hakeem Noor-ud-Din, the first Khalifa of the Ahmadiyya movement.Tareekh e Ahmadiyyat, Vol. 3, page 457.

In 1914, the second Ahmadiyya Khalifa, Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad, instructed Fateh Muhammad Sial to purchase a property where a mosque could be built for the Muslim community. In August 1920, Fateh Muhammad Sial acquired a one-acre site at Southfields which became active mission house and his main base of operation, but within the space of a few years the Mission House was no longer sufficient and plans for a construction of a mosque on the site were finalised. The Fazl Mosque (also known as the London Mosque) in London was inaugurated on October 23, 1926.

History On 16 April 1924 Pope Pius XI established the Prefecture Apostolic of San Miguel de Sucumb√≠os from the Apostolic Vicariate of Napo. Pope John Paul II elevated it to an Apostolic Vicariate on 2 July 1984. It remains exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See, not part of an ecclesiastical province.  Nomination conflict with the Ecuadorian state  In October 2010, after L√≥pez Mara√±on of the Discalced Carmelites retired at the mandatory age of 75, the Holy See appointed Rafael Ibarguren, of the Heralds of the Gospel as Apostolic Administrator (ad interim for the Ordinary) of the Vicariate Apolistic. Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa objected to the nomination as he considered Ibarguren 'ultraconservative and fundamentalist', he also feared that Ibarguren would destroy all the social work his predecessor had achieved. Correa asserted that he could veto the nomination of Ibarguren on the basis of a Modus vivendi agreement between Ecuador and the Holy See. The Episcopal Conference of Ecuador asserted otherwise. Relations between the two entities were strained and believers within Sucumb√≠os were divided in those supporting the Heralds of the Gospel and those who did not. On 5 December 2011, Pope Benedict XVI named Paolo Mietto Apolostic Administrator. This member of the missionary Congregation of Saint Joseph was succeeded by a fellow Josephite Celmo Lazzari, the former Apostolic Vicar of neighbouring 'mother vicariate' Napo, as Apostolic vicar.

Focused on improving programs and policies for low-income people, MDRC designs new interventions, evaluates existing programs using the highest research standards (including randomized controlled trials), and provides technical assistance to build better programs and deliver effective interventions at scale. MDRC is led by President Virginia Knox, Senior Vice President Jes√∫s Amadeo, and Vice Presidents Dan Bloom and Sharon Rowser. The Chair of the MDRC Board of Directors is Mary Jo Bane, Thornton Bradshaw Professor of Public Policy and Management Emerita, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.  Mission  According to its website, MDRC is committed to finding solutions to some of the most difficult problems facing the nation ‚Äî from reducing poverty and bolstering economic self- sufficiency to improving public education and college graduation rates. MDRC designs promising new interventions, evaluates existing programs using the highest research standards, and provides technical assistance to build better programs and deliver effective interventions at scale. It works as an intermediary, bringing together public and private funders to test new policy- relevant ideas, and communicate what we learn to policymakers and practitioners ‚Äî all with the goal of improving the lives of low-income individuals, families, and children.  History  In 1974, the Ford Foundation and six government agencies together created the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. Its purpose was to implement and document the results of new programs intended to help the poor. In the 1980s and 1990s, it became well known for its evaluations of state welfare-to-work programs. It formally adopted \\"MDRC\\" as its registered corporate identity in 2003.  Projects  MDRC projects are in these main areas: *Preschool through twelfth- grade education * Postsecondary education * Disconnected youth * Work and income security * Low-wage workers and communities * Criminal justice *Behavioral science *Data science  Notable accomplishments  MDRC helped pioneer the use of random assignment to test social programs. Its evaluations of welfare work programs influenced the welfare reform of the 1990s. In the 1990s and 2000s, MDRC‚Äôs evaluation of the Career Academies high school reform model, which showed impacts on participants‚Äô earnings eight years after graduation, influenced the expansion of the model around the nation.

According to reports, the envelope was addressed to the office of Mississippi Republican Senator Roger Wicker. On April 17, 2013, an envelope addressed to President of the United States Barack Obama preliminarily tested positive for ricin. Both letters, which were mailed from Memphis, Tennessee, included the phrases \\"No one wanted to listen to me before. There are still 'Missing Pieces.' Maybe I have your attention now even if that means someone must die. This must stop. To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\\" and \\"I am KC and I approve this message.\\" A third letter mailed to a Mississippi judge, Lee County Justice Court Judge Sadie Holland, that was received and opened on April 10, contained similar language and was sent for testing. The letters tested positive for ricin during FBI testing.  Early suspect released  On April 17, 2013, FBI agents detained a Corinth, Mississippi, man on suspicion of mailing the ricin-laced letters. All charges were dropped however, and he was released on April 23, 2013. Federal investigators reported that they could find no evidence linking him to the letters. An FBI agent testified that no ricin or precursors were found in the man's home, nor did a preliminary forensic analysis of his computer reveal anything related to ricin. The defense attorney claimed in court that his client was being framed, possibly by a man with whom he had been feuding online.  Second arrest  On April 23, agents in hazardous materials suits searched the home of a Tupelo, Mississippi man in connection with the ricin investigation. On April 27, the man, identified as James Everett Dutschke, was arrested in connection with the case. Dutschke was out on $25,000 bail for unrelated state criminal charges of April 1, 2013. Under suspicion since the release of the prior suspect, Dutschke denied the allegations through his lawyer. Saying that new information had been discovered in the case, authorities who had placed his house under surveillance arrested Dutschke in the early hours of April 27. Later that day, Dutschke was charged with attempted use of a biological weapon. On June 3, 2013, Dutschke was indicted by a federal grand jury on five counts. He was indicted for producing and using the deadly toxin as a weapon, and using the mail to threaten President Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lee County Judge Sadie Holland. In May 2014, Dutschke pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Immediately following this, the larger scope of combat engagements in the area of Stepanakert took place, including the use of BM-21 \\"Grad\\" artillery and Mil Mi-24 assault helicopters through to February 1992. The division, along with the other three divisions of the 4th Army, was ordered to be withdrawn amidst the fighting in the Nagorno-Karabakh War in May and June.

Suzanne Goldenberg. Russian deserters join Armenians. However, on June 21, 1992, the divisional column was prevented from departing Ganja by the civilian Azerbaijani population. The Azerbaijanis demanded that the division surrender its military equipment during Azeri declaration of independence, and the division commander, General Major Yury Pokhamov, complied to avoid civilian casualties. This was largely due to a lack of direction and indecision at Headquarters Transcaucasian Military District and at the General Staff. This did not occur because for the most part the officers of the 366th Motor Rifle Regiment had begun to offer assistance to the Armenian population, while the units based in Ganja deciding to side with the Azeri population. This was largely due to about 50 of the remaining 350 personnel of the 366th Motor Rifle Regiment being Armenian, including the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Major Seyran Ohanyan.de Waal.

Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, Retrieved on 2013-05-31. At least seventeen provinces of the Philippines have grown sugarcane, of which the two on Negros Island account for half of the nation's total production. As of crop year 2009-2010, 29 sugar mills are operational divided as follows: thirteen mills on Negros, six mills on Luzon, four mills on Panay, three mills in Eastern Visayas and three mills on Mindanao. Sugarcane is not a sensitive crop and can be grown in almost all types of soil, from sandy to clay loams and from acidic volcanic soils to calcareous sedimentary deposits. The harvest period is from October to December and ends in May. In 2015, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts of the Philippines announced that they will include the Industrial Sugar Central Sites of the Philippines and related properties to the UNESCO World Heritage List. History The history of the sugar industry in the Philippines pre-dates Spanish colonization. Early Arab traders brought from the Celebes cuttings of sugarcane and planted them in Mindanao. Later sugar were shipped north and planted in the Visayas and Luzon. By 1521, beginning of the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines, sugarcane farming was already extensive on many islands, particularly in the Visayas. Sugarcane farming became an industry after 1856 when Nicholas Loney, a British Vice-Consul, was sent to Iloilo City and convinced the American house of Russell & Sturgishttp://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~bak00140 to open a branch in Iloilo for the purpose of giving crop loans to sugar planters. Loney through his firm, Loney and Kee Company, facilitated the fast development of sugar industry by importing sugar cuttings from Sumatra and machinery from England and Scotland to Iloilo, which the sugar planters can buy on easy installment loans. Loney also built sailing boats called lorcha (boat)s, patterned after the Brixham trawlers used for deep-sea fishing in the English channel, at Buenavista on Guimaras Island to transport sugar from Negros Island. Envisioning the prosperity of a sugar industry in Visayas in the near future, Loney initiated its development in Negros and offered liberal terms to a few Negrense planters similar to those he had given the Ilonggo planters. Consequently, some prominent Ilonggo sugarcane planters like the Ledesma, Lacson, Hilado, Cosculluela, P√©rez, Alvarez, Sotamayor and Escanilla families moved to Negros in 1857 due to its promising development. The raw sugar which the Visayas‚Äô main product was exported to the United States, England and Australia. Crystal grain sugar was the product of Manila which was exported primarily to Spain.  The Philippines main agricultural export commodity (late 1700s‚Äì1970s) Sugar became the most important agricultural export of the Philippines between the late eighteenth century and the mid-1970s because of two main reasons: 1) foreign exchange earned and 2) it was the basis of wealth accumulation of some Filipino elite at that time. To ensure the continuous growth and development of sugar industry under the Philippine Commonwealth government, Philippine Sugar Administration (PSA) was established in 1937 to oversee the industry. After the Second World War the Sugar Quota Administration (SQA) replaced PSA in 1951 vis-√†-vis with Philippine Sugar Institute (PHILSUGIN), a research agency. During the 1950s and 1960s, more than 20 percent of Philippine exports came from the sugar industry. It declined in the 1970s and plunged further in the first half of the 1980s to roughly 7 percent. It was during this period that the government acknowledged the existence of crisis in the industry. One of the factors that contributed to the worsening situation of the industry during that time was the depressed market for sugar. In 1974, there was a dramatic escalation in the world price that peaked at around US$0.67 per pound of sugar. In succeeding two consecutive years, world prices of sugar fell to less than US$0.10 and remain in that situation for few years until it moved upward before the decade ends. During the early 1980s, world sugar prices fell again, with US$0.03 per pound as the bottom. Prices recovered to US$0.14 per pound then fell again to between $0.08 to 0.09 per pound at the beginning of the early 1990s. Free trade with the United States and the Quota System The transfer of Philippines as a colony from the Spanish to the Americans was not easy due to strong resistance from Filipino leader Emilio Aguinaldo. Soon after the fall of Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela, the Philippines was completely under the American rule. The Americans, unlike their predecessors, provided partial liberty to the Filipinos by preparing the latter to achieve independence and run its own government through a Commonwealth form of state. The initial resistance turned into market cooperation that emanated from trust and good will of Filipino people towards the American colonizers and vice versa. United States‚Äô colonization of the Philippines protected the country from vicissitudes of world sugar prices due to its free access to a protected and subsidized American market, which started in 1913, when the United States established free trade with its Philippine colony. The United States treated the Philippines like one of its American states that resulted to state protection of the Philippine sugar market. Twenty-one years later in 1934, the United States enacted a quota system on sugar that remained enforced until early 70s. In 1965, U.S. Sugar Act was amended to provide the following terms in Quota system: * A basic quota of 1,050,000 short tons plus 10.86% of any U.S. consumption increase from 9.7 million to 10.4 million tons or a total basic quota of 1,126,000 short tons for the Philippines; * 47.22% of the deficits of U.S. domestic producers and other foreign country suppliers which conservatively is estimated to be about 200,000 tons, shall be allotted to the Philippines; * The encouragement, if not a requirement that the Philippines maintain in reserve the equivalent of 15% of her U.S. quotas or roughly 180,000 tons; * The premium recapture fee and a quarterly system of allocation during the first semester of each calendar year. Despite restrictions on sugar trading, exports of Philippine sugar to the U.S. remained in a relatively privileged position especially during the 70s. Philippine quotas for the United States ranged between 25 and 30 percent, a rate that is higher than other sugar suppliers like the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Brazil. Early Decline Philippines exported sugar on the world market, generally to unrestricted locations, after U.S. quota law on sugar reached its expiration in 1974. Consequently, sugar shipments to the United States declined during this period. A quota system for the sugar importation was renewed by the United States on May 5, 1982. However sugar allocations were based on a country‚Äôs share in sugar trade with the United States in 1975 to 1981, the periods when exports of Philippine sugar to United States decreased; during this period, allocations of Philippine sugar was only 13.5 percent about half compared to its allocations in the early 1970s. Efforts to make allocations raised to 25 percent were failed. The imposition of new quota system for sugar compounded by remarkable drop of 40 percent in total American imports of sugar in the mid-1980s resulted to huge loss of sales to the Philippines. The negative effect was greatly felt in the island of Negros, where sugar industry is directly responsible for 25 percent of employment of local farm workers. Government Monopolization (1970s) In the 70s, President Ferdinand Marcos and his economic advisers argued that pervasive market failures were the root cause of the decline of the sugar industry. In order to rescue the industry, central coordination was crucial. The Marcos Administration followed a diffusionist argument, calling for government to replace the market in order to stimulate the market development of the sugar industry Meier, G.M. (2001). ‚ÄúThe Old Generation of Development Economics and the New.‚Äù In G. Meier and J. Stiglitz (Eds.), Frontiers of Development Economics: the Future in Perspective (pp. 13-50). Oxford: Oxford University Press. In 1976, in response to precipitous declines in sugar prices, President Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 3888 (and amended by Presidential Decree Nos. 775 and 1192), ordering the establishment of the Philippine Sugar Commission (PHILSUCOM). This commission assumed the functions of both SQA and PHILSUGIN, and was given the sole power to buy and sell sugar, set prices paid to planters and millers, and purchase companies connected to the sugar industry. In May 1978, the Republic Planters Bank was established to provide adequate and timely financing to the sugar industry. To minimize the impact of fluctuating world sugar prices during this period, PHILSUCOM established a protective pricing policy, entering into four-year term contracts. These contracts assured that 50 percent of exported sugar would be sold at an average price of 23.5 U.S. Cents per pound, an amount lesser than the prevailing world rate of 30 U.S. Cents per pound. This was followed by the government's monopolization of the sugar industry. Contrary to expectations, government substitution in the market did not improve the industry. PHILSUCOM and its trading subsidiary, the National Sugar Trading Corporation (NASUTRA), were tainted with controversies. According to the findings of a study conducted by a group of economists in the University of the Philippines (U.P.), sugar producers' losses reached an estimated value between 11 to 14 billion Philippine Pesos during the period between 1974 and 1983. Establishment of Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) After the 1986 Revolution, which ousted Marcos, President Corazon Aquino immediately appointed Fred J. Elizalde as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the institutions that will regulate the sugar industry since the administration that time was technically in revolutionary form of government. On May 28, 1986, Executive Order No. 18 established the current Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA). The SRA was mandated to carry out the following functions: to institute an orderly system in sugarcane production for the stable, sufficient and balanced production of sugar; to establish and maintain a balanced relation between production and requirement of sugar, and marketing conditions as will stabilize prices; to promote the effective merchandising of sugar and its products; to undertake studies to the formulate policies. Sugar Industry and the Philippine Economy Annual production of sugar contributes about 69.7 billion pesos to the national GDP with Value Added Tax (VAT) on the sale of refined sugar reaching over 1.92 billion pesos yearly. Sugar is primarily produced in Western Visayas, as well as in Central Luzon, and some parts of Mindanao. As of Crop Year 2007-08, the province of Negros Occidental accounted for 54% of sugar produced and accounted for 18 billion pesos of Negros' GDP. It is estimated that as of 2012, the industry provides direct employment to 700,000 sugarcane workers spread across 19 sugar producing provinces. In 1998 alone, investments to sugar industry have amounted to 20 billion pesos, according to the Board of Investments. These investments are private sector secured, sourced and funded, without cost or security from government. Sugar industry has a social component, benefiting sugarcane workers. Through the Social Amelioration Fund (SAF), a lien is imposed on the volume of sugar produced. This fund is shouldered by sugar planters and millers and collected by the Bureau of Rural Workers. The benefits for the sugarcane workers under the lien include cash bonus, death benefit, maternity benefit, educational grant and livelihood projects. The sugar industry funds its own research, development and extension programs through the Philippine Sugar Research Institute Foundation, Inc. (PHILSURIN) with aim to develop high yielding cane varieties. The Philippine government, through SRA, provides the extension efforts in partnerships with the Mill District Development Councils (MDDC). PHILSURIN assists this initiative through the hiring of Mill District Coordinators and financial support to many programs of the MDDC. The sugar industry is in alternative energy sources which include biofuel through bioethanol production and co-generation activities. Sub-sectors The sugar industry has two major sub-sectors: the farming sub-sector and the milling sub-sector. Farming Sub-sector There are at least 11 regions/19 provinces that produce sugarcane in the nation. A range from 360,000 to 390,000 hectares are devoted to sugarcane production. The largest sugarcane areas are found in the Negros Island Region, which accounts for 51% of sugarcane areas planted. This is followed by Mindanao which accounts for 20%; Luzon by 17%; Panay by 07%; and Eastern Visayas by 04%. It is estimated that as of 2012, the industry provides direct employment to 700,000 sugarcane workers spread across 19 sugar-producing provinces. Milling Sub-sector As of Crop Year 2012-2013, 29 mills are operational divided as follows: 13 mills in Negros, 6 mills in Luzon, 4 mills in Panay, 3 mills in Eastern Visayas and 3 mills in Mindanao.

He played for Eton in 1834, 1835, 1837 and 1838, captaining the side in the last two years but missing the 1836 season entirely. The obituary claims that Pickering's strength was his fielding: \\"He generally fielded at cover-point, and, being ambidextrous, ran out, by returning the ball with his left hand, many batsmen who had forgotten this peculiarity.\\" After Eton he went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge. Surrey Pickering was instrumental in the foundation of Surrey County Cricket Club, speaking at a meeting of Surrey cricketers in October 1845 to explain the objectives of the newly formed club: i.e., to develop the cricketing strength of the county and provide it with \\"a local habitation and a name\\".Altham, pp.96‚Äì97. Pickering played in two of Surrey's earliest matches in 1846 and 1848; also representing the Surrey Club against Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1846. Canada After 1848, Pickering's playing career diminished and he made only two recorded appearances, both in minor matches for I Zingari, from 1849 to 1851. He then emigrated to Canada and was active as a player there until he returned to England in either 1859 or 1860. Pickering played for the Canadian national team against the United States on four occasions between 1853 and 1857. Pickering was involved with the Montreal Cricket Club, which was the leading cricket body in North American cricket in the 1850s. In 1856, he proposed that an English team should tour North America on the guarantee of the Montreal Club. Negotiations between various parties lasted three years and were finally concluded during Canterbury Week in August 1859. As a result, George Parr led the first English touring team to North America in September and October that year, the twelve players receiving ¬£50 each plus expenses from the Montreal Club.Altham, p.129. Pickering made four appearances in matches involving Parr's team. Pickering had returned to England by the summer of 1860 and was a frequent member of I Zingari teams until 1872. He became a member of the London Stock Exchange but at the time of his death \\"had emigrated to Canada some years ago\\". He was recorded in five matches in Toronto between 1877 and 1879. He died 16 August 1905 in Vancouver, British Columbia.

It includes the villages of Llanfair-yng- Nghornwy, Llanrhyddlad and Rhydwyn, plus Llanrhwydrys, the north west tip of the island at Carmel Head, and the offshore islands of the Skerries and West Mouse. At the 2001 census the community had a population of 675, increasing to 758 at the 2011 census. St Mary's Church at Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy is of early medieval origin and has a chancel arch dating from the 11th or 12th centuries. It is mentioned in the Norwich Taxation of 1254. The chancel was lengthened in the 15th century, and a south chapel added in the 16th. The west tower was added in the 17th century, and the church was restored in 1847, and again in both 1860 and the 1930s. Cadw considers it to be \\"a fine rural parish church, incorporating significant early medieval fabric\\", and claims that it is \\"of special interest, therefore, both for its early origins and for the quality of its later detail,\\" and it is Grade I listed. Saint Rhwydrus's Church, near Cemlyn Bay, was also built in the 12th century, but only the nave survives, although of particular interest is a doorway to the nave dating from that period. It is Grade II* listed, as is Caerau, a late 17th-century house in Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy which contains original panelling. Cemlyn Bay is located in the north east of the community, and is owned by the National Trust. It is the site of a nature reserve managed by the North Wales Wildlife Trust, which includes a lagoon separated from the sea by Esgair Gemlyn, a shingle ridge formed by longshore drift. Islands in the lagoon provide nesting sites for common and Arctic terns, and for one of the United Kingdom's largest breeding populations of Sandwich terns. Offshore, the Skerries lie north west of Carmel Head at the end of a submerged reef which lies directly in the path of shipping traveling between Liverpool and Ireland. In 1714 Queen Anne granted William Trench the right to build a lighthouse on the rocks, and to levy dues on passing ships. The light came into operation in 1717, but ship owners evaded payment, and Trench died in 1729, heavily in debt. The lighthouse was eventually bought by Trinity House in 1841, the last privately owned lighthouse in the British Isles purchased by the organisation. The coal grate was replaced by an oil lamp in 1804, and converted to electric operation in 1927. Since 1987 it has been unmanned, and controlled automatically from Harwich.

History  The Gloucester Fishermen's Wives Association (GFWA) was formed in 1969 and was initially called the United Fishermen's Wives Organization of Gloucester, informally \\"the Wives\\", changing its name to GFWA in 1977. The GFWA started as a group of primarily Sicilian American women, many first-generation immigrants, and initially focused on concerns of local fishermen. However, in the late 1970s the GFWA became active at the state, federal, and international levels as well, lobbying for fisheries conservation and management legislation. GWFA also produced two successful cookbooks and held events throughout New England to promote fishing and protect fishing stock by teaching the public to use species of fish popular in Sicilian cooking, but underused in American. As the work of the GFWA expanded, the group created two sister organizations: Gloucester Fishermen's Wives Memorial, Incorporated (GFWM) in 1982, and Gloucester Fishermen's Wives Development Programs (GFWDP) in 1995. The GFWA continues to promote Gloucester, Massachusetts, the oldest fishing port in the nation, \\"for its beauty and the culture of the people on its working waterfront\\", and is an \\"international model for conserving and protecting fish stocks and a working waterfront for future generations.\\"  Recent work  In 2009 the group started a community supported fishery project - following the community- supported agriculture or CSA model‚Äîin which participants buy a share of the year's catch.Balsinger, Jim. \\"Toward a sustainable community catch.\\" Gloucester Times. September 4, 2009. The Cape Ann Fresh Catch has continued to support local events highlighting the importance of sustainable fisheries, such as the annual \\"Seafood Throwdown\\".Editorial. \\"'Throwdown' event delivers key message on fishery rules\\". Gloucester Times, August 24, 2012.  Memorials  The group, with its sister group GWFM, raised funds for a statue by local Gloucester sculptor Morgan Faulds Pike marking its contributions to the Gloucester community, as well as the role of the fisherman's wife in maintaining households and economies in the community; the statue was dedicated in 2001.Reid, Alexander. \\"Statue Shows Strength of Unsung Wives of Fishermen\\", The Boston Globe.

The band consists of JC Brooks (vocals), Alec Lehrman (guitar), Theodore Berry the IV (bass), Jeremy Tromburg (keyboard), Jovia Armstrong (percussion) and Kevin Marks (drums). Describing their sound as \\"post-punk soul,\\" the band combines elements of funk, soul, indie rock, R&B;, and punk, into a unique take on the soul genre. History The band formed in 2007 when guitarist Billy Bungeroth ‚Äúput an ad on Craigslist with a vision of a multi-racial band that made sexy and political music that you could dance to‚Äù. At the time, JC Brooks was involved in the production of the musical Ragtime. ‚Äú[W]e had just wrapped up rehearsals and were about to open. I was like, ‚ÄòWell, I no longer have rehearsals sucking up my evening ‚Äî let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs out on Craig‚Äôs List.‚Äô So I answered an ad that Billy posted and now I‚Äôve stopped doing theater‚Äù. Other members Ben Taylor (bass), Kevin Marks (drums), joined soon after and together with Billy Bungeroth and JC Brooks formed the original Uptown Sound lineup, later adding keyboardist Andy Rosenstein to round-out the band's sound. In 2009, the band served as the backing band for the Numero Group's ‚ÄúEccentric Soul Revue.‚Äù They played a Chicago date in April, then toured with the Revue in November 2009, backing such influential Chicago soul men as Syl Johnson and Otis Clay. The band participated in the 2011 production of the musical Passing Strange. Brooks played the role of the narrator and protagonist, while the rest of the band provided the music. Also in 2011, JC Brooks and the Uptown Sound performed at Wilco's Solid Sound Festival, where they were joined on-stage by Jeff Tweedy for a performance of their single \\"I'm Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" penned by Tweedy and originally recorded by Wilco on their Yankee Hotel Foxtrot album. In 2012, they played Lollapalooza on the Sony Stage. The band's third full-length album, Howl, was released May 2013 on Bloodshot Records. A review by Paste magazine states the album \\"shows the band's maturation while staying true to the introspective lyrics and big sound for which they're known. According to music blog Indie Shuffle, \\"Howl gives the listener the sense that the band has not only matured with their songwriting, but have understood how to take ownership of a sound that is singularly theirs while uniquely Chicago.\\" NPR Music also had high praise for Howl, stating \\"[the album] goes farther in rejecting the strictures of vintage by-the- booksism by exploring the ways other revivals‚Äîespecially the new wave soul of the 1980s‚Äîhave responded to the genre. At once a confessional break-up album and a critique of the whole concept of telegraphed heartache, Howl is soul with its jacket off. JC Brooks and the Uptown Sound released \\"Rouse Yourself\\" as a single in 2013, and was accompanied by a music video starring Parks & Recreation star Aubrey Plaza and New Girl's Jake Johnson. Another single, \\"You Can't Break Me,\\" was released in 2015, along with a music video filmed in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood during the dead of winter.

Jackson was professor in pediatrics and psychology at the Yale School of Medicine from 1936 to 1959. She directed the Yale Rooming-in Research Project at Grace-New Haven Community Hospital from 1946 to 1953. Upon retiring from Yale, Jackson moved to Colorado, where she directed the Rooming-in Unit at Colorado General Hospital from 1962 to 1970.  Education  Edith Banfield Jackson graduated from Vassar College in 1916 and received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1921. She held medical internships at the State University of Iowa Hospital (where she was the only woman intern)Silberman, Sara Lee. \\"Edith Banfield Jackson\\" in Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century. Ware, Susan, ed. Harvard University Press, 2004. and at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. Jackson traveled to Austria in December 1929 where she underwent training and analysis with Sigmund Freud at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute beginning in 1930. Jackson's analysis with Freud lasted six years.  Maternal and infant care  The impersonal nature of hospital maternity care concerned Jackson. Influenced by her psychiatric training, primarily attachment theory, she worked to eradicate the common practice of separating newborn infants from their mothers and fathers upon birth. \\"Rooming-in\\" allowed newborns to stay in the same hospital room with their mothers, and encouraged parents to care for their infant immediately from birth. In addition, Edith Jackson was a proponent of natural childbirth, breastfeeding, and prenatal instruction. She worked with hospital staff to encourage and develop these policies. Jackson and other hospital staff members wrote a pamphlet called \\"Management of Breast-Feeding\\"; hospitals all over the country used it as a resource. In the decades after Jackson's innovative Rooming-in Project began, her approach to childbirth has become the norm at hospitals across the United States and around the world. Because of her accomplishments, the Edith B. Jackson Childcare Center connected to Yale University is named for her.

From here, they move on to \\"Bjarneyjar\\" (Bear Islands, possibly Disko IslandThe old viking name of Disko Island is indeed Bear Island (Bj√∏rn √òya) Arctic Research in Disko Bay). After two half-days or days of sail with northerly wind they arrive at Helluland (Country of Flat Stones). After another two half-days or days of sail with northerly winds, they arrive at Markland (Forest Country). Off Markland to the South-East is an island that Karlsefni and his company called Bear Island. From Markland, after yet another two half-days or days of sail, they encounter a headland. This headland is possibly identical with Kjalarnes. Keeping the coast on their starboard side, they journey along Furdustrandir (\\"Wonder-strands\\"). Then, the coast becomes indented with creeks. They find grapes and wild wheat, and continue until the shore is cut into by a fjord with an island, Straumsey (Current-isle) at its mouth; this is Straumsfjord. To the south of Straumsfjord is H√≥p, where no snow falls during winter, and on the west side of Kjalarnes is a wilderness, and a river which flows from east to west. East of Kjalarnes is the \\"Irish Ocean\\". Straumsfjord is estimated by Karlsefni to be equidistant from H√≥p and a location north of the river that runs westwards. He also regards H√≥p and this location by the river to share the same mountain [or mountain range]. The \\"two half-days or days\\" [two doegr, which could refer to 12 or 24 hours], referenced three times in the saga, are important to the question of the whereabouts of Straumsfjord because they suggest the distance travelled when Karlsefni and his men, perhaps, crossed open seas.

Available through Google Books. to be equivalent to about 54 to 60 miil. He bases this on old Icelandic sources such as the Landn√°mab√≥k. Miil would refer to either sj√∏mil or to Scandinavian mile. William A. Munn (1929) assumes the two days to correspond to \\"about 200 miles\\".W. A. Munn, \\"Wineland Voyages: Location of Helluland, Markland & Vinland\\" (St John's, NL: Dicks and Company Limited, June 31, 1992), 13. J√≥nas Kristj√°nsson and colleagues, in a 2012 article, suggest that 170 nautical miles, which is the distance between Greenland and Baffin Island, or an even longer distance, could well be transversed over two doegr, as modern replicas of Norse ships have been reported to make 12 knots and more under favourable conditions.Acta Archaeologica vol. 83, 2012, pp 145-177 Geoffrey Malcolm Gathorne-Hardy and William Hovgaard estimated a day of 24 hours' sail at about 150 miles.  Saga of Erik the Red  According to the Saga of Erik the Red, Straumfj√∂r√∞ is located beyond the Wonderstrands (Fur√∞ustrandir). It describes the area thus, according to the \\"fusioned\\" 1880 translation by J. Sephton: Later, after giving up settling farther south due to the presence of hostile Skr√¶lings, Karlsefni and his men again reach Straumsfjord when retreating northwards:  Hallmarks  If the saga's accounts and the translation are accurate, within Straumsfjord, there are mountains, the place was fair to look upon, with large pastures, a harsh winter, and hunting opportunities. A crag or crags are found within some distance. An unknown species of whale shored; it was inedible. On Straumsey, there are so many birds that it is difficult not to step on eggs, it also has poor fishery, but gave good sustenance for their cattle. Fishery failed, but later recovered.  Currents  A defining feature of Straumsfjord and Straumsey must have been high tides or strong currents. The settlement which was established farther south, H√≥p may also have been connected to strong currents or tides, as it has been translated into \\"tidal pool\\" or \\"tidal lake\\". According to a 2008 article by Thomas Hayne in the journal Weather, this may give some clues as to the whereabouts of the fjord:Thomas Hayne, What did the Viking discoverers of America know of the North Atlantic Environment? Weather, Volume 63, Issue 3, pages 60‚Äì65, March 2008.  Climate  Theories on where Straumsfjord and the other places described in the saga were to a large extent based on the saga's descriptions of flora and fauna. The Northern Atlantic has since the saga was written, however, been through periods of natural changes in the regional climate and, more recently, global warming. This adds an extra layer of uncertainty to every climate-dependent observation.  Seamanship  Common sense seamanship implies to avoid open and treacherous seas unless they are unavoidable. Moreover, appropriate natural harbours would be required for the ships. This provides possible constraints to the routes taken.  Skepticism Helge Ingstad and Anne Stine Ingstad (the couple who found L'Anse aux Meadows), in The Viking Discovery of America,1991/2000, Breakwater Books Ltd. take a sceptical approach. They argue that The similarities are also described by Mats G. Larsson.Viking expedition to america - Vikingaf√§rder till Vinland However, according to a 2012 article in Acta Archaeologica, it is \\"now generally accepted\\" that the two sagas were written independently. Fridtjof Nansen, in his I t√•keheimen (In Northern Mists),Full text of \\"In northern mists : Arctic exploration in early times\\" written before the discovery of L'Anse aux Meadows, conjectures that the Saga of Erik the Red was inspired by tales about the Fortunate Isles and, although admitting that it is indeed possible that the Norse reached America, considers the saga to not be trustworthy. Julius E. Olson of the University of Wisconsin strongly attacked this stance in a 1911 article (see also below), saying \\"If there isn't a substantial background of history to the Saga of Eric the Red, it is the most clever piece of literary deception over [sic] practiced in the name of history\\".Julius E. Olson Publications of the Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study , Vol. 1, No. 4 (November, 1913), pp. 147-156 Published by: Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40914910  Suggested locations  The southern tip of Baffin Island, which may have had a warmer climate at the time of the sagas. Nevertheless, is generally agreed that if the sagas are trustworthy, Karlsefni made it past this point. View across the Strait of Belle Isle, from Newfoundland towards Labrador. Chaleur Bay. Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, which is claimed to have the highest tides in the world Manhattan has been suggested as a possible identity for Straumsey The following suggestions for the location of Straumfj√∂r√∞ are gathered from both scholarly and popular literature. They are sorted by increasing distance from the Western Settlement, Greenland: they make increasingly optimistic estimates for the distance travelled by Karlsefni and his company. Evidently, the headland, promontory or cape Kjalarnes is difficult to identify; for seafarers the keel placed there would make its identification obvious, but it is now lost, and Furdustrandir and Straumsfjord lay beyond this point. As will be shown in the following, Kjalarnes is sometimes, but not always, identified as L'Anse aux Meadows, Gasp√© Peninsula, Cape North/Cape Breton and Cape Cod. Many, but not all, of the following suggestions can be placed some distance beyond these points, within four coastal regions: Newfoundland; Chaleur Bay; Nova Scotia/Maine; between Cape Cod and New York.  Ungava Bay  Hayne (2008) connects the extreme tides of Ungava Bay to the alleged currents or tides at Straumsfjord and H√≥p, without drawing any conclusions.  Sandwich Bay  William Hovgaard in The Voyages of the Norsemen to America (1914) takes into account the tales in the Greenland Saga. According to William Stetson Merrill, Hovgaard places Karlsefni's first winter at Sandwich Bay, Labrador. It is not made explicit whether this refers to Straumsfjord.  L'Anse aux Meadows  Birgitta Linderoth Wallace (2003) places the settlement at Straumfj√∂r√∞ at L'Anse aux Meadows.Wallace, B. L., L‚ÄôAnse aux Meadows and Vinland: An Abandoned Experiment. In: L‚ÄôAnse aux Meadows and Vinland: An Abandoned Experiment. James H. Barrett (ed.) Turnhout Brepols Publishers. 2003. (Print) 978-2-503-52641-6 (Online) Pages 207-238  Sop's Arm  J√≥nas Kristj√°nsson et al. (2012) assume that the headland of Kjalarnes referred to in the saga is at L'Anse aux Meadows, suggests that Straumsfjord refers to Sop's Arm, Newfoundland, as no other fjord in Newfoundland was found to have an island at its mouth, and as pitfall traps of possible Norse origin were found at this location.  St. Lawrence  In an 1831 letter sent from Copenhagen to the Massachusetts Historical Society, published in the 1880 Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Rasmus Christian Rask gives a thorough account of the sagas and states, This would refer, it would seem, either to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence or to lower Saint Lawrence River, depending on naming conventions in use at the time. He refuses to propose a theory of the whereabouts of Straumsey, claiming it \\"impossible\\", but hopes for future saga translations to illuminate the issue. H. P. Steensby (da) held that \\"The coast lines were guides for the ancient Norsemen and they must also be ours\\". According to Merrill, Steensby's opinion was that  Baie des Sept- √éles  Cappelen's History of Norway (1976) suggests a location at Baie des Sept-√éles, Quebec.Cappelens Norgeshistorie bd. 2, s. 141. 1976.  Chaleur Bay  An early 1920s book review by Sigf√∫s Bl√∂ndal in Historisk Tidsskrift (Denmark),Historisk Tidsskrift, Bind 9. r√¶kke, 7 (1919 - 1925) 1Historisk Tidsskrift, Bind 9. r√¶kke, 7 (1919 - 1925). Historisk tidskrift. referring to scholarly consensus of the past decades and to the authority of Gustav Storm and H. P. Steensby,H. P. Steensby's \\"Norsemen's Route from Greenland to Wineland\\" places Straumsfjord at Chaleur Bay, which separates Gasp√© Peninsula from New Brunswick. Halld√≥r Hermansson (1930) also placed Straumfjord in Chaleur Bay, \\"where the tide rises from five to ten feet\\". Matthias Thordarsson, who authored The Vinland Voyages (1930), agreed with his views.  Mira Bay  Juul Dieserud (1935) placed Straumsfjord at Mira Bay, Nova Scotia.  Strait of Canso  Geraldine Barnes (1995) connects Straumsfjord to the Strait of Canso between Cape Breton Island and mainland Nova Scotia, due to its high tides and the birdlife at nearby Isle Madame.Geraldine Barnes. \\"V√≠nland the Good: Paradise Lost?\\" Parergon 12.2 (1995): 75-96. Project MUSE. Web. 19 Apr. 2013. . According to a 1935 article by William Stetson Merrill in The Catholic Historical Review, the opinion held by Gustav Storm was as follows:  Lobster Bay  Mats G. Larsson (1992,The Vinland Sagas and Nova Scotia: A Reappraisal of an Old Theory Mats G. Larsson Scandinavian Studies Vol. 64, No. 3 (Summer 1992), pp. 305-335 Published by: Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40919438 1999,Vinland det goda: nordbornas f√§rder till Amerika under vikingatiden MG Larsson - 1999 - Atlantis 2000) considers the Strait of Canso a candidate due to its strong currents, but notes that the currents do not extend to islands. Therefore, he considers Lobster Bay (near the southern tip of Nova Scotia) a better candidate. He notices that Samuel de Champlain named this bay \\"Baye courante (‚ÄôStream Bay‚Äô), i.e. the same name as the Norse one\\". Larsson further observes,  Bay of Fundy  The Bay of Fundy is claimed to have the highest tides in the world.http://www.thehighesttides.com/ Julius E. Olson (1911) pointed out that Fridtjof Nansen, taking a very sceptical stance, was dismissive of the idea of Vinland being located at Nova Scotia, partly because he held that the birdlife there would not match the extreme abundance which the saga describes on Straumsey. Olson points, however, to the Bay of Fundy and the isle of Grand Manan, and quotes Samuel de Champlain's observation of birds on islands by the Nova Scotia coast (in Original Narratives): William Henry Babcock (1935) placed Straumsfjord on the firth leading into Passamaquoddy Bay, referring to the tides around the Bay of Fundy, and also places Straumsey at Grand Manan Island. The Bay of Fundy was also mentioned in a 2008 article in Weather, but without any conclusions being drawn.  Environs of Mount Desert Island  William L. Traxel, in his explorative 2004 book Footprints of the Welsh Indians: Settlers in North America Before 1492 connects Straumsey to Mount Desert Island in Acadia National Park, Maine, United States, and consequently Straumsfjord with one of the nearby inlets:Traxel W.L. Footprints of the Welsh Indians: Settlers in North America Before 1492. 2004 He bases this on an identification of Cape Breton Island as Kjalarnes north of Straumsfjord, and on three candidate locations of H√≥p to the south. Traxel refers to a number of archeological findings by Frederick J. Pohl at Follins Pond,Frederick J. Pohl, The Vikings on Cape Cod: Evidence from an Archaeological Discovery (Pictou Advocate Press, 1957) and connects these to the settlement of H√≥p. He also reports that Robert Ellis Cahill found a Norse longhouse near Buzzard's BayCahill R.E., New England's Ancient Mysteries, 1993, Old Saltbox Publishing Company, 88 p. He also holds Pettaquamscutt River, Rhode Island as a candidate for the location of H√≥p.  Buzzards Bay  According to the 1880 Sephton translation of the saga, Carl Christian Rafn and other Danish scholars placed Kjalarnes at Cape Cod, Straumsfjord at Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts and Straumsey at Martha's Vineyard.The Project Gutenberg eBook of Eirik The Red's Saga:, by The Rev. J. Sephton Rafn suggests these views in a comprehensive treatment in the 1840-1841 Annals for Nordic Ancient Knowledge, observing that the interference of the Gulf Stream by Barnstable would give significant currents in this area. He further identifies H√≥p as Mount Hope Bay, Rhode Island, suggesting that the Norse language name may have survived through \\"the Indians' Mont-Haup\\". He also mentions a nearby Egg Island as a candidate for Straumsey. The suggested connection to Buzzard's Bay is reiterated by Benjamin Franklin DeCosta in The Pre-Columbian Discovery of America by the Northmen (3rd ed., 1901)The pre-Columbian discovery of America : De Costa, Benjamin Franklin, 1831-1904. [from old catalog] : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive The methodology of the account of Edward F. Gray, author of Leif Eriksson: Discoverer of America (1930), appears to be particularly favoured in the 1935 review article by William Stetson Merrill. Considering all Vinland sagas as a whole, Gray suggested that it was not Karlsefni, but Leif Ericson who reached Straumsfjord. The currents of Straumsfjord, Gray holds, relates to the currents of Nantucket Sound, and he proceeded past Martha's Vineyard to build his Leifsbudir at Menemsha Pond.  Long Island Sound  Geoffrey Malcolm Gathorne-Hardy (1921)in The Norse Discoverers of America (Oxford, 1921) https://archive.org/stream/norsediscoverers00gathrich/norsediscoverers00gathrich_djvu.txt argued that Straumfj√∂r√∞ is identical with Long Island Sound, with Straumsey \\"at its eastern extremity\\", i.e. at Fisher's Island. To put this in context, he held Helluland to refer to Labrador and Newfoundland, Markland to refer to Nova Scotia, Kjalarnes to be at Cape Cod.Columbia University Libraries: The iconography of Manhattan Island 1498-1909 (v. 4)Stokes, I. N. Phelps The iconography of Manhattan Island 1498-1909 (v. 4) New York : Robert H. Dodd, 1915-1928 This contradicted earlier estimates. William Paton Ker, in a 1922 book review published in The English Historical Review favoured this view before that of Gustav Storm, who placed Vinland in Nova Scotia.The Norse Discoverers of America, the Wineland Sagas Review Author: W.

A December 1965 article in Folk og Land suggests that the Hudson River is Straumfj√∂r√∞, and that Manhattan Island is Straumsey.SNO Reasons provided are that the name seems apt, that there were excellent natural harbours in this area, such as in the East River and New York Harbor, that this location would be a good base for further exploration, that it is a land of plenty, that the winters on Manhattan Island are relatively cold, and that cliffs, described in the saga, can be found by the Harlem River.

Career   Apprentice  Wheatley was born in Ilkeston, Derbyshire around 1885. From there, he moved to become apprentice at the yard of William Elsey of Baumber, Lincolnshire. His career progressed rapidly and in 1905, while still an apprentice, he won 125 races to earn the title of British flat racing Champion Jockey, setting a new record for wins in a year by an apprentice in the process. He was the last Northern-based jockey to win the title until Kevin Darley won in 2000 and the first apprentice ever to win it.  Professional  On completing his apprenticeship, Elijah went to work at Dobson Peacock's stable in Middleham, Yorkshire where success seemed harder to come by. His seasonal win total began to tail off. In 1908, he only had 25 winners, in 1911 only 17. He did have some success though. In 1913, the last full season before the outbreak of World War I, he won his solitary Classic on Night Hawk in the St Leger and had other big race wins including the Portland Handicap at Doncaster on Hornet's Beauty and in the same year, his win total was back up to 79. During this time he also moved into the heart of British horseracing in Newmarket. An interesting tale about Wheatley is recounted by his fellow jockey, Steve Donoghue. In the 1917 Champion Stakes Donoghue rode Gay Crusader, a horse which needed to be given a lead. Donoghue asked Wheatley, riding Nassovian, whether he might oblige. Wheatley refused, saying he had been given orders by his trainer to wait. All the other jockeys took the same stance, with the result that all four runners stood still at the start. The starter threatened he would report the jockeys to the stewards, they started at a slow canter, then Donoghue had the idea to crack Nassovian on the rear with his whip. Nassovian set off at speed, Gay Crusader tracked him before pulling past and winning comfortably. At the finish, Wheatley was found tending to the gash across his horse's hind quarters. He asked Donoghue, \\"What am I going to say when the trainer sees me?\\". Donoghue quipped back, \\"Tell him you've been promoted to lance-corporal and you've been given your first stripe.\\" After the war, though, Wheatley's career began to falter again. In 1923, he was kept out of action for most of the season through illness and even though he fully recovered and was riding again the following season, the lean spell continued to the point where \\"his past exploits would seem to have been almost forgotten\\" Eventually, Wheatley returned North, where he was once again a big fish in a small pond.  Trainer  Wheatley's next career step took him to Egypt where he spent most of the remainder of his life. In 1933, retired from racing, he was appointed principal trainer to King Fuad. He remained in Egypt until his wife's death in 1951, whereupon he returned home to Ilkeston. He died there in October 1951.  Personal life  Wheatley married twice. His first wife died in the summer of 1912 and shortly after he married actress Maudie Wood, sister of music hall star Marie Lloyd, in Brixton, London.

It aims to allow the children to achieve full participation in their communities through Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and Assistive Technologies (AT). The school was founded by Pegi Young, Jim Forderer and Dr. Marilyn Buzolich in 1986, it has since become a world recognized leader in AAC and AT. History The Bridge School was founded by Pegi Young, Jim Forderer and speech and language pathologist, Dr. Marilyn Buzolich. Pegi Young was inspired to start the school after she was unable to find a suitable school placement for her non-verbal son, Ben Young, who has cerebral palsy. The school opened in 1987 after funds were raised from the 1st Annual Bridge School Benefit concert in 1986. The first student graduated from the school in 1991. A permanent building was constructed for the school on the campus of North Elementary School in 1995 and affords students at the school the opportunity to participate in the general education environment. In 1997, a Teacher in Residence program was established, bringing teachers from countries where the use of AAC and AT is still in its infancy to the school for a year-long placement. This program has since brought teachers from India, Poland, Singapore, Mexico, South Korea and South Africa among other countries. The school opened its preschool program in 2003. Beliefs The school has a transitional model and aims to transition all students back to their home districts and is not intended to be a permanent school placement. One of its core beliefs is that educators, families and students must all work collaboratively to allow learning to be effective and families of the students are heavily involved in learning, students are also encouraged to actively participate in their own learning. The school uses technology as a tool for learning and believes that everyone who requires it should have access to a 'holistic communication system'. The use of multi-modal communication is encouraged, encompassing vocalisations, body language, eye contact and gestures as well AAC and AT. The main purpose of the program is to provide children with an effective means of communication and allow children to express themselves. The school employs special education teachers, speech and language pathologists, assistive technologists and instructional assistants. Benefit Concert One of the organization's main sources of funding is the annual benefit concert which is held every October at Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View (CA). It is an acoustic non-profit charity concert organized by Neil Young and his wife Pegi Young (Bridge School founder). The first concert was held in 1986 to support the opening of the school and has been held every year, with the exception of 1987, since. In 2012 the 26th concert was held. Performers generally perform acoustically. Past artists have included Phish, Thom Yorke, Green Day, The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, David Bowie, Metallica, Elton John, Foo Fighters, Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys, Mumford & Sons, Florence Welch, and Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. Neil Young is heavily involved in the organization and promotion of the concert and performs every year. In 2011, a critically acclaimed CD and DVD compilation containing highlights from the concerts was released to commemorate the organizations' 25th Anniversary. There have also been numerous iTunes collections released to raise funds for the school. Programs Education Education for individuals with complex speech and physical needs is the main purpose of the organization and both school and pre-school programs are run. The pre-school caters for students aged 3 to 6 years old and the school program caters for students aged 6 to 14 years. Two classrooms allow for up to 14 students. Strategies for dealing with language and communication needs are emphasised within the curriculum alongside standard state curriculum guidelines. Research In 2001 the Board of Directors established a Research program to examine their educational practices and understand the impact and effect they have on their students. This research aims to allow the organization to enhance future educational practice at the school as well as share the information they have with the field of AAC and AT worldwide. Transition A transitional program was developed to aid the transition of students from the Bridge School back to their home schooling districts. It provides support to the students, families and professionals working with the student and aims to ensure all communication strategies are easily used in the student's new setting. It documents the student's individual education and communication needs and helps develop strategies for effective transition. Tools have been developed by the organization to assist the students and their families. Outreach The organization's outreach program allows information gathered at the school through research and experience to be shared with parents, professionals and AAC/AT users internationally. It aims to promote inclusion of AAC/AT users and positively effect the futures of these individuals worldwide. An 'AAC by the Bay' Conference is held every two years to allow international leaders in the field of AAC and AT to gather and share information. Several documents detailing 'Classroom Strategies' for individuals with complex communication needs have been published by the organization to disseminate the knowledge the school has gathered. The organization also holds lectures and provides opportunities for individuals to have hands-on experience with modern assistive technologies and training programs. The Teacher in Residence program also contributes to the organization's outreach. =Bridge Communities Through Alternative Communications (BCTAC) program= This program provides opportunities for teenagers and young people who use AAC and AT to gather, share ideas and raise awareness of AAC/AT users. The group caters for individuals aged 15 and older and meets monthly. Members plan and hold events, talks and retreats. Some of the program's main goals are to allow opportunity for connection between individuals locally and globally and encourage independence, self-advocacy and self-determination. The use of technology and the Internet is also encouraged in this program. =Building Bridges Training Camp and Institute= The organization holds a yearly summer camp for AAC/AT users, their siblings and people wishing to work with these individuals. The camp is held in Camp Harmon in Santa Cruz Mountains, CA and lasts approximately one week. An opportunity for individuals to train in the use of AAC/AT is available. =Bridge School News Network (BSNN)= The organization has a YouTube channel with hundreds of subscribers which features broadcasts from the students. These broadcasts consist of news from the school as well as students interviewing artists performing at the benefit concert.

Career and published work  In 1996 McCormack had his first work published in the Irish outdoor magazine Walking World Ireland. Since then his images have appeared in many major publications including National Geographic, Time and Cond√© Nast. His images have also been used in advertising by Air New Zealand, Tourism Ireland and American Express. In 2010 he undertook a major commission from the Office of Public Works in Ireland to provide mural-sized imagery for the visitors centre at Ballycroy National Park. Since 2011 he has been a member of the environmental organization One Percent for the Planet.http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/en/search/member_profile_page.php?id=2266  Style and influences  McCormack drew early inspiration from the work of Galen Rowell, including the pursuit of imagery in remote locations using lightweight photographic equipment. His own style is still heavily influenced by Rowell's signature approach of combining dynamic landforms with vivid natural light.  Video work  McCormack has worked in video since 2010, in particular with HDSLRs such as the Canon 5D Mk2 and point of view devices such as the GoPro Hero. His video has been used by Tourism Ireland. Some of his landscape and timelapse footage will also be used in the RT√â documentary The Island Landscape to be aired in April 2013.  Other work  McCormack is also a writer on walking and adventure travel. He has been a regular contributor to the Irish outdoor magazine Walking World Ireland since 1997. He is author and co-author of several walking guides published by Lonely Planet and Rucsac Readers.

When a plane wave propagates through a homogeneous viscoelastic medium, the effects of amplitude attenuation and velocity dispersion may be combined conveniently into a single dimensionless parameter, Q, the medium-quality factor. Transmission losses may occur due to friction or fluid movement, and whatever the physical mechanism, they can be conveniently described with an empirical formulation where elastic moduli and propagation velocity are complex functions of frequency.

Buchanan came to Central Africa as an ambitious artisan: his character was described as dour and devout but also as restlessly ambitious, and he saw in Central Africa a gateway to personal achievement.J McCracken, (2008). Politics and Christianity in Malawi, p. 64. He started a mission farm on the site of Zomba, Malawi but was dismissed from the mission in 1881 for brutality. From being a disgraced missionary, Buchanan first became a very influential planter owning, with his brothers, extensive estates in Zomba District. He then achieved the highest position he could in the British administration as Acting British Consul to Central Africa from 1887 to 1891. In that capacity declared a protectorate over the Shire Highlands in 1889 to pre-empt a Portuguese expedition that intended to claim sovereignty over that region. In 1891, the Shire Highlands became part of the British Central Africa Protectorate.

Family Background John Buchanan was born in Muthill, Perthshire on 15 May 1855. His father, John Buchanan, was a skilled worker at Drummond Castle who married Helen (n√©e Gilbert) in 1844; they had six known children: Duncan (b. 1851), Mary (b. 1853), John (b. 1855), David (b. 1858), Christina (b. 1860) and Robert (b. 1862).

He was one of the original party under the leadership of Henry Henderson that founded the Church of Scotland Blantyre Mission. This mission was founded 15 years before a British protectorate was declared over the whole country.Biography in JSTOR Plant Science http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000036911K Stahl, (2010). Some Notes on the Development of Zomba, p. 39. Background to the Mission The Scottish missions in Central Africa owed their origin to the activities of David Livingstone, who first explored the area in 1858-9 and described it as a suitable field for missionary enterprise and European settlement. However, his optimistic assessment was overtaken by a major famine in 1861-2, by the expansion of the Yao, who displaced existing inhabitants, and by war and slave raiding, all of which severely disrupted what Livingstone had described as a near-idyllic society. Livingstone was himself at least partly responsible for some of this disruption as, on his Zambezi expedition, he brought with him from Barotseland a number of porters who are usually described as Makololo, and left them near Chikwawa on the Shire River in 1864 when the expedition ended. These men had firearms, and they soon attracted dependents and formed several small chieftaincies along the Shire River.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 37‚Äì41. In the middle of the 19th century, there were several major population movements in Central Africa. One was the Yao migration into what became Nyasaland. The Yao people originally lived south of the Ruvuma River in what is now Mozambique, from where successive Yao groups moved to settle west of Lake Chiuta. The leaders of two major divisions of the Yao there were Malemia and Kawinga: these fought against one another and also against the Ngoni or Angoni, another migrant group.J C Mitchell, (1951). An Outline of the Social Structure of Malemia Area, p. 21. The Ngoni left South Africa in the 1820s under their leader Zwangendaba as part of the great migration called the mfecane, caused at least in part by rise of the Zulu Kingdom. Four Ngoni groups settled in parts of what today is Malawi in the 1850s, and expanded by raiding their neighbours and forcibly incorporating captives into their communities.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 29‚Äì30. In the period after 1860, many people in what is now southern Malawi suffered insecurity because of warfare and slave raiding: this led to the widespread abandonment fertile land. Local chiefs tried to gain protection from European settlers who entered the area by granting them the right to cultivate vacant land, without intending to cede its ownership permanently.B. Pachai, (1978). Land and Politics in Malawi, 1875‚Äì1975, p. 36. One example of this process was when the Rev. Duff MacDonald and John Buchanan, both of Blantyre Mission, met Malemia in August 1879 to request land for a farming outstation of the mission on the Mulunguzi River. The site of this mission station was later occupied by the Government headquarters in Zomba, the colonial capital of Nyasaland. The mission station itself moved to Domasi at the end of the 19th century.J C Mitchell, (1951). An Outline of the Social Structure of Malemia Area, pp. 25‚Äì6.K Stahl, (2010). Some Notes on the Development of Zomba, pp. 39‚Äì40. From 1878 until 1880, Buchanan worked as an agriculturalist for the mission at Zomba as well as at Blantyre, assisted by a small staff of Africans. He received permission from Malemia to plant coffee seedlings imported from the botanical garden at Edinburgh at Zomba.J. Watson, (1973). Some Notes on the History of the Zomba District, The Society of Malawi Journal, Vol. 26, No. 1 p. 51. The Blantyre Atrocities In the late 1870s, Blantyre Mission and its outstation were poorly organised. Duff Macdonald, the leading clergyman after 1878, refused to become involved in its daily administration and control was largely exercised by Dr Thomas Macklin and three artisans: John Buchanan (who divided his time between Blantyre and Zomba), John Walker and George Fenwick. An increasing number of robberies at the mission led to arbitrary violence against suspected thieves, which was later called the \\"Blantyre atrocities\\". Corporal punishment involved up to 200 lashes from a buffalo hide whip, sometimes with little evidence of wrongdoing. In February and March 1879, one man died after a severe flogging for having thrown away a chest of tea he was ordered to carry and another, accused of murder, was killed in a botched execution by a firing-squad.J McCracken, (2011). Class, Violence and Gender in Early Colonial Malawi, pp. 3‚Äì4. Although a small minority within the Church of Scotland attempted to defend Blantyre Mission's actions on the grounds that there was no civil authority to protect it, the prevailing view was that the mission had no legal or moral right to inflict these punishments. However, it was only after the publication of a pamphlet exposing these outrages in early 1880 that the Church's Foreign Mission Committee sent the Rev. James Rankin to Blantyre to investigate charges of inhuman treatment of Africans there. Lord Granville, the Foreign Secretary appointed Alexander Pringle, a lawyer, to accompany Rankin on behalf of the British government. Rankin and Pringle took depositions at Blantyre in September 1880, which Rankin used to prepared a report on the Blantyre cases. This was considered in March 1881 by the Foreign Mission Committee, which concluded that the Rev. Macdonald should be removed for failure to supervise Buchanan and Fenwick, the two workers deemed most responsible for the two deaths and illegal floggings, and that Buchanan and Fenwick should be summarily dismissed.J McCracken, (2008). Politics and Christianity in Malawi 1875‚Äì1940, pp. 98‚Äì9.The James Rankin Collection, (1880‚Äì81) Special Collections, University of Virginia Library http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva-sc/viu03801.xml Landowning By the time he was dismissed by the mission in 1881, Buchanan had exchanged guns, calico, and some low-value trade goods for a total of 167,823 acres of land in the Shire Highlands. His land deals were dubious, as the agreements were signed by chiefs who had no understanding of English concepts of land tenure. This land was acquired in the name of Buchanan Brothers, a partnership of John and his two younger brothers, David and Robert, who joined him in Central Africa in 1881. These land deals were probably made in the expectation that, when more settlers arrived, land prices would rise and some of the land the brothers held could be profitably sold. Buchanan also acted as broker for non-residents wishing to buy land, including Alexander Low Bruce, whose land later formed the A L Bruce Estates.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 49‚Äì50, 77-8. After the establishment of the British Central Africa Protectorate, the Buchanan Brothers' claims were recognised by the colonial administration, which issued Certificates of Claim (in effect the registration of freehold title) for all the separate areas of land they had acquired.B. Pachai, (1973). Land Policies in Malawi: An Examination of the Colonial Legacy, pp. 682‚Äì3, 685. The Buchanan Brothers, led by John, experimented with a number of crops, starting with coffee, sugar-cane and tea at Zomba in the early 1890s and they built a sugar mill to produce sugar for the local market.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 77.F M Withers, (1949). Nyasaland in 1895‚Äì96, pp. 22‚Äì3. Buchanan himself described progress in coffee planting as slow before the declaration of the protectorate, but he began exporting in 1891, and in 1892‚Äì93 about ten million coffee seedlings were planted in the Shire Highlands. The first coffee grown was Coffea arabica but Blue Mountain coffee was also found to be suitable at the heights of about 3,000 feet usual in the highlands.J Buchanan, (1893). The Industrial Development of Nyasaland, p. 252. Cultivating coffee as a major crop in Central Africa had a short and disappointing history. In 1896 there were over 10,000 acres under coffee in the Protectorate and 160 tons were exported, gaining high prices in London in 1896 and 1897. However, this coincided with a period of sustained coffee development in Brazil which lowered coffee prices on the world market, and the Nyasaland coffee industry never recovered from this.C. A. Baker (1962) Nyasaland, The History of its Export Trade, p. 10. In early 1890s, Buchanan introduced Virginia-type tobacco. This became the favoured estate crop in drier areas of the Shire Highlands after the failure of coffee, but tobacco growing only developed significantly after the opening of a railway in 1908 to export the crop.J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 176‚Äì8, 183.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 91. John Buchanan was instrumental in the formation of the Nyasaland Planters Association, which mainly represented the interests of Buchanan Brothers and the African Lakes Company. In 1895, this fused with a rival association to form the British Central Africa Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, a powerful lobby group for settler interests. John Buchanan was the first Chairman, until his sudden death early in 1896, when he was succeeded by his brother Robert, who died a few months later.F M Withers, (1949). Nyasaland in 1895‚Äì96, p. 22. Administrative career Britain had maintained consuls on the Island of Mozambique since 1856, mainly to monitor and combat the slave trade. Two of these Mozambique-based consuls, Elton in 1877 and O'Neill in 1882, visited the European missions and settlements in the Shire Highlands. O'Neill's visit was made in the aftermath of the Blantyre atrocities, and he recommended that a consul should be appointed for the Lake Nyasa area.M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, London, Hurst & Co pp. 324‚Äì5. The first consul to \\"the Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa in the territories adjacent to Lake Nyasa\\", Captain Foot, was appointed in 1883. Foot used Blantyre, where a settlement had begun to grow around the Blantyre Mission, as his headquarters. His successor, Captain Hawes, set up his headquarters at Zomba in 1886, partly because if its nearness to the major slave route running south from Lake Nyasa to the coast, and partly because he disliked the settlers and missionaries of Blantyre.B. Pachai, (1971). The Story of Malawi's Capitals: Old and New: 1891‚Äì1969, The Society of Malawi Journal, Vol. 24, No. 1 p.35. In 1887, the Buchanan Brothers completed a new consulate building on the slopes of Zomba Mountain, near the Mlunguzi stream, for Captain Hawes. This house was later occupied by the early governors of Nyasaland and was known as the Residency. Karonga War The African Lakes Company was established in 1877 as a trading and transport concern to work in close cooperation with the Scottish missions around Lake Nyasa, combating the slave trade by introducing legitimate trade and developing European influence in the area.J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, p. 77. In 1883, the company opened a depot at Karonga at the north end of Lake Nyasa to exchange ivory gathered by Swahili traders for trade goodsJ McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966 p. 49 Initially, relations between the company and the Swahili traders were cordial, but later deteriorated, partly because of the company‚Äôs delays in providing guns, ammunition and other trade goods to pay for the ivory it bought on credit, and also because the Swahili traders turned more to slaving than obtaining ivoryJ McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966 pp. 51-2. The Swahili traders were forced to wait several months for payment, and they, their workers and guards expected the local Ngonde people to supply them with food, which led to quarrels and eventually to attacks on the Ngonde communities that the company had promised to protect L M Fotheringham, (1891). Adventures in Nyasaland, pp. London, Gilbert & Rivington pp. 34-7. The Ngonde claimed the protection of the African Lakes Company: this was initially refused but, after fighting in which the Ngonde were defeated and their paramount chief‚Äôs village was sacked, many fled to Karonga. Fotheringham, the company's agent at Karonga, claimed that the Swahili wished to drive the Ngonde from their homeland and also intended to attack Karonga, so he strengthened its defences and issued arms, engaging in open warfare against them L M Fotheringham, (1891). pp. 51, 61-3J McCraken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966 p. 52. Fotheringham appealed for assistance, and the British Consul at Mozambique, O'Neill, whose was outside his area of consular authority, acted on behalf of Hawes, the Consul to the Lake Region, who was absent, by providing armed support for the company. On the return of Consul Hawes from leave, there was a dispute between the two consuls. Hawes wished to discontinue the armed conflict while O'Neill wanted to resume the offensive. O'Neill returned to Mozambique, but Hawes also quarrelled with the African Lakes Company representative, who was supported by most of the European settlers. When hostilities continued in 1887 against his advice, Hawes felt obliged to leave the area although he retained the post of Consul until 1889, and he was later reassigned to Zanzibar. Before Hawes left at the end of 1887, he appointed John Buchanan as Acting Consul. Buchanan remained in this post until the new Consul, Johnson, arrived in 1889, when he became Johnson's assistant P. T. Terry, (1965). The Arab War on Lake Nyasa 1887‚Äì1895, The Nyasaland Journal, Vol. 18, No. 1, pp. 58, 62-3. Buchanan attempted to negotiate a peaceful settlement with the Arabs in March 1888, but without success. He later refused to authorise Captain Frederick Lugard, who was visiting the area in a hunting trip, to lead a further expedition against them, because this was against the instructions that Hawes had left. Despite Buchanan's refusal to give the expedition official backing, he did not oppose the African Lakes Company, supported by most of the European settlers and the Scottish missionaries, organising a force led by Lugard, which attacked the Arabs at Karonga from May 1888 onwards.P. T. Terry, (1965). The Arab War on Lake Nyasa 1887‚Äì1895, pp. 65‚Äì70, 75-6 After the arrival of Johnson, who made a treaty with the Swahili to end the conflict in October 1889, he sent his assistant, Buchanan, to Karonga in March 1891 to monitor how its terms were being observed. Buchanan reported to Johnston that the Ngonde were still being driven out, and the Swahili traders were building more fortified villages and restricting the African Lakes Company‚Äôs activitiesJ McCraken, (2012).

Although Johnson was fully engaged in the south at that time, in 1895 he led a military expedition that led to the destruction of the fortifications and allowing the Ngonde people to return to their home villagesJ McCraken, (2012).

Establishing the Protectorate Although Portugal claimed much of Central Africa on the basis of early exploration, its attempts to negotiate British acceptance of these claims failed. The Portuguese government occupied the lower Shire River valley as far as the Ruo River in 1882, but Britain declined to accept a Portuguese claim that the Shire Highlands should also be treated as part of Portuguese East Africa as it was not under their effective occupation.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 51.F Axelson, (1967). Portugal and the Scramble for Africa, pp. 182‚Äì3, 198‚Äì200. Johannesburg, Witwatersrand University Press. In 1888, the Portuguese government instructed its representatives in Portuguese East Africa to make treaties of protection with the Yao chiefs southeast of Lake Nyasa and in the Shire Highlands. Two expeditions, one under Antonio Cardosa, a former governor of Quelimane, the second led by Alexandre de Serpa Pinto, the governor of Mozambique set off at the end of 1888. Between them, these two expeditions made over twenty treaties with chiefs in what is now Malawi.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 52‚Äì3. To prevent effective Portuguese occupation of the Shire Highlands, the British government appointed Henry Hamilton Johnston as British consul to Mozambique and the Interior in early 1889, and instructed him to report on the extent of Portuguese rule in the Zambezi and Shire valleys and to make conditional treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction, to prevent them from accepting protection from Portugal.J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 83‚Äì4. The Makololo who had remained on the Shire north and west of the Ruo River when Livingstone's Zambezi expedition ended and formed chieftaincies there claimed to be outside Portuguese control. Serpa Pinto's expedition was, in part, a response to a request from the Portuguese resident on the lower Shire for assistance in dealing with disturbances he claimed were caused by the Makololo.M Newitt,(1995). A History of Mozambique, London, Hurst & Co p. 282. . Johnston arrived on the lower Shire River on his way to Blantyre in August 1889. He found Serpa Pinto camped east of the Ruo River in acknowledged Portuguese territory and advised him not to cross the river into the Shire Highlands.J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 85‚Äì6. When Johnston arrived in the Shire Highlands, Buchanan's post acting for Consul Hawes lapsed. However, Johnston found Buchanan indispensable in the early stages of the administration, particularly as a link with the settlers. Buchanan remained as Vice-Consul and, when Johnston was absent from his headquarters at Zomba, Buchanan was Acting Consul in his place.K Stahl, (2010). Some Notes on the Development of Zomba, p. 43. While he was acting for the absent Johnston, the Makololo asked Buchanan for British assistance, and in his role as Vice-Consul, he accused Portugal of ignoring British interests in this area and formally declared the Makokolo to be under a British protection on 21 September 1889, although this was contrary to his instructions to do no more than prevent local rulers accepting protection from another state.M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, p. 346.F. M. Withers, (1951). Nyasaland's Diamond Jubilee, p. 9. The Portuguese claims to the Shire Highlands were opposed both by the African Lakes Company and the missionaries. It is likely that members of the British community there encouraged the Makololo to attack Serpa Pinto's camp, which led to a minor battle between Pinto's Portuguese troops and the Makololo on 8 November 1889 near the Shire River. Although Serpa Pinto had previously acted with caution, he then crossed the Ruo and occupied much of Makololo territory.M Newitt, (1995). History of Mozambique, pp. 346‚Äì7. Following this Johnston proclaimed a further protectorate over the districts west of Lake Nyasa. This was contrary to his instructions from the British government, but was endorsed by the Foreign Office in May 1891.R I Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa: The Making of Malawi and Zambia, 1873‚Äì1964, p.15. Buchanan was made a Companion of Saint Michael and Saint George (C.M.G.) in 1890 for his services as consul.Obituary of John Buchanan, C M G.(1896), p. 79. Protectorate Administration Between the British issuing of an Ultimatum to Portugal on 11 January 1890 and the signing of a treaty in Lisbon on 11 June 1891, both Britain and Portugal tried to occupy more of the disputed areas and assert their authority. Buchanan asserted British sovereignty on the Shire Highlands by executing two Portuguese cipais (African soldiers), claiming they were within British jurisdiction.M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, p. 354. In this period, Johnston began to establish his administration. He had decided to make no appointments before he arrived in Nyasaland, as he believed he would find men there with knowledge of the country and its people, and who were physically and mentally tough. In 1890, he appointed eight political officers, officially entitled \\"Collectors of Revenue\\" including John Buchanan, who was also Vice-Consul.C. A. Baker, (1988). The Genesis of the Nyasaland Civil Service, pp. 38‚Äì9. In 1891, Johnston appointed Alfred Sharpe as Vice- Consul in place of Buchanan. Sharpe, who was a solicitor and had acted as a magistrate in Fiji between 1885 and 1886, had come to Central Africa as an elephant hunter and ivory trader in 1887, but had become involved in the African Lakes Company's war against the Arab slave traders. Sharpe had not been appointed as a political officer in 1890, because he was on a mission for Cecil Rhodes to Katanga, but on his return, Johnston chose him over Buchanan on account of his legal training, activity and because, unlike Buchanan, he had no estate to run.R. B. Boeder, (1979) Sir Alfred Sharpe and The Imposition of Colonial Rule On The Northern Ngoni, pp. 23‚Äì4. Legacy At the time of his death, Buchanan was on his way to Europe, but died in March 1896 at Chinde, a port at the mouth of the Zambezi, of a severe fever contracted during the journey down the Zambezi river. David Buchanan had predeceased him in 1892 and Robert died later in 1896. After the deaths of all three Buchanan brothers, a Buchanan Brothers Company was formed to take over assets of their former partnership, and this company was run by a local manager until 1901. Although there were other family members, none were resident in British Central Africa or involved in the business.F M Withers, (1949). Nyasaland in 1895‚Äì96, p. 23.W H J Rangeley, (1957) A Brief History of the Tobacco Industry in Nyasaland (Part I), p. 67. John William Moir (1851‚Äì1940) was recruited in 1878 as one of the first managers of the African Lakes Company. After he went on leave in March 1890, he was not re-appointed as by the company as its manager. He returned to British Central Africa in 1893, and became a pioneer tea planter.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/94727?&docPos;=47&backToResults;= Robert Spence Hynde originally came to Nyasaland in 1888 as a Church of Scotland lay missionary, but soon became a planter.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 167 In 1898, John Moir and Robert Hynde incorporated Blantyre and East Africa Ltd, a company registered in Scotland, which in 1901 acquired the estates of the Buchanan Brothers Company.W. H. J. Rangeley (1958). The Origins of the Principal Street Names of Blantyre and Limbe, pp. 41‚Äì2, 54. The main activity of Blantyre and East Africa Ltd was the ownership of estates and its main crops were tobacco and tea. Blantyre and East Africa Ltd was one of four large estate-owning companies in colonial Nyasaland.B Pachai, (1978). Land and Politics in Malawi 1875‚Äì1975, pp. 37‚Äì40.

Higher water levels were reached than during the devastating North Sea flood of 1953 from North Shields to King's Lynn, but values were lower towards the Thames. Locally severe flooding occurred in Lincolnshire, The Wash, north Norfolk and Kent. Improvements in flood protection following the devastating flood of 1953 meant that the catastrophic losses seen during that storm were not repeated. The storm caused severe damage to many piers along the east coast of England. Meteorological history Warnings and preparation Flood warnings were issued two to three hours before the highest water levels in the coastal towns of Lincolnshire. Clement Freud the Member of Parliament for North East Cambridgeshire called for an inquiry into the failure of the flood warnings in East Anglia. The Junior Minister Shirley Summerskill reported that an \\"Alert\\" message was received by Police in Wisbech at 0705 hours and a further message at 1414 hours confirming that there was danger of tidal flooding at 1928 hours. On receipt of the second message, the Fenland District Council was notified immediately. The message was passed simultaneously to the Anglian Water Authority by the Cambridgeshire Constabulary headquarters. Gavin Strang of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food responded that the storm tide warning service issued an alert to the Norfolk Police at 0625 hours and a warning at 1318 hours on 11 January in relation to the Norfolk coast as far east as Mundesley. An alert for the coastal area to the East and South of Mundesley was issued at 1150 hours and a warning at 1810 hours. The police are responsible for passing on these messages to other authorities. Impact Humberside and Lincolnshire In Humberside a police car was swept away by the rising waters at Spurn Point. In Cleethorpes a total of 1,500 houses were affected by flooding during the event. 1,017 houses were flooded above floor level, a further 185 houses were flooded below floor level and 288 houses had their gardens flooded. It was estimated that ¬£1,600,000 (1978) worth of damage was caused to private property and goods in Cleethorpes. One of the big differences between 1978 and the storm surge during the Gale of January 1976 in the town, was that damage occurred much further inland. Damage was reported up to three-quarters of a mile away from the sea wall. In Cleethorpes the damage spread over an area of in total. The railway between Grimsby and Cleethorpes was left inoperable as the ballast was washed out from under the track. Further south on the Lincolnshire coast the resorts of Sandilands and Mablethorpe saw 28 homes and 8 business premises left underwater, with caravans and chalets along the Lincolnshire coast damaged. In Boston, Lincolnshire following the failure of a brick retaining wall, St Botolph's Church and 180 houses were flooded. Waters in the church exceeded the levels seen in 1953. In Sutton Bridge Wharf Street and Customhouse Street flooded as water overflowed the banks of the River Nene. East Anglia St Margaret's Church, King's Lynn that denote the extraordinary height to which flood water rose at certain times in history, the highest being in 1978, which was due to a North Sea surge Extensive flooding was reported in Wisbech, including the Clarkson Geriatric Day Hospital, which had to be closed for weeks as repairs were made (the hospital closed permanently in 1983). A 70-year-old woman was reported drowned in her flooded home in Wisbech after the Nene burst its banks forcing 1000 people to evacuate their homes. Staff at the Wisbech Standard, having been warned of a potential flood, went to the town's bridge and saw the waters rise, then recede, thinking the town had narrowly escaped they returned home, not realising until the morning that the town's north ward had flooded. King's Lynn suffered worse flooding in 1978 than in the storm of 1953. The Ouse overflowed onto the Quays, King Street and the town's medieval quarter. The town centre was left underwater causing damage totalling millions of pounds. 1978 flood level recorded in St Margaret's church in the town were at 1190mm. The costs of damage in King's Lynn though were less than during 1953 flood. The storm surge breached the shingle ridge to the south of Heacham and the sea wall at Heacham North Beach, resulting in significant damage to property. Hundreds of caravans near to Snettisham and Hunstanton were overturned by the storm. With damage to caravans also occurring in Wolferton. In Wells-next-the-Sea two major breaches occurred, flooding the adjacent marshes, damaging beach huts and grounding a 300-ton coaster on Wells quay car park. The storm washed away over ¬Ω mile (800 m) of track of the Wells Harbour Railway. Severe flooding was reported at Walcott. Though no major flooding was reported in Great Yarmouth. Along the coast in Suffolk, Lowestoft reported no major flooding, but noted increased erosion of cliffs around Benacre, Suffolk and Covehithe during the event. In Southwold the pavilion and some beach huts along the esplanade were damaged. 25 properties flooded in Aldeburgh and 40 properties were reported as flooded in Felixstowe. Major storm damage to the hamlet of Felixstowe Ferry was reported, with cars destroyed, boats stranded and houseboats damaged. with the next high tide due at 2.30 there were fears that the promenade and homes could flood, a full-scale emergency response was put into action, filling sandbags to stop the flood entering homes on the sea front. In Essex, Harwich and Dovercourt saw parts of the town quay and approach roads flooded. South Essex was sheltered from the main force of wind, with some breaches in rural locations, but compared to 1953 damages were light. London In East London no major damage was experienced, the steel and rubber floodgates designed to protect the major London docks were closed for the first time since their completion in 1972. Dikes reinforced 4 years previously prevented flooding in London, Flood waters rose 5 inches above the previous defences. with sea levels being half a metre below the new defence levels. Kent Coastal flooding at Littlestone Golf Club, St Mary's Bay, Kent 1978 The 1978 storm surge was estimated to be a 1 in 20 year event in Kent. The Isle of Sheppey saw extensive damage, with the island cut off from the mainland by flooding and snow. At Shellness Hamlet around 400 ha of land was flooded to a depth of 1.5m. Serious disruption due to flooding also occurred in Sheerness. In the Swale district of Kent the tidal defences along the western marshes (Barksore, Chetney and Horsham) were overtopped, along with the defences north of Faversham. In addition the tidal defences around the Isle of Harty were breached resulting in flooding around the Isle. The sea defences were breached east of The Lilies (NE of Sittingbourne) with flooding occurring along Conyer Creek. Flooding also occurred further up Faversham Creek, but this was considered to be fluvial. No residential or business property was reported as being flooded. The storm brought considerable damage to the Seaview Caravan and Chalet Park in Swalecliffe due to overtopping of the sea defences. There was also damage from overtopping of flood defences at Pegwell Bay, between Ramsgate and Sandwich on the east coast of Kent. Flooding was also reported to the northwest and southeast of Sandwich, Kent. Families were evacuated by boat from Deal, Kent. Coastal flooding continued around the Kent coast into the English Channel with water coming over the top of sea defences at St Mary's Bay, Kent on Romney Marsh. East coast pier damage Cleethorpes Pier saw 150 disabled people and pensioners stranded in the town's pier, which withstood the waves largely without significant damage. In Skegness the storm washed away two large sections of the pier and left the theatre isolated at the seaward end. Plans to link the two sections by monorail, and to build a new 1200 seat theatre and a 250-foot tower all fell through later that year when an application for financial assistance was rejected. In Hunstanton most of the pier was destroyed by the storm, with a small section at the end removed by the council some weeks later. The shoreward end amusement arcade survived, along with one set of piles. The iron legs of Hunstanton pier were found later washed up 8 km to the south. The Southwold Pier was damaged. Herne Bay Pier saw the main deck destroyed leaving only a short section intact and the pier-head isolated out at sea. Margate jetty (to distinguish from stone harbour walls) which had been closed since 1976 because of safety issues was virtually destroyed by the 11 January 1978 storm surge isolating the lifeboat station. Following the storm the RAF air sea rescue Wessex helicopter from Manston, landed some of the lifeboat crew onto the station and after checking for damage to the lifeboat slipway, the boat was launched and taken to Ramsgate.

Like the previous year's Zeeland, Goldregen takes the form of a series of spontaneous jams, quickly recorded and mastered. Unlike Zeeland, Goldregen is entirely acoustic, containing only piano, violin, harmonium, drums and vocals. Unlike most other albums released by Klaus Dinger it is quiet and meditative rather than aggressive or abrasive; its low key and low-fi values arguable align it with ambient music. Background and recording The album title is a play on words. The cover painting depicts a laburnum plant, which in German is called goldregen. Klaus Dinger's grand piano was made by a company called \\"Goldregen\\".see the song \\"Arms Control Blues\\" from Dinger's album Blue Recording began on 2 May 1998 at Klaus Dinger's studio in D√ºsseldorf, starting with the album's opener \\"Zeeland Wunderbar\\"; the only track to have been written before sessions began. It features Klaus Dinger's mother Renate on vocals and is a light-hearted, humorous track about life in Zeeland. On 27 May, Klaus and Victoria Wehrmeister convened in Dinger's Dutch studio to create three harmonium based tracks (which close the album), whilst Rembrandt Lensink and Thomas Dinger finalised \\"Zeeland Wunderbar\\" in D√ºsseldorf. Four days later the whole band met up in D√ºsseldorf to record tracks 2-9. Goldregen was the first musical collaboration between the Dinger brothers since 1983; a product of their 1997 reunion following a long and bitter legal battle over the rights to La D√ºsseldorf. Klaus described Goldregen as a \\"family album\\". Despite this he also expressed regret that Andreas Reihse had not been able to join the sessions (due to commitments with Kreidler). Klaus cited his musical influences for the record as including John Cale's Music for a New Society, the \\"almost sacred atmosphere\\" of that album being something he consciously tried to recreate on Goldregen.

Modified from figure by . Grays River Volcanics and later parts of the Tillamook Volcanics are now considered post-Siletzian. Siletzia is a massive formation of early to middle Eocene epoch marine basalts and interbedded sediments in the forearc of the Cascadia subduction zone, on the west coast of North America. It forms the basement rock under western Oregon and Washington and the southern tip of Vancouver Island.; ; ; . It is now fragmented into the Siletz and Crescent terranes.. The portion of Siletzia under Oregon and southeastern Washington, leaving out the Olympic Peninsula and Vancouver Island, has also been called the Willamette Plate. , and see fig. 11, p. 3772. Siletzia corresponds geographically to the Coast Range Volcanic Province (or Coast Range basalts),. but is distinguished from slightly younger basalts that erupted after Siletzia accreted to the continent and differ in chemical composition.. The Siletzia basalts are tholeiitic, a characteristic of mantle-derived magma erupted from a spreading ridge between plates of oceanic crust. The younger basalts are alkalic or calc-alkaline, characteristic of magmas derived from a subduction zone.; . This change of composition reflects a change from marine to continental volcanism that becomes evident around 48 to 42 Ma (millions of years ago), and is attributed to the accretion of Siletzia against the North American continent.. Authors have differed as to which formations are Siletzian. For a recent categorization see . Various theories have been proposed to account for the volume and diversity of Siletzian magmatism, as well as the approximately 75¬∞ of rotation, but the evidence is insufficient to determine Siletzia's origin; the question remains open.; . The accretion of Siletzia against the North American continent approximately 50 million years ago (contemporaneous with the initiation of the bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain) was a major tectonic event associated with a reorganization of the earth's tectonic plates.. This is believed to have a caused a shift in the subduction zone, termination of the Laramide orogeny that was uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and major changes in tectonic and volcanic activity across much of western North America..  Exposures and discovery  The rock of Siletzia has been exposed in various places by tectonic uplift (as around the periphery of the Olympic Mountains), anticlinal folding (such as the Black Hills and Willapa Hills in southwestern Washington), and overthrusting onto other formations (along various faults in central and southern Oregon). These exposures have been variously named the Metchosin Formation of Vancouver Island, the Crescent Formation, Black Hills, and Willapa Hills volcanics of Washington, and the Siletz River Volcanics and Roseburg Formation of Oregon.; ; . (See map. The Grays River Volcanics of Washington and Tillamook Volcanics of Oregon are now considered post-Siletz.); . Elsewhere Siletzia is covered by younger volcanic and sedimentary deposits. The discovery of Siletzia began in 1906 with Arnold's description and naming of a small exposure on the north side of the Olympic Peninsula near Port Crescent.. Though this exposure is small, he recognized as very likely that much more of it was buried under younger deposits. With recognition that similar rock exposed at other outcrops is part of the same formation, the name Crescent Formation is now generally applied to all early and middle Eocene basalts on the Olympic Peninsula and Puget Lowland.. The Metchosin formation at the southern tip of Vancouver Island was described in a series of reports (1910, 1912, 1913, 1917) by Clapp, who recognized it as correlative with the Crescent formation on the other side of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.. Weaver recognized that these \\"Metchosin volcanics\\" included various Eocene basalts in western Washington and the Oregon Coast Range as far south as the Klamath Mountains.. The Siletz River Volcanics was described in 1948 by Snavely and Baldwin after exposures near the Siletz River, Oregon,Originally named the \\"Siletz River Volcanic Series\\" by , renamed by . and the Roseburg and related formations in southern Oregon described in various reports from the 1960s on.; ; ; ; . \\"Siletzia\\" was coined in 1979 by Irving to describe the full extent of these Eocene basalts and interbedded sedimentary formations..  Extent  The map shows the exposures (black) and inferred near-surface extent (pink) of Siletzia, the latter being what can be detected in the upper crust by aeromagnetic, gravitational, or seismological studies.. There are only two exposed contacts of Siletzia with the older (pre-Cenozoic) North American basement.. One is near Roseburg, Oregon, where it is thrust against formations of the Klamath Mountains (discussed below), the other is along the Leech River Fault on the southern end of Vancouver Island, where it has pushed the pre-Cenozoic Pacific Rim formation beneath the Wrangellia Terrane).. Everywhere else the contact between Siletzia and the rest of the continent is concealed under younger deposits, especially the Cascade Range volcanics. The contact around the Olympic Mountains is actually the bottom contact with the underlying oceanic sediments, tilted up by the uplift of the Olympics and exposed by erosion of about 10 to 12 km of overlying deposits.. The location of the near-surface contact between the Crescent Formation and the pre-Cenozoic metamorphic basement of the continent ‚Äî what has been the termed the Coast Range Boundary Fault (CRBF) ‚Äî is largely uncertain. The Leech River Fault extends southeast past Victoria, B.C. to cross the Strait of Juan de Fuca, possibly connecting with the southeast striking Southern Whidbey Island Fault (SWIF).The Leech River Fault/CRBF has also been aligned with possible faults in Discovery Bay and Puget Sound ‚Äî see Puget Sound faults ‚Äî but the evidence is rather against these possibilities. E.g., see and . This extends to the Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone (RMFZ), some 25 kilometers east of Seattle, which is believed to be the western edge of the pre-Cenozoic basement. However, gravity data indicates that at this latitude the Crescent Formation (at least near the surface) extends no further east than Seattle.. Further south, near Mount St. Helens, is a similar situation, where the St. Helens Fault Zone (SHZ) is believed to be the eastern edge of the Crescent Formation,. but the pre-Cenozoic continental basement is near Mount Rainier. Separating these is the marine sedimentary formation known as the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC); it is possible that it was deposited over a fragment of Siletzia.. Or not: the oldest parts of the SWCC likely predate Siletzia,; . and the nature and location of the contact between these two formations is unknown. In central Oregon, Siletzia forms a platform on which the older, now defunct volcanoes of the Western Cascades rest. The younger High Cascades to the east are believed to rest on sediments that accumulated in the basin between Siletzia and the continent.. In southern Oregon, Siletzia has been thrust against the Mesozoic Klamath Mountains of southern Oregon along the Klamath‚ÄîBlue Mountain Lineament (KBML).; . Near Roseburg this contact is exposed at the Wild Safari Fault where the Late Jurassic Dothan Formation has been thrust over the Roseburg Formation., and figure 2, p. 31. Off the coast of southern Oregon, the western edge of Siletzia is the Eocene Fulmar fault. and Fig. 64; . This is a strike-slip fault, where part of Siletzia has been split off; the missing piece may be the Yakutat terrane now at the head of the Gulf of Alaska.; ; . Further north, the terrane boundary is believed to come ashore near the Columbia River.. used seismic data to build a three- dimensional image of Siletzia beneath Washington, including the inferred western boundary. The way the Crescent Formation wraps around the Olympic Mountains (\\"Oly\\" on the map) may reflect oroclinal bending as a result of being crushed against Vancouver Island.. It has also been attributed to loss of the deposits originally overlying the Olympics prior to their uplift,; . resembling a dome where top and western end has been removed. Siletzia's actual thickness, and the estimates of that thickness, vary. Under Oregon, the Siletz terrane appears to extend 25 to possibly 35 km into the trough between the subducting Juan de Fuca plate and the edge of the continent, where it is slipping over sediments accumulated in the bottom of the trough.; . say 27¬±5 km. The Crescent terrane (under Washington) is believed to be thinner, from as little as 12 and 22 km under the western and eastern ends of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but possibly as much as 20 and 35 km thick.; .  Composition  The various formations of Siletzia are characterized as marine tholeiitic pillow basalts and volcanic breccia, often interbedded with sedimentary layers of continental origin, lying on oceanic crust. These are usually capped by a layer of alkalic volcanics deposited subaerially. and following sources. All this suggests these formations were initially deposited in an oceanic environment, possibly as seamounts or an island arc.. A more detailed description of the Siletz River Volcanics can be found in , and of the Crescent Formation in . On the Olympic Peninsula the Blue Mountain unit at the base of the Crescent Formation includes sediments (including large boulders of quartz diorite) of continental origin, suggesting that the continent was close by;. other sediments were eroded from the pre-Cenozoic rock of Vancouver Island and the northern Cascade Range.. At the southern end are sediments derived from the Klamath Mountains,; ; ; . while sand of the overlying Tyee Formation has an isotopic composition corresponding to rock of the Idaho Batholith..  Age  Eruption of the Siletzia basalts has been placed roughly in the late Paleocene through the mid Eocene; more specific dates have been difficult to obtain and somewhat variable. Early K-Ar (potassium-argon) and 40Ar-39Ar (argon-argon) radiometric dating by Duncan gave dates of 57 and 62 Ma (million years ago) to the northern and southern ends, and a date of 49 Ma for the Grays River volcanics near the center of Siletzia.. This is suggestive of a spreading ridge (as previously noted by ), and has been a strong constraint on models of how Siletzia formed. Other researchers have since found younger dates (50-48 Ma) for the Crescent basalts, removing much of the age symmetry.. Variations in geochemical alteration may also have skewed the results. ; . Dating from 2010 based on 40Ar-39Ar, U-Pb (uranium-lead), and coccoliths shows a narrower range of ages from 56 Ma in the south to 50 or 49 Ma in the north. (abstract); (abstract). Subsequent high-precision U-Pb dates from northern Siletzia. show a narrowly constrained age of 51 Ma for the Metchosin complex on Vancouver Island. Of particular interest is the somewhat broader range of approximately 53 to 48 Ma for Crescent Formation basalts on the east side of the Olympic Peninsula that overlie the Blue Mountain unit, reliably dated at 48 Ma or younger. calculated a maximal depositional age of about 48.7 Ma, while report four ages ranging from 44.7 Ma to 47.8 Ma. This structural relationship was previously understood as showing that Siletzia ‚Äì or at least its northern end ‚Äì was built on the continental margin. It is now argued. that the unconformity of ages can be explained by the Blue Mountain unit being thrust under Siletzia some time after 44.5 Ma, and shows that Siletiza was not necessarily emplaced along the continental margin.  Size  Siletzia is massive: over 400 miles (600 kilometers) long, almost half that much across (and likely further at depth). The original deposits were from 16 to 35 kilometers thick.. Weaver, reckoning a minimal thickness of only 3,000 feet, still estimated \\"nearly 10,000 cubic miles of rock\\";. he put the total volume to be as great, if not greater, than the better known Columbia River Basalts.Quoted in . Snavely et al., recognizing at least 10,000 feet of thickness, and as much as 20,000 feet under eruptive centers, estimated the volume to be in excess of 50,000 cubic miles (over 200,000 km3).. estimated around 250,000 km3 (about 60,000 cubic miles), which exceeds the volume of most continental rift zones, and some flood basalt provinces.. A recent estimate put the volume at 2 million cubic km. (abstract).  Paleorotation  Oregon Rotation: Rotation of Siletzia (green) about a northern pivot point. The Klamath Mountains (blue) rotated with Siletzia, having been formerly adjacent to the Blue Mountains (also blue, and also since rotated) near the Idaho Batholith (right edge). Red dashed line is the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament. Original image courtesy of William R. Dickinson. When lava solidifies and cools it retains an imprint of the earth's magnetic field, thus recording how it was oriented. Measurements of such paleomagnetic fields in the Oregon Coast Range show rotations of 46 to 75¬∞, all of it following the presumed accretion to the continent (alternately, formation) of the Siletz terrane at about 50 Ma. These rotations are all clockwise, and show a strong correlation with the age of the rock: about one and a half degrees of rotation per million years.; . These paleomagnetic rotations and other evidence show that Siletzia ‚Äî or the part of it constituting the Siletz terrane (\\"SZ\\" on map, above), from the Klamath Mountains to the Columbia River ‚Äî has rotated clockwise as a single, coherent block.; . Other possible rotation mechanisms are discussed by . See also . Did Siletzia pivot about its northern end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, with the evidence long suggesting a northern pivot.Second model of , as elaborated by . Several objections to a northern pivot were made by , who favored an initial phase of rotation with a southern pivot (p. 2960). Some apparent palinspastic conflicts involving the Clarno Formation of north-central Oregon appear to have been resolved by . A major problem for a southern pivot is that it implies rotation during accretion, while most studies indicate that most or all of the rotation occurred after the presumed accretion . A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old. This was previously interpreted as requiring the Crescent Formation to have formed close to the continent.. See also and . However, new high-precision U-Pb dating shows that the overlying basalts are older, and therefore the Blue Mountain unit was not overlaid by the basalts, but thrust under them at a later date.. Such under-thrusting implies that the northern end of Siletzia was initially further away from the continent, and permits radial motion about a more southerly or more easterly pivot near the Washington-Oregon border, as recently suggested.. This model has Siletzia forming on the continental margin along what is now the Olympic- Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away.; Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province. and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.; . North of the Columbia River, matters are more complicated. First, in southwestern Washington there is only half as much rotation as seen in rocks of similar age in Oregon. This is the basis for believing the Crescent terrane has broken from the Siletz terrane (perhaps because they formed on different oceanic plates),. and undergone a different rotational history.; ; . Second, in Washington there is more variation in the amount of rotation and more faulting, which has led to a speculation that the Crescent terrane has broken up into eight or nine crustal blocks.. At Bremerton, on the east side of the Olympics, the measured rotations are less, and within the statistical error bounds of being zero; while further north, near Port Townsend, the rotation is slightly counter-clockwise.. On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are counter-clockwise, and other evidence shows that the tip of the island has been bent, presumably as a result of the collision of Siletzia.. The northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula also shows counter-clockwise rotation, of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of how much of the arcuate shape of the Crescent Formation is due to loss of material from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and how much reflects oroclinal bending..  Origin  Siletzia's origin is not yet determined, and (as of 2017) remains controversial.. has previously said \\"it lacks a definite answer.\\" Theories are still being developed, and even the details the theories depend on \\"have remained enigmatic\\".. Following are several of the most notable models. Models of how Siletzia formed are of two general types: call these the seamount interpretation and the marginal basin interpretation. count only three general models, restricting the first to hotspot volcanism on a spreading ridge, and counting slab windows as a third model. provide an updated summary. (1) Formation well offshore (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation inshore, on or near the continental margin (perhaps as a result of transcurrent extension, or of a slab window). All current models then have Siletzia rifting away from the continental edge about a northern pivot.Some early models had Siletzia rotating into the continent about a southern pivot, accretion therefore being the culmination of rotation. The southern pivot seems to be largely abandoned, in part because various studies (e.g.: ; ; ) show most of the rotation was post-accretion. These classes of models have been classified as either \\"accreted\\" or \\"rifted,\\" but this is inaccurate as inshore formation can still involve accretion, and all offshore accretion models using a northern pivot imply rifting. Studies of Siletzia's origins have generally focused on accounting for two principal observations: the large paleorotation (described above), and the voluminous output (over 50,000 cubic miles, exceeding the volume of most continental rift zones, and some flood basalt provinces).. Accounting for the observed volumes of basalt requires an enhanced magmatic source, for which most models invoke either the presence of the Yellowstone hotspot, or slab windows.. The latter would have resulted from the subduction of the Farallon‚ÄîKula (or possibly Farallon‚ÄîResurrection) spreading ridge. The relation with the Kula-Farallon spreading ridge is an important element in all models, though its location through that epoch is not well determined. show the uncertainty in the position of the K-F ridge at 65 Ma as anywhere from Mexico to the Queen Charlotte Islands. See also figure 1 in , showing the K-F ridge alternately near Washington, or near Anchorage.  Simpson & Cox 1977: Two models  Seeking to explain the observed clockwise paleorotation, and noting that Siletzia appeared to have rotated as a rigid block, proposed two models. First was rotation about a southern pivot in contact with the Klamath Mountains. This has various problems, especially because at the northern end sediments and even boulders from the continent are found at the base of the Crescent Formation, showing that it was near the continent from the beginning.. In the second model (subsequently refined by ), Siletzia was originally adjacent to the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament, then rifted from the continent and rotated about a northern pivot near the Olympic Peninsula. Because sediments also show the Klamaths in close contact from the start, this requires the Klamaths to have moved with Siletzia. Originally there were conflicts in the understanding of when the Klamaths moved, and with the age and amount of rotation of the Clarno Formation in central Oregon. These were largely cleared up in a study of the Clarno Formation by and illustrated with a palinspastic reconstruction as of 38 Ma.  Offshore model: A captured island chain?  An early and widely cited paper by (drawing on features of the fairly new theory of plate tectonics) exemplifies the off-shore or \\"seamount\\" type of models. It featured a set of radiometrically determined (K-Ar and 40Ar-39Ar) ages that were younger in the center (for the Grays River volcanics) and older at the ends. This dihedrally symmetric age progression strongly suggested the pattern seen at spreading ridges, where the older rock is carried away on both sides from where the new rock erupts. Duncan considered five models (but none involving rifting or ridge subduction),. favoring one where a hotspot ‚Äî presumably the Yellowstone hotspot ‚Äî intersected the Farallon-Kula spreading ridge (such as at Iceland) to generate a chain of islands. These islands were then accreted to the continent as the underlying oceanic crust was subducted. This study has been criticized on multiple grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that measurement of the northern ages may have been affected by loss of argon due to low-grade metamorphism, and that there might be bias in respect of stratigraphic position.. The latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions,. And substantially younger, at 42 to 37 Ma. and thus are not representative of the initial phase of Siletz magmatism. Recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression (\\"younging\\").. The range of the original ages was also a problem, as the rate of Kula-Farallon spreading over that time would produce a chain of seamounts much longer than observed, and too far away from the continent to explain the continentally derived sediments.. This objection is attenuated somewhat in that the newer ages show a smaller range of ages.. See also .  Inshore models  Various models have Siletzia forming inshore, on or near the continental margin. While all current models have Siletzia rifting away from the continent after accretion or formation, a subclass of \\"rifted\\" models consider the rifting to have caused the Siletzia eruptions. proposed that the Siletzia basalts might have \\"leaked\\" through transform faults (perpendicular to a spreading ridge) during changes in direction of the tectonic plates. The size of these eruptions and their location in this region is attributed to proximity to the Yellowstone hotspot.. This \\"leaky transform\\" theory seems to be largely rejected, likely because the plate motion model it was based on was shown to be faulty.. Wells, et al., alternately suggested that as a terrane at the margin of the continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was rifted away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts.. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is the formation of a slab window (or slab gap) which would allow increased upwelling of magma..  Slab windows  That spreading ridges could be subducted was recognized early in the development of plate tectonic theory, but there was little consideration of the ensuing effects. In the 1980s came realization that the magma welling up from the asthenosphere through the subducted ridge would not reach seawater, and thus not be quenched to form rock and close the gap. Continued spreading would lead to a widening gap or \\"window\\" in the subducting plate through which there could be increased flow of magma.. The implications of this for Siletzia were first shown by and (following the pioneering work by ).; . subsequently identified the fan-shaped wake of volcanics of distinctive geochemistry left by the widening Kula- Farallon slab window across northeastern Washington and into Idaho. showed that most of the Eocene and subsequent magmatism from Alaska to Oregon \\"is explainable in terms of ridge subduction and slab window tectonics\\".. Their model has the northern part of the Resurrection plate separating at about 47 Ma to form the Eshamy plate. That is, a slab window ‚Äî and a single subducted ridge can give rise to multiple slab windows ‚Äî can provide adequate magmatism without having to invoke a hotspot (mantle plume). (So much so that it has been suggested that the Yellowstone hotspot may have been initiated by a slab window.). See also . Mantle plumes and slab windows both feature voluminous magmatism; the main difference is that slab windows would form only where the spreading ridge is subducted. This implies formation at the continental margin, and then rifting, in the manner of the second class of models.  Gulf of Alaska  Any model of the origin of Siletzia must account for interactions with plate boundaries that were being subducted under North America through the Eocene. Early studies were plagued by indeterminate locations for these boundaries, particularly of the Kula-Farallon (K-F) spreading ridge: basalts at the head of the Gulf of Alaska (along the Alaska panhandle) have ages and compositions corresponding to the Siletz volcanics, suggesting that the K-F ridge was offshore of the Yukon at the same time it was offshore of Washington. This can be resolved by assuming that by about 56 Ma the eastern part of the Kula plate had broken away to form the Resurrection plate, with the new Kula-Resurrection (K-R) spreading ridge running up the Gulf of Alaska towards Kodiak Island, and the former K-F (now R-F) ridge reaching Washington.See figure 1 in . Subduction of this plate under western Canada was rapid, and it disappeared entirely with subduction of the K-R ridge about 50 Ma.. This scenario then permits rapid transport north of crustal blocks such as the Yakutat terrane. Now lying southeast of Cordova at the head of the Gulf of Alaska, paleomagnetic evidence indicates it was formed at a latitude corresponding to Oregon or northern California.. See also . Similarly, certain schists on Baranof Island are believed to have been contiguous with the Leech River Schists (Leech River Complex) on Vancouver Island around 50 Ma, and subsequently transported northward with other elements of the Chugach-Prince William terrane. and figure 4.  After accretion: 50-42 Ma  Whether formed far offshore as seamounts, or close inshore by a slab window, the Siletzian basalts were laid down on a subducting oceanic plate: the Siletz terrane on the Farallon plate, and the Crescent terrane most likely on the adjoining Resurrection plate (previously broken away from the Kula plate, which had previously broken away from the Farallon plate). In both cases the Siletzia mass was drawn toward the subduction zone, which possibly ran diagonally across what is now Washington, approximately at the position of the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament., figure 5; see also . This would be the Challis subduction zone, but there is some question about it. See ; ; . However, Siletzia was too big to be subducted, and it accreted to the continent. Accretion is sometimes called \\"docking,\\" but is more akin to a collision: various peripheral structures are first folded or crushed, then the main structures are deformed when they come into contact, and various parts get pushed over other parts, all this playing out over several million years. To the extent that the accretion of Siletzia to North America can be given a definite date most studies give it as about 50 Ma.; . Some early studies (e.g., ) dated accretion as late as 42 Ma. A recent study suggests it may have been as early as 55 Ma. This date has added significance as it is also the start of a change in direction of the Pacific plate, as seen in the bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, and also a change in the Pacific Northwest from compressional to extensional tectonics.; ; ; . This may also be when the last of the Resurrection plate was subducted under British Columbia.. Initiation of the north-striking right-lateral Straight Creek Fault at ~48 Ma. likely resulted from strain accumulated during the accretion of Siletzia. As Siletzia accreted it also jammed the existing subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny that had been uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 20 and 50 Ma.; . This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but the details of this are unknown.; ; . Subduction, having ceased at the existing zone, eventually reinitiated further to the west as the current Cascadia subduction zone.; ; . How this happened does not seem to be detailed anywhere, but figure 5 of suggests that the new subduction zone may have simply unzipped from the old zone, starting from the south. Volcanism from the new subduction zone (such as the Grays River Volcanics. and Northcraft Volcanics). reached the surface about 42 Ma, thereby initiating the rise of the ancestral Cascade Range.. Several other significant events occurred around 42 Ma, including cessation of metamorphism of the Leech River Schists. (resulting from the Metchosin/Crescent Formation being thrust under Vancouver Island) and the end of strike-slip motion on the Straight Creek Fault;. these may reflect the last movement of Siletzia relative to North America. On a broader scale, there was a change in absolute direction of the Pacific plate. (marked by the end of the bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain), and a change in the convergence of the Kula plate with the North American plate.. As subduction waned so did the force that had clamped Siletzia against the continent, and the tectonic regime shifted from compressional to extensional.. Deposition of sand from the then proximal Idaho Batholith into the Tyee Formation in southern Oregon may have continued as late as 46.5 Ma,. but was interrupted when Siletzia rifted from the continent and began rotating away.As explained earlier, it appears the rotation was about a northern pole. What initiated rifting is unknown. suggested that as the continent overrode the Yellowstone hotspot, the upwelling plume tore away a previously accreted terrane. suggested a change in the rate at which the plates were converging, or the \\"kinematic effects\\" (such as a slab window) from the passage of the Kula-Farallon ridge (or Resurrection-Farallon ridge)..

El≈ëre (Forward) was a Hungarian-language socialist magazine published in the United States by activists of the Hungarian Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America. Launched in September 1905, El≈ëre was published for 16 years before going bankrupt in October 1921. The discontinued publication was immediately succeeded by a new Hungarian-language communist periodical called √öj El≈ëre (New Forward). Publication history Hungarian emigration to the United States Substantial emigration from Hungary to the United States of America dates from the decade of the 1880s, during which more than 25,000 people left the Kingdom of Hungary for the new world.Julianna Pusk√°s, \\"Hungarians,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 2: Migrants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 313. This wave of emigration accelerated in succeeding decades, with more than 55,000 leaving for America in the decade of the 1890s and more than 311,000 in the first decade of the 20th Century. Emigration from Hungary to America peaked in 1907, declining precipitously from the 1920s. A substantial majority of those leaving the Kingdom of Hungary were members of ethnic minority groups, including Slovaks, Germans, and Jews. In the estimate of one leading scholar, ethnic Hungarians comprised only about one-third of those emigrating from Hungary to the United States during the 19th and first decades of the 20th Century. Those emigrating to America from the Kingdom of Hungary were predominantly rural, with about three-quarters of those arriving before World War I coming from agricultural towns and villages. Of these, about half were largely unskilled and impoverished agricultural laborers. Those leaving were driven by unemployment and the low standard of living in rural Hungary ‚Äî a situation exacerbated by the kingdom's extremely unequal system of land distribution.Pusk√°s, \\"Hungarians,\\" pg. 314. Only about 20% of emigrants to America in this period can be accurately characterized as members of the urban working class, to which the international socialist movement made its most explicit ideological appeal. Despite the poor and rural social composition of the √©migr√© Hungarian community in America, certain socialist influence had made itself felt. The Marxist movement in Hungary had emerged in 1880 with the formation of the General Workers' Party of Hungary (Magyarorsz√°gi Altal√°nos Munk√°sp√°rt), a group which renamed itself the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (Magyarorsz√°gi Szoci√°ldemokrata P√°rt) in 1890. This organization was particularly strong in the Hungarian trade union movement and that connection of organized politics with organized labor was echoed in the activities of the Hungarian colony on American soil as former peasants became semi-skilled and skilled industrial workers. Establishment Socialist Hungarian √©migr√©s first began to engage in organized radical politics in America during the decade of the 1890s.Pusk√°s, \\"Hungarians,\\" pg. 315. Initial activity was concentrated in the leading American Marxist political party of the day, the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP), which established a Hungarian language section in New York City in 1892. This activity was paralleled by the formation of a number of Hungarian-American fraternal-benefit organizations, including five national Sickness Benefit and Workers' Aid groups. One of these, the Workers Benefit and Educational Association, launched a newspaper called N√©pakarat (People's Will) in 1903 and began to take an active role in party politics. The Hungarian-American socialists split into two camps in 1904, with one part continuing to support the SLP while others gave their allegiance to the upstart Socialist Party of America (SPA), which was established in the summer of 1901. The majority group who remained loyal to the more orthodox and Marxist SLP, formed a new Sickness Benefit association of their own called the Socialist Hungarian Workers Federation, while retaining control of N√©pakarat. Those minority members giving allegiance to the rival SPA remained with the already existing Workers Benefit and Educational Association and launched a new newspaper called El≈ëre (Forward) in September 1905.Pusk√°s, \\"Hungarians,\\" pp. 315-316. Development El≈ëre was briefly merged with N√©pakarat in 1911 under the name of the older publication.Julianna Puskas, \\"El≈ëre,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 2: Migrants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 323. This unification of the Hungarian-American socialist movement proved short-lived, however, and the two groups split once more in November 1912, with El≈ëre once again emerging as a separate publication. The circulation of El≈ëre at the time of its 1912 reemergence was approximately 10,000. In 1915 El≈ëre came under direct control of the Hungarian Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party. The publication took a staunchly anti-militarist position towards the European world war, continuing its opposition even after American entry into the conflict in the spring of 1917. This opposition to the American war effort brought the paper into conflict with Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson and the administration of President Woodrow Wilson, and mail distribution to subscribers was hampered and its editors subjected to police pressure. Dissolution In 1919 the Socialist Party of America was split into radical and moderate wings. The Hungarian Socialist Federation gave its organizational support to the dissident Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party and was suspended from the SPA along with half a dozen other language federations of the party by the governing National Executive Committee in June. Supporters of the new Communist Party of America gained a dominant position on El≈ëre's editorial board, but financial connections were disrupted in the process. In October 1921 the entity formally publishing El≈ëre, known as the Elore Publishing Corporation, declared itself financially insolvent and the publication was terminated. This lapse proved brief, however, as within a month a new explicitly communist Hungarian language publication was launched, called √öj El≈ëre. This successor publication would continue publication without interruption until its eventual termination in 1937.Julianna Puskas, \\"√öj El≈ëre,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 2: Migrants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe.

The cap of this mushroom is about in diameter, greyish brown to brown. The gills start out white but they soon turn pink. The stipe is white and has a volva at the base. Microscopical features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating this taxon from related species. V. asiaticus is a saprotrophic fungus that was originally described as growing on the ground, in the humus layer. It is only known from Hokkaido (Japan).  Taxonomy  The type collection of this species was originally reported under the name Volvariella gloiocephala by Takehashi and colleagues in 2010. Morphological revision and DNA sequence data obtained from these specimens showed that this taxon belongs in the genus Volvopluteus and that is a separate species from all the other members of that genus. The epithet asiaticus makes reference to the fact that this species was originally described, and thus far only known, from Asia. The type collection of this species is preserved at the National Museum of Nature and Science.  Description   Macroscopic characters  The cap of Volvopluteus asiaticus is between in diameter, more or less ovate or conical when young, then expands to convex or flat, it can have an umbo at center in mature specimens; the surface is markedly viscid in fresh basidiocarps and rugose, with powdery, minute, whitish scales. The color varies from greyish brown to brown, with a dark brown center. The gills are crowded, free from the stipe, ventricose, up to broad; white when young and turning pink with age. The stipe is long and wide, clavate with a bulbous base; the surface is white, smooth or striate. The volva is sacciform, white and with a smooth surface, up to high. The context is white on stipe and pileus, and it does not change when bruised or exposed to air, but it is dark grey-brown right under the pileipellis. Data on smell, taste and spore print were not recorded.  Microscopic characters  The basidiospores are 12‚Äì14.5 by 7‚Äì8.5 ¬µm and ellipsoid. Basidia are 29‚Äì45 by 10‚Äì15 ¬µm and four-spored. Pleurocystidia are 45‚Äì85 by 12‚Äì30 ¬µm, fusiform or utriform, and commonly have an apical excrescence up to 10‚Äì15 ¬µm long. Cheilocystidia are 45‚Äì70 by 14‚Äì25 ¬µm, mostly lageniform, a few clavate, utriform or ovate; they completely cover the gill edge. The pileipellis is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae wide embedded in a gelatinous matrix), while the Stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia are sometimes present, and they measure 100‚Äì250 by 10‚Äì15 ¬µm, mostly cylindrical. File:Asiaticus pleurocystidia.jpgPleurocystidia of Volvopluteus asiaticus File:Asiaticus cheilocystidia.jpgCheilocystidia of Volvopluteus asiaticus  Ecology  Volvopluteus asiaticus is a saprotrophic mushroom. The type collection was collected on the ground, in a forest area.  Distribution  This species is only known from the type locality: Tonebetsu Nature Park in Hokkaido, Japan.  Similar species  Molecular analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the basidiocarps, color of the pileus, spore size, presence or absence of cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. Volvopluteus asiaticus stands apart from other species by the pleurocystidia provided with apical excrescences and the cheilocystidia that are predominantly lageniform.

Early life Showing early signs of his eventual 6'8\\", 280-pound frame which would earn him the nickname \\"Big Jim\\", James Joseph McCafferty was born in Scammon, Kansas, weighing 19 pounds. Shortly thereafter, his family moved to Henryetta, Oklahoma, where McCafferty grew up and played high school football. He was recruited by Loyola of the South to play football, but when the school dropped its football program after his freshman year, he switched to playing basketball for three seasons (1940‚Äì43). As a senior, he helped lead Loyola to a Dixie Conference Championship, and was named MVP of the tournament. Coaching career After graduating with a degree in physical education in 1942, McCafferty remained at Loyola as the assistant coach in both basketball and track. He was the assistant under Coach Jack Orsley when the Wolfpack won the NAIA championship in 1945. Then in 1948, McCafferty was invited to coach Team USA at the Central American Olympic Games in Panama, and he led the U.S. to a gold medal. McCafferty became Loyola's head basketball coach in 1953, and led the Wolfpack for four seasons, including Loyola's first two NCAA Tournament appearances in 1954 and 1957. Unfortunately, the Wolfpack lost in the first round in both tournaments. After the 1957 season, he was named head coach at Xavier University. In his first season at Xavier, McCafferty led the Musketeers to the NIT, which it won against longtime rival Dayton, then coached by legendary Tom Blackburn. Then, in 1961, the Musketeers made it to their first NCAA Tournament. McCafferty was head coach at Xavier for six seasons until 1963. He also served as the school's athletic director from 1962 to 1979. After trying for over two decades to get Xavier into a Division I Conference, McCafferty's work paid off in 1979 when Xavier became a founding member of the new Midwestern City Conference (MCC), which became the Horizon League in 1985. McCafferty served as the first Commissioner of the MCC during the 1979-80 school year. Awards and recognition McCafferty was selected in 1958 as Catholic College Coach of the Year, and Ohio College Coach of the Year. He has been inducted into the Halls of Fame at both Loyola and Xavier, as well as the Cincinnati Basketball Hall of Fame, and twice was designated to receive Loyola's Distinguished Alumnus Award. In 2011, he was awarded a spot in the Sugar Bowl Hall of Fame. In his honor, the McCafferty Trophy is annually awarded to a school which is recognized as the all-sport champion of the Horizon League.

The novel was republished in 2015 by Valancourt Books. Early biography The mini-biography on the back flap of his first novel says: \\"He was born in London but brought up in Canada where his father was a broker and his mother an actress. He grew up in an atmosphere of the theatre and comfortable bohemianism until the great slump of the early thirties when the family fell on hard times and returned to England. He worked his way back to Canada on a Danish coal boat in 1935 and has worked since in various jobs including that of labourer in a sheet-metal works, in a travel agency and as a telephone installation mechanic.\\" He joined the Young Communist League in the 1930s, an act which estranged him from his father. He married Cecily Fearn in 1940. Between 1940 and 1946 he served with the Royal Corps of Signals and was in the Western Desert and other parts of the Middle East Command, finishing the war in Germany. After the war, in 1947, he entered the emergency training scheme for teachers, and began teaching a year later. He also turned away from communism and joined the Labour Party. Works His first novel, Tram-stop by the Nile, was published in 1958. It was largely well-received, with the Irish Times reviewer describing it as \\"probably the first novel to describe the war in the desert, not from the point of view of the heroes of El Alamein, but from the angle of the international spivs and racketeers who lived in Cairo throughout the war years...\\". The reviewer from the Oxford Mail agreed, saying it was a \\"first-rate, first-hand account of the middle of the campaign in the Western Desert. I have not read a more vivid account of the terror and misery caused by a retreat in which no one knew where he was going or what he was doing.\\" On a more literary level, Vernon Fane in The Sphere proclaimed that \\"Mr Wallis not only seems to understand what his characters are up to but understands a good deal about that great peril of wartime: boredom. His dialogue is lively and revealing and his observation acute...The author is at his most inspired, though, when dealing with the mysteries of Army directives. Here he is good enough to send a cold, retrospective shiver down the spine.\\" His second novel, Paved with Gold, was published in 1959 in Britain, and under the variant title A Girl with Class in the US in 1960. It is the satirical story of two ambitious working-class people, Tom and Carole, whose affair is put to the test in post-war London's freed-up and booming world of make or break. Philip Oakes in the Observer said that it was a \\"shrewd, funny and absorbing story of young lovers ‚Äì both hauling themselves up the social ladder by way of big business ‚Äì whose affair is mangled by a takeover bid. Clearly written by someone in love with London (including the City) and whose ear is keen enough to catch the whimpers beneath the post-war boom.\\" His third novel, and his most famous, was Only Lovers Left Alive, published in 1964.David Simonelli -Working Class Heroes: Rock Music and British Society in the 1960s ... 2012‚Äì p94 \\"Even the Rolling Stones entertained film scripts and at one point were scheduled to play parts in an adaptation of the Dave Wallis novel, Only Lovers Left Alive (1964).33 None of these efforts was particularly successful critically‚Äîit would not ...\\"Billboard ‚Äì 1966 5 21 p40 \\"LOS. ANGELES. \\"Only Lovers Left Along,\\" a novel by English author Dave Wallis, will be used as the screenplay for the movie debut of the Rolling Stones. The group will receive a reported $1 million from British Decca for their movie venture.\\" It is an eerily dystopian novel which asks the reader to imagine Britain taken over by teenagers. All the adults have done away with themselves by taking 'Easiway' suicide pills. The world immediately begins to crumble and shortage of all kinds leads to warfare. This updated echo of Lord of the Flies by William Golding is presented by Wallis in contemporary slang and a notably vivid, if dark, style. The new fiction reviewer in The Times said that the \\"anti-social helmeted figures on the motorcycles, riding on their quests to plunder and attacking one another's strongholds, one of which is Windsor Castle, have a quality oddly like Malory's, and Mr. Wallis obviously enjoys drawing the parallel between his youngsters thrown on their own resources, learning how to live in the ruins of the sophisticated adult world, and the story of mankind settling down in the west after the barbarian invasions of the dark ages.\\" The British first edition of the novel, published by Anthony Blond, has an era-defining, evocative staged wraparound jacket photograph by Bruce Fleming. In 1966 it was announced that The Rolling Stones would make their film debuts in a motion picture of the novel to be directed by Nicholas Ray and produced by Allen Klein and Andrew Loog Oldham. The film was never made. His last novel, published in 1971, was The Bad Luck Girl. The main character, Celestine, escapes from a remand home at the age of sixteen, and contrives to get herself smuggled aboard a small freighter bound for a South American island by the lustful crew. The story echoes maritime folklore in its fulfilment of an ancient seagoing superstition ‚Äì a woman aboard ship is bad luck. Wallis pictures Celestine, in all her co-operative but ruthless manipulation, as the selfish sailors' secret nemesis. Final years After a spell in north London in the 1960s, Wallis worked as a teacher at Earls Colne Grammar School, teaching English and French from 1971 until its closure in 1975. He died in 1990.

In 2018, the company was acquired by the Japanese firm, Recruit Holdings, for US$1.2 billion. The company is headquartered in Mill Valley, California, with additional offices in Chicago, Dublin, London, and S√£o Paulo. Founding The company was cofounded in 2007 by Tim Besse, Robert Hohman, who serves as the company's CEO, and Expedia founder Rich Barton, who served as the company's Chairman. The idea came from a brainstorming session between the two of them, when Hohman relayed the story of accidentally leaving the results of an employee survey on the printer while working at Expedia‚Äîwhen the two began to think about what would have happened if the results had gotten out into the public. The two hypothesized that if the material had indeed been revealed publicly, it could have been a service to those looking to make career decisions. The company's headquarters were established in Mill Valley. Website Glassdoor launched its company ratings site in June 2008,Erik Schonfeld, TechCrunch, June 10, 2008, At Glassdoor, Find Out How Much People Really Make At Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, And Everywhere Else. as a site that ‚Äúcollects company reviews and real salaries from employees of large companies and displays them anonymously for all members to see,‚Äù according to TechCrunch. The company then averaged the reported salaries, posting these averages alongside the reviews employees made of the management and culture of the companies they worked for‚Äîincluding some of the larger tech companies like Google and Yahoo. The site also allows the posting of office photographs and other company-relevant media. The site later also began focusing on CEOs and workplaces, as well as what it is like to work at jobs in general. Employee reviews are averaged for each company. Glassdoor ratings are based on user- generated reviews. Each year Glassdoor ranks overall company ratings to determine its annual Employees‚Äô Choice Awards, also known as the Best Places to Work Awards.Rob Grant, Daily Telegraph, April 8, 2013, Facebook voted world's best employer The website verifies that each review of a company comes from real employees \\"through technological checks of e-mail addresses and through screenings by a content management team,\\" according to Glassdoor spokesman Scott Dobroski.Vanessa Wong, BusinessWeek, March 18, 2013, Why Employees Like Zuckerberg (and Other Popular CEOs) The company has stated that it rejects about 20% of entries after screening.Calgary Herald, April 10, 2013, Website lets workers rate their bosses anonymously Rules for posting reviews are different for smaller companies than they are for larger companies in order to preserve the anonymity of people in close departments. In 2010, Glassdoor released a fee-based program that it calls \\"Enhanced Employer Profiles\\", which allows employers to include their own content on Glassdoor profiles, like executive biographies, classifieds, social media links, and referrals.Nick Wingfield, Wall Street Journal, June 23, 2010, Employers Sound Off on Company Review Site The company also allows users to post potential job interview questions that might be asked by certain companies, acquired by interviewed job candidates, in addition to other information that can be used to prepare job applications. The reputation a company has on Glassdoor has also been found correlative by Case Western Professor Casey Newmeyer. It has also been used to vet potential client companies. In 2014, the company hired Adam Spiegel as its CFO, with the intention of preparing for an eventual IPO. By 2015, the site had 30 million users from 190 countries and corporate clients including one third of all Fortune 500 companies. That year, Glassdoor also began creating localized websites and mobile apps for different national jurisdictions, such as Germany. In September 2016, Glassdoor acquired Brazil's Love Mondays to expand into Latin America. The company's own site stats updated Q1 2017 show 41 million unique users and 5,800 paying employer clients or partners. The statistics showed that the average company rating is 3.3, on a 5-point scale where 1.0 is very dissatisfied; 72% of employees rate their job/company 'ok' and average CEO approval rating is 67%. In 2017, Glassdoor announced on its website that it would no longer post job advertisements that exclude people with criminal records. In November 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals required the disclosure of Glassdoor's anonymous users' identities to prosecutors investigating possible criminal misconduct by their employers. Investigators sought to speak with reviewers who might have seen crimes committed. The court‚Äôs decision did not require sharing reviewers' identities with employers. In February 2019, Glassdoor announced that COO Christian Sutherland-Wong would be promoted to President & COO. In May 2020, Glassdoor announced it was laying off 300 people. The cut accounted for 30% of the company's workforce and half of employees in the Chicago office. In an internal memo, CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong cited an overall decrease in hiring and recruiting across multiple industries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports Glassdoor produces reports based upon the data its anonymous and, in many cases, managers generate positive reviews for their organizations through posts. These reports have been on topics including work-life balance, CEO pay-ratios, lists of the best office places and cultures, and the accuracy of corporate job searching maxims. Data from Glassdoor has also been used by outside sources to produce estimates on the effects of salary trends and changes on corporate revenues. Glassdoor also puts the conclusions of its research of other companies towards its own company policies. In 2015, Tom Lakin produced the first study of Glassdoor in the United Kingdom, concluding that Glassdoor is regarded by users as more trustworthy sources of information than career guides or official company documents. Financing The company received its first financing in 2008, receiving $3 million in funding, before launching its website. In 2012 Glassdoor received $20 million of venture capital, taking its total outside funding to $42.2 million.Sarah Perez, TechCrunch, October 31, 2012, Glassdoor Raises $20M Series D To Expand Internationally The following year, the company raised an additional $50 million. In 2015 the company raised an additional $70 million, in an investment round led by Google Capital, giving the company a valuation of just short of $1 billion. The total of investment at this point was $160 million. In 2016 Glassdoor raised an additional $40 million from investors. In May 2018, Recruit Holdings announced its intention to acquire Glassdoor for $1.2 billion in cash, with the acquisition completed in June 2018. Awards In April 2013, Glassdoor won a Red Herring North America Award for Social Media Innovation.

History  AnastasiaDate was founded in 1993. The brand AnastasiaDate was named after the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, who was seen as role model for young Russian women. In the early 1990s when the company first launched, it used catalogs to introduce men to Russian women. The company launched its first website in January 1997 and expanded its business in more cities throughout Russia and Ukraine. By 2003, it experienced global growth beyond northern Asia. Following the growth of AnastasiaDate, the company spun off three websites during 2007, each connecting western men with women from different areas of the world: AmoLatina, AsianBeauties, and AfricaBeauties. AnastasiaDate was featured in the Canadian documentary film Love Translated in 2010. In 2011, AnastasiaDate was sold by Anastasia International to a private investor. AnastasiaDate, along with each of the three spin-off websites, became independently operated. The company and its sister sites are now owned by Social Discovery Ventures. Fortune reported that the company earned $110 million in 2012. The website's traffic also grew by 220% in 2012. In 2013, the company hired Mark Brooks, whom Anne VanderMey described in Fortune as \\"a prominent online dating industry consultant\\", as its Chief Strategy Officer. In the Fortune interview, Brooks said that his goal was to improve the reputation of AnastasiaDate and the international online dating industry as a whole, saying that the industry is \\"on the cusp of respectability\\". In 2013, AnastasiaDate launched its first mobile app on iTunes and Google Play for Apple Inc. and Android devices. The company alleged in a US Federal Court in New York complaint that EM Online had created two websites, anastasiadatefraud.com and ruadventures.com, to broadcast fabricated, negative testimonials, but the complaint was dismissed.  Operations  AnastasiaDate is one of the largest international dating services. Users can register for an account on the internet or through its mobile app. Notifications are sent to users when their profiles are viewed or if they match another user's search results. AnastasiaDate site contains over 8,000 profiles of women from Eastern Europe to browse or search through. The site features various communication services such as email correspondence, live chat and video chat. The site is mostly used by wealthy American men between the ages of 35 and 60. The site makes money by charging users who want to meet Eastern European women. As of 2012, such users buy credits \\"priced on a sliding scale, starting at $15.99 for 20 credits, and going up to $399.99 for 1,000. Each minute of simple, instant messaging-style chatting costs one credit. Special, premium smilies ‚Äì like a vibrating, multi-color LOL ‚Äì cost extra. Cam share (audio not enabled) costs six credits a minute. Video chat with voice costs even more\\". The Fortune article observes: \\"And thanks to people like me willing to pay to talk with beautiful young women like Anastasia ‚Äì who was paid to respond ‚Äì the trade is doing pretty well\\".  DDOS attack  In September 2015, Anastasiadate.com suffered from a series of DDoS attacks that rendered it inaccessible to users for four to six hours every day. Having demonstrated their capability, hackers contacted the dating site and demanded US$10,000 (¬£7,234) in exchange for stopping further attacks. After this incident, Anastasiadate.com hired a data security company to investigate this case, identify those responsible, and bring the perpetrators to justice. During the investigation experts at International data security firm Group-IB confirmed that the attack was carried out by Ukrainian nationals Gayk Grishkian and Inna Yatsenko. They also found that the two hackers targeted other prominent firms like US-based Stafford Associated that leased data center and hosting facilities and another firm named PayOnline. Subsequently, a complaint filed by the company helped Ukrainian authorities arrest the two hackers and an analysis of data stored in their confiscated devices confirmed their involvement in the crimes. After they pleaded guilty, they were sentenced to five years in prison.  Reception  With the growth of online services like AnastasiaDate, the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act was passed in 2005 to regulate the industry. News outlets call AnastasiaDate the leading \\"premium international dating\\" website and have observed its efforts to seemingly rebrand the mail-order bride industry, within which it is grouped. The Guardian journalist reported that \\"none of the men I became close to on my tour ended up in lasting relationships, and the majority appeared to fall victim to a number of sophisticated scams\\". A girl on the site who was interviewed \\"explained the whole sordid array of techniques, from a light impersonalised online-chatting version to a full-service chauffeur-driven platinum fraud, where men are rinsed of cash for a full week in Odessa, thinking they are cementing a lifelong relationship while actually they are being strung along on platonic dates that end with them dispatched to the airport with heavy hearts and empty wallets\\". The same article added that \\"AnastasiaDate insists that it weeds out scams whenever it finds them, and has banned some women from the site\\". Even acting within the regulations, international dating sites like AnastasiaDate could potentially exploit women in less-developed countries and male suitors in developed countries. A 2014 report in The Guardian found examples of exploitation for both genders.

He is credited by reggae historians for the birth of rocksteady in the 1960s. Rocksteady later mixed with Jamaican mento, a genre in which Khouri also had a pioneering role, leading to the creation of reggae music. Khouri signed American singer Johnny Nash to record Jamaican music, producing his first international hit \\"Hold Me Tight\\", which went on to sell six million copies globally and has been credited with first putting reggae in the American listener charts. He also produced Nash's biggest hit in the UK \\"Tears on my Pillow\\", which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in July 1975 for one week. Biography He was born in St Catherine Parish, the son of a Lebanese immigrant father and a mother of Cuban origin, and grew up in Richmond and Highgate. His family was in the dry goods and furniture business. He moved to Kingston as a young man and joined the retail company E.A. Issa and Brothers Limited which owned jukeboxes operating in rum bars all over the island. The company was owned by the Issa family who were friends of his family, and there he learned about the music business.Balford Henry, \\"Ken Khouri: pioneer of Jamaican recording industry\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 28 September 2003. Retrieved 17 April 2013 When his father required specialist hospital treatment, he flew with him to Miami, Florida, and by chance overheard someone selling a disc recording machine. Khouri bought the machine and discs, and returned with it to Kingston, where in 1947 he set up a voice recording service. Khouri made recordings of local bands, and since there were no record pressing facilities in Jamaica, he sent them to the United Kingdom to be pressed. Realising the commercial possibilities, he decided to set up a music recording business and traveled to California to acquire the equipment he needed to set up his own plant. Having until then had records pressed in the US, he also set up a record pressing plant in the early 1950s, and began pressing copies of American records under licence. Initially, Khouri mainly released mento and calypso music, later recording early examples of ska and rocksteady. In the early 1950s, he set up the Times Record Limited label with Alec Durie, owner of the Times store in Kingston, and began producing Mento records by local musicians, the first time this had been done in Jamaica. One of his earliest recordings was Lord Flea's \\"Naughty Little Flea\\". The records pressed by Khouri and others such Stanley Motta helped created the golden age of mento music and brought it to a new audience. Times Records Limited was renamed as Federal Records in the early 1960s.  Federal Records  The company was a powerhouse during the 1960s and 1970s. Ken Lazarus, Ernie Smith, Ken Boothe, Pluto Shervington, guitarist Ernst Ranglin, Don Drummond, Winston Turner Quintet, Eric Grant Orchestra, Gladstone Anderson, Cecil Lloyd, The Maytals, Eric Morris, Granville Williams Orchestra, Delroy Wilson, Marcia Griffiths, Bob Andy, Derrick Harriott, Tinga Stewart, Roland Alphonso, John Holt, The Meditations, John Jones, Eddie Lovette, The Zodiacs, Byron Lee & The Dragonaires, Archie Lewis, were just some of the acts who recorded hit songs there. In 1965, singer Hopeton Lewis recorded his rocksteady hit \\"Take It Easy\\" at Federal Records usually recognized as the first rocksteady single recorded. The slower and bassier beat style of this new rocksteady genre became the choice of partygoers in Jamaica over the previous jazz-based Ska. This led Khouri to the creation of Merritone Label in 1966 within the Federal Records roster. Merritone was successful as well as influential, although short-lived. Khouri signed American singer Johnny Nash to record Jamaican music, producing his first international hit \\"Hold Me Tight\\" in 1968, which went on to sell six million copies globally and placed reggae in the American listener charts. Bob Marley recorded his first single \\"Judge Not\\" in 1962 at Federal Records. Jimmy Cliff also cut his first track in 1962 at Federal studios for Count Boysie‚Äôs sound system, who, in turn, would air the track at dances, although the single was never released. Jamaican artist Ken Boothe's reggae version of the song \\"Everything I Own\\" was released in 1974 by Federal Records and reached Number One in the UK Singles charts on 26 October 1974, and stayed at the top of the charts for three weeks Some scenes in the 1972 film The Harder They Come, were shot at Federal Studios. In 1981, Khouri sold the studio and his business interests to Bob Marley's Tuff Gong Record Label, owned then by Marley's wife Rita, who changed the name from Federal Studios to Tuff Gong Recording Studios.  Legacy  Khouri has been described as a pioneer and visionary. According to Lloyd Bradley (in his Bass Culture book), without Khouri the \\"...new [Jamaican record producing] industry would probably have been stillborn. Ken Khouri was always going to be a central figure: Anyone who had a tune in his head could come to Ken to record it.. ..and get pressed up what ever he thought he could sell.\\" Recording engineer and founder of Island Records, Graeme Goodall said: \\"If there's one common denominator in the whole thing, not as far as the musical content but as far as the whole process [of developing the Jamaican recording industry], that was Ken Khouri, Papa Khouri. Because he was the one who had the foresight to develop the industry, y'know, build the studio, build the pressing plant. He was a very successful Lebanese businessman, but I mean he was the lynchpin of the whole thing.\\"Peter I, \\"Interview with Graeme Goodall, 'Mr. Goody'\\", Reggae- Vibes.com. Retrieved 19 April 2013. In an interview he commented on his lack of recognition in the Jamaican music industry, stating that apart from some non-Jamaicans and a few old associates like Prince Buster or Pluto Shervington: \\"No one ever says thanks... I would rather that you do not say it but I am disappointed, especially with the Government, for not recognizing my contribution.\\" In 2001, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Caribbean Development for the Arts and Culture Foundation, and before his death he was the recipient of the silver Musgrave Medal for his contributions to the music industry. He died in Kingston in 2003, at the age of 86.

Set in Ferrara and in a nearby seaside resort in 1938, the plot follows a Jewish student and a homosexual doctor who suffer persecution in Fascist Italy. The film is an adaptation of Giorgio Bassani's novel The Gold Rimmed Spectacles (Gli occhiali d'oro). It entered the main competition at the 1987 Venice Film Festival, where it won two Golden Osellas for Best Costume Design and Best Set Design. For his soundtrack Ennio Morricone won the David di Donatello for Best Score.  Plot  The corpse of a man, drowned in the river Po, is brought to shore by fishermen. The man's broken gold rimmed glasses lay stuck in the mud next to him. His story is told in flashback. Ferrara, 1938 ‚Äì Doctor Athos Fadigati is a middle age otolaryngologist with a prosperous pediatric practice. Cultured and well off, he belongs to the city's bourgeois society. While walking around town, Dr Fadigati meets Nora, the only daughter of one of his friends. The warmhearted doctor purchases a painting and gives it to Nora as a gift for her ailing father. Nora is the last member of the Treves, a Jewish family whose fortune has fluctuated through the years. Nora is in love with Davide Lattes, a young literature student at the university of Bologna, who dreams of becoming a writer. Davide is also Jewish and lives comfortably with his parents and young sister. Their way of life is threatened as the fascist regime of Mussolini begins to apply antisemitic measures. Davide is worried particularly after one of his university professor is laid off for being Jewish and none came to his defense. Davide's concerns are not shared by his father, who plays down the news of the persecution of Jews in Germany. The father thinks that something similar could not take place in Italy, where the Jewish community has lived undisturbed for centuries. Nora's father dies and her attitude changes as she takes over her father's business deals. She and Davide are very much in love. One night after making love, Nora is able to tell Davide that she loves him for the first time. Davide, as many young students in Ferrara, commutes daily by train to the university in Bologna. Twice a week, the solitary bespectacled Fadigati takes the same train. Eventually the doctor befriends the students, some of which were his patients when they were children. There are rumors around town that the bachelor doctor is homosexual. One of the students, Eraldo, is certain that the doctor is gay and he is sometimes insolent towards Fadigati. Eraldo, an amateur boxer, invites Dr. Fadigati to see him fight. Although he dislikes boxing, the doctor accepts the invitation. At the end of the boxing match, when he goes to greet the young man, Fadigati finds Eraldo taking a shower. Eraldo is ambitious and befriends Fadigati, sharing his confidences with him. Eraldo comes from a humbler background than most of his friends. He was abandoned by his father, who emigrated to America, but has been spoiled by his mother, a housemaid who has worked hard to give him what he wants. Eraldo has never gone on vacation away from Ferrara and Dr Fadigati, smitten with him, invites him to go together to a nearby resort town. At the sea-side resort town in the Adriatic coast, the pairing of Fadigati and Eraldo arouses the malicious gossip of Signora Lavezzoli, an obnoxious but influential member of Ferrara's society. Eraldo quickly leaves the doctor alone to pursue girls. Davide, seeing Eraldo's exploitation of Fadigati and the vengeful attitude of Signora Lavezzoli, takes pity on the doctor. Carlotta, a flirty but well-intentioned friend, accompanies Davide while Nora arrives. At a gala, taking place at the local hotel, Nora is invited to dance by a fascist leader, leaving Davide alone and offended. The same night, Fadigati confronts Eraldo, who makes a scene punching the doctor in the face, leaving him bleeding and humiliated. Back in his hotel room accompanied by Davide, Fadigati discovers that Eraldo has stolen all he could. The scandal at the hotel completely destroys Fadigati's reputation. Back in Ferrara, the fascist regime's grip over the Jewish community tightens. Davide like all Jewish students is expelled from the university. Nora breaks definitely with him; she chooses survival over love. To escape the persecution of the Jews, she decides to convert to Catholicism and to marry her fascist suitor. Davide is left heartbroken. Marked by the scandal, the life of Dr Fadigati has completely collapsed. He is outcast by his former friends and the society of Ferrara turn its back on him. Fired from the clinic where he used to work, Fadigati is morally and economically in ruins. The doctor befriends a street dog, but he is eventually abandoned even by his pet. Only Davide comes to visit the fallen doctor. They make plans for an excursion to the river Po, but it has to be cancelled due to the rain. In spite of the rain Fadigati takes a bus to the shore of the river Po and begins to walk towards his death. A title informs viewers that Nora married her fascist lover and died two years later during childbirth. Eraldo emigrated to France where he started a career as a boxer, but without success. Davide became a well-known writer. Many members of the Jewish community of Ferrara were killed in concentration camps.

Rufus Taylor, Retired CIA Deputy, Dies\\" Obituary in The Washington Post, Sept. 20, 1978. Eventually he became Director of the Office of Naval Intelligence and held the rank of Vice Admiral. In 1966 he was appointed as Deputy Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), then shortly thereafter as Deputy Director of the CIA, where he served from 1966 to 1969. Career overview Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Taylor graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1933. During World War II, he served in the Pacific. For the years 1963 to 1966 he was Director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). In June 1966, he was made Vice Admiral and Deputy Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). That September President Lyndon Baines Johnson appointed him Deputy Director of Central Intelligence at CIA; he was quickly confirmed by the United States Senate. He served at CIA under DCI Richard Helms. Taylor later resigned as DDCI effective February 1969.John Ranelagh, The Agency: The Rise and Decline of the CIA (New York: Simon and Schuster 1978). p. 736. In the Navy Stationed in Japan from 1938 to 1941, he had been sent there by Naval Intelligence to study Japanese. In 1942 he was with an intelligence unit in Corregidor, when the Japanese invaded the Philippines. He was evacuated by motor boat and submarine to Australia. There he joined the staff of the Commander, Allied Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific. In 1943 he was sent to Washington, D.C., to the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI).Working to intercept and decipher Japanese naval codes. Then in Hawaii, he was with Fleet Radio Unit Pacific (FRUPAC), working to decipher enemy naval codes, until the Japanese surrender. He returned to Japan with occupation forces. He then served at sea until 1953. Back in Washington, he was sent to the National Security Agency (NSA). He was then given various assignments in intelligence. In Washington in 1959, he became chief of Pacific Intelligence. In 1963 he was promoted to Director, ONI.George P. McGinnis, U. S. Naval Cryptological Veterans Association (Paducah, KY: Turner Pub.

Among other things, in 1965 he initiated the set up of a secret HUMINT capacity for the Navy. \\"Despite some concern by senior Navy officers about the 'flap potential', the proposal was approved\\" by Paul Nitze, the Secretary of the Navy. Established in 1966, the covert unit was designated the Naval Field Operations Support Group (NFOSG) ‚Äì more commonly known as 'Task Force 157'.Jeffrey T. Richelson, editor, \\"N. S. A.

At CIA The Deputy Director (DDCI) was second in command to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), then the top intelligence officer. In the absence of the DCI the DDCI assumes the Director's responsibilities.W. Thomas Smith, Jr., Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency (New York: Facts on File 2003), p. 72. Below are several rulings made by Taylor which addressed high-level disputes within the Agency. Yuri Nosenko In late 1967, DCI Richard Helms asked Taylor to oversee a difficult, intra-CIA dispute involving Yuri Nosenko, who had defected from Soviet intelligence in 1964. CIA counterintelligence chief James Angleton had almost immediately accused Nosenko of being a double agent and provocateur sent by the Soviets to penetrate American intelligence. As a result of this dilemma Nosenko was held for several years by CIA pending resolution. Taylor conducted his \\"independent review\\" of the \\"immense files\\" and began to interview the CIA officers involved. Finally Taylor concluded that Nosenko was not a double agent and that Helms should set him free.Richard Helms, With a Look over my Shoulder (New York: Random House 2003), Chapter on Nosenko: \\"A Bone in the Throat\\" pp. 238-244, Taylor at 244 (quotes).Tim Weiner, Legacy of Ashes. The History of the CIA (New York: Doubleday 2007), Nosenko pp. 230-235, 276, Taylor at 276. In his exhaustive review Taylor also had relied on an internal CIA report by Bruce Solie of October 1968. Despite strong objections from CIA counterintelligence, in March 1969 Nosenko was released and put on the CIA payroll as a consultant. Angleton, however, kept insisting Nosenko was a counterspy, until in 1974 Angleton resigned from CIA. A further internal CIA report by John Hart in late 1976 confirmed Nosenko's bona fides.Richard J. Heuer, Jr., \\"Nosenko: Five Paths to Judgment\\" in Studies in Intelligence (1987) at 31/3: 71-101; reprinted in H. Bradford Westerfield, editor, Inside CIA's Private World (Yale Univ. 1995) pp. 379‚Äì414, Taylor at 383, 385, Solie at 384, Hart at 385-386. There were six CIA reports in all (p. 384).Edward Jay Epstein, Deception: The Invisible War between the KGB and the CIA (New York: Simon and Schuster 1989), Nosenko as seen by Angleton & counterintelligence: pp. 11‚Äì16, 18‚Äì21, 30, 43‚Äì64, 74‚Äì75, 93‚Äì95.John L. Hart had been CIA Chief of Station in Saigon c.1965-1966. Sam Adams In May 1968, DCI Helms had appointed three top CIA official to a special review board, which was given the case of Sam Adams, a mid-level analyst at CIA. The board was chaired by Taylor and included CIA general counsel, Lawrence Houston, and OSS and CIA veteran John Bross, assistant to the DCI. It was \\"as high level a [board] as could be found within the agency.\\"Richard Helms, With a Look over my Shoulder (2003), p. 327 (quote); 'Order of Battle' dispute pp. 324-329, Sam Adams pp. 326-328. Adams in 1966 had challenged the prevailing view of the number of Viet Cong guerrillas, known as the Order of Battle controversy. The Army's MACV had lower numbers and forcefully asserted its position. These lower numbers were attacked as being the result of a politically motivated effort to present the American war effort in a more positive light. The conflict between the Army officers in the field and CIA analysts in Washington had become a serious concern for the intelligence community. By statute DCI Helms had to arbitrate the dispute. Taking into consideration the prevailing political views of the Johnson Administration, and of the military leaders, in late 1967 Helms finessed it. Adams cried foul at the compromise which favored the lower MACV numbers, and filed a formal complaint against Helms.Harold P. Ford, CIA and the Vietnam Policymakers: Three episodes 1962-1968 (Central Intelligence Agency: Center for the Study of Intelligence 1998), pp. 89-104 (Sam Adams), 85-104, 138-141, 143-152 (O/B controversy). By August 1, 1968, the special review board determined that, although Adams' numbers were probably more accurate, his methodology could not provide certainty.E.g., in part Adams had extrapolated provincial findings to arrive at a country-wide determination. While Adams himself had followed correct CIA procedure re his complaint, the CIA also had given him a fair opportunity to present his case. The board recommended another opportunity be granted Adams: a presentation to General Maxwell Taylor chairman of the PFIAB. That November Adams discussed the situation in person with Helms. Never fully reconciled to Helms' policy stance, Adams resigned from the Agency in 1973.John Ranelagh, The Agency (1986), \\"The politics of numbers\\" pp. 454‚Äì471, Taylor 470, Adams quote 469. Ranelagh opined that the CIA numbers became \\"vindicated\\" (pp. 465-468, 468 quote), but that Helms made the only workable choice (p. 469-471).Thomas Powers, The Man Who Kept the Secrets: Richard Helms and the CIA (New York: Alfred A. Knopt 1979), pp. 214-217, 221‚Äì223; Taylor at pp. 221-222. Powers tells a slightly different story. Nota Bene: Adams starts his memoirs by referring to \\"a letter from Admiral Rufus Taylor, the agency's otherwise kindly deputy director, who intimated that the CIA would be better off without me.\\" As Adams recalls, \\"The letter was Admiral Taylor's last official act\\" at CIA, on January 31, 1969. The letter ends suggesting that Adams \\"submit [his] resignation.\\" Adams instead reflected on troubles at CIA, and \\"the damnedest set of misdeeds that U.S. Intelligence had ever strung together,\\" e.g., the Order of Battle controversy. \\"Despite his letter I had no intentions of quitting. Instead I removed from my dest a manilla folder of classified documents... walked past the guard... and drove home.\\" Adams buried these and other documents, afraid they \\"might vanish\\" at CIA.

This bacteria causes lesions in the vascular endothelium, leading to hemorrhages and petechias at the surface of internal organs. As few as 10 bacterial cells per fish can cause an infection. L. garvieae is isolated in saltwater fish in the Far East and specifically in European Rainbow Trout. Host range Lactococcus garvieae is usually identified within aquatic species. However, it has also been found in subclinical intramammary infections in cows, subclinical mastitis in water buffalos, poultry meat, raw cow's milk, meat products, porcine blood from industrial abattoirs and from cat and dog tonsils. History Lactococcus garvieae was first discovered in rainbow trout raised on a Japanese fish farm in the 1950s. In 1988, L. garvieae was identified in the rainbow trout from Spanish fish farms as well. In later years, L. garvieae was isolated from several septicemic processes in fish and phenotypical and molecular taxonomic studies confirmed the same agent as E. seriolicida. This species was reclassified as a junior synonym of L. garvieae. Culture and morphology Lactococcus garvieae is a facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore forming, Gram-positive ovoid coccus, occurring in pairs and short chains. It can produce Œ±-hemolysis on blood agar (BA). It has the ability to grow at 4-45 ¬∞C in media containing 6.5% sodium chloride (NaCl) at pH 9.6. Its optimal growth temperature is 37 ¬∞C for a 24‚Äëhour period, while at 4 ¬∞C it needs between 12 and 15 days for premium growth. It also grows rapidly in rich media, such as brain heart infusion agar (BHIA), trypticase soy agar (TSA), BA, trypticase soy broth (TSB), and bile esculin agar (BEA). Conversely, L. garvieae does not grow on McConkey agar or Enterococcus agar. Optimum conditions for colony growth exists within brain heart infusion broth (BHIB) where conditions include a pH range of 7-8 and a temperature range of 25-30 ¬∞C. Epidemiology In fish models, all clinical forms of lactococcosis show an absence of clinical symptoms and mortalities in fish weighing under 80 grams. Smaller fish can be infected experimentally. In a follow-up study of the pathogenicity of L. garvieae, younger fish at 50 grams underwent a higher mortality than older fish at about 100 grams and the acute period of the disease was reported to be longer in young fish. Numerous investigations of L. garvieae pathogenicity have confirmed that capsulated strains, commonly classified as serotype KG‚àí, are more virulent than non- capsulated strains, commonly classified as serotype KG+. The appearance of the disease is affected specifically by factors of the aquatic environment such as temperature and water quality. Water temperature affects the disease seasonally as the climate changes, specifically when the water temperature is over . Infection is linked to water temperatures over 18 ¬∞C, although acute outbreaks have been discovered in water temperatures of 14‚Äì15 ¬∞C. Low water quality caused by poor sanitary conditions has been shown to influence evolution of infection. The disease becomes more distinct when the immediate aquatic environment is poor, and oxygen deficiency increases virulence of the agent. Likewise, excessive ammonium concentration causes an increase in mortality of fish. Virulence Several virulence experiments have been performed in order to determine the possible correlation between pathogenicity of L. garvieae in rainbow trout and the two antigenic profiles (KG- and KG+). The results revealed that capsulated strains (KG-) were more virulent than non-capsulated (KG+), showing LD50 values as low as 102 bacteria per fish. The KG‚àí type strain was more virulent than the KG+ because when the surface morphologies of the KG‚àí and KG+ phenotypes were differentiated by scanning electron microscopy, KG‚àí cells were found to be more hydrophilic than KG+ cells. The immune response of Japanese yellowtail following injection of the two phenotypes varied with higher adhering titers in the KG+ phenotype compared to the KG-. Successively, 24 isolates of L. garvieae from different fish species and geographic origin were studied by slide cohesion tests. These tests were conducted using rabbit antisera against representative strains with diverse origins and by Dot blot assays. These results endorsed the establishment of two different groups of isolates, but a correlation between serological group and geographic origin or host source could not be determined. Barnes and Ellis serologically compared 17 geographically distinct strains of L. garvieae isolated from diseased rainbow trout, finding that sera raised against capsule deficient isolates did not agglutinate capsulated isolates, whereas all antisera against capsulated strains cross reacted with non-capsulated isolates. The results determine that L. garvieae can be differentiated serologically into three different serotypes: a European capsulated serotype, a Japanese capsulated serotype and a non-capsulated serotype from both the European and Japanese regions. The comparative analysis of genomes of a virulent strain Lg2 (KG-) and a non-virulent strain ATCC 49156 (KG+) of L. garvieae revealed that the two strains shared a high degree of sequence identity, but Lg2 had a 16.5-kb capsule gene cluster that is absent in ATCC 49156. The capsule gene cluster of Lg2 may be a genomic island from several features such as the presence of insertion sequences flanked on both ends, different GC content from the chromosomal average, integration into the locus syntenic to other lactococcal genome sequences, and distribution in human gut microbiomes. Signs and symptoms in fish In fish, the incubation period of L. garvieae is very brief and the microorganism performs with high virulence. In an experimental infection by intraperitoneal route in Japanese yellowtail, it caused symptoms 2‚Äì3 days post-inoculation, while intramuscular infection in grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) produced its first symptoms and fatalities two days post-inoculation. Correspondingly, intraperitoneal experimental infection in rainbow trout caused the first symptoms and deaths three days post-inoculation. The gross pathology of lactococcosis arises with the presence of a rapid and general anorexia, melanosis, lethargy, loss of orientation, and irregular swimming. Typical external symptoms include exophthalmia and the presence of hemorrhages in the periorbital and intraocular area, the base of fins, the perianal region, the opercula and the buccal region. In further studies, swollen abdomens and anal prolapsus have been observed. Due to infection, fish have produced lesions in the vascular endothelium that cause blood extravasation, leading to hemorrhages and petechiae at the surface of internal organs. The main organs affected are the spleen, liver, brain, stomach, kidney and heart. Macroscopic lesions in affected fish are typical of an acute systemic disease with strong congestion in the internal organs and different levels of hemorrhages in the swim bladder, intestine, liver, peritoneum, spleen and kidney. Also, enlargement of the spleen, focal areas of necrosis in the liver and spleen, pericarditis, hemorrhagic fluid in the intestine, and yellowish exudate covering the brain surface are typically observed. Histopathology is found mainly in the eyes and internal organs‚Äô capsules. Lesions on the ocular area consist of extensive fibroplasias with inflammatory cells penetration. In the brain, lesions exist in the cerebrum and cerebellum. Diseased fish typically show signs of acute meningitis, consisting of an exudate covering the brain surface. In the heart, lesions are usually signified by fibroplasias, macrophage, and lymphocyte. In kidneys, the renal tubules have hyaline droplet deposition in the epithelia and hyaline casts in the lumen. World impact of fish infection According to a series of studies in 2006, L. garvieae is an emerging pathogen which is causing significant economic losses both in marine and freshwater aquaculture when water temperature increases over 16 ¬∞C in summer months. This pathogen causes serious economic losses due to three main factors: elevated rates of mortality have been investigated at 50% of fish, a decrease in the growing rates of fish due to infection, and unpleasant appearance of the infected fish which makes them unmarketable to consumers. Human pathogen Lactococcus garvieae in humans is a rare pathogen and of low virulence. More than 31 cases of infection in humans have been reported. These include 25 cases of endocarditis and other infections like those related to peritoneal dialysis catheters, discitis, catheter associated UTI, post TURP infection, liver abscess in a patient with cholangiocarcinoma, AICD/Pacemaker related infections to name a few. The signs and symptoms of United States cases ranges from urinary tract, blood, skin and pneumonic processes. In Canada, patients have been found with bacterial endocarditis. It is speculated that the infection followed the consumption of fresh seafood and is believed to be facilitated by immunosuppression or liver cirrhosis. A patient with L. garvieae septicaemia in absence of infective endocarditis was successfully treated with a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin and showed a favorable clinical course. Antibiotic therapy adapted to the antibiogram (levofloxacin, amoxicillin, and Clavulanic acid) for eight weeks and an oral anticoagulative therapy for three months. Bacterial endocarditis from L. garvieae is extremely rare and may actually be underreported due to its morphologic and biochemical similarities with enterococci. The source of infection in many L. garvieae infected patients is unclear, where similar cases were identified and patients denied having contact with domestic animals or fish, or eating raw fish, milk or meat and dairy products. However, a few cases had known diverticulitis of the colon, which could provide a point of entry for L. garvieae infection.

The episode was written by George R. R. Martin, the author of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels on which the series is based, and was directed by Michelle MacLaren, her directorial debut for the series. The plot of the episode advances the storylines of Daenerys's arrival to the city of Yunkai, the repercussions of the upcoming marriage of Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark, and Brienne's fate at the ruined castle of Harrenhal. The title of the episode refers to \\"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\\", a popular song among commoners and noblemen within the series' universe, which had been introduced four episodes earlier. In this episode, it refers to Brienne of Tarth (the maiden fair) facing a real bear. Plot In King's Landing Sansa is comforted by Margaery, who has heard of Sansa's betrothal to Tyrion. Elsewhere, Tyrion and Bronn discuss the match and how it will affect Shae. Tywin meets with Joffrey. Joffrey asks what they should do about the rumors of Daenerys and her dragons, but Tywin claims there is no threat. On Blackwater Bay, Melisandre reveals to Gendry that his father was King Robert Baratheon. In the North Jon and the wildling party continue their journey south. Soon after, Orell speaks to Ygritte, confessing his love for her and trying to convince her that Jon is still loyal to the Night's Watch. Later, Jon tells Ygritte that the wildling cause is hopeless, but she remains undaunted. Theon is freed from his constraints by two young women. They begin pleasuring him. The three are soon interrupted by his tormenter, who had ordered the women to seduce Theon in order to torment him further. The boy mocks Theon's sexual prowess, before ordering his men to restrain Theon as he removes Theon's genitals. Heading for the Wall, Osha continues to grow suspicious of the Reeds, calling Jojen's visions \\"black magic\\". When she says they have to continue to the Wall, Jojen reveals that the three-eyed raven is north of the Wall. Osha refuses to allow them to go north of the Wall, relating to them the story of her husband's death and resurrection as a wight. In the Riverlands Robb, his advisors, and his army are delayed by rain in their march toward the Twins for Edmure's wedding to Roslin Frey. Catelyn and the Blackfish discuss their distaste for Walder Frey, who will see their delay and Robb's oath-breaking as slights against his family. Talisa reveals to Robb that she is pregnant. At the Brotherhood's hideout, Arya berates Beric and Thoros for selling Gendry to Melisandre. When Anguy tells Beric of a Lannister raiding party near them, Beric orders the men to move out in pursuit. Arya calls Beric a liar, as he promised to take her to Riverrun. She runs away and is taken captive by the Hound. Outside Yunkai Daenerys, Jorah, Barristan, and the Unsullied reach Yunkai. Daenerys tells Jorah she will take the city to free its 200,000 slaves. An envoy, Razdal mo Eraz, is sent by Yunkai to offer terms of peace, which include chests filled with gold bars and as many ships as Daenerys wants. Daenerys refuses his offer, demanding the slaves of the city be freed and paid for their service or she will attack the city. At Harrenhal Jaime visits Brienne in her cell. He tells her that he will be leaving for King's Landing the next day. Before Jaime leaves, Brienne makes him swear to uphold his oath to Catelyn and return the Stark girls to their mother. As he leaves, Jaime dryly tells Roose to tell Robb that \\"the Lannisters send their regards\\". When Qyburn informs Jaime that Brienne will not be ransomed by Locke, Jaime manipulates the party leader, Steelshanks, to order their return to Harrenhal. Upon their arrival, Jaime finds that Brienne has been thrown into a pit by Locke and his men, and has been forced to fight a grizzly bear while armed only with a wooden sword. Jaime leaps into the pit to protect her. Jaime boosts Brienne out of the pit, and is then lifted to safety. Production Writing George R. R. Martin, author of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, scripts one episode per season. The episode was written by George R. R. Martin, author of the novels of the A Song of Ice and Fire saga that the show adapts. \\"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\\" is based on material from the third book of his series, A Storm of Swords, adapting chapters 42 to 46 (Jon V, Daenerys IV, Arya VIII, Jaime VI and Catelyn V). In some of the scenes, Martin had to take into account the changes done by the production to some of his original plots or characters, writing scenes that could never happen in the novels: the books have Talisa's counterpart stay in Riverrun instead of following Robb, Melisandre never interacts with Gendry, and Sansa does not get to confide with Margaery. Martin initially titled the episode \\"Autumn Storms\\", because it was supposed to be raining in many of the scenes. When he was forced to change it because most of the rains had been cut from his script in pre-production, he came up with the title \\"Chains\\", that worked both in a literal and metaphorical level. However, later on, the final scene including the bear that had been originally written by showrunners Benioff and Weiss for the next episode was incorporated, and the episode was given its final title. Casting To play the part of the bear at Harrenhal, the producers chose the nearly nine-foot-tall Alaskan brown bear Bart the Bear 2 (a.k.a. \\"Little Bart\\"), who was born in 2000 and trained by Doug and Lynne Seus (the same trainers of his well-known predecessor, the original Bart the Bear). Filming locations The episode introduces Yunkai, based on the Moroccan city of A√Øt Benhaddou. The production continued to use Morocco to depict the Slaver's Bay. While the coastal city of Essaouira had doubled as Astapor, this episode used the city of A√Øt Benhaddou (near Ouarzazate) to depict Yunkai. Daenerys's camp was built in the nearby location of Little Barrage. The scenes with Jon Snow and the wildlings were filmed in the forests around Toome, in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed six weeks before the production moved to Iceland to film several scenes for the previous episodes. Due to the legal restrictions and the difficulties involved in the transport of large animals, the scenes with the bear Little Bart had to be filmed in the USA. Although it was only used for a single scene, this was the fifth country where the production filmed during the season (after Northern Ireland, Morocco, Croatia, and Iceland). The actual bear-pit set was built in Northern Ireland: the bear was filmed where it was living in Los Angeles, interacting with its trainer, and was later digitally added into the footage from the bear pit set in Northern Ireland. Reception Ratings 4.84 million viewers watched the premiere airing of \\"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\\", a decrease of 0.67 million compared to the previous week. This ended the streak set during the four previous episodes, each of which established a new series high in ratings. 1.12 million people watched the second airing, bringing the total viewership of the night to 5.96 million. In the United Kingdom, the episode was seen by 1.023 million viewers on Sky Atlantic, being the channel's highest-rated broadcast that week. Critical reception The critical reception to the episode was generally favorable, although most commentators agreed that it was not among the best episodes of the third season, or the ones written by Martin. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 21 reviews of the episode and judged 81% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.05 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"'The Bear and the Maiden Fair\\" feels like a bit of a holding pattern as Game of Thrones moves its pieces into place for the final three episodes.\\" The quality of the dialogue and characterization was widely praised. The A.V. Clubs David Sims found that the interactions felt more natural, and Elio Garcia from Westeros.org suggested that the characters \\"oozed a richer version of themselves\\". Another aspect that was mentioned as an improvement was the treatment of the romantic relationships. Many reviews signaled the lack of focus as the main flaw of the episode, although they agreed that the story required preparing the stage for the final part of the season: Emily VanDerWerff wrote at The A.V. Club that it was a \\"somewhat disjointed hour, full of characters moving into place for what‚Äôs next (...) it nonetheless accomplishes what it sets out to do\\". According to Myles McNutt from Cultural Learnings, the episode \\"never evolves into a particularly exciting hour of television, content mostly to sketch out the boundaries of the season‚Äôs storylines in preparation for the oncoming climax.\\" The final scene, where Brienne is forced to fight a bear, was very well received: IGN's Matt Fowler called it \\"a spectacular moment\\", HitFix's Alan Sepinwall deemed it \\"gorgeously staged and executed\\", and David Sims found it \\"tense, thrilling television\\". Other scenes that were highlighted were the parley between Daenerys and the slaver, and the confrontation between Tywin and Joffrey. In the latter, the camera work used by director Michelle MacLaren was lauded. In contrast, the scene featuring Theon's torture was criticized for what was seen as its gratuitous violence and nudity, and for the repetitiveness of the storyline over the season. Sepinwall declared that he had no need \\"to witness more of The Passion of the Greyjoy\\", and Sims considered it \\"boring and confusing to watch\\". VanDerWerff concluded: \\"Endless torture sequences don‚Äôt make for terribly exciting fiction, and that‚Äôs more or less bearing out here.\\" On the other end of the spectrum, the reviewer for Time, James Poniewozik, considered it \\"chilling\\".

They are often installed without a chimney. Ethanol for these fires is often marketed as bioethanol (ethanol produced from biomass). A simple glass ethanol burner or spirit lamp The main part of the fireplace is the burner. The burner is a container filled with fuel. Ethanol fireplaces should be operated with care, since ethanol is highly flammable,Ethanol fireplaces: The underestimated risk. Science Daily (3 September 2014)Warning About Use of Bio Ethanol Fuel . Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service and severe burn accidents can happen, mostly while refilling or lighting the fireplace, even when safety instructions are followed. Emissions from ethanol fireplaces include carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and particulate emissions, which are released into the room. Ethanol fireplaces ‚Äî irrespective of the type of fuel used ‚Äî are a source of fine and ultrafine particles and have a considerable influence on the quality of the indoor air; ventilation reduces the effect. Ethanol may also generate odors. Burning hydrocarbons causes indoor air pollution. Emissions include airborne particulate matter (such as black carbon) and nitrogen oxides. These harm health; some forms of fuel are more harmful than others.  Types  Ethanol fireplaces are available in several different designs. There are manual ethanol fireplaces and automatic ethanol fireplaces. Automatic ethanol fireplace flames have no direct user contact with fuel. Fuel is in stored in a reservoir and then heated until the alcohol evaporates into the burner. These vapors are then ignited by a spark system in the unit. User can turn the flames on or off as well as regulate the flame size with a remote control, mobile app or smart home system. A microprocessor controls burning process, using numerous sensors to keep burning parameters stable. If the sensors detect any issues ‚Äî such as an earth quake, low oxygen or excessively high temperatures ‚Äî they will extinguish the flame. Wall mounted designs can be built into a drywall wall or be recessed into the wall. Free standing or stand-alone ethanol fireplaces are portable, and can be used in any architectural setting. Table-top ethanol fireplaces are the smallest versions of ethanol fireplaces and are often used as a decoration.

For over twenty-five years he was a leader of the Cook County Democrats and for eight years represented his state on the national committee of his party. As president of the Ogden Gas Company he held a high place in the business world.Centennial history of the city of Chicago. Its men and institutions. Biographical sketches of leading citizens. (1905) pp.242-243. Life Gahan was born in what is now known as Arlington Heights, Cook County, April 7, 1847. His first public position was that of captain of police in the old town of Lake, in which position he won distinction by imposing law and order. This was especially true during the great strike of 1884. Through his police connection he drifted into politics, organizing the Democracy of the town of Lake. He brought about the nomination of the late Julius S. Grinnell for state's attorney, who was the only democrat on the ticket to be elected. When the town of Lake was annexed to the City of Chicago he was elected alderman to represent the new ward, the Twenty-ninth, having- served several terms as supervisor before annexation. Gahan served in the city council from 1889 to 1893, when he resigned to become railroad and warehouse commissioner under Governor Altgeld, whose nomination and election he had been instrumental in securing. In 1896 he was elected a member of the Democratic National Committee for Illinois and re- elected in 1900. Ill health prevented his acceptance of the honor in 1904. He also served as chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party from 1895 to 1902. He was elected delegate to each Democratic national convention from 1884 to 1904, inclusive. In politics Gahan was a power. He secured the nomination and election of such men as Governor Altgeld, Mayor Hopkins, of whom lie was a close friend and adviser, and many others. He exerted a large influence in state and national politics, taking an active part in every campaign from the Cleveland-Elaine struggle in 1884 to the McKinley-Bryan campaign in 1900. His business career was marked by the same success as attended his political endeavors. He was associated with Thomas Byrne for many years in general contracting business, during which time they built three sections of the drainage canal, the Robey Street sewer and all the underground work at the Columbian Exposition. Saturday evening, April 29, 1905, Gahan contracted an acute attack of Bright's disease, with which he had been ailing for two years. His condition rapidly became worse and the following evening he succumbed at his residence, 4619 Grand boulevard. Gahan was a member of the Sheridan, Cook County, Ellerslee Cross Country, and Iroquois clubs, and of the Knights of Columbus. He was a liberal and silent giver to charity and always evinced a deep interest in the schools of Chicago. He was married November 8, 1877 to Miss Sarah A. McNarney, who survives him, together with his daughters, Sarah, Olive, Agnes and Rose.Centennial history of the city of Chicago. Its men and institutions. Biographical sketches of leading citizens.

Note the streetcars and station in front. Opening ceremony for the city's first electric streetcar line Mexico City once had an extensive network of streetcars. Most streetcar lines in Mexico City radiated from the city's central square, the Z√≥calo towards many parts of the city. By the 1980s only one streetcar line survived, which itself was converted into the Xochimilco Light Rail line in 1986.  History  At the beginning of the 19th century, Mexico City was in need of new means of transportation. Since the 1830s efforts had been made to build a railway. In 1840, 1849, and 1959, various concessions were granted to build a permanent urban railway without any result. In 1856, an American Texan, George Louis Hammeken, was granted a concession to build an animal-powered street railway from the Z√≥calo, Mexico City's central square, to Tacubaya, now in the west-central part of the city. The Ferrocarril de Tacubaya opened on January 1, 1858. July 4, 1858, president Ignacio Comonfort opened the first railway line between Mexico City and Villa Guadalupe (La Villa). In 1868 the \\"Ferrocarril de Chalco\\" opened a second street railway to Tacubaya along Avenida Chapultepec. This network was extended to San √Ångel and Tlalpan in 1869; however it never was extended to the line's namesake town of Chalco. The Ferrocarril de Tacubaya opened a second line to Popotla, near the Calzada M√©xico-Tacuba (Tacuba causeway). After these initial lines, different companies were created for the exploitation of street railways. The Compa√±√≠a de Ferrocarriles del Distrito Federal, organized in 1878, began to install lines for animal-powered street railways including one in the Calzada de Tlalpan (Tlalpan Causeway), and controlled street railway lines until 1901. In 1882 it was reorganized and absorbed a large part of the street railway network in the city. In 1890 that company had 3000 mules, 600 cars, and of rail line. Lines ran north as far as Tlalnepantla, as far south as Tlalpan, as far east as Pe√±√≥n de los Ba√±os.  Electric streetcars  In 1896 the then- municipal government of Mexico City (the Ayuntamiento de M√©xico) authorized the Federal District Railways to change from animal to electric power. This order did not result in an immediate switch, because an analysis needed to be performed of the benefits and issues that switching would cause. The advantages of switching to electric included: * Better conservation of the street paving * Shorter trip times * Increased frequency The Servicio de Transportes El√©ctricos (STE; translates as \\"Electric Transport Service\\") was organized in 1947, to replace the privately run Compa√±√≠a de Tranv√≠as de M√©xico (\\"Street Railway Company of Mexico\\"). January 15, 1900, was the first day of electric streetcar service between Chapultepec and Tacubaya. Animal-powered street railways would continue to operate in the city along with electric streetcars for another thirty years. March 1, 1901, the Compa√±√≠a de Tranv√≠as El√©ctricos de M√©xico took ownership of the city's street railway network. In 1909 the first phase of the Necaxa Dam was completed, which allowed an expansion of the streetcar network.  Decline  The \\"Cerito\\" streetcar. It served the \\"Historic Circuit\\" tourist route created in 1971. February 21, 1953, two cars crashed on the La Venta line, which closed and never was reopened. STE also closed the Coyoac√°n, Iztapalapa, Lerdo and Tizap√°n lines. In 1969, Mexico City Metro Line 1 opened, which replaced the streetcar line along Avenida Chapultepec. In 1970, Mexico City Metro Line 2 opened, replacing the northern part of the Xochimilco streetcar line. By 1976 the streetcar network measured , consisting of only 3 lines, due to the construction of the ejes viales, a grid of designated thoroughfares across the city, in conjunction with which it was decided to build new lines for trolleybuses rather than streetcars.  Conversion of last streetcar line to light rail  The last remaining streetcar line, Tasque√±a‚ÄìXochimilco, operated with PCC cars until 1984. During the 1985 Mexico City earthquake many cars were damaged. This system was upgraded to a modern light rail system, the Xochimilco Light Rail line, which opened in stages between 1986 and 1988.

Early years Lusinga was born around 1840 in \\"Buluba\\", the lands to the northeast of Lubanda that were inhabited by the eastern Luba people. He came from the Sanga (\\"Bushpig\\") clan. At some time Lusinga seems to have visited Unyanyembe, near Tabora in modern Tanzania, where he realized the value that was attached to slaves and ivory. He obtained muskets, or armed retainers, and was the first to use firearms in the region west of the lake. With this superior weaponry he quickly defeated the chiefs in the region of Cape Tembwe, a key point for the trade crossing Lake Tanganyika, and settled there in a fortified village. After reducing the local population by his slaving activity, and under pressure from other slavers, he moved to a new base two days walk from Lubanda in the Mugandja mountains, on the Muswe tributary of the Lufuko River. By the end of his career, Lusinga had sixty wives. These provided a useful labor force for agricultural work, giving Lusinga increased wealth. Contact with Europeans The British explorer Joseph Thomson met Lusinga in 1879. He described him as a \\"sanguinary potentate\\" due to the ruthlessness with which he captured slaves for the East African trade. The Belgian soldier √âmile Storms was given the task of establishing a Belgian base on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika. He reached Mompara on the west shore of the lake in April 1883. He met the chief Mpala, who gave permission to build the post in his territory. On 4 May 1883 the foundations of the station of Mpala were laid. Chief Mpala and Storms became blood-brothers in a ceremony on 25 June 1883. Lusinga was present at this ceremony. To consolidate his power in the region, during 1884 and 1885 Storms made a series of attacks on Lusinga and his supporters. He pillaged their villages and took the loot back to his fort at Mpala, where some of it was lost when the fort burned down. In November 1884, while in Karema, Storms heard that Lusinga was preparing to make war on Mpala. Storms dispatched a force of his men and men from Paul Reichard's expedition to defeat Lusinga. They managed to bluff their way into Lusinga's fortress, where they shot him and took his head, which is held in the Museum of Natural Sciences of Belgium. Legacy Storms replaced Lusinga as chief by Ukala the Nyamwezi, one of Storms' allies. Storms collected a standing figure of Lusinga during a raid on his village in 1884. The figure, in the Luba style, is designed to display his new royal status. It is held in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. Storms also brought Lusinga's skull to Europe when he returned, and gave it to the anthropologist √âmile Houz√©, who wrote a treatise on the subject in which he saw \\"degeneracy\\" in the skull.

As of 2013 services are primarily operated by Ipswich Buses and First Norfolk & Suffolk, although other smaller operators, such as Galloway European, Carters Coaches and Beestons, operate routes from the town into the surrounding rural area. Many of the current routes are based on those established at the end of the 19th century when a horse tram network developed.  History   Horse Trams (1880-1903)  The first ever network of public transport in Ipswich was one of horse trams. The proposal was accepted by the Board of Trade in 1879 and on 13 October 1880, the first line between Cornhill and the railway station opened, using 2 trams, drawn by only one horse each. The two trams were made in Birkenhead, were painted in a brown and cream livery and each carried up to 18 seated passengers. New routes soon opened: Princes Street to Brooks Hall Road in 1881, Cornhill to Barrack Corner in 1882 and Majors Corner to Derby Road railway station in 1883. In an Act of Parliament in 1881 the business was named the Ipswich Tramway Company. By 1884, the fleet had expanded up to 6 single-deck and 2 double-deck trams, pulled by a total of 18 horses. Trams were stored at Quadling Street since the beginning of the tramway and the Ipswich Transport Company continued to keep them there throughout the tramway's lifetime. The network did not expand further in any way, except for the conversion of 3 single-deck trams to double deck, and in 1901 the company was sold to the Ipswich Corporation, who continued to run the horse trams until 6 June 1903, when the network was closed for conversion to electric trams. = Ipswich Omnibus Service rivalry = In 1898, a rival transport operator, the Ipswich Omnibus Society, appeared operating 18 buses in a red livery operated a Bramford Road - Wherstead service, to compete with the trams. Like the trams, the buses were horse drawn, however they operated a '1d all the way' fare in order to take business away from the trams. This forced the Ipswich Tramway Company to lower their fares, however the buses still had an advantage over the trams: they operated on Sundays. The bus network expanded, doubling the trams' routes and serving areas not served by trams. Buses were stored on Kemball Street, off Foxhall Road. When the tram network ceased operations in June 1903 for the conversion to electric trams, the buses continued operating and took over all of the business, however when the new electric tram network opened, the buses were no longer viable and the Ipswich Omnibus Service ceased all operations by the end of 1903.  Electric Trams (1903 - 1926)  Over 5 months, almost 11 miles of track was laid and electric lines were hung, ready for the trial run to Whitton, then a village, on 10 November 1903. A site on Constantine Road, then a marshy area, was bought and a depot, alongside new offices, was erected by the Ipswich Corporation for the new fleet of 26 double-deck electric trams. They wore a livery of dark green and cream and seated 50 passengers: 24 on the top and 26 on the bottom. On 21 November 1903, the first fare-paying passengers were carried on the route from Bourne Bridge to Whitton. Within a month, routes along Spring Road to the Lattice Barn pub and along Bramford Road were opened. The expansion of the network, giving passengers a faster service, forced the Ipswich Omnibus Service to close down by the end of the year. In early 1904, a route from Vernon Street to Princes Street via St Peters Street was opened and in May a route along Felixstowe Road was completed. The tram network did not expand further and in 1924 the decision was made by the Council to convert to trolleybuses, instead of refurbishing all of the track. An Act of Parliament in 1925, allowed the Ipswich Corporation to convert service to trolleybuses and on 26 July 1926 all tram operations ceased. = Princes Street derailment = On the first day of public operations, at 3.40pm, car no. 20, operating a Wherstead Road - Railway Station service, derailed at a set of points at the top of Princes Street. The derailed car blocked the entire street, causing a back-up of traffic. After failed attempts at getting the car back onto the tracks, car no. 8 was used to help, however these attempts failed as well. The car was emptied and passengers transferred to car no. 8. Within a half hour of the accident, 9 trams were backing up around the Cornhill area. Eventually, car no. 24 was deployed to help with car no. 20 and together with car no.8, the derailed tram was brought back onto the tracks. The whole event caused much excitement to the public and many were watching the scene.  Eastern Counties (1919 - current) Brothers Walter and Thomas Wolsey, noticed a gap in the market being the lack of any longer-distance motorbus services, except for one service to Shotley operated by the Great Eastern Railway. They visited Ipswich in order to explore the possibility, having previously been involved in motorbus operations in London and Brighton, and convinced Thomas Tilling Ltd. from Brighton to send four buses, which began operations in June 1919. After two months of experimental operations, the Eastern Counties Road Company (ECRC) was formed and took over all services from the Wolsey Brothers on 1 September 1919. 16 Tilling Stevens TS3 petrol electric buses were deployed by the ECRC for operations. The network soon expanded, which lead to a new base being set up at Bury St. Edmunds. 24 more buses were delivered from Thomas Tilling both from London and Brighton to form a fleet of forty vehicles. In April 1922, Great Eastern Railway's Shotley service was taken over, however the existing buses used on that route were moved to Thames Valley Traction. To compete with the ECRC's services, small operators appeared, most notably Beestons and Partridges, the former of which operates bus services around Ipswich to this day. Except for the take over of the Shotley service, in 1925, the ECRC took over R. A. Moore of Aldeburgh and by the end of 1926, had a fleet of 70 vehicles. In 1928 more take overs continued: A. Quantrill of Kesgrave and Felixstowe Motor Services with W. V. Edmonds of Shotley and Swiftsure Bus Company of Ipswich in 1929. A further two motorbus operators were taken over in 1930. The Transport Act 1930 began regulating bus services and the ECRC was merged, together with the Ortona Motor Company of Cambridge, Peterborough Electric Traction Company and the East Anglia division of United Automobile Services into one company, the Eastern Counties Omnibus Company. By the time of the merger, ECRC had built up a fleet of 131 vehicles, primarily made by Tilling Stevens. The new company continued to absorb many companies, in the fashion of the ECRC. The bus network around Ipswich had not had any significant changes until the Transport Act 1968, when all bus companies were taken over by the National Bus Company (NBC).  Trolleybuses (1923 - 1963)  The first trolleybus service in Ipswich was a trial service taking over the Cornhill - Rail Station route from the trams. The trolleybuses were operated by the Ipswich Corporation, initially with 3 hired single-deck vehicles. They used the existing overhead lines and were initially dubbed for marketing purposes 'Trackless Trams'. 1924 saw the delivery of another 2 trolleybuses and in 1926 the 5 vehicles were bought and another 30 delivered, in replacement of the electric trams. Half of those were built in Ipswich, by Ransomes, and the remaining half in Leiston, by Garratts. 15 more trolleybuses arrived in the following few years. In 1933 a rapid expansion of the network took place. Double decker trolleybuses were delivered, made once again by Ransomes, and a new depot was constructed at Priory Heath in 1937. Within another 3 years, 41 double-deckers were in operation. After the war in 1948 and 1950 yet more trolleybuses were put into operation, however also in 1948, after the electricity supply for the network was nationalised, Richard Chandler, the traffic manager, decided to test out new routes using motor buses, to see if a trolleybus service was viable, prior to the expense of putting up overhead lines. These routes were to the Whitehouse and Maidenhall estates. Trolleybuses were never introduced on those routes, due to the motor buses having more flexibility and the decision was made after the 1950 delivery of trolleybuses, to replace the network with motor buses. The last single deck trolleybus was replaced in 1953 and over the following 10 years, gradually more and more motor buses were delivered and eventually replaced all trolleybuses on 23 August 1963.  Ipswich Motorbuses (1950 - 1986)  Despite Ipswich being one of the first towns to convert to trolleybus operations, it was one of the last to convert to motor bus operations. The first motor buses entered service in August 1950 as trial services, for the future conversion to trolleybuses, to the new council estates at Whitehouse and Maidenhall. 6 double-deck AEC Regents were used initially, however due to trolleybus operation costs rising, the decision was made to gradually cease trolleybus operations. Over the following decade another 51 motor buses were ordered and put into service, replacing trolleybuses in 1963. By 1966, the fleet was at 67 motor buses, 13 of which single deck. After 1968, new buses were mostly Leyland Atlanteans with rear engines and front entrances to allow for the driver to collect the fares, in order to reduce operating costs. After 1983, mostly single deck buses were bought and 25 buses made by Dennis were delivered by 1986. After deregulation, because of the Transport Act 1985, and on 26 October 1986, Ipswich Buses Ltd. was formed.  Current operations  After the deregulation of bus services in 1986, Ipswich Borough Council took over ownership of Ipswich Motorbuses and renamed it Ipswich Buses Limited. In 1988, Bickers of Coddenham was taken over and in 1989, the same happened with Squirrells of Hitcham. The two companies' rural networks were branded 'Suffolkbus' by Ipswich Buses and the routes continue to operate in 2013, although many of them are no longer operated by Ipswich Buses. In 1994, Mainline of Sheffield planned to operate buses over 10 of the routes already operated by Ipswich Buses. The plan did not go ahead and the buses were sold to First Eastern Counties, who jointly operated the town network with Ipswich Buses. This arrangement continued until October 2000. After that, First Eastern Counties continued operating 2 town routes, to Greenwich and to Bixley, while Ipswich Buses operated all other routes. 2000 saw a decision to return to double deck buses and several low-floor double-deck buses were acquired. After an unsuccessful trial of powering a Metrorider by gas in 1995, a further attempt took place on an Optare Solo in 2005. The bus was not used frequently until 2007, when it was decided to convert the bus back to diesel. Routes are also operated by First Norfolk & Suffolk as well as by a number of smaller operators.  Bus stations  Ipswich has two bus stations, Tower Ramparts and Old Cattle Market. All town services depart from Tower Ramparts with services to surrounding towns and villages departing from the Old Cattle Market. Both bus stations were redeveloped in 2013 to improve passenger services. The Old Cattle Market was due to be completed in August 2013, however due to underground piping, the completion of the bus station was delayed until October.Ipswich Old Cattle Market bus station to get revamp, BBC Suffolk news website, 2013-04-29. Retrieved 2013-08-14. Since the rebuilding of the Old Cattle Market bus station National Express coach services use the bus stops on Quadling Street at Cardinal Park, near the town centre.  Routes  Town bus routes generally run from the centre of the town to serve suburban areas, including locations such as Kesgrave and BT's Adastral Park research centre at Martlesham Heath. Some services to locations outside the town include stops along main routes in or out of the urban area. Destinations outside the town include surrounding towns and villages such as Woodbridge as well as more distant locations such as Felixstowe, Colchester and Stowmarket. A free shuttle service also operates around the town centre.Ipswich Shuttle Bus , Suffolk On Board. Retrieved 2013-08-14.

The park and ride service was taken over by First Group in June of 2017. Coach services Ipswich is served by a number of National Express coach services. As of 2013 these link the town directly to locations such as Stansted Airport, Heathrow Airport, London, Clacton-on-Sea, Colchester, Birmingham and Liverpool.

Early life Richmond was born on 10 May 1902 in Rochdale, Lancashire, England. He was one half of twin boys. He was educated at Ruthin School, a public school in Ruthin, Denbighshire, Wales. In 1920, he began the study of classics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He achieved a third class in Mods in 1922 and a second class in Greats in 1924 of his Literae Humaniores degree. He spent the next two years studying at the British School at Rome. Academic career In 1926, following his studies, Richmond joined Queen's University Belfast as a lecturer in Classical Archaeology and Ancient History. In 1930, he returned to Rome as Director of the British School. On leaving Rome in 1935, he became a lecturer in Roman-British studies at Durham University's King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne. He was promoted to Reader in 1943 and to professor in 1950. He was Public Orator for Durham University from 1949 to 1951. In 1956, he was invited to fill the new chair of the Archaeology of the Roman Empire at Oxford. He was a prolific excavator of Romano-British sites, specialising in small-scale excavations, often just a single trench placed at a crucial point in a Roman fort which thereby established both the date and purpose of the fort. He excavated at Segontium in Caernarfon, Chester, South Shields, Lancaster, Bath, Silchester, Inveresk Roman Fort and Chedworth Roman villa. However his two major projects were at the Hod HillHod Hill: Excavations carried out between 1951 and 1958 for the Trustees of the British Museum, British Museum Iron Age hillfort where he elucidated the Roman fort that was inserted into one corner, and then at InchtuthilL.F.Pitts, J.K.St Joseph.

The Holocaust in Albania consisted of crimes committed against Jews in Greater Albania by German, Italian, and Albanian collaborationist forces while Albania was under Italian and German occupation during World War II. Throughout the war, nearly 2,000 Jews sought refuge in Albania-proper. Most of these Jewish refugees were treated well by the local population, despite the fact that Albania-proper was occupied first by Fascist Italy, and then by Nazi Germany. Albanians often sheltered Jewish refugees in mountain villages and transported them to Adriatic ports from where they fled to Italy. Other Jews joined resistance movements throughout the country. For the 500 Jews who lived in Kosovo, the experience was starkly different, and about 40 percent did not survive the war. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, Germany occupied Greater Albania. In 1944, an Albanian Waffen-SS division was formed, which arrested and handed over to the Germans a further 281 Jews from Kosovo who were subsequently deported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed. In late 1944, the Germans were driven out of Albania-proper and the country became a communist state under the leadership of Enver Hoxha. Around the same time, Axis forces in the Albanian-annexed regions of Kosovo and western Macedonia were defeated by the Yugoslav Partisans, who subsequently reincorporated these areas into Yugoslavia. Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Greater Albania during the Holocaust. In Albania-proper, five Jews from the same family were killed by the Germans, the only native Jews to be killed there over the course of the war. Albania-proper emerged from the war with a population of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel. Several hundred remained in Albania until the fall of Communism in the early 1990s before doing the same. There is no academic consensus as to why Jewish survival rates in Albania-proper differed so drastically from those in Kosovo. Some scholars have argued that the traditional code of honour known as besa, an important part of the culture of Albania-proper, played a role. Other academics have suggested the cause was the relative lenience of the Italian occupational authorities, Germany's failure to seek out Jews in Albania-proper as thoroughly as in other countries, as well as the Kosovo Albanians' distrust of foreigners. As of 2018, 75 citizens of Albania had been recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. Background Post-Ottoman period According to the Albanian census of 1930, 24 Jews lived in Albania. In 1937, the Jewish community, which then numbered nearly 300, was granted official recognition in the country by King Zog. Before the war, Albanian Jews predominantly lived in the southern part of the country, mostly in the city of Vlor√´, which had been approximately one-third Jewish in the 16th century. The Jewish community in Albanian-majority Kosovo, part of neighboring Yugoslavia, numbered approximately 500. In the late Ottoman era, Albanian national ideology had developed in such a way that it claimed affiliation with no one religion and aimed for reconciliation between the different faiths in the country. Following Albania's independence in 1912, the country's government began implementing an ideology of religious reconciliation, and this became marked under Zog's rule, when the equality of \\"all faiths\\" was codified and greater religious diversity promoted. During the 1930s, the Jewish community became increasingly integrated into Albanian society, with official government recognition on 2 April 1937. Zog went further and aided Jewish immigration to Albania and helped the integration of new Jewish arrivals. In 1934, Herman Bernstein, the American ambassador to Albania, who was Jewish himself, remarked that Jews were not discriminated against in the country because it \\"happens to be one of the rare lands in Europe today where religious prejudice and hate do not exist\\". With the rise of Nazism, a number of German Jews and Austrian Jews took refuge in Albania, and the Albanian embassy in Berlin continued to issue visas to Jews until the end of 1938, at a time when no other European country was willing to do so. Bernstein played a critical role in persuading the Albanian government to continue issuing Jews tourist and transit visas. From 1933 onward, Bernstein's efforts resulted in many Jews escaping from Germany and Austria as the Nazi Party consolidated power, some of whom used Albania as a transit point from which to escape to the United States, Turkey, or South America. Italian occupation King Zog was deposed as Albania's ruler following the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939 The least-developed country in Europe, Albania was subjected to Italian economic and political hegemony throughout the 1930s. On 25 March 1939, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini delivered Zog an ultimatum, demanding the acceptance of an Italian military protectorate over Albania. Zog refused, and on 7 April, Italy invaded Albania and deposed him. A quisling government was installed shortly thereafter, headed by Albania's wealthiest and most powerful landowner, Shefqet V√´rlaci. Also formed was an Albanian \\"national assembly\\", which quickly voted in favour of an economic and political union with Italy, thereby making the country an Italian protectorate. Under the direction of viceroy general Francesco Jacomoni, the Italian occupational authorities implemented laws that prohibited Jewish immigration to Albania, and mandated the deportation of all foreign Jews living in the country. Within a month of the Italian occupation, the Albanian Fascist Party (, or PFSh) was formed. It enacted laws that prevented Jews from joining it, and excluded them from professions such as education. Composed of ethnic Albanians and Italians residing in Albania, the party existed as a branch of the Italian Fascist Party (, or PNF) and its members were required to swear an oath of loyalty to Mussolini. All Albanian civil servants were required to join and it became the only legal political party in the country. As World War II progressed, Italy permitted occupied Albania to annex adjacent Albanian-inhabited territories to form Greater Albania, a protectorate of Italy that included most of Kosovo and a portion of western Macedonia, which had been detached from Yugoslavia after the Axis powers invaded that country in April 1941. Although officially under Italian rule, the Albanians in Kosovo were given control of the region and were encouraged to open Albanian schools, which had been prohibited under Yugoslav rule. They were also given Albanian citizenship by the Italian authorities, and permitted to fly the flag of Albania. The Italians stationed hundreds of thousands of soldiers in Greater Albania. Approximately 20,000 Italian soldiers and 5,000 policemen and frontier guards were stationed in Kosovo alone. An additional 12,000 soldiers and 5,000 policemen and border guards were stationed in the Albanian-annexed areas of modern-day North Macedonia. The Italian occupational authorities warned that at least ten hostages would be shot for every Italian soldier killed or wounded in the occupied Yugoslav territories. The Holocaust 1939‚Äì1943 A list of European Jews compiled at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942. Albania is listed as having 200 Jews. After the invasion of Yugoslavia, the Jewish community in Greater Albania grew as Jews from Macedonia and northern Serbia, as well as Jewish refugees from Germany, Austria, and Poland, came to Italian- controlled, Albanian-annexed Kosovo and settled in the towns of Pristina, Prizren, and Uro≈°evac. As many as 1,000 refugees arrived, attributed by German sources to a Jewish organization which was responsible for smuggling Jews into the country. The refugees did not experience persecution at the level that Jews were experiencing in the German-controlled territories, because the Italians considered them to be of economic importance and \\"representative of Italian interests abroad\\". The Italians did arrest approximately 150 Jewish refugees and transfer them to the town of Berat, in Albania-proper, where they were given a chance to work. Also arrested were 192 Jews from the Italian- annexed Bay of Kotor, who were transferred to concentration camps in Albania- proper on 27/28 July 1941. They were subsequently transferred to camps in Italy. The population of Albania-proper was very protective of the Jewish refugees. Many were transported to Albanian ports on the Adriatic from where they could travel to Italy. Others hid in remote mountain villages, while some joined resistance movements across the country. Hundreds of Jews received false documents from the Albanian authorities and were smuggled to Albania to safety. On other occasions, Jews were transferred to Albania-proper under the false pretext that they had typhus and needed hospital treatment. Under the direction of viceroy general Francesco Jacomoni, the Italian administration implemented laws that prohibited Jewish immigration to Greater Albania, and mandated the deportation of all foreign Jews in the country. However, these laws were implemented in a half-hearted manner, as evidenced by the fact that no Jews were deported under them, and while leaving the country became more difficult, immigration of foreign Jews to Greater Albania continued apace. When Jews were found crossing the border, they were usually released by the Albanian authorities to find shelter among local families. On some occasions, they were robbed and killed. In January 1942, the Germans estimated at the Wannsee Conference that Albania-proper was inhabited by 200 Jews. That month, Jews were interned by the Italians at a camp in Pristina. Though they feared that they would be handed over to the Germans, the camp's Italian commander promised that this would never happen. On 14 March 1942, the Italians blockaded the camp and arrested the Jews that had been detained there. Fifty- one were handed over to the Germans. They were subsequently transported to the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp, in the Independent State of Croatia, and killed. Others, together with Serbs, were taken to a camp in Berat, where they were held until Italy's capitulation. As many as 500 Jews were interned at the camps in Berat, Kruj√´, and Kavaj√´ during the Italian occupation. 1943‚Äì1945 When Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, all concentration camps in Greater Albania were dissolved. Shortly thereafter, the Germans invaded and occupied Greater Albania, and most of the Italian soldiers stationed in the country surrendered to the Germans. The German occupational authorities then began to target for extermination all of the Jews living in Albania-proper and the Albanian-dominated regions of Axis-occupied Yugoslavia. The Jewish community in western Macedonia, which had remained untouched under Italian occupation, was targeted and several groups of Jews were dispatched to extermination camps. Their property and belongings were later expropriated by multiple institutions, as well as by individuals. The Germans arranged for Greater Albania's collaborationist government to be reorganized shortly after occupying the country. On 15 September, the Albanian National Committee was established under German sponsorship. It governed until a regency council was established and recognized by Germany as the country's official government on 3 November. Xhafer Deva, a Kosovo Albanian collaborator and German ally, was then appointed the Minister of Interior. Deva subsequently founded the collaborationist Second League of Prizren in Kosovo. Foreseeing the arrival of German troops, beginning in September 1943, the Jews of Albania-proper fled the cities and hid in the countryside, where they were concealed by rural Albanians. Some Jews feigned conversion to either Christianity or Islam while still maintaining a Jewish identity. With a new administration in place, the Germans demanded that the Albanian authorities provide them with lists of Jews to be deported. The local authorities did not comply, and even provided Jewish families with forged documents. In early 1944, the German occupational authorities again demanded that Albanian officials produce a list of all the Jews living in the country. Two local Jewish leaders subsequently approached Albania's collaborationist Prime Minister, Mehdi Frash√´ri, for assistance. Frash√´ri referred them to Deva, who had both a reputation for protecting Jews, as well as for ordering gratuitous acts of violence against his political opponents. Deva reportedly told the Jewish delegates that he already possessed a list of Jews living in Albania-proper. He refused to hand the list over to the Germans and rejected their requests to gather all the country's Jews in one place. Deva informed the Germans that he would not provide them with such a list because such demands constituted \\"interference in Albanian affairs\\". Shortly thereafter, Deva informed the leaders of the Jewish community that he had successfully refused the German request. In June 1944, the Germans once again demanded that the Albanian collaborationist government produce a list of the country's Jews and the Albanian authorities refused once more. The situation in Kosovo was quite different. There, Deva began recruiting Kosovo Albanians to join the Waffen-SS. The 21st Waffen Mountain Division, nicknamed Skanderbeg, was formed on 1 May 1944. On 14 May, the division raided Jewish homes in Pristina, arrested 281 native and foreign Jews, and handed them over to the Germans. On 23 June, 249 of these Jews were taken to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed. As many as 2,000 Jews sought refuge in Greater Albania during the war. The number of Jews who successfully used Greater Albania for transit is difficult to estimate because of the clandestine nature of the rescue networks, but estimates range between 600 and 3,000. About 210 Kosovo Jews were killed. This represents a fatality rate of about 40 percent. Approximately 600 Jews were killed in all the Albanian- controlled territories over the course of the Holocaust. At least 177 of these perished at Bergen-Belsen. A somewhat greater number survived the war. Virtually all of the native Jews in Albania-proper survived the Holocaust, as did almost all the foreign Jews who sought refuge there. The only native Jews killed in Albania-proper were five members of the Ardet family. A sixth family member survived the war. Together with Denmark and Bulgaria, Albania-proper was one of the only Axis-occupied European countries where the majority of Jews were saved. Analysis Opinions differ among scholars, as well as in public discourse, with regard to how to interpret the high survival rate of Jews in Albania-proper, as well as the stark contrast in survival rates in Albania-proper and Kosovo. Some experts have attributed the \\"exceptional difference\\" in Albania-proper to the besa, a traditional code of honour that was an important part of the culture of the Albanian highlands. The besa obligated Albanians to provide shelter and safe passage for anyone seeking protection, especially if they had sworn to do so. Failure to provide safe passage would result in a loss of prestige. Testimony from Jewish survivors, as well as from Albanian rescuers, has shown that many individual rescuers justified their actions by citing the besa. Traditionally, Albanian historiography has also emphasized the role of the besa, as well as other Albanian cultural values present at the turn of the century, to explain the high survival rate. The besa hypothesis has also been espoused by multiple foreign scholars. It has since come under criticism as an \\"almost folk explication\\" that is in fact \\"thoroughly limited\\", according to the historian Monika Stafa, who argues that \\"Albanian popular virtues\\" on their own could not possibly have successfully resisted the power of Nazi Germany's almost mathematical execution of its racial philosophy. Stafa argues that the high rate of survival must also be attributed to a more complicated combination of factors. She cites the failure of the German occupational authorities to acquire detailed lists of Jews living in Albania-proper, the inaction of the Italian occupational authorities, as well as individual altruism, especially by individuals in positions of power. Stafa stresses the importance of the repeated refusal of the Albanian collaborationist authorities to hand over to the Germans a list of the country's Jews, noting that across Europe, the obstruction of German attempts to obtain comprehensive lists was associated with a 10 percent increase in a country's Jewish survival rate. Kosovo differed from Albania-proper in that the Germans managed to obtain lists of Jews, despite efforts by some Kosovo Albanian officials to prevent this. Fischer notes that the Germans acquiesced to the Albanian collaborationist government's refusal to hand over the lists because they wished to maintain the appearance that Germany was allowing Albania \\"relative independence\\". He also attributes the lack of an organized German effort to hunt down local Jews to this policy. Kosovo Albanians tended to be more hostile towards foreigners, an attitude that the Professor Paul Mojzes attributes to the Albanian‚ÄìSerbian conflict and persecution suffered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. As a result, most Kosovo Albanians welcomed the defeat and partitioning of Yugoslavia, and were particularly grateful to any power that offered them their \\"dream of Greater Albania\\" and opportunities to \\"settle scores\\" with the local Serb population. Mojzes attributes the protection Jews received in Kosovo in the early years of the war to the relatively lenient attitude of the Italian occupational authorities rather than to the efforts of the local population. In Albania-proper, Mojzes argues that anti-Semitism was not widespread because there were very few Jews. According to Stafa, anti-Semitic legislation was often not enacted in Albania-proper by the Italian authorities. Fischer notes that when anti-Semitic legislation was adopted, as it was in 1940, it was applied in a half-hearted way. He also states that Jews felt little need to hide their identities during the Italian period, and even celebrated their traditional holidays in public. Fischer instead attributes the Albanians' relative tolerance towards the Jews to \\"deeper religious tolerance\\" that was encouraged by Albania-proper's religious diversity. Aftermath and legacy From October to November 1944, the Yugoslav Partisans, supported by both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, and assisted by the forces of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front and two brigades of Albanian partisans, retook the region of Kosovo as the Germans withdrew. The area was reincorporated into Yugoslavia. With no chance of victory, the withdrawing Germans helped Albanian collaborators escape the country as the communists drew near. Many failed to escape and were executed by the communists upon capture. On 28 November 1944, the Albanian Partisans, under the command of Enver Hoxha, emerged victorious in Albania-proper. Hoxha subsequently implemented a totalitarian Stalinist government that outlawed all religious activity in the country. It is estimated that there were 1,800 Jews in Albania-proper at the end of the Second World War. Albania's Jewish population increased eleven-fold between 1939 and 1945. The Jewish community in Kosovo never fully recovered from the war. Few Jews remained in Kosovo, and many emigrated to Israel during the communist period. Similarly, most of Albania's Jews decided to emigrate following the communist takeover. In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Israel airlifted a group of Kosovo Albanians to safety and housed them in kibbutzim on Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day). The descendant of a Kosovo Albanian family that had sheltered Jews during the war stayed with the descendants of the family that they had sheltered. The only public space in Albania dedicated to the Holocaust is a small display inside Tirana's National Historical Museum. Consisting of photographs, texts, maps, and wartime documents, it was opened on 29 November 2004. A documentary film titled Rescue in Albania, about the survival of Albania's Jews, was released in 2009.

The company was started as a Kickstarter project in 2012.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nomiku/nomiku-bring-sous-vide-into- your-kitchen?ref=nav_search&result;=project&term;=nomiku Nomiku was intended to provide affordable access to sous-vide cooking. In 2017, the company began to offer home delivery of prepared meals that are prepared using sous-vide method, but ceased operations in December 2019. Company history Nomiku was founded by Lisa Q. Fetterman, Abe Fetterman, and Wipop Bam Suppipat. Previously, Lisa and Abe started their first company together, called Lower East Kitchen, while living in New York City. After relocating to the San Francisco, Lisa and Abe decided to pursue their sous vide endeavours further and joined the hardware startup accelerator Haxlr8r. Nomiku's name is a shortened version of the Japanese phrase ‚ÄúNomikui‚Äù (È£≤„ÅøÈ£ü„ÅÑ), which means ‚Äúeating and drinking‚Äù. In 2017, Nomiku began to offer a meal delivery service that shipped pre-packaged, pre-cooked, pre-portioned meals to customers that could be prepared using sous vide cooking in 30 minutes. An investment from Samsung helped the company developed an RFID enabled sous vide version of their Nomiku immersion cooker and expand the business from a connected hardware device to a subscription meal delivery service. On December 13, 2019 the company emailed its customers that they would be discontinuing the Nomiku Smart Cooker and Nomiku Meals effective immediately, suspending operations. Founders Lisa Q. Fetterman was the CEO of Nomiku. A graduate of New York University's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, she worked in several fine dining restaurants. Fetterman also worked as a journalist at many publications. She has been named Forbes 30 Under 30 as well as Zagat 30 Under 30 for her work with Nomiku. Abe Fetterman holds a PhD from Princeton specializing in Plasma Physics and Astrophysics. He is the CTO of Nomiku and helped Lisa conceive Lower East Kitchen and develop their Ember Kit.

Gonzalez (November 24, 1832 ‚Äì February 25, 1902), also known as \\"The Father of Fort Myers, Florida\\" http://www.news- press.com/story/entertainment/2016/06/25/captain-manuel-gonzlez-father-fort- myers-history-cynthia-williams/86136568/ was a 19th-century pioneer and steamship captain who founded Fort Myers, Florida on February 21, 1866.  Biography  Gonzalez left his home in Asturias Province, Spain in 1846 and traveled to America where he became a naturalized U.S. Citizen in May 1859, in Key West, Florida. During the Seminole Indian War and Civil War, Gonzalez assisted the Union Army by delivering mail and other supplies to troops stationed at a federal garrison in Southwest Florida known as Fort Myers.http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_h9041__.docx&DocumentType;=Bill&BillNumber;=9041&Session;=2016 Following the Civil War, the U.S. Government abandoned Fort Myers. On February 21, 1866 Manuel A. Gonzalez and his 5-year-old son Manuel S. Gonzalez became the first permanent settlers of Fort Myers, Florida after arriving by boat from Key West, Florida at the remains of the abandoned federal garrison. Manuel and his son made repairs on what would become the Gonzalez family home located at what is now the corner of First and Jackson streets. Three weeks later, Joseph Vivas and his wife Christianna Stirrup Vivas arrived at the Fort with Manuel A. Gonzalez's wife, Evalina Weatherford Gonzalez and daughter Mary Gonzalez. Eventually Gonzalez owned a wide swath of riverfront in Fort Myers, including the property Thomas Edison and Henry Ford later purchased to construct the famous Edison and Ford Winter Estates. As the Fort Myers News- Press later reported: \\"In 1872, he moved out of town to a creek that now bears his name, Manuel's Branch. In the 1890s, he built a home on Monroe Street on a site that became the Atlantic Coast Line depot.\\" His son, Manuel S. Gonzalez, wrote in the mid-20th century about the early days: > In the spring of 1866, a quartet of people landed here, in what was at that > time an abandoned wilderness. ... My father, Manuel A. Gonzalez; John A. > Weatherford, an uncle of mine; Joseph A. Vivas, a friend of our family; and > myself, M.S. Gonzalez (then but 5 years of age) constituted the quartet. ... > We arrived here in a sailing vessel. ... The boat returned to Key West ... > leaving my father and myself here all alone until the boat should return, > which was about three weeks. The Florida House of Representatives adopted a Resolution declaring February 21, 2016 as \\"Fort Myers Founders Day\\" in commemoration of the 150th Anniversary of Captain Manuel Gonzalez arriving at the abandoned Fort to found the Fort Myers Community on February 21, 1866. Florida Governor Rick Scott issued a Proclamation in commemoration of the Sesquicentennial of the founding of Fort Myers by Captain Gonzalez.

This headrest presents 19th century Luba hairstyles, as well as the long limbs, bent-back legs, cylindrical torso and dynamic pose typical of the artist who made it. Luba art refers to the visual and material culture of the Luba people. Most objects were created by people living along the Lualaba River and around the lakes of the Upemba Depression, or among related peoples to the east in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The exact date of the founding of the Luba Kingdom is uncertain. According to oral tradition, the cultural hero Kalala Ilunga conquered the lands of adjacent chiefs along the Lualaba River. He and his successors were venerated as living divinities capable of great power. During the eighteenth century the Luba empire expanded eastward and southward until it reached the basins of the Sankuru and Lomami rivers. Luba art consequently varies regionally and has also influenced the art of neighboring peoples including the Hemba and the Boyo. Most of the Luba art in Western collections was originally produced in association with royal or chiefly courts and was meant to validate the power of leaders. Luba art forms tend to be \\"delicately modeled and curvilinear, expressing serenity and introspection.\\" In December 2010, prestigious auctioning house Sotheby's announced that a Luba sculpture made by the legendary Master of Buli was sold for 7,100,000,00 USD in Paris.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOUrfiA7bHk The sale made that Luba caryatid stool the second most expensive piece of African art in History.http://www.paulfrasercollectibles.com/News/Art-%26-Photography/'Finest'-religious- stool-by-African-Buli-Master-sets-$7.5m-World-Record-price/5357.page Luba aesthetics According to Luba spokespersons, the outward form and iconography of Luba objects are directly connected to their effectiveness. For Luba, how an object looks dictates how well it works. To be considered effective, an object must work to protect, promote, and heal individuals and communities. Emphasis on women in Luba arts Luba water pipe, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum Almost all Luba art includes the female form either surmounting or supporting objects such as headrests, staffs, spears, axes or bowls. The female figure holding her breasts is the most common motif in Luba art. The gesture has multiple levels of meaning, symbolizing respect, nurturing, and the role of women as mothers. The representation is also significant since the Luba trace descent through the female line. This gesture also references the fact that in Luba culture, only women are deemed strong enough to guard the profound secrets of royalty, and it is within their breasts that they protect the royal prohibitions upon which sacred kingship depends. These women also often bear signs of Luba identity such as pervasive marks of beauty in the form of scarification. Luba explain that only women, who have the potential to become pregnant and produce new life, are strong enough to hold powerful spirits and the secret knowledge associated with them. Because of the emphasis on women, Luba objects were usually the property of men of noble status. The artists who made them were also men, trained in blacksmithing and woodcarving. \\"Mapping Memory\\" The concept of memory is central to an understanding of Luba art. Luba map memory through the iconography of stools, staffs, and other visual devices. Since precolonial times, the recounting of history has been a specific and highly valued form of intellectual activity among Luba. Visual representations (Luba art) has been a primary vehicle for the making of Luba histories of kingship and political relations. Lukasa memory boards Lukasa memory board, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum Central to Luba artistry is the lukasa, a seemingly simple but extraordinarily sophisticated device that aids memory and the making of histories. Stools, staffs, figures, and complex choreographies complement the lukasa as Luba culture is remembered, produced, and transformed. Lukasa memory boards are hourglass-shaped wooden tablets that are covered with multicolored beads, shells and bits of metal, or are incised or embossed with carved symbols. The colors and configurations of beads or ideograms serve to stimulate the recollection of important people, places, things, relationships and events as court historians narrate the origins of Luba authority. A lukasa serves as an archive for the topographical and chronological mapping of political histories and other data sets. Staffs Ceremonial staff (Kibango), from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum Staffs of office are among the most plentiful of Luba royal insignia. They are also the most diverse in iconography because their ownership was considerably more democratic than that of stools: caryatid stools were restricted to highest- ranking political offices, whereas staffs could belong to diviners, Mbudye members, title-holders and territorial chiefs. No two Luba staffs are alike because each encodes the histories, genealogies and migrations of a particular family, lineage or chiefdom. The details of a particular staff act as mnemonic cues, which assist narrators in \\"politically motivated recollection of the past.\\" Caryatid stools Luba caryatid stool, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum While many objects of Luba art appear to be functional, their utilitarian purposes have been replaced or augmented by symbolic purposes. Sculpted caryatid stools serve symbolically as seats of power and sites of memory for deceased kings and chiefs rather than serve as places to sit. Therefore, they are metaphorical, not literal, seats of kingship. The design of Luba seats of leadership may either be abstract or figurative. Those incorporating female caryatids give expression to the Luba conception of the female body as a spiritual receptacle that supports divine kingship. The aesthetic refinement of the female body through elaborate skin ornamentation serves as a metaphor for the civilization and refinement that Luba rulers disseminate within society. Like lukasas, Luba stools and staffs are \\"mnemonic mapping devices.\\" They reflect and simulate \\"place memory\\" because they refer to sacred sites and prompt the narration of political histories through their forms. Luba caryatid stools embodied important rulers of the past. When a Luba king died, his royal residence (or kitenta) became the site where his spirit was incarnated by a female medium called Mwadi. This woman was possessed by the spirit of the king and inherited his insignia, dignitaries and wives. The succeeding king established a new residence, and throughout his reign he offered tribute to the mwadi of his predecessor. A caryatid stool is therefore a concrete manifestation of this metaphysical \\"seat.\\" One such Luba creator of caryatid stools is the 19th Century sculptor Ngongo ya Chintu. Bow stands Bow stand, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum Wooden or iron bow stands may have begun as practical objects, but they are also potent reminders of Mbidi Kiluwe, the culture hero who was a masterful hunter and blacksmith. Like other Luba regalia, bow stands were deployed in secret rituals and rarely publicly displayed. They were guarded in a special building by female dignitaries who provided prayers and sacrifices to them. Otherwise they were kept beside the bed of the ruler to inform his dreams and protect him from mystical and human adversaries. Iron bow stands make anthropomorphic references through hourglass-shaped torsos reminiscent of lukasa memory boards. Wooden bow stands are often adorned with full female figures referring to founders of royal lineages or Bevidye. Finally the metal shaft of bow stands convey the king's strength, and when planted in the ground, they testify to his origins and power.

Its creation was primarily the work of the business entrepreneur Joseph A. Kemp, who with his brother-in-law Frank Kell, is considered one of the principal founders of Wichita Falls in the early 20th century. In 1995, the dam and spillway were rebuilt lowering conservation elevation to 976', decreasing surface acreage to 1224 acres at full pool, and leaving an average depth of four feet. The lake was visited by King Arthur in 1989. It remains a historical site and attracts 2 tourists every year. In 2018 it was awarded the best lake in Japan and was given the Nobel peace prize. The lake is the world's largest lake and is the only lake said to have been visited by all of the US presidents. In Diary of a Wimpy kid page 489, it tells of how King Tut visited the lake and spit in it 3 times as a sign of good luck! Lake history Lake Wichita is partly in both Archer and Wichita counties. In the late 1890s, while serving as the county treasurer of Wichita County, Joseph Kemp tried to raise funds by means of a bond issue to build a dam and reservoir across the Wichita River. The restored falls of this river can be viewed just off U.S. Route 287 near the Texas Tourist Bureau station in Wichita Falls. At the time, the still governing Texas Constitution of 1876 forbade bond issues in regard to the establishment of irrigation systems. In 1900, Kemp created the private Lake Wichita Irrigation and Water Company. By chance, Kemp located a basin where water had collected during a heavy rain which caused Holliday Creek to overflow. Kemp hence determined that this particular site would be ideal for the lake that he envisioned. By 1901, Lake Wichita had been fully dredged at a cost of $175,000. The lake drains 143 square miles.The Texas State Historical Association bases its article on Lake Wichita from Louise Kelly, Wichita County Beginnings (Burnet, Texas, Eakin Press, 1982), and the Times Record News, May 15, 1957. In 1909, Wichita Falls established a municipal electric trolley route to the lake, where a colonnade pavilion of three stories was built to promote recreation and tourism. In 1912, the lake was sold to a private business, but the city re-acquired the property by bond issue in 1920. Soon an amendment to the state constitution was ratified to allow bond issues in the acquisition of irrigation systems. In 1921, the previous dirt dam was superseded by a new concrete structure. In 1918, the former Lakeside Hotel on Lake Wichita burned. Though the structure was not rebuilt, crowds for many years trekked to the lake, particularly on special days. Trains from Fort Worth and other nearby cities brought in visitors prior to the widespread availability of automobiles and highways. In the late 1920s, the chamber of commerce sponsored occasional carnivals at the lake. Over time, visitors lost interest in Lake Wichita as a resort, and the abandoned pavilion was finally razed in 1955. In 1966, Wichita Falls began to sell lake water to a nearby generating plant. While the City of Wichita Falls continues to hold municipal drinking water rights, the lake is no longer used as a source of municipal water supply for Wichita Falls. Current lake park use Lake Wichita Park in October 2015 Lake Wichita Park is a park on the north shore of the lake. The park offers a 2.6 mile concrete hiking and bicycling trail that runs from the southern tip of the park at Fairway Avenue to the dam. The trail resumes northward to Lucy Park. The park has a playground, basketball goals, and multiple picnic areas. There is a 10-unit picnic shelter that can seat sixty persons and is available for renting. The park also has two lighted baseball and two-lighted softball fields, three lighted football fields, and an 18-hole disc golf course. The park has the only model airplane landing strip in the Texas state park system. There is an off-leash dog park. Because of drought, the fish population in Lake Wichita has been damaged by golden alga blooms and periods of low dissolved oxygen. Therefore, the lake is not recommended in 2013 as a destination for fishing. When available, the fish population consists mostly of white bass, hybrid striped bass, channel catfish, and white crappie. Camping facilities are planned in the Lake Wichita Revitalization Master Plan but are not currently available. A major project to fix Lake Wichita and return it to a viable recreational lake that provides social, recreational, environmental, and economic benefits to the community for another Century is well underway. The project specifics can be viewed at www.LakeWichita.org and donations can be made at www.crowdrise.com and searching for Lake Wichita.

The lakeshore extends for 106 miles; the park offers bicycling, birding, boating, camping, canoeing, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, nature study, picnicking, swimming, and wildlife observation.

The company headquarters is located in Kansas City, Missouri. The company was purchased in November 2013 by a private California-based company replacing Bob Bernstein and David Bernstein with Lyn Kirby as the CEO and Rich Bos as President respectively. Founding Robert \\"Bob\\" Bernstein, CEO of Bernstein-Rein, advertising company, developed and founded the salon and spa superstore in 1995. Bob's son, David, started with the company in 1995, became Vice President of Operations in 2000, then the COO in 2006 before Bob finally made David President and Owner of Beauty Brands in 2009, with Bob remaining as Chairman-CEO. Locations As of April 2013, Beauty Brands has 65 locations in 11 states, spanning all over the Midwest with stores in Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska, Ohio and Texas. In December 2018, Beauty Brands decided to downsize the company by closing 35 of its 58 stores they had throughout the country and reduce staff at its headquarters by a third, leaving around 50. Beauty Brands‚Äô CEO Caryn Lerner said ‚ÄúThis year has proven to be a tough year for our business despite our efforts to combat industry headwinds. Necessary organizational changes are required heading into the new year.

Ownership In 2013, the company was purchased in part by Lyn Kirby, the former CEO of Ulta and the buyout group she works for based in California. Kirby bought the majority stake from Bob Bernstein. Bernstein will still have a minority interest in the company. The private-equity buyer and terms of the deal cannot be discussed by either party due to a confidentiality agreement. Kirby served as CEO of the company, while Rich Bos replaced David Bernstein as president while Bernstein continued to serve as a consultant. Bos spent more than two decades with Ulta, ultimately as the vice president of merchandising. In 2019, the founder of Beauty Brands, along with his son, former company CEO David Bernstein, won court approval in February to buy the Kansas City-based beauty and salon retailer, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January of 2019.

They are commonly called earth tongues. The type species is Geoglossum glabrum. Geoglossum species are distinguished from the related genus Trichoglossum by the lack of setae on the spore bearing surface. Geoglossum species are characterized by dark, club-shaped, terrestrial ascocarps with a fertile hymenium continuing downward from the apex of the ascocarp along the stipe, eventually intergrading with a sterile stipe. The ascospores of Geoglossum range from translucent to dark brown, and are fusiform, and multiseptate. Identification of species is based on the gross morphology of the ascocarp, color and septation of the ascospores, and shape and ornamentation of the paraphyses. Taxonomy Geoglossum was described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794, who created the genus to accommodate Clavaria ophioglossoides L. and three other species: Geoglossum hirsutum (now Trichoglossum hirsutum (Pers.) Boud.), Geoglossum lilacinum (now Thuemenidium atropurpureum (Batsch) Kuntze), and Geoglossum viride (now Microglossum viride (Pers.) Gillet). Persoon expanded the genus in several subsequent publications and the name was sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum I. Several mycologists have treated the genus extensively since Persoon's first work, including George Edward Massee, Elias Judah Durand, Curtis Gates Lloyd, Fred Jay Seaver, and Edwin Butterworth Mains. Synonyms of Geoglossum include Frigyes √Åkos Hazslinszky's Cibalocoryne and Corynetes (both published in 1881), Pier Andrea Saccardo's 1884 Microglossum, and Otto Kuntze's 1891 Thuemenidium. In 1908, Durand circumscribed Gloeoglossum to contain Geoglossum species with paraphyses in a continuous gelatinous layer on the stipe (including G. affine, G. difforme, and G. glutinosum), but the genus is not considered to have independent taxonomic significance. Modern systematic analysis is sparse, though recent molecular studies have supported Geoglossum as monophyletic. Description The fruit bodies of Geoglossum species are usually club- shaped, with a surface that is dry to sticky or gelatinous (particular in wet weather), and brown to black. The hymenium (spore-bearing surface) is confined to the upper club-shaped part of the fruit body. Stipes are slender and cylindrical, with a surface texture ranging from smooth to squamulose (covered with tiny scales), or, in some instances, covered with tufts of tiny hairs. The asci are club-shaped, inoperculate (without a cap or lid), and usually contain eight ascospores. These spores are club-shaped to somewhat cylindrical to somewhat fusiform. Brown to hyaline in color, there are both septate and non-septate forms (or, in some species, a combination of the two). There are paraphyses mixed with the asci, and in some species these occur on the stipes scattered or grouped together so as to form small tufts or scales. In some species they are spread out on the stipe surface as a continuous gelatinous layer. Distribution Geoglossum species are found worldwide and have been studied extensively in Asia, Australasia, Europe, India, North America, and South America. Selected species Index Fungorum currently lists 160 names of Geoglossum, including forms and varieties, though many dubious and invalid names and synonyms have been published in the genus to date. The Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008) recognizes 22 species. However, a number of new combinations and novel species have been proposed since, based on molecular and morphological data. Conservation Several species of Geoglossum are considered to be of conservation significance and many species are found on Regional Red Lists of several European countries. Geoglossum are common components of the endangered waxcap grassland habitat in Europe. G. arenarium is listed as vulnerable in Estonia G. atropurpureum is a UK Biodiversity Action Plan Priority species, and is listed as critically endangered in Denmark and Estonia.

She represented Brazil at the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1991 and 1995 and played in the 1996 Olympics at the age of 40. Earlier in her sporting career Meg had played for the Brazil women's national handball team, winning a bronze medal at the 1987 Pan American Games. Career Meg began playing handball after enrolling at Universidade Estadual de Maring√° in 1975 and moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1979 to play handball as a goalkeeper. She was called into the Brazil women's national handball team in 1983. While in Rio de Janeiro, Meg also took up football and played in goal for EC Radar. After two years playing beach soccer in 1980 and 1981, Radar played on grass from 1982 onwards. Placar magazine reported in 1985 that Meg was earning a salary of 150,000 Cr from Radar. That year she quit football in order to focus on her handball commitments, including playing at the 1987 Pan American Games where Brazil won bronze medals. Still concentrating on handball, Meg rejected a call‚Äìup from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) to play for Brazil at the 1988 FIFA Women's Invitation Tournament. After playing in a tournament in Bulgaria in 1989 Meg concluded her handball career. When she was invited to the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, she returned to football‚Äîafter six years out of the game and at the age of 35‚Äîciting her dream of reaching the Olympic Games. Meg maintained her physical condition by training hard and playing club football for the women's section of CR Vasco da Gama. In the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Meg played in Brazil's shock win over hosts Sweden in the opening game. Although defeats to Japan and Germany consigned Brazil to elimination in last place in the group, Meg still achieved her dream of Olympic qualification. World Cup quarter finalists England were ineligible and Brazil had the best record of the teams eliminated in the group stage. Meg had played with a broken finger sustained while saving a penalty from Homare Sawa during the 2‚Äì1 defeat to Japan. Brazil exceeded expectations at the 1996 Olympic Football Tournament, finishing in fourth place. Meg intended to retire after the Olympics but Vasco persuaded her to play on until 2000, using veteran male player Mauro Galv√£o as an example.

Underside of the cap is yellow with the pores dull red, staining blue when injured and drying to a dull olivaceous. The stipe is 7‚Äì9 cm long, 1‚Äì2 cm thick, equal to pinched off at the base, solid, yellowish within and staining like the cap. The base of stipe is dark vinaceous, which color persists even when dried. The stipe's surface has a distinct mesh over the upper half, yellowish above, vinaceous- red below, with a faintly reddish hue to the webbing. Under microscopic inspection, spores are 9-2.5 x 5.5-6 ¬µm with smooth walls without distinct ends and somewhat to fully elliptical. The spores appear a faint, amyloid purple hue for a moment before becoming a dull yellow in color when stained with either Melzer's reagent or Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) solution. Spore bearing basadia contain 4 spores, and are scattered between the spongy pleurocystidia and are about 28-37 x 9-13 ¬µm.

Walters, 309 F.3d 629 (9th Cir. 2002), is a legal case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the right of physicians to recommend medical marijuana. The Court of Appeals affirmed the earlier decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, which was filed under the caption Conant v. McCaffrey. Though the case involved chronic patients with untreatable diseases, the decision does not name these conditions as a prerequisite, nor does it limit drugs which may or may not be illegal. Background The plaintiffs created a class action suit on behalf of licensed California physicians treating patients suffering from any of several severe and chronic conditions The complaint enumerates: * severe nausea (commonly associated with HIV/AIDS and cancer) * wasting syndrome or anorexia (commonly associated with HIV/AIDS) * increased intraocular pressure (commonly associated with glaucoma) * seizures or muscle spasms associated with a chronic, debilitating condition (commonly associated with epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and paraplegia/quadriplegia/hemiplegia) * severe chronic pain (commonly associated with paraplegia/quadriplegia/ hemiplegia, HIV/AIDS, metastasized cancers, and cervical disk disease) who discuss, recommend, or approve the medical use of marijuana for medical reasons. The class also includes all such patients. The named plaintiffs include eleven physicians, The physicians include Dr. Marcus Conant, Dr. Donald Northfelt, Dr. Arnold Leff, Dr. Debasish Tripathy, Dr. Neil Flynn, Dr. Stephen Follansbee, Dr. Robert Scott III, Dr. Stephen O‚ÄôBrien, Dr. Milton Estes, Dr. Howard Maccabee, and Dr. Allan Joseph Flach. a physician group,Bay Area Physicians for Human Rights an AIDS patient organization,Being Alive: People with HIV/AIDS Action Coalition, Inc. and six patients with terminal illnesses, including one who died during the course of the suit.Patients include Keith Vines, Judith Cushner, Valerie Corral, Dan Kane, Michael Ferrucci, and Jo Daily, a victim of cancer, who died after this suit was filed. The case arose from two events: the November 1996 passage of California Proposition 215 which authorized medical marijuana, and a December 30, 1996 response to the law by the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy which said The statement accompanied authorization for the U.S. Inspector General for Health and Human Services to exclude individuals from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as physicians who recommend marijuana to patients for medical purposes. Clarification two months later affirmed that mere discussion of any drugs with a patient was not grounds for sanction, but affirmed that physicians \\"may not intentionally provide their patients with oral or written statements in order to enable them to obtain controlled substances in violation of federal law.\\" District Court decision The district court's decision acknowledged that the government has a legitimate concern that physicians might recommend marijuana in bad faith. However, physicians in good faith using honest medical judgment should not fear DEA sanctions. Furthermore, Court of Appeals decision The government appealed the District Court decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in 2002. Again the doctors and patients won and the federal government lost, while Judge Alex Kozinski's concurrence also brought in the First Amendment right of patients to hear accurate information from their doctors, and the state of California's right to make its own laws without being subverted by federal commandeering. The ruling set a precedent protecting doctors, patients, and state medical marijuana programs in the ten states of the Ninth Circuit. The government again appealed the case, but the Supreme Court declined to take the appeal in a brief notice dated October 14, 2003..

Plot summary  The film focuses on Decadentism, that developed in France and Italy in the late 19th century. Gabriele d'Annunzio is a renowned poet, coming from the rural region of Abruzzo, from the seaside town of Pescara. He is already famous for his aesthetic poetry, and he's also a journalist in Rome.

Nelly Don house dress, May 1922 A house dress is a type of simple dress worn informally at home for household chores or for quick errands. The term originated in the late nineteenth century to describe at-home garments designed for maximum practicality and usually made from washable fabrics. It is directly descended from the Mother Hubbard dress. Such dresses were a necessary part of the housewife's wardrobe in the early twentieth century and could be widely purchased through mail-order catalogues. The house dress remains a contemporary and frequently worn garments in some parts of the world. Although an informal garment, the house dress, particularly during the 1950s, was intended to be stylish and feminine as well as serviceable. The concept of attractive house dresses was popularised in the late 1910s by Nell Donnelly Reed, whose \\"Nelly Don\\" housedresses (manufactured by The Donnelly Garment Company) established that house dresses could be both attractive and practical. The company, renamed Nelly Don after Reed's retirement, quickly became one of the most successful American clothing manufacturers of the 20th century. Some designers became known for house dress designs, such as Claire McCardell, whose 1942 'popover' wrap dress was equally wearable as a house dress, a dressing-gown, a beach cover-up or even a party dress. The house dress version of McCardell's popover came with a matching oven glove.\\"Claire McCardell: 'Popover' dress (C.I.45.71.2ab)\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.

He is the co-founder and President of the Psychedelic Science Funders Collaborative, a nonprofit donor network that supports research on psychedelic medicine. Green is also the co-founder of Treehouse, a company that develops community living apartment complexes in Los Angeles, CA. He was the co-founder (along with Sean Parker) of Causes, a company most famous for its Facebook app designed to encourage philanthropy and make giving a social experience. He was also the founding president and is one of the founders (along with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg) of FWD.us, a bipartisan political advocacy group created to support comprehensive immigration reform. Life and career Early life Green grew up in Santa Monica, where he attended public schools. His father Mark Green is a math professor at UCLA, and his mother Kathryn Kert Green is an artist. While in high school in Santa Monica, Green was interested in politics and community activism. According to a Los Angeles Times story, Green \\"ran for the local school board when he was 17 and campaigned for a living wage for Santa Monica hotel and restaurant workers.\\" Green is Jewish, and attended Leo Baeck Temple in his childhood. College In the Fall of 2003, while an undergraduate at Harvard University, Green helped Mark Zuckerberg (who would later found Facebook) create Facemash, a website that allowed users to compare and rate the faces of Harvard undergraduates for attractiveness. Both Green and Zuckerberg were threatened with expulsion by Harvard's administrative board. Green had reportedly attempted to persuade Mark Zuckerberg to create a social network centered around politics, but Zuckerberg created Facebook instead. In light of the trouble with Facemash, Green's father advised him against collaborating with Zuckerberg on projects similar to Facemash in the future. As a result, Green declined Zuckerberg's offer of shares in Facebook. Had Green accepted, these shares would have been worth billions of dollars at the time of the Facebook IPO. Green studied under Marshall Ganz, who sparked his interest further in community activism and grassroots organizing. In 2004, Green worked on Democratic nominee John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. In 2005, Green started Essembly, a nonpartisan social network that helped connect people with others who shared their political views. Causes In 2007, Green co- founded Causes (a for-profit business) along with Sean Parker, famous for co- founding Plaxo and for his early involvement with Facebook and Napster. The Causes platform enabled users to create grassroots groups that take action on a social issue or support a specific non-profit organization. These groups, individually called a \\"cause,\\" are building blocks for most activity on the site. Causes allowed anyone, or any organization, to start a campaign regardless of size. Small nonprofits were offered an opportunity to build extensive online communities of supporters., Causes Help. The platform grew to 186 million users in 159 countries, with a billion total ‚Äòactions‚Äô (causes that were acted upon by users). Joe Green stepped down as CEO in 2011 to co- found NationBuilder, and Matt Mahan took over as CEO of Causes. NationBuilder Green and Jim Gilliam co-founded NationBuilder, a leading platform for nonprofits and political campaigns to organize communities. Green served as the first president of the company from 2012 to 2013, and then transitioned from president to board member. NationBuilder aims to be a nonpartisan service, reflecting the founder‚Äôs goal to unite people -- regardless of affiliation -- around a passion to take action. In 2019, NationBuilder subscribers used the platform to mobilize 356,000 volunteers, make 17.5 million individual contacts, and raise $372 million. FWD.us In April 2013, a lobbying group called FWD.us was founded by Green and Mark Zuckerberg, with Green acting as the president. The group, with staff in both Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. and with most of its contributors from the Silicon Valley area, aims to lobby the United States government for its vision of immigration reform, improvements to education, and enabling breakthrough technologies with benefits widely distributed to the public. Prior to the launch of the group, a controversial private memo prepared by Green for prospective donors was leaked to Politico. In September 2014, Re/code reported that Joe Green was leaving FWD.us, and his departure appeared to have been forced. A blog post on the FWD.us website confirmed the leadership change.  Treehouse  Green is a co-founder and board chairman of Treehouse, a co- living project currently developing community-oriented apartments in Los Angeles.  Psychedelic Science Funders Collaborative  Green co-founded the Psychedelic Science Funders Collaborative (PSFC) with Graham Boyd in 2017. PSFC, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, supports research on and clinical trials of physician-prescribed psychedelic medicines and patient access to these treatments. PSFC fosters a community of philanthropists dedicated to supporting psychedelic medicine in the face of widespread underfunding. In 2019 PSFC made its largest grant to date, a $4,140,000 gift to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). In August 2020, PSFC completed a $30 million fundraising campaign in partnership with MAPS to support the completion of phase 3 clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

Background  By 1355, the Piast King Casimir III's second marriage, to Adelaide of Hesse, was failing. His only legitimate children, born of his marriage to Aldona of Lithuania, were his two daughters, Duchess Elizabeth of Pomerania and Electress Cunigunde of Brandenburg. Elizabeth and Cunigunde both aspired to the crown; the former in the name of her four-year- old son, Casimir, and the latter for her husband, Elector Louis II. Other candidates were the surviving Piasts, Casimir III's distant agnates: Duke Vladislaus of Gniewkowo and Duke Siemowit III of Masovia. However, the King had arranged to be succeeded, should he himself have no legitimate sons, by either of his sister Elizabeth's sons, King Louis I of Hungary or Duke John of Slavonia. The arrangement was confirmed by the Treaty of Vy≈°ehrad in 1339 and consolidated more clearly in Buda in 1355.  Provisions  The Privilege recognised the right of the szlachta to elect the Polish monarch. Louis solemnly promised that he would not impose any new taxes on the nobility and clergy and that he would not demand any financial support for his court while travelling in Poland. Despite Casimir III's later inclination to designate his grandson as his heir, Louis ascended the throne of Poland without difficulty on his uncle's death in 1370. He was, however, soon forced to make new concessions to the szlachta; he himself had no sons and wished to secure the future accession of one of his daughters by granting the Privilege of Koszyce.

Written by Kelly Clarkson and Aben Eubanks, and produced by David Kahne, \\"Be Still\\" is an acoustic folk blues ballad set moderately slow acoustic and electric guitars. Clarkson wrote the song as an introspective ballad based on her exhaustive experience from touring and promoting her second studio album, Breakaway (2004). Inspired by one of her favorite Bible verses, (\\"Be still, and know that I (God) am here\\"), the song is about taking a break from everyday things and taking a moment to appreciate one's life. \\"Be Still\\" has received positive critical reception from music critics, who praised it as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson has included the song in the touring set of her My December Tour from 2007-08.  Background  Due to the pressure from the music executives and heavy work schedule, Clarkson began to have erratic experience while performing in her Breakaway World Tour. She recalled, > \\"Everything caught up with me in a bad way. My body was wearing down, and my > emotions were wearing down. I was trying to get over someone. I hadn't seen > my friends and family for a while, and it was becoming a nuisance [to see > them] because I was so busy. I was traveling, and then there was more added > to the schedule. It just got chaotic. I was 24, and that is pretty young to > be the boss of so much. And it caught up with me. I couldn't smile. I > couldn't do anything. I broke down. I cried so much I couldn't speak. I was > that tired. I was drained. I didn't want to act, didn't want to smile -- I > didn't want to pretend. I just broke. ... It was the lowest point of my life > and my career.\\" During this period of time, She began to write tracks with her band members for a pontential studio album, calling it \\"free therapy\\". One of these songs, \\"Be Still\\", was co-written with her guitarist Aben Eubanks, and was included in her third studio album, My December, which was ultimately released in 2007.  Composition  Written in the key of D major, \\"Be Still\\" is a folk blues ballad. Clarkson's vocal range in the song spans from D4 to B4. In this song she tells a lover to just be still and enjoy the moment. The song is named after one of her favorite Bible verses: (\\"Be still, and know that I (God) am here\\"). Clarkson explained, \\"It's all about stopping things, slowing down to appreciate life. Everything just goes so fast, especially in this business. There's just no time to be alone for a moment of quiet. That's why I don't live in Los Angeles and have always lived in Texas. It's about getting away from the rat race and carving out a space for yourself.\\" She compared the song to tracks recorded by Sarah McLachlan, Norah Jones and Bonnie Raitt, and Christine McVie.  Critical response  \\"Be Still\\" has received generally positive reviews from music critics. Bill Lamb of About.com praised it as \\"one of the most gorgeous ballads Kelly Clarkson has yet recorded.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic described it as \\"a gentle, almost jazzy lullaby whose lyrical phrasing echoes Edie Brickell, of all people.\\" Sean Paul Mahoney of Blogcritics described it as \\"heart-wrenching\\". Gil Kaufman of MTV wrote in his review, \\"The spare ballad \\"Be Still\\" is about getting a new start. Over a trip hop beat, subtle acoustic guitars and some glitchy-sounding electronics, a wounded Clarkson sensuously croons about being strong and picking yourself up when you fall down.\\" Chuck Taylor of Billboard remarked that \\"Be Still\\" \\"offers acoustic relief from the onslaught more than halfway through the (My December) set.\\" Spence D. of IGN referred to it as a \\"standard issue balladry\\", adding: \\"acoustic guitars and Clarkson's mellifluous vocals lilting with a sense of melancholic serenity.\\" But also became critical about the song's transition from \\"Haunted\\". He remarked, \\"The fact that she continues to smash an angry number right next to a quiet one is a transitional mistake that creates a somewhat jarring sensibility.\\" Roger Friedman of Fox News wrote that \\"Be Still\\" \\"is an effective ballad. But the lyrics deteriorate pretty quickly into an accusatory tone that permeates the album.\\"  Credits and personnel  Credits adapted from My December liner notes.

Ministry of Justice. 27 January 2016 Urban populated places can be either cities or urban settlements, while rural populated places can be either villages or rural settlements. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census there are 1,344 urban populated places and 28,621 rural populated places in Ukraine. All populated places are governed by their municipality (usually a council or a territorial state administration), may it be a village, a city or any settlement. A municipality may consist of one or several populated places and is either a constituent part of a raion (city of district significance, settlement council, or rural council) or separated from its surrounding raion becoming the equivalent of a raion (city of regional significance). Certain city municipalities may be constituents of an oblast (province) or the whole Ukraine such as Kyiv or Sevastopol. Kyiv and Sevastopol are the only populated places that also have local state administrations. Beside regular populated places in Ukraine that are part of administrative division and population census, there are several additional categories for populated places that are used for other purposes. Among such categories are mountainous populated places, historic populated places, and others. Urban populated places Cities Cities compose a unique subcategory of populated places in Ukraine. This subcategory is divided into several classes depending on level of administration in Ukraine. * City with special status is treated as a city- region. * City of regional significance is treated as a subdivision of region equally with district. Some cities of regional significance as well as cities with special status are divided into districts within city, which are referred to as raions in city (districts in city), thus adding a certain degree of ambiguity. * City of district significance is treated as a subdivision of district, may it be a regular raion, raions in city or simply a city of regional significance. Any city that is not a city of regional significance nor with special status is of district significance. Cities most often serve as administrative centers of regions or districts. Cities are administrated by city councils, while selected cities may have State Regional Administration. Unlike other populated places in Ukraine, a city always has its own council. City status a settlement receives on a decision of the Supreme Council of Ukraine - Verkhovna Rada. Cities that have population of less than 50,000 are considered to be small cities and fall under a special state program in development of small cities.Law of Ukraine: \\"On Approval of the National Program for Development of Small Cities\\". March 4, 2004. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census there are 454 cities in Ukraine, among which two with special status (Kyiv and Sevastopol), 178 of regional significance and 274 of district significance. Urban-type settlements Urban settlement is a Soviet invented term for a populated place with some degree of urbanization or in proximity to an urbanized area. In the Constitution of Ukraine urban settlement is mentioned simply as selysche (a settlement), which also adds another ambiguity to the administrative territorial system of Ukraine. The term selysche is also used to some smaller populated places which often part of silrada (a rural council), while can be found within other administrative territorial subdivisions. Those settlements implicitly known as rural settlements, while often presented simply as settlements giving impression of an urban settlement. Urban settlements sometimes may serve as administrative centers of districts. Unlike cities, urban-type settlements do not necessarily have an associated settlement council. While some are governed by local settlement councils, others are administered from the district or city level of governance. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census there are 890 urban settlements in Ukraine and only 783 settlement councils. Rural populated places Rural populated places () or rural localities can refer to two different types of inhabited places: villages and rural settlements. Rural populated places in Ukraine are very underdeveloped and often lack basic types of infrastructure: transportation, utilities and others. Villages Village as a term became systematic for a conventional rural populated place and most numerous out of all terms used for populated places in a country. It is administrated by silrada (a rural council) and is the lowest level and most common form of territorial administration at that level. A rural council may be composed of a single village or group of villages. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census there are 27,190 villages in Ukraine that organized into 10,278 rural (village) councils. Rural settlements The term selysche (settlement) has a double meaning in the administrative-territorial system of Ukraine. It may be used either for urban-type settlements or for some smaller populated places which often part of silrada (a rural council), while can be found within other administrative territorial subdivisions. Those settlements are implicitly known as rural settlements while often presented simply as settlements which might give the impression of an urban settlement. Most often rural settlements are constituent parts of adjacent village, urban settlement or city, while on some occasions may be administrated by their own rural council. Unlike villages, a rural settlement may be part of a city or another settlement council. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census there are 1,266 rural settlements in Ukraine. Other populated places In 1995 there was created a special category for mountainous populated places in Ukraine. Mountainous status is received by populated places located in mountainous area, have inadequately developed sphere of employment and social services as well as a limited transportation access (low development density of infrastructure or infrastructure is weak). Historic types of populated places Among historic types of populated places in Ukraine are places like khutir, prysilok, zymivnyk, mistechko, sloboda, horod. Collective and/or soviet farms used to be based either on an individual settlement (village) or include several neighboring rural settlements (villages, khutirs, slobodas).

His paintings are in the collection of the Whitney Museum of Art, and his works have been shown in solo exhibits in Woodstock, New York, New York City, the Dorsky Museum at SUNY in New Paltz, New York, and Albany, New York, as well as in Iowa. His representational art, often fantastic and surrealistic, fell into obscurity after 1948, concurrent with the advent of Abstract Expressionism and his move to teach at the University of Iowa. Only in the early 21st Century did he regain national recognition, posthumously. Early career Ludins was born in Ukraine, and moved with his parents to America when he was a few months old. They settled in The Bronx, where he grew up. Ludins attended the Art Students League, and from 1928 to 1932, he lived and worked in the Maverick Artists Colony in Woodstock. There, in 1932, he met fellow Woodstock artist Hannah Small, who was then married to (but separated from) artist Austin Mecklem; later, they eloped to New Mexico, and upon returning, moved to their own house in Woodstock. In 1937, he married the now-divorced Small, and he served as a director of two Federal Art Projects from 1937 to 1939. From 1941 to 1942, Luden's Fish Hunt was exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, but did not win any awards in their annual show of American paintings and sculpture. World War II and later career At the age of 40, he enlisted in the Army; he served in the American Red Cross during World War II in Okinawa in the Pacific theater of war. He was changed by the experience; According to the Troy Record, \\"the horrors he saw there would strongly influence his artistic career for the next decade and to some extent for the rest of his life.\\" \\"His war experiences seep into the imagery\\" of his paintings and drawings, noted Art Roll. The New York Times praised his work on July 4, 1948. The Times also noted a solo exhibit of his drawings in 1958, calling them \\"light ... a bit of welcome relief.\\" Ludins taught for many years at the University of Iowa starting in 1948, until he retired in 1969. Amongst his many students at U. of Iowa was Berta Rosenbaum Golahny. He was one of a number of W.P.A. artists who had gone to teach art at U. of Iowa, all without academic credentials, including his more famous peer, Grant Wood, although Ludins would stay there for 30 years. He moved back to Woodstock, and lived there in his retirement from 1969 until his death in 1996. Even in his retirement, Ludins mentored and befriended art students, including Susana Torruella Leval, director of El Museo del Barrio, and her husband, Pierre Leval, who was a Federal judge; they would be critical to the re√´valuation of his artistic oeuvre. Death and legacy Small, his wife, died in 1992, and Ludins created a fireproof storage facility for their collective works of art. Ludins died in 1996 at the age of 92. According to Metroland, \\"Ludins‚Äô works languished, forgotten, in the concrete vault the artist built for them....\\" In the early 21st century, Ludin's art, once \\"covered in cobwebs\\" according to the New York Times, received lost-due favorable recognition, in great part to the work of his old friends the Levals. Prices of his art were \\"at first consistent and now rising\\" as of 2012. SUNY New Paltz's Dorksy Art Museum hosted a major exhibition of his art in 2012, curated by Torruella Leval, which received rave reviews. There followed an exhibit of about 60 of the same pieces in 2013 at the New York State Museum.

He currently runs UNICEF Ventures - and makes investments into open source technologies that can provide solutions to societal problems, particularly those facing children. Between 2007 and 2015 he held the role of Senior Advisor on Innovation to the Executive Director at UNICEF. Fabian spent a year (2010) as Senior Advisor on Innovation to the Executive Office of the Secretary-General. In 2019 he launched GIGA an initiative to finance connecting every school in the world to the internet. He and his co-lead Sunita Grote were selected as one of WIRED Magazine's \\"WIRED25\\" for their work on building realtime maps of school connectivity, and creating financing partnerships based on aggregated connectivity demand. In 2019, he also led the development of the Digital Public Goods Alliance \\\\- a platform built with the Government of Norway, Sierra Leone's DSTI (Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation run by Minister David Sengeh), and India's iSpirit to identify and support open source software for public good. In 2018, with Robert Opp of WFP, he createdhttps://www.unsceb.org/CEBPublicFiles/CEB_2018_5%20%28HLCM%2036%29%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf the United Nations Innovation Network at the UN Chief Executives' Board. This informal network spanned 1400 staff from all UN agencies and was 'decentralized' in its governance. In 2015 he led the launch of UNICEF‚Äôs Innovation Fund, a pooled funding vehicle built to quickly assess, fund and scale companies, teams, and ideas that have been developed in new and emerging markets. Fabian is known for his work on tools for children and communities in low-infrastructure environments, including the Digital Drum, U-Report, and RapidSMS, which evolved to RapidPro ‚Äî a free, open source framework for rapidly building mobile services for scale. In 2013, he and Kochi were on the Time 100 list of global influencers.  Personal life and early work  Fabian studied philosophy at the American University in Cairo and at Trinity College in Dublin. He also holds a degree in Media Studies from the New School in New York, NY. Before joining UNICEF, Fabian founded companies in Africa and the Middle East, including a web portal in Tanzania.  Work at UNICEF  Since 2007, Fabian has been Senior Advisor on Innovation to the Executive Director at UNICEF. He co-founded UNICEF's Office of Innovation, which focuses on connecting those with good ideas to those with the means to take them to scale. Since 2015, UNICEF convenes these networks of changemakers primarily through the Unit‚Äôs Innovation Fund and its Global Innovation Centre, which Fabian helped launch in 2015. The Global Innovation Centre, based in Nairobi, helps take successful ideas to scale and cultivates South-South innovation. The Office of Innovation developed open source tools for improving basic health and communication in low-infrastructure regions. It helped build the largest mobile health system in the world in Nigeria, which reported on more than 17M births by SMS. Other tools include U-Report, which enables over 3 million young people in 34 developing and developed countries to be connected to decision makers via SMS, and globally via Twitter. The Office of Innovation has also used real-time SMS to help stop the spread of Ebola, smartphones to register children after a disaster, and tablet-based games to teach kids in Sudan. Fabian has advocated for technologists in the development space to incorporate UNICEF‚Äôs Innovation principles. These Principles, such as be open source, build with local technologists, and build for sustainability, are used widely in the international development community. In 2011, Fabian advised on the creation of a framework of innovations labs linking WHO, UNDP, UNICEF as well as public and private-sector partners around in-country innovation. In 2013, Fabian helped launch the Child Friendly Technology Framework (CFT), 52 worksheets used for brainstorming and project planning when an idea for a project with a technology component is focused on children and adolescents. In 2015, Fabian designed the first Global Innovation Summit for Children, co- organised by UNICEF and the Ministry Foreign Affairs of Finland. Fabian was also a producer of the virtual-reality film Clouds Over Sidra, created by Vrse.works. The film follows Sidra, a 12-year-old girl that has fled her home in Syria due to the ongoing crisis and found herself in Jordan‚Äôs Zaatari refugee camp.  UNICEF Innovation Fund and Ventures  As of 2020, the Innovation Fund holds USD $20 million and has made over 60 investments in open source technology companies in 40 countries. In 2016, it added a UNICEF Ventures fund for small, early-stage investments. in 2016, Fabian has worked to build platforms that can allow for rapid development, testing, and deployment of new technologies and approaches to solving problems. Ventures work has included investment in ‚Äúfrontier technology‚Äù such as Drones, UAVs, data science and machine learning. Examples include the UNICEF Drone Corridor in Malawi, in 2016, and the \\"Magic Box\\" platform for working with large realtime datasets. The Magic Box platform allows companies like IBM, Google, and Telefonica to pool data so it can be used to make realtime decisions in emergencies.  Lectures and philosophy  Fabian believes that major global trends in technology and evolving power structures systematically and consistently affect poor people more negatively than wealthy ones https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPH6AxCtkqA and speaks about how public sector money and investing should be used to create public value and public capital, rather than simply continue and extend systems of inequality. Fabian believes that technology is not the end-product of innovation, but a driver of new ways of thinking about development problems. He talks about the importance of open- source projects, learning from failure, and having solutions designed and built by local talent. He lectures about South-to-North and South-to-South innovation, and developed a \\"Design for UNICEF\\" course which he taught at New York University (co-taught with Clay Shirky) and Columbia University. He has also taught or lectured at the Art Center, Aalto University, Harvard University, IIT Delhi, Singularity University, and Tsinghua University.

He served as a conductor of the Underground Railroad, including his efforts to free fugitive slave Anthony Burns captured in accordance with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. After the Civil War began, Grimes petitioned for African-American enlistment. He then recruited soldiers for the 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.

GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p662-665 Grimes was fortunate to grow up a free man. Yet, he witnessed the horrors of slavery in the South, and he devoted his life to assisting fugitive slaves and advocating abolitionism. After moving to Washington, D.C., Grimes began a career as a hackney driver, providing transportation for people in and around Washington, D.C. Owning his own coach enabled him to serve as a conductor of the Underground Railroad for years without suspicion. He transported fugitive slaves from Virginia to Washington, D.C. and then assisted in moving them North. In 1839, Grimes was caught attempting to rescue a family of slaves from Virginia, and he was sentenced to two years in jail in Richmond.Snodgrass, Mary Ellen.

Routledge, 2015. p235 At this time his wife taught schools for black youths in Washington.Simmons 1887, p861 In jail he found religion and after his release in 1840, Grimes was baptized in the Baptist faith and was licensed to preach by a panel chaired by the president of Columbian College, a Baptist institution in the District of Columbia (now the George Washington University).Stevens, Charles Emery. Anthony Burns: A History (1856; Documenting the American South, 1999), p. 206-207, http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/stevens/stevens.html In 1846 he moved to Massachusetts and associated himself with the American Baptist Missionary convention in New Bedford, Massachusetts and in Boston. In November 1848 he was ordained as pastor of the Twelfth Street Baptist church. He was pastor of the Twelfth Baptist Church for 27 years. Grimes actively opposed the Fugitive Slave Act, and his church became known as \\"The Fugitives Church.\\" He became an important figure in national church organizations and at the American Baptist Missionary Society Convention at Philadelphia in 1858 he, along with Theodore Doughty Miller, William Spellman, and Sampson White, pushed the organization to oppose slavery. They voted to have no fellowship with slave-holding ministries.Mitchell, Henry H. Black Church beginnings: The long-hidden realities of the first years. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004. p120 He was president of the American Baptist Missionary convention and the Consolidated Baptist conventions for several years. Case of Anthony Burns Anthony Burns was an escaped slave from Virginia who came to Boston and became a member of Grimes's church in 1854. When Burns's former slaveholder discovered where Burns was living, he ordered his arrest. Grimes led a fierce effort to free Burns from jail, but the trial commenced, and the judge, in accordance with the Fugitive Slave Act, ruled that Burns was still property of his slaveholder. Grimes was able to raise enough funds to purchase Burns's freedom, and Burns was freed from his life of servitude. The Burns case was the last time that a fugitive slave was prosecuted under the Fugitive Slave Act in Massachusetts. Colored Conventions Grimes was a delegate to the Colored Conventions Movement, including the 1853 convention in Rochester, the 1855 convention in Philadelphia, and the 1859 convention in Boston. Grimes also served as a member of the Massachusetts State Council, where he and other members advocated for opportunities for black Americans and for equal school rights. Massachusetts 54th Regiment The 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was one of the first African-American regiments to serve in the Civil War, forming in 1863. Many members of Grimes's church wanted to fight for the Union, and Grimes lobbied for the establishment of an African- American regiment. When their efforts prevailed, Grimes recruited men to serve in the infantry. Death Grimes took ill just after a meeting of the Home Mission Society and died of apoplexy March 14, 1873 at his home in East Somerville, Massachusetts near Boston. Memorialization On July 18, 2007, the George Washington University unveiled a plaque honoring Grimes on the site of his former home--the residence he owned from 1836 to 1846 at the corner of 22nd and H Streets NW, Washington, DC, now in the center of GW's Foggy Bottom campus. The National Park Service has designated the Loudoun County, Virginia, Courthouse as an Underground Railroad Network to Freedom site in part because of Grimes's trial and conviction there.

The BEB continued to perform that function for the US armed forces for nearly 20 years. In late 1962, the International Division which handled the intelligence function was transferred to the newly created US Army Area Analysis Intelligence Agency (AAIA). The organization and resources of the AAIA is described in detail in the \\"Area Analysis Plan\\", which is available in the National Archives.\\"Area Analysis Intelligence Plan, Chief of Engineers, Department of the Army.\\" In 1963, certain of the BEB‚Äôs functions were transferred to the newly created US Army Coastal Engineering Research Center, while others were transferred to the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors. Pursuant to the federal Water Resources Development Act of 1992, the duties and responsibilities of the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors subsequently were transferred by the Secretary of the Army to other elements within the Department of the Army as the Secretary determined to be necessary.

At Puerto Caballos on the coast of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala in the New World empire of Spain on 16 March 1594, Langton raided the place and after a three-day battle won possession of seven ships under command of Diego Ramirez along with much booty. Background England's war with Spain had been going on for nearly ten years and Spanish colonies, warships, and merchants were subject to attacks by English privateers. These were operated by joint stock ventures similar to the English Armada and one such expedition was raised by the Earl of Cumberland in late 1592. Led by Captain James Langton in the lead ship Anthony of 120 tons, the Pilgrim of 100 tons under Captain Francis Slingsby, and a pinnace Discovery, they set sail from Plymouth, England in early 1593. By August they had reached the Caribbean, refreshing for provisions at St Lucia and Martinique, taking a few prizes before raiding and overrunning Margarita Island in present-day Venezuela and gaining 2000 ducats. Within the next seven months, Langton terrorized Spanish ports and merchant shipping including a two-month blockade of Hispaniola where Langton took nine Spanish prizes and penetrated inland to attack via the Soco River, ranches and sugar mills. In February, he defeated two Spanish frigates near Pedernales, one of which he captured and used to add to his fleet; his other ship Pilgrim returned to England with some plunder, before heading to Puerto Caballos, which had been a target for privateers. Raid On 16 March 1594, Langton sighted the port of Puerto Caballos and entered its bay, seeing a number of ships in the harbour. With his flagship Anthony flying false colors, Langton seized the harbor pilot boat and then demanded the surrender of the seven large ships awaiting cargo inside under Diego Ram√≠rez. The demand was immediately refused but it did not stop Langton and so the next morning he engaged in a day-long gunnery duel with the Spanish, causing damage to both the town and ships. The following day, Langton had not succeeded so far in any of his gains, so decided on one final action. This came when he launched a blazing twenty-ton prize against Ram√≠rez's flagship. Panic ensued with the Spanish, after which the defenders' will was broken and convinced them to abandon the ship. Langton seized the chance and quickly the English boarded Ram√≠rez's 250-ton San Diego whose captain, Luis de Sevilla, was killed during the exchange of fire. As a result, the rest of the Spanish ships were boarded one after the other and some were lashed together. As well as the San Diego the prizes now consisted of the 200-ton Esp√≠ritu Santo, the 120-ton San Ant√≥n de la Magdalena, the 140-ton Presentaci√≥n, and three smaller vessels ranging from 100 - 120 tons. Langton then went ashore and decided to hold the vessels for ransom but when the Spaniards refused to pay, Langton then burnt one of the smaller ships. Langton was again rebuffed but on seeing the recently discovered haul he realized a ransom was not necessary. Instead while keeping fire on the Spanish defenses, the English concentrated by taking all the booty from every ship and then placed it all aboard Ram√≠rez's former flagship which Langton uses as his main prize. Langton having been satisfied with what he had then prepared to leave, and so on the third day the English departed with the six prizes and their guns blazing keeping the Spanish at bay from a potential counterattack. Aftermath The English returned to Plymouth \\"amid great rejoicings and excitement\\" by 25 May and the haul of goods seized were counted with the Earl of Cumberland himself being present. The plunder did not consist of much treasure but over 5,000 hides, 57 chests and 64 bags of indigo, 10 chests of sugar, nearly 30 pounds of pearls, 10 tons of blockwood, nine gold buttons set with emeralds, and a single gold ingot. In addition to this were the brass cannon from the Spanish ships and other miscellaneous goods. The expedition thus was a highly successful venture and made Langton a very rich man. What's more it enabled funding for more expeditions including Walter Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition, the Preston Somers Expedition at Caracas, and the ill-fated return of Drake and Hawkins to the Caribbean the following year. Puerto Caballos would be subject to attack many times before the war's end; the last being in 1603 when Christopher Newport captured the place and held it for eighteen days.Rodger pg. 232 References ;Citations ;Bibliography  * Category:History of the Royal Navy Category:Military campaigns involving England Category:Anglo-Spanish War (1585‚Äì1604) Category:Military expeditions Category:Conflicts in 1595 Puerto Caballos Category:History of Honduras Category:1595 in Central America Category:1595 in the British Empire Category:1595 in the Spanish Empire ","title":"Raid on Puerto Caballos (1594)"},{"id":"39142988","text":"Leslie Gabriel (born 20th century) is an American volleyball coach.

She was the first baby gorilla successfully born in captivity in New York. Months after her much publicized birth, Pattycake's arm was broken when it got stuck in her cage as her mother grabbed her away from her father. The incident was sensationally anthropomorphized in the media as a domestic dispute between Lulu and Kongo, but in reality experts thought it was a simple accident. Her injury was treated at the Bronx Zoo while a custody dispute between the two zoos broke out in public and elicited a range of opinions from experts who believed Pattycake should be returned to her mother. Intense media coverage and public interest brought Pattycake to the attention of a wide audience, with stories focusing on her recovery, her eventual reunion with her parents, and the conditions of zoo animals in Central Park. An ambitious proposal for renovating the Central Park Zoo arose in the wake of the controversy while the zoo received record attendance rates. Pattycake was the \\"child star\\" of New York City in the early 1970s, and her fame was compared to Shirley Temple. At a time when New York City was facing many problems, she distracted the public from their growing anxieties and became a welcome relief for New Yorkers and their children who loved to visit her. After spending the first decade of her life at the Central Park Zoo, Pattycake moved permanently to the Bronx Zoo in 1982. She was the mother of ten baby gorillas, including twins born in 1995. Pattycake spent her later life as an independent but caring troop matriarch in the Bronx Zoo's Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit. After suffering from arthritis and cardiac problems for some time, Pattycake succumbed to heart disease in 2013.Kleinfeld, N. R.; Yee, Vivian (April 2, 2013). A Child Star With A Knack For Publicity. The New York Times. 162 (56094): 16-17. Birth \\"Pattycake\\" was born on September 3, 1972, to western lowland gorilla parents Lulu and Kongo at the Central Park Zoo. Lulu and Kongo first arrived at the zoo on May 11, 1966. At the time, it was thought that Lulu wasn't mature enough to conceive, so when Lulu gave birth to Pattycake at the age of 8, it came as a surprise. Up until the time Lulu gave birth, it had been very difficult to get captive gorilla mothers to raise their young in zoos because the babies would either be rejected by the mother or they would be taken away by the handlers. Pattycake was the first gorilla successfully born in captivity in New York. At the time of her birth, it was unknown if she was a male or female, as it was considered too dangerous to approach her and her parents.Livingston, Bernard (1974). Zoo: Animals, People, Places. Arbor House. . Her handlers assumed she was a male and originally named her \\"Sonny Jim\\".Fireman Wins Contest To Name Zoo's Gorilla. The New York Times. Oct 11, 1972. When it was established that Pattycake was a female, a contest was held by the New York Daily News to find her a name.Paddock, Barry; Hutchinson, Bill (April 1, 2013). Pattycake, beloved gorilla at the Bronx Zoo, dies at age 40. New York Daily News. \\"Patty Cake\\", the winning entry, was submitted by New York fireman John O'Connor, who named the gorilla after his wife and a proposed daughter. \\"It just so happens that we have three boys and I told my wife that if we ever have a girl, we should name her Patty, which happens to be her name. I thought we'd let the baby gorilla use the name in the meantime,\\" O'Connor told reporters.Gorilla is named Patty Cake. Associated Press. Meriden Journal. October 11, 1972. Pattycake's birth caught the attention of the city and brought crowds of thousands of New Yorkers to the Central Park Zoo. Reporter N. R. Kleinfield called her a child star whose \\"furry face served as a bit of a respite at a time when the city found itself grappling with high crime rates and an intensifying financial crisis.\\" Six months after Pattycake was born, the director of the zoo estimated that based on the crowds, she might draw an additional 500,000 visitors by the time of her first birthday.Schneider, Daniel B. (July 15, 2001). F.Y.I. We Remember Mama. The New York Times.Carmody, Deirdre (February 28, 1973). As Gorillas Go, Six-Month-Old Patty Cake Is a Charming Monkey. The New York Times. Custody dispute At the age of five months, Pattycake was sharing the Lion House with Lulu and Kongo at the Central Park Zoo. On March 20, 1973, an accident occurred that was attributed more to clumsiness than to parenting skills.Gwynne, Peter (June 28, 1973). Patty Cake comes home. New Scientist. pp. 820‚Äì821. Although no staff were on hand to see it directly, according to visitors, while little Pattycake was reaching out to her father through the bars of her cage, her right arm became stuck somehow when her mother Lulu pulled her away, breaking her right arm. Zoo handlers had to subdue Lulu with a tranquilizer dart to remove Pattycake and treat her injury.Baby Gorilla's Arm Broken in Tug-of-War. Associated Press. Reading Egale. March 21, 1973. While experts considered the incident an accident, the media sensationalized the event. Zookeeper Veronica Nelson, who worked with Patty Cake, recalled that > The news media would have liked to have it a dramatic bloody mess‚Äîa struggle > between mom and pop for the custody of the child. It was nothing like that. > It was a simple accident. Kongo was in one part of the double cage, Lulu in > another, and between them was a partition of narrow bars. Lulu had Patty > Cake in her arms and when Patty reached in between the narrow bars to touch > her father, Lulu suddenly pulled her away. But Patty's arm got caught in the > narrow bars and broke. It was a freak accident. No one ever realized that > those bars were narrow enough to catch that tiny arm. Pattycake was brought to New York Medical College for surgery and she was given a cast for her arm. Due to concerns that Lulu would try to remove Pattycake's cast, she was separated from her mother and moved to the Bronx Zoo for convalescence.Baby Gorilla, Arm In Cast, Recuperating. Associated Press. The Morning Record. March 22, 1973. Pattycake was treated by veterinarian Emil Dolensek who later replaced her cast with a sling. After an examination, the staff discovered that Pattycake had intestinal parasites and determined she was underfed. They also believed that as a result of the incident, Lulu wasn't capable as a mother. A custody dispute began between the two zoos, with the Bronx Zoo arguing that she would be better cared for in their facilities. Time magazine noted that it was the \\"custody battle of the decade\\" in the \\"primate world\\", comparing Patty Cake's popularity and fame to that of child star Shirley Temple.Untitled. Time, (102)1. July 2, 1973. \\"In the primate world, it was the custody battle of the decade: a tug of war between two New York zoos for Patty Cake, the Shirley Temple of gorillas.\\" Developmental biologist Ronald Nadler of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center was brought in to arbitrate the dispute and published a report that favored returning Pattycake to her mother and the Central Park Zoo.Nadler, Ronald D. (June 6, 1973). Excerpts From Report on Custody of the Baby Gorilla. The New York Times. In his report Nadler noted that \\"the recommendation is based on the judgment that an infant gorilla is more likely to develop into a socially competent and reproductively adequate animal if it is raised in the company of its parents as opposed to being raised with a group of peers.\\"Psychologist sends gorilla home. UPI. The Deseret News. June 6, 1973. p. 6A. After three months recuperating from her injuries, Pattycake was returned to her mother on June 15, 1973.Nadler, Ronald D.; Green, Susan (January 1975) Separation and reunion of a gorilla infant and mother. International Zoo Yearbook 15(1): 198-201. The entire incident was documented by artist Susan Green in her book Gentle Gorilla: The Story of Patty Cake (1978). Central Park Zoo conditions By the 1970s, animal welfare organizations began to voice their increasing concern with the treatment of zoo animals and the conditions of their enclosures at the Central Park Zoo. The Humane Society of the United States, the Friends of the Zoo, and the Society for Animal Rights decried the prison- like conditions of the cages and called for immediate changes. The New York Zoological Society, which was responsible for creating realistic habitat enclosures at the Bronx Zoo, also began calling for changes and for Pattycake to be moved to another zoo.Ferreti, Fred (March 28, 1977). The Zoo Story. New York Magazine, 10(13): 46-49. A renovation plan for the Central Park Zoo was approved in 1981, with plans made to move the gorillas to larger spaces in other zoos. The New York Times reported that \\"the caging of these animals in inadequate spaces has long enraged animal lovers.\\" Bronx Zoo Pattycake moved permanently to the Bronx Zoo on December 20, 1982, just before the Central Park Zoo closed for renovations in 1983. For a few years, she lived in a cage with Pansy, a chimpanzee. In June 1999, Pattycake moved into the Wildlife Conservation Society's $43 million Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit.O'Shaughnessy, Patrice (June 22, 1999). Reach Out & Touch A Gorilla; Zoo Brings Rain Forest To Our Backyard. New York Daily News. The exhibit includes a Great Gorilla Forest viewing area that separates gorillas and visitors with a glass window. Two troops of gorillas inhabited the 6.5 acre exhibit, with a dozen gorillas in Pattycake's troop alone, including Fubo, Pattycake, Tunko, Triska, Halima, Fran, Layla, Kumi, Suki, Babatunde, Barbara, and M'domo.Congo Gorilla Forest 10th Anniversary Fact Sheet. Wildlife Conservation Society. 2009.Jaccarino, Mike (July 5, 2009). Bronx Zoo's gorilla exhibit celebrates 10th anniversary. New York Daily News. The general curator of the Bronx Zoo, James Doherty, described Pattycake as \\"independent\\" with \\"few close friends\\" in the Congo Gorilla Forest. \\"It may have something to do with the fact that she didn't live with her parents that long, and lived with that chimpanzee for a few years,\\" Doherty said.

As the name indicates the events center around the various championships promoted by IWRG. The 2011 event was the third overall show IWRG has held under the Caravana de Campeones banner. For the 2011 event Comando Negro defeated Dr. Cerebro to win the IWRG Intercontinental Lightweight Championship, the third time in three shows that a new lightweight champion was crowned. Also on the show Los Piratas (El Hijo de Pirata Morgan and Pirata Morgan) successfully defended the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship against El Brazo and El Veneo and the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Champions Los Oficiales (Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro) successfully fended off Los Perros del Mal (\\"The Bad Dogs\\"; Bestia 666, Dami√°n 666 and X-Fly). Production Background Professional wrestling has a long running tradition of holding shows that feature several championship matches, and at times actually promotes shows as an \\"all championship matches\\" show. The earliest documented \\"All-Championship\\" show is the EMLL Carnaval de Campeones (\\"Carnival of Champions\\") held on January 13, 1965. In 2007 WWE held a pay-per-view called Vengeance: Night of Champions, making WWE Night of Champions a recurring theme. Starting in 2008 the Mexican lucha libre promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) has held a regular major show labeled Caravana de Campeones, Spanish for \\"Caravan of Champions\\" using the same concept for a major annual show. All Caravana de Campeones shows have been held in Arena Naucalpan, IWRG's home arena, the location of all of their major shows through the years. The 2011 show was the third time IWRG has held a Caravana de Campeones show, having not held one in 2010. Storylines The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers, where some were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines and others simply put together by the matchmakers without a backstory. Being a professional wrestling event matches are not won legitimately through athletic competition; they are instead won via predetermined outcomes to the matches that is kept secret from the general public. Wrestlers portray either heels (the bad guys, referred to as Rudos in Mexico) or faces (fan favorites or T√©cnicos in Mexico). Dr. Cerebro had defeated Japanese wrestler Tetsuya Bushi to win the IWRG Intercontinental Lightweight Championship for the first time on January 10, 2010, becoming the seventh wrestler overall to hold the championship. Since winning the title he successfully defended it against El Hijo del Diablo and El Hijo del Pantera as well as winning the WWS World Welterweight Championship in a match where both championships were on the line. The father/son team of El Hijo de Pirata Morgan (Literally \\"the son of Pirata Mogan\\") and Pirata Morgan, collectively known as Los Piratas won the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship for the second time when they defeated the Los Junior Dinamitas team of El Hijo del Cien Caras and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. on November 14, 2010. In the weeks leading up the Caravana de Campeones show it looked like their next challengers would be the team of El Brazo and El Brazo Jr., a masked wrestler who had paid for the use of the name and was not actually a biological son of El Brazo, but when the show was announced El Brazo was teamed up with El Veneno to challenge for the championship. Los Oficiales (Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro) had won the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship from the team of Cyborg, Kraneo and Xibalva on September 29, 2008 and held it for a total of days prior to the 2011 Caravana de Campeones show. The trio had multiple successful title defense in that period of time, including a successful defense against Arlequ√≠n, Hijo de Pierroth and Pierroth II at the 2009 Caravana de Campeones show. In mid-2010 rival Mexican wrestling promotion AAA began working with IWRG, creating an \\"invasion storyline\\" where wrestlers from AAA would invade Arena Naucalpan and IWRG wrestlers would show up at AAA events. Los Oficiales defended the IWRG side on several occasions, defending the trios championship against AAA teams of Aero Star, Gato Everready and Laredo Kid as well as Amadeus, Gran Apache and Taboo. In the fall of 2010 the Perros del Mal promotion joined in as a third faction in the storyline. the father/son team of Dami√°n 666 and Bestia 666 was joined by X-Fly to challenge Los Oficiales, promising that they would end Los Oficiales multi-year reign. Aftermath Los Oficiales marathon reign with the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship was ended just over a month later, ending it at 886 days when AAA representatives Los Maniacos (Joe L√≠der, Silver King and √öltimo Gladiador) defeated them on March 30, 2011. Los Piratas second reign with the tag team championship came to an end on March 18, just a month and a half after their successful defense at the Caravana de Campeons. The team lost to the father/son team of Negro Navarro and Trauma I. Comando Negro's reign as the IWRG Intercontinental Lightweight Championship lasted until November 3, 2011 when he lost the belt to Dinamic Black. Comando Negro would later be given a new masked ring character, \\"Canis Lupus\\". The lightweight championship was also defended at the April version of the 2012 Caravana de Campeones show, which marked the first time it was successfully defended at a Caravana de Campeones show when Carta Brava Jr. defeated Chicano.

Jorck built the Jorcks Passage complex when the company ran out of space at their old building. He commissioned Vilhelm Dahlerup to design the building which was constructed between 1893 and 1895. KTAS KTAS opened their first telephone exchange in the premises in 1896. Literally thousands of telephone wires extended from a structure on the roof to customers in the vicinity.

It was the fifth time IWRG had held a Guerra del Golfo event since 2002, making it an annual event from 2005 and forward. The annual Guerra del Golfo main event consists of three matches in total, with two \\"qualifying matches\\", multi-man steel cage matches where the last person left in the cage advances to the main event of the night. The two losers would then be forced to wrestle inside the steel cage, with the loser of that match being forced to either take off their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet match\\" rules, if they are unmasked. Production Background Starting as far back as at least 2000, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2005 IWRG has promoted a spring time show promoting the steel cage match concept under the name Guerra del Golfo, or \\"Gulf War\\", referring to the Gulf of Mexico, not the Gulf War in the middle east. The Gurerra del Golfo shows featured two \\"qualifying\\" steel cage matches where the loser would later be forced to face off against each other in the main event of the show, a final cage match where the loser would be forced to either unmask or have his/her hair shaved off. The use of the steel cage in three matches distinguishes the Guerra del Golfo event from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\") or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Guerra del Golfo shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2011 Castillo del Terror show was the fifth year IWRG promoted a show under that name and the fourth year in a row since becoming an annual event from 2008 forward. Storylines The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The Main Event was a 12-Man Steel Cage Match. The last two wrestlers who remained in the ring fought one on one in a Lucha de Apuestas Match (\\"Bet match\\"), wagering their mask on the outcome of the match. The event included wrestlers from International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) as well as a number of Mexican freelance wrestlers.

He won the inaugural running of Britain's foremost flat race, The Derby, on Diomed, one of the most influential horses in Thoroughbred history, and won again on a further three occasions. Career Arnull hailed from a family of jockeys that dominated British horse racing in the latter part of the 18th century and early 19th. He was the younger brother of John Arnull and uncle of Bill Arnull. Between them, the family won twelve Derbies in the race's formative years. He himself won four of them ‚Äî 1780 (Diomed), 1782 (Assassin), 1787 (Sir Peter Teazle), 1798 (Sir Harry) ‚Äî as well as an Oaks on Hermione in 1794. Such was their dominance that \\"Newmarket [the home of British racing] without an Arnull would ... have seemed strange\\" Sam was described as a \\"quiet and unassuming man\\" and was a man of some means, being able to ride out at hunts on well-turned out horses, with a well-dressed groom. He and his family were known for being more trustworthy than other jockeys of the day. Although his brother won more Derbies, Sam was perhaps the better of the two; when he died in 1800 he \\"is supposed not to have left a better\\" His dedication to the sport was certainly undoubted. For example, in spite of the fact he found that \\"wasting was a sore burden ... [he] performed the unrivalled feat of knocking off 7 lbs in a single day\\" to meet the weight for a horse he wanted to ride.  1780 Derby  The inaugural running of the Derby was low key compared to the event which it was to become. At the time it merited but a small notice in the London Evening Post of 6 May 1780 but in retrospect was said to have \\"fairly caught hold on the public imagination\\". Arnull is said to have been seen going to post wearing: His main rival in the race was Colonel O'Kelly's Boudrow, also recorded as Budroo, who came in second. Diomed, owned by Sir Charles Bunbury, won at odds of 6/4. The breeches that Arnull wore on the day now hang inside the Jockey Club. At Nottingham the following year, suspicion turned on Arnull when Diomed lost to what was considered \\"a very far inferior horse\\", losing Bunbury a large sum of money. The defeat sickened Bunbury and was a factor in Diomed's retirement.  Death  Arnull died in Newmarket in 1800.

Two lighthouses were commissioned in 1830 in response to requests from the Coastguards who were concerned at the sea conditions at Blackrock, further south. The Board inspector, however, ruled in favour of locating the new lighthouses on Eagle Island, one in the east and the other in the west, with between them, at a cost of almost ¬£40,000 (roughly ¬£ or ‚Ç¨ in ). Their lights were aligned at a height of above sea level and could be seen to the east as far as Broadhaven Bay and to the south as far as Blacksod Bay. The lighthouses became operational in September 1835. Eagle Island is located close to the edge of the Continental Shelf and is constantly pounded by powerful waves from the Atlantic. When the lighthouses were first built in the 19th century there were two lighthouses and seven dwelling houses on Eagle Island, according to the 1841 census. By the 1911 census there was only one dwelling house listed on the island. Despite the erection of a massive storm wall to protect the lighthouses, one of the lighthouses was destroyed by the severe storms and its remains still litter the ground it used to stand on. Although the lighthouse sites sit almost above the high water mark, during a severe storm on 17 January 1836, a rock was thrown up the cliffs and smashed the glass in a window high up in the tower building. On 11 March 1861 at midday the light room of the East tower was struck by a rogue wave, smashing 23 panes, washing some of the lamps down the stairs, and damaging the reflectors with broken glass beyond repair. The light was restored the following night with a reduced number of lamps and reflectors. So much water cascaded down the tower in the incident that it was impossible for the Keepers to open the door at the base, and they had to drill holes in it to let the water out. Storms constantly batter the lighthouse at Eagle Island and gradually it was realised that Eagle Island was not well suited to human habitation. The families on the island were rehoused near to Corclough on the mainland at the end of the 19th century, although lighthouse keepers remained resident. On 31 March 1988 the lighthouse was made automatic and there have been no lighthouse keepers resident on the island since.

The disappearance became one of the most publicized criminal cases in post-war Norway.  Disappearance  The girl disappeared while hitchhiking towards the center of Lesja on Tuesday afternoon, 10 February 1987. She was going to meet her boyfriend at a caf√©, but never arrived. Witnesses had seen her hitchhiking along the European route E136, and the police became certain that she had been the victim of a violent crime. KRIPOS were soon involved and area searches were carried out without result. The police directed their attention to a Ford motor vehicle. On 4 March, the police released composite sketches of two men, but still made no real progress with the case. On 21 March, the body of her was found on a slope along Dyrkornstranda, in the municipality of Stordal, in the district of Sunnm√∏re. The autopsy showed that she had first been raped, then strangled. Investigators carried out door-to-door enquiries in the district and received information concerning a 37-year-old man and a divorced father of four. He was known to have a troubled and violent past and drove an old Ford Granada. He was arrested on 29 April 1987 and immediately confessed to the murder. During his trial, a 30-year-old woman came forward and said that he had violently abused and raped her on 11 April 1987. During the attack, he had told her that he was responsible for the Lesja murder. The woman said that she had been too terrified to go to the police, only coming forward when he admitted in court to having assaulted an unidentified woman.  Sentencing and aftermath  He pleaded guilty and on 17 October 1987 was sentenced to 21 years in prison in addition to 10 years confinement for premeditated murder, rape, abduction and the use of violent force. In February 1988, the sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Norway rejecting his appeal. He hanged himself in his cell in Gj√∏vik Prison on the morning of 17 March 1988 by using bed sheets. Two suicide notes left behind suggested that his decision to take his own life had been deliberate.

While no authoritative biographies of Luang Pu Mun credit him with authorship later editions of the text began naming him as author and picturing him on the cover. The text has also been attributed to maechi Khunying Yai Damrongthammasan.

He bounced back and regained the British Commonwealth title back from Snuka in December 1992, in which he held for over a year before losing it to Fit Finlay. In July 1994, he teamed with Steve Casey to defeat Finlay and John Hawk to win the vacant CWA World Tag Team Championship. They lost the championship two weeks later to The Wrecking Crew. In August 1994, St. Clair regained the British Commonwealth Championship from Finlay. He reigned as champion for eleven months before losing the title to Franz Schumann in July 1995, although he regained the title later that year. In December 1995, he teamed with August Smisl to defeat Hawk and Cannonball Grizzly to win the CWA World Tag Team Championship, but they vacated the championship two days later when Smisl suffered an injury. In July 1997, he teamed with Ulf Hermann to win his fourth and final CWA World Tag Team Championship, defeating Robbie Brookside and Mark The Hunter to win the vacant championship. They reigned for more than three months, before losing the belts to Jean-Pierre LaFitte and Rhino Richards. In October 1998, St. Clair won the CWA Submission Shootfighting Championship. After reigning three years on his fourth reign as CWA British Commonwealth Champion, he finally lost the title to Robbie Brookside, although he regained the title from him one week later, as well as winning the CWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. The CWA would fold in December 1999 with St. Clair holding three championship at once. New Japan Pro Wrestling (1979‚Äì1995) St. Clair made his Japanese debut in January 1979 for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). He would become one of the top gaijin superstars in Japan. Starting out in their junior heavyweight division, St. Clair had a shot at the WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship in May 1985, but lost to champion Hiro Saito. He also participated in the inaugural Top of the Super Juniors tournament in 1988; he placed in ninth place with 14 points. He wrestled for NJPW until 1995. Final years and retirement (1997‚Äì2006) In 1997, St. Clair began competing for various promotions throughout Europe, including Verband Der Berufsringer, Independent Wrestling World, European Wrestling Promotion, German Wrestling Alliance, Deutsche Wrestling Allianz, and Professional Wrestling Alliance. In 2001 and 2002, he returned to NJPW as part of Osamu Nishimura's MUGA. In 2006, he was planning to join MUGA in August as a wrestler and trainer, but on 5 July he suffered a stroke and had to pull out. Shortly afterward, he retired after 40 years in the business.

He is the No. 7 ranked German player as of October 2017. Born in Zittau, Bindrich became a FIDE Master at the age of 13. He earned his International Master title in 2006 and his grandmaster title a year later. He played in the 2008 Chess Olympiad, held in Dresden, where his German team placed 13th. He has competed in several other prestigious chess events, such as the 2008 Bundesliga and the 2010 Chess Olympiad. Early life Falko Bindrich was born on 17 October 1990 in Zittau, Germany, to parents Zdena and Oswald Bindrich. His father, Oswald Bindrich (born 1951), was an expert-level chess player, with a highest Elo rating of 2212. In 1993, at the age of three, Falko was taught chess by his brother and soon after, his father, Oswald, enrolled him the Oberland Chess Club. In 1998, he entered for the German Youth Individual Championship (under nine) and placed 28th out of 80 participants. After achieving second place in the 1999 German Youth U10 Individual Championship, he was allowed to attend the U10 European Championship where he finished only 39th. After this disappointment, he asked his father, Oswald, how he could improve, and he set him on a daily training regimen with him and later consulted with stronger German players. In late 1999, he reached 1400 Elo, whereby his training sessions were extended and held with the likes of grandmasters Lubomir Ftacnik and Zigurds Lanka. In 2000, he reached second place in the German Youth Individual Championship (under ten) and travelled to Spain for the U10 World Cup, where he placed seventeenth. By 2001, aged 11, Falko was rated 2054 fide and had achieved first place in the German Youth Individual Championship U12. In 2002, Bindrich defeated Hungarian International Master Attila Parkanyi and in September, also defeated Swedish grandmaster Tiger Hillarp Persson in F√ºrth at the Pyramid Cup. In October 2002 he delivered an outstanding performance of 2500+ in the Czech Open Championship. In 2003, Bindrich became the youngest German player to receive the FIDE master title, after crossing 2300 fide. Chess career Bindrich playing the 2008 Chess Olympiad In late 2003, Bindrich came in fifth in the German Youth Championship U18 which got him elected to the German Under-18 team. He gained his first International Master norm in 2004 for the B national team in the Mitropa Cup. After this he attended tournaments in several Eastern countries, such as Krakow, Budapest, Moscow and Riga. Later that year Bindrich supported the German Cancer Society by holding a simultaneous exhibition. In 2005, he earned his second IM norm in a grandmaster tournament in Crimea. Bindrich settled first place in his first adult event in the early January 2006 Staufer Open and a few days later in Geneva, he earned his 3rd and final IM norm, and was awarded the International Master title. With 11.0/15 and an Elo performance of 2670 for the SC Remagen event, he secured his first Grandmaster norm. He gained his second GM norm in the European Championships 2007. By spring 2007, Bindrich had crossed 2500 fide and had met all of the requirements for the grandmaster title and became GM-elect. In October 2007, he was given the grandmaster title. At the age of 16, he was the youngest German ever to achieve the grandmaster title and was given the honorary title of Zittau and signed in the Golden Book of the city. Bindrich attended the 12th Neckar Open in 2008 and finished first out of over 300 participants, with 7¬Ω/9, finishing only half a point ahead of Leon Hoyos, Dgebuadze, Lauber, Graf, Kr√§mer, Peralta, Chatalbashev, Erdos, and Fedorchuk, who all finished the tournament with 7.0/9. He also played for Germany in the 2008 Chess Olympiad, held in Dresden, where his team placed 13th out of 146 overall teams. In 2011, Bindrich became CEO of the Amateur Chess Organization (ACO), alongside international master Tobias Hirneise. Bindrich played in and won the 2011 April Budapest event despite there being no prizes offered there, with 6¬Ω/9. There he defeated his fellow countryman Natsidis Cristoph, who only needed a draw to reach an IM norm. He also won the Luzern Open 2011 Group A section tournament, with 5¬Ω/7 in November 2011. During the fourth round of the 2011 German Chess Championships, Falko Bindrich was late to his game and tournament director Ralph Alt declared the game lost on Bindrich's arrival after a few minutes. Bindrich refused to accept the penalty and withdrew from the tournament shortly after, and went on to blog about the double standards of arbiters, claiming that he had seen several other players arrive late in the previous rounds, and no penalty was issued to them. Since the October Bundesliga issue, Bindrich has appeared in the Austrian Team Championship, where he scored 6 out of 8, and the 36th Zurich Christmas Open, where he came in as shared second place ahead of 133 players. 2012 Bundesliga cheating accusations In M√ºlheim, in the first round of the 2012 German Bundesliga on 20 October 2012, Falko Bindrich defeated the strong 2600+ Elo grandmaster Pavel Tregubov in an English Symmetrical: Botvinnik system. :Bindrich‚ÄìTregubov 1.Nf3 c5 2.c4 Nc6 3.Nc3 e5 4.g3 g6 5.Bg2 Bg7 6.a3 Nge7 7.0-0 0-0 8.d3 d6 9.Rb1 a5 10.Bd2 h6 11.Ne1 Be6 12.Nc2 d5 13.cxd5 Nxd5 14.Ne3 Nde7 15.Na4 b6 16.b4 cxb4 17.axb4 b5 18.Nc5 Ba2 19.bxa5 Bxb1 20.Qxb1 Ra7 21.Qxb5 Nd4 22.Qb6 Nc8 23.Qxd8 Nxe2 24.Kh1 Rxd8 25.Nc4 Nd4 26.Rb1 Bf8 27.Nb7 Re8 28.Be3 f6 29.f4 Ra6 30.fxe5 fxe5 31.Bd5 Kh7 32.g4 Nc2 33.Bd2 Ne7 34.Be4 Ng8 35.Rb6 Rxb6 36.axb6 Bb4 37.Nbd6 Rb8 38.Bxb4 Nxb4 39.b7 Nf6 40.Nxe5 Nxe4 41.dxe4 Rd8 42.Nec4 Kg7 43.e5 Nc6 44.Kg2 Kf8 45.Kf3 Ke7 46.Ke4 Ke6 47.Nb5 Rd1 48.Na5 Re1 49.Kd3 Nb8 50.Nc6 Rd1 51.Kc2 Nxc6 52.Kxd1 Kxe5 53.Ke2 h5 54.Kf3 Nb8 55.h4 Kd5 56.g5 Kc6 57.Nd4 Kxb7 58.Ke4 Nd7 59.Kd5 Kc8 60.Ke6 Kc7 61.Nf3 At the end of the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov refused to shake his hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would complain to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the referee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game. :Siebrecht‚ÄìBindrich 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.a3 e4 5.Ng5 Qe7 6.e3 h6 7.Nh3 g5 8.Qc2 Bg7 9.Ng1 0-0 10.Nge2 1‚Äì0 Bindrich later fervently denied cheating, and released a five- page document, declaring his innocence, stating that his smartphone was always switched off. He claimed to not use the bathroom any more than usual and that several others did so too without penalty. Bindrich denied that he went to the toilet on his turn, saying that there were witnesses there who could confirm this. He stated that, in his game with Tregubov, \\"... after reaching a clear advantage I didn't play the best way possible, as anyone who plays through the game at home can easily establish\\" and Tregubov had played the same opening three weeks earlier against Andrei IstrƒÉ»õescu, and that he'd looked up the theory to the line that was played. He also questioned \\"Is it really so unlikely that a grandmaster with 2530 Elo wins with white against a grandmaster with 2600 Elo?\\" and complained that the search was an invasion of privacy. The team he was playing for, SC Eppingen went on to lose overall to Katernberg 3¬Ω‚Äì4¬Ω. The use of a chess engine was never proven, but as a result of his actions, the German Chess Federation issued a 2-year suspension from play. Bindrich issued a statement saying that he did not accept the decision of the board, and issued an appeal against the decision of the President of the German Chess Federation. On 2 May 2013, the arbitration court of the German Chess Federation cancelled the ban, stating it was issued without legal basis.

It is located in Tait≈ç nearby the Sens≈ç-ji temple. It operates out of the same building as the old Takasago stable, before it merged with the Wakamatsu stable. It was set up in September 2004 by former sekiwake Masudayama, who branched off from Kasugano stable of the Dewanoumi ichimon at the unusually late age of 53, after he lost out to Tochinowaka in his bid to take over Kasugano stable. He took four wrestlers with him from Kasugano stable, the last of whom, Burinosato, retired in March 2019. It is home to the only Hungarian in professional sumo, Masutoo, who was on the podium at the 2004 Junior Sumo World Championships alongside Tochinoshin, Goeido and Kaisei but has yet to progress beyond the makushita division in professional sumo. In April 2016 the former Takamisugi took over the running of the stable when ex-Masudayama reached the mandatory retirement age of 65, and aligned the stable with the Takanohana ichimon, leaving the Dewanoumi ichimon. The former Chiganoura changed to Tokiwayama and was re- employed by the stable as a consultant for five years. As of January 2020 it had 13 wrestlers. In June 2018 the Takanohana ichimon dissolved and Chiganoura joined the ≈ånomatsu group, with ex-Masudayama choosing to be unaffiliated. In September, the stable joined the Nishonoseki group and on 1 October Chiganoura adopted the wrestlers and staff from the defunct Takanohana stable following the resignation of Takanohana from the Japan Sumo Association. In November Takakeisho won the top division championship in his first tournament for his new stable, and March 2019 was promoted to ≈çzeki. Ring name conventions Many wrestlers at this stable take ring names or shikona that begin with the character Ëàõ (read: masu), in deference to their former coach and the stable's founder, the former Masudayama. Examples include Masunosho, Masutoo and Masutenryu. However, when Masunosho was promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division after the September 2017 tournament his shikona was changed to Takanosho, after the new head coach Takamisugi.

It is located at the mouth of the Wadi Araba, a major communication corridor between the Nile Valley and the Red Sea, crossing the Eastern Desert. The site is across the Gulf of Suez from the small Sinai fortress of Tell Ras Budran. A somewhat similar ancient port is at Ain Sukhna, a little north of Wadi al-Jarf. The site was first discovered by J. G. Wilkinson in 1832. It was rediscovered by a French team in the 1950s, who named it Rod el-Khawaga. Archeological work was quickly abandoned when the Suez Crisis broke out in 1956. A joint French‚ÄìEgyptian team resumed excavation in 2011. The harbor at the site dates to the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, approximately 4,500 years ago. Also discovered at the site were more than 100 anchors, the first Old Kingdom anchors found in their original context, and numerous storage jars. The jars have been linked with those of another site across the Red Sea, indicating trade between the two sites. A large number of papyrus fragments were found at Wadi al-Jarf, providing insight into life during the Fourth Dynasty. The papyri are the oldest ever found in Egypt. Discovery The first known documentation of ancient harbor structures at Wadi al-Jarf was in 1832, when J. G. Wilkinson noted their existence. He discovered a series of galleries cut into the stone which he believed to be Greek catacombs. In the 1950s, a group of French amateurs in archeology began to explore some parts of the site, which they named Rod el-Khawaga, but they were expelled during the 1956 Suez Crisis. Their notes were published in 2008, spurring interest to resume work. Systematic excavation resumed in 2011 by a joint Egyptian‚ÄìFrench archeological team led by Pierre Tallet (University Paris IV-La Sorbonne) and Gregory Marouard (The Oriental Institute, Chicago). In April 2013, archaeologists announced the discovery of an ancient harbor and dozens of papyrus documents at the location. Those are the oldest papyri ever found in Egypt (ca. 2560‚Äì2550 BC, end of the reign of Khufu). Artifacts Harbor The harbor complex consists of a ca. mole or jetty of stones that is still visible at low tide (), an alamat or navigational landmark made of heaped stones, a building of unknown function that is divided into 13 long rooms, and a series of 25 to 30 storage galleries carved into limestone outcrops further inland. The building of unknown function is the largest pharaonic building discovered to date along the Red Sea coast. The storage galleries are between long, and are usually wide and tall. Inside the galleries lay several boat and sail fragments, some oars, and numerous pieces of ancient rope. Twenty-five stone anchors were found under water, and 99 anchors were found in an apparent storage building. The discovery of anchors in their original context is a first in Old Kingdom archeology. Many of the anchors bear hieroglyphs, likely representing the names of the boats from which they came. The port was the starting point for voyages from mainland Egypt to South Sinai mining operations. It is speculated that the harbor may have also been used to launch voyages to \\"the mysterious Land of Punt\\", a known trading partner of Egypt. The harbor was developed in the reign of the Pharaoh Khufu (2589‚Äì2566 B.C.), whose name is inscribed on some of the heavy limestone blocks at the site. That means the harbor predates the second-oldest known port structure by more than 1,000 years. There is some trace evidence of use during the early part of Fifth Dynasty, after which the harbor was likely abandoned. Storage jars and papyri Numerous stone food and water storage jars, textile and wood fragments, and a collection of hundreds of papyrus fragments were also found at the site. Many of the jars feature names of people or boats in red ink, indicating their owners. The jars are characterized by a very particular marl composition which had previously been identified in Fourth Dynasty contexts at other sites, including across the Gulf of Suez at Tell Ras Budran. Ten of the papyri are especially very well preserved. The majority of these documents date to the year after the 13th cattle count of Khufu's reign and describe how the central administration sent food and supplies to Egyptian travelers. One document is of special interest: the Diary of Merer, an official involved in the building of the Great Pyramid of Khufu. Using the diary, researchers reconstructed three months of his life, providing new insight into everyday lives of people of the Fourth Dynasty. The papyri are the oldest ever found in Egypt. Residences Three groups of buildings were found to the northwest of the harbor. The rectangular construction and organization of rooms into a cell-like pattern indicated the buildings served as dwelling places.

Moxley was an American politician and businessman in Howard County, Maryland  Early life  Norman Moxley was born in 1905. He grew up on his family's 800 acre farm near the prison in Ellicott City, Maryland. Early jobs included being a blacksmith and later founding a plastering company in the 1920s. He married Evelyn Richarts in 1926. In 1944 Moxley was an airplane spotter assigned to post 25A on Columbia Pike. In 1949, he ran for one of the three County Commissioner positions and won. The next year he was the chairman. Commissioner - Councilman Moxley's first tenure as a Howard County Commissioner was in 1949. He became president of the board of Commissioners becoming the equivalent of the modern-day County Executive. In 1951 he became the Chairman of the Planning Commission In 1952, Moxley was opposed to new housing, being quoted as saying \\"each new house is a liability to the county\\". He felt that commercial development provided more revenue to the county with less infrastructure and service burdens. In 1953, Moxley approved taking a $514,000 state loan for new school construction, with future commissioner Charles E. Miller chosen for site purchases. During the November 1954 election, Moxley's brother Howard County Police Chief E. Russell Moxley and Max A. Rappaport were charged with electioneering, requiring the Maryland State police to intercede, but all charges were later dropped in a Howard County Court. In 1958, while in office, Moxley patented (US 2,860,753) a coin- operated machine for collecting parking fines. The machine was intended to rapidly issue a ticket and receive payment on the spot \\"to relieve the charged with the hassle of driving to the police station to pay the fine\\". Moxley served as Chairman until 1962. In 1962, Moxley attempted to run for a fourth term, but was rejected by Democrats to run in the position. He ran an unsuccessful bid as an independent, losing to Charles E. Miller, J. Hubert Black, and David W. Force. In 1966, Moxley attempted to run again for the new position of Howard County Council. He won the primary with 3031 votes on a slate with Thomas J. Nissel, losing the general to a sweep of Republican incumbents. He ran again in 1968 on a United ticket. Norman Moxley kept family ties within the Howard County Council. In 1966, his niece's husband Ridgley Jones was elected to a seat on the county council. Businessman - Land Developer  In 1930, Moxley opened his first Acme retail store. He later founded a plastering company that operated until 1949. In 1945, he developed his first shopping center, The Arbutis Shopping Center. His second shopping center was in Glen Burnie with an Acme anchor. In July 1955 Moxley formed the Normandy Development company, and subdivided his own land in Howard County on Highland Road and Rogers Avenue to build the Normandy Heights housing development in Ellicott City, Maryland. In 1956, Moxley teamed with family members James R. Moxley, Sr., Robert R. Moxley and James R. Moxley, Jr. forming Normandy Development Company to create Normandy Shopping Center, Howard County's first shopping center which opened on 1 September 1961. \\"Normandy\\" was a spin on Norman's name. The shopping center and Normandy housing development were built on the 800 acres of farmland that had been in the family since the 1800s. Moxley also was on the Farm Bureau, President of the Rotary Club, member of the Planning Committee of the National Association of County Commissioners, Baltimore Regional Planning Council and Howard County Planning Commission. He served on the board of officers in the Mt Etna Corporation. His brother-in-law's brother (Paul Stromberg) published 13 newspapers spanning Howard County to Anne Arundel, Baltimore and Carrol County.  Other  The Moxley family occupied many positions in the Howard County Government. Norman Moxley's brother, James R. Moxley Sr. started with the School board as a bus contractor in Ellicott City in 1939, bidding against Charles E. Miller. He later sold a prime parcel to James Rouse as Robert Moxley assembled properties for the planned community development of Columbia, Maryland. In 1972 Moxley was the Chairman of the public works board. His county approved purchases of gasoline from Councilman Charles E. Miller's Ellicott City business caught press attention at the time. Moxley's son Norman Moxley, Jr. was one of the first users of the Rain Dream Hill facility founded by Arc of Howard County. Moxley died of stroke complications in 1995 at the age of 90 at the Bon Secours Nursing Center.

Fifteen people were killed, more than 160 were injured, and more than 150 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Investigators confirmed that ammonium nitrate was the material that exploded. On May 11, 2016, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives stated that the fire had been deliberately set. Background West Fertilizer Company had supplied chemicals to farmers since it was founded in 1962. it was owned by Adair Grain, Inc. and employed nine workers at the facility. Adair Grain, Inc. is wholly owned by Donald Adair and his wife Wanda. At the time of the incident, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) had last inspected the plant in 1985. According to records obtained by the Associated Press, OSHA cited the plant for improper storage of anhydrous ammonia and fined it $30. OSHA could have fined the company as much as $1,000. OSHA also cited the plant for violations of respiratory protection standards, but did not impose a fine. OSHA officials said the facility was not on their \\"National Emphasis Plan\\" for inspections, because it was not a manufacturer, had no record of a major accident, and the Environmental Protection Agency did not consider it a major risk. Map of West, Texas After a complaint in 2006 about an ammonia smell coming from the facility, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigated and cited the operator for not having a permit for two storage tanks that contained anhydrous ammonia. A permit was issued once the operators brought the facility into accord with agency regulations and recommendations. Also in 2006, the EPA fined the owners $2,300 for problems that included not filing a risk management program plan on time.EPA Envirofacts Warehouse. Iaspub.epa.gov. Retrieved on April 19, 2013.Smith, Matt. Records: Texas plant hadn't told feds about explosive fertilizer. CNN, April 26, 2013. In June 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration further fined the facility $5,250 for violations regarding anhydrous ammonia storage. According to an open records request by Reuters, the plant had a long history of minor thefts, presumably by people wanting to use anhydrous ammonia to make methamphetamine. The facility lacked burglar alarms, or even a fenced perimeter. It installed a surveillance system in 2009 after law enforcement recommended they do so.Selam Gebrekidan and Joshua Schneyer. \\"Exclusive: At Texas fertilizer plant, a history of theft, tampering\\". Reuters, May 3, 2013. In an emergency planning report filed with the EPA in 2011, company officials said the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks did not represent a significant fire or explosion hazard. Indeed, the tanks were still intact following the nearby fire and explosion. According to its last filing with the EPA in late 2012, the company stated that it stored of ammonium nitrate and of anhydrous ammonia on the site. A week after the explosion, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told Senate investigators that the company did not appear to have disclosed its ammonium nitrate stock to her department. Federal law requires that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) be notified whenever anyone has more than one ton of ammonium nitrate on hand, or if the ammonium nitrate is combined with combustible material. Fire and explosion The facility caught fire on Wednesday, April 17, 2013, and roughly 20 minutes after the fire was first reported to emergency dispatchers the site exploded. At 7:50:38 p.m. CDT (00:50 UTC, April 18), as firefighters were attempting to douse the flames, it exploded with the force of 7.5-10 tons of TNT.Adair Grain Inc., DBA West Fertilizer Co., EPA Facility Registry System The explosion created a 93 foot wide crater where the site of the fertilizer plant had previously been, and resulted in 15 deaths and numerous injuries. After weeks of investigation, the cause of the initial fire remained unknown; authorities ruled out weather, natural causes, anhydrous ammonia, and ammonium nitrate in a rail car as possible causes. In May 2016, the ATF announced that they had determined the fire had been deliberately set. However, this finding is widely disputed. No arrests were ever made. No suspects were ever named. Legal and forensic experts have criticized the ATF investigation. Aftermath USGS ground level intensity map for the event The massive explosion obliterated the West Fertilizer Company plant and caused heavy damage and further destruction to surrounding areas. Numbers for people dead or injured varied initially. Damage In addition to the obliterated plant, the damaged buildings included the public West Middle School, which sits next to the facility. A neighboring 50-unit, two-story apartment building was destroyed. The blast damaged the nearby West Rest Haven nursing home, and many residents were evacuated. Many of the nursing home residents received cuts from flying glass, but emergency personnel on scene judged that most of these injuries were not life-threatening. On April 20, some residents who tried to return to their destroyed homes were turned away, because leaking gas tanks were causing small fires. According to the company's insurer, United States Fire Insurance of Morristown, New Jersey, the facility was only covered by $1 million in liability insurance. According to official estimates from both state and company officials, this amount did not even begin to cover the cost of damages. Furthermore, according to The Dallas Morning News, Texas law allows fertilizer storage facilities to operate without any liability insurance at all, even when they store hazardous materials.Swanson, Doug; Dunklin, Reese. West Fertilizer was insured for only $1 million, a fraction of estimated losses. The Dallas Morning News, May 4, 2013. Injuries and fatalities West Mayor Tommy Muska told the Waco Tribune-Herald that as of late evening, April 17, six or seven volunteer firefighters from the city were unaccounted for.West Mayor Tommy Muska: Six or seven firefighters were in the facility at the time of the explosion and not accounted for., Waco Tribune-Herald Twitter, April 17, 2013 West EMS Director Dr. George Smith, himself injured, said he believed at least two emergency responders were killed. \\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\\" Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman D.L. Wilson said at a midnight news conference on April 17. \\"We have a tremendous amount of injuries ... over 100 injuries at this time.\\" Wilson did not confirm or deny an earlier report that the number of deaths could be in the range of 60 to 70. He said the blast zone was \\"just like the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City,\\" comparing its effects to the Oklahoma City bombing, and that \\"50 to 75\\" homes and businesses were damaged. Sergeant William Patrick Swanton of the Waco Police Department said the operation has gone into a \\"search-and-rescue mode\\", aiming to find survivors and recover those who might be trapped in buildings. He said at least 160 people had been injured, and the firefighters who were combating the initial fire were still unaccounted for. Swanton quoted local environmental officials and emergency personnel in saying there was no risk to the community from the smoke fumes rising from the facility. Over 100 people were reported injured in the blast, and were originally transported to a makeshift triage set up at West High School's football field. It was later moved to a community center due to its proximity to the still-burning facility. Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco received over 40 injured for treatment. Patients were also admitted to Waco's Providence Healthcare Network, Fort Worth's John Peter Smith Health Network, Dallas's Parkland Memorial Hospital, and Temple's Scott and White Memorial Hospital. Authorities announced on April 19 that twelve bodies had been recovered, sixty people were missing, and at least 200 had been injured. The twelve dead included ten first responders as well as two civilians who had volunteered to fight the fire. The final confirmed death toll was fifteen fatalities, and approximately 160 to 200 people were injured. Reactions Seismograph reading from Hockley, Texas, south-east of West, clearly displaying the temblor caused by the explosion Those living in and around West report that the blast felt like an earthquake. The United States Geological Survey recorded the explosion as a 2.1-magnitude tremor. The blast was heard in nearby Hillsboro, Waxahachie, DeSoto, and as far north as Arlington. Windows were blown out in Abbott, NNE of West. Texas Governor Rick Perry issued a statement on the evening of April 17: President Barack Obama issued his own statement on April 18: Due to toxic fumes and a large number of displaced families, West Independent School District announced on its Twitter feed that all five of the district's schools would stay closed until further notice. They reopened on April 22. Nearby school districts Abbott Independent School District (ISD) and Penelope ISD also closed their schools for a day. Waco Police indicated that they would treat the explosion site as a crime scene out of caution. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced on the morning of April 18 that it would send a national response team‚Äîincluding fire investigators, explosive experts, chemists, and canine units‚Äîto investigate the site. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, an independent federal agency that investigates accidents involving industrial chemicals, also dispatched a major investigation team to West to begin searching for the cause of the disaster. Urban Search and Rescue Texas Task Force 1 and Texas Task Force 2 Urban Search and Rescue deployed on the morning of April 18 to assist in search and rescue. An incident management team from the Texas A&M; Forest Service was also deployed, as was the Veterinary Emergency Team from Texas A&M; College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences. Governor Perry declared McLennan County a disaster area, and on April 22, President Obama issued an Emergency Declaration, which afforded the state aid with 75% federal funding. On April 18, the Texas National Guard sent members of the 6th Civil Support Team to the area to test the air quality and assess chemical and biological hazards. On June 13, 2013, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declined additional aid to the town, based in large part on the ability of the State of Texas to provide the necessary funds to rebuild. However, on August 2, 2013, FEMA reversed its original decision and approved a major disaster declaration for West. Investigation The state fire marshal department said that investigators interviewed \\"almost 300 people,\\" and followed 160 leads in their initial investigation. In May 2013, the Texas Department of Public Safety instructed the Texas Rangers and the McLennan Sheriff's Department to join the Texas Fire Marshal's Office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, in the criminal investigation into the explosion. Investigators blamed stocks of ammonium nitrate fertilizer stored in a bin inside a seed and fertilizer building on the property for the explosion but failed to identify what started the actual fire that led to the explosion. On April 22, 2014, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board released preliminary results of its investigation into the explosion. It found that company officials failed to safely store the chemicals in its stockpile, and that federal, state and local regulations about the handling of hazardous materials were inadequate. In a statement released alongside the report, the board's chair, Dr. Rafael Moure- Eraso, stated: \\"The fire and explosion at West Fertilizer was preventable. It should never have occurred. It resulted from the failure of a company to take the necessary steps to avert a preventable fire and explosion and from the inability of federal, state and local regulatory agencies to identify a serious hazard and correct it.\\"Chemical Safety Board Ongoing Investigation Emphasizes Lack of Protection for Communities at Risk from Ammonium Nitrate Storage Facilities; Finds Lack of Regulation at All Levels of Government (press release), U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (April 22, 2014). The CSB's yearlong investigation found that 1,351 facilities across the country store ammonium nitrate, and that their many areas had no regulations to keep such facilities away from populated areas. Moure-Eraso urged new and revised regulations, stating \\"there is no substitute for an efficient regulatory system that ensures that all companies are operating to the same high standards. We cannot depend on voluntary compliance.\\"Terrence Henry, Investigation: Disaster at West Fertilizer Plant Was ‚ÄòPreventable\\" (NPR April 22, 2014). The ATF announced on May 11, 2016, that the fire that led to the explosion was intentionally set. However, they declined to comment about any possible suspects, though a reward of $50,000 for information leading to an arrest has been offered. This finding was subsequently disputed by various other experts, who noted that the ATF's finding was based primarily on their inability to find any other cause for the initial fire. Some people complained that it delayed victims' lawsuits against the fertilizer company, gave the defendants more legal ammunition, and prompted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to put a hold on new chemical plant safety rules.https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston- texas/houston/article/Experts-cast-doubt-on-ATF-s-arson-finding-in- West-11725989.php#photo-6158878 The Waco-McLennan County Public Health District in collaboration with the Texas Department of State Health Services carried out and completed an epidemiological study to describe the physical injuries related to the incident.

In 2015, the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 942 regulating storage and inspection of ammonium nitrate and granting authority to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local fire marshals to effect and enforce such regulation. Lawsuits At least seven lawsuits were filed against Adair Grain Inc., which owned the West Fertilizer Company facility. On October 11, 2015, a day before jury selection was to begin, parties reached a partial settlement in one case. Its terms have not been disclosed. The settlement includes the families of the three civilians killed in the fire and explosion. This is separate from the $118,300 in fines that West Fertilizer was handed for violating several rules about the handling of hazardous materials. A trial for a second group of plaintiffs was expected to begin in late 2016.Partial settlement reached in deadly Texas fertilizer plant explosion - Yahoo News In January 2018, it was reported that the city of West will receive $10.44 million in settlements with defendants in the litigation around the plant explosion, the West City Council approved the settlement, which includes funds for damages not covered by insurance or grants from state or federal agencies. The lawsuit that the settlement pertains to, was filed on behalf of the city and claimed the defendants were negligent in selling or distributing the ammonium nitrate based fertilizer, that they failed to properly warn of the dangers associated with the handling and storage of the product, and should have never sold the product to West Fertilizer.

The change can be either in the connection or wall between a thermodynamic system and its surroundings, or in the value of some variable in the surroundings that is in contact with a wall of the system that allows transfer of the extensive quantity belonging that variable.Tisza, L. (1966), pp. 41, 109, 121, originally published as 'The thermodynamics of phase equilibrium', Annals of Physics, 13: 1‚Äì92.Giles, R. (1964), p. 22.Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999).Callen, H.B.(1960/1985), p. 15. It is assumed in thermodynamics that the operation is conducted in ignorance of any pertinent microscopic information. A thermodynamic operation requires a contribution from an independent external agency, that does not come from the passive properties of the systems. Perhaps the first expression of the distinction between a thermodynamic operation and a thermodynamic process is in Kelvin's statement of the second law of thermodynamics: \\"It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the surrounding objects.\\" A sequence of events that occurred other than \\"by means of inanimate material agency\\" would entail an action by an animate agency, or at least an independent external agency. Such an agency could impose some thermodynamic operations. For example, those operations might create a heat pump, which of course would comply with the second law. A Maxwell's demon conducts an extremely idealized and naturally unrealizable kind of thermodynamic operation.Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 88, 100. An ordinary language expression for a thermodynamic operation is used by Edward A. Guggenheim: \\"tampering\\" with the bodies.Guggenheim, E.A. (1949). Distinction between thermodynamic operation and thermodynamic process A typical thermodynamic operation is externally imposed change of position of a piston, so as to alter the volume of the system of interest. Another thermodynamic operation is a removal of an initially separating wall, a manipulation that unites two systems into one undivided system. A typical thermodynamic process consists of a redistribution that spreads a conserved quantity between a system and its surroundings across a previously impermeable but newly semi-permeable wall between them.Tisza, L. (1966), p. 47. More generally, a process can be considered as a transfer of some quantity that is defined by a change of an extensive state variable of the system, corresponding to a conserved quantity, so that a transfer balance equation can be written.Gyarmati, I. (1970), p. 18. According to Uffink, \\"... thermodynamic processes only take place after an external intervention on the system (such as: removing a partition, establishing thermal contact with a heat bath, pushing a piston, etc.). They do not correspond to the autonomous behaviour of a free system.\\"Uffink, J. (2001). For example, for a closed system of interest, a change of internal energy (an extensive state variable of the system) can be occasioned by transfer of energy as heat. In thermodynamics, heat is not an extensive state variable of the system. The quantity of heat transferred, is however, defined by the amount of adiabatic work that would produce the same change of the internal energy as the heat transfer; energy transferred as heat is the conserved quantity. As a matter of history, the distinction, between a thermodynamic operation and a thermodynamic process, is not found in these terms in nineteenth century accounts. For example, Kelvin spoke of a \\"thermodynamic operation\\" when he meant what present-day terminology calls a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process.Kelvin, Lord (1857). Again, Planck usually spoke of a \\"process\\" when our present-day terminology would speak of a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process.Planck, M. (1887).Planck, M. (1897/1903), p. 104. Planck's \\"natural processes\\" contrasted with actions of Maxwell's demon Planck held that all \\"natural processes\\" (meaning, in present-day terminology, a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process) are irreversible and proceed in the sense of increase of entropy sum.Guggenheim, A.E. (1949/1967), p. 12. In these terms, it would be by thermodynamic operations that, if he could exist, Maxwell's demon would conduct unnatural affairs, which include transitions in the sense away from thermodynamic equilibrium. They are physically theoretically conceivable up to a point, but are not natural processes in Planck's sense. The reason is that ordinary thermodynamic operations are conducted in total ignorance of the very kinds of microscopic information that is essential to the efforts of Maxwell's demon. Examples of thermodynamic operations Thermodynamic cycle A thermodynamic cycle is constructed as a sequence of stages or steps. Each stage consists of a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process. For example, an initial thermodynamic operation of a cycle of a Carnot heat engine could be taken as the setting of the working body, at a known high temperature, into contact with a thermal reservoir at the same temperature (the hot reservoir), through a wall permeable only to heat, while it remains in mechanical contact with the work reservoir. This thermodynamic operation is followed by a thermodynamic process, in which the expansion of the working body is so slow as to be effectively reversible, while internal energy is transferred as heat from the hot reservoir to the working body and as work from the working body to the work reservoir. Theoretically, the process terminates eventually, and this ends the stage. The engine is then subject to another thermodynamic operation, and the cycle proceeds into another stage. The cycle completes when the thermodynamic variables (the thermodynamic state) of the working body return to their initial values. Virtual thermodynamic operations A refrigeration device passes a working substance through successive stages, overall constituting a cycle. This may be brought about not by moving or changing separating walls around an unmoving body of working substance, but rather by moving a body of working substance to bring about exposure to a cyclic succession of unmoving unchanging walls. The effect is virtually a cycle of thermodynamic operations. The kinetic energy of bulk motion of the working substance is not a significant feature of the device, and the working substance may be practically considered as nearly at rest. Composition of systems For many chains of reasoning in thermodynamics, it is convenient to think of the combination of two systems into one. It is imagined that the two systems, separated from their surroundings, are juxtaposed and (by a shift of viewpoint) regarded as constituting a new, composite system. The composite system is imagined amid its new overall surroundings. This sets up the possibility of interaction between the two subsystems and between the composite system and its overall surroundings, for example by allowing contact through a wall with a particular kind of permeability. This conceptual device was introduced into thermodynamics mainly in the work of Carath√©odory, and has been widely used since then.Tisza, L. (1966), pp. 41, 50, 121.Carath√©odory, C. (1909).Planck, M. (1935).Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 18. Additivity of extensive variables If the thermodynamic operation is entire removal of walls, then extensive state variables of the composed system are the respective sums of those of the component systems. This is called the additivity of extensive variables. Scaling of a system A thermodynamic system consisting of a single phase, in the absence of external forces, in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is homogeneous.Planck, M. (1897/1903), p. 3. This means that the material in any region of the system can be interchanged with the material of any congruent and parallel region of the system, and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged. The thermodynamic operation of scaling is the creation of a new homogeneous system whose size is a multiple of the old size, and whose intensive variables have the same values. Traditionally the size is stated by the mass of the system, but sometimes it is stated by the entropy, or by the volume.Landsberg, P.T. (1961), pp. 129‚Äì130.Tisza, L., (1966), p. 45.Haase, R. (1971), p. 3.Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), pp. 28‚Äì29. For a given such system , scaled by the real number to yield a new one , a state function, , such that , is said to be extensive. Such a function as is called a homogeneous function of degree 1. There are two different concepts mentioned here, sharing the same name: (a) the mathematical concept of degree-1 homogeneity in the scaling function; and (b) the physical concept of the spatial homogeneity of the system. It happens that the two agree here, but that is not because they are tautologous. It is a contingent fact of thermodynamics. Splitting and recomposition of systems If two systems, and , have identical intensive variables, a thermodynamic operation of wall removal can compose them into a single system, , with the same intensive variables. If, for example, their internal energies are in the ratio , then the composed system, , has internal energy in the ratio of to that of the system . By the inverse thermodynamic operation, the system can be split into two subsystems in the obvious way. As usual, these thermodynamic operations are conducted in total ignorance of the microscopic states of the systems. More particularly, it is characteristic of macroscopic thermodynamics that the probability vanishes, that the splitting operation occurs at an instant when system is in the kind of extreme transient microscopic state envisaged by the Poincar√© recurrence argument. Such splitting and recomposition is in accord with the above defined additivity of extensive variables. Statements of laws Thermodynamic operations appear in the statements of the laws of thermodynamics. For the zeroth law, one considers operations of thermally connecting and disconnecting systems. For the second law, some statements contemplate an operation of connecting two initially unconnected systems. For the third law, one statement is that no finite sequence of thermodynamic operations can bring a system to absolute zero temperature. References Bibliography for citations *Bailyn, M. (1994).

It aired on SBS from September 10, 2005 to July 2, 2006 on Saturdays and Sundays at 20:45 for 85 episodes. According to AGB Nielsen Media Research, it was the 5th highest rated TV program in Korea for the year 2006, with an average rating of 28.3%, and a peak rating of 44.5%. The popular soap opera invited both criticism and high ratings for its provocative plot. The story revolved around a middle-aged woman who introduces her handsome news anchor stepson to her abandoned daughter, who had led a miserable life because of a cruel stepmother. It triggered controversy when the woman was revealed as the girl's biological mother. Viewers were divided on whether it was \\"immoral\\" and \\"incestuous\\" or a fresh take on relationship dramas, but director Lee Young-hee insisted that the show's theme was \\"deep maternal love, with a mother reclaiming her own daughter as a daughter-in-law in order to atone for having abandoned her as a baby.\\" Plot When she was very young, Ji Young- sun (Han Hye-sook) gave away her baby Lee Ja-kyung after giving birth to her. She later remarries and creates a new family, but soon after, her husband dies, leaving her behind with her stepson Gu Wang-mo (Lee Tae-gon), and her daughter Gu Seul-ah (Lee Soo-kyung). Now grown and a makeup artist, Lee Ja- kyung (Yoon Jung-hee) finds herself adrift with loneliness since her foster parents died when she was a child. She fell in love with her step-uncle but his family shuns her, dashing away any hopes of being with him. Deciding to focus on her career and find a new love, she meets Wang-mo, a TV news anchor. Young-sun has been searching for the daughter whom she had abandoned in her youth. As if guided by the hand of fate, she discovers that Ja-kyung is already going out with Young-sun's own stepson, Wang-mo. In order to keep her secret daughter by her side, Young-sun does everything in her power to marry Ja-kyung to Wang-mo, and eventually succeeds.

In 2010, an analyst at the National Ports and Waterways Institute stated that nearly all global shipping lines were using slow steaming to save money on fuel. Rationale and history Slow steaming was adopted in 2007 in the face of rapidly rising fuel oil costs, which was 700 USD per tonne between July 2007 to July 2008. According to Maersk Line, who introduced the practice in 2009 to 2010, slow steaming is conducted at . Speeds of were used on Asia- Europe backhaul routes in 2010. Speeds under are called super slow steaming. Marine engine manufacturer W√§rtsil√§ calculates that fuel consumption can be reduced by 59% by reducing cargo ship speed from 27 knots to , at the cost of an additional week's sailing time on Asia-Europe routes. It adds a comparable 4 to 7 days to trans-Pacific voyages.Steamship Mutual report The container ship Emma Maersk can save 4,000 metric tons of fuel oil on a Europe-Singapore voyage by slow steaming. At a typical 2008 price of USD 600-700 per tonne, this works out to USD 2.4-2.8 million fuel savings on a typical one-way voyage. Maersk's Triple E class of ships was designed for slow steaming, with hulls optimized for lower speeds. Because of this, it has less powerful engines than its predecessors. Cost and benefits Lowering speed reduces fuel consumption because the force of drag imparted by a fluid increases quadratically with increase in speed. Thus traveling twice as fast requires four times as much energy and therefore fuel for a given distance. The power needed to overcome drag is the product of the force times speed and thus becomes the cube of the speed at high Reynolds numbers. This is why driving an automobile at requires less than 85% of the power required by the same automobile driving at .AnswersSlow steaming guide Although lowering speeds reduces the power requirements, the overall benefits of speed reduction may be limited by other factors, such as economically viable total voyage time, and the fact that a ship's engine and propeller are designed to operate within a certain RPM range. Steaming too slowly may place the engine and propeller outside their most efficient range, and will therefore begin to counteract the benefits.Note that if a variable pitch propeller is fitted, slow steaming may be accomplished effectively. Also, there are fixed costs, such as crew wages and charter rates, that will increase if the voyage is longer. Although some ships are being put into service that are designed to steam most efficiently at slower speeds, the great cost of building a ship and need to remain competitive means that radical changes are unlikely until conditions merit such a risk.The economics of slow steamingIs Slow Steaming Good for the Supply Chain? \\"Smart Steaming\\" The trade off between fuel cost savings against the increased costs of personnel, insurance and inventory due to the longer voyage duration is a significant logistical issue. Commercial vessels seek to adhere reliably to schedules; if a ship is planned to slow steam, it may normally speed up should it encounter en route delays (such as bad weather or deviation) so as to recover its original scheduled arrival time. The initiative to balance cost, duration, emissions and risk is supported by the EC-funded research project SYNCHRO-NET.https://www.mjc2.com/synchronet.htm - SYNCHRO-NET: Smart Steaming and Synchro-modal Logistics. \\"Smart steaming\\" is a strategy by which the vessel speed is dynamically optimised based on the real- time state of the sea, weather and the destination port - for example if there is congestion at the port there is little point in rushing to get there at full speed simply to then wait for a berth for days - instead the ship can go more slowly to conserve fuel and still berth at the same time. The International Maritime Organisation's GloMEEPhttps://glomeep.imo.org/ - GloMEEP - Just-in-time ship Operations. project has also studied this subject, and refers to \\"Just in time Ship Operations\\". Smart Steaming has the potential to deliver many benefits. For example the SYNCHRO-NET projecthttps://www.mjc2.com/synchro-net-smart-steaming-supply-chain.htm - Smart Steaming and De-stressing the Supply Chain. has reported examples of up to 30% reduction in fuel usage for the ship, which, broadly speaking, means a similar reduction in cost and greenhouse gas emissions. Technically and operationally smart steaming presents some challenges. Ship control systems have to be more sophisticated, and multi-objective optimization techniques are needed which can respond to changing conditions (e.g. weather, sea state, port status). Improvements in ship/port communications are also needed, as well as new commercial and legal agreements between relevant stakeholders: ship operator, ship owner, port/terminal operator and the customer/freight forwarder whose goods are being carried by the ship.

A sunken ship is in the foreground. HMS Vivacious (D36) was a V-class destroyer of the British Royal Navy that saw service in World War I and World War II. Construction and commissioning Vivacious, the first Royal Navy ship of the name, was ordered on 30 June 1916 as part of the 9th Order of the 1916‚Äì17 Naval Programme. She was laid down in July 1916 by Yarrow Shipbuilders of Glasgow, Scotland, and launched on 3 November 1917. She was completed in December 1917 and commissioned on 29 December 1917. Service history World War I and interwar years Upon completion, Vivacious was fitted for use as a minelayer and entered service with the fleet during the final year of World War I. After the war, she deployed to the Baltic Sea in 1919 to participate in the British campaign there against Bolshevik forces during the Russian Civil War, seeing action against Russian warships. She later served in the Atlantic Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet until decommissioned and placed in reserve at Rosyth Scotland, in the mid-1930s. In August 1939, Vivacious was recommissioned with a reserve crew for the review of the Reserve Fleet by King George VI at Weymouth. World War II =1939‚Äì1941= Vivacious remained in commission after the United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939, Assigned to the 17th Destroyer Flotilla at Plymouth for convoy escort and patrol duties in the English Channel and the Southwestern Approaches, she escorted an 18-ship convoy carrying supplies, ammunition, and vehicles for the British Expeditionary Force from the United Kingdom to Cherbourg, France, on 10 September 1939. From 15 to 16 December 1939 she provided escort for Convoy HG 10 during a portion of its passage from Gibraltar to Liverpool. On 12 April 1940, Vivacious and the destroyers and joined Convoy HG 25, bound from Gibraltar to Liverpool, to reinforce its escort, which had consisted only of the sloops and . After arriving at Liverpool on 15 April 1940, Vivacious remained based there. On 12 May 1940, as German forces conquered the Netherlands, Vivacious and the destroyer escorted the destroyer as Codrington transported the Dutch Royal Family from the Hook of Holland into exile in the United Kingdom in Operation J.Naval History: HMS VENETIA (D 53) ‚Äì V & W-class Destroyer On 26 May 1940, Vivacious was chosen to participate in Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk, France, and she departed Dover that day in company with the light cruiser and the destroyers , , , , , and . She began patrols the following day to protect the evacuation beachhead from attacks by German aircraft and motor torpedo boats (S-boats, known to the Allies as \\"E-boats\\"). She made two trips from Dunkirk to Dover on 28 May 1940, evacuating 326 men on the first one and 359 on the second, and on 30 May 1940 she carried 537 more men from Dunkirk to Dover. German howitzers ashore fired on her on 31 May 1940 while she was off Bray-Dunes, France, inflicting 15 casualties on her crew. She took 427 more men from Dunkirk to Dover on 1 June 1940. She also took part in Operation OK on 3 June 1940, in which blockships were sunk to block the harbor at Dunkirk; she took aboard the crews of the sunken ships and brought them to Dover. One of those rescued from Dunkirk was the Rev Ivan Neill who would later become the Chaplain General. After the evacuation was complete, Vivacious was transferred to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla at Sheerness on 7 June 1940 for convoy escort and anti-invasion patrol duty in the North Sea. While escorting Convoy FN 288 from Southend to Methil on 22 September 1940, a mine detonated near her, causing damage that was not fully repaired until mid-1941. In 1941, after the threat of invasion subsided, she began to participate in the interception of German S-boats in the North Sea to prevent them from attacking convoys in addition to her other duties. =The Channel Dash, 1942= Vivacious was on exercises with the destroyer leader and the destroyer of her own flotilla and the destroyer leader and destroyers and of the 16th Destroyer Flotilla on 12 February 1942 when Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine surprised the British by steaming the battleships and and the heavy cruiser at high speed from France to Germany via the English Channel, Strait of Dover, and North Sea in Operation Cerberus, which became known as the \\"Channel Dash\\". The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force had virtually no forces available to oppose them, so the Admiralty ordered the six destroyers to abort their exercises and make torpedo attacks against the German heavy ships. Vivacious was the first to attack and did not suffer any major damage or casualties despite the heavy escort and air cover the Germans had provided for the passage, but the attacks were unsuccessful and the German ships succeeded in making port in Germany. =1942‚Äì1945= After the Channel Dash, Vivacious returned to her normal North Sea duties. She was \\"adopted\\" by the civil community of Solihull, then in Warwickshire, in March 1942 in a Warship Week National Savings campaign, and she collided with the destroyer on 31 August 1942.HMS VESPER (D 55) ‚Äì V & W-class Destroyer In January 1943, she was chosen for detached duty with the Home Fleet to assist in the defense of Arctic convoys steaming to and from the Soviet Union.

In March 1943, she joined the escort destroyers and in providing similar escort services for Convoy RA 53. She returned to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla and her North Sea duties in April 1943. In May 1944, Vivacious was selected to form Escort Group 103 with Campbell, the corvettes and , and Motor Launches of the Coastal Forces to operate in Force L during Operation Neptune to provide escort for convoys bringing reinforcements and supplies to the beachhead in the days following the initial assault of the Allied invasion of Normandy. She began service with the escort group in early June 1944 in the Thames Estuary and commenced escort duty on 8 June 1944, two days after the initial landings, when the 103rd Escort Group, supplemented by the corvettes and , escorted Convoy ETM 3, consisting of 14 motor transport ships, from the Thames Estuary to The Solent. The following day, she took part in escorting Convoys ETM 33 and ETM 3W to the beachhead, then returned to the Nore. She continued convoy protection duties related to the invasion until released from Operation Neptune toward the end of June 1944. In July 1944, Vivacious returned to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla and convoy escort and patrol duties in the North Sea and English Channel, continuing them until the surrender of Germany in early May 1945. After that she operated in support of reoccupation forces and on 15 May 1945, joined the destroyer in escorting minesweepers during minesweeping operations at Bergen, Norway. Decommissioning and disposal Vivacious was decommissioned during the summer of 1945 ‚Äì she was no longer carried on the Royal Navys active list as of July 1945 ‚Äì and was in reserve until placed on the disposal list in 1947. She was sold on 17 May 1947 to BISCO for scrapping by Metal Industries and arrived at the shipbreakers yard on 10 September 1948.

History In 1982, Porkchop Cash joined Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association based in Memphis, Tennessee. Cash soon formed a tag team with Troy Graham (who wrestled as \\"Dream Machine\\") known as The Bruise Brothers. Wrestling as heels, they held the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship twice. The Bruise Brothers were in the First Family stable of Jimmy Hart. Their main rivals were The Sheepherders, as tag team from New Zealand. They beat Dutch Mantel and Koko B. Ware for their first title on October 3, 1983. They also had a series matches with The Rock 'n' Roll Express, trading the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship with them. A notable moment in the feud came after their match on November 7, 1983. Cash and Graham lost the match and the belts and responded by attacking the referee, Paul Morton (father of Ricky Morton of The Rock 'n' Roll Express). The Bruise Brothers avenged their loss one week later by regaining the championship. On November 29, 1983, The Bruise Brothers dropped the belts to The Fabulous Ones. Tension built within Hart's stable, and The Bruise Brothers faced stablemates The Grapplers (Len Denton and Tony Anthony) in a \\"losers no longer managed by Jimmy Hart\\" match on December 26. The Grapplers won, leaving Cash and Graham without a manager. Shortly thereafter, Cash replaced Graham with Mad Dog Boyd. Cash and Boyd initiated a feud with Eddie Gilbert by stealing a portrait of Gilbert that he had been showing off every week and offering to award to the winner of a draw.

A liberal associated with the political left, he was a scion of the conservative Imperiali family.Grassi Orsini (2004) His most important position was as the Italian ambassador in London during the First World War (1914‚Äì18). Family Born at Salerno, Imperiali was the second child and first son of the Marquis Francesco Imperiali (1826‚Äì1904), from a cadet branch of the Princes of Francavilla, and Clementina Volpicelli, daughter of Pietro Volpicelli, a businessman and landowner, and Teresa Micheroux, from a family of French soldiers established in Naples with King Charles III of Spain. Saint Caterina Volpicelli (1839‚Äì1894), a nun and foundress of the Congregation of the Handmaids of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, was his maternal aunt.Guglielmo Imperiali, Diario, 1915‚Äì1919, ed.

Early career Imperiali attended law school in Naples, graduating in 1880. He joined the foreign service in 1882, and was posted to the United States at the critical moment of the Italian lynchings in New Orleans, following the assassination of police chief David Hennessy in 1890.Marco Rimanelli, Sheryl Lynn Postman, The 1891 New Orleans Lynchings and U.S.-Italian Relations: A Look Back, New York: P. Lang 1992. In October 1895, just before a posting to Brussels, he married Giovanna Maria Colonna (1867-1946), daughter of Edoardo, Prince of Summonte, from a family influential in political and court circles. Between 1901 and 1903 he was in Berlin, serving as head of mission, where he tried to strengthen the Triple Alliance and criticised the German government for recognising the Treaty of Bardo, whereby France had gained control of Tunisia over Italy. After the fall of Foreign Minister Giulio Prinetti, Imperiali was sent to Sofia, capital of Bulgaria. The recent M√ºrzsteg Agreement (2 October 1903) between Austria- Hungary and Russia was designed to cut the Italians out of the Macedonian Question. Imperiali served very briefly in Belgrade at the beginning of 1904 before being sent as ambassador to Constantinople. He was moved from there to London, taking up residence in the latter in May 1910. There he had the task of defending the Italo-Turkish War, provoked by Italy, and furthering Italy's Balkan interests in the London Conference of 1912‚Äì1913. In December 1913 he was appointed a senator. First World War and post-war Although at the start of the World War he preferred neutrality, after Italy and the Triple Entente became allies he was the main Italian negotiator of the Treaty of London (1915) which promised Italy substantial territorial gains in case of victory against Germany and Austria. After the end of the war, he was a member of the Italian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and a co-signer of the Treaty of Versailles, although his role during this negotiations was less central. However, in November 1920, due to strong disagreements with the new Italian foreign minister, Count Carlo Sforza, Imperiali was removed from his post in London, replaced by Baron Giacomo de Martino and mostly excluded from post-war negotiations. In 1921, he was appointed Italian representative to the Council of the League of Nations and was also involved in humanitarian initiatives like the protection of deported women and children during the Greco-Turkish War. After the Fascists came to power in 1922, Imperiali left his position at the League of Nations in 1923, but began to attend the Senate more regularly, becoming a prominent member of the opposition and an authority in matter of foreign relations. In 1932, he was made a knight of the Order of the Annunciation, a rare honour for a diplomat. He died at Rome.

Among his more important works were the Coliban Water Supply for Bendigo, and Melbourne Port improvements. Early career Joseph Brady was born on 18 August 1828 near Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland. He worked on the English Tithe Commutation Survey in 1842-44 working with his father where he gained skills in field surveying and draftsmanship. He then became an assistant engineer to Charles B. Vignoles on railway surveys in Lincolnshire and Kent as well as working on the Skipton, Sedbergh and Lancaster railway. Migration to Australia Bradley migrated in 1850 aboard the Argyle to Sydney, Australia where he became a draftsman with the newly formed Sydney Railway Company, and then advanced to the position of assistant engineer on 24 July 1851, undertaking surveys and supervising construction for the company's Sydney and Parramatta Railway. He also took charge of surveys and construction of the Sydney - Mittagong line which served the newly opened iron ore mines. He acted as chief engineer, but shortly after a new chief was appointed in 1857, he resigned and returned to Victoria. Bendigo In Victoria, Brady became engineer with Edward N. Emmett's Bendigo Water Works Company, for whom he designed and constructed the original town reservoir and reticulation services between 1858 and 1863. After a break on railway projects he won the Victorian government prize of ¬£500 for the best scheme to supply water to the Bendigo and Mount Alexander goldfields. By 23 December 1858 he had completed surveys and drafted plans for eight reservoirs and a system of connecting aqueducts.Coliban Water, History \\"Water for Gold! - The fight to quench Central Victoria's Goldfields\\" Brady returned to the Bendigo waterworks in 1871 to construct an additional reservoir, settling ponds and extend reticulation. In 1873 country water supplies were taken over by the Victorian government Water Supply Department under chief engineer, George Gordon (engineer) who appointed Brady as engineer for the Bendigo district of the Goulburn River supply. Railway work followed for contractors Cornish & Bruce including the section of the Bendigo Railway between Woodend and Castlemaine, which had the heaviest earthworks on the line. In 1869-71 he moved to the first section of the north-eastern railway line from Melbourne to Seymour for O'Grady, Legatt & Noonan. This work included a large plate girder bridge over the Goulburn River. Queensland In between these posts, Brady traveled to Queensland to provide advice and designs for the navigational improvements on the Brisbane and Bremer Rivers between Brisbane and Ipswich in 1864 involving much submarine blasting. He took on a position as Engineer of Harbours and Rivers to the Brisbane Board of Water Works, on 21 January 1865, as well as working for the Enoggera Water Works, designing and constructing a reservoir, gravitational works and reticulation systems for the City of Brisbane in around 1865-1867. He produced reports on the Bremer River railway bridge, and on 3 August 1867 accepted a role to manage construction on the Western railway line from Brisbane to Dalby which continued to about 1869. His salary of ¬£600 and monthly bonus of ¬£25 were substantial for the time. Melbourne Harbour Trust When the Melbourne Harbour Trust was formed in 1877, Brady was one of the first applicants for the position of Chief Engineer. His previous success with railway and water projects appears to have impressed the commissioners, and so he won the position. While the Trust engaged Sir John Coode to provide advice and designs on the harbour improvements, Bradey was able to convince the scommissioners to accept his modification resulting in consuiderable efficiencies and cost savings. these involved using Australian hardwood timber piled wharfs instead of Coode's masonry, and excavating a single large basin for what became Victoria Dock rather than several small docks. As a result, Melbourne gained one of the largest single excavated dock basins in the World, which put the Harbour Trust in good stead for the next 80 years. Brady was in charge of works amounting to around ¬£3,500,000, only about half of which was part of Coode's plans. He resigned in 1891 and was awarded a hororarium of ¬£1500 for his service. He then continued as a private consultant and arbitrator on engineering disputes until his retirement in 1894. Professional roles Brady was elected associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, London, on 7 December 1875 and full member on 3 December 1878. Two of his papers: 'The Geelong and Sandhurst Water Supplies' (1878‚Äì79) and 'Early railway construction in New South Wales' (1904‚Äì05) were published in the institution's Proceedings. he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria in 1858-9, and its successor the Royal Society of Victoria from 1860. Personal life Painting of the 1851 Princes Bridge by Joseph Brady Brady married Adelaide Sarah Keck, (the daughter of Henry Keck, the governor of Darlinghurst gaol), at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, on 14 February 1854. they had seven surviving children. The eldest son, Lyndon Francis, moved to Western Australia where he was a pioneer of the timber business as manager with the Millar Karri and Jarrah Co. Georgina was the only daughter to marry, her husband, Edward Wardell, was master of the Melbourne Mint. Brady died on 8 July 1908 at his home, 'Allowah', in Staniland Grove, Elsternwick. Brady was also an artist, with a number of watercolours attributed to him including a fine rendering of the first Princes Bridge in Melbourne. Legacy The Powerhouse Museum in Sydney hold a shirt said to have belonged to Brady. In 1868, the mayor and citizens of Dalby presented Brady with a testimonial and an inscribed silver claret jug (now in the possession of a grandson in Adelaide). The Joseph Brady Memorial Public Lecture is held in his honour, organised by Engineers Australia. Joseph Brady Park, 240 Riverside Ave, Barellan Point Ipswich is named after him.EXPANDED IPSWICH HERITAGE STUDY References Sources * 'Obituary: Joseph Brady', Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers (London), vol 174, 1908, pp 374‚Äì76 * John Oxley Library, Manuscripts and Business Records Collection, State Library of Queensland * Joseph Brady - Records, 1864, OM67-23; John Oxley Library, Manuscripts and Business Records Collection, State Library of Queensland.

Florida (1963) (often referred to as the Pitts-Lee case) was a criminal case in which two African-American defendants were charged with murder. The case is remembered for its Civil Rights implications, and because it involved two death-row inmates who were later exonerated. The prosecutors deliberately tampered with evidence, and the men were sentenced to death by an all-white jury, Freddie Lee Pitts and Wilbert Lee (the defendants) were imprisoned for twelve years before being pardoned by then-Florida Governor Reubin Askew on September 20, 1975.  Background  The crime occurred on August 1, 1963 in Port St. Joe, Florida. On the night of the crime, Freddie Pitts (age 28), Wilbert Lee (20), and several other people went to a Mo-Jo gas station in the small town. Pitts and Lee went to use the restroom, but the restrooms in the facility were only for whites. This caused Pitts and Lee to get into an argument with the attendants, two white men named Grover Floyd Jr. and Jesse Burkett. Floyd and Burkett were found dead three days later. They had been shot to death. After being coerced by the police into making an accusation, a woman who was with Pitts and Lee accused Pitts and another man of the crime. This other suspect was a soldier who worked for the military, and they provided an alibi for him. The woman then changed her accusation, accusing Pitts and Lee of the crime. Pitts and Lee confessed to the crime after the police beat them and threatened to harm Lee's wife, among other examples of cruel treatment. Their lawyer, who had been appointed by the Court, advised them to plead guilty. The two men did not have a trial, as they had confessed to the crime and pleaded guilty. They were sentenced to death by an all-white jury on August 28, 1963. In 1966, a man named Curtis Adams confessed to the murders of Floyd and Burkett.  Appeals  Pitts and Lee spent over a decade appealing their case. In 1964 they appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, alleging that the judge in their case had made procedural errors. However, the Court ruled against them. They then filed a motion objecting to the composition of the jury that had sentenced them, and after the trial court ruled against them, they appealed to the Florida First District Court of Appeal. The Court upheld the lower court's ruling. Pitts and Lee filed another attack on their convictions in 1967. They argued several points. They objected to the fact that one lawyer had represented both of them, that people who opposed the death penalty had not been included on the jury, they argued that their guilty plea was based on coercion, that their lawyer had been inadequate, that the State had withheld evidence that supported their innocence, and that Curtis Adams had confessed to the crime. Not only had Adams confessed to the crime, but the woman who accused them was now saying that she had been coerced into fingering them. However, there was considerable resistance in the state to acknowledging these facts. When the Gulf County sheriff was told about Adams' confession, he said that \\"\`I got two niggers on Death Row who already did it.'\\" However, in Court the prosecutors refused to grant Adams immunity for his crime, so he pleaded the Fifth Amendment. While the Court had ample evidence that Adams had told other people about his guilt (including testimony from Adams' girlfriend), they could not use it because of Adams pleading the fifth. Warren Holmes, the man who had taken Adams' confession under a lie detector, mentioned the case to his friend Gene Miller. Holmes told Miller that he believed Pitts and Lee were innocent. Miller, a reporter for the Miami Herald, began to investigate the case. He wrote a book on his findings, Invitation to a Lynching, which argued that Pitts and Lee had been wrongfully convicted. In 1976, Miller would be awarded a Pulitzer Prize in Local General or Spot News Reporting for his work on \\"Invitation to a Lynching\\". This book convinced Florida Attorney General Robert Shevin to testify to the Florida Supreme Court that he believed the State had wrongfully withheld evidence, and that the two men were actually innocent. Shevin later admitted that this confession of error likely cost him his chances at being elected governor, \\"But it was right and I had to do it. Pitts and Lee then had an actual trial, but they were again declared guilty by an all-white jury. Neither Adams' confession nor the prosecution's earlier suppression of evidence were allowed to be presented to the jury. The US Supreme Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia caused their death penalty sentences to be commuted to life imprisonment. Pitts and Lee made an appeal to the US Supreme Court, but the Governor would pardon them before the Supreme Court decided whether to grant certiorari.  Pardon  Arthur Canaday, General Counsel to Governor Reubin Askew, read an early copy of Miller's Invitation to a Lynching. Canaday found the book persuasive and he told Askew that there was a real chance that the defendants were innocent. Askew launched an investigation into the case, and he too became convinced that Pitts and Lee were innocent. The Governor and three members of the cabinetIn Florida, it is not the Governor's Cabinet. The Cabinet consists of independently-elected statewide officers, and the Governor is not a member of the Cabinet. See Tom Raum, \\"Governor Askew Insists He's Not a Cabinet Member,\\" Tallahassee Democrat, July 8, 1971. Under the Florida Constitution at that time, no pardon was effective unless signed by the Governor and at least three members of the Cabinet. See Fla. Const. art. IV, s. 8 (as in effect at the time). (Attorney General Robert Shevin, (whom Canaday previously worked for), Treasurer Phil Ashler, and Education Commissioner Ralph Turlington), signed a pardon that freed Pitts and Lee after twelve years in prison.  Aftermath  After being pardoned, Lee worked for the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services as a juvenile counselor. However, Lee lost his job in 1985 after Florida passed a law banning former felons from working with children. Lee took legal action, and although a lower court ruled against him, the Florida 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled in his favor. The Court ruled that Askew's pardon made Lee free from any legal consequences of his conviction. Pitts and Lee would work for years to try to gain some sort of compensation for their wrongful imprisonment. A bill was introduced multiple times in the Florida Legislature to grant them money to attempt to make up for their imprisonment, but it failed nineteen times. The legislation was regularly defeated by a traditional Southern Democratic faction of conservative legislators from the Panhandle. In 1998, Kendrick Meek reintroduced the bill in the Florida House, and Betty Holzendorf reintroduced it in the Senate. Holzendorf and Meek, along with a faction of more liberal Democrats, forged an alliance with Florida Republicans over getting the bill passed. However, the House wanted to give the men substantially less money than the Senate did. The Florida House ended up passing a bill that would allow a hearing officer from the Florida Department of Administrative Hearings to grant the men a reward of up to $350,000. A committee in the Senate voted to directly give each man $1.5 million. The Senate and House were eventually able to reach a compromise. April 30, 1998, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles signed a bill into law that granted each man $500,000 as long as a state administrative judge concurred with the assertion that the state had wronged them.

The team was the first intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy. The team had no coach, as it was entirely student-operated; however, it was captained by squad member Bill Maxwell. The team played just a single game, which was a scoreless tie with the Baltimore Athletic Club. The team was entirely student operated, and was not supported by the Naval Academy's faculty. The school would not have another football squad until 1882. Background It is widely believed by football researchers that the playing of intercollegiate football began in November 1869, when a player at Rutgers University challenged another player at the nearby College of New Jersey (now Princeton). The contest more closely resembled soccer, with teams scoring by kicking a ball into the opponent's net, and lacked a uniform rules structure.PFRA Research, \\"No Christian End!\\", p. 2 The game developed slowly; the first rules were drafted in October 1873, and only consisted of twelve guidelines.PFRA Research, \\"No Christian End!\\", p. 3 Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased, the game was still effectively controlled by the College of New Jersey, who claimed eight national championships in ten years. Only Yale presented any form of challenge, claiming four national championships in the same time period. The birth of football at the Naval Academy is debated among historians. The most accepted occurrence was in 1869, when a midshipman (a student) returned from his leave with a football. While throwing the ball with a friend, it was dropped and a group of fellow midshipmen attempted to take it. A contest was eventually organized, which ended abruptly when the ball was kicked into the Severn River.Clary (1965), p. 8Schoor (1967), pp. 3‚Äì4 However, biographer C. Douglas Kroll stated that the first evidence of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward, a theory supported by journalist Jack Clary.Kroll (2002), p. 14Clary (1997), p. 9 Regardless, the sport had been banned for several years prior to 1879. Schedule Season summary There were two separate efforts to establish a Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment to help keep the school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy.Clary (1997), p. 10 A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.Clary (1965), p. 9 The year's sole contest was played on December 11 against the Baltimore Athletic Club. The opposition's team was reportedly composed of players from Princeton, Yale, Pennsylvania, and Johns Hopkins.Bealle (1951), p. 7 The Naval Academy hosted the Baltimore team on a temporary field drawn on part of the superintendent's cow pasture. Rules decided upon between the teams established that the game was to be played under rugby rules. The Baltimore American and Chronicle, which covered the contest, described it as such:Patterson (2000), p. 21 :The game, played under rugby rules, was a battle from beginning to enda regular knock down and drag out fight. Both sides became immediately excited and the audience was aroused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by the spirited contest. The ball oscillated backward and forward over the ground without any material result. :The scrimmages were something awful to witnessliving, kicking, scrambling masses of humanity surging to and fro, each individual after the leather oval. If a Baltimorean got the ball and started for a run, he was unfailingly caught by one of the brawny Cadets and dashed to earth with five or six men falling on him. The 1879 team introduced a white canvas jacket uniform (shown being tailored, c. 1892) which is believed to be the first in college football The game was closely fought and was finally declared a scoreless tie by the referee about an hour after it began. Navy reportedly never gained possession of the ball. However, the Naval Academy managed to keep the Baltimore Athletic Club from ever being in a scoring position. On three separate occasions, Navy forced Baltimore back into its own end zone for a safety; these were not worth any points until 1882, however, so they offered Navy no benefit. The American and Chronicle reported that Maxwell, Craven, and Sample of Navy gave the strongest performances, but were also reckless in their play and were repeatedly penalized for jumping offside or kicking the ball out of play, a form of delay of game.Clary (1997), p. 11 Some time after the game, Walter Camp, known as the \\"Father of American Football\\", credited Maxwell as the inventor of the first football uniform. After he was informed that the Baltimore team he was playing outweighed his by an average of ten pounds, Maxwell looked for a way to make the teams more evenly matched. Using his knowledge of sailing, he decided to design a sleeveless canvas jacket which would make his players \\"difficult to grasp when they began to sweat\\".Anderson (2004), \\"Chapter 10: The Game\\" He presented the design to the academy's tailor, who created the double-lined jackets which \\"were laced down the front and drawn tightly to fit snugly around a player's body\\". The weighted suits were worn by the team, which was confused by the \\"strangle, heavy, newfangled getups\\". Players The 1879 Naval Academy team was made up of fifteen players at four different positions. The squad consisted of ten forwards, two halfbacks, two wholebacks, and one three-quarterback.Bealle (1951), p. 8 Maxwell, in addition to playing as a rusher, served as team manager and captain. John F. Luby, a first-classman, served as an unofficial assistant coach.Bealle (1951), p. 15 Only first-classmen were asked to participate on the team. The age of the players, however, ranged several years due to the academy's admission policy; the school allowed for men between the ages of 14 and 18 to be admitted as first year students, which future player John B. Patton remarked made it \\"just a boys' school\\".Schoor (1967), p. 5 Rushers * Charles Cabaniss * MacDonough Craven * Miles Gorgas * Edward Leiper * Jim Mahoney * William \\"Bill\\" Maxwell (capt.) * T.A.

The Midshipmen would not participate in their first Rose Bowl until the 1923 season, when they went 5‚Äì1‚Äì2 and tied with the Washington Huskies 14‚Äì14 in the match. According to statistics compiled by the National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis, and the Billingsley college football research center, Yale was declared the 1882 season champion, giving them their eighth overall. The Naval Academy would not produce another football team until the 1882 season. The 1882 team would be the first with a coach, being supported by Academy officials. The 1879 season was the last time that a Navy squad would play the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14‚Äì12‚Äì2, with one of those ties being the game against the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would outscore their opponents 292‚Äì231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54‚Äì19‚Äì3. The lack of a coach for the 1879 season was one of the two times the Naval Academy squad lacked one, the other time being from 1883 through 1891.

The episode was written by Gene Hong, and directed by Tristram Shapeero. The episode features the study group as puppets and several original musical numbers. Jason Alexander guest-stars as a mountain man. Sara Bareilles also guest-stars as a hot air balloon ride operator. Plot The study group sit in silence after revealing secrets to each other when lost in the woods following a balloon ride. Dean Pelton, who dresses up as Pinocchio, helps the group communicate with each other through the use of hand puppets. The flashback shows that the group, bothered that they may be in a rut, decide to go on a hot air balloon ride. As they sing their way into the balloon, Pierce severs a rope and unmoors the basket, setting it off on an untethered course without its operator (Sara Bareilles). Battling through storm and high winds they eventually crash, although Jeff helps to soften the landing by increasing the flame, and land the balloon in the middle of the woods. There, they meet a mountain man (Jason Alexander) who feeds them berries. The berries cause a hallucinogenic reaction in all of the study group members. As they sit by a fire, the group reveal personal secrets. Back in the study room Shirley recounts the time when she thought she saw her husband Andre with another woman at a supermarket and followed him for hours, only to find out it wasn't him. Meanwhile, she had left her children overnight back at the store. When the other members of the group tell her that it's the first time they've heard of this story they realize the berries also caused them to not clearly remember details of the night. The group relaxes in the knowledge that their secrets are still secret, but Shirley feels ashamed at being the worst mother in the world for leaving her kids. Jeff asks the group to reshare their secrets while sober in order to not leave Shirley the odd-one-out. Jeff dated a woman who was perfect for him, but left without notice after promising to attend her son's baseball game, reflecting the actions of Jeff's own father. Britta touts herself as a politically-involved activist, but has actually never voted except for The Voice. Annie let Prof. Cornwallis rub her feet in exchange for answers to a history test she was struggling with. Troy burnt an anthill causing the Greendale Fire of 2003, affecting 55 acres. Pierce confesses to never actually having sex with Eartha Kitt, only dry humping inside her tour bus. Abed has nothing to confess as he has held no secrets from the group, and he only acted awkward because he wanted to fit in. The group leave, now happier, as Dean Pelton laments being left behind after cleaning up the mess. He sees Jeff's puppet doing a bicep curl and consoling him, telling him \\"who says you have to be alone?\\" Production The episode was written by co-producer Gene Hong, his first writing credit for the series. It was directed by executive producer Tristram Shapeero, who directs the majority of the season 4 episodes. This was the last episode filmed of season four with Chevy Chase, who does not appear onscreen, only providing the voice of Pierce's puppet. The episode features an original song co-written by Adam Levine. The premiere airing did not use the original end tag (since they were shown the previous week as a teaser); instead, a collection of outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage set to music was used. Most of the footage can be found in several extras on the DVD, but not in the same format or in its entirety. Reception The episode was seen by approximately 2.84 million viewers when it premiered, and increased 22% in viewership from the previous episode.

Swedish Finnish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld with the SS Vega to Stockholm on 24 April 1880. SS Vega, used during the expedition of the Finnish-Swedish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld. SS Vega at anchor in the Penkigney Bay of the Bering Sea. SS Vega frozen into packed ice outside Piltekai, Siberia. Photo by Louis Palander The Vega Expedition () of 1878‚Äì1880, named after the and under the leadership of Swedish Finnish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld, was the first Arctic expedition to navigate through the Northeast Passage, the sea route between Europe and Asia through the Arctic Ocean, and the first voyage to circumnavigate Eurasia. Initially a troubled enterprise, the successful expedition is considered to be among the highest achievements in the history of Swedish science. Preparations Nordenski√∂ld had already conducted a series of expeditions in the Arctic, including to Svalbard, West Greenland, the Kara Sea and the Yenisei River. In 1877, Nordenski√∂ld began planning the expedition to find the Northeast Passage, and in July he presented a detailed plan to King Oscar II, who accepted the proposal. Additional funds were provided by members of the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography and the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg, and private individuals, notably Swedish industrialist and philanthropist Oscar Dickson (1823-1897) and Russian industrialist Alexander Sibiryakov (1849‚Äì1933). The steamship Vega, constructed in 1872 at Bremerhaven as a sealer and whaler, was bought for the expedition, and was converted at the Karlskrona naval shipyards in Blekinge, Sweden, with government funding. Sibiryakov also equipped another steamship, Lena, which would accompany the expedition until the Lena River in Siberia. Expedition members Louis Palander (1842‚Äì1920) was appointed captain of the expedition. Palander was a Swedish naval officer and an experienced sailor who had already made several trips in the Arctic and had previously participated in other Nordenski√∂ld expeditions. It also included scientists, officers and a crew of 21 men. Noted members of the international team included: * Ernst Almquist, Swedish doctor, botanist and lichenologist * Karl Johan Andersson, Swedish xylographer and painter * Giacomo Bove, Italian sailing master, in charge of the Marine chronometers, made astronomical observations needed to fix the ship's position * Andreas Peter Hovgaard, Danish naval officer, explorer and meteorologist, responsible for the meteorological and magnetic observations * Frans Reinhold Kjellman, Swedish botanist * Oscar Frithiof Nordquist, Finnish hydrographer and zoologist, acted as the Russian interpreter * Anton Stuxberg, Swedish zoologist  The expedition Vega left Karlskrona on June 22, 1878, made a stop in Tromso from July 17 until July 21. In Tromso, Vega was joined by the cargo ship Lena, commanded by Edvard Holm Johanssen. The ships reached Cape Chelyuskin, the northernmost tip of the Eurasian continent, on August 19, 1878. Lena navigated up the Lena river towards Yakutsk on August 27, with Vega continuing east along the coast, which had only a narrow ice-free strip a couple of miles wide. Vega's progress stopped in pack ice on September 28, 1878, about 1.5 kilometers from the coast at the Chukchi Peninsula at Neshkan, only days from the Bering Strait. The expedition spent the winter there. Vega could be freed from the ice only the next summer, on August 18, 1879, and it reached Bering Strait on August 20. Vega stopped in Japan for repairs for almost two months, and returned to Sweden through the Indian Ocean and the Suez canal. It returned to Stockholm on April 24, 1880.

It was designed and built by Mowry Baden and his son, Colin, in 1993. The installation is a representation of the structure used to perform the motorcycle and miniature automobile stunt, the wall of death. It includes the cylinder itself on the south side of the Burke- Gilman Trail, as well as a concrete ramp to the north of the trail, which includes a \\"series of stylized metal chairs mounted to the existing concrete bridge columns\\" and serves as the stands from which the stunts were viewed. The ramp provided a spot for skateboarders to ride, but after seven complaints and a head-on collision between a skateboarder and a cyclist in 2008, The Seattle Department of Transportation installed a rock barrier to deter skateboarders from interacting with the art. Although Mowry Baden had intended the installation to be used by skateboarders, he agreed that public safety was more important and met with the city in December 2008, to discuss updating it. Twenty-five concrete parking stops were then added to the sculpture, making it impossible to skate on. Reception The location was said by Seattle Weekly to tie with the Fremont Troll for the worst site for public art in Seattle. Citizens have called the piece \\"sinister, whimsical, and tacky\\".

Pre-Birimian migmatites, gneisses, and amphibolites, located under the Birimian rocks, are the oldest rocks in the country. The Birimian deposits in the southwestern part of the country are typically divided between clastic and volcano-clastic formations. Economic geology Gold is the most important geological commodity for Burkina Faso's economy, and makes Burkina Faso the eighth largest producer in Africa. Gold extraction increased 250% in 2008. It is produced from the Kalsaka, Mana and Youga mines, among others. Gold is found in the Birimian formations as a result of mineralization, and is also found in river gravels. Other metals mined include manganese, copper, zinc and silver whilst exploration continues for copper and uranium. Limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice and salt are also worked commercially. Alluvial diamonds have been found too. Other than gold, the most significant mineral extraction is of zinc at the Perkoa mine, and manganese at the Tambao mine. Low grade copper deposits have been found in three locations, but none of them are currently being mined. Burkina Faso does not extract any significant amount of petroleum and therefore relies on exports. There is also about 30 Mt of phosphate deposits believed to be in the Pendjari series.

Santana attributed his heavy drug use to trauma experienced during his childhood, claiming he had posttraumatic stress disorder and turned to drugs as a coping mechanism. Santana was hospitalised in March 2017 after suffering a seizure, which he blamed on a heavy workload and his poor sleep schedule. After the seizures persisted, Santana was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy in May 2017 and prescribed Keppra to treat it. Despite the medicine, Santana continued to suffer from seizures, usually multiple seizures in a row. Santana was hospitalized once again in October 2017 after friend and fellow rapper Gino Marley found Santana mid seizure on the floor of his house with blood coming from his mouth. Santana was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with both liver and kidney failure, with the main factors being his addiction to Xanax and lean. Santana expressed interest in going to rehab while in hospital.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on October 13, 2009. The episode is written by David North and Jesse Stern and directed by Leslie Libman, and was seen live by 21.04 million viewers. \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\" is part of a major story arc surrounding Ziva's captivity and torture in Somalia, her rescue, and its aftermath. Described as a \\"companion piece\\" to the season premiere, \\"Truth or Consequences\\", it reveals the events leading up to her being taken hostage by an Islamic terrorist through a series of flashbacks. The storyline serves as a catalyst for Ziva's choice to resign from Mossad in favor of becoming a full-time NCIS agent, culminating in the events of this episode.  Plot  When Ziva's application to become an NCIS agent is denied, Director Vance informs her that, as a result of the discovery of AWOL marine Daniel Cryer's (Erik Palladino) remains off the coast of Tanzania, her account of Mossad's operation to take down Saleem Ulman has been called into question. Cryer supposedly deserted the Marines to become a soldier of fortune and was part of the team that Mossad had sent after Saleem. Ziva is reluctant to discuss the events surrounding her captivity, which become dubious when the Navy salvages Damocles and discovers that the entire crew has been shot dead. Vance immediately takes Ziva into interrogation and presses her for answers. She protests that there are details she cannot divulge but begins to recount the operation: Cryer, under the name Shalev, negotiated a deal between the Mossad team and a Jordanian captain (Joseph Kamal), allowing the team passage to Somalia and discretion. Ziva later develops a friendship with Cryer. Vance continues to pressure her for more details, but her team leader, Malachi Ben- Gidon (TJ Ramini), appears at NCIS demanding that Ziva return to Mossad's control. Vance agrees on the condition that Malachi debriefs them on the rest of the mission. Malachi relents, telling them that their cover had been blown and they were forced to kill everyone on the ship, with Ziva killing Cryer. Aware that this would permanently bar Ziva from becoming an NCIS agent, Ducky talks privately to her. He urges her to tell him what happened, and she relents: a shot had been fired, erupting chaos on the ship and leading to the shootout. Though she had participated in the violence in self-defense, she had attempted to save Cryer by negotiating a truce when he assured her that he did not betray them. Gibbs, DiNozzo, and Abby, meanwhile, deduce that Malachi is lying; the shooter missed twice at short range before hitting Cryer, illogical for Ziva. Malachi, by contrast, is suffering from an injury to his shoulder sustained in the fight. Port of Mogadishu, Somalia, where Ziva and Malachi arrived after the shootout on the Damocles They forge a fake bullet while Ziva is brought back into interrogation. Gibbs confronts Malachi and forces him to face Ziva, who still cannot defend herself beyond denying the accusations. Gibbs informs Malachi that he is aware that the latter is actually responsible for Cryer's death, and it is confirmed through a flashback. He then throws Malachi out of the room, saying Ziva is \\"off limits\\". Ziva, in turn, realizes that her former team leader is acting under orders from her father, who opposes her leaving Mossad. Gibbs encourages Ziva to disclose what happened afterwards, and she reveals that she had gone to Saleem's camp alone to protect the surviving team members, who were both injured. She briefly describes the circumstances of her capture and admits that she did not intend to live through the ordeal. Gibbs gets up, whispers in her ear, and kisses her forehead, causing her to break down in relief. As the episode ends, Vance approves Ziva's application which results in Ziva becoming an NCIS Special Agent albeit a Probie.  Production  \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\" is written by David North and Jesse Stern and directed by Leslie Libman. Flashbacks that are interspersed throughout the episode are set in various locations, including Jordan, the Red Sea, and Somalia. On October 13, 2009, then-executive producer Shane Brennan discussed the episode's purpose: \\"We're filling in the blanks. In the audience's mind, we're filling in how she ended up being captured by Saleem, and the audience gets taken on a ride back to her time on the ship. It's a companion piece to the season opener.\\" He added, \\"It's done in such a way that the audience will be kept guessing as to what happened. It's a very clever, engaging, not-to-be-missed episode...Certainly this episode will help resolve some ‚Äî I won't say all, but some ‚Äî of the questions that have been left hanging over the last couple of episodes. Those questions are in the process of being answered, and what you'll have over the next couple of episodes is a resolution of the issues that they've grappled with in the very recent past.\\" Cote de Pablo discussed the development of her character as well as the storyline's impact: Mark Harmon, who portrays Gibbs, added, \\"She's back‚Äîphysically back‚Äîthough there‚Äôs quite a ways to travel yet. She's been through a lot, and her loyalty was really being called to the mat here. It doesn't surprise me at all that what [the writers] were doing with Gibbs is making him the last to the table. He perhaps cares the most. This is someone you either trust with your life or you don't, and it's that cut and dried for him. He's a huge fan of hers, but there was no loyalty question with anybody else on his team. What they do and how they trust each other is the most important part of the job.\\" Both Harmon and de Pablo noted that Gibbs had developed into a father figure for Ziva, a fact that complicated Gibbs' struggle with the issue of her trustworthiness. This episode was dedicated to the memory of Robert James \\"Bob\\" Bryan, an agent with the real-life NCIS, who died at age 50 on September 21, 2009 from complications of pneumonia. He served twenty years as an NCIS agent before retiring. In addition, Bryan provided firearms training to the main cast members of the NCIS show.http://archive.kitsapsun.com/lifestyle/celebrations/robert-james- bryan-50-ep-420434170-357915861.html  Reception   Ratings  \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\" was seen live by 21.04 million viewers in the United States, making NCIS the most watched television program on October 14, 2009. It had a 4.5 share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, with a share meaning the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. The episode attracted 2.473 million viewers in Canada and 1.84 million in Australia.  Critical reviews  \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\" received generally positive reviews. Allison Waldman of AOL TV praised several elements, saying, \\"First of all, let's get this out of the way quickly. This might be the best episode of the season. It was all character with just enough action to keep those who love gunfire happy. But most importantly, it cemented Ziva's place in the world of NCIS (the show and the organization). For that reason alone, this was four stars all the way.\\" She went on to analyze the characters' behaviors: \\"Ziva has been carrying around the guilt of what happened on the Damocles for weeks. And there was the guilt related to her being captured by Saleem when she was supposed to assassinate him...Alone with Ziva, Gibbs wasn't [good cop or bad cop]. He was Gibbs. Gibbs the mentor, the commanding officer, the surrogate father...He kissed her on the head, like a father. That was when Ziva cried...and smiled.\\" Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV opinionated, \\"While the episode featured Gibbs and Vance heavily, it was probably Ducky who did the most significant progress on Ziva.\\" Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic wrote, \\"For the past two episodes NCIS, while always superb, has felt like it's delaying the inevitable. Ziva was there, yet only in body, not in spirit. Her mind was somewhere else...The 20,000-ton elephant in the room ‚Äì the cargo ship that brought Ziva to (and went down off) the Horn of Africa, was recovered, as was a dead marine who was on board.\\" As a result of Eli David's conscious decision to have his daughter set up as a scapegoat for the marine's death, many viewers began to see his treatment of Ziva as abusive and manipulative. This was amplified by apparent inaction during Ziva's captivity and torture; though she was assumed dead, it became a common opinion that Eli had left her to die in the desert. The image of Gibbs as a surrogate father figure to Ziva subsequently became widely accepted among viewers. Viewers speculated about what Gibbs had whispered to Ziva in the final interrogation scene. In response, Harmon said that he had improvised the scene and that, \\"It's very specific, what was said. And the reaction and the read on Ziva from what is said is specific as well. Now, what I said or what Cote reacted to or how she found what she found for that, she's not gonna tell you any more than I am‚ÄîI don't think. That‚Äôs our secret. And yet it's all about respecting the work and knowing each other well enough to really say, 'Okay, I'll go there with you.'\\"  References  Category:2009 American television episodes Category:NCIS (season 7) episodes ","title":"Good Cop, Bad Cop (NCIS)"},{"id":"39145239","text":"Regarded as the most famous in Spain during Holy Week processions, the Virgin of Hope of Macarena, shown in her sorrowful theme while wearing imperial regalia each Friday before Palm Sunday. The Virgin of Charity, a Marian title of the Blessed Virgin Mary celebrated in Cartagena, Spain during the Friday of Sorrows. The Friday of Sorrows is a solemn pious remembrance of the sorrowful Blessed Virgin Mary on the Friday before Palm Sunday held in the fifth week of Lent (formerly called \\"Passion Week\\"). In the Anglican-Catholic Divine Worship: The Missal it is called Saint Mary in Passiontide and sometimes it is traditionally known as Our Lady in Passiontide. In certain Catholic countries, especially in Mexico, Guatemala, Italy, Peru, Brazil, Spain, Malta, Nicaragua and the Philippines, it is the beginning of the Holy Week celebrations and termed as Viernes de Dolores (Friday of Sorrows). It takes place exactly one week before Good Friday, and concentrates on the emotional pain that the Passion of Jesus Christ caused to his mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is venerated under the title Our Lady of Sorrows. In certain Spanish-speaking countries, the day is also referred to as Council Friday, because of the choice of as the Gospel passage read in the Tridentine Mass on that day (which is now read in slightly expanded form on Saturday of the fifth week of Lent), which recounts the conciliar meeting of the Sanhedrin priests to discuss what to do with Jesus. Like all Fridays in Lent, this Friday is a day of abstinence from meat, unless the national episcopal conference has indicated alternative forms of penance. A similar commemoration in sympathy with the Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Solitude is held on Black Saturday. History In the Philippines, a famed colonial image of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga is another manifestation of the Sorrowful Virgin celebrated by devout Filipino Catholics. In the Roman Catholic Church, the practice of religious veneration towards the Blessed Virgin Mary was designated on any given Friday, which was initiated by the Friday before Holy Week as well as Good Friday itself, after Palm Sunday. In 1727, Pope Benedict XIII extended a feast commemorating the sorrowful Virgin Mary to the whole of the Latin Church, assigning to its celebration the Friday in Passion Week, one week before Good Friday. In 1954, the feast still held the rank of major double (slightly lower than the rank of the 15 September feast) in the General Roman Calendar. Pope John XXIII's 1960 Code of Rubrics reduced it to the level of a commemoration. In 1969 the celebration was removed from the General Roman Calendar as a duplicate of the feast on 15 September.Calendarium Romanum (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1969). p.119 Each of the two celebrations had been called a feast of \\"The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\" (Latin: Septem Dolorum Beatae Mariae Virginis) and included recitation of the Stabat Mater as a sequence. Since then, the 15 September feast that combines and continues both is known as the Feast of \\"Our Lady of Sorrows\\" (Latin: Beatae Mariae Virginis Perdolentis), and recitation of the Stabat Mater is optional. Observance of the calendar as it stood in 1962 is still permitted in the Traditional Roman Rite, and even where the calendar as revised in 1969 is in use, some countries, such as Malta, have kept it in their national calendars. In every country, the 2002 edition of the Roman Missal provides an alternative collect for this Friday:Roman Missal, Friday of the Fifth Week of Lent > O God, who in this season give your Church the grace to imitate devoutly the > Blessed Virgin Mary in contemplating the Passion of Christ, grant, we pray, > through her intercession, that we may cling more firmly each day to your > Only Begotten Son and come at last to the fullness of his grace. In the last edition of the Tridentine Mass, published under John XXIII in 1962, the Collect was as follows: In 2015 Divine Worship: The Missal for Anglican use Catholics restored the observance on the Friday in Passion Week, and provided propers including the Introit Stabant iuxta crucem (Jn 19:25; Ps 56:1), and a modified form of the 1962 Collect > O LORD in whose Passion, according to the prophecy of Simeon, the sword of > sorrow did pierce the most loving soul of thy glorious Virgin Mother Mary: > mercifully grant that we, who devoutly call to mind the suffering whereby > she was pierced, may, by the glorious merits and prayers of all the Saints > who have stood beneath the Cross, obtain with gladness the benefits of thy > Passion; who livest and reignest with the Father, in the unity of the Holy > Spirit, ever one God, world without end. Amen. It also restored the Gradual Dolorosa et lacrimabilis, the Tract Stabat sancta Maria (Cf. Lam 1:12), the Sequence Stabat Mater dolorosa, the Offertory Recordare, Virgo Mater (Cf. Jer 18:20), the Communion Felices sensus beatae Mariae and the other requisite proper prayers. Celebration of Friday of Sorrows in Malta, Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru, Guatemala and the Philippines includes processions, public penance, mournful singing and the mortification of the flesh. In Mexico and Nicaragua, the faithful make small shrines of the Virgen de Dolores and decorate them with Christmas lights and perform street plays. In Guatemala, the people make oversized flowerbeds on the road where the religious float will pass while being incensed by the crowd. In the Philippines, candle-lit religious floats carry a statue of Our Lady of Sorrows in procession through the streets. This is followed by the recitation of the life of Christ using the pious Filipino book Pasiong Mahal, a localised version of the Passion of Christ. In some regions, penitents whip themselves in the streets. In Malta, beginning on this day, penitents place multiple chains on their feet and walk barefoot on the public streets hiding their identity via a conical hat. In Spain, the Catholic faithful shout ejaculatory praises to the float of the Sorrowful Virgin passing by, often accompanied by an exclamatory response Viva!. The floats are also preceded by a military parade and a musical band. In Italy, the practice is called La Festa dell'Addolorata and uses famous Baroque images made in the area of Naples. In Portugal, one of the best-known celebrations is the procession of the Seven Sorrows of Our Lady, in Mafra. Commonly held rituals are religious parades or processions, accompanied by the local singing of Stabat Mater and candle-light vigils.

Charles Schumer (D-NY) in the United States Senate and co-sponsored by the other seven members of the \\"Gang of Eight\\", a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators who wrote and negotiated the bill. It was introduced into the Senate of the 113th United States Congress on April 16, 2013. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the bill in April 2013. The bill was voted out of Committee on May 21, 2013 and was placed on the Senate calendar. On June 27, 2013, the Senate passed the bill on 68-32 margin. The bill was not considered by United States House of Representatives and died in the 113th Congress. If enacted, the bill would have made it possible for many undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and eventually citizenship. It would have increased border security by adding up to 40,000 border patrol agents. It also would have advanced talent- based immigration through a points-based immigration system. New visas had been proposed in this legislation, including a visa for entrepreneurs and a W visa for lower skilled workers. It also proposed new restrictions on H1B visa program to prevent its abuse and additional visas/green-cards for students with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees from U.S. institutions. The bill also included a $1.5 billion youth jobs program and repealed the Diversity Visa Lottery in favor of prospective legal immigrants who are already in the United States. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated this reform bill would have reduced the U.S. fiscal deficit by US$197 billion over the next ten years and by $700 billion by 2033. Its report also states that, if the bill had been passed, U.S. wages would have been 0.1 percent lower in 2023 and 0.5 percent higher in 2033 than under current law. The Social Security Administration said that it would help add $276 billion in revenue over the next 10 years while costing only $33 billion. Introduction The legislation would make deep and broad changes to existing U.S. immigration law. S.744 would create a program to help the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States gain legal status in conjunction with efforts to secure the border. It would also make changes to the existing system of legal immigration, attempting to make the system more responsive to economic needs. Other provisions would include the more extensive use of E-Verify by businesses in order to ensure that their workers have the legal right to work in the United States. This system has been criticized by some privacy advocates and groups concerned about the false positives generated by the system that prevent U.S. citizens from working. Additionally, on June 24, 2013, the Senate passed an amendment by 68-32 to this bill which would enhance border security by adding high-tech surveillance equipment and doubling the number of border agents to about 40,000 The bill has also passed the Senate by 68-32. Conservative Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives were opposed to this bill. House Republicans and Speaker Boehner said that this bill would not be introduced on the House floor, a tactic which was called anti-democratic by some as it prohibits U.S. House members from conducting a debate and a poll on this bill due to a so- called Hastert Rule. If U.S. House Speaker does not allow the bill to be introduced in the House, it still has a chance to be introduced on the House floor through a discharge petition. A discharge petition signed by 218 members (or more) from any party is the only way to force consideration of a bill that does not have the support of the Speaker. However, discharge petitions are rarely successful. Some have commented that this bill may be considered amnesty. This bill proposes earned legalization for illegal immigrants (they have to wait for 13 years, pay all back taxes, learn English, no legalization for people with criminal records, and citizenship or permanent residence only after the border becomes fully secure). Former House Speaker Boehner has said that the House Republicans favor a piece-meal approach, i.e., several different bills instead of one comprehensive reform bill. Instead of putting the existing Senate bill up for vote and making necessary modifications, he says that the House plans to draft another bill of its own without any path to citizenship and without some other changes (such as introducing a visa for entrepreneurs and delimiting the use of H1B visas to prevent their abuse) that the Senate bill offers. Senator Chuck Schumer has commented that the strategy of passing smaller-scale bills would not work and that Democrats would not support an enforcement bill without the promise of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush called on the GOP-led House to pass a comprehensive immigration bill and asked his party to quit being \\"the obstacle\\" on the divisive issue. Salient features Most of the debate is focused on illegal immigrants but there is only a small part of the bill that deals with this issue (path to legalization). The rest of the bill focuses on: * Adopting a points-based immigration system, like UK and Canada. This will allow acceptance of immigrants according to a merit-based system based on professional skills, family relations, and work history in the U.S. * Stronger border security and law enforcement. * Removal of per country green card quota limits, which would help in reducing the long backlogs. The wait time is in decades for some countries and many high-skilled immigrants (including U.S. educated immigrants), thus, tend to go back to their home countries due to the lack of a timely process. * Creating a new INVEST visa which would allow prospective foreign entrepreneurs to stay in the US and start companies easily (under current law, it is extremely difficult to do so). Data suggests that companies owned by immigrants are likely to hire more employees than native-born-owned companies. * Up to 25,000 more visas/green- cards to be allotted to foreign students who have earned a master's degree or above in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM). Research has shown that, on average, every 100 foreign students who remain in the United States after receiving a degree in science, technology, engineering or math (a so- called STEM degree) create 262 additional jobs in US. * Creation of W visa to allow low-skilled temporary workers. * The bill would replace the H-2A visa program for agricultural workers with a new ‚Äúblue card‚Äù for immigrants. * Increasing the number of H1B visas and imposing restrictions on the companies who misuse this program. * Allowing immigrants illegally brought to the U.S. as children to apply for registered provisional status, and to adjust that status to legal permanent residency after five years, faster than other illegal immigrants. * Transferring the quota of green cards now assigned to the Diversity Visa Lottery program to immigrants with advanced skills. Under the current DV lottery rules, lottery winners who have a high school diploma or \\"[t]wo years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation requiring at least two years' training or experience\\" are eligible for consideration. * Creating a program to provide jobs to low-income and minimally-skilled American youth. Overview The bill would provide illegal immigrants in the U.S. a pathway to citizenship for those who have resided in the U.S. before December 31, 2011. Illegal immigrants would initially need to apply for a newly created Registered Provisional Immigrant status; in order to do so immigrants would have to pay a fine and fees, any back taxes owed, pass a background check and not have a disqualifying criminal record. The bill also benefits children of illegal immigrants & agricultural workers with the inclusion of the DREAM Act & AgJOBS Act. Immigrants who receive the Registered Provisional Immigrant status will be able to apply for legal permanent resident status (Green Card) as long as strict Border Security provisions are met, including: increasing the number of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents and officers; construction of a double layer fence along certain parts of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border;and meeting a target of stopping 90% of illegal immigration border crossings. The bill would also drastically alter the methods of visa allocation under current family-based and employment-based categories, as well as introduce a new concept of a \\"merit-based\\" visa, which awards visas based on points accrued based on educational achievements, employment history, and other contributions to society. (Need to highlight: border security and enforcement, + pathway to citizenship/Registered Provisional Immigrants, + changes to legal immigration) Congressional findings This information is largely based on the list of congressional \\"findings\\" located in Section 2 (beginning on page 7) of . Also at . In many pieces of legislation, the bill opens with a section called \\"Congressional Findings\\", which are not details of the law, but rather information about the situation or general background that Congress wishes to provide to explain why the rest of the bill is necessary. In this case, Congress makes four statements of principles or aspirations explaining the need for immigration reform. Congress makes the following findings: :(1) The passage of this Act recognizes that the primary tenets of its success depend on securing the sovereignty of the United States of America and establishing a coherent and just system for integrating those who seek to join American society. :(2) We have a right, and duty, to maintain and secure our borders, and to keep our country safe and prosperous. As a nation founded, built and sustained by immigrants we also have a responsibility to harness the power of that tradition in a balanced way that secures a more prosperous future for America. :(3) We have always welcomed newcomers to the United States and will continue to do so. But in order to qualify for the honor and privilege of eventual citizenship, our laws must be followed. The world depends on America to be strong -- economically, militarily and ethically. The establishment of a stable, just and efficient immigration system only supports those goals. As a nation, we have the right and responsibility to make our borders safe, to establish clear and just rules for seeking citizenship, to control the flow of legal immigration, and to eliminate illegal immigration, which in some cases has become a threat to our national security. :(4) All parts of this Act are premised on the right and need of the United States to achieve these goals, and to protect its borders and maintain its sovereignty. Legislative history Senate The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act was created by a group of eight United States Senators - composed of four Republicans and four Democrats \\\\- nicknamed the \\"Gang of Eight:\\" Michael Bennet (D-CO), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John McCain (R-AZ), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chuck Schumer (D-NY). S. 744 was introduced into the Senate by Senator Schumer on April 16, 2013, with the other seven members of the Gang of Eight serving as co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, which held hearings and markups about the bill. The Judiciary Committee held hearings about the bill on April 19, April 22, and April 23, 2013. On May 9, May 14, May 16, and May 20, 2013, the committee held consideration and mark up sessions. On May 21, the committee ordered the bill to be reported, with amendments, favorably. Several other committees also held hearings about the bill. The United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held hearings on May 7. The United States Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship held hearings about the bill on May 16 and May 22. On June 7, 2013, Senator Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, filed report 113-40 to accompany S. 744. The report included the views of the majority of the committee in favor of the bill, as well as minority views and opinions. The 187-page report includes information about why the new immigration legislation is needed, the history of the bill's consideration by the committee, a section by section summary of the bill, a copy of the Congressional Budget Office's report on the bill, some conclusions, and the minority views on the bill. On June 11, 2013, the Senate voted 84-15 (all 52 Democrats, both Independents, and 30 Republicans voting in the affirmative) to proceed with debate. The Senate considered the bill on the floor on June 12‚Äì13, June 17‚Äì21, June 24‚Äì26, 2013. During this time, it was recommitted to the Senate Judiciary committee twice to make amendments. On June 27, 2013, the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 68-32 (all 52 Democrats, both Independents, and 14 Republicans voted in favor of the bill.) Roll call vote 168 Developments after Senate passage of June, 2013 The House of Representatives has not acted on this Senate bill.Keeling, Drew (2014), \\"Immigration Reform Issues Since 2013,\\" Migration as a travel business A statement of principles on immigration, released by Congressional Republicans on January 30, 2014, stated that ‚Äúwe will not go to a conference with the Senate‚Äôs immigration bill‚Äù and that ‚Äúborder security and interior enforcement must come first.‚Äù In the absence of a ‚Äúcomprehensive fix‚Äù from Congress, U.S. President Barack Obama announced on November 20, 2014 executive actions to ‚Äúmake our immigration system more fair and more just.‚Äù These actions included a long-contemplated program of \\"deferred action\\" which would allow an estimated 45% of unauthorized immigrants to legally stay and work in the United States.Keeling, Drew (2014), \\"Immigration Reform in Congress 2013-14,\\" These executive actions are being challenged by lawsuits filed by individual states. Provisions Title I - Border Security Title I, which begins on page 33, covers changes being made to border security in the United States. Some of the goals mentioned below are also addressed in the preceding sector One of the major provisions of S. 744 is a focus on increased border security, primarily dealt with in Title I. The bill establishes a goal of achieving a 90% success rate (Section 3(a)(3)) of intercepting and deporting illegal immigrants who attempt to cross the border in one of the \\"High Risk Border Sectors\\" - places where more than 30,000 people cross per year (Section 3(a)(5)). In order to accomplish this, the bill would increase the number of CBP officers by 3,500 people by 2017, authorize the National Guard to participate in missions related to border security, fund additional surveillance and surveillance technology, and provide funding to build a border fence. After the enactment of the bill (should it be enacted), the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has 180 days to write and submit two reports. First, the \\"Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy\\", which is a strategy meant to explain their plans for achieving and maintaining effective control in all high risk border sectors along the Southern border (established in Section 5(a)). The \\"Southern Border\\" refers to the international border between the United States and Mexico. The report will be submitted to several committees in Congress for review. Section 5(a)(2) explains the elements that should be included in the report, namely criteria for measuring success, capabilities that need to be obtained for the success of the strategy (equipment, personnel, etc.), and the infrastructure and technology required.pg 19-20 Congress grants the Department of Homeland Security $3,000,000,000 in order to pursue this strategy (Section 6(a)(3)(A)(i)). The second report that the DHS is required to write and submit in 180 days is the \\"Southern Border Fencing Strategy\\" to identify where fencing, including double-layer fencing, infrastructure, and technology should be deployed along the Southern border (Section 5(b)). Congress grants the Department of Homeland Security $1,500,000,000 in order to pursue this strategy (Section 6(a)(3)(A)(iii)). The bill would focus on three particular high risk sectors - the Tucson sector in Arizona and the Rio Grande and Laredo sectors in Texas. Title I focuses on preventing additional illegal immigration into the United States. Title I includes a number of provisions which are explained more explicitly in the bill's text. This is a short list of some of them: * Definitions: \\"Rural, high-trafficked areas\\" are rural areas through which drugs and illegal aliens are routinely smuggled, as designated by the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The \\"Southwest border region\\" is the area in the United States that is within 100 miles of the Southern border. * Additional U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are added - 3,500 additional federal law enforcement officers to be trained by 2017 * Authorization for the National Guard to be deployed to the Southwest border for the following purposes: :(1) to construct fencing, including double-layer and triple-layer fencing; :(2) to increase ground-based mobile surveillance systems; :(3) to deploy additional unarmed, unmanned aerial systems and manned aircraft sufficient to maintain continuous surveillance of the Southern Border; :(4) to deploy and provide capability for radio communications interoperability between U.S. Customs and Border Protection and State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies; :(5) to construct checkpoints along the Southern border to bridge the gap to long-term permanent checkpoints; and :(6) to provide assistance to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, particularly in rural, high-trafficked areas, as designated by the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. * Authorizes and funds border crossing prosecutions and related court costs in the Tucson Sector at a level sufficient to increase the average number of prosecutions from 70 a day to 210 a day ($50 million from the $3 billion Border Security Fund). It also provides increased funding for Operation Stonegarden to assist state and local law enforcement to help prevent illegal activity along the border. * Provides additional funding for additional border patrol stations and forward operating bases to interdict individuals entering the United States unlawfully immediately after such individuals cross the Southern border and to provide full operational support in rural, high-trafficked areas. * Provides funding for vital radio communications and interoperability between CBP -Office of Border Patrol and state, local, and tribal law enforcement to assist in apprehension efforts along the border. =Border Security= The bill contains many border security measures, some of which must be implemented before illegal immigrants can adjust from the provisional status to full green card status. However, the DHS Secretary simply must submit a plan for border security within the first six months of the bill in order to initiate the provisional legal status for illegal immigrants.Matt Canham, \\"Senate panel rejects Mike Lee‚Äôs border security plan,\\" Salt Lake Tribune, May 9, 2013. http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/56287505-90/bill-border-committee- enforcement.html.csp Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) explained that whether or not the border is secure will have no impact on the advancement of the legalization of illegal immigrants, saying, \\"We're not using border security as an excuse or a block to the path to citizenship. [The Gang of Eight] wants to make sure the border is secure, but not to use it as a barrier to prevent the 11 million from eventually gaining a path to citizenship\\" Jordan Fabian, \\"Chuck Schumer: Border Security Won't 'Block' Path to Citizenship,\\" ABC News, Jan. 31, 2013. abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Politics/democrat-chuck-schumer- border-security-meant-block-path/story?id=18368056 The bill provides resources for additional CBP officers, improvements in the border security infrastructure, and increasing the number of immigration prosecutions. It also provides resources for and requires additional training for CBP officers. The bill sets a goal of achieving a 90% success rate (Section 3(a)(3)) of intercepting and deporting illegal immigrants who attempt to cross the border in one of the \\"High Risk Border Sectors\\" - places where more than 30,000 people cross per year (Section 3(a)(5)). In order to accomplish this, the bill would increase the number of border security personnel by 3,500 people by 2017, authorize the National Guard to participate in missions related to border security, fund additional surveillance and surveillance technology, and provide funding to build a border fence. If the bill is enacted, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has 180 days to write and submit two reports. First, the \\"Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy\\", which is a strategy meant to explain their plans for achieving and maintaining effective control in all high risk border sectors along the international border between the United States and Mexico. Congress grants the Department of Homeland Security $3,000,000,000 in order to pursue this strategy (Section 6(a)(3)(A)(i)). The second report that the DHS is required to write and submit in 180 days is the \\"Southern Border Fencing Strategy\\" to identify where fencing, including double-layer fencing, infrastructure, and technology should be deployed along the Southern border (Section 5(b)). Congress grants the Department of Homeland Security $1,500,000,000 in order to pursue this strategy (Section 6(a)(3)(A)(iii)). Title II - Immigrant Visas Subtitle A--Registration and Adjustment of Registered Provisional Immigrants The focus of Subtitle A is changing the status of illegal immigrants already present in the United States. The section creates the category of \\"registered provisional immigrant\\" (RPI) and outlines the steps necessary to obtain this status, as well as what qualities or characteristics of an illegal immigrant will prohibit them from obtaining it. Immigrants must apply to have their status changed. In order to be eligible, they must have started residing in the United States prior to December 31, 2011 and have been physically present since then. They must then pay a $500 penalty fee, are assessed taxes, and must pay application fees to cover the cost of their application. Illegal immigrants are ineligible to change their status if they: * were convicted of an aggravated felony * were convicted of a felony * were convicted of three or more misdemeanors * were convicted of an offense under foreign law * voted unlawfully * or are judged to be inadmissible for criminal, national security, public health, or other morality grounds. Additional provisions: * Spouses and children of people in RPI status can be petitioned for as derivatives of the principal applicant (but must be in the United States at the time). * Immigrants in RPI status can work for any employer and travel outside of the United States * Individuals outside of the United States who were previously here before December 31, 2011 and were deported for non-criminal reasons can apply to re-enter the United States in RPI status if they are the spouse, of or parent of a child who is, United States citizen or lawful permanent resident; or are a childhood arrival who is eligible for the DREAM Act. * The application period will be for one year with the possibility of extension by the Secretary for an additional year. * Individuals with removal orders will be permitted to apply as will aliens in removal proceedings. * RPI status shall last for a six-year term that is renewable if the immigrant does not commit any acts that would render the alien deportable. Another $500 penalty fee is applicable at this time. * The Secretary may collect a processing fee from individuals who register for RPI status in an amount that is sufficient to recover all of the costs of implementing the registration program. * An individual who has been granted RPI status is not eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit (as such term is defined in section 403 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ()). * An individual who adjusts from registered provisional immigrant status to lawful permanent residence shall be deemed, as of the date of such adjustment, to have completed the five-year period specified in and . * A noncitizen granted registered provisional immigrant status under this section shall be considered lawfully present in the United States for all purposes, while such noncitizen remains in such status, except that the noncitizen ::is not entitled to the premium tax credit authorized under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and ::shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in section 1402(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (). * After 10 years, aliens in RPI status may adjust to Lawful Permanent Resident Status through the same Merit Based System everyone else must use to earn a green card (described below) if the following things have occurred: **The alien maintained continuous physical presence **They paid all taxes owed during the period that they are in status as an RPI **They worked in the United States regularly; **And demonstrated knowledge of Civics and English **All people waiting for family and employment green cards as of the date of enactment have had their priority date become current. **A $1,000 penalty fee is rendered Section 2103, the DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act of 2013) focuses on adjusting the immigration status of illegal immigrants who entered the United States as minor children. The Department of Homeland Security can change the immigration status of immigrants who arrived in the United States before turning 16, have been registered provisional immigrants for at least five years, and has earned an education in the United States (by graduating high school, getting a GED, attending 2 or more years of college education at a bachelor's degree level or higher) or spend four or more years in the Uniformed Services (with an honorable discharge). DREAM Act kids can get their green cards in five years and will be eligible for citizenship immediately after that. Section 2104 - Additional requirements creates rules about how the data immigrants submit as part of their application can be used, limiting it to immigration related purposes. It also establishes some procedures for reviewing immigration status decisions and challenging them in court. Section 2105 - Criminal penalty describes the penalties (a fine of up to $10,000) to anyone who deliberately misuses immigration data by using it, publishing it, or permitting it to be examined. =Registration and adjustment of registered provisional immigrants= Title II of S. 744 focuses on three things: (1) creating the registered provisional immigrant (RPI) status, which illegal immigrants in the United States are eligible to apply for, (2) creating an Agricultural Workers Program, and (3) changing the existing rules governing the legal immigration process. This includes changing the requirements for family-based immigration, economic-based immigration, and merit-based immigration. The bill creates a new immigration status, entitled Registered Provisional Immigrant status. Illegal immigrants who get adjusted under the bill would not be legal permanent residents yet, but they would be in a legal status and would no longer be considered to be present illegally. They would also be permitted to work lawfully. In order to receive this status, illegal immigrants would need to apply (which would have the effect of registering them with the U.S. government, hence the title of the status), pay both a fine and a fee, pay any owed back taxes to the IRS, learn English, and not have any disqualifying criminal history. Initially the status would be good for 6 years, with the possibility of having it extended for an additional 4 years. After a total of 10 years, then registered provisional immigrant would then have the opportunity to apply for legal permanent resident status, so long as the other triggers in the bill had taken place. The triggers in the bill that would need to occur before registered provision immigrants could proceed to legal permanent resident status and ultimately to citizenship are related to 1) border security: there are several in this area but the key one requires that 90% of those attempting to cross the southwest border illegally be stopped; and 2) visa backlog reduction: other areas of the bill create changes in the visa allocation system intended to eliminate the visa backlog, and this must happen before adjustments from registered provision immigrant to legal permanent resident. This is the \\"back of the line\\" provision; the idea is that illegal immigrants who gain status from this bill should not be able to become legal permanent residents sooner than someone who had legally filed a visa petition earlier and had been waiting for the approved visa to become available. Title II - Immigrant Visas cotd. Subtitle B--Agricultural Worker Program Chapter 1--Program for Earned Status Adjustment of Agricultural Workers :subchapter a--blue card status :subchapter b--correction of social security records Chapter 2--Nonimmigrant Agricultural Visa Program Chapter 3-- Other Provisions =Agricultural Worker Program= Another key part of the bill is the agricultural worker program. The program consists of two subprograms, a so-called \\"Blue Card\\" status and a nonimmigrant agricultural visa program, or guest worker program. =Blue Card Status= The Blue Card program is a temporary legal status (similar to the Registered Provisional Immigrant status) that will be available to illegal immigrants who can demonstrate that they have been in the United States performing qualifying agricultural work for a certain amount of time. Workers who obtain this status will have the opportunity later to adjust to legal permanent resident status if they meet certain conditions. Title II - Immigrant Visas Subtitle C-- Future Immigration This section begins on page 256. Subtitle C focuses on reforming current legal immigration law. This includes provisions about family members of U.S. citizens immigrating into the country, merit-based systems of immigration, and immigration related to work visas. =Future immigration= The bill makes many changes to current immigration system designed to control future flows of immigration. These include repeal of the diversity visa program, changes in several family-based visa classifications (e.g. elimination of sibling petitions for U.S. citizens and conversion of a petition by a legal permanent resident for a spouse or child to an immediate relative petition rather than a preference petition), and the ability to adjust future levels of worker visas (both those created by this bill and under current programs) based on economic conditions. The bill also creates \\"merit-based\\" visas, which immigrants will eventually be able to apply for on the basis of a point system which awards points for various criteria, including educational achievement, involvement in society, entrepreneurship, and other factors. The combined effects of the changes are intended to be greater control over future amounts of immigration and also the type of immigrant; the changes also reduce the share of family-based visa overall in favor of a greater number of employment-based and merit-based visas. Title II - Immigrant Visas Changes to family-based immigration: ** There are four preference categories (1, 2A, 2B, 3, and 4) based on family relationships and a minimum of 226,000 and up to 480,000 visas are allocated to these family preferences (in practice, it has always been 226,000 per year for the last decade). Under the new system there will be two family preference categories and they will cover unmarried adult children; married adult children who file before age 31, and unmarried adult children of lawful permanent residents (the current 1, age-restricted 3, and 2B preferences respectively, with 2A being made unrestricted). The bill would expand the current V visa to include those with family relationships. ** The bill repeals the availability of immigrant visas for siblings of U.S. citizens (the fourth preference) once 18 months have elapsed since the date of enactment. This preference has 2,473,114 backlogged applications as of the end of FY2012,Immigrant Visa Waiting List as of the End of Fiscal Year 2012 and a wait time of 12 years (considerably longer for Mexico and the Philippines).Visa Bulletin for July 2013 ** The bill amends the definition of ‚Äúimmediate relative,‚Äù which provides for unlimited access to visas and includes spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens, to include a child or spouse of an alien admitted for lawful permanent residence (the current 2A preference), and the child or spouse of an alien who is accompanying or following to join the child, parent or spouse of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. The 2A preference has the lowest demand and shortest waiting time, but also a relatively large allocation of visas which could be used to help clear the backlogs in the other preferences. ** The bill amends the existing category for married sons and daughters of citizens of the United States (the third preference) to bar anyone from entering who is over 30 years of age. This preference has 830,906 backlogged applications as of the end of FY2012, and a wait time of 10.5 years (considerably longer for Mexico and the Philippines). ** The bill repeals the Diversity Visa Program. Aliens who were or are selected for diversity immigrant visas for fiscal years 2013 or 2014 will be eligible to receive them. See Section 2303 - Repeal of the diversity visa program. Changes to employment-based immigration: ** On the employment green card categories, the bill exempts the following categories from the annual numerical limits on employment-based immigrants: derivative beneficiaries of employment-based immigrants; aliens of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics; outstanding professors and researchers; multinational executives and managers; doctoral degree holders; physicians with completed foreign residency requirements; graduate degree (conferred by U.S. universities) holders in STEM field with US employment; and physicians who have completed the foreign residency requirements or have received a waiver. ** The bill then allocates 40 percent of the worldwide level of employment- based visas to members of the professions holding advanced degrees or their equivalent whose services are sought in the sciences, arts, professions, or business by an employer in the United States (including certain aliens with foreign medical degrees). ** The bill increases the percentage of employment visas for skilled workers, professionals, and other professionals to 40 percent, maintains the percentage of employment visas for certain special immigrants to 10 percent and maintains visas for those who foster employment creation to 10 percent. ** The bill creates a startup visa for foreign entrepreneurs who seek to emigrate to the United States to startup their own companies. Merit-based visa system: ** The merit-based visa system is described in Section 2301 - Merit-based points track one and Section 2302 - Merit-based track two. The merit based visa, created in the fifth year after enactment, awards points to individuals based on their education, employment, length of residence in the US and other considerations. Those individuals with the most points earn the visas. Those who access the merit based pathway to earn their visa are expected to be talented individuals, individuals in our worker programs and individuals with family here. 120,000 visas will be available per year based on merit. The number would increase by 5% per year if demand exceeds supply in any year where unemployment is under 8.5%. There will be a maximum cap of 250,000 visas. ** Under one component of this merit based system the Secretary will allocate merit-based immigrant visas beginning on October 1, 2014 for employment-based visas that have been pending for three years, family-based petitions that were filed prior to enactment and have been pending for five years, long-term alien workers and other merit based immigrant workers. Title III - Interior Enforcement Title III of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act contains the following subtitles: * Subtitle A--Employment Verification System * Subtitle B--Protecting United States Workers * Subtitle C--Other Provisions * Subtitle D--Asylum and Refugee Provisions * Subtitle E--Shortage of Immigration Court Resources for Removal Proceedings * Subtitle F--Prevention of Trafficking in Persons and Abuses Involving Workers Recruited Abroad * Subtitle G--Interior Enforcement ** Section 3713 repeals (the Renunciation Act of 1944) =Interior enforcement= The bill contains provisions for enhancing interior enforcement of immigration laws, including requiring the implementation of E-Verify for verification of the status of employees and increased protections of U.S. workers. Title IV - Reforms to Nonimmigrant Visa Programs Title IV of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act contains the following subtitles: * Subtitle A-- Employment-based Nonimmigrant Visas * Subtitle B--H-1B Visa Fraud and Abuse Protections ** Chapter 1--H-1B Employer Application Requirements ** Chapter 2-- Investigation and Disposition of Complaints Against H-1B Employers ** Chapter 3--Other Protections * Subtitle C--L Visa Fraud and Abuse Protections * Subtitle D--Other Nonimmigrant Visas * Subtitle E--JOLT Act (the Jobs Originated through Launching Travel Act of 2013) * Subtitle F--Reforms to the H-2B Visa Program * Subtitle G--W Nonimmigrant Visas * Subtitle H--Investing in New Venture, Entrepreneurial Startups, and Technologies =Nonimmigrant Agricultural Visa Program= This program will be the new agricultural guest worker program, and will replace the current H-2A program which will be repealed by the bill. This program increases the number of workers available, and makes several key changes, such as allowing \\"permanent\\" guest workers (in the sense that the nonimmigrant agricultural visa would be portable from employer to employer as seasons change, rather than requiring a new visa for each season as the current H-2A program does) rather than only seasonal workers as the current H-2A program does. The bill also increases worker protections and raises minimum wages for agricultural workers. Farm owners and farm workers have generally joined together in support of these provisions of the bill. =Reforms to Nonimmigrant Visa Programs= The bill makes numerous reforms to nonimmigrant visa programs, including the H-1B, L, student visa, visitor visa, and H-2B programs. The reforms are designed to in some cases make the programs easier to use, and also to enhance the systems used to monitor compliance by nonimmigrant visa holders with the visa requirements. The annual cap on H-1B visas is increased substantially (from 85,000 to 205,000), but additional recruiting requirements are added that require positions first be posted on a government website for 30 days and offered first to qualified U.S. workers. The Department of Labor is given greater authority to review and challenge hiring decisions. Technology firms are lobbying against these provisions of the bill, arguing that it creates unwarranted governmental intrusion into internal hiring decisions and hampers the companies' ability to attract the most qualified employees from abroad. Senator Hatch of Utah has introduced an amendment that would remove these requirements. Specific programs =E-Verify= E-Verify is an \\"Internet-based system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States.\\" The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act would require all employers to use the E-Verify system, phasing employers in based on company size over five years. The E-Verify system would also be enhanced by various changes specified in the law. One of those changes is the development of a photo matching system. All people (U.S. citizens included) will be required to show their employers a photo ID, such as a driver's license, passport, or (in the case of legal immigrants) their \\"biometric work authorization card\\" or \\"biometric green card.\\" Their potential employer is required to look up the potential employee in the E-Verify database and compare the two pictures. Provisions are also made so that employees can \\"lock\\" their Social Security numbers in order to prevent other people from illegally using their same number somewhere else. The United States Customs and Immigration Services will have access to this system in order to track Social Security numbers with suspicious usage and attempt to catch the perpetrators. =Temporary visas= =INVEST visa= Title IV, Subtitle H of the bill creates the INVEST visa (Investing in New Venture, Entrepreneurial Startups, and Technologies) for immigrant entrepreneurs. This new visa program would allow immigrant entrepreneurs to come to the United States, start businesses, and create jobs in America. There would be two types of INVEST visas. A nonimmigrant INVEST visa would be renewable provided certain initial investment, annual revenue, and job creation criteria are met within an initial three-year period. The immigrant version of the INVEST visa would have basically the same criteria just at higher thresholds. Criticism Criticism of E-Verify The E-Verify system, which employers would all be required to use if this bill becomes law, is a controversial provision of the bill. The changes made would require that all employees receive a positive \\"yes\\" from the government that they are permitted to work in the United States. This provision has been severely criticized by organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union for changing the nature of the relationship between people and the government by creating a society based on receiving permission. In announcing their white paper on the subject, the ACLU wrote \\"In an attempt to stop the tiny percentage of those starting jobs in the United States each year who are unauthorized workers, E-Verify would force everyone to obtain affirmative permission from government bureaucracies before engaging in the core life functions of working and earning a living.\\" Concerns about E-Verify have also included the potential for abuses and hacking of the databases used by the program, issues related to errors that wrongly keep roughly 400,000 people a year from being hired, and objections to the program as bringing the United States closer to having a national ID card. Fiscal impact A Heritage Foundation study found that the bill would result in a net cost of $6.3 trillion. The study's methodology and findings were sharply criticized across the political spectrum. Tim Kane, a scholar formerly with the Heritage Foundation, said that \\"[the] pileup of outlandish Heritage estimates presents a credibility hurdle.\\" A report by the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office found that, instead, the bill would save $175 billion over the next ten years.

The position behind the crack tip at which the distance is measured is arbitrary but commonly used is the point where two 45¬∞ lines, starting at the crack tip, intersect the crack faces. The parameter is used in fracture mechanics to characterize the loading on a crack and can be related to other crack tip loading parameters such as the stress intensity factor K and the elastic- plastic J-integral. For plane stress conditions, the CTOD can be written as: \\\\delta_\\\\text{t} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{8\\\\sigma_\\\\text{ys}a}{\\\\pi E}\\\\right)\\\\ln\\\\left[\\\\sec\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi \\\\sigma^\\\\infty}{2\\\\sigma_\\\\text{ys}}\\\\right)\\\\right] where \\\\sigma_\\\\text{ys} is the yield stress, a is the crack length, E is the Young's modulus , and \\\\sigma^\\\\infty is the remote applied stress. Under fatigue loading, the range of movement of the crack tip during a loading cycle \\\\Delta\\\\delta_\\\\text{t} can be used for determining the rate of fatigue growth using a crack growth equation. The crack extension for a cycle da/dN, is typically of the order of \\\\Delta\\\\delta_\\\\text{t}.  History  Examination of fractured test specimens led to the observation that the crack faces had moved apart prior to fracture, due to the blunting of an initially sharp crack by plastic deformation. The degree of crack blunting increased in proportion to the toughness of the material. This observation led to considering the opening at the crack tip as a measure of fracture toughness. The COD was originally independently proposed by Alan Cottrell and A. A. Wells.A. A. Wells, Crack Propagation Symposium, Cranfield, (1961) 210 This parameter became known as CTOD. G. R. Irwin later postulated that crack-tip plasticity makes the crack behave as if it were slightly longer. Thus, estimation of CTOD can be done by solving for the displacement at the physical crack tip.  Use as a design parameter  CTOD is a single parameter that accommodates crack tip plasticity. It is easy to measure when compared with techniques such as J integral. It is a fracture parameter that has more physical meaning than the rest. However, the equivalence of CTOD and J integral is proven only for non-linear materials, but not for plastic materials. It is hard to expand the concept of CTOD for large deformations. It is easier to calculate J-integral in case of a design process using finite element method techniques.  Relation with other crack tip parameters   K and CTOD  CTOD can be expressed in terms of stress intensity factor K as: :\\\\delta_\\\\text{t} = \\\\frac{4}{\\\\pi}\\\\frac{K^2}{m\\\\sigma_\\\\text{y} E} where \\\\sigma_\\\\text{y} is the yield strength, E is Young's modulus and m=1 for plane stress and m=2 for plane strain.  J-integral and CTOD  The relationship between the CTOD and J is given by: :\\\\delta_\\\\text{t} = d_n \\\\frac{J}{\\\\sigma_\\\\text{y}} where the variable d_n is typically between 0.3 and 0.8.  Testing  A CTOD test is usually done on materials that undergo plastic deformation prior to failure. The testing material more or less resembles the original one, although dimensions can be reduced proportionally. Loading is done to resemble the expected load. More than 3 tests are done to minimize any experimental deviations. The dimensions of the testing material must maintain proportionality. The specimen is placed on the work table and a notch is created exactly at the centre. The crack should be generated such that the defect length is about half the depth. The load applied on the specimen is generally a three-point bending load. A type of strain gauge called a crack- mouth clip gage is used to measure the crack opening. The crack tip plastically deforms until a critical point after which a cleavage crack is initiated that may lead to either partial or complete failure. The critical load and strain gauge measurements at the load are noted and a graph is plotted. The crack tip opening can be calculated from the length of the crack and opening at the mouth of the notch. According to the material used, the fracture can be brittle or ductile which can be concluded from the graph. Standards for CTOD testing can be found in the ASTM E1820 - 20a code.  Laboratory measurement  Early experiments used a flat, paddle-shaped gauge that was inserted into the crack; as the crack opens, the paddle gauge rotates and an electronic signal is sent to an x‚Äìy plotter. This method was inaccurate, however, because it was difficult to reach the crack tip with the paddle gauge. Today, the displacement V at the crack mouth is measured and the CTOD is inferred by assuming that the specimen halves are rigid and rotate about a hinge point.B E Amstutz, M A Sutton, D S Dawicke\\"An Experimental study of CTOD for mode I/mode II stable crack growth in thin aluminium specimens\\", ASTM Special 1995  References  Category:Fracture mechanics ","title":"Crack tip opening displacement"},{"id":"39145576","text":"Lake Yarinacocha (possibly from Quechua yarina ivory palm, qucha lake) is a lake in Peru located in the Ucayali Region, Coronel Portillo Province, Yarinacocha District.

In 1860, he was involved in investigating the Constance Kent murder case, which was the subject of Kate Summerscale's 2008 book The Suspicions of Mr Whicher, as well as the film of the same name. He was one of the inspirations for Charles Dickens‚Äôs Inspector Bucket, Colin Dexter‚Äôs Inspector Morse, Wilkie Collins's Sergeant Cuff and R. D.

Accessed 18 January 2017 Whicher was reportedly described by a colleague as the \\"prince of detectives\\". Charles Dickens, who met him, described him as \\"shorter and thicker-set\\" than his fellow officers, marked with smallpox scars and possessed of \\"a reserved and thoughtful air, as if he were engaged in deep arithmetical calculations\\".'The Prince of Sleuths' ‚Äì The Guardian 5 April 2008] William Henry Wills, Dickens's deputy editor at Household Words magazine, saw Whicher involved in police work in 1850 and described him as a \\"man of mystery\\". In May 1851 Whicher was accused of entrapment when he and Inspector Lund saw John Tyler, a convict who had been transported to Australia as a criminal and had recently returned, in Trafalgar Square. Whicher and Lund watched Tyler meet William Cauty, another known criminal, and sit with him on a bench in The Mall opposite the London and Westminster Bank in St James's Square. Whicher and Lund watched the two as they returned to the same bench every day for six weeks and watched the bank. Eventually, on 28 June 1851 they caught the two red-handed as they ran from the bank having robbed it. The Times criticised the police for allowing the crime to take place rather than preventing it. Whicher also pursued criminals who counterfeited coins, forged signatures on cheques and money orders, as well as pickpockets and conmen. In 1854 Whicher was involved in the capture of the valet who stole ten pictures including the 'Virgin and Child' by Leonardo da Vinci (then valued at ¬£4,000) from the home of the Earl of Suffolk near Malmesbury. The valet and his accomplices were unable to sell the pictures and they were discovered under one of the arches of Blackfriars Bridge.'Stolen Pictures' ‚Äì The Lotus Magazine Vol. 6, No. 4, January 1915 pg 205 Whicher was promoted to detective-inspector in 1856. When Italian revolutionaries organised by Felice Orsini tried to assassinate Napoleon III in 1858 in Paris, Whicher took part in the hunt to track them down. In 1859 he investigated when the Reverend James Bonwell, the married rector of St Philip the Apostle in Stepney and his lover Miss Lizzie Yorath, a clergyman's daughter, were charged with murdering their illegitimate son. Bonwell had paid an undertaker 18 shillings to bury the dead child secretly in a coffin with a deceased stranger. The couple were found not guilty of murder but were censured by the jury, and in 1860 Archibald Tait, the Bishop of London, sued Bonwell for misconduct.'The Rev. James Bonwell's Case Judgement' ‚Äì Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal, Wednesday 2 October 1861, p.2, at Trove\\"6 June 1860‚ÄîThe Disgraceful Case at Stepney\\" ‚Äì The Victorian Calendar In early 1860 Whicher caught Emily Lawrence and James Pearce, who had stolen ¬£12,000 worth of jewellery from jewellers' shops in Paris by examining valuable items on trays and then palming them.  The Murder at Road Hill House  Constance Kent in 1860 Detective Inspector Jonathan \\"Jack\\" Whicher's fame had spread, and he was at the height of his powers when in July 1860 he was sent by Scotland Yard to assist the local police in the small village of Rode (then in Wiltshire) in investigating the murder of 3-year-old Francis Saville Kent. By this time Whicher had already solved several notorious crimes and had gained a reputation for being able to solve the most difficult cases. Francis Saville Kent had been taken from his nursemaid Elizabeth Gough's bedroom during the night of Friday 29 June 1860 and his body was found the next morning dumped in an outside privy used by the servants in the garden of his family's house. His throat had been cut, among other injuries. Local Police Superintendent Foley believed that the nursemaid, Elizabeth Gough, who had responsibility for Francis Kent, who slept in her room, was involved in the murder. His theory was that she and a lover, possibly the child's father, had woken the child up and had killed him in order to silence him, at the same time opening a window to make it look as if an intruder had gained access to the house and had killed the child. During the early part of the investigation, a heavily bloodstained nightgown was found lodged in a chimney in the house. Superintendent Foley ordered that this should be replaced so that a watch could be kept on it, hoping that the murderer would return to destroy this crucial piece of evidence. This went wrong when the two constables ordered to watch over the nightgown were locked in the kitchen. Before they were released the nightgown had vanished. Foley was afraid that the incompetence of his officers might result in punishment for him and for them. As a result, he deliberately did not inform the authorities of the find and its subsequent disappearance.\\"A Crime Which Puzzled A Nation\\", in The History of Wiltshire Constabulary, p 16] Dissatisfied by the lack of progress of Superintendent Foley and his men, the local magistrates asked the Home Office for assistance from Scotland Yard without the agreement of the local chief constable, Captain Samuel Meredith R.N.. It was only after a second request was received that Whicher, then the most senior and best known of the detectives at Scotland Yard, was sent. Whicher concentrated his investigation on the missing nightgown belonging to 16-year-old Constance Kent, the murdered child's older half-sister from their father's first marriage; there was also circumstantial evidence against her. The magistrates ordered her arrest and gave Whicher seven days to prepare his case. Whicher then requested the assistance of a detective-sergeant from Scotland Yard, becoming the first police inspector to make such a request.History of the Metropolitan Police , at Metropolitan Police website Her father Samuel Saville Kent (1801‚Äì1872) engaged the services of an experienced barrister to defend his daughter. Constance Kent was released on bail and the case against her was later dropped due to lack of evidence. The nightgown, a crucial piece of evidence, was never found, and Superintendent Foley never told Whicher about its original discovery. The national newspapers strongly supported the young Constance and were critical of Whicher. He returned to London where he was seen as a failure because he had failed to solve the case and thus damaged the reputation of the Detective Branch. It took some time for his reputation to recover. Constance Kent's confession In April 1865 Constance Kent was prosecuted for the murder of her younger half-brother. She had made a statement confessing her guilt to an Anglo-Catholic clergyman, the Rev. Arthur Wagner, and she expressed to him her resolution to give herself up to justice. He assisted her in carrying out this resolution, and he gave evidence of this statement before the magistrates. But he prefaced his evidence by a declaration that he must withhold any further information on the ground that it had been received under the seal of \\"sacramental confession\\". He was but lightly pressed by the magistrates, the fact of the matter being that the prisoner was not defending the charge.Nolan, R. S. (1913) \\"The Law of the Seal of Confession\\", Catholic Encyclopaedia The substance of the confession was that she had waited until the family and servants were asleep, had gone down to the drawing-room and opened the shutters and window, had then taken the child from his room wrapped in a blanket that she had taken from between sheet and counterpane in his cot (leaving both these undisturbed or readjusted), left the house and killed him in the privy with a razor stolen from her father. Her movements before the killing had been conducted with the child in her arms. It had been necessary to hide matches in the privy beforehand for a light to see by during the act of murder. The murder was not a spontaneous act, it seems, but one of revenge against the second Mrs Kent for her treatment of Constance's mother ‚Äì and it was even suggested that Constance had, at certain times, been mentally unbalanced.\\"Glimpses into the 19th Century Broadside Ballad Trade No. 15: Constance Kent and the Road Murder Later years Following the death of his first wife, Whicher married Charlotte Piper (1812‚Äì1883) in 1866 at St Margaret's, Westminster.

It specifies restrictions placed on movement and regards it as a strictly local process. This term was first defined by Noam Chomsky in 1973 and constitutes the main concept of the Government and Binding Theory. The revised definition of subjacency from Chomsky (1977) is as follows: \\"A cyclic rule cannot move a phrase from position Y to position X (or conversely) in ‚Ä¶ X ‚Ä¶ [Œ±‚Ä¶ [Œ≤‚Ä¶ Y ‚Ä¶ ] ‚Ä¶ ] ‚Ä¶ X ‚Ä¶, where Œ± and Œ≤ are cyclic nodes. Cyclic nodes are S and NP\\",(Chomsky 1977: 73) (where S=Sentence and NP=Noun Phrase). This principle states that no movement can move an element over more than one bounding node at a time. In more recent frameworks, bounding nodes which are hurdles to movement are AgrP (Agreement phrase) and DP (Determiner phrase) (S and NP in Chomsky‚Äôs definition respectively). Therefore, Subjacency condition limits movement by defining bounding nodes. It also accounts for the fact that all movements are local.  The subjacency condition in examples  The notion of bounding was first observed in the early generative grammar by, for instance, John R. Ross (1967). He noticed that movement is impossible out of certain phrases called Extraction islands. This evidence was further interpreted in terms of the Government and Binding Theory and Subjacency condition in the following way: (1) whoi did [AGRP Mary think [CP ti [AGRP John saw ti ] (2) *whoi did [AGRP John ask [CP whenj [AGRP ti fixed the car tj ] (3) *whoi did [AGRP John believe [DP the statement [CP ti that [AGRP Bill hit ti For more examples see Cook and Newson (2007). In (1) the wh-element moves out of the object position of the embedded clause via cyclic movement, crossing only one AgrP at a time. Thereby, it respects the Subjacency condition and the sentence is grammatical. The details of this movement are presented in the diagram below: (1) File:Rys1.jpg As the specifier of CP position is empty in (1), the wh- element may use it as an escape hatch before moving further. In the example (2), on the other hand, the specifier of CP position is already taken and the wh-element moves over two AgrP at a time, violating the Subjacency condition and yielding the ungrammatical sentence.

It contains only one species, Spinivalva gaucha, which is found in Brazil. The length of the forewings is 2.78‚Äì3.61 mm. The forewings are mostly covered by dark-grey scales. There is a narrow stripe of white scales along the posterior margin. A zigzag edge, formed by short, oblique white fascia, separates this stripe from the remaining, mostly dark-grey area. The hindwings are completely covered by dark-grey scales. The larvae feed on Passiflora actinia, Passiflora misera and Passiflora suberosa. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow, slightly serpentine gallery, increasing in width progressively and becoming a blotch during the last larval instar. The larva feeds on the palisade parenchyma. Dark-green granular frass pellets are deposited throughout the mine. The larva leaves the mine through a slit made in the blotch section. Pupation takes place in a cocoon, usually made on the adaxial leaf surface of adjacent leaves. Etymology The genus name is derived from Latin spina (meaning spine) and valve (meaning valve) and refers to the conspicuous spine-like process present on the male valvae. The specific name is derived from the Portuguese Ga√∫cho, a term commonly used for natives of Rio Grande do Sul, the state in Brazil where the new species was first found.A new Brazilian Passiflora leafminer: Spinivalva gaucha, gen. n., sp. n.

Pamiƒôtnik handlowca (\\"A Mercantilist's memoir\\" or \\"Memoirs of a Merchant\\") is the name of a purported diary written by Polish merchant Zbigniew Stefanski in 1625. No copy of the original text is known to exist. The diary was to have been written in \\"old polish\\" and contain a first-hand account of the Jamestown Colony in Virginia. It was claimed to be the only extant primary source from the Jamestown Colony from the perspective of the Polish artisans brought in by Captain John Smith in 1608. The memoir is said to have surfaced in Chicago, Illinois in 1947 when a person offered to sell it to Mieczyslaw Haiman, then director of the Polish Museum of America. The memoir is to have revealed much about the Jamestown colony, and to have presented details about how Polish settlers taught the pioneers how to dig wells for drinking water, fought a strike for their right to vote, and introduced the settlers to baseball. The book also was to have confirmed the names of the six Polish settlers in Jamestown, which had previously been known only from secondary sources, often written over 100 years later. The purported existence of the diary may have helped change the perception of Jamestown history; it is known from primary English sources that the Poles were hired as skilled artisans, but in Stefanski's memoir, the six men were to have been presented as merchants (or at least trading officials) in Poland.Waldo. True Heroes of Jamestown. p. 210. According to several sources, two of the craftsmen helped save the life of Captain John Smith \\"during a surprise attack from the local Indians\\" (also noted in \\"Smith's own journals\\"). Later, on June 30, 1619, the craftsmen conducted the first labor strike (first \\"in American history\\") for democratic rights (\\"No Vote, No Work\\") in Jamestown. When the British Crown overturned the legislation by the Virginia House of Burgesses and granted the workers equal voting rights on July 21, 1619, the labor strike was ended and work was resumed.

He started to write from an early age and he often published articles in the magazine \\"Zeruko Argia\\". In 1965 he created a band of Basque Music with Mikel Laboa, Benito Lertxundi, Joxean Artze, Jose Angel Irigarai and Lourdes Iriondo. The band, which was called \\"Ez Dok Amairu\\", disappeared in 1972, but Xabier Lete kept on singing with Lourdes Iriondo, who, by that time, had become his wife. In 1968, Lete published his first book of poems and in October 2009 he won the Basque Literature Award for his last book of poems \\"Egunsentiaren esku izotzak\\" (Frozen hands of the dawn). He received a hard blow in 2005 when his wife Lourdes died after an illness. In April 2009, Lete was made member of Jakiunde, the Basque Academy of Science, Art and Letters, and in 2010, he was named member of honor of the Academy of the Basque Language. Xabier Lete died that same year, on December 4, due to an serious illness and after stays in two different hospitals. Biography Singer Xabier Lete during a performance of the band Ez Dok Amairu September 9, 1971 Xabier Lete studied in La Salle school in Herrera, Donostia. After graduating high school, he went to Tarragona to do technical studies, but he didn¬¥t finish them. Instead, he went to the cinema and spent his time reading. When he returned to the Basque Country, he started to work in a factory in Pasaia (Gipuzkoa), where he started to write his first poems. He had been an enthusiastic about reading since he was young, and he started to write early. He started to write for the \\"Zeruko Argiak\\" magazine in 1965. Xabier Lete also had a close relationship with the world of acting, being a member of the group Lartaun in Oiartzun. He met Joxean Artze thanks to Julen Lekuona, an acquaintance from his town. He took part in the birth of the group Ez Dok Amairu, and it was Jorge Oteiza the man who gave the name to the band. This well-known sculptor¬¥s dream was to create a movement for the recovery of the Basque Culture, which would gather all the artistic disciplines. In the area of music, that goal had its answer in the band Ez Dok Amairu. These were years of Francoist Spain. But enough Basques were willing to do something to improve the situation, and thus, answering that desire, the songs became screams. Unfortunately, in 1970 the band broke up after they performed the \\"Baga, biga, higa\\" show. Lete collaborated with other singers, such as Antton Valverde, for instance, with whom he gave voice to the poems of Lizardi and of Txirrita between 1975 and 1978. Xabier Lete also worked in the world of acting with the aim of setting the foundation for a modern Basque theatre. He met Eugenio Arozena at that time and he worked with him. The works that emerged from that cooperation led to new groups of theatre in Oiartzun. The most important part of Lete¬¥s songs are the underlying poems and the words that are said in them, even though the music was very often composed by him too. Apart from his own words, Lete also sang other singers' songs, such as Lizardi¬¥s or Jacques Brel¬¥s. In the same way, other singers have also used Lete¬¥s poems for their musical works, such as Mikel Laboa, Antton Valverde, Imanol Larzabal or Benito Lertxundi, for example. Poet Lete started to write poetry in 1964 and published his first book of poems in 1968: \\"Egunetik egunera orduen gurpilean\\" (From day to day in the wheels of the hours). In this work it was noticeable the influence of Gabriel Aresti¬¥s social poetry and Lete used his words to denounce the societal injustices of the time. That is why he criticized poets who avoided upsetting those in power or who simply got lost in stylistic games avoiding dealing with social realities. His second book of poems was published in 1974 and its name was \\"Bigarren poema liburua\\" (Second book of poems). This work was much more intimate than the first one. Influenced by French existentialist philosophy, Lete reflected more on topics such as life and death. The next book of poems came in 1981: \\"Urrats desbideratuak\\" (The diverted steps) in which the language became stronger and the poems reflected pessimism and despair giving way to philosophical thoughts influenced by Nietzsche. Once he recovered from an illness he had, Lete published his fourth book of poems in 1992: \\"Zentzu antzanldatuen poemategia\\" (The book of poems of transmuted senses). He received the Felipe Arrese Beitia poetry prize, given by Euskaltzaindia (The Academy of the Basque Language). Shortly afterwards, a revised edition of that book came out with a different name: \\"Biziaren ikurrak\\" (The symbols of life). In 2009 Lete received an award for his book of poems \\"Egunsentiaren esku izotzak\\" and that same year he was made member of Jakiunde, the Basque Academy of Science, Art and Letters. Politician After his third publication, Lete abandoned for a while the world of literature to fully get into politics. During the 80¬¥s he occupied the posts of General Director, then Councillor, after that he got into the Department of Culture of Gipuzkoa¬¥s Local Council, but due to health problems, he definitely gave up public activity.

It was constructed between 1887 and 1892, under the supervision of Melbourne Harbour Trust engineer Joseph Brady, to modified designs of British engineer Sir John Coode. Victoria Dock in the 1920s It is the oldest and largest surviving single dock in the world. The water basin covers 37.6 hectares (96 acres) and the entrance at the western end is 61 metres wide. It was built to accommodate ships of 9.5m draft, with initially timber wharf sheds and wharfs around the perimeter, supplemented by a piled timber central pier in 1919 extending from the east edge of the dock. At its greatest extent it accommodated 21 berths, although this has been substantially reduced as the land area has been redeveloped for the Docklands commercial and residential towers. The Central Pier, a later addition, retains two sheds but has been reduced to half its size. It was used as a dance venue, events, functions and entertainmentMelbourne Docklands History and Heritage Destination Docklands until August 2019 when it was declared unsafe. In January 2020 it was shut down indefinitely because it would take \\"tens of millions of dollars\\" to rebuild to a safe standard. Portal and semi portal level luffing cranes once served timber and steel framed wharf sheds, all but three of which have been demolished. The oldest, dating from 1913, were along the eastern edge and were purported to have been dismantled for future restoration of the central pier sheds, two of which survive. All the cranes have been removed but crane rails survive on some wharf aprons. In the 1950s the dock handled over two million tons of cargo annually, increasing to 20 million revenue tons annually by the mid 1980s.

Even if part of the south face of the mountain is on the Trevi√±o exclave, (Burgos), the summit is itself on Alava. Next to the summit, some metres below, there is the Zaldiarango gaina, with a height of 780 metres (2559 ft); a mountain pass that communicates Alava with the Trevi√±o exclave at its highest point, where the frontier is located. The roads that communicate these two provinces are the A-3102 that comes from Alava and the BU-742, which heads for Trevi√±o exclave. At the top of the mountain, apart from a tall metallic cross that was placed in 1950 by the hiker club Manuel Iradier, there are a few big aerials that transmit television and radio signal to Vitoria-Gasteiz.

The route begins in this village, at the foot of Zaldiaran on the highway that goes to the Zaldiaran mountain pass. After following this road 200 metres the trail arrives to an esplanade (left), next to a large aerial. Opposite there is a water tank. At the right of the tank starts a narrow path, which runs through a pine forest upwards. At the exit of the pinewood the trail is abandoned and a narrow path at the left is followed. The route follows the ridge and pursues another way (left). Then, the right way has to be taken on a bifurcation that divides the road. The forest is left behind and a firewall heads to the top of Errogana. Following an almost flat terrain the route breaks through a beech. As soon as having entered the beech the trail deviates to the left. The wood is crossed by a diagonal footway that ends on the road which ascends to the relay tower located on the summit. Flora Northern slopes of Zaldiaran are full of beeches (Fagus sylvatica) that give way to Portuguese Oaks (Quercus faginea) woods on lower parts of the mountain. Curiosities *Every 1 January, all the hiking clubs of Vitoria- Gasteiz come together at this mountain to inaugurate the mountaineering year. *It is said that at the Middle Age a castle was built in the summit of Zaldiaran, which was finally abandoned and then used as a fort by the French Army on the Battle of Vitoria on 1813.
