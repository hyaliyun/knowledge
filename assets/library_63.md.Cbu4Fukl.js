Relations went into decline after 1950 over Portugal's refusal to surrender its exclaves of Goa, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli on India's west coast. By 1955, the two nations had cut off diplomatic relations, triggering a crisis which precipitated in the Indian annexation of Portuguese India in 1961. Portugal refused to recognise Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories until 1974 when, following the Carnation Revolution, the new government in Lisbon recognised Indian sovereignty and restored diplomatic relations.  Background  Prior to Indian independence Portugal's relations with the British Indian Empire were derived from those with the United Kingdom, set within the framework of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373.Jo√£o Ferreira Duarte, \\"The Politics of Non-Translation: A Case Study in Anglo-Portuguese Relations\\", This treaty, signed between King Edward III of England and Ferdinand I and Queen Eleanor of Portugal, established \\"perpetual friendships, unions [and] alliances\\" between the two seafaring nations and is the world's oldest active treaty.\\"Closing The Ring\\", Churchill, Sir Winston Spencer, 1951 This led to amicable relations‚Äîespecially with regard to trade and transport between British and Portuguese colonies in the India. Commencement of relations: 1947‚Äì1950 Relations between Portugal and the Indian Union were quite cordial in 1947, particularly in light of Portuguese willingness to terminate the old Padroado treaty with the Holy See, which had traditionally given the Archbishop of Goa 'patriarchal' authority over other parts of India. On 12 August 1948, India and Portugal exchanged diplomatic missions. Goa dispute: 1950‚Äì61 As of the creation of the Republic of India in January 1950, Portugal held a handful of territories on the Indian subcontinent--the districts of Goa, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli--collectively known as the Estado da √çndia. Goa, Damman and Diu covered an area of around and had a population of 637,591.Numbers from 1955, thus excludes Dadra and Nagar-Haveli. The bulk (547,448) was in Goa (composed of the districts of Old and New Goa, Bardez, Mormug√£o and Salsete, and the offshore island of Anjediva), remainder in Damman (69,005) and Diu (21,138). See Kay (1970) Salazar and Modern Portugal, New York: Hawthorn, p. 295) The Goan diaspora was estimated at 175,000 (about 100,000 within the Indian Union).H. Kay (1970) Salazar and Modern Portugal, New York: Hawthorn Its religious distribution was 61% Hindu, 36.7% Christian (mostly Catholic), 2.2% Muslim. The economy was primarily based on agriculture, although the 1940s and 1950s saw a boom in mining--principally iron ore and some manganese. Portugal's steadfast refusal to cede these territories caused relations with India to decline. Armed conflict commenced in December 1961. Opening of negotiations over Goa Goa, Western India On 27 February 1950, the Government of India asked the Portuguese government to open negotiations about the future of these colonies. This followed Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru's statement that \\"Goa is part of the Indian Union and it shall return.\\" On 15 July 1950, the Portuguese government responded by declaring that the question presented \\"could not be discussed, much less accept the solution that was proposed.\\" Portugal asserted that its territory in India was not a colony but part of metropolitan Portugal and hence its transfer was non-negotiable; and that the India had no rights to this territory since the Republic of India did not exist when Goa came under Portuguese rule. The Portuguese constitution, which affirmed that the diplomatic and military defence of sovereignty was imperative,Jos√© Krus Abecasis, OS TRANSPORTES A√âREOS DA √çNDIA PORTUGUESA (TAIP) E A FOR√áA A√âREA, Theme Lecture at Sociedade de Geografia de Lisboa, 23 March 2002 was amended in 1951 to explicitly designate colonies in India and Africa as 'Overseas Colonies' although Goa had been treated as one since 1518.Goa was first recognised as equal to the metropolis in the Royal Charter of 1518, and affirmed in subsequent legislation. The term 'province' was first used in 1576, and the term 'overseas provinces' used in virtually all legislation and constitutions thereafter, e.g. Art.1-3 & Art. 162-64 of 1822 Constitution online, 1826 constitution online, Art. I & Title X of the constitution of 1838 online, Title V of the Republican constitution of 1911 online and the 1932 Constitution of the Estado Novo. In January 1953, the Indian government sent an aide memoire to the Portuguese government pointing out that \\"political barriers artificially created by an accident of history for which no justification existed at the present time can no longer stem the rising tide of the national urge for unity.\\" Further the government assured the Portuguese Government that it would \\"maintain cultural and other rights, including language, laws and customs of the inhabitants of these territories and make no changes in such and like matters except with their consent.\\" When the Portuguese Government refused to respond to the aides memoirs, the Indian government, on 11 June 1953, withdrew its diplomatic mission from Lisbon. Lambert Mascarenhas, \\"Goa's Freedom Movement,\\" excerpted from Henry Scholberg, Archana Ashok Kakodkar and Carmo Azevedo, Bibliography of Goa and the Portuguese in India New Delhi, Promilla (1982) In the course of 1954, the Portuguese appealed to Great Britain to bring pressure on India. Foreign secretary Alec Douglas-Home made it absolutely clear that the NATO alliance did not extend to Portuguese entanglements overseas, and that they should not expect anything more than a mediating role. He also warned that if Portugal invoked the old Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, Britain's response would be constrained, as she had no intention of engaging in hostilities with a member of the Commonwealth.Kay (1970), p.323 India attempted to use its position in the Non-Aligned Movement to gain support for its demands, while Portugal, as a founding member of NATO sought support amongst Western nations, as well as with India's rivals, Pakistan and China.Comrades at odds: The United States and India, 1947-1964 By Andrew Jon Rotter Pg 185 Estrangement By 1954, the Republic of India instituted visa restrictions on travel from Goa to India which paralysed travel between Goa and other Portuguese exclaves in India. Meanwhile, the Indian union of dock workers had, in 1954, instituted a boycott on shipping to Portuguese India.Sankar Ghose (1993) Jawaharlal Nehru: A biography.

Prabhakar (2003) Wars, proxy-wars and terrorism: post independent India New Delhi: Mittal, p.39 On 30 November 1954, Ant√≥nio Salazar addressed the Portuguese parliament, laying out the Portuguese position on Goa.

In one incident at Banda, Portuguese and Goan policemen armed with rifles and sten guns and assisted by Portuguese and African soldiers from Mozambique opened fire on a group of 30 unarmed activists wounding one woman and two men in the presence of international journalists. The shooting stopped when CBS cameraman Arthur Bonner and United Press International correspondent John Hlavacek, intervened and rescued the injured activists. The news of the shooting built public opinion in India against the Portuguese. Communist parties led protests marked by rioting in several locations as well as fomenting strikes in several factories demanding an armed response. Nehru described the Portuguese reaction as \\"brutal and uncivilized in the extreme.\\" but added: \\"We will not be forced or hustled into what we consider wrong action. The Portuguese are deliberately trying to provoke us.\\" The press in India was sharply critical of Nehru's position on Goa. The Times of India attacked him for \\"vacillation, contradiction and appeasement\\", while the Bombay Free Press Journal accused him of \\"obliquely encouraging the satyagrahis with vague, irresponsible statements that satyagraha will solve the problems of Goan freedom.\\" Subsequent to the incidents on 15 August 1955, the Government of India imposed restrictions on people going to Goa as satyagrahis. On 1 September 1955, India shut its consulate in Goa.Francisco Monteiro - India supported banditry in Goa In August 1955, Portuguese prime minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar stated that there would be no transfer to sovereignty \\"by peaceful means.\\" On 17 September 1955, Nehru stated that reliance on peaceful methods to bring Goa into India \\"is not only a sound policy, but the only possible policy.\\"After Nehru, Who? by Welles Hangen, Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc., 1963, p. 92 In 1956, Portuguese ambassador to France, Marcello Mathias, along with prime minister Salazar, argued in favour of a referendum in Goa to determine its future. This proposal was however rejected by the ministers for defence and foreign affairs. The demand for a referendum was again made by presidential candidate General Humberto Delgado in 1957. In 1957, the Indian army deployed anti-aircraft missiles near Daman and Diu airfields and threatened to shoot down any aircraft that strayed into Indian airspace whilst taking off or landing at the newly built airports at these locations. On 3 April 1958, the Indian Government partially lifted the 1955 restrictions on Indian nationals and residents, permitting them to come to Goa, Daman and Diu, which they had been deprived of since the removal of the Indian Consulate in that city (Pangim), at the beginning of blockade and closure of the frontiers.Francisco Monteiro, Chronology of Terrorist Activity Unleashed by the Indian Union Against the Territories of Goa, Damao and Diu UN involvement in Goa crisis On 14 December 1960, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 1514 (XV) urging all countries to take steps to place their colonies and non-self-governing territories on the road to self-determination in accordance with Article 73 of the UN Charter.Resolution 1514 (XV) Portugal claimed this resolution did not apply to them, as her colonies were overseas provinces, constitutionally integral to the nation, and thus exempt. On 15 December 1960, the UNGA passed Resolution 1541 laying out 12 conditions by which the UNGA would determine the definition of a non-self-governing territory.UNGA Resolution 1541 . Resolution 1541 incorporated the principles recommended by the Committee of Six established by UNGA Resolution 1467 (XIV) on 12 December 1959 to enumerate \\"the principles which guide members in determining whether or not an obligation exists to transmit the information called for in article 73(e)\\". In its initial application the United Nations in December 1955, Portugal replied it possessed no non-self-governing territories falling under Article 73(e). See F. Nogueira, (1963) The United Nations and Portugal, London: Sidgwick & Jackson, p. 139ff. This was immediately followed by Resolution 1542 declaring that nine Portuguese overseas provinces met these conditions and were to be considered \\"non-self-governing\\" territories for the purposes of Resolution 1514, even if the Portuguese constitution did not recognise them as such.  Indian support to partisan movements in Goa  In addition to non-violent protests, armed groups such as Azad Gomantak Dal (Free Goa Party) and the United Front of Goans conducted violent attacks aimed at weakening Portuguese rule in Goa. The Indian government supported the establishment of armed groups such as Azad Gomantak Dal, giving them full financial, logistic and armament support. The armed groups acted from bases situated in Indian territory and under cover of Indian police forces. The Indian government‚Äîthrough these armed groups - attempted to destroy economic targets, telegraph and telephone lines, road, water and rail transport, in order to impede economic activity and create conditions for a general uprising. Commenting on the armed resistance, Portuguese army officer, then- Captain Carlos Azaredo (now retired General) stationed with the army in Goa states in Portuguese newspaper O Expresso: \\"To the contrary to what is being said, the most evolved guerrilla warfare which our Armed Forces encountered was in Goa. I know what I'm talking about, because I also fought in Angola and in Guin√©. In 1961 alone, until December, around 80 policemen died. The major part of Azad Gomantak Dal were not Goans. Many had fought in the British Army under General Montgomery, against the Germans.\\" International efforts at reconciliation Portugal's prime minister Salazar, alarmed by India‚Äôs hints of armed action, first asked the United Kingdom to mediate, then protested through Brazil and eventually asked the United Nations Security Council to intervene.Comrades at Odds: The United States and India Page 185 Meanwhile, on 6 December, Mexico offered the Indian government its influence in Latin America to bring pressure on the Portuguese to relieve tensions.US Department of State, Central Files, 753D.00/12 - 561. Document 66, Meanwhile, Krishna Menon, India‚Äôs defence minister and head of India‚Äôs UN delegation, stated that India had not \\"abjured the use of force\\" in Goa, and went on to link Goa to Angola, condemning Portugal‚Äôs colonisation policies in both cases. Indian forces were, at the time, serving in Congo as part of a UN operation and had been involved in the fighting. American diplomatic initiatives to prevent armed conflict had to balance its relationship with India and its NATO alliance with Portugal, and to dispel the idea that such initiatives were being made under pressure from the Portuguese government, while avoiding NATO involvement. The US government stopped short of suggesting self-determination for the people of Goa, unready to apply that policy to all other Portuguese holdings worldwide, and would damage US‚ÄìPortugal relations.US Department of State, NEA/SOA Files: Lot 64 D 240, Goa - Internal Memoranda. Document 65, Item 10 The American ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith, repeatedly requested the Indian government to resolve the issue peacefully through mediation and consensus rather than armed conflict.US Department of State, Central Files, 753D.00/12 - 1161 Document 68US Department of State, Central Files, 753D.00/12 - 1261 Document 69 Nehru postponed the invasion of Goa and expressed his willingness to negotiate on the condition that Portugal first announce its intentions to withdraw from Goa. This condition was rejected by the Portuguese as contrary to the spirit of a negotiation. United States President John F. Kennedy, in a message to Nehru, argued that if India used force against Goa, this, along with its military presence in Congo, would make an otherwise Gandhian nation look belligerent. On 8 December, C. S. Jha, India's delegate at the United Nations Security Council, expressed India's disregard for international pressure by stating: \\"(The invasion of Goa) is a question of getting rid of the last vestiges of colonialism in India. That is a matter of faith with us. Whatever anyone else may think, Charter or no Charter, Council or no Council, that is our basic faith which we cannot afford to give up at any cost.\\"U.N.S.C.O.R., 16th Session, 987th mtg. at 9, ¬∂40, U.N. Doc. S/PV. 987 (1961) quoted by Nathaniel Berman, \\"Legitimacy Through Defiance\\", page 10 On 14 December, Acting UN Secretary-General U Thant addressed identical letters to Nehru and Salazar. He urged them to \\"ensure that the situation does not deteriorate to the extent that it might constitute a threat to peace and security\\", and to enter into negotiations to solve the problem.Public Papers of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations, Vol. VI: U Thant, 1961 - 1964, p. 74 Document 75 Eventually, on 10 December, nine days prior to the invasion, Nehru announced that \\"Continuance of Goa under Portuguese rule is an impossibility\\". The US response was to warn India that if and when India‚Äôs armed action in Goa was brought to the UN Security Council, it could expect no support from the US delegation.US Department of State, Central Files, 753D.00/12 - 1461 Document 72 Attack on the Sabarmati On 24 November 1961, the Sabarmati, a passenger boat passing between the Portuguese-held island of Angediva and the Indian port of Kochi, was fired upon by Portuguese ground troops resulting in injuries to the chief engineer of the boat and the death of a passenger. The action was precipitated by Portuguese fears that the boat carried a military landing team intent on storming the island. A Portuguese investigation into the matter revealed that the boat had also been fired upon seven days earlier, when it accidentally strayed into Goan waters.Remembering the Fall of Portuguese India in 1961 The incidents fostered widespread support in India for military action. Annexation of Goa Following the breakdown of diplomatic efforts, India conducted an armed invasion of Goa, Daman and Diu on 18 December 1961, supported by artillery, air and naval forces. The armed action, codenamed Operation Vijay by the Indian government, involved air, sea and land strikes for over 36 hours. A decisive victory for India, it drove the Portuguese to surrender. Aftermath In 1974 a democratic government took power in Portugal. The two countries signed a treaty in New Delhi on 31 December 1974, re-establishing diplomatic relations. Embassies were reopened,India-Portugal Relations, Indian ministry of External Affairs, Sep 2010 the Indian Embassy in June 1975, and the Portuguese Embassy in July 1975. What Is India News Service, Saturday, 5 May 2007 The Portuguese government remained vulnerable and unstable until in 1987 the Social Democratic Party (PSD) gained an absolute majority. This introduced an era of stability keeping bilateral interaction between India and Portugal at a low ebb. A bilateral Agreement on Trade, Economic, Industrial and Technical Cooperation was signed in 1977 and a Joint Committee established under this Agreement first met in November 1981. Increasing diplomatic contacts Ant√≥nio Costa shakes hands with Narendra Modi in January 2017.

President Venkataraman in 1990 and President KR Narayanan in 1998 made state visits in addition to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the first India- Portugal Summit in June 2000. An√≠bal Cavaco Silva paid a state visit in January 2007 followed by the visit of Prime Minister Jose Socrates in December 2007. Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Costa paid yet another visit in January 2017. Parliamentary exchanges commenced in 1999 with a visit of 9 ministers from Portugal led by Dr. Antonio de Almeida Santos, Speaker of the National Assembly of the Portuguese Republic from 15‚Äì22 December 1999. Dr. Joao Bosco Mota Amaral, Speaker of Parliament then led a 4-member delegation to the Golden Jubilee celebrations of India's Parliament on 21‚Äì25 January 2003. India dispatched a 12-member Parliamentary Delegation led by Manohar Joshi, Speaker of the Lok Sabha to Portugal from 25‚Äì28 May 2003 and a 16-member Parliamentary Goodwill Delegation led by Minister for Parliamentary Affairs & Information and Broadcasting, Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi visited on 6‚Äì7 November 2007.

Portugal President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is to make a four-day visit to India in 2020 or 2021. The last visit by a Portugal President to India was in 2007. Treaties and agreements In 1997 India and Portugal split the 1977 agreement into two separate segments-- one providing economic and industrial cooperation (signed at Lisbon in April 2000) and the other providing cooperation in science and technology (signed in December 1998). Another Agreement providing for avoidance of double taxation was signed in September 1998. Both these agreements had since entered into force with the completion of ratification procedures. A Cooperation Agreement was signed in January 1992, between the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and the Portuguese Institute for Foreign Trade and Investment (ICEP). A Joint Business Council established under this agreement met in 1993, 1995 and 1997. A Cooperation Agreement between Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Portuguese Association of Industries (AIP) was signed in July 1995. A Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (BIPPA) and an Agreement setting up a Joint Working Group on Information Technology were signed in June 2000.

India's exports constituted over 70% of the turnover. Indian exports consisted principally of marine products, cotton and synthetic textiles, leather, footwear, hides and skins, staple fibres, coffee, tea & spices. In the twenty-first century exports diversified to include items such as carpets, gems and jewellery, silk and silk products, tobacco, electrical machinery & parts, iron & steel products, dyeing & tanning products, and organic chemicals. Automobile spares and components, computer software, bicycles, scooters and other two wheelers, and rice have also been exported.

Its modern use as a given name originates from the transferred use of the English-language surname Randall, which in turn is derived from Randolph. There are several variant spellings of the English given name; these include Randal, Randel, Randell, Randle, and Rendell. The pet form is Randy. The form Randal has also used as an Anglicisation of an etymologically unrelated Irish and Scottish Gaelic name Raghnall. This Anglicisation has been noted as being particularly common amongst several Irish families of note. Randal has not been among the 1,000 most popular masculine baby names in the United States since 1994, and Randall has been among the top 1,000 names since 1906. According to US Census data, in 1990 both names were among the top 500 most popular masculine names in the country. Neither name is currently among the 100 most popular masculine (or feminine) baby names in either the United Kingdom nor the Republic of Ireland. Etymology and early history The modern given name Randall, , which cited: is derived from the transferred use of the surname Randall. There have been two explanations for the origin of this surname. One explanation is that the surname is derived from the Middle English personal name Randel. This name is a diminutive of the mediaeval personal name Rand compounded with the Anglo Norman hypocoristic suffix -el. which cited: for the surnames \\"Randal\\", \\"Randall\\". The Middle English Rand can be a short form of any of several names composed of the first element rand, meaning \\"shield\\" or \\"rim\\"; which cited: for the surnames \\"Rand\\", \\"Randolph\\". or the Old Norse short first name Randr (variant form Randi, Old Danish Rand),Nordic Names however the specific names associated with Randel are Randulf and Randolf--names that were brought to England by the Normans. Another explanation for the surname Randall, is that it is merely an apocopal form, or mediaeval vernacular form of Randolf. The Norman personal names Randulf and Randolf are ultimately derived from the Old Norse Rann√∫lfr, when the short form Randr (Old Danish Rand) is probably the first part of Norman toponyms such as Randal (Manche, le Vr√©tot, maybe from *Randdalr, a compound with dalr \\"valley\\", same as Randale, hamlet in England), Rantot (Manche, farm at Digulleville maybe from *Randtopt with topt > -tot \\"toft\\") and Ranville. In fact, Rann√∫lfr was introduced into England by Scandinavians well before the arrival of the Norman name, and because of the introduction of the form used by the Normans, both names were reinforced in England. The Old Norse Rann√∫lfr is composed of two elements--the first element is rand, meaning \\"shield\\" or \\"rim\\"; the second element is √∫lfr, meaning \\"wolf\\". The Old English form of these names is Randwulf (similarly composed of rand and wulf). Other cognates include: the Old Low German Randwulf, Randulf; and the Old Norse R√∂nd√∫lfr. There are several early occurrences in British sources of the names that gave rise to the modern given name Randall. An early occurrence of the modern surname is: Richard Randall, in 1547 (in Huntingdonshire, England). A mediaeval occurrence of the surname is: Thomas Randel, in 1250 (in Suffolk, England). An early occurrence of the short form Rand is: Rande de Borham, in 1299. An early occurrence of Randel (a diminutive of Rand) is: Randal, in 1204 (in Yorkshire, England). An early occurrence of the mediaeval personal names Randolf, Randulf is: Randulfus, in about 1095 (in the Assize Rolls of Yorkshire, England); another is: Nicolaus filius Randulphi, in the years spanning 1175-86 (in Norfolk, England). According to etymologist P. H. Reaney, the mediaeval name Randulf was commonly confused with Old German Rannulf. This Old German name is composed of elements meaning \\"raven\\" and \\"wolf\\", and was introduced into England around the same time as Randulf. One example where the unrelated names were confused and given to the same individual in different records is: Randolphus de Brachenberch, in about 1155; and Ranulfus de Brachinberge, in 1160-6 (both names recorded in Lincolnshire, England). Variant forms and pet forms Variant spellings of the given name Randall include: Randal, Randel, Randell, Randle, and Rendell. which cited: Randal is also used as an Anglicised form of the Irish and Scottish Gaelic Raghnall (to which it is etymologically unrelated). Although Randal is generally Gaelicised as Raghnall in Ireland (and sometimes R√°ghnall),; see also: the Irish Rannulbh more accurately represents Randulph and Randulf. which is a transcription of: which is a transcription of: A pet form of Randall is Randy; this name is , which cited: and is also a pet form of several other etymologically related, and unrelated names. Use and popularity \\"Lord Randal\\", by Arthur Rackham, from Some British ballads (published in about 1919). The given name Randal has been associated with this border ballad. In Scotland, the name Randal has been associated with Lord Randal, an Anglo-Scottish border ballad, published by American Francis James Child in 1882 (see Child Ballads). In parts of Ireland in the 19th and early 20th century, the name Randal has been noted being used particularly by families of the surname MacDonnell (the surname was/is spelt variously). There are several notable Irish families, historically unrelated to each other, who bear (forms of) this surname. The chiefly line of one such family relocated to the Glens of Antrim from Scotland in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Randal appears numerous times in their pedigree; this family descends from members of the Scottish Clan Donald; and even today, various Anglicised forms of the Gaelic Raghnall are commonly used by members of this clan. Randal was noted in the early 20th century as being common within the O'Donovan family as well; their name, like that of Clan Donald, originated as an Anglicised form of the etymologically unrelated Raghnall. Since 1906, Randall has been among the top 1,000 names recorded in Social Security card applications for baby boys in the United States. The name was at its most popular point in 1955, when it was ranked the 53rd most popular masculine baby name. Currently, the name was ranked 749th for the year 2009. Randall currently is, and historically has been more popular in the United States than the various other forms of the name. For example, since 1995, Randal has not been among the top 1,000 names recorded in for baby boys. This name first ranked within the top 1,000 boys names in 1938, and it stayed among the top 1,000 names until 1994; the name was at its most popular point in 1958, when it was ranked 189th. According to data released by the Social Security Administration, the forms Randell, Randel, and Randle have never been nearly as popular (see 'popularity graphs' below). In 1990, the United States Census Bureau undertook a study of the 1990 United States Census, and released a sample of data concerning the most popular names. According to this sample of 6.3 million people (who had 5,494 unique first names), Randal was ranked as the 477th most popular masculine name, and Randall was ranked 139th most popular. Neither name ranked among females in this sample. Neither Randal or Randall ranked within the top 100 masculine (or feminine) baby names for the year 2009 in England and Wales; similarly so for Scotland. In both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, neither name ranked within the top 100 masculine (or feminine) names of registered births in 2009.

When the Hindus of Salem insisted upon their right to continue their procession through the mosque, riots followed.  Events  Full-scale riots erupted in August 1882.

Agnes Tyrrell Life Agnes Tyrrell was born in Brno, the regional capital of Moravia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She was the daughter of English teacher Henry Foster Tyrrell, who had established himself among the German-speaking community of Brno, and his Czech wife Josef√≠na Kotul√°nov√°.Sadie & Samuel, 1994, p. 464Women in Czech Music at kapralova.org Agnes Tyrrell grew up in this environment speaking fluently English and German but also Czech. A child prodigy, she performed in her first piano recital at nine, and attended the Vienna Conservatory at sixteen. She studied piano with Adalbert Pacher in Vienna and composition with Anton Bruckner's teacher Otto Kitzler in Brno. She had to give up an active career as a pianist due to failing health, and devoted her short life to composition.Sadie & Samuel, 1994, p. 464. Oeuvre Tyrrell was a prolific composer. During her fairly short life (she was 36 when she died), she composed 39 compositions for piano solo, 55 vocal compositions ranging from songs to choral music, oratorio and opera, and several major orchestral works. Tyrrell was one of the few women to compose a symphony before 1900. In 2018, her Overture in C Minor received a world premiere performance by the Orchester L'anima giusta conducted by Jessica Horsley at the Frauenkomponiert Festival in Bern and recorded by Swiss Radio. It is the only known recording of Tyrrell's orchestral music.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LmMlqgYw1I& Many of Tyrrell's autograph scores are held in the Moravian Museum of Brno, some of her songs and song-cycles in Berlin's State Library.https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/search?View=rism&View;=rism&author;=agnes%20tyrell& RISM Catalogue.

At the end of the Second World War he joined Barnsley of the Football League Second Division where he was to remain for the next six years, making over 150 appearances. Kelly made his solitary international appearance in a World Cup qualifier against Scotland on 1 October 1949; another international d√©butante in that match was his Barnsley team-mate, Danny Blanchflower. With just over half an hour played, the Scots were five goals up and although the Irish managed to score twice in the second half (through Sammy Smyth), the final score was 8‚Äì2 to Scotland. Kelly was never selected for Northern Ireland again, with his namesake, Hugh Kelly of Fulham replacing him, only to concede nine goals against England in the next match. Kelly was released by Barnsley in February 1952, and dropped into Division Three (North) with Crewe Alexandra. He stayed for a little over a season at Gresty Road before retiring from professional football.

The series is hosted by New Zealand entertainer Ben Boyce, former co-host of Pulp Sport. Ben Boyce is looking for a new job. However, rather than looking for a boring, everyday desk job, he looks for one that is cool and exciting, like a rock star, millionaire, or fashion icon.About The Show - WANNA-BEn Format Each episode of ‚ÄúWANNA BEn‚Äù sees Ben interview different international celebrities that are at the top of his new chosen career path, turning the spotlight on the celebrities achievements and the various steps they‚Äôve taken on their road to success. Back home in New Zealand, armed with the sage words of his celebrity mentor, Ben then attempts to emulate their road to success in his own misguided fashion. Ultimately Ben discovers that his road to a new career and attempting to emulate his new idol is full of pain and embarrassment. Wanna-Ben's animated segments and titles are by Auckland-based animation studio Mukpuddy Animation whose credits include Sparkle Friends for TV2's What Now and Lanky Lampton: A Silly Idea for TV2's Studio 2 LIVE. Mukpuddy Animation is made up of Ryan Cooper, Tim Evans and Alex Leighton. Wanna-Ben was directed by Andy Robinson, who also worked with Ben on sports comedy television show Pulp Sport. Each episode features a mix of reality and scripted comedy and features many TV styles - interviews, skits, songs, animation and experiments with the public . Series 1 At the start of each episode a scene was played out with Ben sitting at home watching TV and his mother (played by Ginette McDonald) would tell Ben he needs to get off the couch and find a job. Ben would find an ambitious job listing such as a Rock star or Movie star, Ben would then begin his quest to be that person. The episode would then cut between Ben performing various skits often on the unsuspecting public in a similar fashion to the skits seen on Pulp Sport. Ben would then travel to Hollywood to interview a celebrity relating to Ben's chosen career. Series 1 of WANNA BEn celebrity interviews included, Action Movie Star - Steven Seagal, Spice Girl - Mel B, Pop sensation - Ke$ha, Rock legends - Alice Cooper and Bon Jovi‚Äôs Richie Sambora, Hustler founder - Larry Flynt, Hip Hop stars Flava Flav and Vanilla Ice, The Nanny - Fran Drescher and skateboarding legend - Tony Hawk. Specials In 2011, two one off specials of WANNA-BEn broadcast on TV3 based around key events in New Zealand - the Rugby World Cup and the General Election. Series 2 Series 2 saw a slight change in the format of the show. Each episode would begin with Ben interviewing the celebrity and Ben saying how he wanted to be the person he was interviewing. Ben would then begin his quest back in New Zealand to become that person, following a humiliating scene Ben would then say to the audience that they are probably wondering what made him want to be .... The show would then cut to a flashback scene played out by Ben and his flatmate who happened to be a different New Zealand celebrity each week. The scene played out would show how Ben wanted to be the person he was interviewing. Series 2 of Wanna-Ben screened in early 2012 and featured interviews with TV presenter Jerry Springer, Rock star Bret Michaels, Wrestler Hulk Hogan, Actors Henry Winkler and Gary Busey, Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas, Boxer George Foreman, Environmental activist Erin Brockovich and comedic singer Weird Al Yankovic. In 2011, before filming began on Series 2, Boyce shaved off his trademark dreadlocks to raise money for those affected by the Christchurch earthquake. On 17 September 2011, the filming of a skit for the second season caused a large-scale security scare at Auckland Airport. An actor dressed as a pilot tried to access airside at the domestic terminal though one of the gates, saying he left his security pass on the plane. Six people, including Ben Boyce, were subsequently arrested for breaching the Civil Aviation Act. Reception TV reviewer Chris Philpott of stuff.co.nz said \\"there's a lot to like about the show\\" and it \\"benefits from the comedy style of related show Pulp Sport\\". He also complimented \\"Ben's fearless interviewing\\". Some week's later he also said Wanna-Ben was part of the \\"best night of TV\\" on any channel. Chris Philpott said of Series 2 that WANNA-BEn \\"is much more refined than the first season, much funnier overall and not settling for the easy joke\\" TV reviewer Paul Casserly of nzherald.co.nz said during Series 2 that the show was \\"one of the fastest-paced shows in the history of New Zealand TV\\". He also stated \\"when he's not being arrested for trying to breach airport security, Ben rounds up celebrities for some jolly japes. Much of it is puerile, which makes it perfect for this timeslot\\" Wanna- Ben was nominated for Best Comedy in the 2011 TV Guide Best on the Box Awards. The show has also been picked up by Network Ten and Fuel TV in Australia and is set to play sometime in 2012.

It honours Our Lady of Luxembourg, Maria Mutter Jesu, Consolatrix Afflictorum, Patrona Civitatis et Patriae Luxemburgensis. History The political, social and religious environment at the beginning of the Octave was characterised by the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) and the years of the Plague (1626-1636): two thirds of the population died of the latter. This time of crisis was marked by war and famine. At the same time, the Jesuit mission had a clear goal: through an attractive popular religiousness, the Catholic faith should be strengthened in the spirit of the Counter-Reformation of the Council of Trent (1545-1563), to prevent the spread of Protestantism. * 1 October 1603: The Jesuite college was founded in Luxembourg city * 1613-1621: The Jesuit church was built (Notre-Dame Cathedral since 1870) * 8 December 1624: Students from the Jesuit college carried a wooden, 73 cm high statue of the Virgin Mary in front of the city walls on the Glacis. Father Jacques Brocquart S.J. was the initiator of this pilgrimage, and gave the statue the title of Consolatrix Afflictorum (Comforter of the Afflicted) * 1625-1628: The pilgrim's chapel was built on the Glacis, to be enlarged in 1640, and reconsecrated in 1642 * 10 May 1666: Mary, Mother of Jesus, Comforter of the Afflicted, was elected the patroness of the city of Luxembourg * 20 February 1678: The Comforter of the Afflicted was elected patroness of the Duchy of Luxembourg and of the County of Chiny * 1766: First centenary: The cast-iron votive altar from the smithy of Orval Abbey was a gift from the people to their patroness * 1778: The Jesuit church became the parish church, after the Jesuit order was dissolved by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, and the old parish church (St. Nicholas' church) had become decrepit * 1796: The pilgrims' chapel on the Glacis was destroyed by French Revolutionary troops. Since then the statue has been in the cathedral. * 1866: For the second centenary, the statue was ceremonially crowned with permission of Pope Pius IX * 1870: Luxembourg became a bishopric, and the old Jesuit church became the cathedral * 1921: Bishop Pierre Nommesch decided to make up for the 250th anniversary of the election of the patroness with a peace and anniversary Octave, since the celebrations had not taken place in 1916 due to World War I (and because Bishop Jean Joseph Koppes had been gravely ill). He also doubled the length of the Octave, as one week was no longer enough to accommodate all parishes and associations. * 1978: For the third centenary of the election as patroness of the country, the Fondation du Tricentenaire was founded. Election of Mary as patroness The text of the election act of Mary as patroness of the country on 20 February 1678 was as follows: Sainte Marie mere de JESUS Consolatrice des affliges, nous les trois Estats du Pays D√ªche de Luxembourg et Comte de Chiny avec tous les habitans du Pays Vous choisisons aujourdhuy e mes nom et celuy de nos successeurs pour dame et patrone perpetuele de toute la Province, et professions fermement de vous honorer toujours pour tele. Cepourquoy nous vous supplions tres humblement de nous recevoir en vostre protection et de nous assister au temps de guerre, peste et famine et en toutes nos necessites et duersites. Amen Translation: \\"Holy Mary, mother of Jesus, Comforter of the afflicted, we the three Estates of the Country Duchy of Luxembourg and County of Chiny with all the inhabitants of the Country choose You in our names and those of our successors, as lady and patroness perpetual of all the Province, and profess firmly to honour always. That is why we beg you very humbly to take us into your protection and to assist us in time of war, pestilence and famine and in all our needs and varieties. Amen.\\" The text was signed in the Jesuit church by the three estates (clergy, nobility and citizens of the towns), and by the magistrates of the 15 cities and the three \\"Franchises\\" of the Duchy of Luxembourg. Thus the Virgin Mary Octave took on a national character. In World War II, it also took on a patriotic meaning, and to this day belongs to the religious identity of Luxembourg.

It occurs when water droplets from the fog adhere to the needles or leaves of trees or other objects, coalesce into larger drops and then drop to the ground. Fog drip can be an important source of moisture in areas of low rainfall, or in areas that are seasonally dry. Fog drip studies in the United States * On the leeward slopes of Maui, the original dryland cloud forests were destroyed during the 19th century but historically were inhabited by native Hawaiians, so there must have been water sources. Isotopic (Oxygen-18) analyses of one of the few remaining areas of native forest, at elevation in the fog belt, found that fog drip was a major component of stream flow and shallow ground water at higher altitudes in the watershed. * On arid Santa Cruz Island, a study of the southernmost Bishop pine (Pinus muricata) forest in California found that summer cloud shading and fog drip mitigate the effects of summer drought. Even though fog cover in summer only occurs 15% of the day, this minor amount of fog enabled trees and soil microbes to grow at an increased rate. However, winter rainfall was the primary driver of summer tree growth, which is only aided by reduced soil evaporation in summer due to fog drip. Cloud cover and fog drip have enabled this relict pine forest to persist from prehistoric times when the climate was wetter. * In the Bull Run River, Oregon, fog drip from mature Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest adds of moisture per year, a 41% increase over that from rain and snow, and importantly, of all moisture in the dry May to September season. * In California Coast Ranges, a single Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) can \\"douse the ground beneath it with the equivalent of a drenching rainstorm and the drops off redwoods can provide as much as half the moisture coming into a forest over a year\\". Dawson reported that in a study of northern California redwood forests, 34% of annual hydrologic input was from fog drip. In areas were trees had been cut down, the average annual input from fog was only 17%, proving that the redwoods were required for the fog moisture input to the ecosystem. In an Occidental, California study beneath a single Douglas fir on a ridge dividing the moister western slope of the California Coast Range from the drier eastern slope, moisture collected under the tree averaged versus in an adjacent open meadow. On Inverness Ridge in Point Reyes National Seashore fog drip from Douglas firs in summer may add to the otherwise of annual average rainfall. Further south, on Cahill Ridge on the San Francisco Peninsula (between Pilarcitos Creek and Crystal Springs Reservoir) at an altitude of , Oberlander measured fog drip beneath Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), Coast redwood and three Douglas fir trees, the latter tall. He found that the trees most exposed produced the most moisture and in five weeks of measurement (July 20‚ÄìAugust 28, 1951) fog drip below the tanoak produced of moisture, more than the total annual precipitation on nearby grasslands and chaparral. The Douglas fir produced of fog drip and appeared to provide unique conditions supporting the orchids Giant helleborine (Epipactis gigantea) and Phantom orchid (Cephalanthera austiniae), since these plants were found exclusively in these moist ridge tops. * In the Green Mountains of northern Vermont at elevations above in the spruce‚Äìfir zone on the western slope of Camel's Hump, fog drip increased the total moisture available up to 67% over rainfall alone. The authors concluded that the needlelike leaves and twiggy character of the conifers in the spruce‚Äìfir zone serve as effective mechanical collectors of the wind-driven cloud droplets. Fog drip areas outside the United States * One of the few areas in the world where people climb to the hilltops to get water in times of drought is the Downs in England, where fog blows in from the English Channel to form what locals call \\"dew ponds\\", although they are in fact formed by fog drip instead of dew. * Near the Pacific coast of Peru and northern Chile, in the nearly complete absence of any annual rainfall, fog drip allows vegetation, including trees, to grow, called \\"Lomas\\". * In the arid climate of northern Kenya, fog drip may be an important source of infiltration and groundwater recharge, where isotopic analysis found the latter to be a mixture of rainwater and fog drip. * In the Pacific Ocean off Mexico, Cedros and Guadalupe Islands support Monterey pine forests. Very sparse rainfall augmented by fog trip permits the existence of the forests.Oberbauer, Thomas A.

Between January 1889 and February 1902 she took part in 49 Sunday Evening Concerts at South Place, later joining the Society. She was known too for her financial largesse giving generously to societies in both the UK and America.

Rowntree was born in London in 1912 and held a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering... He worked as an engineering consultant for Alcott & Lomax, who would be acquired by Babtie in 2000. During his consulting career he was involved with the construction of water pumping stations.. Rowntree was appointed director of the Water Resources Board (WRB), a national water planning body established in 1964.. The WRB was dominated by civil engineers and focussed its efforts on implementing structural solutions to water resource problems. Rowntree was a keen proponent of that school of thought, saying in 1962 that \\"the solution of water supply problems ‚Ä¶ will require the construction and operation of large works and highly‚Äêdeveloped technical control\\". Under Rowntree's leadership the WRB was able to undertake what was the largest scheme of water planning yet seen in England and Wales. Rowntree was made a Knight Bachelor in Elizabeth II's 1970 Birthday Honours. Rowntree gave the Institution of Electrical Engineers 1972 Graham Clark Lecture on \\"Conservation and use of water resources\\" and the same year wrote an article for the Proceedings of the Royal Society B entitled \\"Water Resources Management in England and Wales\\".. By 1974, he had become a Professor and, on 2 December that year, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by City University London. Rowntree was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) for the November 1975‚Äì76 session. He used his inaugural presidential address to emphasise that \\"the duty remains with engineers and other experts to minimise the range of intangible issues‚Ä¶ the inaccuracy of words and the opportunities of distortion are enormous. In the present age of unreason this is a real danger and may be responsible for many of our present ills\\". He was a chartered engineer and a fellow of the institution.

Early life Preston Hall, Kent Culpeper was the son of Sir Richard Culpeper, 2nd Baronet of Preston Hall, and his wife Margaret Reynolds. He inherited the baronetcy and Preston Hall in infancy on the death of his father on 10 January 1660. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford on 15 June 1672 aged 15.Culpeper Archives - Oxford Alumni He took as his mistress Lady Elizabeth Wythens, the wife of Sir Francis Wythens, of Southend, Eltham, Kent which led to great acrimony. In 1693 Lady Wythens tried to have her husband incarcerated in a debtors‚Äô prison. In November 1696 Wythens raised a charge of assault against Culpeper and Sir Thomas Taylor, 2nd Baronet, Lady Wythens' brother, but failed to gain a conviction when several worthies testified to Culpeper's ‚Äògreat worth and honour‚Äô. After Wythens‚Äô death on 9 May 1704, Culpeper married his widow on 23 August 1704, but it was reported that he never lived with her as a husband. Career Culpeper was High Sheriff of Kent in 1704. At the 1705 English general election he was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidstone, Kent. He voted for the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705, but, probably in support of the Country Whigs, he voted against the Court on the ‚Äòplace clause‚Äô of the regency bill, on 18 February 1706. He was returned as a Whig again at the 1708 British general election and he voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and the for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. At the 1710 British general election, he topped the poll, but is not recorded in any divisions in that Parliament. He decided not to stand at the 1713 British general election. At the 1715 British general election, Culpeper was returned again as MP for Maidstone. He voted for the septennial bill in 1716, and against the Peerage Bill. He was returned again at the 1722 British general election. Death and legacy Culpeper died without issue on 18 May 1723 at the age of 66 and the baronetcy became extinct. His estates passed to his sister Alicia's son, Sir Thomas Taylor, 3rd Baronet. He also left 500 guineas to Lady Catharine Twisden, born Wythens, who may have been Culpeper's natural daughter, and 100 guineas to mistress Swayne, ‚Äòher woman‚Äô, for faithful service.

The term 'coalition' means a coming together of two or more entities to merge into one mass.English Language Dictionary, 2007 The tissue connecting the bones, often referred to as a \\"bar\\", may be composed of fibrous or osseous tissue. The two most common types of tarsal coalitions are calcaneo-navicular (calcaneonavicular bar) and talo-calcaneal (talocalcaneal bar), comprising 90% of all tarsal coalitions.LearningRadiology.com There are other bone coalition combinations possible, but they are very rare.Tarsal coalition and painful flatfoot, K.A. Vincent, Shriners Hospital for Children, Portland, Oregon and Department of Orthopedics, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR 97201-3905, USA Symptoms tend to occur in the same location, regardless of the location of coalition: on the lateral foot, just anterior and below the lateral malleolus. This area is called the sinus tarsi. Symptoms The bones of children are very malleable in infancy. This will generally mean that, despite the presence of a coalition, the bones can deform enough to allow painless walking until the child's skeleton has matured enough.Mihran O. Tachdjian, Pediatric Orthopedics, 1990 'Skeletal maturing' means that bone is laid down in the tissue that forms the immature bone shape gradually until adult bone is achieved at about the age of seventeen years in the feet. Other body parts reach skeletal maturity at different times. The onset of symptoms related to a tarsal coalition usually occurs at about nine to seventeen years of age, with a peak incidence occurring at ten to fourteen years of age.Mihran O. Tachdjian, Pediatric Orthopedics, 1990 Symptoms may start suddenly one day and persist, and can include pain (may be quite severe), lack of endurance for activity, fatigue, muscle spasms and cramps, an inability to rotate the foot, or antalgic gait. Causes Tarsal coalition is almost exclusively a product of an error during the dividing of embryonic cells in utero.Tarsal coalition and painful flatfoot, KA Vincent, Shriners Hospital for Children, Portland, Oregon and Department of Orthopedics, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR 97201-3905, USA Other causes of synostosis (bone fusion) could include a surgical 'screwing together' of two bones, a very advanced case of arthritis leading to self-fusion of a joint by an internal process within the body or some other very traumatic event. The birth defect responsible for tarsal coalition is thought to often be an autosomal dominant genetic condition.Tarsal coalition and painful flatfoot, K.A. Vincent, Shriners Hospital for Children, Portland, Oregon and Department of Orthopedics, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR 97201-3905, USA This means that if you have a parent with the disorder it is highly likely to be passed on to offspring. Anatomy Anatomically, the abnormal connecting 'bridge' is virtually all cartilage in the young child, often nearly all bone in an adult and a mixture as the skeleton ossifies in between these ages. Some fibrous tissue (like gristle) is often also involved. When the bridging link becomes bony enough, it results in a limitation of motion and this brings about the onset of pain.Mihran O. Tachdjian, Pediatric Orthopedics, 1990 The bones of the tarsus are the rear most bones in the adjacent diagram: calcaneus, talus, navicular, cuboid, medial cuneiform, intermediate cuneiform and lateral cuneiform bones.Debra Draves, Anatomy of the Lower Extremity, 1986, p 107. These bones create the two major foot joints ‚Äì the subtalar and midtarsal joints ‚Äì that allow complex motions to occur in the feet. These motions are necessary for such activities as walking over uneven terrain and creating a gait that allows normal function of the knees, hips, back, etc. Diagnosis In a case of an adolescent with rear foot pain, the physical exam will reveal that the foot movement is limited. This is both because there is a physical blockade to movement and because the brain will 'turn on' the muscles around the area to stop the joint moving toward the painful 'zone'. X-rays will usually be ordered and, in general, if there is enough toughness to the tissue bridge that pain has begun ‚Äì there will usually be enough bone laid down to show up in an x-ray.Stephanie Cosgrove: Tarsal Coalition More high-tech investigations such as CT scan will be required if proceeding to surgery. If the bridge appears to be mostly fibrous tissue, an MRI would be the preferred modality to use.Tarsal Coalition: A Patient's Guide to Tarsal Coalition. EOrthopod. Medical Multimedia Group, L.L.C. Date Unknown Treatment The goal of non-surgical treatment of tarsal coalition is to relieve the symptoms by reducing the movement of the affected joint. This might include non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroidal anti-inflammatory injection, stabilizing orthotics or immobilization via a leg cast. At times, short term immobilization followed by long term orthotic use may be sufficient to keep the area free of pain. Surgery is very commonly required. The type and complexity of the surgery will depend on the location of the coalition. Essentially, there are two types of surgery. Wherever possible, the bar will be removed to restore normal motion between the two bones. If this is not possible, it may be necessary to fuse the affected joints together by using screws to connect them solidly. Cutting away the coalition is more likely to succeed the younger the patient. With age comes extra wear in the affected and adjacent joints that makes treatment more difficult.Stephanie Cosgrove: Tarsal Coalition See also *Carpal coalition  References  Further reading  * Category:Foot diseases ","title":"Tarsal coalition"},{"id":"29213973","text":"The Training Table was a regional chain of fast food restaurants in the U.S. State of Utah.

The Training Table was family owned and operated by Kent and Stephanie Chard. It was known for its cheese fries and dipping sauce, along with several sandwich and hamburger preparations. It had locations in Layton, Sugar House, Cottonwood, South Towne and Riverton. Until the early 2010s, it also had a location on the eastern edge of downtown Salt Lake City.

Ordering The chain was unusual among fast food restaurants because of its system for ordering food. Customers sat at tables or booths, as they would in a typical fast casual restaurant. Each table or booth had an in-house telephone associated with it. When customers had decided on what they wanted to order, they would pick up the telephone, which would automatically ring to the order station in the kitchen. A staff member would answer and take the customer's order over the phone. When the order was ready, the kitchen staff would ring back to the phone at the table, which would signal the customers to go to the front so they could pay for and pick up their food. Layout Each Training Table location had a similar layout. the kitchen and register was located at the very back of the restaurant, and the eating area was relatively open. The middle of the restaurant housed booths arranged in small pit chambers, and the periphery was divided into two separate elevated areas. One elevated area mainly had a combination of 2- and 4-person tables with chairs, while the other elevated area offered 2-person tables with chairs as well as tables with mixed bench and chair seating.

It is characterized by polyhydramnios and fetal overgrowth, including macrocephaly, neonatal macrosomia, visceromegaly, dysmorphic facial features, and an increased risk for Wilms' tumor at an early age. The prognosis for Perlman syndrome is poor and it is associated with a high neonatal mortality. Perlman syndrome is an uncommon genetic disorder grouped with overgrowth syndrome in which an abnormal increase is often noted at birth in the size of the body or a body part of the infant. The disorder, also called renal hamartomas, nephroblastomatosis and fetal gigantism, has also been grouped with Renal cell carcinoma. The characteristic features include polyhydramnios, fetal overgrowth, including macrocephaly, neonatal macrosomia, visceromegaly, dysmorphic facial features, and an increased risk for Wilms' tumor at an early age.  Genetics  The gene thought to cause some of the cases of Perlman syndrome is DIS3L2 found on chromosome 2 at 2q37.2 and is thought to have an important role in the mitotic cell cycle. Although both sexes are affected, the sex ratio of male to female is 2:1. The syndrome has been described in both consanguineous and non-consanguineous couplings. No chromosomal abnormalities have been observed, except for in the case of Chernos et al., which showed a de novo mutation ‚Äî an extra G positive band, a genetic mutation that neither parent possessed nor transmitted ‚Äî on the tip of the short arm of chromosome 11. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Perlman syndrome is based on observed phenotypic features and confirmed by histological examination of the kidneys. Prenatal diagnosis is possible for families that have a genetic disposition for Perlman syndrome although there is no conclusive laboratory test to confirm the diagnosis. Fetal overgrowth, particularly with an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) greater than the 90th centile for gestational age, as well as an excess of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac (polyhydramnios), may be the first signs of Perlman. Using ultrasound diagnosis, Perlman syndrome has been detected at 18 weeks. During the first trimester, the common abnormalities of the syndrome observed by ultrasound include cystic hygroma and a thickened nuchal lucency. Common findings for the second and third trimesters include macrosomia, enlarged kidneys, renal tumors (both hamartoma and Wilms), cardiac abnormalities and visceromegaly. Prompt recognition and identification of the disorder along with accurate follow-up and clinical assistance is recommended as the prognosis for Perlman is severe and associated with a high neonatal death rate. Differential diagnosis Perlman syndrome shares clinical overlaps with other overgrowth disorders, with similarities to Beckwith‚ÄìWiedemann syndrome and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome having been particularly emphasized in scientific study. Similarities with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome include polyhydramnios, macrosomia, nephromegaly and hypoglycaemia. It is the distinctive facial dysmorphology of Perlman, including deep-set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, everted upper lip, and macrocephaly which allows the two conditions to be distinguished from one another. Diagnosis of Perlman syndrome also overlaps with other disorders associated with Wilms tumor, namely, Sotos syndrome and Weaver syndrome. Treatment Epidemiology  Perlman syndrome is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of less than 1 in 1,000,000. As of 2008, fewer than 30 patients had ever been reported in the world literature.

The members of the council consisted of the President of the Soviet Union, and highest officials (which typically was presidents of their republics) from the Soviet Union Republics. During the period of transition it was the highest organ of state power, having the power to elect a premier, or a person who would take Gorbachev's place if absent; the office of Vice President of the Soviet Union had been abolished following the failed August Coup that very same year.  Inter-republican Economic Committee With the central government's authority greatly weakened by the failed coup, Gorbachev established a four-man committee, led by Russian SFSR Premier Ivan Silayev, that included Grigory Yavlinsky, Arkadi Volsky, and Yuri Luzhkov, to elect a new Cabinet of Ministers. This committee was later transformed into the Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy (COMSE), also chaired by Silayev, to manage the Soviet economy.

COMSE was quickly surpassed in authority by the Inter-republican Economic Committee of the Soviet Union (IEC). Its function was to coordinate economic policy across the Soviet Union. As Chairman of both COMSE and the IEC, Silayev presided over a quickly disintegrating Soviet Union. When he first took office, Silayev wanted to reduce the powers of the central government and give more powers to the Soviet Republics. This view changed; he demanded that Yeltsin give back much of the authority of the central government which he had usurped following the August Coup. In this he failed, and his position as Russian SFSR Premier was severely weakened as a result. Oleg Lobov, Silayev's First Deputy Premier, led the anti-Silayev faction in the Russian SFSR Council of Ministers and managed to oust him on 26 September 1991; Lobov succeeded Silayev as acting Premier of the Russian SFSR. Silayev, as overseer of the economy, was given the task of initiating economic reforms in the Soviet Union in a way that suited both the central government and the Soviet republics. Silayev tried to maintain an integrated economy while initiating the marketisation of the economy. The IEC showed its international intent by signing the European Energy Charter on 16/17 December 1991 with 35 other countries, but this was undermined by the charter also being signed by nine of the twelve remaining republics.Hansard 19 December 1991 c242W Dissolution of the Soviet Union On 19 December COMSE was dissolved by a presidential Russian SFSR decree, and Gorbachev resigned as Soviet President on 25 December.

Other names include: motorbike, bike, and cycle. Motorcycling ‚Äî act of riding a motorcycle, around which a variety of subcultures and lifestyles have built up. Motorcycles=Description * Legal definition of motorcycle ‚Äì a 'powered two-wheel motor vehicle'. Most countries distinguish between mopeds up to and the more powerful, larger, vehicles known as motorcycles. Scooters do not count as a separate category, and are deemed to be \\"motorcycles\\". * Some motorcycles have paired front wheels, or paired rear wheels, three in all. Motorized tricycles and sidecar outfits are deemed \\"motorcycles\\". Most jurisdictions do not consider three-wheeled cars to be motorcycles; but some (including the UK) grant low tax and driving licence exemptions to such vehicles subject to, say, weight and power limits.\\"Daily Telegraph\\" report on new limits * Motorcycles can be described as all of the following: ** a component of transport ** a component of a mode of transport ** a component of road transport ** a type of vehicle ** a type of motor vehicle ** a type of machine ** sports equipment Types Types of motorcycles The design of a motorcycle reflects the purpose for which it is to be used. The main types of motorcycle include: A 1969 Harley-Davidson chopper, a replica of the 'Captain America' bike from Easy Rider Honda CB750 inline four, the first to be called a 'superbike', and the archetypal Universal Japanese Motorcycle 2015 BMW R1200RT Sport Touring Motorcycle *Street motorcycle ‚Äì designed for riding on paved roads; features smooth tyres with a light tread pattern and at least engine. **Cruiser ‚Äì mimics the style of American machines from the 1930s to the early 1960s, including those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, Excelsior and Henderson; models evocative of the early cruisers make up 60% of the U.S. market ***Bobber ‚Äì usually has had the front fender removed, the rear fender 'bobbed' or made smaller, and all superfluous items removed to make it lighterArt of the Bobber by Spencer Drate, Judith Salavetz, Alex Mardikian - 2006 ***Chopper ‚Äì has a longer frame design accompanied by a stretched front end (or rake). To achieve a longer front end, while the frame is being designed, the fabricator tilts the neck of the frame at less of an incline and installs a longer fork. **Sport bike ‚Äì optimised for speed, acceleration, braking, and cornering on paved roads, (\\"‚Ä¶a powerful, lightweight motorcycle, designed for optimal speed and handling\\" ) typically at the expense of comfort and fuel economy in comparison to less specialised motorcycles. ***Caf√© racer ‚Äì a type of motorcycle that has been modified for speed and good handling rather than comfort. Cafe racers' bodywork and control layout typically mimic the style of Grand Prix roadracers of the 1950s or 1960s with or without fairings. They tend to feature an elongated fuel tank, a small, rearward mounted and humped single seat, and low, race style handlebars mounted on the front forks. ***Streetfighter ‚Äì a sport bike that is customised by removing the fairing, with other changes that result in an overall more aggressive look **Touring motorcycle ‚Äì designed for long-distance touring and heavy commuting; although any motorcycle can be ridden to tour or commute, manufacturers provide specific models designed to address these particular needs ***Sport touring motorcycle ‚Äì blends performance with long-distance capabilities while providing comfort and relative safety to the rider, and tend to include accessories, such as a trunk or saddlebags for storage, to enhance the touring experience **Standard motorcycle ‚Äì versatile, general purpose street motorcycle, with an upright riding position. ***Universal Japanese Motorcycle ‚Äì Japanese motorcycle with a transverse air-cooled four-cylinder engine in a conventional tube frame with a dual seat, mostly made in the 1970s and early 1980s *Custom motorcycle ‚Äì unique or individually produced in a very limited quantity, as opposed to stock bikes which are mass-produced. Is usually highly stylised or has an unusual frame geometry or engine design. Many styles including caf√© racer, streetfighter, and chopper began as customized motorcycles before manufacturers mass-produced bikes styled after popular custom machines. **Rat bike ‚Äì motorcycle maintained at little to no cost, or often of a deliberately exaggerated state of disrepair *Dual-sport motorcycle ‚Äì type of street-legal motorcycle designed for both on and off-road use **Enduro motorcycle ‚Äì motorcycle made specifically for the Enduro sport, with the long travel and medium-hard suspension of a motocross bike enhanced with motorcycle features such as a headlight and quiet muffler to make the bike street-legal for parts of the track **Motocross motorcycle ‚Äì a light weight, high power, off-road competition race bike **Supermoto motorcycle ‚Äì a dual purpose, single cylinder, light weight bike fitted with equipment better suited to street riding or racing such as 18 inch front wheel and road tyres *Off-road motorcycle **Motocross motorcycle **Track racing motorcycle ‚Äì customised for track racing, with no brakes and fueled with methanol **Trials motorcycle ‚Äì an extremely lightweight design, that lacks seating (designed to be ridden standing up) and that has suspension travel that is short, relative to a motocross or enduro motorcycle Honda Super Cub, the archetypal underbone and the world's best-selling motor vehicle *Small class **Minibike ‚Äì sometimes called a mini-moto or pocket-bike, it is a considerably smaller motorcycle; most traditional minibikes use a two stroke engine to turn the rear wheel via a chain **Mini chopper ‚Äì mini choppers are scaled-down versions of choppers, and are usually constructed from 1\\" steel tubing or 3/4\\" steel black pipe; the tube or pipe is bent and then welded together to get the desired angles and shapes of the frame, which is usually custom made **Moped ‚Äì a type of low- powered motorcycle designed to provide economical and relatively safe transport with minimal licensing requirements ***Sport moped ‚Äì a type of moped that resembles a sport bike **Pit bike ‚Äì a small off-road motorcycle originally used for riding around the pits or staging area of a motocross race; since the early 2000s, pit bike racing, a sport similar to motocross, has become popular in the United States, especially in Southern California **Scooter ‚Äì a step-through motorcycle with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels. Most modern scooter designs have swingarm-mounted engines **Underbone ‚Äì a step-through motorcycle with a structural down-tube and conventionally sized wheels, but without a floorboard *Electric motorcycle ‚Äì has an electric motor powered by one or more batteries or fuel cells **Electric dragbike **TTXGP race class **TT Zero race class *Enclosed motorcycle **Cabin motorcycle **Streamliner motorcycle *Utility motorcycle **Derny ‚Äì motorised bicycle for motor-paced cycling events **Blood bike **Fire bike **Motocrotte ‚Äì Parisian sanitation motorcycle **Motorcycle ambulance **Motorcycle taxi **Police motorcycle *Other designs and variations **Feet forwards motorcycle ‚Äì motorcycle on which the rider reclines with his feet positioned ahead of his body *Related three-wheeled vehicles **Auto rickshaw **Motorcycle combination **Motorized tricycle **Tilting three-wheeler Design Motorcycle design *Motorcycle dynamics **Shaft effect *Motorcycle geometry *Motorcycle testing and measurement =Major component parts= Motorcycle components *Motorcycle brakes **Anti-lock braking system ‚Äì fitted to many modern motorcycles **Combined braking system ‚Äì links front and rear brake operation *Motorcycle chassis ‚Äì includes the frame and suspension, along with the front forks, of the vehicle. **Motorcycle frame ‚Äì provides the strength and rigidity of the motorcycle; all other parts are attached directly or indirectly to the frame **Suspension ‚Äì controls the ride and handling of the motorcycle by controlling the rate and distance of the movement of the wheels relative to the frame **Motorcycle fork ‚Äì acts as suspension for the front wheel and allows the motorcycle to be steered *Motorcycle engine ‚Äì provides the power to propel the motorcycle **Forced induction in motorcycles ‚Äì turbocharger or supercharger for greater power per unit displacement *Motorcycle transmission **Chain drive ‚Äì the most common method of transferring power from the engine to the wheels **Shaft drive ‚Äì low- maintenance alternative to chain drive, favoured by certain manufacturers, such as BMW Motorrad and Moto Guzzi, and also used on many large touring motorcycles **Belt drive ‚Äì low-maintenance alternative to chain drive, favoured by certain manufacturers, such as Harley-Davidson, and on many cruiser motorcycles *Motorcycle handlebar *Instrument panel **Speedometer ‚Äì indicates the forward speed of the motorcycle **Odometer ‚Äì records and indicates the total distance travelled by the motorcycle **Tachometer ‚Äì indicates the rotational speed of the crankshaft in the engine, often also shows an indicated safe limit called a redline **Fuel gauge ‚Äì indicates the amount of fuel in the tank relative to tank capacity *Motorcycle saddle *Motorcycle tyres ‚Äì have a round cross section to facilitate the leaning necessary when a motorcycle turns *Motorcycle wheels *Motorcycle accessories **Motorcycle fairing **Motorcycle headlamp modulator **Sidecar **Storage accessories ***Pannier ***Saddlebags ***Motorcycle trailer ***Trunk Models *:Category:Lists of motorcycles *:Category:British motorcycles listed by marque *List of Grand Prix motorcycles Manufacturers *List of motorcycle manufacturers History Brough Superior SS 100 1925 Motorcycle history *Motorcycle land speed record **List of fastest production motorcycles *History of electric motorcycles and scooters =Pioneers= Lucius Copeland 1894 First motorcycle ride ‚Äì it is generally accepted that the first motorcycle ride was by Gottlieb Daimler's son Paul on a new machine called Einspur ('one track') near Stuttgart in Germany on 10 November 1885.

Sport FIM Motocross World Championship, taking place at Mallory Park, England Motorcycle sport ‚Äì broad field that encompasses all sporting aspects of motorcycling. The various disciplines are not all races or timed-speed events, as several disciplines test a competitor's various riding skills. Riders have raced motorcycles for over a hundred years, with the first official competition recorded as the Paris‚ÄìRouen race in July 1894. This was quickly followed by races all over Europe and the US. In 1907, the Isle of Man TT races took over of the island's roads and has continued since. Motorcycle sport now takes many different forms, including: *Enduro *Freestyle Motocross *Land speed record ‚Äì a single rider accelerates over a 1- to 3-mile (4.8 km) long straight track (usually on dry lake beds) and is timed for top speed through a trap at the end of the run. The rider must exceed the previous top speed record for that class or type of bike for their name to be placed on the record books. **Motorcycle land speed record *Motoball (Motorcycle Polo) ‚Äì similar to football, but all players (except goalkeepers) ride motorcycles, and the ball is much bigger. *Motorcycle trials *Motorcycle stunt riding **Wheelie **Stoppie **Burnout *:Category:Motorcycle sport lists =Racing= Motorcycle racing ‚Äì motorcycle sport involving racing motorcycles, on or off a track. *Motorcycle drag racing **Pro Stock Motorcycle *Road racing **Grand Prix motorcycle racing **Superbike racing **Isle of Man TT **TTXGP **North West 200 **Ulster Grand Prix *Motocross **Motocross World Championship **Motocross des Nations **AMA Motocross Championship **Trans-AMA Motocross Championship **AMA Supercross Championship *Pit bike racing ‚Äì competition sport similar to motocross, using pit bikes *Track racing **Motorcycle speedway **Speedway Grand Prix **Speedway World Cup **SGB Premiership **AMA Grand National Championship **Grasstrack **Ice speedway *Enduro **World Enduro Championship **International Six Days Enduro **Grand National Cross Country **Erzberg Rodeo **Red Bull Romaniacs Hard Enduro Rallye **Endurocross *Motorcycle trials **FIM Trial World Championship Organisations and clubs Although motorcycling can be a solitary form of transport, there are clubs for almost every aspect; including charities, social clubs, criminal or outlaw clubs, lobby groups that guard against restrictive legislation, and specialist clubs for specific makes or types of motorcycle.

Todd played 25 tests for New Zealand internationally, from his debut in 2013, until his last test, during the 2019 Rugby World Cup. He scored three tries for New Zealand and also became the first overseas-based player to represent the All Blacks, in 2018, when he first signed for Panasonic. Todd began his professional rugby union career, through representing Canterbury in the ITM Cup, from 2009 to 2017, going on to play more than 150 games for the Crusaders in Super Rugby. Early life Todd's started playing rugby at the Kaiapoi Rugby Football Union and went on to play for the Kaiapoi High School first XV. He then took the opportunity of a full scholarship at CBHS. While at Christchurch Boys' High School, Todd appeared alongside future All Black team-mates, Colin Slade and Owen Franks, as well as former Crusader Nasi Manu and current Crusader Tim Bateman. Playing career=Early career In 2009 made his Air New Zealand Cup debut as a replacement against Waikato at AMI Stadium. He made his first start against Taranaki a week later in the second Shield challenge of the season. In the 2010 NPC season, with teammate Richie McCaw being busy with the All Blacks, he had a chance to start in all of Canterbury's games. His versatility in being able to play blindside and openside flanker has helped Canterbury to win the Ranfurly Shield. Following an early season injury to McCaw, Todd was selected to play for the Crusaders 2011 season. Todd had previously been in the Crusaders' wider training group in 2010. Todd's presence in the Crusaders saw Richie McCaw switch jerseys, from 7 to 6, with Head Coach Todd Blackadder choosing to field two openside flankers, in order to make Todd a regular starter for the team. 2013-2017 In 2013, Todd played outstandingly in the absence of Richie McCaw, who was on sabbatical. Todd was subsequently selected for the All Blacks by Head Coach Steve Hansen. Todd made his international debut for them during a 24-9 victory over France on 22 June 2013, replacing fellow rookie Sam Cane off the bench in the 72nd minute. Todd was also used off the bench against South Africa that year. After missing international rugby in 2014, Todd played against Samoa in Apia, in 2015, replacing veteran Jerome Kaino the bench for a one-off test match, which the All Blacks won, 25-16. After missing the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Todd was re- selected for New Zealand in the 2016 Rugby Championship following a leg injury to Sam Cane. Todd earned the first two starts of his international career in the series, against South Africa and Australia, where New Zealand retained the Bledisloe Cup. He was notably named Man of the Match in the final Bledisloe Cup Test, before being replaced by Ardie Savea in the 65th minute, as the All Blacks beat Australia 37-10. Todd's outstanding performance against Australia saw him taken on the 2016 end-of-year tour, where he played in a further two tests. Todd's standout 2016 season saw him named as one of two vice-captains for the Crusaders in 2017 alongside Ryan Crotty, with lock Sam Whitelock named as captain. Todd played the full 80 minutes against the touring British and Irish Lions side for the Crusaders on 10 June. The Crusaders lost 3-12. Despite performing well in his Super Rugby campaign which included a start in the 25-17 Grand Final win over the Lions, Todd was not selected for the All Blacks' Lions series squad or the initial squad for the 2017 Rugby Championship. After Jerome Kaino paused his training with the All Blacks due to personal reasons and went to represent Auckland in the Mitre 10 Cup, Todd was re-selected and started against Argentina in a scrappy 36-10 win where he received the first yellow card of his test career and was replaced by Ardie Savea in the 65th minute. Todd made four more appearances for the All Blacks in 2017, including three on the bench as a replacement for Sam Cane on the end-of-year tour. 2018 Todd captained the Crusaders numerous times during the 2018 Super Rugby season, with Ryan Crotty and Sam Whitelock suffering multiple concussions each through the season. Todd was later chosen as Crusaders' Player of the Season by his team-mates as the team beat the Lions, in the Super Rugby final, for the second year in a row. The Crusaders won against the Lions by 37-18 and claimed their ninth Super Rugby title. Although Todd was performing very well in comparison to Ardie Savea, who was struggling with injury, during Super Rugby, Savea was again chosen over Todd for the All Blacks' mid-year test series, which was against France. Todd was again called into the All Blacks, however, with Sam Cane struggling in regards to discipline, while Liam Squire and Vaea Fifita were struggling with injuries. Todd was named on the bench for the third test of the Steinlager series, on 23 June 2018. Todd replaced the injured Savea only 17 minutes into the test, scoring his first international try only minutes later. Todd starred against France as the All Blacks won 49-14. After the conclusion of Super Rugby, Todd signed a high-profile one-season deal with Japan-based club, the Panasonic Wild Knights. Todd missed the 2018 Rugby Championship with his commitments to the Wild Knights, but was called in for the injured Sam Cane for 2018 the end-of-year tour. Todd subsequently became the first overseas- based All Black upon his re-selection. Todd played three tests off the bench during the end-of-year tour, replacing Ardie Savea in all of them. Todd unfortunately did not manage to make much of an impact towards New Zealand's 9-16 loss to Ireland, only playing for four minutes during the test. 2019 Todd returned to the Crusaders for the 2019 Super Rugby season, his final season in New Zealand, which saw him Captain the team occasionally throughout the season. The Crusaders went on to win the competition for the third year in a row, sending Todd off on a high. With Liam Squire opting out of consideration for All Black selection, Todd went on to start against South Africa in the 2019 Rugby Championship, also appearing as a substitute against Australia in the first Bledisloe Cup test of the year, which was a 26-47 loss, New Zealand's heaviest defeat of all time. All Blacks Head Coach, Steve Hansen named Todd in New Zealand's 31-man squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup on 28 August 2019. Having narrowly missed selection in 2015, this was to be Todd's first World Cup. Todd played in two tests during the World Cup's pool stages, including a start in a 63-0 victory over Canada. Todd was later named as a replacement for the quarter-final, against Ireland, scoring a try in the 46-14 victory, although he did receive a yellow card with three minutes left. Although Todd was ruled out of the semi-final loss to England through injury, he played his last test for New Zealand on 1 November 2019, replacing Shannon Frizell, with 20 minutes left of the 40-17 win against Wales, during the World Cup's Bronze Final. Todd was one of five players to finish his international career for New Zealand that day, with Sonny Bill Williams, Ben Smith and Todd's Crusaders teammates, Ryan Crotty and Captain Kieran Read, all retiring that day, alongside Todd.

She made her fortune as the founder of the Kathmandu clothing and outdoor equipment company. She currently lives in Bicheno, Tasmania. She runs various companies and business interests, which together span Britain, New Zealand and Australia. She is a philanthropist and supporter of animal welfare. In 2006, Cameron sold 51% of her share of Kathmandu for A$247 million, making her the fourth-richest woman in Australia. It was reported in September 2013 she had lost almost 90% of her fortune in the collapse of her company Retail Adventures, which entered receivership earlier that year. Companies Cameron was the sole shareholder of Retail Adventures, when it was placed into receivership in 2012 with debts to unsecured creditors of $165 million. In early 2013 she successfully bid to buy the company out of receivership for $58.9 million. Bentham IMF litigation funders gave notice in March 2013 of a possible class action lawsuit and is seeking a public examination of whether the company traded insolvent prior to receivership. Bentham IMF also raised questions about \\"director related payments\\" shortly before the company went into administration and the status of secured debts owed by Retail Adventures to entities related to Cameron. Their case and following appeal was dismissed. On 3 July 2014, it was reported mediation between her and liquidators of Retail Adventures, Deloitte, had broken down and the firm would be pursuing a public examination of the conditions surrounding the collapse of Retail Adventures, including alleged insolvent trading. She also owns stakes in several other major retail companies; she owns 9% of Pumpkin Patch, 58% of Macpac, and 19% of the Postie Plus Group. In 2008 she purchased the Arbuckles manchester chain off struggling Postie Plus for an undisclosed sum in June 2008, later liquidating the business in August that year so she could use the locations to open her Dog's Breakfast furniture company. Dog's Breakfast was shut down in 2010, with some stores converted to NOOD (New Objects of Desire), also a furniture retail company owned by Cameron, some to Chickenfeed stores‚Äîwhich itself later shut down‚Äîand some not replaced. It was reported in June 2014 Jan Cameron was the major backer of baby-food company Bellamy's Organic, which will begin its IPO on the ASX in July, estimated to be worth $100 million. In 2016 Cameron placed a $280 million bid for Australia's oldest and largest dairy, Van Diemen's Land Company dairy. Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison, citing \\"national interest\\", instead sold the dairy to Moon Lake Investments, a Chinese company. Another failed bidder for the dairy, TasFoods, was awarded $1.25 million in damages from Van Diemen's Land Company for breach of contract in regards to the sale. Cameron later stated that Morrison had \\"betrayed the future of Australians\\" as the sale was the latest during a public debate over foreign ownership of Australia's most fertile land. Kathmandu Cameron founded the Kathmandu adventure wear company alongside John Pawson in 1987 after selling Alp Sports, her first company. She started in the early 1970s by sewing sleeping bags to sell in Alp Sports, before she and her ex-husband bought half of Kathmandu and changed to selling Chinese-produced products. In 1991 Kathmandu brought back Alp Sports, therefore expanding Kathmandu into New Zealand, and then in 1994 John Pawson was bought out by Cameron and her ex-husband Bernard Wicht, leaving Wicht and Cameron as the sole owners of Kathmandu. Two years later in 1996, Cameron bought out her ex-husband's share of Kathmandu. In 2006 she sold 51% of her share in Kathmandu to a private equity firm for A$247 million, and several months later she sold her remaining 49% of the company. Philanthropy Cameron is a philanthropist and supporter of animal welfare and various charities. In 2010 she founded the Animal Justice Fund, donating five million dollars to start the organisation, which states its mission as \\"to promote the cause of animal welfare through strategic litigation, public awareness campaigns and the prosecution of persons or businesses who commit offences against animals used in intensive farming or through commercial and/or recreational practices.\\" The following year, in May 2011, Cameron donated 60 acres on the Freycinet Peninsula to start one of three Devil Islands; safe havens for Tasmanian devil breeding populations to be isolated from populations infected with the devil facial tumour disease. She has also supported Brightside Animal Sanctuary, an animal sanctuary in Cygnet, Tasmania, through the Elsie Cameron Fund, for several years. Cameron has also continued to donate profits from all Chickenfeed stores in Tasmania to various charities, for the last two years. Cameron gained media attention in Tasmania when she and Graeme Wood, founder of Wotif.com purchased the Triabunna native forest woodchip mill, installing former Wilderness Society executive director Alec Marr as manager. After the Premier of Tasmania Lara Giddings contacted her, it was agreed that the woodchip mill would continue for 4 to 5 years, before it is converted into the planned eco-resort. Currently, the mill is not in operation. Honours In the 2010 Queen's Birthday Honours, Cameron was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to business and philanthropy. Her investiture by the Governor-General of New Zealand took place on 14 April 2011.

The bell gable (, , , ) is an architectural element crowning the upper end of the wall of church buildings, usually in lieu of a church tower. It consists of a gable end in stone, with small hollow semi-circular arches where the church bells are placed. It is a characteristic example of the simplicity of Romanesque architecture. Overview Bell-gables or espada√±as are a feature of Romanesque architecture in Spain. Since they were easier and cheaper to build than a church tower or bell tower, they are especially common in small village churches throughout the Iberian Peninsula. This simple and sober architectural element would later be brought to the Americas and the Philippines by Iberian colonizers.Luis Navarro Garc√≠a, Am√©rica en el siglo XVIII. Los primeros Borbones, The bell gable usually rises over the front fa√ßade wall, but in some churches it may be located on top of any other wall or even on top of the toral arch in the midst of the roof. In Catalonia and the Valencian Community bell-gables are also known as campanar de paret (wall bell tower) or campanar de cadireta.Rom√†nic de la Vall de Camprodon (little-chair bell tower) because it reminds one of the back of a chair.

It is applicable to both organic compounds and inorganic compounds and may be used with or without an enzymatic stage. The method is widely used in medical laboratories and for industrial purposes, e.g. the analysis of water samples in connection with industrial water treatment. Equipment The equipment required is a colorimeter, some cuvettes and a suitable color reagent. The process may be automated, e.g. by the use of an AutoAnalyzer or by flow injection analysis. Recently, colorimetric analyses developed for colorimeters have been adapted for use with plate readers to speed up analysis and reduce the waste stream.Greenan, N. S., R.L. Mulvaney, and G.K.

As the enzyme is specific to a particular substrate, more accurate results can be obtained. Enzymatic analysis is always carried out in a buffer solution at a specified temperature (usually 37¬∞C) to provide the optimum conditions for the enzymes to act. Examples follow. Examples ;Cholesterol (CHOD-PAP method) # Cholesterol + oxygen --(enzyme cholesterol oxidase)--> cholestenone + hydrogen peroxide # Hydrogen peroxide + 4-aminophenazone + phenol --(enzyme peroxidase)--> colored complex + waterReference to follow ;Glucose (GOD-Perid method) # Glucose + oxygen + water --(enzyme glucose oxidase)--> gluconate + hydrogen peroxide # Hydrogen peroxide + ABTS --(enzyme peroxidase)--> colored complexRey and Wielinger (1970) Z. analyt. chem. 252:224 In this case, both stages of the reaction are catalyzed by enzymes. ;Triglycerides (GPO-PAP method) # Triglycerides + water --(enzyme esterase)--> glycerol + carboxylic acid # Glycerol + ATP --(enzyme glycerol kinase)--> glycerol-3-phosphate + ADP # Glycerol-3-phosphate + oxygen --(enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase) --> dihydroxyacetone phosphate + hydrogen peroxide # Hydrogen peroxide + 4-aminophenazone + 4-chlorophenol --(enzyme peroxidase)--> colored complexReference to follow ;Urea # Urea + water --(enzyme urease)--> ammonium carbonate # Ammonium carbonate + phenol + hypochlorite ----> colored complexFawcett and Scott (1960) J.

The film is based on the novel They Called Him Death by David Hume. This film was long thought entirely lost, but a dubbed Italian version has been traced. Having named the film on their \\"BFI 75 Most Wanted\\" list, the British Film Institute subsequently screened a discovered American reel of the film under its American title of 'The Patient Vanishes' in 2017 at its Big Thrill event - the first time the film had been shown on reel in the United Kingdom in seventy years.https://lovelondonloveculture.com/2017/10/30/preview- the-big-thrill-bfi-southbank/ Plot Mick Cardby (Mason) earns a living as a self-employed private detective, to the exasperation of his father, Detective Inspector Cardby of Scotland Yard (McLeod), who would much prefer his son to enrol as a regular policeman. A policeman is killed while on duty in Hyde Park and Scotland Yard are keen to catch the killer of their colleague. Mick launches his own enquiries, which lead him to Lord Morne (G. H. Mulcaster) who is frantic with worry as his daughter Lena has been abducted by a gang of blackmailers. Lord Morne offers Mick ¬£1,000 to recover Lena safely. Mick gets to work and, aided by his secretary Molly (Margaret Vyner), tracks down the kidnappers to a shady nursing home in a remote rural area. However they manage to flee with Lena to North Wales. The kidnappers arrange a ransom drop with Lord Morne, but Mick arranges for him to go into hiding and goes to the rendezvous himself in disguise. His deception is uncovered and he is overpowered and taken to a derelict cargo ship. The gang use torture to try to get him to reveal Lord Morne's whereabouts, but Mick keeps his nerve and refuses to divulge the information. Finally they throw him into the ship's hold and set the vessel on fire. Mick manages to escape in the nick of time, and also rescues a member of the gang who had apparently been deemed surplus to requirements and had also been left to die on the blazing ship. This man is understandably disgruntled by his treatment at the hands of his former partners in crime, and is only to happy to help Mick out with the location where Lena is being held. Mick makes his way to the hideout and approaches stealthily, but not well enough to avoid being spotted by a lookout. A dramatic confrontation follows, and just as things are starting to look desperate for Mick, his father turns up with a Scotland Yard posse to save the day. The gang is captured and the rescued Lena is reunited with her father. She expresses her gratitude to Mick, with the hope that they will get to know each other better.

Kine Weekly spoke of \\"exciting plot, fast action, good thrills, popular romantic and comedy asides, vigorous teamwork, hectic climax...\\", and added: \\"It gets away to a flying start and never calls a halt in its hectic gyrations...until crime is paid for in full, youth is vindicated and romance triumphs\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin, never known for being overly generous with its praise, wrote: \\"An admirable cast under the very capable direction of Lawrence Huntington keep the suspense at boiling-point until the end.\\" In the U.S., the Motion Picture Herald described it as \\"a thrilling melodrama\\", although the writer wondered about the ability of American audiences to understand the British accents of the cast. The current status of the film is unclear. Although it is said to have been shown on British television as recently as 1987, the film was never commercially released to the VHS format of the time, and in fact a 1987 transmission may be debatable because the only film of this title which appears to have been shown that year in the digital archives of the Times, Guardian, Daily Express and Daily Mirror is a 1985 American TV movie. The British Film Institute does not hold a print in the National Archive and attempts to track it down have so far been proved fruitless. Before its partial rediscovery, the film was classed as \\"missing, believed lost\\" and is included on the BFI's \\"75 Most Wanted\\" list of missing British feature films. However, a dubbed copy has been shown on Italian television (which has even been released on DVD under the title name \\"Il ricattatore\\"), and the BFI are optimistic about tracing an English print. The film was subsequently discovered in its entirety after the discovery of an American reel in which the title card displays the US title of 'The Patient Vanishes'. This was shown at the BFI in 2017.

In the context of the socio-economic and political realities of the country as well as development initiatives by the civil society organizations in Pakistan, we are of the opinion that unless rights agenda led by people‚Äôs movements around rights and the issues contributing to the collectivism and interestedness in development initiatives based on the basic values of liberties and liberations of individuals and of collectives in the social, economic and cultural realms is not made a core strategy of development in the country, it will become almost impossible to achieve the destiny of the socially, economic and culturally liberated and empowered man, women, children, youth, religious and ethnic minorities and vulnerable classes. 2\\\\. The economic self-reliance and livelihood security combined with right based initiatives are the essential tiers of the development outlook required by Sindh, Pakistan, South Asia and rest of the world. 3\\\\. A democracy in which people are not elevated enough to reach the stage of ‚Äòthe governance by the people‚Äô is never considered a true democracy. 4\\\\. Justice and Peace are foundation values of a truly free human society. Any initiative for the development and socio-economic uplift of the people does not favor as well as promote these values will prove to be retrogressive in the context of social development. 5\\\\. Diversity in all of its forms is the beauty of modern social web emerged through modern human and industrial development. 6\\\\. Humanity and all other forms of life have equal right over what is offered by nature on the globe. Being a higher form of consciousness, human is more responsible to earth and all forms of life over it. 7\\\\. The initiatives by state or non state actors that contradict or devoid of the essential rights of freedoms agreed under various charters of United Nations to various classes, nations and ethnicities, cultural groups, religions and sects, minorities and genders are considered to be against the core values of a just and true spirit of democracy. 8\\\\. A healthier political discourse and culture is necessary for the development, democracy and peace. 9\\\\. Spiritually rich and elevated individuals are the foundation for socially and culturally rich human society. 10\\\\. Non-violence is core value of actions and initiatives for the human development.

Background In 1510, the Spaniards had established themselves on a small island in front of Algiers, and forced the local ruler SƒÅlim al-T≈´mƒ´ (Selim-bin-Teumi) to accept their presence through a treaty and pay tribute.International Dictionary of Historic Places: Middle East and Africa Trudy Ring p.54 Fortifications were built on the islet, and a garrison of 200 men was established. SƒÅlim al-T≈´mƒ´ had to go to Spain to take an oath of obedience to Ferdinand of Aragon. Capture of Algiers In 1516, the amir of Algiers, SƒÅlim al-T≈´mƒ´, invited the corsair brothers Oru√ß and Hayreddin Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Oru√ß, with the help of Ottoman troops, came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of SƒÅlim, because Salim was conspiring with the Spaniards against the pirates and Arudj. The Moors have done a huge triumph to Arudj. He then seized the town. Spanish expeditions were sent to take over the city, first in 1516 under Don Diego de Vera, and then in 1519 under Don Ugo de Moncada, but both expeditions ended in failure. Hayreddin succeeded Oru√ß after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards at the Fall of Tlemcen (1517), as well as inheriting his nickname \\"Barbarossa\\". The capture of Algiers in 1516 had been made possible with the support of the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. This support was discontinued with Sultan Selim's death in 1520, causing Barbarossa to lose the city to a local kabyle chieftain in 1524,E.J.

Taxonomy and etymology The Auckland Island snipe was first collected in 1840 both by Charles Wilkes‚Äô United States Exploring Expedition, and James Ross‚Äô Erebus and Terror Antarctic expedition, with the British specimens forming the basis for George Gray's 1844 description. The species name, and hence the subspecific epithet, refer to the type locality. Description The subspecies is generally similar to others in the genus, being a small, brown, cryptically- patterned snipe with a long bill, short neck, tail and legs, and short, rounded wings.

Maragkopoulos; b. Athens, 1948) is a Greek author, literary critic and translator. He studied History and Archeology at the University of Athens, History of Art and Archeology at the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne. Marangopoulos is a politically committed intellectual (but with no political adherence to any particular party) who has been writing since the early eighties.http://www.toposbooks.gr/contents/eng/writerseng.php?wid=15 Some of his older fiction cult books deal with the Utopian idea of communal love as a means of civil disobedience but those more recent and more widely read deal with a contemporary social context, pictured through known historic facts of political disobedience against state impingement of civil rights. In seeming contrast to that realist predilection his literary style, though, should not be defined as purely realistic. A writer who, in some of his older books, has adopted the modernist form of a po√®me en prose A.M. rather stands for an elective modernist style. Vassilis Vassilikos, author of the novel Z, has written for Marangopoulos' politically engaged novel Obsession with Spring:Terrorism in Greece is the subject of the novel. A critic, Dimosthenis Kourtovik, wrote in his review for the book: ¬´The novel constitutes a political criticism of terrorism, the first essential criticism to appear in Greek literature¬ª (In Ta Nea, March 10, 2007). > ¬´It is the outcome of a difficult journey through the clashing rocks of > James Joyce and Jorge Luis Borges, a fruitful journey that made him > rediscover Honor√© de Balzac‚Äôs gold‚Ä¶ A fantastic political thriller, an > anatomy of the country we call Hellas, a novel that opens a wide discussion > amid the reading community since it re-reads our recent history¬ªVassilis > Vassilikos, in To Vima, November 19, 2006 His more widely read novel so far (and one of his best as most critics agree),See e.g. Titika Dimitroulia's review (in Kathimerini, January 27, 2013) , Dimosthenis Kourtovik's (in Ta Nea, December 29, 2012) et alias. The Slap- tree, is a story that reviews post-war Greece through the eyes of a foreign woman, a Welsh teacher who during WW II fell in love with a young Greek communist and thereafter put every possible effort to free him from an incarceration of 17 years (a true story which made to the first page of international media in the sixties).http://www.toposbooks.gr/contents/eng/books_details_eng.php?nid=233 Apart from its literary merits the story has ignited a certain discussion and dispute in Greece as to the possible ways of narrating historic facts in literature. His ¬´French¬ª novel Paul et Laura, tableau d‚Äôapr√®s nature (Topos books 2017) is inspired by the lives of the intellectual activist Paul Lafargue (1842-1911, best known for his polemic essay The Right To Be Lazy) and his wife Laura Marx (1845-1911). The mythical life of these two characters who at their old age (Paul 69, Laura 66) decided to die together by a suicide pact is painted in this novel as a concave mirror reflecting the tumultuous development of the European society in the second half of 19th and the beginnings of the 20th century. The novel is considered by all critics to be the opus magnum of the author: See e.g. A. Sainis's review (in Efimerida Syntakton 19.02.17), Efi Giannopoulou's (in Epochi, 24.01.17), Maria Moira's (in Aygi of Sunday, 19.03.17) [See more reviews in Greek and English here]. This last critic has noted on account of this book: > ¬´This daring narrative by Aris Maragkopoulos dips decisively into a > staggering factual material comprising important historical characters and > shocking social contents, multi specific primary sources, indexed > information and multiple cross linked time records. The author, for the sake > of the plot fills with sensitivity, respect and creative verve the space > between the prominent historical moments that marked the course of our > world, giving the historical figures of the central ideological scene a > human face and in their daily lives a parallel dimension of plausibility. He > removes the strangeness created by the distance in time and the inevitable > mythology, and creates a dense grid of inventive interventions and > interstitial links.¬ªAygi of Sunday, 19.03.17.

He was also the founder of the Sakurai-branch of the Matsudaira clan. Biography Matsudaira Tadayori was the younger son of Matsudaira Tadayoshi, a hereditary retainer of the Tokugawa clan. During the Battle of Sekigahara, he was assigned to the defense of Okazaki Castle in Mikawa Province, and in 1601 was entrusted with Inuyama Castle in Owari Province and Kaneyama Castle in Mino Province. The same year, on the death of his uncle Matsudaira Iehiro, he inherited Musashi-Matsuyama Domain (15,000 koku), which together with the 10,000 koku in revenue from his other holdings, qualified him as a daimy≈ç. In 1602, Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu doubled his income to 50,000 koku and reassigned him to Hamamatsu Domain in T≈çt≈çmi Province. In December 1607, he was called to assist in the rebuilding of Sunpu Castle, which had burned down. On September 29, 1609, while in attendance during sankin-k≈çtai duty in Edo, he attended a tea ceremony held by Mizuno Tadatane, which was also attended by the hatamoto Kume Saheiji and Hattori Hanhachir≈ç. After the ceremony, the participants drank sake and played go. However, and argument erupted which resulted in drawn swords, with Hattori stabbing and killing Matsudaira Tadayori. Hattori and Mizuno were both ordered to commit seppuku over the incident a month later. Tadayori was married to a daughter of Oda Nagamasu by whom he had six sons, but the eldest Matsudaira Tadashige was still a child at the time of his death. In view of his age and the circumstances of his father's death, he was reduced to hatamoto status and Hamamatsu Domain was transferred to K≈çriki Tadafusa.

Standard of the Maharaja ca 1874‚Äì1936 Last standard of the Maharaja ca. 1936‚Äì1949 Baroda State was a state in present-day Gujarat, ruled by the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha Confederacy from its formation in 1721 until its accession to the newly-formed Dominion of India in 1949. With the city of Baroda (Vadodara) as its capital, during the British Raj its relations with the British were managed by the Baroda Residency. The revenue of the state in 1901 was Rs. 13,661,000. Baroda formally acceded to the Union of India, on 1 May 1949, prior to which an interim government was formed in the state. History=Early history Baroda State, 1896 Sir Sayajirao Gaekwad III (1863‚Äì1939), Maharaja of Baroda Baroda derives its native name Vadodara from the Sanskrit word vatodara, meaning 'in the heart of the Banyan (Vata) tree. It also has another name, Virakshetra or Virawati (land of warriors), mentioned alongside Vadodara by the 17th century Gujarati poet Premanand Bhatt, native to the city. Its name has been mentioned as Brodera by early English travellers and merchants, from which its later name Baroda was derived.Gazetteer, p. 25 Geographically it comprised several disjointed tracts of land, measuring over 1000 square miles, spread across the present Gujarat state; these were subdivided into four prant (states), namely Kadi, Baroda, Navsari and Amreli, which included coastal portions of the state, in the Okhamadal region near Dwarka and Kodinar near Diu.Gazetteer, p. 26 The Marathas first attacked Gujarat in 1705. By 1712, a Maratha leader Khande Rao Dabhade grew powerful in the region and when he returned to Satara in 1716, he was made the senapati (commander in chief). Thereafter during the \\"Battle of Balapur\\" in 1721, one of his officers, Damaji Gaekwad was awarded the title Shamsher Bahadur or Distinguished Swordsman. Damaji died in 1721 and was succeeded by his nephew Pilajirao.Gazetteer, p. 31, 32 Thus the Baroda State was founded in 1721, when the Maratha general Pilaji Gaekwad conquered Songadh from the Mughals. Prior to this Pilajirao was appointed as general to collect revenues from Gujarat by the Peshwa, the effective ruler of the Maratha Empire, who had taken over the region north and south of Surat from the Mughals to established the Sarkar of Surat. Songadh remained the headquarters of the \\"House of Gaekwad\\" until 1866.Gazetteer, 32 After the Second Anglo- Maratha War (1803‚Äì1805), the East India Company wrested control of much of Gujarat from the Marathas. However the Gaekwads of Baroda (Vadodara), made a separate peace with the British, entering into a subsidiary alliance which acknowledged British suzerainty and control of the state's external affairs in return for retaining internal autonomy. Princely state Silver rupee of Sayaji Rao II of Baroda (ruled 1819‚Äì47), naming the Mughal emperor Muhammad Akbar II, dated AH 1238 (= 1822‚Äì23 CE). The prominent Nagari letter sa stands for Sayaji Rao and we also see a curved sword, one of the dynastic symbols of the Gaekwads and seen also on the Baroda state flag. Silver rupee of Sayaji Rao III of Baroda (ruled 1875‚Äì1939), showing his portrait. This coin is dated 1955 in the Vikrama era (= 1897 CE). Following the death of Sir Khanderao Gaekwad (1828‚Äì1870), the popular Maharaja of Baroda, in 1870, it was expected that his brother, Malharrao (1831‚Äì1882), would succeed him. However, Malharrao had already proven himself to be of the vilest character and had been imprisoned earlier for conspiring to assassinate Khanderao. As Khanderao's widow, Maharani Jamnabai (1853‚Äì1898) was already pregnant with a posthumous child, the succession was delayed until the gender of the child could be proven. The child proved to be a daughter, and so upon her birth on 5 July 1871, Malharrao ascended the throne. Malharrao spent money liberally, nearly emptying the Baroda coffers (he commissioned a pair of solid gold cannon and a carpet of pearls, among other expenses) and soon reports reached the Resident of Malharrao's gross tyranny and cruelty. Malharrao further attempted to cover up his deeds by poisoning the Resident, Colonel R. Phayre C.B. with a compound of arsenic. By order of the Secretary of State for India, Lord Salisbury, Malharrao was deposed on 10 April 1875 and exiled to Madras, where he died in obscurity in 1882. With the throne of Baroda now vacant, Maharani Jamnabai called on the heads of the extended branches of the dynasty to come to Baroda and present themselves and their sons in order to decide upon a successor. Makarpura Palace, built by Maharaja Khende Rao in 1870 Kashirao and his three sons, Anandrao (1857‚Äì1917), Gopalrao (1863‚Äì1938) and Sampatrao (1865‚Äì1934) walked to Baroda from Kavlana-a distance of some 600 kilometers-to present themselves to Jamnabai. Eventually Gopalrao was selected by the British Government as successor and was accordingly adopted by Maharani Jamnabai, on 27 May 1875. He was also given a new name, Sayajirao. On 16 June 1875, he ascended the throne as Sayajirao Gaekwad III, but being a minor, reigned under a Council of Regency until he came of age and was invested with full ruling powers on 28 December 1881. founding numerous institutions, 20th century Various important state institutions were founded in the early 20th century, including the Bank of Baroda on 20 July 1908. In 1908, Sayajirao also founded the Baroda Legislative Assembly (also known as the Baroda Dhara Sabha).Laxmi Vilas Palace, Baroda, built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1890 By the beginning of the 20th century, the relations of the British with the four largest princely states‚ÄîHyderabad, Mysore, Jammu and Kashmir, and Baroda were managed by a British Resident under the direct authority the Governor-General of India.Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV (1907), p. 92. In 1911, Baroda State spanned , and the population was 2,032,798 persons as per the 1911 census of India. The state was very wealthy. The Pittsburgh Press reported in 1927 that the diamond necklace, which contained the Star of the South diamond, was a part of a royal collection worth $10,000,000 at the time, housed in the Nazarbaug Palace (built 1721) in Baroda city; another important part of the collection was a cloth embroidered with precious stones and seed pearls, made to cover the tomb of Mohammed. Dr. B.R.Ambedkar writes about his experience with untouchability in Baroda in the second chapter of his autobiographical book, Waiting for a Visa. In 1937 the princely states of the Baroda Residency were merged with those of the agencies adjacent to the northern part of the Bombay Presidency ‚ÄîRewa Kantha Agency, Surat Agency, Nasik Agency, Kaira Agency and Thana Agency‚Äî in order to form the Baroda and Gujarat States Agency.History of the State of Gujarat A few years before independence the process of the 'Attachment Scheme' began in order to integrate the smallest princely states, estates and thanas. Baroda State was one of the main beneficiaries of this measure by being able to add about 15,000 km¬≤ and half a million inhabitants to the state. The merged states were Pethapur on 1 February 1940, the Katosan Thana, with Deloli, Kalsapura, Maguna, Memadpura, Rampura, Ranipura, Tejpura, Varsora, the Palaj Taluka and both Ijpura States between June and July 1940. These were followed on 10 July 1943 by the states of Ambliara, Ghorasar, Ilol, Katosan, Khadal, Patdi, Punadra, Ranasan, Wasoda and Waowhich had been fourth class states in the Mahi Kantha Agency. Also many small Talukas of the region were merged. On 24 July 1943 Sachodar State and a few small places that had no own jurisdiction were annexed. By December of the same year the small states of Bajana, Bhilka, Malpur, Mansa and Vadia followed suit.McLeod, John; Sovereignty, power, control: politics in the States of Western India, 1916‚Äì1947; Leiden u.a. 1999; ; p. 160 Finally on 5 November 1944 the Baroda and Gujarat States Agency was merged with the Western India States Agency (WISA) to form the larger Baroda, Western India and Gujarat States Agency. After the independence of India, which initially did not include Baroda or many other princely states, an interim government under Prime Minister Dr. Jivraj Narayan Mehta, son-in-law of Manubhai Mehta, then Dewan of Baroda state, was inaugurated in the State, on 4 September 1948, by the then Maharaja at a special Durbar in the Laxmi Vilas Palace, Baroda. Finally on 1 May 1949, Baroda State, the third largest state at the time of British India, formally acceded to the Dominion of India, Initially, Baroda merged with the Bombay state, and then, on 1 May 1960, when the two new states of Gujarat and Maharashtra were formed, it became part of Gujarat, with Dr. Jivraj Narayan Mehta becoming the first Chief Minister of Gujarat.  Koli Rebellion Against Baroda State  The Koli rebellion was led by two brothers Nathaji Patel and Yamaji Patel, chiefs of Chandap Taluq. During the great Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Kolis of Chandap under Nathaji and Yamaji planning for revolt and gaekwad of Baroda received that news. So Gaekwad stationed his cavalry at Chandap to control the rebels. But cavalry of Gaekwad was killed and thrown out by Kolis of Chandap. After that Kolis went into hills and continued their rebellion for few months. In the end of October 1857, the combined forces of British and Baroda attacked Kolis and burnt the Chandap village. Baroda State Railway The state owned the Gaekwar's Baroda State Railway (GBSR), which started in 1862 as the first narrow-gauge in India. It consisted of of narrow gauge track from Dabhoi to Miyagam. The railway network extended to Goyagate, Chandod, Bodeli and Samalaya Jn with Dabhoi as its focal point. After independence in 1949 this railway merged with the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. The lines are under conversion to broad gauge currently.Dabhoi-Bodeli broad gauge section to become operational Baroda State Navy In late 18th century, the Baroda state established a Naval set up at Billimora, a port about 40 miles south of Surat, known as Bunder Billimora Suba Armor. Here a fleet of 50 vessels was stationed, which included mostly sails, cargo vessels for trading and military vessels to secure the sea from Portuguese, Dutch and French. When political alignments changed, after the Second Anglo-Maratha war, a joint expedition of British and Baroda state troops under Colonel Walker, then resident of Baroda, approached Kathiawad in 1808, and eventually obtained bonds from the chiefs of Okha-mandal and from the maritime states of Kathiawad renouncing piracy. Then in 1813, the Baroda government acquired the parganah of Kodinar (in present Junagadh district), where at port of Velan a small fleet of four frigates with 12-pounder guns on each for the protection of the trade between Bombay and Sindh was established. These four armed vessels were named Anandprasad, Sarsuba, Anamat Vart and Anne Maria, which was purchased from the Shah of Iran, and was known as 'Shah Kai Khusru' until then.

Life Anzieu studied philosophy and was a pupil of Daniel Lagache, before undertaking his first psychoanalysis with Jacques Lacan. Then, after discovering that Lacan had also treated his mother (\\"Aim√©e\\"), he began a second analysis with Georges Favez. He retained a deep grudge against Lacan's lack of candor and later also condemned the excesses and arbitrary practices of the Lacanians ‚Äî highlighting the latter's 'unending dependence on an idol, a logic, or a language', as well as the pervasively tantalizing element in Lacan's approach, with 'fundamental truths to be revealed...but always at some further point'.Quoted in Sherry Turkle, Psychoanalytic Politics (London 1978) p. 131 Among Anzieu's many significant contributions to psychoanalysis were his work on Freud's self-analysis and his extensive study of groups, relying in particular on the work of Wilfred Ruprecht Bion. Building on the writings of such psychoanalysts as Melanie Klein and Heinz Kohut, Anzieu also sought with great skill to analyze, not so much works of art, but the creative process itself; and he published numerous works on literary creation (Pascal, Beckett) and artistic creation (Bacon)'.Markos Zafiropoulos, Lacan and Levi-Strauss (London 2010) p. 32n Perhaps the most telling strand in his writings, however, was that of the so- called Skin-Ego, and the related concept of the \\"Psychic Envelope\\".

Barron, Self-Analysis (1993) p. 239 He also highlights the role of inner resistance to creativity: 'resistance consists of a searing and demoralising doubt as to the value of what we are in the process of discovering'.Anzieu, Freud's Self-Analysis p. 111 On psychic envelopes Emerging from ideas of holding in such writers as Marion Milner and Donald Winnicott, and then 'migrating into Continental psychoanalysis, the idea of the skin-container takes on a life of its own...shap[ing] Didier Anzieu's influential concept of the psychic envelope in The Skin-Ego (Le Moi-peau).Mary Jacobus, The Poetics of Psychoanalysis (Oxford 2005) p. 126 'Didier Anzieu (1985) theorized on the skin-ego, the first narcissistic envelope on which the feeling of well-being is based',Alcira M.

Lester, Boundaries and Boundary Violations in Psychoanalysis (2002) Chap I Anzieu would extend the concept to a broader notion of \\"psychic envelope\\", exploring for example the idea of 'the dream envelope. This is the name Didier Anzieu gives to the visual dream-film, the fine, ephemeral membrane which he thinks of as replacing the tactile envelope of the ego's vulnerable skin'.Jacobus, p. 9 'With his development of a related concept, the \\"sound envelope\\" Anzieu articulates the bodily ego's relation to psychic space in terms of breath'.Jacobus, p. 131 In terms of groups, Anzieu also maintained that 'there is no group without a common skin, a containing envelope, which makes it possible for its members to experience the existence of a group self'.Quoted in Richard Morgan-Jones, The Body of the Organisation and its Health (London 2010) p. 91 Criticism 'For a critique of Anzieu's \\"interpretatively versatile\\" pan-pellicularism and his therapeutically oriented model of the skin-container, see Steven Connor, The Book of Skin (London...2004)'.Jacobus, p. 126n 'Kaja Silverman argues that the emphasis by Anzieu and others (including Kristeva) on the maternal voice as sound envelope \\"grows out of a powerful cultural fantasy...the image of a child held within the environment or sphere of the mother's voice\\"'.Jacobus, p. 131n ReferencesFurther reading * Didier Anzieu, The Group and the Unconscious (Routledge 1984) * Didier Anzieu ed, Psychic Envelopes (London 1990) Category:French psychoanalysts Category:1999 deaths Category:Analysands of Jacques Lacan Category:1923 births Category:People from Melun ","title":"Didier Anzieu"},{"id":"29214808","text":"Gorham House, also known as Elliot House, is a historic home located at Loudonville in Albany County, New York.

In 1678 Davys was granted the office of Principal Secretary for Ireland in reversion in the event of the demise of the current office holder Lord Lanesborough, who died in 1683. This office had been previously held by his father Sir Paul Davys. He was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland in about 1682. During the Popish Plot, both John and his brother were accused of Catholic sympathies and summoned to London to account for their behaviour, but were cleared of any suspicion of disloyalty on the evidence of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, a lifelong friend of their father, and Michael Boyle, Archbishop of Armagh, who was William's father-in-law. After the accession of James II, John is said to have opposed the King's policies and to have absented himself from Ireland for a time.Ball 1906 p.32 Francis Elrington Ball in his History of Dublin praises John Davys as a man of prudence and integrity.Ball 1906, p.32 Family By his wife, Anne Thelwall, Davys had two sons, Paul and Robert. Under the will of their uncle Sir William Davys, whichever of them married Sir William's stepdaughter Lady Catherine MacCarty (daughter of Callaghan MacCarty, 3rd Earl of Clancarty and Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald) would inherit the principal Davys estate, St Catherine's Park, Leixlip.Ball 1906, pp.32-33 The elder, Paul, duly married her, and was later created Viscount Mountcashell, reviving the title held by his wife's uncle Justin MacCarthy, Viscount Mountcashell.

This is illustrated in the fictional case of \\"Rex vs Haddock\\" in which a remark by one of the parties is compared to the thirteenth stroke of a clock: not only is this thirteenth strike itself discredited, but it casts a shade of doubt over all previous assertions.Prosser, p. 74.A.P. Herbert, Uncommon Law, \\"(5) Rex v. Haddock: Is it a free country?\\", p.28. De rigueur, the full quote reads: \\"If I may use an expression which I have used many times before in this Court, it is like the thirteenth stroke of a crazy clock, which not only is itself discredited but casts a shade of doubt over all previous assertions.\\" This proverb puts forth the notion that if just one of someone's proclamations is wrong, or something of a process is wrong, then the correctness and accuracy of all the previous items is called into question. In a legal case it brings forth the notion that perhaps none of the party's claims are valid, given that one of them is obviously wrong.Tigar, p 436. A physicist and mathematician notes the problem with his variation on the same general idea. He points out that if a clock strikes the thirteenth hour then it has counted wrongly and reflects on the other twelve hours of the clock's strokes as then they could also be wrong.Perelmuter, p. 480. Within the 24-hour clock system used for official and technical purposes throughout most of the world, there is a time that could be called \\"13 o'clock\\". However, the 24-hour system only came into widespread use in the 20th century, and most analogue clocks (including virtually all chiming or striking clocks) still work on the 12-hour system. A striking clock rings a bell once for each hour of the time. One ring is 1 o'clock, two rings is 2 o'clock, three rings is 3 o'clock, etc. Traditional clocks that strike a bell only mark 12 hours. After the twelfth hour with the twelve rings of the bell then the next hour should be with one ring only, indicating 1 o'clock. Accordingly, with very rare exceptions, when a clock rings thirteen times it is indicating an impossible time and that the clock is not functioning correctly. A children's riddle asks \\"What time is it when the clock strikes thirteen?\\" The answer is \\"Time to get a new clock!\\"  Striking clock mechanism  Part of tower clock internal works A 100-year-old tower striking clock has a striking mechanism, called a snail, with indentations that vary in depth progressively from one to twelve. It rotates via a gear drive over a twelve-hour period. Shortly before each hour a rack with twelve cuts along its length is released to contact the snail. This makes the number of cuts available to activate the strike mechanism correspond to the depth of the snail at that hour.Hasluck, p. 93. Testing the rack in its place allows it to fall until the tail rests on the lowest step of the snail. The hook of the rack should then hold the rack so that there are twelve teeth gathered up. Trying it on the highest step of the snail, should catch the first rack tooth. This leaves only one to be gathered up. If the clock strikes thirteen when on the lowest step and two when on the highest, it shows that the end of the rack tail is a little too far off from the snail and must be set a little closer. If on the other hand the snail strikes the right number when on the lowest step and two when on the highest, then the proportion between the snail and rack is wrong. The rack travel is too great for the rack.  Culture  St Paul's Cathedral SW tower clock There is an 18th-century London legend of a clock that struck thirteen times and saved a man's life. The story goes that St Paul's Cathedral clock on one occasion struck thirteen bongs of the bell at midnight, with the result of saving the life of a soldier accused of sleeping at his post. An obituary notice of a John Hatfield that appeared in the Public Advertiser a few days after his death states that a soldier in the time of William III and Mary II was tried by a court-martial on a charge of having fallen asleep when on duty upon the terrace at Windsor. It goes on to say that he categorically denied the charge against him. He swore as a proof of his having been awake at the time that he heard St Paul's Cathedral clock strike thirteen, the truth of which was much doubted by the court because of the great distance. Affidavits were made by several persons verifying that the clock actually did strike thirteen instead of twelve, and the soldier was pardoned. There is a poem that alludes to this published in 1774 called A Trip to Windsor by Timothy Scribble: Adolf Hitler is quoted as saying, \\"I make it a principle not to stop until the clock strikes thirteen\\". This was in reference to him never giving up as Germany did in the First World War. This was said in November 1942 as the almost certain defeat of the German army, at Stalingrad became certain, and the German army had retreated in North Africa. He wanted to point out to his enemy that he was not going to surrender under any circumstances, by using an analogy that theoretically could not happen.Giblin, p. 173. Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, owned extensive coal mines near Manchester. He spent a fortune operating them and a canal to carry the coal to Manchester and Liverpool. He noticed that his workers ceased working the moment the bell struck twelve times at twelve o'clock, which was lunch time. They, however, were slow in returning to work at one o'clock. The excuse was that they did not hear the clock strike just once. The Duke then had the clock made to strike thirteen times at one o'clock, so that the men could no longer use the excuse that they did not hear it.Chatterbox, p. 299. Mark Twain is claimed to have said: \\"The thirteenth stroke of the clock is not only false of itself, but casts grave doubt on the credibility of the preceding twelve\\".Paliwal, p. 625.  Literature  The idea of a clock striking thirteen times has shown up many times in literature. The most famous is the first line in George Orwell‚Äôs Nineteen Eighty-Four when it starts with, \\"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen\\".Orwell, p. 1. The famous children's book Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce speaks of this phenomenon when it says \\"When Tom hears old Mrs Bartholomew's grandfather clock in the hall striking thirteen, he goes to investigate\\".Bicknell, p. 35. Thomas Hardy's Far from the Madding Crowd (1874) 'This supreme instance of Troy's goodness fell upon Gabriel's ears like the thirteenth stroke of a crazy clock' (Chapter XXIX, Particulars of a twilight walk)  Why don't 24-hour clocks strike thirteen?  Most countries around the world use the 24-hour system for technical purposes and in documents such as timetables; the United States is an exception,Collis, p. 55. although US military bodies do use the 24-hour clock. Most digital clocks can be set to show the time as, for example, 13:00, and this is frequently done. However, typical analogue clock design conserves the 12-hour system, and so does everyday speech. In English, in fact, the term \\"13 o'clock\\" is not used; when referring to something like a timetable that uses the 24-hour clock, or in a military context, one would say \\"Thirteen hundred hours\\". In other European languages, the terms equivalent to \\"13 o'clock\\" are used, e.g. in French one usually refers to 1pm as \\"treize heures\\", though it would not be incorrect to say \\"une heure de l'apr√®s-midi\\", the equivalent of \\"1pm\\".Beissinger, p. 105.

The group was formed by songwriters Ian Burgoyne and Keith Band.

Jazzateers were signed to Postcard Records and managed during this period by label boss Alan Horne. Jazzateers were also the final scheduled release of the Postcard catalogue (81-14) with their Edwyn Collins produced cover of a Donna Summer song, \\"Wasted\\". However, consistent with Jazzateers inconsistent career trajectory, the single was unreleased as Postcard Records folded. Alan Horne then produced a Jazzateers album, 'Lee,' which also remains unreleased. After the demise of Postcard, Jazzateers followed labelmates The Go-Betweens and Aztec Camera by signing to Rough Trade Records, finally releasing an eponymously-titled debut album in 1983. The album was a critical and commercial success, but true to Jazzateers contrary spirit, they put the Jazzateers brand on hold and transmogrified into Bourgie Bourgie, signing a major label deal. Bourgie Bourgie recorded an album (unreleased) and split up after a couple of singles. Jazzateers were reactivated after Bourgie Bourgie split, with new vocalist Matt Willcock joining and taking over lyrical input. Prior to Willcock joining, the songs had been written by Jazzateers core members, Ian Burgoyne and Keith Band, and sung by various vocalists (Alison Gourlay, the Rutkowski Sisters, Grahame Skinner, Paul Quinn). However the injection of new blood provided by Willcock and lead guitarist Mick Slaven, created the perfect environment for Jazzateers to finally hit their peak flow. Slaven's Tom Verlaine / Robert Quine influences took centre stage in the group, along with Willcock's poetic lyrical approach. The Blood is Sweeter Than Honey recording sessions found Jazzateers developing an approach akin to Destiny Street and Adventure (the sophomore albums by Richard Hell & the Voidoids and Television) respectively. A single (\\"Pressing On\\") was released to acclaim, garnering Single of the Week plaudits in the music press, which coincided with Jazzateers promoting the release by touring the UK as special guests of Lloyd Cole and the Commotions. However, Jazzateers errant history was repeated when the attendant album (Blood is Sweeter Than Honey), was shelved, and the group fractured shortly thereafter. Blood Is Sweeter Than Honey was released for the first time via the Creeping Bent Organisation and is available in deluxe gatefold 180g vinyl and download editions. Much of the band's unreleased Postcard-era recordings were released in August 2014 by Cherry Red Records / Creeping Bent on the album Don't Let Your Son Grow Up To Be A Cowboy: Unreleased Recordings. Lineups The band has gone through several lineup changes from 1980 to 1986: ;Jazzateers v1 (1980‚Äì1981) Alison Gourlay (vocals) Ian Burgoyne (guitar) Keith Band (bass) Colin Auld (drums) Don't Let Your Son Grow Up To Be A Cowboy Some tracks were produced by Edwyn Collins, including a version of Donna Summers' \\"Wasted\\" which was scheduled to be a single on Postcard. Another (unreleased) version of \\"Wasted\\" was produced by Pete Bellote. ;Jazzateers v2 (1982) Dee Rutkowski (vocals) Louise Rutkowski (vocals) Paul Quinn (vocals) Ian Burgoyne (guitar, vocals) Keith Band (bass) Colin Auld (drums) Jazzateers 2 recorded an album ('Lee') produced by Alan Horne which has yet to be released. ;Jazzateers v3 (1983) Grahame Skinner (vocals) Ian Burgoyne (guitar) Keith Band (bass) Colin Auld (drums) Paul Quinn (backing vocals) Jazzateers 3 signed to Rough Trade. \\"Show Me The Door\\"/\\"16 Reasons\\" was released as a single swiftly followed by the eponymously titled album, which received excellent reviews. Shortly afterwards, they were joined by Mick Slaven on lead guitar with Paul Quinn taking over on lead vocals. They reverted to the name Bourgie Bourgie, whilst Skinner started a new group with Douglas MacIntyre called White Savages. Jazzateers had been booked to appear on a UK television show, The Switch on back of the press acclaim the group were getting for their Rough Trade album. Instead they appeared on The Switch as Bourgie Bourgie (performing \\"Show Me The Door\\" and \\"16 Reasons\\"), and shortly afterwards were being courted by several major labels in the UK. Bourgie Bourgie eventually signed to MCA (with Kenny MacDonald replacing Colin Auld on drums) and released two singles, \\"Breaking Point\\" and \\"Careless\\". An album was also recorded, but unreleased.

It replaces the shortly sold Samyang 14mm f/2.8 IF ED MC Aspherical. Description The Samyang 14mm is sold for many different SLR lens mounts and thus its dimensions vary accordingly. Lens mounts with shorter flange focal distances are longer and heavier. As a manual focus only lens, it does not support auto focus. It also has an aperture ring which manually adjusts the aperture with half-stop clicks. This has enabled the manufacturer to produce a lens of surprising quality while remaining several times cheaper than equivalent lenses from either Nikon or Canon. It is one of the widest non-fisheye prime lenses. While the lens has some level of mustache distortion, it is able to offer superior levels of resolution compared to the Nikon AF-S 14-24mm 2.8G. Also, while it has a fair level of vignetting like most other wide angle lenses, it manages to keep chromatic aberration levels to a minimum. The hood of the lens is fixed and the front element protrudes extensively, forcing the lens cap to take an unconventional shape, covering the entire hood. This also does not allow the placing of a filter in the front. The lens contains one glass aspherical element and one hybrid aspherical element. It is also sold under a number of different brands such as Rokinon, Vivitar and Bower. Samyang has announced the AE version of the lens for Nikon which includes a CPU and electronic contacts to allow for automatic exposure in all modes, including in camera models that do not normally support automatic exposure with manual focus Nikon Ai lenses. The AE version became available on the 28th of December 2010 with the suggested retail price of 389 EUR.

Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, she was born into a wealthy professional Danish family. After studies at the Royal Academy of Art in the 1880s, she pursued a successful career as an illustrator and writer, working with a number of publishing firms including J.M. Dent and Macmillan, and jointly publishing travel books with Janet Ross, a prominent member of the Anglo-Tuscan pre-War community. In July 2018 \\"Nelly Erichsen - A Hidden Life\\", a biography of Erichsen by Sarah Harkness was published.https://www.encantapublishing.com/publications  Biography = Family history  Anna Dorothea Erichsen with her children Nelly Erichsen was born on 9 December 1862 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the fourth of six children. Her father was Herman Gustav Erichsen, born in Copenhagen in October 1826 who, after a ‚Äòcommercial education‚Äô and travelling in Europe, came to Newcastle as a young man of just 22. Nelly‚Äôs mother, Anna Dorothea Suhr, who was also born in Denmark, in 1827, was the sister of Ole Berendt Suhr. Erichsen and her cousin Ida Marie Suhr in 1884 In the late 1860s Herman, originally a general trader, invested in the formation of the Great Northern Telegraph Company and became that company‚Äôs representative in England until the time of his death, moving his family to live in Tooting, South London. Herman was a successful businessman, with shareholdings in other telegraph businesses and companies in his native Denmark. He died on 6 December 1889 at the age of 63. Nelly Erichsen was fluent in Danish and kept a close relationship to her parents' home country. Her sister Alice Erichsen was a translator of Danish literature into English.  Artistic career  In the 1881 census, Erichsen, aged 19, is described as an art student at the Royal Academy Schools, though before the institution had any permanent lecturers. Her first student exhibit at the Royal Academy was in 1884, entitled The Deserted Homestead. Whilst a student, she resided on New Court, Lincoln‚Äôs Inn, London, (now Carey Street within the London School of Economics campus) and the Royal Academy exhibited four more of her works in 1885: * A Descendant of the Danes * No truly, she is too disdainful * Briars and Brambles * A Study Erichsen quickly gained some financial independence as a professional artist, including commissions to produce illustrations accompanying short stories in the English Illustrated Magazine. By 1890, she was working from Trafalgar Studios on Manresa Road in Chelsea. Those studios later became part of the South-Western Polytechnic Institute and Day School, a forerunner of the Chelsea College of Art and Design. In 1893 Erichsen exhibited a painting at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition entitled Phyllis. Erichsen's painting The Orchard was reviewed in The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs. Other paintings from this time included The Magic Crystal, which showed Pre-Raphaelite influences. At this time, Erichsen was friends with Bertha Newcombe, a member of the Fabian Society, and it was through her that she met George Bernard Shaw, playwright and co-founder of the London School of Economics. In 1894 Erichsen engraved plates for a J.M. Dent limited edition of the novels of the Scottish author Susan Edmonstone Ferrier. From 1891 to 1897 Erichsen was a consistent contributor to the Royal Academy exhibitions, including the following works: * The Magic Crystal (1891) * Out of the deep have I cried unto thee (1892) * The Emperor‚Äôs New Clothes (1897) Erichsen's works occasionally appear at auction. The highest recorded price for an Erichsen was paid at Sothebys in 2009 for the large oil \\"Going Home\\" which sold for ¬£23,750.http://www.sothebys.com/ru/auctions/ecatalogue/2009/victorian- edwardian-art-l09688/lot.77.html By 1900 Erichsen was living in Italy. She is one of two illustrators, with M Helen James, for The Story of Assisi, by Lina Duff Gordon, published by J.M. Dent and printed by Turnbull and Spears, Edinburgh. The following year, she contributed to Florentine Villas by Janet Ross, Duff Gordon's aunt. Also in 1901, she was the sole illustrator for The Story of Rome, written by Norwood Young, another in the J.M. Dent series. This series proved very popular ‚Äì The Story of Rome reached its fifth edition in 1905, and The Story of Assisi remained in print until at least 1909 and remains available today in reproduction hardcover form. In 1903 Erichsen worked with Edmund Gardner on The Story of Florence. Five years later she illustrated The Highways and Byways of Derbyshire, written by J.B. Firth. She is credited in the book's preface: \\"I am also more particularly indebted to Miss Erichsen not only for the charm of her illustrations but for numerous interesting details relating to persons and places\\". September 1909 saw Erichsen residing in Chipping Campden. She joined a community of craftsmen that was gathering there under the leadership of C.R. Ashbee ‚Äì a well-known Chelsea architect, with some of his best work in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, who was also a designer of metalwork and jewelry, a poet and writer. He was a founder of the Essex House Press, inspired by William Morris‚Äô Kelmscott Press. Chipping Campden was associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement from 1902 when Ashbee moved there with the Guild and School of Handicraft which he had founded in 1888. In particular, Erichsen was likely drawn there through an association with F. L. Griggs, one of the foremost illustrators and etchers of his day. Griggs was one of the first etchers to be elected to fellowship of the Royal Academy and like Erichsen was an illustrator for the Macmillan Highways and Byways Series.  Final years in Italy  Cimitero Inglese, Bagni di Lucca, Nelly Erichsen (1862‚Äì1918) From 1912 until November 1918, Erichsen was living in the quiet Tuscan spa town of Bagni di Lucca with two companions, Evangeline Marrs Whipple and Rose Cleveland. Whipple was the widow of the American Episcopal Bishop Henry Whipple, known for his evangelical work among the native Indian population. Rose Cleveland was the youngest sister of Grover Cleveland, President of the United States. Rose served as her brother's First Lady 1885‚Äì1886 before Cleveland married. Whipple and Cleveland had first met in the winter of 1889‚Äì1890, and resumed their romantic relationship in 1901 (after the death of Henry Whipple), moving from the US to Italy in 1910. During the First World War, and especially after the intervention of the United States, the three women became organisers of aid work for the families of soldiers, particularly after the huge losses of the Battle of Caporetto (now Kobarid, Slovenia) in 1917. A penniless group of refugees was invited to Bagni di Lucca, and Whipple organized and financed a boarding school for their children under the auspices of the Stigmatine Sisters, which took in around one hundred children. In 1918 both Rose Cleveland and Nelly Erichsen were killed by the 1918 flu pandemic which decimated the post-war world. Evangeline Whipple died in London in 1930, but she was laid to rest in Bagni di Lucca next to the tombs of the two friends who had preceded her.

Personal Dick Haugland was born in Huron, South Dakota. His parents were Elizabeth M. (Steuber) Haugland and Nelvin E. Haugland. He has one sister, Barbara A. (Haugland) Felker, who lives in Bloomington, Minnesota. Richard Haugland received all of his primary and secondary school education in Faribault, Minnesota. He graduated number four in his high school class of 192 students in June 1961 and enrolled at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota. At Hamline University he majored in chemistry. He received a B.S. degree cum laude with distinction in chemistry in June 1965. In September 1965 Richard Haugland became a graduate student in the chemistry department of Stanford University. His Ph.D. advisor was Dr. Lubert Stryer, a prominent biophysicist. His research at Stanford was a combination of organic synthesis of novel fluorescent dyes and experimental proofs of the theory of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), a physical effect that permits measurement of distances in the range of the size of proteins. Two classic papers resulted from this collaboration: 1\\\\. Stryer, L., Haugland, R.P. \\"Energy Transfer: A Spectroscopic Ruler.\\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 58, 719‚Äì726 (1967). 2\\\\.

Richard Haugland dropped out of graduate school from April 1967 to June 1968 to serve as a volunteer in the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program (now called AmeriCorps VISTA). His service was in the L‚ÄôAnse‚ÄìBaraga area of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in an American Indian (Chippewa/Ojibwe) area. He completed his research at Stanford University in December 1968 and worked for eight months as a chemist at Syntex in Palo Alto CA. He left Syntex and in December 1969 moved into an abandoned cabin at Bad Medicine Lake near Park Rapids, Minnesota. While in the cabin, he finished writing his Ph.D. thesis by the light of a kerosene lamp. He received his Ph.D. degree from Stanford University in June 1970. In March to June 1970 he was an unpaid volunteer at Pine Point Elementary School in Ponsford, Minnesota where he taught grades five and six. During the following school year and part of the subsequent school year he taught mathematics to the American Indian (Chippewa/Ojibwe) children in the school and developed basic mathematics instructional materials. In June 1972 he became a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Manuel Morales, a biophysicist in the Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) at the University of California, San Francisco. While there, he continued the synthesis of novel fluorescent dyes and did fluorescence-based studies of contractile proteins. He met Dr. Rosaria P. Brivio, a biochemistry postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Manuel Morales at the CVRI and they were married on November 22, 1972. They have two children, Marina Elizabeth Haugland Martin, born August 29, 1975, who is a medical doctor now at Stanford University, and Alexander David Haugland, born October 20, 1976, who now lives in Eugene, Oregon. Richard Haugland returned to be an assistant professor of chemistry at Hamline University from September 1975 to June 1978. While there, he taught organic chemistry and general chemistry. His previous professors while a Hamline University student (Drs. Olaf Runquist, Rodney Olson and Clifford Creswell) were now his colleagues. During his first year as a professor at Hamline University, Richard and Rosaria Haugland founded Molecular Probes. Richard Haugland received an outstanding achievement award from Hamline University in 1998 and Richard and Rosaria Haugland each received honorary doctorates from Hamline University in June 2006. He died on October 5, 2016 from brain cancer in Thailand, where he resided. Molecular Probes Molecular Probes was founded by Drs. Richard and Rosaria Haugland while Richard Haugland was an assistant professor of chemistry at Hamline University. The intention of Molecular Probes was to make available for research purposes fluorescent dyes that would be of utility for biomedical research applications and that were not available from other sources. The company relocated from Roseville, Minnesota to Plano, Texas in July 1978 where it was incorporated. Molecular Probes remained in Plano until it moved to a remote site in the woods outside Junction City, Oregon in July 1982. Molecular Probes relocated into the city of Eugene, Oregon in 1988 where it remains today. Richard Haugland was president, research director and marketing director of Molecular Probes Inc. until August 2002 and then Corporate Research Director until August 2003 when Molecular Probes was sold to Invitrogen of Carlsbad, California. Invitrogen was subsequently sold to Thermo-Fisher Scientific in April 2013. While at Molecular Probes, Richard Haugland was a named inventor on approximately 80 United States patents and their numerous foreign patent equivalents. He also published approximately 150 scientific papers in chemistry, biochemistry and biophysics. At Molecular Probes, Richard Haugland authored the first nine editions of the Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals, which became the ‚Äúbible‚Äù for researchers in the field of fluorescence. On April 24, 2002, Drs. Richard Haugland and Lubert Stryer received the 2002 Molecular Bioanalytic award sponsored by Roche Diagnostics GmbH in association with the German Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (GBM). The award was for their ‚ÄúOutstanding achievements in the field of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The core of this work was principally accomplished while Richard Haugland was a graduate student at Stanford University but both Drs. Haugland and Stryer made additional contributions to the technology subsequent to those years. US Foundations and their Philanthropic Activities Drs. Richard and Rosaria Haugland started the Haugland Foundation in 1998 to fund charitable activities in health, education and cultural areas. Most of the funds for the Haugland Foundation came from the profits of Molecular Probes. The Haugland Foundation and Molecular Probes became major sponsors of cultural activities in the Eugene OR area including the Eugene Ballet, Eugene Opera, Oregon Contemporary Theater and other local groups. The foundation also supported Hamline University, the University of Oregon, Lane Community College and several other programs. When Molecular Probes was sold to Invitrogen in August 2003, the Haugland Foundation was renamed the Richard P. Haugland Foundation and half the assets of the original Haugland Foundation were transferred to the new Rosaria P. Haugland Foundation. The Rosaria P. Haugland Foundation continues to support programs that are mostly in the Eugene, Oregon area but the Richard P. Haugland Foundation now concentrates its funding on support of programs in Asia, particularly in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, The Philippines and India. In 2003, Richard Haugland also started a directed fund that is administered by the Oregon Community Foundation. The money in this fund is principally used to make annual unrestricted grants to Hamline University and to continue to support the Eugene Ballet, Eugene Opera, Oregon Contemporary Theater, Skipping Stones, Womenspace and HIV Alliance in Eugene, Oregon. In December 2008, Richard Haugland gave approximately $10.4 million to start the new International Medica Foundation. The objective of the International Medica Foundation is to reintroduce a vaccine for rotavirus, a virus that causes severe diarrhea and kills approximately 600,000 children a year worldwide. The International Medica Foundation has conducted a major clinical trial of this vaccine in Ghana. From 2013 the Richard P. Haugland Foundation has supported education and healthcare related programs in Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, India, Bangladesh and Nepal through the Firetree Asia Foundation, helping over 300,000 children. e Firetree Asia Foundation, which ensures effective due diligence on the organizations supported and provides strategic and technical support to ensure the effectiveness of the programs. The Richard P. Haugland Foundation was dissolved in early 2017 and its assets transferred to two successor foundations: the Starfish Education Foundation, which will continue supporting education programs in Thailand through the management of schools and learning centres as well as the development of curricula and solution to improve the professional development of educators, and the Tondo Foundation, which will carry on Richard's legacy by building solutions to the education, healthcare and protection problems faced by children and youth living in Asia. Thailand and Early Education Curriculum Development RHAUGLAND.theoraFollowing sale of Molecular Probes to Invitrogen in August 2003, Richard Haugland spent much of 2004 in Thailand where he volunteered at Moo Baan Dek, a home and school for orphans and needy children located west of Kanchanaburi, which is northwest of Bangkok. During that period, he was also a consultant for Invitrogen/Molecular Probes. His interest in Thailand started with a family trip to Thailand with a Stanford University Alumni Association group in 1988. He and Rosaria Haugland sponsored foster children in the poor northeast Thailand region (Isan) and in other countries for almost 40 years through Plan International and he had visited these Thai foster children almost annually. Based on his experience and interests in early childhood education that extended back to his days as a volunteer at Pine Point Indian School (1970 to 1972), Richard Haugland decided to develop unique multi-media teaching methods and materials. This interest eventually resulted in curriculum development for teaching of mathematics and the English (Thaiglish) and Thai languages to preschool and primary school children.

Life and education Borromeo was born in Genoa, the daughter of duke Marcantonio of Mondragone and Maria Antonia Imperial. Borromeo was educated in several languages, mathematics, natural science and mechanics. She spoke eight languages and was interested in geometry, natural science and mathematics. She was educated first by her mother and then in a convent, but it is unknown where she received education in the subjects she became known for. In 1707, she married count Giovanni Borromeo Arese Benedict (1679‚Äì1744), and became the mother of eight children. Borromeo died in Milan. Contributions She was famous for her ability to solve every mathematical problem presented to her. Borromeo was described as an independent person, which was regarded as eccentric because it was not considered natural for her gender. She was criticized for entertaining many scientists, both foreign and Italian, who were known as atheists. One of her guests was Antonio Vallisneri (1661‚Äì1733). She founded the academy nell'Academia Vigilantium Clelia in her salon in Milan, which was active in 1719‚Äì1726. During the war in 1746, Borromeo took the side of Spain against Austria and was therefore exiled. When she was allowed to return to Milan, she was celebrated as a heroine. In 1728, Borromeo discovered the so-called Cl√©lie curve : q = m∆í. When the longitude and colatitude of a point P on a sphere are denoted by q and ∆í and if P moves so that q = m∆í, where m is a constant, then the locus of P is called a cl√©lie. Recognition The city of Genoa honored her with a medal with the inscription Genuensium Gloria (The Honor of Genoa).

His playing was influenced by Junior Wells, Jimmy Reed, Little Walter, Lazy Lester, and Little Sonny. Biography Born Thaddeus Louis Hall, in Oakland, California, Shah also spent time in Somerville, Texas, with his blues harmonica and guitar playing grandfather, Sam Dawson. Dawson had recorded for both Alan Lomax and Duke Records. His mother, a beautician, encouraged him to be a salesman for Jet magazine in the latter part of the 1950s. This allowed Shah access to Oakland's bars and clubs, where he heard musicians such as Lowell Fulson, Jimmy McCracklin, Juke Boy Bonner and Big Mama Thornton. Shah told Living Blues magazine that his grandfather's passion for the blues inspired him. \\"Well see I picked it up from him, he'd be out in the fields singin' all that (sings in a slow moan) 'Tell me how long, whoa, tell me how long it's been since you've been away from home' Well, that's raw! That's a big damn difference from 'Good Golly Miss Molly'\\". He moved to Detroit in 1967, and worked for Ford Motors for fifteen years. Shah bought himself a cheap harmonica in 1976 and, while operating as a taxicab driver, Shah was introduced to local blues jam sessions. \\"Hell, that was it, no turning back then\\", Shah recalled. Over the years, Shah has played alongside Bobo Jenkins, Eddie Kirkland, The Butler Twins and Willie D. Warren. His debut album, Motor City Mojo was released by Blue Suit Records in 2000. His 2006 album, Listen at Me Good, was recorded in Toronto, and included contributions from the Blues Music Award winners Mel Brown on guitar, and Willie \\"Big Eyes\\" Smith playing the drums, along with Julian Fauth on piano. He has toured across the United States, as well as in Europe, Russia, Japan and Australia. Closer to his roots, Shah still occasionally performs for free at John's Carpet House in East Detroit. He legally changed his birth name to Seward Shah. Shah's more recent release was the 2009 album, If All You Have Is a Hammer, on his current record label, Electro-Fi Records.

In December 1988 Schabort re-launched the BBB as the Blanke Nasionale Beweging (White National Movement) under the nominal leadership of Wynand de Beer; however as its activities were clearly the same as the BBB it was banned in the beginning of 1989.

Tauris (2004) p96 Some members of the BBB like Keith Conroy would go on to support the Afrikaner Volksfront. Later events A few members, led by Jean Pierre du Plessis, sought to continue the BBB, with the BBB as the political wing to which would be added an underground organisation called the National Socialist Partisans (NSP). Schabort chose not to become involved.Truth and Reconcilliation Amnesty Hearings Du Plessis continued to form the NSP as a cell ; its flag was \\"basically white with a red cross and a swastika\\". NSP members were arrested in 1991 for the murder of three black people at Louis Trichardt. Following a bombing of a taxi rank in Germiston on 26 April 1994 which killed ten people it was claimed in the press that the BBB were responsible; Schabort denied the BBB was responsible Ideology The Truth and Reconciliation Commission described the BBB's ideology as \\"refined nazism\\".Truth and Reconcilliation Commission report Vol 6, section 3, chapter 6 pp445-446 Schabort himself described the organisation as \\"openly racist\\". It was white supremacist and against race mixing. The BBB regarded blacks as 'mud people' or 'mud race'. The BBB sought the 'repatriation' (expulsion) of blacks from South Africa, \\"by violence if necessary\\". It was openly anti-semitic, regarding Jews as existing between white and blacks, and denied the Holocaust.Visser, Myda Marista Die Ideologiese Grondslae En Ontwikkeling Van Die Blanke Fascistiese Bewegings In Suid-Afrika, 1945- 1995 (The ideological foundations and development of white fascist movements in South Africa, 1945-1999) M.A. Thesis University of Pretoria (1999) p161 The BBB was against democracy and sought a new economic order.

History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in 1723 during his first year in Leipzig for the 21st Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, \\"take unto you the whole armour of God\\" (), and from the Gospel of John, the healing of the nobleman's son (). The unknown poet of the cantata text stressed the faith, which made the healing possible. The cantata opens with a quote from the Gospel of Mark, The possessed boy, Mark's rendition of the gospel (). The following movements almost form a dialogue between fear and hope, or belief and doubt, such as Bach would compose three weeks later in O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60, and again for Easter of 1724 in Erfreut euch, ihr Herzen, BWV 66. Movement 2 is a dialogue, movement 3 the expression of fear, movements 4 and 5 turn to hope. The closing chorale is verse 7 of \\"\\" by Lazarus Spengler (1524). Bach first performed the cantata on 17 October 1723.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for alto and tenor soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of cor du chasse (corno da caccia or corno da tirarsi), two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The cor du chasse is possibly the same instrument as the slide trumpet used a week before in the performance in Leipzig of the cantata Ach! ich sehe, itzt, da ich zur Hochzeit gehe, BWV 162, written in Weimar. Its added part is not in the score. In the opening chorus it plays mostly colla parte with the first violin, in movement 6 the cantus firmus with the soprano. # Chorus: # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor, strings): # Recitative (alto): # Aria (alto, oboes): # Chorale:  Music  The opening chorus shows many elements of a concerto grosso. In the instrumental ritornello, oboe 1 and violin 1 form the concertino. The vocal parts appear sometimes as a solo or duet, expressing belief in an upward theme derived from the ritornello theme, with doubt expressed in a downward line. The inner dialogue in movement 2 is marked forte and piano, rather than giving the words to two different singers, as John Eliot Gardiner points out: \\"Bach reinforces the dichotomy between faith and doubt by assigning two opposing voices sung by the same singer, one marked forte, the other piano, alternating phrase by phrase and surely unique in Bach's recitatives\\". The final question \\"\\" (Ah, Lord, how long?) is intensified as an arioso, marked adagio. In the following aria fear is expressed, according to Gardiner, in \\"jagged melodic shapes, unstable harmonies headed towards anguished second inversion chords, and persistent dotted rhythmic figures\\". It has been compared to the tenor aria from Bach's St John Passion, . The closing chorale is not a four-part setting, but a complex chorale fantasia with an independent orchestral part, in which the choral part is embedded. The lines of the chorale melody \\"\\", interspersed by interludes, are sung in long notes by the soprano (with the corno) on a foundation of faster movement in the lower voices. This movement is the first chorale fantasia written in a Bach cantata in Leipzig, to be followed by many such movements opening chorale cantatas of the second cantata cycle.

He went on partner with John Rockefeller in 1856, forming a grain and produce business that grew with the addition of several other partners to be Clark, Rockefeller, & Co in 1864. During the American Civil War (1863), the two partners went into the oil business. Eventually, Rockefeller bought Clark's (and his brothers') share of the company at auction for $72,500. Following this, Clark went on to start another oil company, the Star Oil company, which passed through several names and changes of partner, becoming Clark Brothers & Co, and Clark, Payne, & Co. In 1868, he joined new partners to form the Clark, Schurmer, & Scofield Company, which then became Clark, Scofield, and Teagle. Following his work in the oil industry, he helped to organize the Cleveland Co-operative Stove Company. At the time of his death, he presided over the board of directors and he had been the company's president for twenty years.

The majority of the people of Indian descent in the Netherlands are of Indo- Surinamese origin. More recently the flow of emigrants from India has increased, especially information technology professionals.  History  In 2017, 8,630 Indians immigrated to the Netherlands, making them the second largest recent immigrant group after the Syrians. Most of them were highly skilled migrants working in information technology and information services. Moreover, the number of Indians who came to study in the Netherlands has more than tripled: from 425 migrant students in 2012 to 1,400 migrant students in 2017. Between January and November 2019, 6,322 Indians immigrated to the Netherlands. Nevertheless, Indian migrants often stay in the Netherlands temporarily, as about 45% leave the country within six years. As of 2019, about 48,724 people of Indian immigrant descent lived in the Netherlands. Most of them live in the provinces of North Holland, South Holland and North Brabant. Most notable is the Indian presence in Amstelveen, where 5,629 of the approximately 90,000 inhabitants are Indian (6%).  Indo-Surinamese  After the abolition of slavery in the Dutch colony of Suriname, the Dutch government signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers. Indians began migrating to Suriname in 1873 from what was then British India as indentured labourers, mostly from the modern-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the surrounding regions. Up until the independence of Suriname in 1975, all the Indo-Surinamese were formally part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and thus owned a Dutch passport. After the independence a significant portion of the Indo-Surinamese population migrated to the Netherlands, thereby retaining their Dutch passport. Currently there are more than 120,000 Indo-Surinamese living in the Netherlands, of which the majority, about 50,000, in The Hague and surroundings. Indo-Surinamese are also known in both the Netherlands and Suriname by the Dutch term Hindoestanen, derived from the word Hindustani, lit., \\"someone from Hindustan\\". Hence, when Indians migrated to Suriname they were referred to as Hindustanis, people of Indian origin. Statistics In December 2001 the High Level Committee on Indian Diaspora estimated the population of PIO's and Indian citizens at 215,000.Report of the High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora December 2001. According to the Dutch governmental institution Statistics Netherlands (CBS), in January 2016, 32,682 people had their origin from immigrants from India.

It was also on a Your Sinclair magazine cover tape. Description In-game screenshot (ZX Spectrum) Tomcat is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player takes control of an F14 Tomcat fighter aircraft, shooting at both air and ground targets whilst flying over four levels. The game is set in the future, some time after the first half of the 21st century. In the in-game universe, materials science has progressed such that human civilisation has found a way to cheaply build many artificial islands. The game is set on one such island, called ARTROCK 6 which is a completely automated defence installation. Due to a freak storm damaging the controlling software, the island has turned against its own side and has started attacking local shipping. The player's task is to fly in and completely destroy the rogue island. Reception Reviews are generally negative, citing a slow running speed, an overly high difficulty level and a lack of originality. Reviewers independently agree that the game has a major flaw in that the enemy bullets are incredibly difficult to see, being the same colour as the background graphics in many versions. The game has also been criticised for having a weak aeroplane theme as it's simply a fixed-speed vertical scroller which could just as easily have a spaceship or any such sprite in its place.

Life and career  Eberhard Achterberg joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party in February 1930,Christine Koch, Das Bibliothekswesen im Nationalsozialismus: eine Forschungsstandanalyse, Marburg: Tectum, 2003, , p. 14. and was also in the SA. From 1934 to 1936 he contributed to Bernhard Kummer's journal Nordische Stimmen. In 1935, his \\"Germanische Religion im Streit der Gegenwart\\" was published. He received his doctorate in 1940 from the University of Jena with a dissertation entitled Gl√ºck und Schicksal im germanischen Lebensgef√ºhl. Eine Untersuchung √ºber Art, Vorkommen und Bedeutung der altnordischen Worte f√ºr Gl√ºck und Schicksal in den Islendinga s√∂gur. At the end of that year he became acting editor of Nationalsozialistische Monatshefte, published by Alfred Rosenberg, which described itself as the \\"central political and cultural periodical of the NSDAP\\". From July 1941, he was editor in chief. Rosenberg placed Achterberg in his department, the \\"Amt Rosenberg', whose official mission was to oversee all intellectual and ideological training and education in the Nazi Party.Heinrich Beck and Johannes Hoops, eds.

He based his journalistic work for the German Unitarians on a new approach which was strongly influenced by Albert Schweitzer. Achterberg had an important influence on Unitarian thought in GermanyOskar Hegels, unit√§rische bl√§tter issue 4, 1986, p. 163. and was an \\"outstanding exponent\\" of Unitarianism,Peter Bahn in the brochure Bausteine 1, Schriften zur Grundlegung Unitarischer Religiosit√§t. Ad Fontes; Zu den Quellen, ed. Bund Deutscher Unitarier, 1991, p. 6. and for 14 years was the editor of the periodical Glaube und Tat--Deutsch-unitarische Bl√§tter (now unitarische bl√§tter), where he primarily concerned himself with issues raising questions about value orientation, anti-authoritarian education, social policy and personal interactions. Later, he was the spokesman for the public body Deutsche Unitarier Religionsgemeinschaft for the state of Schleswig-Holstein. He lost a teaching position in German and philosophy at the Armed Forces University in Hamburg when one of his sons refused military service. In the 1970s he taught at the vocational college in Pl√∂n. In 1983, shortly before his death, Achterberg was elected \\"Head of the Spiritual Council\\" of the German Unitarians.

It is bounded by the River Ouse from Scarborough Bridge to Ouse Acres on its northern boundary. Its western boundary is formed by one side of Carr Lane and Ouse Acres to the junction of York Road/Acomb Road, which forms part of the southern boundary. The remainder of the southern boundary follows Moorgate and Holgate Beck to the East Coast Main Line railway which completes the eastern boundary as far as the River Ouse/Scarborough Bridge. It contains the National Railway Museum and many historic buildings, including a restored 18th century windmill and a Cold War bunker. It is the site of the former ABB York carriageworks which closed in 1996. A US owned rail company, Thrall Europa, briefly re-opened the works. After that closed in 2002 Network Rail continue to use it as a maintenance depot. History Holgate Windmill in November 2009 Holgate is mentioned in chronicles as far back as the 14th century. There are many historic buildings within its boundaries, including a restored windmill. The Holgate Mill sits on Windmill Rise. The current windmill, built in 1770 by George Waud, ceased grinding corn in 1933 and fell into disuse. It has since undergone restoration work overseen by the Holgate windmill Association. There is also mention of a Hob Moor Water Mill located on Holgate Beck, reportedly demolished or fallen in disrepair by 1723. The York New Waterworks Company, formed in 1846, built their new works at Acomb Landing, just off Boroughbridge Road. It supplied the city of York, Holgate and other nearby areas and although the site has since expanded, it still serves the area as The York Waterworks Company. Holgate Villa In 1843, it was recorded that the population of Holgate was a mere 143. The population of Holgate increased with the building of the Carriageworks in the late 19th century. For much of its history, Holgate had been considered a township of nearby Acomb being a part of the manor of Acomb. The city boundary of York was expanded by local legislation, in 1884, to include Holgate. Holgate was home to No. 20 Group Royal Observer Corps located in a semi-subterranean bunker built in 1961. It was in use until 1991 and situated behind the Government Building of Shelley House, which has now been redeveloped into residential properties. It has been preserved as a museum by English Heritage working with the York ROC Association and the Cold War Bunker Trust, having been granted Scheduled Ancient Monument status in 2000. Politics Holgate Ward returns three councillors to the City of York Council. As of 2017, it is represented by Mary Cannon, Fiona Derbyshire and Kallum Taylor, all of whom represent the local Labour Party. Holgate is situated in the UK parliamentary constituency of York Central and the EU region of Yorkshire and Humberside. Its current MP is Rachael Maskell, a Labour Co-operative member. While it is represented by the MEPs: Richard Corbett (Labour), Amjad Bashir (Conservative), John Procter (Conservative), Linda McAvan (Labour), Mike Hookem (UKIP) and Jane Collins (UKIP). Demographics The figures below were taken from the Census 2001 Key Statistics for Local Authorities in England and Wales, from the Office for National Statistics on 29 April 2001. The population in Holgate Ward was 11,564 of which 92.3% were born in England and 3.8% from outside the United Kingdom. The largest Age Group within the population, 25.1%, were between 30 and 44 years old. Of the total population, 95.9% described their ethnic origin as White-British. The figures show that 72.3% declared they were Christian, whilst 18.6% declared no religious belief at all. Of the population aged between 16 and 74 years old, 69.1% declared they were in some form of employment and 12.1% said they were retired. Of the 5,311 households, 34.6% were Semi-Detached and 47.9% were Terraced. The level of household ownership was 73.5%. The population according to the 2011 UK Census had risen to 12,832 for the Holgate ward. Public services Fire Station on Boroughbridge Road Located on Acomb Road is the Police Station for the Acomb and Holgate Team of the North Yorkshire and City of York Police Force. North Yorkshire Fire & Rescue Service operate a 24/7 shift out of the Acomb Fire Station on Boroughbridge Road. Geography Bowling Greens at West Bank Park The geographic area of Holgate is taken up mostly by domestic and industrial buildings with large areas of railway track. There are some open areas, one of which is West Bank Park. This is managed by the City Council and consists of 20 acres containing woodlands and an arboretum, as well as two bowling greens, a basketball court, two play areas, toilets and a refreshments building. Entrances are on Hamilton Drive and Acomb Road. The park, originally the grounds of West Bank house, was established in 1936‚Äì38 and included a statue of Queen Victoria that was originally in the Guildhall. There are six smaller play areas around the ward. There is also some open space alongside the river. Economy Holgate Bridge In 1880 the North Eastern Railway decided to concentrate more on carriage building in York by constructing a new works factory in Holgate. This expanded and by 1910 it covered an area of 45 acres. By 1855 the railway workforce was 1,200-strong and was calculated to be earning about ¬£1,350 a week for the city‚Äôs economy. At the beginning of the 20th century, York had around 5,500 railway employees, of which half were employed in the wagon and carriage works. The works closed in 1996. Part of the site is now office accommodation for various companies, such as CPP. Carriage Works A large part of the works was retained and used by Thrall to build wagons for EWS. When this ceased Network Rail took over and has developed a maintenance facility, servicing amongst other things the rail head treatment trains. Separately the wagon works off Cinder Lane have been developed by Freightliner as an important maintenance depot for their mineral carrying wagons. There are small groupings of retail shops and stores throughout the Holgate area. Education English Martyr's Roman Catholic Voluntary Aided Primary in Hamilton Drive was originally located in Blossom Street and opened in March 1882. Acomb Primary in West Bank was originally located on Front Street and opened in August 1894. It was one of the oldest primary schools in North Yorkshire and had been in its old buildings since 1908 and was the second largest primary school in York, with 575 pupils. Poppleton Road Primary is located at the junction of Poppleton road and Water Lane. St Barnabas' Church of England Primary is located in Jubilee Terrace just off Leeman Road and opened in 1877. St Paul's Church of England Primary is located in St Paul's Terrace, not far from the Church of the same name and opened in 1872. There is no Secondary School within Holgate. Sports York Railway Institute Football Club play their home games at New Lane. York RI have a reasonable history in non-league football as they once played in the Northern Counties East Football League. Rugby and Hockey are also catered for at the Railway Institute with this being the home ground for York Lokomotive who play in the Rugby League Conference Yorkshire Premier Division. Religion Holgate Methodist Church, Acomb Road There are five main places of worship in Holgate. They are St Paul's Church on Holgate Road, Holgate Methodist Church on Acomb Road, St Barnabas Parish Church on Jubilee Terrace and the Church of the Holy Redeemer on Boroughbridge Road and the York congregation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) on Acomb Road. St Paul's Church was built in 1851 to cater to the increasing population of railway workers in the area and became the seat of its own parish in 1856. St Barnabas, built between 1902 and 1904, became its own parish in 1912, being formerly under St Paul's. Notable residents Lindley Murray, the noted grammarian, settled in Holgate after going into exile following the American War of Independence.

Jwalapuram is of particular importance in understanding the emergence of microlithic technology in South Asia and the role of environmental change on lithic technological change. At Jwalapuram Locality 9, five stratigraphic units provide a record of technological change through time. Microblade technology dominates lithic assemblages from Stratum E to the top deposit. There are many different definitions for \\"microblade\\" and Clarkson et al. define microblade with a 40mm maximum length in the direction of striking and a length:width ratio greater than 2:1; they also include that the dorsal surface has nearly no cortex (less than 20 percent) and at least on dorsal ridge in the direction of striking as well as nearly parallel lateral margins. Using this definition of microblade, Clarkson et al. track the changing density of microblade technology throughout the strata. The changes in microlithic technology is speculated to have been caused by climate change, which made the area more arid and therefore groups of people had to become more mobile, causing changes in their technological tool kits.Clarkson, C., Petraglia, M., Korisettar, R., Haslam, M., Boivin, N., Crowther, A., Ditchfield, P., Fuller, D., Miracle, P., Harris, C., Connell, K., James, H. & Koshy, J. 2009.

Born in Arenberg-Immendorf he died in Vallendar, Rhineland- Palatinate, Germany. Life & career Born the son of a coachman in Arenberg- Immendorf, Prussia, Ackermann attended primary and commercial trade school from 1911 to 1919. After joining the Nazi party in 1925, he later became the Gauredner (). After the Nazis seized power in 1936, Ackermann became Regional Inspector in the Koblenz-Trier area under Gauleiter Gustav Simon, and in 1942 in the Mosel district. After the occupation of Luxembourg by German troops in May 1940, Simon, in addition to Gauleiter, was named the Head of Civil Administration (CDZ) in Luxembourg. He took Ackermann with him to be part of his staff. Ackermann was a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA), where he became SA-Oberf√ºhrer on November 9, 1938 and was promoted to the rank of SA- Brigadef√ºhrer on November 9, 1943. On December 9, 1941, Ackermann became the successor in the Reichstag to Detlef Dern for the seat from Neuwied. In the spring of 1945, Ackermann and his wife fled to an air raid shelter in Arenberg that had spots reserved for Nazi Party members. A one-legged German soldier, who had recently been at the military hospital, became upset that Ackermann would be permitted entrance and protested. Ackermann punched the soldier in response. Angered by this, the shelter attendees refused entry to Ackermann and his wife.http://www.arenberg-info.de/htm/K-Weber.htm#E After the war, he was interned by the Allies and a short time later he was extradited from Luxembourg. According to documents from the Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, he was sentenced to ten years hard labour on July 21, 1950, in Luxembourg. Following a pardon on April 23, 1951, his sentence was reduced to seven years imprisonment. Ackermann returned to Germany in the early 1950s when his prior years of internment were counted against the reduced sentence and he was released.

She served as Regent or \\"Queen-Lieutenant\\" of Aragon during the absence of her spouse from 1324 until 1327.Theresa Earenfight: The King's Other Body: Maria of Castile and the Crown of Aragon, 2010 She was a daughter of Pere II Ramon de Montcada and Elisenda de Pinos.CATALAN NOBILITY, Medieval Lands She and James II founded the Monastery of Pedralbes, a Franciscan convent of the Poor Clares. After James II's death in 1327, Elisenda lived adjacent to the monastery for the remaining 37 years of her life. Early life Coat of Arms Elisenda de Montcada was believed to have been born in Aitona, the daughter of Pere II Ramon Montcada i d‚ÄôAbarca, Baron of Aitona, and Elisenda de Pinos. She belonged to the lineage of Montcada, one of the most noble families of Catalonia, close with the monarchy. Elisenda had three brothers: Ot, heir to Aitona and a godfather of the future Peter IV of Aragon; Gast√≥, bishop of Huesca and later of Girona; and Guillem Ram√≥n.http://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0043623.xml Montcada. (in Catalan) Accessed 29-02-2016. Elisenda's great-grandmother was Constance, Lady of Aitona, an illegitimate daughter of Peter II of Aragon, making her and her husband second cousins once removed. Queen and regent After James II was a widower by his third wife, Maria of Cyprus, he hurried to contract a new marriage. Just a month after the death of the unhappy queen, he went to obtain a dispensation of consanguinity in the third or fourth grade to arrange new nuptials. The king did not indicate the name of the chosen, but it was Elisenda of Montcada. The monarch seemed very animated with the idea and openly hastened the proceedings that were taken. Her marriage to James II took place in Tarragona on 25 December 1322. The king endowed the bride with income from Berga, Burriana, Tortosa, Morella, Torroella de Montgri, and Pals, and her brother Ot with the locations of Ser√≤s and Mequinensa. She was 30 and he, who was widowed in 1319/1322, was about 55. She thus became stepmother to James' ten children by his second marriage to Blanche of Anjou; they had no children of their own. She favored the grandson of James II, the future Peter the Ceremonious. They settled in the royal palace in Barcelona and led a relatively quiet life. She intervened in the affairs of state, giving advice as the other queens had done. The queen was described as mature, educated, beautiful, and very pious, and the day to day at the royal court as cordial, despite the rigidity and severity of James himself. From 1324, she acted as regent during his absence from Aragon. The marriage lasted for five years before James died in November 1327. Jesus Ernest Martinez Ferrando wrote: \\"Elisenda, for her feminine qualities, for her exquisite religiosity, was the best sedative that the monarch could find in the bitterness of his last years; dialogue with the devoted wife sweetened their hours of spiritual and physical ordeal; it can be said that Elisenda helped James II to die well. As death approached - as observed in the mentioned biography ‚Äì it was established between the two spouses 'a mutual religious delight'\\". The new queen chose Barcelona and its Palau Reial Major as her usual residence, even though Tortosa was in the midst of her dowry and its castle was the residence of her predecessors, the queens Blanca of Anjou and Maria of Cyprus, for extended periods. Because they had no children and the king soon became ill, Elisenda devoted her life to her religious practices and the exercise of charity. Construction of the Monastery of Pedralbes Elisenda eventually became interested in the foundation of a monastery of the Order of the Poor Clares around Barcelona. Once she expressed this desire, the king hurried to please her, even though there was already Vilafranca del Pened√®s, a monastery of Poor Clares founded by Blanca of Anjou, his second wife. He only placed one condition ‚Äì that the monastery was to be erected in honor of the mother of God. At first it was designated to be located at the site of Valldaura, between Cerdanyola and Montcada, but then it was decided on a place called Pedralbes due to the amount of white stone extracted from an existing quarry. In 1326 work began on the monastery in Pedralbes; the management and construction advanced rapidly. Perhaps James II sensed his death and wanted the mystical enthusiasm of his wife to become a reality as soon as possible. After a year the basic structure of the monastery was done: they could use the cloister, and the church and housing for the nuns were almost finished as well. On 3 May 1327 fourteen nuns entered the monastery and they elected the first abbess, Sobirana d‚ÄôOlzet. In a will which he wrote just a few months before his death, the king ratified, among other things, donations on income made to his wife. In addition he left her the gold crown that he had purchased at the time of the wedding and many other jewels, fine fabrics and tablecloths and dishes crafted with gold and silver. Elisenda was widowed in November 1327. She ordered a small palace to be built next to, but completely separate from, the monastery. She lived there for the remaining 37 years of her life. Although she was never a nun, Elisenda was endowed with broad powers over the internal workings of the monastery. She participated actively in the decision making of the religious community and put special emphasis on obtaining several privileges for the monastery. For example, it was under the direct protection of the city of Barcelona through the Consell de Cent, the managing body of the city, which was committed to defend the monastery in the event of danger. It was also her intention was to have Pedralbes be the most favored monastery so it would not face economic difficulty after she died, quite common in the female monasteries. During these years royal donations nearly drowned the Franciscan spirit of the convent life. Elisenda managed the construction of the buildings and their ornamentation. Painters, like Ferrer Bassa and the Serra brothers, were contracted to beautify the monastery. Elisenda also promoted the paintings in the chapel of St. Michael, which were ordered by the abbess Francesca Saportella, her niece. Although she stayed at the monastery, she did participate in some official regnal events, such as the transfer of the remains of Saint Eulalia to the Cathedral in Barcelona, when she accompanied Maria of Navarre, wife of Peter IV of Aragon, and Constance of Aragon, wife of James III of Mallorca. Death and burial Elisenda's will was issued on 11 April 1364 and she died on 19 July of that year. She bequeathed everything to the monastery as her primary heir, except for some goods destined for institutions, relatives, or acquaintances. She requested that they raze the palace where she lived, which was done immediately. The inventory that was made of her room demonstrates the simplicity in which she lived, despite the jewels and fine fabrics that she gifted. The tomb of the Queen is a magnificent work of Catalan Gothic that artistically represents the double life of this woman. The bifrontal tomb is located along a wall that separates the church from the cloister, with unique presentations on each side. From the church, Elisenda is portrayed as a queen wearing her crown, and from the cloister she is dressed as an austere widow or nun. Legacy The Monastery of Pedralbes is Elisenda's most significant legacy. It is a national monument, and is open to the public. Elisenda's portrait is part of the Gallery of Illustrious Catalans at the Barcelona City Council. Passeig de Reina Elisenda de Montcada is a street named after her in the Sarri√† neighborhood of Barcelona, as is the associated Reina Elisenda station of line L6 of the Barcelona Metro. The station is 0.7 km northeast of the monastery.

The march was organised to seek amendments in the Sindh Tenancy Act that was also legislated after thousands of peasants gathering in front of Sindh Assembly building Karachi in 1950 led by late Comrade Hyder Bux Jatoi, a stalwart peasants leader of Pakistan.Daily Times, PakistanDaily Dawn Pakistan Organisers and leadership The long march was organised and led by the prominent peasant's rights and civil society activist Zulfiqar Shah, who then was Coordinator of South Asia Partnership Pakistan, a nationwide civil society organisation and Sindh Agrarian Reforms Action Committee, a coalition of peasant bodies and organisations.Daily Dawn, Pakistan Marchers cross the villages and towns The march was begun from the mausoleum of Comrade Hyder Bux Jatoi at the historical tomb of 18th century popular King of Sindh, Ghulam Shah Kalhoro where beyond 15000 peasants gathered and started marching through the various streets of Hyderabad city continuously for 7 hours. After marching past Hyderabad city, hundreds of the marchers passed through various prominent cities, towns and villages of Sindh including Tando Mohammad Khan.

Daily Times Pakistan Peasants rights and issues in Pakistan Agriculture is the most important sector of Pakistan's economy. Agricultural growth has been the key element associated with economic development of Pakistan, despite the fact that the share of agriculture in GDP has fallen from 53% in 1947 to 21% in 2006‚Äì07. The share of Sindh province in Pakistan's agriculture value added accounts roughly for 25 percent. Sindh is typically rich in rangeland resources (about 55% of its land surface). The share of agriculture in Sindh GDP, which was 30% in 1999‚Äì2000, is estimated to have drastically declined to about 20% during the last five years due to a variety of physical, sociological and institutional framework factors. One of the main institutional constraints in Sindh is the highly skewed land ownership pattern and defunct tenancy system.Zulfiqar Shah, Question of Land Reforms in Pakistan, Encounter Page, Daily Dawn, Karachi In Sindh, more than one third of the land is tenanted and about two-thirds of land is under sharecropping, a form of farming where output is shared between the landowner and tenant. Sharecropping is the predominant form of tenancy in Sindh where the land ownership distribution is particularly skewed. After independence in 1947, there have been four formal institutional reforms in land ownership and tenancy system prevailing in Sindh ‚Äì Sindh Tenancy Act (STA) 1950, Land Reforms 1959; Land Reforms 1972 and Agrarian Reforms 1977.Encounter page, Daily Dawn Karachi Peasant rights in the context of landlord ‚Äì peasant relationship had been protected through formulation of the Sindh Tenancy Act [STA] in 1950 after the rigorous struggle of the peasants of Sindh. With the passage of time the socio ‚Äì economic trends and conditions have been changed and the productive relations and agriculture patterns have transformed due to urbanisation, use of technology and globalisation. The existing STA has become irrelevant and does not fulfill the right and needs of the peasants and address the contemporary socio-economic situation in rural society of Sindh. In this regard, after a consultative process by civil society organisations with the peasants of different crop pattern area, peasant activists and legal experts a draft of amendments in STA have been developed. Since last a couple of years the peasants of Sindh with the support of their representative organisations and civil society actors have been struggling for the amendments in the STA. Long march demands The long march was carried to amend the following sections of Sindh Tenancy Act 1950: Section 2 (2), Section 4 (1), Section 4 (II -a), Section 4 (II-b), Section 5 (2-a), Section 5 (3-a), Section 9, Section 10 (1), Section 12 (1), Section 12 (2), Section 13 (e), Section 13 (f), Section 13 (g), Section 13 (i), Section 14 (1), Section 14 (5), Section 22 (I), Section 25, Section 28 (1-b), Section 32, Section 34 (1), Section 34 (2), Section 25 (1-d) The major demands were to establish peasants' courts, re-defining peasantry, eviction of peasants from the land, share in the crops and agriculture inputs and a wide range of issues relating peasantry in Sindh.Asian Human Rights Commission, Hongkong Commitments by Sindh government As soon as long March reached Sindh Assembly builds, Deputy Speaker Sindh Assembly, Ms. Shehla Reza along with couple of minister and a large number of MPs including Ms. Farheen Mughul, and Mr. Anwar Mahar.

On the occasion, Deputy Speaker Sindh Assembly Ms. Shehla Reza spoke to the marchers and made a public commitment for the amendments by the coalition government of Pakistan People's Party in Sindh.

Originally written in Folsom State Prison in 1965, and published three years later in 1968, it is Cleaver's best known writing and remains a seminal work in African-American literature. The treatises were first printed in the nationally-circulated monthly Ramparts and became widely read for their illustration and commentary on Black America. Throughout his narrative, Cleaver describes not only his transformation from a marijuana dealer and serial rapist into a convinced Malcolm X adherent and Marxist revolutionary, but also his analogous relationship to the politics of America.  Background  Eldridge Cleaver was born in Wabbaseka, Arkansas, in 1935, amidst the severe and unrepentant racism of the South. In 1946, his family moved to Watts, California, where, although the racial climate was not as acute, the young Cleaver began delving into petty crime. After a series of arrests throughout his adolescence, in 1954, he was sent to Soledad State Prison for possession of marijuana. Though he was released within two years, later in 1957, he was convicted of sexual assault with intent to murder and was subsequently sent to San Quentin and then onto Folsom. While imprisoned at Soledad, Cleaver obtained his high school diploma and read the opuses of Thomas Paine, Richard Wright, Lenin, Machiavelli, Karl Marx, Voltaire, Malcolm X, and W. E. B. Du Bois. When he arrived at Folsom, he began to regularly write freely upon the subject of his \\"social\\" and physical imprisonment and the events of the era; eight years later his lawyer, Beverly Axelrod, took the compositions to Ramparts and they were immediately published. After his release in December 1966, Cleaver was reporting for the magazine in San Francisco, and in 1968 Soul on Ice was released. The essays in Soul on Ice are divided in four thematic sections:Andrews, William L., Frances Smith. Foster, and Trudier Harris. The Oxford Companion to African American Literature. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. * \\"Letters from Prison\\", describing Cleaver's experiences with and thoughts on crime and prisons * \\"Blood of the Beast\\", discussing race relations and promoting black liberation ideology * \\"Prelude to Love - Three Letters\\", Two love letters written to Cleaver's attorney, Beverly Axelrod and one written to Cleaver by Axelrod. * \\"White Woman, Black Man\\", on gender relations, black masculinity, and sexuality The central premise surrounding the book as a whole is the trouble of \\"identification as a black soul which has been 'colonized'... by an oppressive white society that projects its brief, narrow vision of life as eternal truth.\\" Cleaver uses the informal essays to navigate through the history and present state of America, covering topics such as the murders of Malcolm X and Emmett Till; the race riots and Vietnam War; U.S. Foreign Policy and the American Flag; Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King, Jr. and other \\"black celebrities;\\" Richard Wright's Native Son; Islam and Christianity; day-to-day prison life; and the relationship between black men and white women. In the book, Cleaver admitted to raping black girls as a \\"practice run\\" before seeking white women as prey, but claims that in jail he had come to consider those acts as inhuman and, inspired by Malcolm X, had repudiated racism. The text also included homophobic criticism of the writings of the black novelist James Baldwin.\\"The black homosexual, when his twist has a racial nexus, is an extreme embodiment of this contradiction. The white man has deprived him of his masculinity, castrated him in the center of his burning skull, and when he submits to this change and takes the white man for his lover as well as Big Daddy, he focuses on ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù all the love in his pent up soul and turns the razor edge of hatred against ‚Äúblackness‚Äù‚Äîupon himself, what he is, and all those who look like him, remind him of himself.\\" Soul on Ice p. 103.

It has impacted many important decisions by the government and influenced policy making in important environmental matters in India. The beneficiaries of the Foundation are the citizens of India at large. Awaaz Foundation was founded on 21 February 2006 by Sumaira Abdulali, a well-known environmentalist, who has exposed many scandals of environmental villainy in India at personal risk. The Foundation has filed several public interest litigations, including demands for strict implementation of noise pollution laws, better functioning of Mumbai‚Äôs Tree Authority, reducing noise pollution, banning sale of tobacco to minors, efforts to counter the politically sponsored sand mining mafia and recognition of the biodiverse Sawantwadi- Dodamarg wildlife corridor as an ecologically sensitive area. Noise pollution Indian festivals, increasingly commercialised and politicised, are becoming louder and show record peak levels in spite of increased public awareness and better implementation of time limits following Court Orders. Use of firecrackers is increasing and they are now used round the year for every kind of celebration including weddings, cricket matches, Hindu, Muslim and Christian festivals and other miscellaneous events. These firecrackers are being lighted on public roads with traffic passing over them momentarily. Mumbai is the noisiest city in the world and traffic is a continuous source of noise. An auto rickshaw in Mumbai measures 82.6 dB during this recording by Awaaz Foundation Noise pollution is a serious health hazard and can cause annoyance and aggression, hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, heart disease, mental illness and other serious effects on health. Like smoking, noise pollution affects active and passive recipients when noise levels cross certain safe boundaries. Anti-Social behaviour such as public use of firecrackers and Loudspeakers is a highly sensitive social issue in India. Among the major forms of pollution in India is noise pollution. There is no parallel in the world to the noise pollution generated during festivals and religious celebrations in India. For Indians, making noise is a sign of happiness. For politicians the ability to make a big noise, by using huge loudspeakers at any opportunity, is a sign of strength. Festivals in India have become political battlegrounds as politicians try to score brownie points over one another by attempting to host the noisiest festival. The use of loudspeakers, permitted by the courts on certain occasions, often exceeds the permissible decibel limit, causing a great deal of stress and anxiety to the neighbourhoods. Awaaz Foundation has advocated against noise pollution from various sources and has conducted campaigns to create awareness of adverse health effects from noise in a methodical and scientific manner. The various noise pollution campaigns of the Foundation have received widespread public support and turned into a public movement in Mumbai followed by the rest of the country. Increased awareness and vigilance of citizens has resulted in policy change, better systems and better implementation of Noise Rules. Awaaz Foundation has measured noise levels from myriad sources including festivals, traffic, construction and religious places. This is a measurement during Ganpati 2013, the loudest festival in Mumbai. Awaaz Foundation systematically collected noise pollution data for the first time in India, collated and presented it to the State and Union Governments, Courts, police and citizens. Data was generated of noise levels at major events since 2003, from sources including firecrackers, traffic, loudspeakers, industrial equipment and construction. In 2010 Awaaz Foundation tested noise levels of helicopters after several leading Industrialists applied for permission to build private helipads atop their residential buildings in densely populated areas of Mumbai. After the data was presented in court. permission to use private helipads in all urban areas of India were banned by the MoEF. Also based on data presented to MoEF during the pendency of the public interest litigation in the Bombay High Court, Government of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests accepted all recommendations by Awaaz Foundation on 11 January 2010 for stricter noise laws in the country and issued a new notification to ban use of loudspeakers, musical instruments and honking in the areas demarcated as silence zones, including areas around religious places throughout India. The MoEF denied permission to the State Government of Maharashtra to permit private helipads for personal use of individuals atop residential buildings and included other sources of noise such as traffic and construction noise within the ambit of the Rules for the first time. Awaaz foundation filed a Public Interest Litigation on 12 November 2007 in Mumbai High Court seeking implementation of Noise Pollution Rules, 2000, which contemplate creation of silence zones around educational places, courts, hospitals and religious places also. In 2009 the Bombay High Court accepted the need for implementation of stricter noise laws and ordered the State Government to implement Noise Pollution regulation rules notified by 'Central Pollution board', (one of the Subordinate and statutory bodies) of Government of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests. Consequent to the Bombay High Court Order, the State Government of Maharashtra initially notified and asked municipal bodies in the state to demarcate an area of around educational institutions, hospitals and courts as silence zones but left out the areas surrounding religious places as silence zones. Awaaz Foundation once again petitioned the Court to have these places notified as silence zones. On 6 August 2009, the principal secretary of the Home Department, Government of Maharashtra in an affidavit told the court that about 1,313 religious places had been identified in the city of Mumbai and the BMC would put up Silence zone boards within three months. Sumaira Abdulali recording noise under a Silence Zone board at a religious place Finally on 20 Aug 2009 principal secretary (appeals and security) Government of Maharashtra Mr. Anna Dani filed an affidavit stating that a supplementary notification has been issued to include all religious places in silence zone, and has been circulated to all civic bodies in the state. Awaaz Foundation‚Äôs advocacy against noise pollution in India motivated the Government of India to make rules and implement them. Awaaz Foundation has successfully petitioned both local and state governments in India to impose stricter noise pollution laws. Under the Environment Protection Act, in which the new Noise Pollution Rules are framed, violation of the rules is punishable with a Jail term of up to five years and fine of . Firecrackers, initially used mainly during the Diwali Festival, are now used to celebrate almost any occasion including weddings, cricket matches, and festivals of every community. Awaaz Foundation tested the noise levels of firecrackers along with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board in 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2013. The noise level of almost all crackers exceeded 100 dB and some varieties consistently exceeded 125 dB. Firecracker packaging did not disclose details of noise levels or chemical content or even the year of manufacture; the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) who is the Authority to check firecrackers at the stage of manufacture and the Arms and Explosives Department of the Mumbai Police who license firecracker vendors did not take action for many years following complaints of violations. In 2012, Awaaz Foundation, under Right to Information, obtained an Order to disclose details of all firecrackers tested by PESO on their website. Diwali 2012 was the quietest Diwali in recent years In 2013. the Mumbai Police undertook an awareness and enforcement campaign for the 10pm deadline on bursting crackers during the Diwali Festival. The Firecracker Distributors' Association of Mumbai and Thane also cooperated in this effort. Diwali 2013 was the quietest in a decade. Awaaz Foundation also has organised volunteers groups, offered them support and education to all those who faced noise related problems, independently monitored Ambient noise level using sound level meter. and interacted with the authorities to ensure their support and co operation. Excessive noise from loudspeakers, construction, traffic and firecrackers have been separately taken up by Foundation at various times and with various authorities; educational programs and publications for schools, colleges, citizens groups and the authorities empowered to implement the laws have been supported and implemented. Awaaz Foundation encouraged citizen participation to implement noise rules by creating awareness about a free downloadable application onto phones to measure decibel levels. Awaaz requested citizens to complain to the Mumbai Police website with a copy to them for followup and received numerous complaints in the festival season 2012. In 2013, Awaaz Foundation used newly available technology called Noise Watch, a free App to use smartphones or iPhones as decibel meters to build a participatory citizens campaign to map noise levels across Mumbai. A Facebook page Citizens' Noise Map supports the initiative and the readings taken by citizens are upload able directly onto a GIS map. The initiative caught on quickly during Ganpati 2013 and spread to other Indian cities such as Pune almost immediately. The citizens' noise map was sent to the Chief Minister of Maharashtra and spurred a decision of the Government to conduct a formal noise map of Mumbai. Awaaz Foundation has conducted numerous awareness campaigns including #GetWellSoonMumbai, a social media campaign on Facebook, #TellTheDriver not to honk in partnership with the Thane, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai Traffic Police, #HornFllu in partnership with the Indian Medical Association, Noise Annoys in partnership with the Times of India #YourAwaazAgainstNoise, #GodsAgainstNoise. In 2015, community leaders carried out awareness drives to reduce noise from Mahim Fair and Eid e Milan through public Statements and grass root level campaigns Awaaz Foundation measured noise at the Shiv Sena Party's annual Dasara Rally in 2010, 2011, 2012 2013, 2014 and 2015 and presented their findings to the Police and Bombay High Court. Based on these readings the Police filed cases against Rally organizers. Following final hearings of Awaaz Foundation's PIL, clubbed with nine other PILs by the Bombay High Court in August 2016, a comprehensive final Order was passed. For the first time, noise levels during the Ganpati festival declined in 2016 Noise levels declined again during Diwali 2016. Mumbai, which in January 2016 was named the noisiest city in India by the Central Pollution Control Board was the only city to see decline in noise levels during the Diwali Festival. The Mumbai Police issued a Statement thanking citizens of Mumbai for making noise pollution reduction a citizens' movement.  Sand Mining  Awaaz Foundation and BNHS created awareness against coastal sand mining for the first time in a national or international forum at the UN Convention on Biodiversity, Conference of Parties 11 in Hyderabad India in October 2012 Suction pumps can extract a large volume of sand in a short period of time and can also operate through the day and night and through all seasons to quickly denude an area of its sand. Manual sand mining, although labour-intensive, can extract huge quantities of sand due to the sheer number of such miners at a given stretch. In Thane creek, hundreds of manual sand mining boats operate simultaneously. This 13-year-old boy has been mining sand manually for the past 3 years in an illegal sand mining operation near Mumbai. Illegal sand mining is extensive around cities like Mumbai where it is required for construction. There is often a link between politicians and illegal sand mining in India. Awaaz Foundation has also worked to conserve the coastal ecosystems and aquatic ecosystem habitats, and has engaged in marine conservation activism against nonessential seabed mining. Sand mining is a practice that is becoming an environmental issue in many countries. Awaaz Foundation has raised public awareness of illegal sand mining in Maharashtra and Goa States of India. Illegal sand mining is a major unacknowledged threat to coastal and riverine biodiversity in India. The suspension of Indian Administrative Service officer Durga Shakti Nagpal for allegedly acting against illegal sand mining in Noida UP has brought the issue, which is rampant all across the country, into sharp focus. Sand mining is a little known threat to biodiversity, water security and prime coastal or riverside land all over the world and is capable of causing land erosion, contaminating sweet water along coastlines and rivers, and destroying entire habitats in a very short space of time. While there are numerous scientific studies on habitat degradation for various other reasons, and specific studies on loss of various species of flora and fauna, there is no official information available on the effect on entire ecosystems due to large scale illegal sand mining, particularly coastal sand mining. The issue was brought to attention at any national or international forum for the first time through a side event The effect of coastal sand mining on biodiversity at the Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of Parties 11 by Awaaz Foundation and Bombay Natural History Society(BNHS) in October 2012. In August 2013, the National Green Tribunal banned sand mining in rivers across India. However, illegal sand mining on the coast around Mumbai continued even after the Order. The term sand mafia has been referred to by the Indian media while referring to those supporting or engaged in illegal sand mining (mainly politicians) who threaten, attack and kill Government and Police officers, activists or any other person who attempts to stop the illegal activity. MITRA (Movement against Intimidation, Threat and Revenge against Activists), a network of NGOs to protect activists in Maharashtra was set up after an attack by the sand mafia on Awaaz Foundation Convenor Sumaira Abdulali in 2004. This was the first publicly reported attack by the sand mafia but over the years there have been numerous others including a second attack on Sumaira Abdulali and a team of journalists, the murder of a Police Officer in Madhya Pradesh, murder of activists in Tamil Nadu and UP, and the suspension of IAS Durga Shakti Nagpal. Awaaz Foundation wrote to the Prime Minister of India protesting Durga Nagpal's transfer and demanded an investigation into the links between the transfer, the murder of activist Pale Ram Chauhan in the same area a few days later, and the politically led sand mafia of the region. An investigation was conducted by the MoEF and the presence of the sand mafia was confirmed. Report of MoEF on sand mining The State Government of Maharashtra first took serious note of illegal coastal sand mining in 2004 following an incident of assault at Kihim Beach on Sumaira Abdulali (Convenor of Awaaz Foundation) by the son and employees of a local Member of the Legislative Assembly who are part of an extensive politically controlled sand mafia in Maharashtra. After that, Awaaz Foundation filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Bombay High Court seeking a ban on mining activities along the Konkan coast. Following the PIL, the court banned mining in the CRZ (coastal regulation zone) area and directed that a comprehensive report on alternatives to sand dredging prepared by Indian Institute of Technology Bombay should be implemented by the State Government. The Report includes measures to compulsorily manufacture and use artificial sand from building debris, environmental cess on natural sand and more environmentally friendly techniques of sand dredging. Sumaira Abdulali was attacked a second time in March 2010 at Mahad while inspecting a site where illegal sand dredging is rampant. Thereafter, the Bombay High Court has completely banned all sand mining activity in the State of Maharashtra and the Government has been forced to notify a completely new Policy on sand mining after considering the IIT Bombay Report. Sumaira Abdulali of Awaaz foundation raised some specific queries under the Right to Information Act regarding number of licences issued to barges carrying sand from Raigad district to Mumbai and Navi Mumbai along with the name of barges owners, conditions for operations as well as the number of inspections deployed to check if any contraband material was being smuggled into the jetty. The MMB did not respond for several months, then foundation filed these queries with the Maharashtra State Information Commission. Thereafter, the concerned agencies responded that neither The Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) nor Directorate-General of Shipping (DGS) nor The Indian Coast Guard maintain any records of the number of barges that move in and out of the inland waters on a day -to -day basis. The new sand mining policy stipulates that the barges should be registered and the list should be updated with the local Tehsildar. The Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) will Provide No Objection Certificates to the sand barges that pass through the sea channel after the letters of approval from the district collector. Awaaz Foundation inspected numerous illegal sand mining sites in the coastal areas near Mumbai including Thane, Vaitarna, Bankot Creeks, Kihim and Awas beaches and sent their findings to the MoEF, Government of Maharashtra, police and local authorities. They were instrumental in bringing public awareness about illegal sand mining and political links to this activity. Awaaz Foundation published a Report ' The links between politicians and sand mining in and around Mumbai. To control illegal sand mining controlled by politicians, Awaaz Foundation has proposed a specially trained environmental police in India. To advocate policy change and raise awareness internationally, Awaaz Foundation participated and raised awareness for the first time in any national or International Convention through a side event in the Conference of Parties 11 held under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Hyderabad India in October 2012. Awaaz Foundation participated in the making of a documentary film on international coastal sand mining, Sand Wars, directed by Denis Delestrac. Sand Wars had record viewership when shown on the French channel Arte. Awaaz Foundation is advocating inclusion of coastal sand mining on the Agenda of the next Convention of Biodiversity Conference of Parties 12 in 2014 by writing to the Indian Government, who is its International custodian until October 2014. In 2016, Awaaz Foundation once again represented to the United Nations that the ill effects of sand mining should form part of the global agenda of the United Nations Environment Programme during a meeting with Mr Erik Solheim, chief of UNEP. They also pressed for mainstreaming of alternative methods of building and road construction using recycled debris and plastics, which have been successful in pilot and small projects. In August 2016 a number of people lost their lives when a bridge was swept away at Mahad. The bridge was located near a sand mining site where Sumaira Abdulali had been attacked in 2010 during a sand mining site inspection. Sand mining equipment was found abandoned in the creek. Awaaz Foundation demanded an enquiry into the link between the collapse and nearby illegal sand mining, but Home Minister to the Government of Maharashtra Deepak Kesarkar, without carrying out any enquiry, stated that there was no link. Mining in dense forests Sawantwadi-Dodamarg is one of the most thickly forested area in Maharashtra (49%) and is extremely biodiverse including tiger, elephant and a variety of indigenous flora and fauna. In 2006, India applied to the UNESCO MAB for the Western Ghats to be listed as a protected World Heritage Site. The Western Ghats is very important Tropical Rainforest of India. During the monsoon season between June and September, the unbroken Western Ghats chain acts as a barrier to the moisture laden clouds. The range starts near the border of Gujarat and Maharashtra, south of the River Tapti, and runs approximately through the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala ending at Kanyakumari, at the southern tip of India, one of three Biodiversity hotspots in the country. The National Mineral Policy of India, 2008 rules that any abandoned mine \\"should be made richer than what it was before\\" through refilling the craters and reforestation, but most miners leave their mines in a state of utter decay and toxicity. According to the data available with the ministry's Indian Bureau of Mines, there are 297 abandoned mines across the country and most of them are yet to be \\"rehabilitated\\". To protect large-scale destruction of flora and fauna around Western Ghats. Awaaz Foundation is advocating a zero- mining policy. After 49 mining licenses were sanctioned by the Government of Maharashtra, 22 villages of the Sawantwadi-Dodamarg wildlife corridor made official representations to have their area notified as eco sensitive. Tiger is often spotted here and this is the Tiger God they worship. Awaaz Foundation successfully filed public interest litigation to declare the Sawantwadi- Dodamarg wildlife corridor as an eco sensitive area. The State Government of Maharashtra had sanctioned 49 mines in the area, even though its own record shows that the corridor, connecting national parks such as Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra with those in Goa and Karnataka, abounds in indigenous flora and fauna including tiger and elephant and has the highest green cover in Maharashtra (49%). Sawantwadi-Dodamarg, due to its many natural springs and high rainfall, is also a source area for rivers which feed water to Goa. 22 villages signed resolutions not to allow mines in their area.http://southasia.oneworld.net/news/mining-sanction-to-steer-india- towards-ecological-ruin#.UkYivhY0Pdk The ministry of environment and forests of Government of India appointed two high levels Committees to recommend the type of development which should take place in the Western Ghats. Initially, the MoEF appointed the Western Ghat Ecology Expert Panel headed by ecologist Dr. Madhav Gadgil but suppressed its Report which recommended that the entire Western Ghats were eco sensitive to varying degrees. Awaaz Foundation and other concerned citizens filed Right to Information applications which resulted in the Report being made public over 6 months after it was finalised. Amid growing demand for implementation of the Western Ghat Ecology Expert Panel, the Government appointed another Committee chaired by Dr. Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan to assess the recommendations of the Western Ghat Ecology Expert Panel Report. Dr. Kasturirangan Report too, was neither accepted nor declined for several months. Meanwhile, Awaaz Foundation's litigation for declaration of the Sawantwadi-Dodamarg wildlife corridor as eco sensitive was heard by the Bombay High Court on 28 September 2013 and the Government ordered to notify it as eco sensitive before 31 December 2013. The Order was passed during the pendancy of both high level Committee Reports and forms a precedent for citizens/villagers to take up smaller bio diverse areas for protection. Heavy Metal Pollution Awaaz Foundation measured heavy metal content of firecrackers and Holi colours and found high levels of toxic heavy metals in both. Tests conducted by Volunteer Faiz Abdulali using a sensitive meter capable of detecting specific heavy metals instantly through surface contact was used. In 2013, metals which are banned under the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules 1989 and placed under Schedule 1 for their highly toxic nature through ingestion or through contact were detected such as Vanadium, Copper, Zirconium, Lead and other heavy metals. These were found specially in commonly used crackers such as sparklers which are often handled by children. Awaaz Foundation has demanded a full disclosure of all chemical content of firecrackers on their packaging. This would be in accordance with Supreme Court Orders.

The route runs through suburbs immediately west of Minneapolis, Minnesota, from MN&S; Junction in Crystal south to Auto Club Junction in Bloomington near the Minnesota River. This path is parallel to Minnesota State Highway 100, which is about half a mile east of the rail line. History Today's MN&S; Spur was originally built starting in 1908 as part of the Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester and Dubuque Electric Traction Company, more commonly known as the Dan Patch Line. That railroad fell into bankruptcy in less than a decade, but the successor Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway was more successful and operated independently until being acquired by the Soo Line Railroad in 1982. It carried passenger trains and interurbans until 1942. The Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern is the source of the \\"MN&S;\\" name. The old Dan Patch mainline extended south to Northfield, and CP/Soo still own the tracks from Savage to Lakeville. Today, Progressive Rail, Inc. owns the track between Lakeville and Northfield, operating it as their Jesse James Line. The Twin Cities and Western Railroad currently owns the Dan Patch Line Bridge over the Minnesota River. TC&W; has trackage rights over the MN&S; Spur and purchased the bridge in order to protect what they feel may become a valuable shipping route in the future. Early in 2016, TC&W; rehabilitated the Dan Patch Bridge. Connections with other lines The MN&S; Spur has junctions with four rail lines among three railroad companies: The Canadian Pacific's Paynesville Subdivision in Crystal, the Union Pacific Railroad's Golden Valley Industrial Lead in Golden Valley, CP's Bass Lake Spur in St. Louis Park, and Progressive Rail's Dan Patch Line in Bloomington. The line also crosses over BNSF Railway's Wayzata Subdivision in St. Louis Park, and there used to be a junction between the two lines. There's also a connection with Union Pacific's Mankato Subdivision in Savage, but this is on the inactive segment of track. Edina } Twin Cities and Western is the primary operator on the Bass Lake Spur. While it is possible to interchange between the two lines, it is a cumbersome process because of the track layout (as of 2010). A replacement junction has been planned since 1999 or earlier that would allow TC&W; trains to make continuous moves onto the MN&S; Spur, but those plans stalled for about ten years. TC&W; used to operate through the 29th Street rail trench, now known as the Midtown Greenway, but the rail line was severed at Hiawatha Avenue in the 1990s. The Bass Lake Spur was temporarily routed along the Kenilworth Trail to connect with BNSF Railway's Wayzata Subdivision in Minneapolis. That connection was only expected to last between one and six years, but has now been in place for more than a decade. As of 2010, Hennepin County and the Metropolitan Council plan to build the Southwest Corridor light rail line along the Kenilworth Trail alignment currently used by the Bass Lake Spur, so the MN&S; interchange project is being reexamined. A new study is planned to be complete by the end of the year. Progressive Rail's current Dan Patch Line was also a branch of the MN&S.; It led to the southern end of Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis where MN&S; interurban passengers could board streetcars operated by the Twin City Rapid Transit Company and continue into downtown.

It was declared redundant on 1 June 1994, and was vested in the Trust on 17 May 1995. The church stands in parkland near the site of Draycot House, a manor house demolished c. 1955. The name of the church has been changed over the centuries. It was All Saints' in the later 12th century and St. Peter's in the 18th century; it has been St James since the later 19th century. The church has an Early English chancel which is lower than the floor of the 13th-century nave. The two-stage west tower dates from the 16th or 17th century and is supported by diagonal buttresses. The church was altered and restored in the 19th century. There were wall paintings in the chancel in the 15th and 16th centuries. The interior includes a Gothic pulpit and box pews. There are also Victorian stained glass windows and monuments including a Perpendicular tomb chest, a 13th-century knight's effigy said to be of Phillip de Cerne, and a bust by Joseph Wilton to Sir Robert Long. The gothic painted tomb of Sir Thomas Long is within the church, along with tombs and memorials to members of the Long family. Some of the oldest tombs are to the de Cerne family from the 12th and 13th centuries. Sir Edward de Cerne is commemorated with a monumental brass on his tombstone.

The rifle is designated with an \\"LE\\" code; \\"Law Enforcement\\". All 110 BA series rifles are configured with AccuTrigger, matte-blued barreled action, fluted heavy free-floating barrel, muzzle brake, oversized bolt handle, external box magazine (holding 5 - 6 rounds), magpul adjustable stock, adjustable pistol grip, and three swivel studs for sling and bipod mounting. The Savage 110 BA is similar to the Savage Model 10 rifles (10 BAS-K and 10 BAT/S-K). Whereas the Model 10 rifles are short actions rifles the 110 BA uses a long action. Stock and grip Close up of the 110 BA Magpul stock Close up of the 110 BA Pistol Grip The 110 BA also comes stock with a Heckler & Koch PSG1 style pistol grip. The grip is a target-type grip which contains an adjustable palm shelf. A hex bolt rather than a rotating dial tightens or loosens the palm shelf. Loosening the bolt allows for the palm rest to move up and down to accommodate the shooters hand size. Tightening the bolt locks the rest into a set position that is now customized to the shooters hand size. Sights The Savage 110 BA rifle is provided with pre-drilled holes for attachment of a Picatinny rail system; which the rifle comes with. The picatinny rail allows for a variety of add-ons. The rail is long enough to mount a scope towards the receiver end and can accommodate such devices as night vision in \\"front\\" of the scope. The rail system also has two side mounts for additional devices such as flashlights or laser sighting. The lack of iron sights is because Savage expects users of this rifle to utilize telescopic sights as opposed to iron sights. Telescopic sights are not only more precise, but a \\"must\\" for the extreme long distances that this rifle is capable of achieving. A scope is not included because the choice of a particular scope can be a very personal selection that involves a shooters particular taste, comfort, and opinion which are all subjective. Factors that some shooters use to determine a particular scope are: weight, magnification, size, clarity, and many other features. Trigger The 110 BA comes with the Savage Arms developed \\"AccuTrigger\\". This trigger is intended to give a shooter the flexibility to set trigger pull to individual preference without having to pay a gunsmith to adjust it. The trigger can be adjusted from 6.5 to 26 N (1.5 to 6 lbf). Savage claims that even when adjusted to its lowest setting, the AccuTrigger is completely safe and cannot accidentally discharge during normal use from being jarred or dropped when maintained and adjusted as intended. The AccuTrigger offers a relatively short lock time of 1.6 milliseconds favoring accurate shooting.Locktime By Randy Wakeman Adjustment Savage claims adjustment of the AccuTrigger is a simple process. Removal of the stock is necessary where rotation of an adjustment spring is required. This is accomplished utilizing the Savage supplied tool. The AccuTrigger has a single adjustment location and is designed so it cannot be adjusted below the minimum setting. This adjustment feature is yet another example of the built-in customization design of this rifle. Customization allows users to adjust the rifle to their own personal comforts and preferences which can equate to accuracy improvement.AccuTrigger reviewAccuTrigger Specifications Heavy barrel The 110 BA includes a fluted heavy barrel that is free-floating which provides high accuracy. Thicker barrels are generally stiffer, and thus deflect less when a force is applied, such as when a forearm touches a barrel. A heavier barrel also tends to vibrate less when fired, thus sending bullets more consistently in the same direction. Their greater weight (within reason) makes it easier to hold the rifle steady. For all of these reasons, heavy barrels are generally more accurate than lighter barrels. The \\"flutes\\" are essentially grooves that are cut into the length of the barrel to help it dissipating heat. There are many arguments for and against fluted barrels; but whatever the take Savage decided that fluting this barrel on the 110 BA was a good idea. Free-floating A free-floating barrel means that the barrel does not touch the stock that is connected to it except at the very end near the receiver and bolt end; where it is attached. The advantage to this design is that there is less vibration resonance. This means that as bullets are fired down the barrel their energy is usually channeled down the edges of the barrel. If the barrel were touching the stock throughout its entire length the energy traveling down the barrel would be transferred to the stock. This transference of energy to the stock would thus cause resonance which results in prolongation of vibrations by reflection. The effect of this is that the entire rifle tends to vibrate which causes inaccuracy as accuracy is a product of stability and not movement. A barrel that is free-floating thus eliminates these problems. Muzzle brake The 110 BA comes with a 3.5\\" inch muzzle brake that is threaded to an industry standard 5/8x24 (5/8-24 UNEF-3A) thread pitch. Savage felt that a muzzle brake was essential in the rifle design as the .338 Lapua Magnum round generates recoil that most shooters find unpleasant. The muzzle brake has no bottom gills, forcing the expanding gases to channel up and out. This feature eliminates any \\"dust cloud\\" when firing from a prone position which would normally give away a shooter's position in a tactical situation. By channeling the expanding gases upward and backward muzzle rise and recoil is reduced by what Savage claims is 35 percent. Project designer Steve Danneker claims the 110 BA has felt recoil comparable to that of the .308 Winchester round. Rate of twist According to project designer Steve Danneker of Savage Arms, the rate of twist for the .338 Lapua Magnum was chosen to be 1 in 9\\". Most rifles in this calibre use a 1 in 10\\" twist. A 1 in 9\\" twist allows a bullet to rotate along its center axis at a faster rate than a 1 in 10\\". Faster rotation helps stabilize longer bullets at their maximum range. This allows new bullet designs such as the all-copper and Very-low-drag bullet (VLD)-style projectile to remain stable through the very long travel distance. Most bullets are not designed for the extreme ranges provided the .338 design; thus a 1 in 10\\" twist is adequate. The rifling rate of twist is: * 1 in 9\\" for all 110 BA .338 models * 1 in 10\\" for all 110 BA .300 models Magazine Savage utilized the Accuracy International detachable five-round, single stack box magazine for the 110 BA. This magazine box is utilized in their Accuracy International Arctic Warfare sniper rifle but not the same magazine used in the Accuracy International AWM (Arctic Warfare Magnum) model. Utilizing an already existing box magazine facilitates the availability of extra magazines for shooters of 110 BA. An important note on the 110 BA magazine is that it adheres to the .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges loaded to the C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes √† Feu Portatives) maximum allowed overall length of 93.50 mm (3.681 in). It actually accepts up to a 95.50 mm (3.760 in) overall length round, though most factory ammunition doesn‚Äôt exceed 3.600 inches. This is an important distinction because some rifles chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum such as the Accuracy International AWM does not adhere to CIP standard and thus does not function properly due to a lack of internal magazine length.The New AX rifle shown at the Shot Show 2010, Las Vegas The reason for this problem is that the AWSM bolt-action is not specifically designed for the fat and long .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge. Because of this, ammunition manufacturers produce .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges that are loaded short enough (‚âà 91.44 mm / 3.600 in) to fit in the AWSM magazines. As long as .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges that will fit in the magazines are used, the AWSM rifles can be used as repeating rifles instead of single shot rifles.

Overview and history  The Quill was first published in 1910, and is the second oldest student newspaper in western Canada (The Gateway at The University of Alberta is older by two months). It was also the first student run publication at Brandon College, created as a response to the growth in the college at the time. The Quill was originally published three times a year, and then quarterly, with a hope of establishing itself and then becoming a weekly paper. In 1927, the Brandon College Publishing Board split the paper into two separate publications - The Quill, a biweekly newspaper, and The Sickle, a yearbook. In 1933, The Quill moved to a broadsheet format, but this was abandoned in the 1934-1935 year. Weekly publication was introduced in 1963 (although it had been weekly as early as 1937). It has sporadically changed from weekly to biweekly and to different formats and printers many times since then. The Quill has been financed primarily through funding from BUSU, and at present, advertising and a student levy. In 1997, The Quill became one of the first student newspapers in Canada to produce the paper in a completely digital format. The Quill has been located at a number of locations on campus. Its first home was at the base of the Bell Tower in the original Clark Hall. In the 1970s it was produced in a mobile trailer near the gymnasium, before moving to the former Students' Union office in the lower level of the McMaster Building in 1980. Finally in 1991, the Quill was moved to its current location on the second floor of the Knowles-Douglas Student Centre. The Quill continues to be a member of the Canadian University Press. As a democratic collective, The Quill is open to all students and staff at Brandon University. An autonomous corporate entity since 2005, The Quill is a student run publication; the articles, editing, layout and distribution are done by the students.http://bartok.brandonu.ca/link/3484/The-Quill/ Notable editors * Dr. Stanley Knowles, New Democratic Party Member of Parliament * Trent Frayne, Sports Journalist * Brian Ransom, Member of Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba, 1977-1986 * Dan Bjarnson, CBC Reporter and author See also *List of student newspapers in Canada *List of newspapers in Canada ReferencesExternal links * Category:Student newspapers published in Manitoba Category:Brandon University Category:Canadian University Press Category:Publications established in 1910 Category:1910 establishments in Manitoba ","title":"The Quill (newspaper)"},{"id":"29216395","title":"Oxygen (Hadouken! song)"},{"id":"29216413","text":"Claire Linton Cribbs (August 13, 1912 ‚Äì September 14, 1985) was an American basketball player and high school coach.

Introduction  The Samyang 85mm supports most SLR mounts and thus its dimensions vary accordingly. As a manual focus only lens, it does not support auto focus. This has enabled the manufacturer to produce a lens of exceptional quality while remaining significantly cheaper than equivalent lenses from either Nikon or Canon. The lens contains one aspherical element. It is also sold under a number of different brands such as Walimex, Rokinon, Vivitar and Bower. Samyang has released the AE version of the lens for Nikon which includes a CPU and electronic contacts to allow for automatic exposure in all modes, including in camera models that do not normally support automatic exposure with manual focus Nikon Ai lenses. The first version of the lens (in all mounts) had a golden ring. A second version with a red ring has been released, and benefits from the new UMC coating. A third version was later released, which changed the shape of the lens hood mount.  Reception  Photozone noted low distortion and vignetting, high longitudinal chromatic aberration and competitive sharpness at f/4. At other apertures, it \\"may not be the sharpest lens around but it offers a good and very affordable introduction into shallow depth-of-field photography\\". Camera Labs evaluated the lens as delivering \\"very good results\\" when \\"viewed in isolation\\", and giving a sharper image in the corners than a Nikkor 85mm f1.4G, but losing to it in the centre.

Included within are the exclusively Cambrian Plectronocerida, Protactinocerida, and Yanhecentida, and the Cambro-Ordovician Ellesmerocerida. The Plectronocerida is the earliest group of the four and gave rise to the other three. Of these four orders, only the Ellesmerocerida crossed (barely) into the Ordovician, with two genera, Ectenolites and Clarkoceras. The Ellesmerocerida in turn gave rise to the superorders Endoceratoidea, Actinoceratoidea, Discosoratoidea, Orthoceratoidea, and Nautilitoidea. The Ellesmerocerida, Endoceratoidea, Actinoceratoidea, and Discosoratoidea are restricted to the Paleozoic. The Orthoceratoidea, which extend at least into the Triassic, gave rise to the Ammonoidea which became extinct by the end of the Cretaceous. Nautilitoidea exist living today as the Nautilidae, represented by Nautilus and Allonautilus. Plectronoceratoids are generally small to tiny forms with orthoconic or endogastric shells, a few being exogastric, with proportionally large ventral siphuncles that contain numerous diaphragms. Orders are determined principally by differences in siphuncle detail. References * *Flower, R.H. 1964, The Nautiloid Order Ellesmeroceratida (Cephalopoda).

Probably built around the turn of the 19th century but also including an older ell, it is one of the rural community's finest examples of Federal period architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Jared Cone House is located a short way south of Bolton center, on the west side of Hebron Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with two interior chimneys and an attached single-story kitchen ell. The central bay of the main facade is dominated by a substantial Palladian window on the second level, whose elements are framed by pilasters. The window is above the main entry, which is flanked by pilasters and topped by a semi-circular transom window. The interior follows a fairly typical Georgian central hall plan, and retains original moulding and fireplace surrounds for seven fireplaces, as well as a massive fireplace in the kitchen ell. The oldest portion of this house is the kitchen ell, which has a construction date of about 1770. The main block of the house is almost certainly a later construction, based on the large amount of Federal style woodwork, as well as the Palladian window, which appears to be integral to its construction and not a later alteration. Jared Cone (1733‚Äì1807) served as a Lieutenant, and later a Captain at the Lexington Alarm. Local lore is that Cone bankrupted himself building the house, and sold it in 1804 to Saul Alvord. The house was home to Bolton's post office for a time, with Alvord as the first postmaster, followed by his son Henry. The house's property originally included what is now the adjacent Herrick Park, donated to the town by owners in the 1960s.

Biography Born to a Jewish family in Kentucky, Marcus moved to Hillsboro, Texas after dropping out of high school to work and live near his brother Theodore, his three sisters and his parents. His various retail, sales and janitorial positions helped him escape the economic hardships of life in Kentucky. He moved to Dallas, Texas in 1899 and married Minnie Lichtenstein, the mother of his four sons, in 1902. They moved to Atlanta with his sister Carrie and her husband Abraham Lincoln Neiman to work for The Coca-Cola Company. Their success was rewarded with a buyout of $25,000 in exchange for giving up the sales territories in Kansas and or Missouri of the nascent soft drink concern. This $25,000 enabled the Neiman and Marcus families to establish Neiman Marcus in Dallas in 1907.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7317765 Neiman-Marcus specialized in ready made high quality clothes for women at a time when visiting a tailor and or doing extensive alterations at home was the norm. Business grew quickly as cotton and later oil and other industries and population growth buoyed the Texas economy. In 1928 his sister Carrie divorced A. L. Neiman, Herbert bought out Neiman's share, and Neiman-Marcus came entirely under Marcus family control. Herbert became president of Temple Emanu-El (Dallas, Texas), was a director of the Dallas Museum of Art and held many other civic positions to bolster the culture and well being of the city that made Neiman-Marcus thrive. The Marcus family negotiated with Cond√© Nast of Cond√© Nast Publications and Neiman-Marcus became the first concern located West of the Atlantic Seaboard to advertise luxury fashion in their magazines. During World War II Herbert and the Marcus family and employees helped Neiman-Marcus showcase clothing and lifestyles that would be most helpful with regards to rationing and other wartime realities. The post war years brought more lavish fashion shows and finery into Neiman-Marcus as luxury goods returned to fashionability. Carrie Marcus Neiman and Herbert's sons took increasing responsibility for both fashion and business decisions as Herbert aged. After Herbert's death in 1950 his sister Carrie and then his son Stanley Marcus took over top management positions.

Its property, which includes five contributing buildings, was listed as Glen Dale on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Farmed since the 1770s, the farm achieved prominence in the second half of the 19th century as one of the nation's top breeding sites of merino sheep. Features Significant features of the English barn include hand-hewn, post- and-beam, hardwood timber frame, with flared columns and half dovetail tenons on the girts. Sheathing boards visible from the inside appear to be original as they are up to 2 feet wide and fastened with hand-wrought nails. In the 18th century, this structure would have been a general-purpose barn, sheltering grain and hay crops as well as farm animals. The construction materials and remarkable joinery in the English barn speak eloquently of this period in local history. Glen Dale Farm attained its present appearance under the ownership of Milo B. Williamson, a breeder of Merino sheep and \\"gentleman's driving horses\\". The present Italianate style farmhouse and additional barns are pictured in Burgett's 1876 Illustrated and Topographical Atlas of the State of Vermont. The barn complex is remarkably intact when compared to the Burgett illustration and constitutes one of the best surviving examples of nineteenth century stock and sheep farms in the state. The English barn is the second from the left as pictured in the Burgett lithograph. The two larger barns in front were built to house horses and carriages. The ventilated cupolas and the raking eaves trim are typical of barns built in Vermont during the 1870s and 1880s. The rearmost structure is the sheep barn, one of the few remaining unaltered such buildings in the state. Ownership Glen Dale owner Milo B. Williamson was a prominent figure in the Vermont Merino Sheep Breeders' Association. He was treasurer of the association in 1879-1881, and president in 1882-1883. In partnership with Jerome P. Cherbino of Middlebury, he owned and bred Spanish stock Merino sheep during the period when Addison County dominated the world market. History According to Mathews‚Äô History of the Town of Cornwall, Solomon Linsley settled the land that Glen Dale Farm occupies in 1774. The Town of Cornwall received its original charter from the Governor of New Hampshire dated November 3, 1761. The names of sixty-five original grantees are endorsed on the back of the charter, which is still preserved among the archives of the town. The first non-aboriginal settlers within the original bounds of the Town of Cornwall arrived in 1774. There were fourteen of them but Linsley was the only one whose name is on the original charter. It is recorded that Gamaliel Painter of Middlebury surveyed for Solomon Linsley on October 23, 1774. Although the original farmhouse does not stand, Linsley probably built the existing English barn around 1775, as it is representative of the first major type of agricultural buildings constructed in Vermont. Glen Dale Farm is a local landmark in the Town of Cornwall and surrounding environs. The 1871 Beers Atlas of Addison County shows the prominent location of the M.B. Williamson property on Cider Mill Road. John Axtell in the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, Historic Sites and Structures Survey commented that Glen Dale Farm \\"... on its ridgetop site is and ought to be preserved as an accurate and invaluable document of post-Civil War agricultural life in Vermont.\\" Considerable effort has been made to stabilize the barn structures with assistance from the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation. The Division for Historic Preservation's book The Historic Architecture of Addison County lists the Glen Dale barns as being on the Vermont State Register of Historic Places. The farm is mentioned specifically in the introduction to the section on Cornwall, describing it as one of several model stock farms operating in Cornwall during the second half of the 19th century. It was one subject of a 1991 study of historic agricultural resources in the state. In July 2002, Glen Dale Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Built in 1914, the facility was renamed in 1985 in honor of former Speaker of the House Carl Albert, a native of the town. A bill to name the Federal Building in McAlester, Oklahoma, the \\"Carl Albert Federal Building\\" (September 21, 1984). It previously served the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Significance The building shortly after construction was completed. The city of McAlester was founded in 1870. It was named for an early settler of the area, James McAlester, who set up a tent store where the heavily traveled Texas Road crossed the California Trail. Later when the railroad was established, the area began to flourish. As the area grew, so did the need for a postal facility. Built in 1914, the building served as the main Post Office for the area until the late 1960s when the Postal Service relocated.General Services Administration page on the Carl Albert Federal Building. The building was named the \\"Carl Albert Federal Building and Courthouse\\" in honor of the 46th Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives at a formal ceremony on November 27, 1985. In 2013, the federal government ceased all court activities, and in 2016, the building was given to the city of McAlester. Architectural description The building is an example of Neo-Classical Revival architecture. The three-story brick-clad structure rests on a brick base. The first level features rows of recessed bricks which lend a rusticated look to the building at this level. A molded limestone belt course atop the rustication separates the first floor from the second. There is also an unenriched limestone beltcourse above the third floor windows. A denticulated entablature supports a bracketed cornice. A brick parapet surmounts the building. The first floor exhibits arched windows with bracketed keystones, elements of the Italian Renaissance style. The upper brick-clad floors exhibit the Greek orders in the use of columns and a pedimented cornice at the main elevation. This combination of elements is characteristic of the Neo-Classical style, a popular style in the early 20th-century Federal buildings. The south elevation is the main elevation. At the center of this elevation lies a three- story recessed bay with loggias on the first and second floor levels. Five brick archways with bracketed keystones open onto the loggias at the entry. Within each archway are arched, paneled Doric pilasters. The loggia has a concrete floor and a vaulted, stucco ceiling. At the second floor level, the loggia is defined by four free-standing Corinthian columns. The columns support a pedimented entablature, and rest on the stone belt course above the first floor level. The second floor loggia also has a concrete floor with cement finish and a paneled stucco ceiling. Five French doors open onto the loggia from the second floor courtroom. The French doors are set within a molded limestone surround, ornamented by a twisted rope motif all around. The door surround also encompasses the eight pane operable transom and the two pane fixed transom over each double door. Above each door opening is a green- veined marble roundel with a molded denticulated outer ring ornamented by a series of glyphs. All windows are replacements. They are aluminum windows with horizontal lights, the lower light being operable. First floor windows sit within arched wood frames and rest on bracketed stone sills with paneled spandrel beneath. Second floor windows are ornamented by a flat limestone lintel with keystone. Third floor windows are ornamented by limestone keystones. The main entry to the building is on the south elevation. Original wood panel entry doors have been replaced with aluminum storefront doors. The secondary entry is to the west. Granite steps and cheek walls lead to both entries. Original cast iron light standards sit on the south elevation cheek walls. Original cast iron wall-mounted lanterns flank the west elevation entry. The north elevation of the building originally provided the loading dock area for the Postal Service. As originally built a wooden loading dock projected from the center of the one-level east and west wings. The original wood loading dock has been enclosed and clad with bricks. A limestone parapet with unenriched entablature rests atop the bricked-in loading dock. East and west wings of the first floor enclosure appear rusticated by the use of recessed brick courses. In 1989, a three-story fire escape was built at the northeast corner of the building. The escape consists of two buff brick towers with a steel fire stair running between. Access to the stair is through fire doors at the northeast corner of the second and third floor corridors. Significant interior spaces include the second floor courtroom; and second and third floor corridors. The courtroom retains cork tile floors at the entry and in the jury box. The original chair rail remains in the courtroom, though the ornamented ceiling was covered with acoustical tiles. The corridors appear largely original except that vinyl tile now covers the original terrazzo floors. The original wood base remains, as do a significant number of original doors.

These portraits of John Knox and George Buchanan had been sent to Geneva in November 1579 for inclusion as woodcuts in Theodore Beza's Icones (1580), but arrived too late for the book. The woodcuts of Knox and James VI published in Simon Goulart's 1581 edition of the Icones are thought to follow Vanson's portraits. Another woodcut image of George Buchanan, not used in the Icones, but appearing in other works, has been attributed to Arnold Bronckorst.Cameron, J.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties as the Saengerfest Halle. History=Saengerfest Halle Davenport's strong music tradition is due in large part to the influx of German immigrants into the city starting in the late 1840s. They founded numerous music groups in the city before 1900. The groups with longer staying power included: the Liedertafel (founded in 1848), Maennerchor (1851), Strasser's German Union Brass Band (1856), Germania Band (1883), and three other groups founded in the 1850s included Gesang Chor Der Turngemeinde, Deutscher Saengerbund, and Onretti Verein. There were also short-lived music organizations: Germania Saengerchor, Gesang Verein Teutonia, Eintracht Glee Club, Claus Groth Singing Society, Thalia Verein, Harrigaria Maennerchor, and the Davenport Saengerbund. In 1858 the city hosted the third annual Saengerfest, or singer's festival, which drew people from throughout the Mississippi River Valley. The largest music event in Davenport's history took place in 1898 when it hosted the 18th annual Saengerfest. It brought together ten local German singing groups as the United Singers of Davenport. Together they organized and hosted the event. The festival included 1,200 singers from Davenport, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Elgin, Illinois, Elkader, Iowa, La Crosse, Wisconsin, Manning, Iowa, Moline, Illinois, Peoria, Illinois, Rock Island, Illinois and St. Louis, Missouri. The event drew German-Americans from throughout the Midwest, and Western Union added extra German operators so as to get news of the festival out over the wires. An estimated 100,000 people attended the four-day event. The festival ended with an outdoor concert at Schuetzen Park that was attended by 12,000 people. Preparations for the festival included building a 4,000-seat auditorium for the event. A holding company built the wood structure for $4,500. After the festival ended the hall was used as a warehouse. In 1906 a second floor was added by new owners and the building was dedicated as a dance hall called The Coliseum. It was destroyed by fire on October 21, 1913. The Coliseum In November 1914, the new Coliseum was opened by owner Leo Kerker. The new building is located across West Fourth Street from where the original Saengerfesthalle was located. It was designed by local architects Clausen & Burrows and constructed by local contractor Oelrich & Company. with The building has a steel frame covered with brick. It has an arched roof, and individual tiles across the top of the fa√ßade each have a letter that spells out the word ‚ÄúColiseum‚Äù. The structure also features two-story corner pavilions and brick pilasters on the side elevations. A sign with the name ‚ÄúThe Col Ballroom‚Äù hangs over the main entrance. The words are in the shape of a heart. In the early 1990s, the building was extensively renovated both inside and out. Ownership of The Col was passed to Don Wachel. The Quad Cities Mexican American Organization took over ownership in 1995. The building has operated as a ballroom and concert venue ever since. Lee Neece took over the ownership in 2014 and Leigh Macias Reitz in 2015. A back wall of the building has the autographs of performers who played there. Artist who performed at The Col include: Duke Ellington, B.B. King, the Everly Brothers, The Beach Boys, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Johnny Cash, Muddy Waters, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. The Col Ballroom was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1998, and it was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Music Association hall of fame in 1999.

His early life  Thomas Risley was born on 27 August 1630, the second son of Thomas Risley and Thomasin Lathon Risley and christened at Newchurch, Kenyon, Cheshire on 2 September 1630. He was educated at Boteler Grammar School, Warrington under Mr Nathan Ashworth and, in 1649, went to Pembroke College, Oxford where his elder brother John had graduated before becoming a fellow of New College, Oxford. Calamy describes his life at the university: \\"he passed his time as a recluse... he aimed at acquiring useful knowledge and learning rather than fame.\\"  Oxford University Fellowship  After the restoration of Charles II of England in May 1660, Royal visitors were sent to the University to enquire into matters. Thomas Risley evidently satisfied the enquiry and was confirmed in his fellowship and the following instrument drawn up in his favour ‚Äì \\"We, having received sufficient testimony of the honest life and conversation of Thomas Risley MA, as also of his diligence in his studies, his progress and sufficiency in learning of England, the government of this University, and the statutes of College wherein he lives, do by these presents, ratify, allow and confirm the said Mr T Risley in his fellowship with all rights, dues and prerequisites thereunto belonging, notwithstanding any nullities, irregularities or imperfections which in strict interpretation of the said statutes may be objected.\\" Dated 20 June 1661. Thomas Risley held his fellowship until 24 August 1662 when he was obliged to surrender because he would not comply with the Act of Uniformity 1662. The college however, because of their respect for him, and because they were unwilling to lose so valuable a member, allowed him a year to consider his position. During this time, \\"he examined the terms of conformity with great diligence and impartiality, that he might be able to satisfy others as well as his own conscience and he was not carried away by the prejudices of education\\". On 10 November 1662 he was ordained deacon and priest by the Bishop of Norwich, Dr Edward Reynolds, who in his certificate gave him a very honourable character. One of the provisions of the Act of Uniformity 1662 was that no-one could be a Minister in the Church of England unless he had been ordained by a Bishop so, at this stage, he was clearly uncertain about his rejection of the act, although Reynolds, having himself been a Presbyterian, was clearly sympathetic to Risley's views. Thomas Risley's episcopalian ordination raises the important point of his assent to the Book of Common Prayer. The Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion contained in it were not changed at all when the Prayer Book was revised in 1661. Article Thirty-six assumes episcopal ordination as the normal mode, whether it is in the form contained in the prayer book of Edward VIor the form as in the book as revised in 1661. So far as can be seen, Risley could have had any theological objection to the Prayer Book, as he did in fact accept if from Reynolds. That he approved and valued the thirty-nine articles is certain because a stipulation was inserted in the deed of conveyance of the ground on which the Risley Chapel stood, namely \\"that the Minister of the Chapel shall subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles\\".  Life after Oxford  Edmund Calamy wrote of Risley that, despite his long period of deliberation, \\"he could not, for any place, be satisfied to come up to the conditions prescribed by the Act. He retired, therefore, to his estate in the country, where, during the storm of persecution, he employed himself in preaching privately to such as scrupled conformity, and in visiting the sick, for whose sake he applied himself to the study of physic; by the practice of which he more effectually engaged their attention when he administered to their spiritual advice.\\" About four years after he left Oxford for Lancashire, the Vice-Chancellor of the University wrote to him, pressing him to return and offering preferment to encourage his conformity, but his conscience would not let him. The Royal Declaration of Indulgence of 1672 had allowed Protestant Dissenters the right of public worship, but when it was later withdrawn and the Conventicle Act again imposed, a number of Croft and Risley Nonconformists were brought before the Bishop, and amongst them was Thomas Risley. \\"Thomas Risley, of Woolston- cum-Poulton, Gent. Fined ¬£5. This gentleman is one that saith they will not desist\\". With the passing of the Toleration Act in 1689, his neighbours, who had previously been his clandestine congregation, resolved themselves into a regular society and \\"committed themselves to his pastoral conduct, and he was very useful among them by his ministerial performances and exemplary life and conversation.\\" The Toleration Act also decreed the licensing of meeting houses, an arrangement which was accepted without complaint as it placed the building and congregation under the protection of the State. Property given for religious uses was secured by trust deed, and the \\"dissenting interest,\\" as it was then called, had legal recognition. Ministers, duly licensed and sworn, were made exempt from many services to which laymen were subject. A list of licensed \\"chappells\\" in South West Lancashire has survived and amongst them is Richard Jackson's barn in Culcheth, for which Thomas Risley held the licence. Local tradition has it that, prior to the licence, \\"conventicles\\" were held in a field near to the site of the later Chapel. It appears that at the time of the founding of the Risley Presbyterian Church there was a very strong Presbyterian influence in the Warrington area. References in the Quarter Sessions records state for example, that the house of Francis Turner was registered on 23 January 1706/7 as a Presbyterian place of worship, as was that of John Bent on 24 April 1710, both at Warrington. At some point in his life Thomas Risley married a woman by the name of Catherine. With a growing congregation, and active participation in ecclesiastical life in Lancashire and northern Cheshire, the more settled state of the country after the turn of the century led Thomas Risley and his congregation to the decision to erect a permanent chapel. Thomas Risley died in 1716. at the age of 86, and was buried in Risley Chapel graveyard. His tombstone still exists, but the original inscription became obliterated by weathering. A later minister. the Reverend William Dunn, who took a great interest in preserving relics of the early history of the chapel, placed upon the tombstone the following inscription: > Here interred the body of the Rev Thomas Risley MA Oxford. He left the > Church of England in 1662, and built Risley Chapel in 1707, where he > officiated up to his death. He died in 1716, aged 86 years. \\"The righteous > shall be in everlasting remembrance\\" Psalm cxii, 6. Thomas Risley's funeral sermon was preached by his friend Dr Charles Owen of Warrington, from the text 2 Kings 2:12. This was afterwards printed, together with brief \\"Memoirs of his life.\\" Thomas Risley did not contribute much to literature; the only work known to exist is \\"The Cursed Family; a treatise on the evil of neglecting family prayer.\\" The celebrated John Howe wrote a preface to it. in which he gave some account of the author. Thomas Risley left at least two sons, Thomas and John. John Risley was born 19 January 1690, educated at Glasgow, and succeeded his father in the Ministry at Risley Chapel.

Skjalm Hvide (before 1045 ‚Äì c. 1113), was the Earl of Zealand in Denmark in the end of the Viking Age (793‚Äì1066) and up to his death. Skjalm's father was Toke Trylle, whose father was Slag (or Slau, or he may have been called by both names), based on Absalon, a medieval account scanned, translated and published by Google.Absalon, at Historic Books Project by Google. Skjalm Hvide was very rich. He was one of the most influential and powerful chiefs in Denmark in the Middle Ages, and the most powerful chief of his era, i.e. the late Viking Age, late 11th century and early 12th century. He is regarded as the founder of the Hvide Clan, the name Hvide signifying the color white. During the transition ending the Viking Age and a few centuries ahead, the Hvide clan was a dominant factor in the Danish power politics.Roskildehistorie.dk: Skjalm \\"p√•tog sig at opdrage konges√∏nnen Knud (Lavard).\\" (Skjalm brought up Canute, the king's son.) In 1062, on August 9, Skjalm Hvide together with the King Sweyn II of Denmark (c. 1019 ‚Äì 28 April 1076; reigned in 1047‚Äì1076)Svend 2. Estridsen  Gyldendal ‚Äì Den Store Danske (\\"The Great Dane\\"). fought in the Battle of Nis√•, a naval battle off the coast of Halland, in what today is southwestern Sweden. The enemy were the forces of the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada, who had claimed the Danish throne since 1047, and had launched raids into Denmark ever since then. With his invasion of Danish territory in 1062, Harald wanted to decisively defeat the Danes, and thus finally be able to conquer Denmark.Bricka, Carl Frederik, Dansk Biografisk Lexikon, vol. XVII [Svend Tveskj√¶g ‚Äì T√∏xen], 1903, p. 3‚Äì5.http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/hardrade2.html, p. 61.http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/hardrade2.html, p. 63.http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/hardrade2.html, p. 65.http://www.jomsborg.eu/Saxobog11.pdf. Skjalm Hvide was captured by Harald's forces, but he later managed to escape. Harald relinquished his claims to Denmark in 1064, in exchange for Sweyn's recognition of Harald as the King Harald III of Norway.Louise K√¶mpe Henriksen, Historiske Personer ‚Äì Svend Estridsen ‚Äì konge af Danmark (\\"King of Denmark\\"), 1047‚Äì74., vikingeskibsmuseet.dk Harald then sailed off to England, to claim the crown of England, but ‚Äì instead ‚Äì was killed there. In c. 1085, Skjalm Hvide founded and erected the J√∏rlunde Church (J√∏rlunde Kirke), located on the island of Zealand, in J√∏rlunde, North Zealand. It is one of the earliest and oldest still existing churches in Denmark. The church is richly decorated inside with frescos dating back to the mid-12th century, created by the so-called J√∏rlunde workshop. The original appearance of the church was first changed by a conversion in c. 1350. Like his father Toke Trylle who was baptized in Christian tradition,Gavebogen (\\"Gift Book\\"): Liber donatorium monasterii sorensis, translation by Svend Ranvig in: Sor√∏kr√∏niken (\\"Sor√∏ Chronicle\\"), Volume 2; Absalon og hans sl√¶gtninges genealogi (\\"Absalon and His Family Genealogy\\"), Copenhagen, 1986, p. 49. Skjalm Hvide was one of the earliest Nordic leaders known to have accepted Christianity as their faith. Thereafter, the Hvide clansmen regularly rose to the highest positions in the Christian clergy, including several as Roman Catholic Archbishops of Lund.Skjalm Hvide In c. 1100, after his brother had been murdered, Skjalm Hvide with his warriors sailed for a revenge to R√ºgen, the largest island by area in what today is Germany. R√ºgen at the time had been used by Wendish pirates as their base. It was perhaps in connection to this expedition of his when Skjalm Hvide made the people of R√ºgen taxpayers for the Danish crown, of which Saxo Grammaticus has written. After this event, Skjalm Hvide was appointed the bailiff of R√ºgen by the King Eric I of Denmark. According to Saxo, Skjalm Hvide established peace between the Danes and Wends, and he at one point also ruled the Wends. Based on Saxo's account, Skjalm Hvide was also the bailiff of Zealand, and commanded the King of Denmark's armed forces. In c. 1102, Skjalm Hvide undertook the task of providing home and care to King of Denmark's eldest and only legitimate son, Canute Lavard, starting from when Canute's parents, the King Eric I of Denmark (Eric I, Eric the Good; Danish: Erik Ejegod, a son of King Sweyn II) and Queen Boedil Thurgotsdatter (both Eric I and Boedil were descendants of King Sweyn I of Denmark) embarked for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, during which both Eric I and Boedil became ill and died in 1103. Skjalm Hvide hereafter took the responsibility of bringing up Canute Lavard, a mission in which Skjalm's brother Aude provided assistance. Canute's son Valdemar, who became the King Valdemar I of Denmark (\\"Valdemar the Great\\"), ‚Äì in turn ‚Äì was brought up by Skjalm Hvide's son Asser Rig. Danish island of Zealand (Sj√¶lland). Around it are the Danish Straits, which connect the Baltic Sea ‚Äì on the right ‚Äì and the Atlantic Ocean. On the top right is Sweden (Sverige). On the bottom is Germany. On the bottom right is the island of R√ºgen, where Skjalm Hvide attacked in c.1100, after the murder of his brother.  Skjalm Hvide's stronghold in Zealand  During Skjalm Hvide's lifetime and for a long time thereafter, the Hvide Clan was most active and influential on the Danish island of Zealand (Danish: Sj√¶lland), and some of the surrounding areas, including e.g. other Danish islands and Sk√•ne, also known as Scania, in what today is the southernmost province of Sweden. The Hvide Clan had an important stronghold in and around J√∏rlunde, North Zealand,Ark√¶ologiske udgravninger i Danmark (kulturarv.dk 1993). where in. c. 1085 Skjalm Hvide erected the J√∏rlunde Church (J√∏rlunde Kirke). Today, J√∏rlunde is a village in the Frederikssund municipality, about 26 km northwest of central Copenhagen, in the Capital Region of Denmark, with a population of 305 as of 1 January 2019.\\"BEF44: Population 1st January, by urban areas\\", 2019 database from Statistics Denmark. The earliest known written mention of the place-name J√∏rlunde is in a document from 1085.Bent J√∏rgensen: Danske stednavne (\\"Danish place-names\\"), 3rd ed., Gyldendal, 2008. In addition to North Zealand, Sk√•ne (Scania) and some other areas, Skjalm Hvide also held large land possessions in and around what nearly five decades after his death, in 1161, was founded as the town of Sor√∏ by Skjalm's grandson Absalon, a son of Asser Rig, in the south-central part of Zealand. In Sor√∏, Skjalm Hvide's sons Ebbe Skjalmsen Hvide and Asser Rig (Hvide) in 1140 founded and in 1142 consecrated the Sor√∏ Abbey. It was the preeminent and wealthiest monastic house in all of Denmark during the Middle Ages, which acquired property all over Denmark, with an income larger than that of the royal family. Near Sor√∏, Ebbe also erected the Bjernede Church, and Asser established a Benedictine House, just a few years before his death in 1151. Asser lived as a monk for the last years of his life.Dansk Biografiske Lexicon. Vilhelm Bissen's equestrian statue of Absalon on H√∏jbro Plads in Copenhagen, facing the Christiansborg Palace, where Absalon's Castle once stood. In 1161‚Äì1201, Asser's son Absalon erected at the Sor√∏ Abbey grounds Sor√∏ Klosterkirke, i.e. the Sor√∏ Abbey Church, a burial site for four Danish rulers. Around the time he started that work, he also founded what today is the city of Copenhagen.Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pages 14‚Äì15. Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's erection of the Absalon's Castle on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167, at the site of the later Copenhagen Castle and where the Christiansborg Palace ‚Äì the home of the Danish Parliament (Danish: Folketing) ‚Äì stands today. The construction of the Absalon's Castle was done in response to the attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the Danish coastline during the 12th century. Defensive ramparts and moats were also built for the castle, and at the latest by 1177 also the St. Clemens Church had been completed on the same site. The earliest written mention of Copenhagen, located on the island of Zealand, was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum referred to it as Portus Mercatorum, meaning Merchants' Harbor or ‚Äì in the Danish of the time ‚Äì K√∏bmannahavn. In 1186, a letter from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon by King Valdemar I. Archaeological excavations done in 2018 point to there possibly having been also another church in Copenhagen at the time of the erection of the Absalon's Castle in the 1160s, and ‚Äì accordingly ‚Äì Copenhagen possibly having been a bigger town in Absalon's lifetime than previously has been thought.Archaeologists think they have found Copenhagen‚Äôs oldest church Science Nordic, April 28, 2018. Additionally, around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on a higher ground of Copenhagen, to the northeast of the town. The town began to further develop around that church. At 7,031 km2, Zealand is the largest and most populous island not only in today's Denmark proper (thus excluding Greenland and Disko Island, which are larger), but also in the entire Baltic Sea region. Zealand's official population on 1 January 2018 was 2,302,074.Population, 1 January 2018 per Island, Statistics Denmark. Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is located partly on the eastern shore of Zealand and partly on the island of Amager. Other cities in Zealand include Roskilde, Hiller√∏d, N√¶stved and Helsing√∏r. Especially in the Viking Age (793‚Äì1066), but also before it and after, Zealand has often played a critical role in history. This is due to its strategically important location in the center of the narrow waterways known as the Danish Straits, which connect ‚Äì and provide the only maritime gateway between ‚Äì the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. To be in control of this gateway in the Middle Ages was both a guarantee and sign of enormous power.  Adam of Bremen on Skjalm Hvide's turf  Adam of Bremen (before 1050 ‚Äì 12 October 1081/1085) was a German monk and chronicler, most famous for his chronicle Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum (Medieval Latin for \\"Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church\\"), a historical treatise written in 1073‚Äì1076, to which Adam made additions (scholia) until his death. It is one of the most important sources of the medieval history of Northern Europe, and the oldest textual source reporting the discovery of coastal North America. It covers the entire period known as the Viking Age, from the foundation of the bishopric under Saint Willehad (a.k.a. Willihad (); c. 745 ‚Äì 8 November 789; a Christian missionary and the Bishop of Bremen from 787) in 788 until the rule of the Prince-Bishop Adalbert (c. 1000 ‚Äì 16 March 1072), who served as the Archbishop of Hamburg and Bishop of Bremen in 1043‚Äì1072.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , p. 7. In 1066 or 1067 Adam was invited by Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg (a.k.a. Adalbert of Bremen; also Adelbert, Albert; c. 1000 ‚Äì 16 March 1072) to join the Archdiocese of Bremen. He was accepted among the capitulars of Bremen, and by 1069 appeared as the director of the cathedral's school. Soon thereafter he began to write the history of Bremen, Hamburg and the northern lands in his aforementioned study, nicknamed as Gesta. Adam's position and the missionary activity of the church of Bremen allowed him to gather information on the history and geography of Northern Germany and some of the surrounding areas. On this mission, Adam at some point in 1073‚Äì1076 spent time at the royal court of King Sweyn II of Denmark (c. 1019 ‚Äì 28 April 1076; reigned in 1047‚Äì1076), a.k.a. Sweyn II Estridsson.His first name is also spelled as Swen, Svein and Sven and his last name as Estridson, Estridsson or Estrids√∏n. presumably including in Slangerup ‚Äì a part of which is J√∏rlunde ‚Äì, based on the fact that King Sweyn II primarily used as his home the royal estate there and its equivalent in Dalby, near Lund. The German archbishops of Cologne and Hamburg were at the time competing on which one of the two would succeed on converting the pagan Nordic peoples north of Germany into Christianity, and on which one of the two would get to expand his archdiocese north from Germany. In this contest, and on his time spent in Denmark, Adam of Bremen represented the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. Adam reported of having received a lot of information from King Sweyn II, for whom Adam shows appreciation and respect in his writing. King Sweyn II was a close ally of Skjalm Hvide, including in the Battle of Nis√• in 1062. Sweyn II's grandson Canute Lavard and great- grandson Valdemar I ‚Äì a future King of Denmark ‚Äì were both brought up by Skjalm Hvide and his family. A facsimile of Adam of Bremen's magnum opus. The existence of Adam's Gesta was forgotten in the later medieval era, until it was re-discovered in the late 16th century in the library of Sor√∏ Abbey, founded in 1140 by sons of Skjalm Hvide, Ebbe Skjalmsen (Hvide) and Asser Rig. The stay of Adam of Bremen at the court of Sweyn II gave Adam the opportunity to gather information about the geography and history of Denmark and other Nordic regions and peoples. Among the things Adam wrote about in Scandinavia were the sailing passages across √òresund ‚Äì the strait which forms the Danish‚ÄìSwedish border, separating Zealand (Denmark) from Scania (Sweden) ‚Äì, such as what today is known as the ferry route from Elsinore to Helsingborg. About Zealand, the home island of Skjalm Hvide, Adam of Bremen also wrote e.g. the following words, which are believed to have been influenced by the earlier Viking raids done in the German home-region of Adam, including the sack of Hamburg by the Danes in 845:\\"Ancient See of Hamburg-Bremen.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1913. > \\"There is a lot of gold in Zealand [Seland], which has been obtained by > looting. These pirates, who call themselves Vikings [wichings], pay the king > of the Danes taxes for their right to plunder the barbarians inhabiting the > coasts of the sea.\\" In his account pertaining to the Nordic areas, Descriptio insularum Aquilonis, the book 4 of Adam's \\"Gesta\\", published in c. 1076, Adam was the firstSaksalaispappi Pohjolassa (\\"A German priest in the Nordics\\").

According to Adam of Bremen, this information too he had received from King Sweyn II. The main focus of Gesta was, however, aimed at the history of the Hamburg-Bremen diocese and its bishops. As the jurisdiction of the bishops of the diocese included missions related to the Christianization of Scandinavia, in Gesta Adam reports also of the Norse paganism of the period. The existence of Adam's Gesta was forgotten in the later medieval era, until it was re-discovered in the late 16th century in the library of Sor√∏ Abbey, founded in 1140 by sons of Skjalm Hvide, Ebbe Skjalmsen (Hvide) and Asser Rig, on a land previously owned by Skjalm Hvide.  Skjalm Hvide's immediate family  Skjalm Hvide had at least one brother, Aude, who ‚Äì in the words of Saxo Grammaticus ‚Äì\\"belonged to one of the most distinguished families\\". Skjalm and his wife Signe Asbj√∏rnsdatter (c. 1050 ‚Äì c. 1096) gave birth to Asser Rig Skjalmsen Hvide (c. 1078‚Äì1151) (a jarl and chieftain); Margrethe Skjalmsdatter Hvide (1073‚Äì1162); Cecilie Skjalmsdatter Hvide (c. 1084 ‚Äì 1161); Toke Skjalmsen Hvide (1085‚Äì1145); Sune Skjalmsen Hvide (c. 1086 ‚Äì c. 1140); and Ebbe Skjalmsen Hvide af Knardrup (c. 1090 ‚Äì 1151).Hvidesl√¶gten (\\"Hvide family\\"), Ebbe Skjalmsen, by Roskildes Historie, roskildehistorie.dk. Skjalm's son Asser Rig married Inger Eriksdotter (c. 1100‚Äì1157), the daughter of Eric, the Jarl of Falster, and Princess Cecilia Knutsdatter, the daughter of King Canute IV of Denmark (c. 1042 ‚Äì 10 July 1086), the first Danish king (1080‚Äì1086) to be canonized, recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as the Patron Saint of Denmark in 1101. Asser and Inger settled to live in Fjenneslev, Zealand, where they erected the Fjenneslev Church (Fjenneslev Kirke) in Sor√∏. They gave birth to Absalon (c. 1128 ‚Äì 21 March 1201), who became the Bishop of Roskilde, Archbishop of Lund, and a powerful warrior leader, government minister and main adviser and ally to two Danish kings. The other two children of Asser and Inger were Esbern Snare (c. 1127‚Äì1204) and Ingefred Assersdatter (c. 1130‚Äì1160). Absalon's grandfather ‚Äì Asser's father ‚Äì Skjalm Hvide was originally buried in Fjenneslev, but was later moved to Sor√∏ Klosterkirke (i.e. the Sor√∏ Abbey Church). At Skjalm's tomb an inscription in a lead-plate, believed to be from the late 12th century, states that Absalon's grandfather Skjalm is here. Whereas Skjalm Hvide brought up Canute Lavard, the father of Valdemar I, Canute's son Valdemar I was brought up by Skjalm's son Asser. Asser's son Absalon and stepson Valdemar I became great friends. Before the mid-12th century, an era of Danish warfare and expansion broke out, led by Absalon for ‚Äì and together with ‚Äì his stepbrother Valdemar I. The unrest was started by a Danish civil war fought in 1146‚Äì1157, which led to Valdemar in 1157 being crowned as King Valdemar I of Denmark, a.k.a. Valdemar the Great (reign: 1157‚Äì1182). Thereafter, Absalon remained a war commander, minister and chief adviser first to Valdemar I and then ‚Äì following the death of Valdemar I in 1182 ‚Äì to his successor, King Canute VI (reign: 1182‚Äì1202). After the civil war, Absalon led warring against the Wends, just like his grandfather Skjalm Hvide had done. At Absalon's instigation, Valdemar I declared war upon the Wends, who were raiding the Danish coasts. In 1158, Valdemar I erected the S√∏nderborg Castle (Valdemar IV of Denmark and Helvig of Schleswig were married there two centuries later) for protection against the Wends and as part of a larger system of fortifications. In 1175, Valdemar I also erected the Vordingborg Castle as a defensive fortress, and as a base from which to launch raids against the German coast. After the death of Absalon in 1201, Valdemar II (reign: 1202‚Äì1241) ‚Äì the second son of Absalon's stepbrother Valdemar I ‚Äì led a Danish expedition across the Elbe river to invade Holstein, the region between the rivers Elbe and Eider. Holstein is the southern half of Schleswig- Holstein, which is the northernmost modern-day state of Germany.About Vordingborg Castle (Museerne.dk).Otto Norn, J√∏rgen Paulsen and J√∏rgen Slettebo, S√∏nderborg Slot.

Skjalm Hvide brought up Canute Lavard  In c. 1102, Skjalm Hvide undertook the task of providing home and care ‚Äì in addition to his own biological children ‚Äì to Canute Lavard (Danish: Knud Lavard) (March 12, 1096 ‚Äì 7 January 1131). Canute Lavard was the eldest and only legitimate son of King Eric I of Denmark (c. 1055 ‚Äì 10 July 1103; reigned in 1095‚Äì1103) (Eric I, Eric the Good; Danish: Erik Ejegod, a son of King Sweyn II) and Queen Boedil Thurgotsdatter. Both Eric I and Boedil were descendants of King Sweyn I of Denmark. This mission of Skjalm Hvide began when Canute Lavard's parents, King Eric I and Queen Boedil embarked for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. On their pilgrimage, both Eric I and Boedil died. On their way to the Holy Land, first Eric I became ill, and on 10 July 1103 died in Paphos, Cyprus. Queen Boedil also became ill, but made it to Jerusalem, where she died that same year. At the death of his parents, Canute Lavard was seven years old, and ‚Äì as a minor ‚Äì he was bypassed as the heir for the throne. Under the care of Skjalm Hvide, and with the assistance of Skjalm's brother Aude, Canute thereafter grew up to become a chivalrous and popular Danish prince. The Hvide family members were his most eager supporters. Canute became the first Duke of Schleswig and ‚Äì subsequently ‚Äì the first so-called border-prince, who was both a Danish and German vassal at the same time, a position leading towards the historical double position of Southern Jutland. Canute was an ancestor of the Valdemarian kings (Valdemarerne) and of their corresponding royal line. He was the father of King Valdemar I of Denmark (14 January 1131 ‚Äì 12 May 1182) (Valdemar den Store) and grandfather of King Valdemar II of Denmark (Valdemar Sejr). The reign of King Valdemar I saw the rise of Denmark, which reached its zenith under his second son, and successor, King Valdemar II of Denmark. In 1115, Canute Lavard's uncle, King Niels of Denmark, placed Canute in charge of the Duchy of Schleswig (jarl af S√∏nderjylland), in order to put an end to the attacks of the Slavic Obotrites. During the next fifteen years, he fulfilled his duty of establishing peace in the border area so well that he was titled Duke of Holstein (Hertug af Holsten) and became a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1131, Canute Lavard was killed by his cousin Magnus, (later King Magnus I of Sweden) (a.k.a. Magnus the Strong) (c. 1106‚Äì1134), who saw Canute as a rival to the Danish throne. Canute's murder took place just days before the birth of his son, Valddemar (14 January 1131 ‚Äì 12 May 1182). Valdemar's mother, Ingeborg of Kiev, daughter of Grand Prince Mstislav I of Kiev and Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden, named the son as Valdemar after her grandfather, Vladimir Monomakh, the Grand Prince of Kiev. Canute Lavard was canonized in 1169 by Pope Alexander III.  Skjalm Hvide's son brought up Canute's son  Valdemar the Great (reign: 1154 ‚Äì 12 May 1182) in the town square of Ringsted in central Zealand. As Canute Lavard's son, and as an heir to the throne, and with his rivals quickly gaining power, Valdemar (future King Valdemar I of Denmark) too was adopted to the Hvide family, to be brought up in Ringsted, at the court of Skjalm Hvide's son Asser Rig (Hvide). Asser's son Absalon became a great and trusted friend of his new stepbrother, Valdemar, and Valdemar's chief adviser and ‚Äì later ‚Äì a minister, powerful war commander, Bishop of the Diocese of Roskilde (1158‚Äì1192) and Archbishop of Lund (1178‚Äì1201). In 1154, at his coronation, Valdemar became the King Valdemar I of Denmark, also known as Valdemar the Great (). He reigned until his death in 1182. Before that, in 1146, when Valdemar was only fifteen years old, King Eric III of Denmark abdicated and a Danish civil war erupted. The pretenders to the throne were (1) Sweyn III of Denmark, the son of King Eric II of Denmark and grandson of King Eric I of Denmark; and (2) Canute V of Denmark, the son of Magnus I of Sweden and grandson of Niels of Denmark, who succeeded as king his brother Eric I of Denmark; and (3) Valdemar I himself, who held in his possession Jutland ‚Äì the peninsula of Northern Europe which forms the continental portion of Denmark and part of northern Germany ‚Äì, but most tightly of it the area of Schleswig, located around the modern-day Danish-German border. In 1157, the three agreed to divide Denmark in three between themselves. Sweyn III hosted a great banquet for Canute V, Absalon, and Valdemar I, during which he planned to kill all three. Canute V was killed, but Absalon and Valdemar I escaped. Valdemar I at this point returned to Jutland. Sweyn III quickly launched an invasion there, but only to be defeated by Valdemar I in the Battle of Grathe Heath on 23 October 1157. Consequently, Sweyn III was killed during a fight, allegedly by a group of peasants who stumbled upon him as he was fleeing from the battlefield. In total, the Danish civil war had by then lasted over ten years. Valdemar I, now having outlived all his rival pretenders, became the sole King of Denmark. In 1157, King Valdemar I was married to Sophia of Minsk (c. 1140 ‚Äì 5 May 1198). In 1158, Absalon was appointed the Bishop of Roskilde (1158‚Äì1192), and later the Archbishop of Lund (1178‚Äì1201), while all along serving as the chief adviser, war commander and a minister for his stepbrother, the King Valdemar I of Denmark. At Absalon's instigation, Valdemar I declared war upon the Wends, who were raiding the Danish coasts. In 1158, Valdemar I erected the S√∏nderborg Castle for protection against attacks by the Wends and as part of a larger system of fortifications, and in 1175 the Vordingborg Castle as a defensive fortress, and as a base from which to launch raids against the German coast.  Skjalm Hvide's sons founded Sor√∏ Abbey  Around the lifetime of Skjalm Hvide, it was common practice for the wealthy and powerful to found religious houses, most typically for the following reasons: Expiation of a sinful life; to gain a stage to arrange commemorative and religious masses and events; to have a venue to provide services for the poor; or just out of religious zeal or devotion; or for any combination of the above. Accordingly, on a land owned by Skjalm Hvide until his death in c. 1113, his sons Ebbe Skjalmsen and Asser Rig in 1140 founded the Sor√∏ Abbey, which became the preeminent and wealthiest monastic house in all of Denmark during the Middle Ages. It acquired property all over Denmark, with an income larger than that of the royal family. Near Sor√∏, Ebbe also erected the Bjernede Church, and Asser established a Benedictine House, just a few years before his death in 1151. Asser lived as a monk for the last years of his life. A decade after the passing of Ebbe and Asser in 1151, Asser's son Absalon in 1161 founded the town of Sor√∏ where the Sor√∏ Abbey is located. In 1167, Absalon also founded what became the city Copenhagen. In 1161‚Äì1201, he erected on the abbey grounds Sor√∏ Klosterkirke, i.e. the Sor√∏ Abbey Church. The church became a burial site for the noble Hvide family members, including for Absalon himself in 1201, behind the main altar, when the church construction was completed. It became a burial site also for three Danish kings; Christopher II, Valdemar IV Atterdag, and Oluf II, as well as Queen Margaret I of Denmark, who later was moved to the Roskilde Cathedral (). Today, the Sor√∏ Klosterkirke church remains an excellent example of early Brick Gothic architecture. From 1625 onward, the site of the Sor√∏ Abbey has also been the site of the Sor√∏ Academy (Danish: Sor√∏ Akademis Skole), a well-known educational institution. A lead‚Äìplate with text found at the Sor√∏ Abbey Church, which tells that Absalon's grandfather is here. The text reads in Latin: \\"HIC IACET SCELMO BY DONI ABSALONI ARCHIEPI\\". National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen. The most famous residents of the Sor√∏ Abbey have included the Danish historian, theologian and author Saxo Grammaticus (c. 1150 ‚Äì c. 1220) (\\"Saxo the Literate\\", or \\"Saxo the Learned\\", literally \\"Saxo the Grammarian\\", a.k.a. Saxo cognomine Longus), who was born around the time when Skjalm Hvide's sons Ebbe Skjalmsen and Asser Rig ‚Äì the founders of the Sor√∏ Abbey ‚Äì are believed to have died (both in c. 1151). Saxo the Tall (Danish: Lange), as he was called at Sor√∏, only later became called \\"Grammaticus\\", as a result of his excellently written Latin. Saxo's skill as a Latinist was praised by Erasmus, who wondered how \\"a Dane of that age got so great power of eloquence\\". Based on Saxo's writings, he is believed to have been either a clerk or secretary to Archbishop Absalon, the son of Asser Rig and grandson of Skjalm Hvide.  Saxo Grammaticus at Sor√∏ Abbey  Saxo Grammaticus, drawn by the Norwegian illustrator Louis Moe. On the invitation from Absalon, Saxo Grammaticus wrote Gesta Danorum (\\"Deeds of the Danes\\") at the Sor√∏ Abbey. It is a patriotic work describing Danish and ‚Äì to some degree ‚Äì other Nordic and Baltic history, from prehistory to the late 12th century. It consists of sixteen books written in Latin. It is the most ambitious literary undertaking of medieval Denmark and an essential source for the nation's early history, and also one of the oldest known written documents about the history of Estonia and Latvia. Additionally, Gesta Danorum offers singular reflections on European affairs in the High Middle Ages, from a unique Scandinavian perspective. From Gesta Danorum, the legend of Amleth came to inspire the story of Hamlet by Shakespeare (The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark). Saxo is thought to have started writing Gesta Danorum in c. 1185. His writings reveal that he was in the retinue ‚Äì and received the patronage ‚Äì of Absalon, who was the foremost adviser to King Valdemar I. In his will, Absalon forgives his clerk Saxo a small debt of two and a half silver marks, and instructs Saxo to return two borrowed books to the monastery of Sor√∏. Saxo is believed to have finished Gesta Danorum by writing the preface for it as the work's last step, in c. 1216, while then being under the patronage of Anders Sunesen, who became the Archbishop of Lund after the death of Absalon in 1201. Anders Sunesen was a nephew of Absalon and a great-grandson of Skjalm Hvide, and ‚Äì accordingly ‚Äì a member of the religious and political elite. Anders was well-traveled, having received his education in theology and philosophy in Paris, France, and his legal education in Bologna, Italy and at Oxford, England. Together with his brother, Anders led a crusade against the Finns in 1202, and in 1219 accompanied Valdemar II in his war against Estonia. In the preface of Gesta Danorum, Saxo included a warm appreciation of both Archbishops of Lund, Absalon and Anders Sunesen, as well as the reigning King Valdemar II. In the preface, Saxo writes that his patron Absalon, the Archbishop of Lund, had encouraged him to write a heroic history of the Danes. Although Saxo Grammaticus is commonly viewed by the modern-day Danes as their \\"first national historian\\", two other coherent accounts of Danish history by Danish authors predate Gesta Danorum. The earliest one is Chronicon Roskildense (English: Roskilde Chronicle), a small work written in Latin, completed in c. 1143, spanning from the introduction of Christianity in Denmark to the author's own time. The next Danish historiography to be published was Brevis historia regum Dacie, written by Sven Aggesen (b. c. 1140‚Äì1150 ‚Äì death unknown), thought to have been finished in 1186 or 1187 (the last event described happened in 1185), covering the years 300‚Äì1185. Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 1.Inge Skovgaard-Petersen, in Knut Helle, ed. The Cambridge History of Scandinavia, vol. I, p. 355. Importantly, after the death in 1201 of his patron Absalon, Saxo Grammaticus appears to have changed his agenda. What eventually came to be the first nine books of Gesta Danorum, were actually written after the death of Absalon, and they focus largely on mythology, for which Saxo has been criticized for. The contrast to the seven books written during the lifetime of Absalon is \\"enormous\\", leading the main core of scholars to divide the two parts into mythical (books I‚ÄìIX) and historical (books X‚ÄìXVI), the last of the historical books being based on Absalon's memories. Therefore, we prefer to support the composition order of Gesta Danorum as X‚ÄìXVI, followed by I‚ÄìIX, and ending with the preface, says historian Andr√© Muceniecks from the Department of History at University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.\\"The ‚ÄòThematic of the Counselor‚Äô in the Gesta Danorum and the Strengthening of the Danish Hegemony in the medieval Baltic Area.\\" An abstract of a study by Andr√© Muceniecks.

The castle was built to obtain control of a key route between London and the Midlands during the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century. Robert of Mortain, William the Conqueror's half brother, was probably responsible for managing its construction, after which he became the castle's owner. The castle was surrounded by protective earthworks and a deer park for hunting. The castle became a new administrative centre of the former Anglo- Saxon settlement of Berkhamsted. Subsequent kings granted the castle to their chancellors. The castle was substantially expanded in the mid-12th century, probably by Thomas Becket. The castle was besieged in 1216 during the civil war between King John and rebellious barons, who were supported by France. It was successfully captured after Prince Louis, the future Louis VIII, attacked it with siege engines for twenty days, forcing the garrison to surrender. After being retaken by royal forces the subsequent year, it was given to Richard, Earl of Cornwall, beginning a long association with the Earldom of Cornwall and the later duchy. Richard redeveloped the castle as a palatial residence, and made it the centre of the earldom's administration. Edward III further developed the castle in the 14th century and gave it to his son, Edward, the Black Prince, who expanded the hunting grounds. The castle was also used to hold royal prisoners, including John II of France and rival claimants to the English throne. In the late 15th century, the castle became increasingly unfashionable and fell into decline. By the mid-16th century, it was in ruins and unsuitable for royal use. Stone was taken from the castle to build houses and other buildings in the town. The castle was almost destroyed during the construction of the London and Birmingham Railway in the 1830s. As a result, it became the first building in Britain to receive statutory protection from Parliament. In 1930, the castle passed from the Duchy of Cornwall to the government's control. It is maintained as a tourist attraction by English Heritage. History=1066‚Äì1217 Berkhamsted Castle was built during the Norman conquest of England in 1066. After William the Conqueror defeated the Anglo-Saxons at the Battle of Hastings he advanced from the coast, across the Thames Valley and north into Hertfordshire. Chroniclers suggest that the Archbishop of York surrendered to William in Berkhamsted, and William probably ordered the construction of the castle before proceeding south into London.; Berkhamsted was strategically significant, as it lay on a key route into the Midlands from London through the Chiltern Hills. The actual construction work was probably overseen by William's half-brother, Robert of Mortain, who owned it by the time of the writing of the Domesday Book.; ; Plan of the castle: A ‚Äì earthworks, possibly for French siege engines; B ‚Äì motte and keep; C ‚Äì inner bailey; D ‚Äì Richard, Earl of Cornwall's tower; E ‚Äì 19th century keeper's house; F ‚Äì outer bailey; G ‚Äì south gate The castle was located slightly away from the main road, to give additional space for the earthworks involved, and was positioned as to benefit from natural springs running down from under the hill. It had a motte and bailey design, with a high motte, and a bailey around by , enclosing acres. A double bank and ditch ran around the whole castle, with both sets of ditches filled with water.; ; ; In total, the wider earthworks occupy around . A fossarius ‚Äì a specialised ditch digger ‚Äì was recorded as being employed maintained at the castle in 1086. Radiocarbon dating of organic remains from within the castle's motte indicates a post 1066 construction date. A large deer park, owned by the Crown, was established around the castle to provide hunting grounds.; The castle was carefully positioned next to the park, which was overlooked by the motte. A vineyard was also maintained alongside the castle. The old Anglo- Saxon manorial centre was moved to the site, and as a result the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Berkhamsted may have shifted from the area now called Northchurch along Akeman Street to be closer to the castle; several mills, essential for grinding flour, were present there in 1086. Robert's son, William rebelled against Henry I and the castle was confiscated. Henry granted Berkhamsted to his chancellor, Ranulf. In 1123, however, when Ranulf was travelling to the castle with Henry, the chancellor rode over the nearby hill, became overly exhilarated at the view ahead of him and fell off his horse, dying from his injuries.; The castle was subsequently given by Henry II to Thomas Becket when he became chancellor in 1155. Becket extended the castle to accommodate his large household, but fell from favour in 1164 and the castle was confiscated by the king. Henry II liked Berkhamsted and subsequently used it himself extensively. By the mid-12th century, the castle had been rebuilt in stone, probably by Becket, with a shell keep and an outer stone wall; the bailey was divided in two by a wall to form an inner and an outer bailey.; ; A gatehouse led down into the town, meeting with Castle Street. Henry II also officially recognised the surrounding settlement of Berkhamsted as a town in 1156. Under King John the castle was part of the lands forming the jointure of his second wife Isabella. John entrusted the castle to Geoffrey Fitz Peter in 1206, who rebuilt much of the town.; Geoffrey died in 1213 and the castle passed to his son, John Fitzgeoffrey. Political tensions in England began to rise, however, and a potential conflict between King John and an alliance of rebel barons opposed to his rule began to look likely. In early 1215, King John installed a trusted German mercenary called Ranulph in charge of Berkhamsted Castle and reviewed the defensive arrangements there that April. Civil war broke out later that same year. Initially, the rebels were hampered by a lack of equipment ‚Äì in particular, siege engines ‚Äì but in May 1216 the future Louis VIII crossed over the English Channel joining the rebel cause and being proclaimed king in London, bringing with him heavy siege equipment. King John died in October, and in December Louis besieged Berkhamsted Castle. The prince deployed his siege engines, probably trebuchets, and attacked the castle repeatedly for twenty days, throwing what chroniclers termed innumerable \\"damnable stones\\" at the defenders.; ; During the 13th century, a set of earthworks were built around the outside of the walls, which may have been the firing platforms for these trebuchets. Having put up a strong defence, the garrison was allowed to surrender and to leave with their weapons and armour.; When the forces loyal to the young Henry III defeated the rebels the following year, the castle was returned to royal hands. 1218‚Äì1461 Castle motte In subsequent years, Berkhamsted then became closely associated with the Earls and Dukes of Cornwall. Henry III's brother, Richard, became the Earl of Cornwall and inherited the castle from his mother Isabella, and it became a permanent part of the earldom. Berkhamsted was Richard's favourite castle, partially because it was conveniently close to London. Richard had an impressive, three-storey tower built onto the property in 1254, and restored much of the rest of the castle; the chroniclers of nearby Dunstable complained that his building works required so many carts to carry the timber that local trade in other goods was badly affected.; The castle was used for the central administration of the earldom and Richard's nine stewards would submit their annual financial reports there. Meanwhile, the town of Berkhamsted itself became rich as a result of the growing wool trade. Richard died at the castle in 1272, and it passed to his son Edmund. The castle passed on through Edward I, who found the castle in an apparently poor condition, and his second wife, Margaret, to Edward II.; Edward II gave it to his royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, whom he made Earl of Cornwall. Gaveston was married there in 1307, with Edward in attendance. Edward II and Gaveston fell from power in 1327 and John, Edward's second son, took possession as the new Earl of Cornwall. When John died, Edward III reclaimed Berkhamsted Castle; a survey showed it to be in need of substantial repairs. Edward had not yet improved Windsor Castle, so used Berkhamsted as his main property, investing considerable sums in renovating it. His son, Edward, the Black Prince, was created Duke of Cornwall and also made extensive use of the castle, which formed part of the new duchy. The Black Prince took advantage of the aftermath of the Black Death to extend the castle's park by , including some woodland pasture stretching over the Chilterns, eventually producing a park covering . The castle was used to hold John II of France after he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Poitiers. When the Black Prince fell ill following his campaigning in France, he retired to Berkhamsted and died there in 1376.. Richard II inherited Berkhamsted Castle in 1377; initially the use of it was given to his favourite, Robert de Vere and, after de Vere's fall from power and exile in 1388, to John Holland.; Henry IV lived in the castle after he deposed Richard in 1400, and he used the property to detain rival applicants to the throne. During this period Geoffrey Chaucer, later famous for his Canterbury Tales, oversaw renovation work on the castle in his role as a clerk. Both Henry V and Henry VI owned the castle, the latter making use of it until his overthrow in 1461. 1462‚Äì1900 View from the motte, looking into the inner bailey Berkhamsted was confiscated by Edward IV when he came to power during Wars of the Roses. In the late 15th century, the castle was occupied by his mother, Cecily Neville, the Duchess of York. By now the castle had become increasingly unfashionable, however, and was abandoned after her death in 1495. By the time that antiquarian John Leland visited in the mid-16th century, it was in \\"much ruine\\" and was unsuitable for royal use. In 1580, the estate, including the ruins and the park, was leased from Elizabeth I by Sir Edward Carey, for the nominal rent of one red rose each year.; Stone from the castle was used to build Berkhamsted Place, a local school and other buildings in the late 16th century. The castle's park, which had reached in size by 1627, was broken up in the next two decades, shrinking to only . The English Civil War of the 1640s largely passed Berkhamsted by, with the castle apparently playing no part in the conflict. In 1761 the wider estate and the castle were separated, the former being leased to the Duke of Bridgewater, while the latter remained in the direct control of the Duchy of Cornwall. In 1863, the surrounding estates and park were sold off altogether by the duchy to Earl Brownlow; Brownlow also agreed to rent the castle from the duchy for a nominal rent.; In the 1830s, plans were drawn up to build the new London and Birmingham Railway. From an engineering perspective, the ideal route for the railway ran through the site of the castle, but concerns over the need to protect ancient monuments and buildings had been growing for several years, and the local Bridgwater estate were also keen to protect the local view from their buildings.; The castle was ultimately specifically protected in the 1833 act that sanctioned the railway, forcing the track to take a route across the valley floor. Berkhamsted was the first building in Britain to receive statutory protection from development in this way. Nonetheless, the route still required the track to pass through the outer fortifications of the castle, a major engineering operation which was carried out in 1834, destroying the castle gatehouse in the process. 20th ‚Äì 21st centuries Ruins of the external walls, keeper's house, castle motte in background The Office of Works acquired Berkhamsted Castle from the Duchy of Cornwall in 1930. The inner ditch was subsequently drained of water in the 1950s. In the 21st century it is operated as a tourist attraction by English Heritage, and historian Isobel Thompson considers it \\"one of the best surviving motte and bailey castles\\" in England. The castle is protected by law as an ancient monument.

Although Green never claimed to have definitively seen a ghost, he hunted them for sixty years and helped to popularise the use of scientific methods in ghost hunting. He once famously hunted for ghosts in the Royal Albert Hall. Biography Green was born in Ealing; his father was senior Air Raid Warden to the area. Green's interest in the paranormal was sparked when his father took him to an empty Victorian house in 1944. He later said that while visiting the house he was overcome by an unearthly voice who told him to jump out of the window. On investigation Green discovered that the house had been the site of twenty suicides over the previous sixty years. Green took a picture of the window he almost jumped from on his way out of the house. When it came back from the developers, Green discovered the face of a young girl in the window. This image would appear on many of his later book covers. Green was educated at Borderstone Grammar School and received his science degree and masters in philosophy from the London School of Economics. Although he hunted ghosts for a living, Green did not believe in life after death and remained a staunch humanist throughout his life. Green never claimed to have seen a ghost, except for the ghost of a fox terrier in the early fifties, and even that he could never claim to be sure about. Green met his second wife, Norah Cawthorne, through his investigations in 1976. They were married from 1979 until Green's death in May 2004. Career Green began hunting ghosts in the early forties and was known for his attempts to study ghosts from a scientific perspective. His paranormal investigations were interrupted by two years of National Service in the army, but as soon as he was finished he began his paranormal career. In 1949 Green founded the Ealing Society for Psychical Research and in 1952 he co-founded the Lewisham Psychic Research Society and the National Federation of Psychic Research Societies; he continued his ghost investigations. During this time he also carried out ESP investigations and tested mediums. Nothing came of this research. After working as a magazine editor Green decided to create his own publishing company and soon published multiple volumes. In 1973 he published his first notable work, Our Haunted Kingdom which was a directory of all English ghosts who had been reported over the previous 25 years. In the same year however, he also published his definitive work, Ghost Hunting, a Practical Guide, which was the world's first book devoted to scientific ghost-hunting techniques including the use of thermometers and tape-recorders. During this time, Green also appeared on Radio 4's programme You the Jury to debate the existence of ghosts, as well as appearing in the TV Times and Police Review. Whilst investigating a poltergeist in Battersea, Green came across a letter supposedly written by the spirit. This earned him a Guinness Book of Records entry as the only person to own a \\"letter from a poltergeist\\". The letter was later found to be fraudulently written by the owners of the house. Green was called in by numerous organisations as a consultant, including the Disney Corporation. In 2002 Green also gave advice to model Jordan regarding ghosts in her new home and in 2004 he advised singer Robbie Williams in a similar manner. Every year Green would deliver a lecture on parapsychology at Pyke House, Battle and in 2003 he was honoured by their Ghost Club for his 60 years of research. Green also gave evening classes in parapsychology at Hastings College. The Royal Albert Hall In 1996 Green was called on to investigate a haunting at the Royal Albert Hall. A caterer's porter had claimed seeing two ladies in the hall's basement who subsequently disappeared. Workmen also reported being harassed by an old man wearing a skull cap whenever they went to repair the organ. Eventually, Green was called by Mark Borkowski, the hall's PR consultant, who said he did not believe in ghosts, but that the workers were too nervous about the area. Borkowski invited the media to Green's exorcism and instead of chasing ghosts Green spent the night answering questions posed by the media. However, Green claimed that before the media had arrived he has noticed an anomaly in the temperature of the top floor, which was hotter over a spot where two workmen drowned in the Serpentine River, and that his bat recorder had picked up some noise.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and broadcasts a rhythmic adult contemporary format. The KFBT studios are located on Shaw Avenue in North Fresno, and the transmitter tower is south of Fresno near Caruthers. KFBT broadcasts in HD radio. History The station at 103.7 FM first signed on in 1976 as KIOY. In the late 1970s, the station broadcast a contemporary hit radio (CHR, also called top 40) format known as \\"K104 FM\\" from its studios in a vineyard between Fresno and Hanford. KMGX (1982-1989) In the early 1980s, the station changed its call sign to KMGX and its branding to \\"The New Magic 104 FM\\" while retaining the CHR format. Throughout the 1980s, KMGX remained competitive with rival KBOS, known at the time by the on-air moniker of \\"Rockradio K-Boss 95 FM\\". Playlists from 1985 show Magic 104 give heavy airplay to dance-oriented artists such as Sheena Easton, Prince, and Teena Marie, while K-Boss emphasized rock music from the likes of Billy Squier, Bruce Springsteen, and David Lee Roth. In the late 1980s, KMGX adopted the moniker \\"The All New X104\\". X104 was one of the first radio stations in the US to blend the CHR and urban format into a fully fledged \\"churban\\" format (later known as rhythmic contemporary). The station's appeal grew to dominant audience shares within Fresno's Latino community throughout the 1980s. At its peak in popularity, the station hosted the largest single Latino audience share of any general market radio station in the US at 70 percent. KMGX's success is attributed to its high appeal among second- and third-generation Mexican Americans who gravitated towards morning drive host Richard Cano, as well as the popularity of evening host Kid Landon among younger listeners. The Fresno State alumnus served previously as a KYNO disc jockey and program director at KBOS, returning to Fresno in 1984 and claiming some of the highest morning ratings in the history of the market. Sales manager Chuck Lontine, who joined the station from the San Francisco radio market, created a \\"Spanglish\\" (bilingual English/Spanish) sales and marketing strategy that sustained the station throughout the 1980s. By the end of the decade, however, KMGX began to lose audience share to a growing number of Spanish-language stations in the market, leading to the discontinuation of the churban format in mid-1989. KRZR (1989-2010) Logo for KRZR as a rock station, used until October 2010. In June 1989, KGMX flipped to a current-based rock format, changing its call sign to KRZR in August. This new iteration of 103.7 FM was launched by Southern California broadcasting veteran Jim Votaw, X104 exec Chuck Lontine, and programmer Brian Burns. At the time, the station was owned by Olympia Broadcasting of Seattle. KRZR introduced the \\"rock 40\\" format ‚Äî a youth- targeted hybrid of CHR and album-oriented rock that combines the formatics of the former with the music mix of the latter ‚Äî to the Fresno radio market. (This concept later evolved to what is now known as active rock, and KRZR was one of the first stations to air the format.) The station was initially patterned after Olympia's successful rock 40 station KXXR in Kansas City, Missouri and Westwood One-owned KQLZ (Pirate Radio) in Los Angeles. KRZR's first slogan was \\"Today's Rock 'N' Roll\\", and the station played glam metal artists and those representing related subgenres of hard rock who otherwise would have difficulty getting radio airplay. One prominent promotion was a weekly giveaway of $10,000 to randomly spotted owners of cars sporting the station's bumper/window stickers, who called into the studio within an allotted time. The original KRZR airstaff included program director E. Curtis Johnson (previously with KCAQ in Oxnard), music director and afternoon drive host Brian Degus (known on-air as \\"McFly\\"), morning show host Pete Hansen, and newswoman Kelly Boom. Midday shifts were filled by Kevin Musso (\\"Nick NRG\\") and Larry \\"Sparky\\" Long (\\"Larry The Pocket Producer\\") ‚Äî the latter an 18-year- old high school intern from Clovis. Rounding out the staff were Chris Daniel in evenings and Scott Stevens in overnights, and part-time/weekender, Dave Rodgers, who also worked for two years at KMGX X104. Dave was the last DJ on KMGX when it flipped. In July 1989, former KCLQ DJ Clay Steiner (using the on- air name \\"Matt 'The Healer' Clayton\\") hired on for weekends and overnights. Long was hired that same month for fill-in shifts. KRZR had a mascot known as \\"The Wild Hare\\", created by Johnson in 1993. According to him, the hare represented the irreverent attitude of the station and its rock mix. KRZR used the Wild Hare on a variety of promotional materials, including a series of T-shirts with puns referring to rock bands, or people or events in popular culture (examples included \\"Haretallica\\", \\"Bat-Hare Forever\\", and Tig-Hare Woods\\"). The station was so popular that management had trouble meeting the heavy demand for promotional materials, often selling out of T-shirts. Shortly after the debut of KRZR, both Burns and Lontine left the company. Brian Burns became a renowned program consultant and radio programmer, while Chuck Lontine joined WLS in Chicago. Kevin Musso became a television weatherman in Fresno. Pete Hansen eventually moved on to The DSC Show at KGB-FM in San Diego; he also hosts a podcast, The Pete Hansen Show. Larry \\"Sparky\\" Long now lives and works in Northern California. E. Curtis Johnson remained in the Fresno market after leaving KRZR in 2007, assuming the program director position at One Putt Broadcasting from 2008 to 2014, followed by the same role at Lotus Communications' active rock outlet KKBZ in April 2019. Dave Rodgers (Ken Richards) remained on KRZR until October 2003, continued at KJUG FM in Visalia (2004-2011)and is now at KUZZ FM in Bakersfield doing weekends. (2014‚ÄìPresent) KFBT (2010-present) On October 6, 2010 at noon, after playing Rage Against the Machine's \\"Freedom\\", KRZR changed its format from active rock to rhythmic adult contemporary. The station changed its call letters to KFBT and its branding to \\"103.7 The Beat\\". The KRZR personalities were dismissed and the rock format moved to its HD2 digital subchannel. The first song on \\"The Beat\\" was \\"Get Ready for This\\" by 2 Unlimited. HD Radio KFBT broadcasts in HD Radio on two digital subchannels: *KFBT-HD1 airs a digital simulcast of the analog signal. *KFBT-HD2 broadcasts a Hispanic rhythmic format known as \\"Fiesta Latina\\", a bilingual presentation featuring urban, pop, and regional Mexican music.

It is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The building was built in 1933 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The first courthouse built on this location was completed in 1892, serving as a courthouse until 1911, when it was succeeded by the erection of a separate courthouse entirely in Texas. The Texas-only courthouse later became the Texarkana Regional Arts Center. The earlier, border-straddling building continued to serve the Arkansas district alone until it was razed in 1930 to make way for the new construction, which was completed in 1933. Significance Since its construction in 1931, the United States Post Office and Courthouse has remained the most prominent structure in Texarkana, due in no small measure to its location. The regularity of the downtown street grid is interrupted by the north-south path of State Line Avenue, which separates Texas and Arkansas. Located between Fifth and Sixth Streets, the federal building ensures its pivotal presence by occupying the sole site in the center of State Line Avenue. By straddling the boundary between two states, the building uniquely evinces its federal nature and function; no other federal building in the country is sited in two states.General Services Administration page on the United States Post Office and Courthouse. At least twelve buildings, including the original U.S. Post Office and Courthouse and the Central Christian Church, were demolished or relocated to accommodate this new federal building, which significantly altered the street pattern. Witt, Seibert & Halsey of Texarkana, in association with Perkins, Chatten & Hammond of Chicago, were responsible for the building's design, with James A. Wetmore the acting supervising architect for the Treasury Department. R. O. Jameson prepared the original structural engineering drawings; R. F. Taylor was the mechanical engineer. The 1888 Texarkana courthouse and post office, razed in 1930 to make way for the new building No large-scale occupancy relocations have occurred and the building has retained most of its original functions, maintaining the stability of its connection with the community. The first floor post office, third floor courtrooms and judicial spaces, as well as many of the offices, still serve the purposes for which they were intended. Though modifications to the postal screen walls were made twice within eight years of construction, the building did not undergo significant change until new air conditioning, plaster soffits, and suspended fluorescent fixtures were added to judicial rooms in 1957. The following year a conveyor areaway and stair were added leading to the basement on the Arkansas side. The 1970s brought more changes to the postal screen walls, as well as the insensitive addition of air conditioning equipment and ductwork with suspended acoustic tile ceilings to the offices on floors two through five. It is critical to the life of the building that its current functions be maintained. Architectural description Though occasional Art Deco features betray its date of construction, the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Texarkana is steadfastly Beaux Arts in form and organization. Symmetrical with respect to the state line, the gray Arkansas Limestone building is a rectangular steel and concrete structure composed of five stories, a full basement, and a service penthouse. The basement and ground floors form a rusticated plinth with a base of Texas Pink granite and recessed joints in the limestone ground floor walls. On the south side, three arched openings penetrate this plinth, expressing depth and serving as the main entry to the building. Limestone walls in running bond pattern clad floors two, three, and four, where windows reveal the presence of each level. The east and west sides of this massive intermediate section of the building are articulated by the projection of the three outer bays at either end and by the presence of Doric pilasters between the seven central bays. Seven Tuscan pilasters likewise march across this portion of the north facade, while on the south elevation four Ionic columns extend upward from the plinth to a limestone entablature that wraps the building at the level of the fifth floor. Above the cornice on the west, north, and east sides, the building steps back considerably from the street facade. On the south, or front, side, this narrower fifth floor remains in plane with the street facade. In addition the fifth floor is capped by a service penthouse at the south end. This means that roughly one third of the height of the main facade exists above the cornice, affording it a much greater prominence than the other facades. The extra mass above the cornice, unusual in a Beaux Arts design, is inscribed with the building's name and is banded with a repeating Art Deco relief pattern in the stone. With exceptions, the original plan strategies are clearly evident in the building today. The second through fifth floors are for the most part organized as a series of perimeter offices opening into a ring of corridors which in turn surround a core consisting of restrooms, service spaces, and a small but effective light court. Two large double-height courtrooms occupy the north end of the third and fourth floors and remain close to original condition. Many of the perimeter spaces have suffered a loss of volume and character from the installation of suspended acoustical tile ceilings. New gypsum board partitions have intruded into the second and fifth floor offices, while one third of the fifth floor corridors have been overtaken as work space. The elevator lobbies on all floors remain largely intact. Although the postal lobby, located immediately beyond the first floor elevator lobby, has undergone repeated modifications since construction, including the introduction of an inappropriate post office box \\"hut\\" and customer corral, it retains much of its original character. Those areas borrowed from the lobby for adjacent postal work rooms continue to exhibit the original plaster ceilings and wood wainscots. Ancillary postal spaces on the building's west side best exhibit the original wood trim, plaster ceilings, and door and transom treatment, though these features can be found in smaller quantities elsewhere in the building.

It was built in the Streamline Moderne style in 1940 and survived the Battle of Manila. It was considered as the finest Art Deco building in Asia, until its demolition. It was demolished in 2000 upon the orders of the Mayor of Manila Lito Atienza amidst protests, to make way for the Manila Hall of Justice, which was never built. Design The building was located adjacent to the old Legislative Building now the National Museum of Fine Arts. Composed of four storeys, the building's Sky Room was \\"the place to be seen\\" in its day. The building's cylindrical glass facade was meant to evoke the velocity of the game, which was then a craze in the city. The building was damaged during the Battle of Manila during World War II but was repaired. Decline While the Sky Room became a venue of meetings and receptions during the Commonwealth and early years after Independence, the building had degenerated into a place of game-rigging, syndication and other forms of cheating. Several murders have been said to have occurred there, as disputes on gambling on the results of jai alai games were prevalent. In 1986, the game per se was banned in the country due to allegations of game fixing. Demolition When Lito Atienza was elected Mayor of Manila in 1998, he immediately undertook several urban renewal projects in the city. One of the targets was the demolition of the now decrepit Jai-Alai Building. The vicinity had been taker over by vagrants, and the games transferred to Harrison Plaza in Malate, Manila. An effort by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), the National Historical Institute (NHI), the Heritage Conservation Society and other heritage conservationists opposed the demolition. Atienza, a frequent bettor on jai alai in his youth, would replace the building with a new building for the city's courts. The conservationists attempted to at least save the building's facade, but were rejected since aside from being inconsistent with the intended function as a court and the building's association with gambling, the facade would be incompatible with the new building's neoclassical style. Post-demolition The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) was given the lot where the building once stood in 2005. The new building for city's courts, on the other hand, will be built on the site of the old GSIS building near Manila City Hall along Arroceros street, beside SM City Manila. On August 22, 2012, there was a so- called \\"ground-breaking\\" for a new House of Justice hall on the lot with the GSIS old building, the eighth such ceremony. The \\"ground-breaking\\" was symbolic and did not signal the start of construction as bidding for the engineering, design and construction had not taken place yet. The demolition led to the passage of the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009 and other efforts to preserve historic buildings, which has had mixed results. The vacant lot behind the building became the site of the Torre de Manila, which is scheduled to be completed in 2019, and is controversial because it is in the sightline of the Rizal Monument.

Most of his poetry concerned the area around his birthplace of Josefsthal causing him to be described as a \\"poet of the Jizera Mountains.\\"  Life  Leutelt was born the son of a teacher in Josefsthal in Jizera Mountains, northern Bohemia, then a part of the Austrian Empire, now the Czech Republic. He was the great grandson of the \\"miracle doctor\\" Josef Johann Kittel. Leutelt settled in Leitmeritz to train at a teacher's training college and work as a teacher at the elementary school of his father. As a senior teacher, he took over the local elementary school in the nearby town of Untermaxdorf (Doln√≠ Maxov) first but later at the training college. At this institution he came in contact with glass workers and he chose this craft as his life's study. In 1906, he founded a museum in Untermaxdorf in which he documented the history and economy of the Upper Kamenice valley. After 1922 he moved as a pensioner near Gablonz an der Nei√üe. As a result of the Bene≈° decrees, Leutelt, an 85-year-old, was expelled from his home in 1946. He died in 1947 in Seebergen, Germany at the age of 86. His grave stone in the cemetery of Seebergen reads: \\"Here rests away his beloved forest homeland, a former champion of German art, Gustav Leutelt, poet of the Jizera Mountains, born in Josefsthal on 21 September 1860; 17 February 1947 died in Seebergen.\\" At the memorial is a plaque: \\"This memorial stone was donated by Gablonzer compatriots of the Jizera Mountains in the Sudetenland from which the people of Thuringia were expelled in 1945. Renewed by the Leutelt Society in Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd in 2002\\".  Quotes  \\"The home is not everything but rather the root system of the rising World Tree. Neither patriotism, as escapism, or the global love for the homeland of contempt are good. Home education is probably not an end in itself, but it should lead to respect from the home. And we must find a way to this, it's possible even for those who are alienated. Global love in our heart for the home is the ultimate.\\"  Awards and honors  * 1935 Joseph-Freiherr-von-Eichendorff-Preis (Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff Prize)  Works  * Schilderungen aus dem Isergebirge, 1899 (Descriptions of the Jizera Mountains, 1899) * Die K√∂nigsh√§user, 1906 (The royal, 1906) * Das zweite Gesicht, 1911 (The Good Son, 1911) * H√ºttenheimat, 1919 (Cottage home, 1919) * Aus den Iserbergen.

The paper contained news pertaining to the Catholic Church as well as Irish and German nationalistic writings. In 1931 Pope Pius XI conferred upon him a Papal honor as a Knight of St. Gregory, upon the nomination of Bishop Henry Rohlman.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983. History James McManus, who built this house, moved to Davenport in the 1840s. He was engaged in farming and retail. McManus was elected to the Iowa General Assembly and served as a Scott County supervisor. His son Parker took over the estate when James died. Parker continued to operate the farm and he was also elected to the state legislature. At one time there were several estates in the West End that lined Telegraph Road at the base of the bluff and were home to prominent families such as the Putnams, Koenigs, Glasspells, and the Fejervarys. The McManus House is the only one that remains. with Architecture This house exemplifies the combination of the Italianate and the Greek Revival styles that were popular in Davenport in the mid-19th century. The two-story house is built of brick and is three bays wide with a doorway in the left bay. The simple bracketed cornice that rings the top of the house, and the low hipped roof evoke the Italianate style. The Greek Revival style is found in the simple window pediments and the wide, glass framed doorway. A porch wraps around the front of the house to the east side. It was built 40 to 50 years after the house and adds the Neoclassical style to the house.

He and his wife Mary moved to Davenport in 1850. His downtown store, Smith's Philadelphia Variety Store, was known for its ‚Äúsplendid stock of fancy goods from numerous buying trips to the East.‚Äù Mary served as the store's assistant manager and was the city's first female clerk. with It is believed he hired one of Davenport's first professional architects, Willett L. Carroll, to design his house in the 1850s. The Smith's sold the store in 1867 and moved to East Davenport where they were engaged in agriculture. After it sat empty for a short time, the house was purchased by J.H. Murphy who was a partner in the law firm of Martin, Murphy and Suksdorf. Architecture The house was designed based on the philosophy of Orson Fowler, a leading phrenologist, who held that the octagon was the closest thing to a circle and it was conducive to good health. While it is one of several octagon houses in the state of Iowa, it is the only one left in Davenport. It is the earliest of the remaining octagon houses in Iowa that was built to the precepts of Fowler who recommended that they employ \\"plank wall\\" construction and a plan adapted from the Howland House, which he published in A Home For All in 1853. The house exhibits features found in the Italianate style: hipped roof, bracketed eaves, and a small belvedere on top, which has subsequently been removed. The entrances into the house are on the main floor, which sits atop a raised basement level. They are all covered by columned porches and are located on the four cardinal points of the compass. The grounds of the estate also featured a carriage house, stable, grape vines and a picket fence, all of which are now gone.

A left-hander, Mayer was Jewish. He played parts of two seasons in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs in 1957 and 1958. He also pitched in the minor leagues from 1952 to 1959. Early life Prior to playing professionally, he attended Lowell High School in San Francisco. After graduating from Lowell in 1950, Ed attended the University of California at Berkeley, where he played baseball for two seasons. An all-around athlete, Ed peaked with a one-hitter against Santa Clara on May 4, 1952, and he went 2-for-4 to help Cal-Berkeley win, 1‚Äì0. After his college experience, Mayer signed with the Boston Red Sox. Baseball career Mayer spent six seasons in the minor leagues, and he split the 1952 season between San Jose of the California League and Yuma of the Southwest International League, winning one game for each team. The Red Sox kept him at San Jose in 1953, and Mayer produced a 17‚Äì8 record. In 1954 he won 17 games for Greensboro of the Class B Carolina League, and in 1955 he went 11‚Äì7 for Montgomery of the Class A Sally League. Drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals after the season, Mayer split the 1956 season between Omaha of the American Association, where he was 6‚Äì5, and Rochester of the International League, where he won one game in five decisions. After two games at Omaha in 1957, Mayer spent the rest of the season at Double-A Fort Worth of the Texas League, where he started 26 times, pitched nine complete games, posted three shutouts, and finished with an 8‚Äì13 record with a 4.04 ERA. Mayer was called up by the Cubs, and he made his major league debut at Wrigley Field against the New York Giants on September 15, 1957. Ed pitched five innings, leaving with the score 5‚Äì3 in favor of the Giants after Hank Sauer belted a three-run homer in the fifth. Mayer got no decision. Instead, the Cubs scored four more runs, Don Elston racked up the 7‚Äì6 win in relief, and Turk Lown got a save. Mayer appeared in relief in two more games that September, going 0‚Äì0 with a 5.87 ERA. In 1958 Mayer pitched in relief in 19 games for the Cubs, and he was 2‚Äì2 with a 3.80 ERA. Relying on his sinking fastball, he pitched 23.2 innings, allowed 15 hits and 12 runs, 10 of them earned. On June 5, 1958, in his final big league appearance against the Philadelphia Phillies, he faced two batters, hitting the first and yielding a three-run double in what became a 7‚Äì6 loss. Mayer's arm was sore, he lost some of the zip on his fastball, and he was sent to Omaha, where he posted no record. Overall, Mayer went 2‚Äì2 with a 4.31 ERA in 22 big league games. He pitched at Portland of the Pacific Coast League in 1958, posting a 2‚Äì6 mark in 21 games, and in 1959 he was 0‚Äì4 at Denver of the American Association in 10 games. Mayer fashioned a 64‚Äì59 record in 202 games in his eight-year minor league career. In both 1953 and 1954, he produced records of 17‚Äì8. Mayer died of cancer in Corte Madera, California on December 29, 2015.

Hall is a historic building located just north of downtown Davenport, Iowa, United States. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. History The building dates from 1859 when Hermann A. Wupperman built it to house his grocery store. He was in partnership with William P. Hall and their business was named Wupperman and Hall. with The third floor was known as \\"Union Hall\\" before it was leased to Davenport Lodge No. 7 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (I.O.O.F.), who occupied the building for over one hundred years. During the Great Depression the Odd Fellows shared their space with other fraternal organizations. The storefronts on the first floor have been occupied by various businesses over the years. Architecture The Wupperman Block/I.O.O.F. Hall is the first building on the left in this 1880 photograph. The Wupperman Block is a three-story, brick building that was built on a stone foundation. It is an early attempt at Renaissance Revival architecture in Davenport, which up until this time was dominated by the Greek Revival style. The structure is rectangular in shape and has a side-gable roof. The two storefronts on the first floor are largely intact. The main fa√ßade of the building is divided into three sections: the storefront, the upper wall and the cornice. Although the building has been renovated it maintains its cast iron shop fronts and flanking brick piers. The upper floors of the building contain seven windows that are evenly distributed. The windows are all rectangular in shape, but each is topped with a curved cornice. The windows on the third floor are taller than the ones on the second, which gives the building a vertical orientation. At one time the windows on the third floor were stained glass and depicted symbols of the I.O.O.F. These windows have been removed. When it was built, the building had a projecting cornice that has been replaced by a cornice of corbelled brick. The side-gabled roofline is unusual for a building in Iowa and suggests a European influence in its design. The building remains a good example of pre-Civil War commercial architecture.

The Serpis river crosses the municipal boundary of Alcoi. The local authority reported a population of 61,135 residents in 2018. History The first traces of human presence in the area date to c. 60,000 years ago, when Neanderthal hunters settled here, in a site now called El Salt.Los neandertales completaban con vegetales su dieta carn√≠vora A site with rock paintings, dating to c. 10,000/6,500 years ago, has been discovered near la Sarga. From around the mid-3rd millennium BC people started to move from the caves to the plain where cereals were grown, while mountain fortifications were erected (Mola Alta de Serelles, Mas del Corral, Mas de Menente, El Puig). After the Roman conquest of the Iberians, several rural villas were built in the area, as well as a necropolis. The town was established in 1256 by James I of Aragon, with the construction of a castle on a strategic position over the Serpis river, to secure the southern frontier of the Kingdom of Valencia during the Reconquista. In 1291 the town was donated by King James II of Aragon to the Sicilian admiral Roger of Lauria; it will not return a royal possession until 1430. During the War of Spanish Succession, Alcoi sided for the cause of archduke Charles, and was therefore besieged and stripped of numerous privileges, which started a period of decline. In 1873 the workers of Alcoy revolted in the Petroleum Revolution.

It was developed by the National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark, Department of Atmospheric Environment, Aarhus University. As a result of reorganisation at Aarhus University the model has been maintained by the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University since 2011. For about 20 years, OSPM has been used in many countries for studying traffic pollution, performing analyses of field campaign measurements, studying efficiency of pollution abatement strategies, carrying out exposure assessments and as reference in comparisons to other models. OSPM is generally considered as state-of-the-art in practical street pollution modelling. Description Figure 1: Principal flow pattern inside a street canyon for near perpendicular roof level wind direction and schematic picture of the main processes assumed in OSPM. In OSPM concentrations of traffic-emitted pollution is calculated using a combination of a plume model for the direct contribution and a box model for the recirculating part of the pollutants in the street. The NO2 concentrations are calculated taking into account NO-NO2-O3 chemistry and the residence time of pollutants in the street. The model is designed to work with input and output in the form of one-hour averages. The main principles in the model are depicted in Figure 1 for the case of a wind direction nearly perpendicular to the street canyon. A receptor point in leeward position is affected by the direct plume showing considerably higher concentrations than a receptor in windward position being exposed to the less concentrated recirculating air. The turbulence produced by the moving traffic (TPT) is acting in addition to the turbulence created by the roof level wind. This leads to a faster dispersion of the direct plume but also to an improved air exchange at roof level between the street canyon and the background air.

Biography Eleanor Gates was born on 26 September 1874 in Shakopee, Minnesota, southwest of Minneapolis. She later described her early life in her novel The Biography of a Prairie Girl. Gates married another playwright, Richard Walton Tully, in 1901 after they had both completed their studies at the University of California, in Berkeley. Gates had worked initially as a writer for a newspaper in San Francisco, as well as writing novels. In 1907, one of her novels was illustrated by Arthur Rackham. Her best known work was the play The Poor Little Rich Girl, which was produced by her husband in 1913. Tully divorced her in 1914 citing desertion, which Gates admitted. Before Gates's divorce had been finalized, she married another divorc√©, Frederick Ferdinand Moore, in Paterson, New Jersey, in October 1914. In 1916 they separated when they both realized that they were not legally married. At the time they both said they intended to remarry when it could be arranged. Moore later created Book Dealers' Weekly (1925). At the beginning of 1915, Gates founded the Liberty Feature Film Company, which was said by Motion Picture News to be the only film company to be owned and managed by women. The company was led by the wife of an Alaskan businessman, Sadir Lindblom. In the year that it existed the company created several two reel films. The first film, produced in 1917, was The Poor Little Rich Girl, which starred Mary Pickford. Shirley Temple starred in the 1936 remake of the same name. The film story, created to cash in on the talents of the eight-year-old Temple and the rights to the \\"changing places\\" story, was obtained for $40,000 to Gates and an additional $20,000 to Mary Pickford's company which had made the 1917 film. The new film had made two million dollars by the end of 1939. Gates died on 7 March 1951 in Los Angeles County General Hospital.

It was inaugurated on First Advent Sunday 1894.  History  The church was destroyed in 1770 by the Russian Army and again following the Ume√• city fire of 1888 which destroyed most of the town. The existing new-gothic church was designed by the city architect Fredrik Olaus Lindstr√∂m and built in brick with a stone foundation. The church was constructed between 1892 and 1894, and it is the third of a series of churches on the same site. Three restorations with additions to the building have partially changed the church's original appearance. The aisle in Ume√• City Church  First restoration  In 1929, the church council decided to conduct a major restoration of the church. A leaky roof that had damaged the mural on the ceiling as well as other deteriorations lead to the necessity of a major restoration; before this time, only minor repairs had been carried out. There was also a desire to obliterate the 1890s architectural image of the church portraying \\"the most difficult period of decadence architecture to date\\". Castle Architect Knut Nordenskj√∂ld was commissioned to inspect the church and make suggestions for restoration, which he completed in 1930. His suggestions led to many discussions, especially the issue of adding an aisle among the pews. On December 27, 1935, the church council finally decided to implement castle architect's proposal. On January 17, work began on the church. The organ gallery and the choir were expanded; ventilation ducts were relocated; inner doors were added at the main entrance; part of the floor was replaced with limestone slabs, and the interior was repainted to a soft white. The church was rededicated on the first Sunday in Advent in 1937, with the presiding bishop of the Diocese of Lule√•, Olof Bergqvist, participating in the service.  Bridge Construction  In 1971, it was decided that √ñstra Kyrkogatan would be extended over the Ume River, adding a third bridge to the city, Kyrkbron. At the commencement of construction, a grave field next to the church was discovered. In accordance to the Antiquities Act (Swedish: Fornminneslagen), construction was halted the summer of 1972, until the area had been investigated by archaeologists. The original boundaries of the cemetery were unknown and there was no registry or map. The excavation unearthed forty coffin graves with approximately sixty skeletons. In the last grave a legible name plate revealed that it was a family grave for the governor Pehr Adam Stromberg. No tombstones were found. It is believed that a tombstone was destroyed in the fire of 1888, and all documentation of the family grave was destroyed in the fire as well. After the remains were examined, they were returned to the church in plastic bags. The church janitor buried plastic bags without documenting the exact site, and a short time later, he died.

Background O'Molloy was native of what is now north County Tipperary. He became a Cistercian monk at Baltinglass, and eventually rose to be abbot of that house. His family, the O'Molloy, claimed descent from the branch of the Connachta later to be known as the southern U√≠ N√©ill. Albin's ancestor, Fiachu mac N√©ill (flourished 507‚Äì514), was one of the Kings of Uisnech; his descendants, the Cen√©l Fiachach, held lands from Birr to Uisnech in southern Westmeath and part of Offaly. Their southern territory became known as Fir Cell (land of the churches) covering a large part of what is now County Offaly, where the surname O'Molloy is still very common. Sermon in Dublin In Lent 1186, when John Comyn, archbishop of Dublin, held a synod at Holy Trinity Church, O'Molloy preached a long sermon on clerical continency, in which he laid all the blame for existing evils on the Welsh and English clergy who had come over to Ireland. Bishop of Ferns O'Molloy was shortly afterwards made bishop of Ferns, the see having been previously declined by Gerald of Wales. He was present at the coronation of Richard I on 3 September 1189. On 5 November, he was appointed by Pope Innocent III, with the Archbishop of Tuam and Bishop of Kilmacduagh, to excommunicate the Bishop of Waterford, who had robbed the Bishop of Lismore. In 1205, O'Molloy received 10 shillings from the royal gift, and on 3 April 1206 was recommended by the king to the chapter of Cashel for archbishop.Calendar of Documents relating to Ireland, i. 258, 291. In November 1207, Innocent addressed a letter to O'Molloy with reference to persons who had been improperly ordained. On 17 June 1208, O'Molloy was sent by the king on a mission to the King of Connaught. On 15 September 1215, he had protection while attending the council at Rome; and on 5 September 1216 received custody of the bishopric of Killaloe.ib. i. 385, 658,721 Excommunication of Earl of Pembroke William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, while in Ireland between 1207 and 1213, seized two manors belonging to the Bishop of Ferns. For this O'Molloy excommunicated him; but the earl pleaded that it was done in time of war, and retained the manors all his life. After Marshal's death, O'Molloy came to the king at London and petitioned for the restoration of his lands. King Henry III begged the bishop to absolve the dead, but O'Molloy refused to do so unless restoration were made. To this the younger William Marshal and his brothers refused their consent, and O'Molloy then cursed them, and foretold the end of their race.Matt. Paris, iv. 492 The quarrel appears to have been at a crisis in 1218. On 18 April of that year, O'Molloy was prohibited from prosecuting his plea against William, earl Marshal, and on 25 June Pope Honorius III directed the Archbishop of Dublin and the legate to effect a reconciliation between the bishop and the earl.Calendar of Documents relating to Ireland, i. 823; Cal. Papal Registers, i. 56 Nevertheless, the male line of the Marshall family ended with the death of Anselm Marshal, 6th Earl of Pembroke (2nd Creation) in 1245. Like all his brothers, he had no children, and the estate was divided up among female heirs. Life of Abban About 1218, O'Molloy wrote a life of Abb√°n of Mag Arnaide (Adamstown), who died about 520. His interest in the saint partly stemmed from the fact that Mag Arnaide lay within the diocese of Ferns, but also denoted his personal attachment to the saint's cult in an episode where Abb√°n converts a man of royal rank from the area and baptises his son: \\"I who gathered together and wrote the Life am a descendant [nepos] of that son\\". However, the immediate circumstances which prompted the composition of the Life are likely to have been political, a direct consequence of his quarrel with the Marshall family. Death O'Molloy died on 1 January 1223.Annals of Loch C√©, i. 267 Matthew Paris speaks of him as conspicuous for his sanctity. O'Molloy consecrated the infirmary chapel at the Cistercian abbey of Waverley on 6 November 1201, and dedicated five altars there on 10 July 1214. The monks of St. Swithin's, Winchester, made him a member of their fraternity. He appears as a witness to several charters in the Chartulary of St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin.

The highest Hardy is Ben Nevis in Scotland at 1,344 metres, the United Kingdom's highest point, and the lowest location identified is on Hayling Island in Hampshire at only 10 metres. The 5 recent additional Hardys are Portsea Island (343), Foulness (344), Canvey Island (345), Thorney Island (346) and Potton Island (347), all in the South-east of England. Many Hardys feature in other major hill lists (for example, there are 10 Munros, 23 Hewitts and 127 Marilyns) but the Hardy list is unique in identifying high points in the three separate categories of hill ranges, islands and administrative areas. This means there are Hardys all over the United Kingdom, not just in mountain and hill areas, so many Hardys are in lowland and even urban areas, and on small islands. Thus at least one or more Hardys are accessible wherever a person lives in the United Kingdom, and irrespective of their level of fitness.

The subclavian vein is a big vessel that drains the blood from the hand, forearm and the upper arm into the right side of the heart through superior vena cava. The subclavian veins lie just behind the clavicle on each side and therefore known as subclavian vein. Indications: Catheter placement in one of the big veins (Subclavian vein, Internal jugular vein or femoral vein) is routinely done to monitor central venous pressure (CVP), to administer long term intravenous medication and parenteral nutrition in critically sick patients. The subclavian vein is the preferred choice for this purpose because it is most comfortable to the patient and has less chances of infection. However, there is a significant risk of misplacement of subclavian vein catheter into the internal jugular vein of same side. Misplaced catheter enhances the risk of clot formation, thrombophlebitis, catheter erosion and inappropriate delivery of drugs in addition to erroneous CVP value. Chest skiagram is performed to identify misplacement, however, it is time consuming, requires exposure to radiation and may not be feasible in emergency situations. Maneuver:Ambesh maneuver not only prevents misplacement of subclavian vein catheter into the IJV but also provides instant diagnosis of misplaced catheter. Following successful puncture of subclavian vein with a cannula/needle, same side of IJV is compressed externally by placing a sterile finger in supraclavicular fossa. The guidewire is threaded through the cannula into the subclavian vein keeping the compression on. If the operator notices resistance while inserting the guidewire, it means the guidewire is going north into the IJV. The guidewire is removed gently and re-threaded maintaining the pressure in the supraclavicular fossa. After successful insertion of the guidewire, pressure in fossa is released and the subclavian vein catheter is railroaded over the guidewire up to the desired length. The guidewire is removed and the catheter is now connected to the transducer and the monitor. The CVP waveform pattern as well as its value is noted. The ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa is compressed again and any change in CVP value and/or its waveform pattern is noted. If the waveform pattern is lost (becomes straight line) and or CVP value increased by more than 2 cm H2O then it is surely a misplaced subclavian vein catheter into the same side IJV. If no change occurs then this catheter is fine and can be used for CVP monitoring and drug administration. The Ambesh maneuver is quite simple, handy, inexpensive, and instant bedside technique that prevents and diagnoses misplacement of subclavian vein catheter into the IJV The maneuver is now routinely used and recommended by others to avoid the most common misplacement of subclavian vein catheter.Lin M.

Davis represented the 10th district in the Texas Senate from 2009 to 2015. She was previously on the Fort Worth City Council. She is now a public speaker and political commentator, as well as the founder of Deeds Not Words, a non-profit for engaging young women in politics. On June 25, 2013, Davis held a thirteen- hour-long filibuster to block Senate Bill 5, a measure which included more restrictive abortion regulations for Texas.. The filibuster played a major role in Senate Democrats' success in delaying passage of the bill beyond the midnight deadline for the end of the legislative session, though it ultimately passed in a second session. The filibuster brought Davis national attention, leading to speculation about a run for governor of Texas. She subsequently ran for governor of Texas in 2014, but was defeated by Republican Party nominee Greg Abbott by 59% to 38%. On July 22, 2019, Davis announced she will run for Texas's 21st congressional district in 2020.https://twitter.com/wendydavis/status/1153280783383191552 Early life, education, and family Wendy Davis was born Wendy Jean Russell in West Warwick, Rhode Island, the daughter of Virginia \\"Ginger\\" (n√©e Stovall) and Jerry Russell. Her family moved to Fort Worth, Texas in 1973, when she was 10 years old. At the time, Jerry worked at National Cash Register. When Russell was 13, her parents divorced. Her father quit his job to pursue work in community theater, leading his child support payments to dry up. Her mother, who had a ninth grade education, supported her four children by working menial jobs, including one at a Braum's ice cream shop. At 14 years of age, Russell was selling newspaper subscriptions for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram and working at an Orange Julius stand. When she was 17 and still in high school, she moved in with her boyfriend, construction worker Frank Underwood. In 1981, she graduated from Richland High School as a member of the National Honor Society. She married Underwood on January 24, 1982, and gave birth to her first daughter, Amber, later that year. When she was 19, she and Underwood separated, and she continued to live in their mobile home with Amber. After several months, she moved in with her mother, and then eventually began living in her own apartment. She filed for divorce from Underwood in December 1983, and it became official on May 22, 1984, when she was 21. She was given custody of Amber, with Underwood paying child support. She attended University of Texas at Arlington for one semester, but Davis left the school for financial reasons. Meanwhile, her father had opened the European Sandwich Shop and Stage Door Deli in downtown Fort Worth, with his Stage West Theatre next door. While waiting tables at Stage West in 1983, she was introduced by her father to lawyer and former city councilman Jeffry R. Davis, who would become her second husband. The couple eventually married on May 30, 1987 after dating for \\"two or three years,\\" and they settled in a historic home in the Mistletoe Heights neighborhood of Fort Worth. Around 1983, she also worked as a receptionist at a doctor's office, where a nurse gave her a brochure for Tarrant County College. She enrolled in their two-year paralegal program, attending from 1984 to 1986. She began dating Jeff Davis during this time. After Tarrant College, she enrolled at Texas Christian University (TCU) in 1986 on an academic scholarship and a Pell Grant. After Davis' second marriage, her husband began to make significant financial contributions to her education. He would ultimately adopt her daughter, Amber. A second daughter, Dru, was born in September 1988. Davis underwent abortions for two later pregnancies, one due to an ectopic tubal pregnancy (whom she named \\"Lucas\\") and another due to the fetus suffering from Dandy‚ÄìWalker syndrome (whom she named \\"Tate Elise\\"). In May 1990, Davis graduated from TCU with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. That fall, she moved with her daughters to Lexington, Massachusetts, to attend Harvard Law School. This living situation proved untenable, and after four months her daughters returned to Texas to live with Jeff. Her mother helped to care for them, and Davis flew back regularly to visit her family for the remainder of her time at Harvard. While at Harvard, she volunteered at a legal clinic for the poor, where she helped AIDS patients write living wills and surviving partners with their legal rights. In May 1993, she earned her J.D. degree cum laude, and she was admitted to the State Bar of Texas in November 1993.Record, State Bar of Texas, Wendy Davis, at . In November 2003, Jeff and Wendy Davis separated. When the divorce settlement was finalized in 2005, the former couple shared \\"joint conservatorship\\" over Dru, who primarily lived with her father in the family home. In the divorce settlement, Jeff was given the \\"right to designate the primary residence\\" of Dru, and Wendy agreed to pay $1,200 a month in child support. Both parents retained the right to decisions about Dru's other needs; Amber was a young adult in college at that time. Law career After graduating from law school, Davis was law clerk to U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer of the Northern District of Texas in Dallas from 1993 to 1994.Gardner, Jacylyn.

In 1999, her husband, Jeff Davis started Safeco Title Co. of Fort Worth, Texas and she became part owner. The title company was sold to First American Title as part of their divorce decree. She continued to work at the Fort Worth branch of First American Title until 2009. Davis joined Cantey Hanger in an of counsel role in March 2010. Davis' of counsel relationship with Cantey Hanger ended on December 31, 2013. She partnered with Brian Newby to open Newby Davis, PLLC in March 2010. Her current practice includes federal and local governmental affairs, litigation, economic development, contract compliance and real estate matters. During her time working for the title company Safeco, Davis was paid an annual salary of $40,000 by her husband Jeff Davis, who told Robert Draper of the New York Times Magazine that he paid her the salary for her work for the city of Fort Worth as a council member, a job that paid little. Political career=City Council Davis first ran for the Fort Worth City Council in 1996, but was defeated by ninety votes. After her defeat, Davis sued the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, American Broadcasting Company, and the Disney Company, which at the time owned the Star-Telegram and ABC. The Texas Tribune stated that she alleged \\"that biased coverage led to her defeat and caused injury to her physical and mental health\\". Her claims were rejected by the Texas courts, based upon the Star-Telegram's First Amendment free speech grounds.\\"Metro & Texas Digest\\", Fort Worth Star-Telegram, November 3, 2000 Subsequently, in 1999, Davis was elected to the Fort Worth City Council. During her nine-year tenure there, Davis focused on transportation, economic development, and neighborhood issues. She also worked on economic development projects, such as the Montgomery Plaza renovation, the Tower, Pier One and Radio Shack campuses. = Republican politics = While serving on the Fort Worth City Council, Davis voted in Republican primaries. Davis has said that she was then a Republican because she liked Republican Congresswoman Kay Granger of Fort Worth, and she wanted to vote on judicial nominees in Republican primaries. She voted in the Republican primaries in 1996, 1998 and 2006 and she has given $1,500 to Granger.Root, Jay. Spotlight on Davis, the Democrats' Big Hope, The Texas Tribune, September 1, 2013. Also, in April 1999, she gave $250 to George W. Bush's first presidential campaign. State Senate As a Texas State Senator Davis represented the Texas's 10th Senate district, which includes portions of Tarrant County, Texas. In 2008, she narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Senator Kim Brimer for the seat, despite a legal challenge against her candidacy by the state Republican Party. Davis was re-elected in 2012, defeating a challenge from Mark M. Shelton, a Fort Worth pediatrician and Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, who was seeking the 10th district seat again in 2014. Davis was the Vice-Chair on the Senate Select Committee on Open Government. She was also a Member of the Senate Committee on Economic Development, the Senate Committee on Transportation, and the Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee. She had previously served on the Senate Committee for Education and as Vice-Chair on the Senate Committee on International Relations and Trade. On May 29, 2011, Davis launched a filibuster of a budget bill that cut $4 billion from public education in the state, resulting in a special session called by Texas Gov. Rick Perry. In 2009, Texas Monthly named her \\"Rookie of the Year\\". She was also chosen by the readers of Fort Worth Weekly as the \\"Best Servant of the People\\". In January 2012, Davis was listed among \\"12 State Legislators to Watch in 2012\\" by Governing magazine and was mentioned as a possible candidate for statewide races. Early in the 83rd Session, senators drew for terms in a post-redistricting, once-a-decade process. Davis drew a two-year term and was up for re-election in November 2014. In March 2013, she announced her intention to run for re-election to the Senate. On October 3, 2013, she changed her mind and announced a candidacy for governor of Texas instead of re-election to the State Senate. =2013 filibuster= On June 25, 2013, Davis performed a filibuster to block Senate Bill 5, a proposal to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, require abortion clinics to meet the same standards that hospital-style surgical centers do, and mandate that a doctor who performs abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. She attempted to hold the floor until midnight, when the Senate's special session ended, after which it would no longer be able to vote on the measure. Following an 11-hour filibuster‚Äîending three hours short of midnight‚ÄîLieutenant Governor David Dewhurst ruled that Davis had gone off topic, forcing a vote on whether the filibuster could continue. Despite Republican efforts, parliamentary inquiries from Leticia R. Van de Putte and others as well as raucous cheering and yelling from the political activists gathered in the Capitol carried on through midnight and the close of the special session. Following the deadline, Republicans indicated that a vote had taken place and passed, while Democrats declared that the vote had taken place after midnight, making it void. Dewhurst later conceded that the bill was dead. The next day, Governor Rick Perry called for a second special session to allow for another attempt to pass the abortion restrictions, as well as to address other issues. The bill was eventually passed by both the House and the Senate in the July 2013 second special session,Schwartz, John.

The filibuster attracted national attention, including from The New York Times and The Washington Post. National fundraising by and speculation about a gubernatorial run for Davis also followed.\\"Battleground Texas surpasses $1M\\", Politico, July 15, 2013. Retrieved July 29, 2013. She was encouraged to run by groups like Battleground Texas and EMILY's List. Campaign for Governor of Texas On October 3, 2013, Davis announced her intention to run for Governor of Texas in the 2014 gubernatorial election. On March 4, 2014, she won the Democratic nomination with 432,065 votes (79.1 percent), defeating her only challenger, Reynaldo \\"Ray\\" Madrigal, who received 114,458 votes (20.9 percent). Davis was the first female nominee for Texas governor since the defeat of Gov. Ann Richards in 1994 by George W. Bush. In the election on November 4, 2014 she lost to Republican nominee Greg Abbott, the then-outgoing Texas Attorney General. In January 2014, Wayne Slater, of The Dallas Morning News, reported that while the basic story in which Davis defined herself politically was true, the full story was \\"more complicated\\" and the short version Davis had been telling on the campaign trail \\"blurred\\" some facts. In particular, Slater said Davis did not divorce until she was 21, not 19 as she had claimed, that she only lived in her family's mobile home for a few months after the divorce, and that she had been financially supported by Jeff Davis while at TCU and Harvard. Davis acknowledged the errors and said, \\"My language should be tighter. I'm learning about using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail.\\" Amid the controversy, Davis' daughters each released letters in defense of their mother. Dru, Davis' younger daughter wrote, \\"I have been reading and hearing so many untrue things about my mom and I wanted to set the record straight.\\"Henderson, Nia-Malika. Wendy Davis‚Äôs daughters defend her in letters, The Washington Post, January 28, 2014. In August 2014, Davis released her first campaign ad, entitled \\"A Texas Story.\\" The ad attacked her rival, Abbott, for a Texas Supreme Court decision where he dissented. Diane Reese in The Washington Post called the advertisement \\"character assassination and fear-mongering\\". In October 2014, a Davis campaign ad was described by Aaron Blake of The Washington Post as \\"one of the nastiest campaign ads you will ever see.\\" It attacks Abbott as being hypocritical for receiving monies from an accident which incapacitated him, and then, as attorney general, supporting litigation limits on such payments. Mother Jones called the ad \\"offensive and nasty\\". MSNBC stated that the advertisement is probably \\"a hail mary effort\\" because Davis is trailing Abbott by double digits in the polls. In November 2014, Salon journalist Jenny Kutner reported that American Thinker writer Deborah C. Tyler came up with a last-minute nickname for then-gubernatorial candidate Davis, a \\"gynecist\\", a term Kutner felt was meant to be derogatory by Tyler, but according to Kutner, \\"actually sounds kind of awesome once she starts describing what it means: Gynecism promotes the political position that the primary and most essential power a female can hold is the control of her own sexual and genital functions.\\"Salon On November 4, 2014, Davis lost the race to become governor by a 20 percent margin. According to exit polls she only received 47% of the women voters in Texas. Campaign for Congress On July 22, 2019, Davis announced her candidacy for the United States House of Representatives to represent Texas's 21st congressional district against incumbent Chip Roy. Political positions Upon examining Davis' voting record over her three terms in the Texas Senate, Mark P. Jones, the Chairman of the Department of Political Science at Rice University in Houston, concluded that Davis was the fourth most liberal senator out of the 31 state senators who served during at least two of the three terms during which Davis had served. Jones found that she was \\"significantly more liberal\\" than John Whitmire, Juan Hinojosa, Carlos Uresti, and Eddie Lucio Jr., who represent the centrist wing of the Texas Senate Democrats, \\"significantly more conservative\\" than Jos√© R. Rodr√≠guez, the most liberal Texas Senate Democrat, and \\"statistically indistinguishable\\" from the other six Texas Senate Democrats. Abortion In 2009 and 2011, Davis voted against a bill that requires physicians to perform a sonogram on and provide other information to abortion patients prior to an abortion. In 2011, she would also vote against a bill that requires an ultrasound prior to an abortion. On June 25, 2013, she held an eleven hour long filibuster to block Senate Bill 5, a measure which included more restrictive abortion regulations for Texas. The filibuster played a major role in Senate Democrats' efforts to delay passage of the bill beyond the midnight deadline for the end of the legislative session, though it ultimately passed in a second session. On August 5, 2013, when asked about what legal limits on abortion she would support, she replied, \\"You know, the Supreme Court has made that decision. And it's one of the protected liberties under our Constitution. And I respect the constitutional protections that are in place today.\\" In October 2013, campaign spokesman Bo Delp told Politifact by email it's incorrect to say Davis opposes any limits. \\"Like most Texans, Sen. Davis opposes late-term abortions except when the life or health of the mother is endangered, in cases of rape or incest or in the case of severe and irreversible fetal abnormalities,\\" Delp said. Also in October 2013, EMILY's List endorsed Wendy Davis for governor in 2014. On February 11, 2014, Davis said that she would have supported a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, if the law adequately deferred to a woman and her doctor. She said she found the ban on abortions after 20 weeks to be the \\"least objectionable\\" provision in the abortion bill she filibustered last year. Gun rights While on the Fort Worth City Council, Davis supported gun restrictions, including for gun shows at city facilities. In 2011, she voted against a bill that authorizes concealed handgun permit holders to carry concealed handguns while on the campus of an institution of higher education. In 2013, she voted for a bill establishing certain tax exemptions for firearms manufacturers, along with a bill that authorizes certain university students to transport a licensed handgun or ammunition in a locked motor vehicle on a college or university campus. On February 6, 2014, she expressed support for a proposed open carry gun law in Texas, which was banned under Texas state law. The state senator from Fort Worth said such a law should allow private property owners to determine whether weapons could be openly carried on their property. She also said background checks and training requirements would \\"help ensure that only mentally stable, law-abiding citizens may carry, whether concealed or open.\\" She later said that she believes municipalities should be able to decide whether the proposed open carry and existing concealed carry laws should be used in their limits. After losing the election, she said that she opposes open carry, and that \\"I made a quick decision on that with a very short conversation with my team and it wasn't really in keeping with what I think is the correct position on that issue\\". LGBT rights In 2000, Davis voted for Fort Worth's nondiscrimination ordinance based on sexual orientation. In 2011, she authored the only LGBT-inclusive version of anti- bullying legislation and co-sponsored youth suicide prevention legislation and lobbied to kill an anti-transgender marriage bill. In 2013, she co-authored the Senate version of a statewide workplace nondiscrimination bill, co- authored inclusive insurance nondiscrimination legislation, and she was one of only two senators to voted against an anti-trans marriage bill. In January 2014, Human Rights Campaign endorsed Wendy Davis for governor in 2014. On February 13, 2014, she expressed support for same-sex marriage and said that Attorney General Greg Abbott, her presumed general-election opponent in the race for governor, should stop defending the state's ban on same-sex marriage. Cannabis On February 11, 2014, Davis expressed support for decriminalizing cannabis. She said she would back legislation to decrease criminal provisions for possession of small amounts of cannabis and believes medical cannabis should be left to the voters. Electoral history Davis lost her first race for Fort Worth City Council in 1996, but after her election in 1999 she served a nine-year tenure in the Fort Worth City Council. Davis ran unopposed in the 2001 and 2005 general elections. Her Texas State Senate career began in 2008, when she unseated by a margin of two percentage points the Republican incumbent, Kim Brimer. She was reelected in 2012. City council elections1999=2003=2007State senate elections2008=20122014 gubernatorial election=Published works * ReferencesFurther reading * External links  * State Sen.

History Until the 19th century, hangings were carried out on Westmount ( (gallows hill); J√®rriais: Mont √®s Pendus (hill of the hanged men)) in Saint Helier. The last such execution was carried out on 3 October 1829, when Philippe Jolin was hanged for murder. The following execution, that of Fran√ßois Bradley on 11 October 1866, was carried out in public outside the prison in Saint Helier. The law specified hanging in public until 1907. The next execution, therefore, that of Joseph Philip Le Brun on 12 August 1875, also took place under the same conditions. It was the last public hanging in the British Isles (the United Kingdom had abolished public hangings in 1868). The death sentence passed on Thomas Connan (executed 19 February 1907) necessitated a law change to permit the hanging to take place within the prison walls. During the German Occupation 1940-1945, the occupying forces carried out executions by firing squad. The last execution in Jersey was on 9 October 1959, when Francis Joseph Huchet was hanged for murder. In Jersey, the last death sentence was passed in 1984, but was commuted to life imprisonment. Abolition Capital punishment was abolished by the Homicide (Jersey) Law 1986 in relation to the offence of murder and by the Genocide (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 1987 in relation to the offence of genocide. Technically, the death penalty remained available to a military court, but by the 1986 and 1987 laws the Royal Court of Jersey lost the power of capital sentencing. References to capital punishment in obsolete laws were formally removed by the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) (Jersey) Law 2007. The Human Rights (Amendment) (Jersey) Order 2006 amends the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000 to give effect to the 13th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights providing for the total abolition of the death penalty.

The film was shot on location in South London and Brighton, and played in cinemas as the support feature to Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. Unseen for decades, this is currently considered a lost film, and is on the British Film Institute's \\"75 Most Wanted\\" list of missing British feature films. Plot Bored South London teenager Phil (Rothwell) joins a gang led by the Chief (Cavan Malone) and begins to be drawn into a world of petty crime and violence. When he meets Linda (White), his interest begins to shift away from the gang and towards her. She tries to pull him away from the gang's bad influence. The couple go on a day trip to Brighton. On the way home Phil makes a pass at Linda, but is rebuffed as she tells him she is not that kind of girl. Later, the local coffee bar which acts as the gang's territory is threatened by incomers. The Chief musters his minions, and Phil agrees to join in after being duped into thinking that Linda is playing fast and loose with another boy. After the ruck, Phil finds out that he has been tricked by the Chief. Urged by the progressively-minded local vicar, he decides to leave the gang behind. Other members also see the light and join him, leaving the Chief on his own. Phil and Linda discuss the possibility of marriage.

The Cinema Exhibitors' Association commented favourably: \\"This is an unpretentious but amusing little film which combines action with humour and even some charm.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin was less enthusiastic, saying: \\"The author of this story would seem to be afraid of his subject. He steers a middle course which is neither one thing nor the other. Carol White does her best to look the part of a young tart-type, and Alan Rothwell is dressed for the part, but neither make much of an impression.\\" The film is considered of potential interest to cinema historians, both as an early directorial outing by Sharp and as a period piece capturing a very specific moment in British social history, with the additional nostalgia appeal of location shots of 1960 Brighton and Battersea Fun Fair.

He played club level rugby union (RU) for Cardiff RFC as a three-quarter or half-back, and club level rugby league (RL) for Hull FC Background Driscoll was born in Cardiff, Wales, his wife Louisa was proprietor of a dining and tearooms in Cardiff , his father Patrick Driscoll was born in Skibbereen, County Cork, Ireland. Rugby union career Driscoll joined Cardiff RFC during the 1895‚Äì96 season, playing as a half-back. He gained a place in the first team during his initial season and scored 9 tries. Driscoll was not as prolific the following season, with just five tries to his name; but during the 1897‚Äì98 season he was switched to the wing. This saw Driscoll becoming the club's fourth highest try scorer with a tally of 16, playing in 30 of the 31 first team games. Cardiff Rugby Club historian D. E. Davies described Driscoll that season as, \\"our excellent uncapped wing\\". Having been overlooked by the Wales (RU), the next season Driscoll switched codes to professional rugby league with Hull FC, alongside former Cardiff half-back Tom Savage. Nickname Hockey Driscoll's nickname of \\"Hockey\\" was a corruption of Hawkeye, and pronounced Ockey, as he would prefer to ankle tap tackle, rather than body tackle, which demanded both a quick-eye (Hawkeye), and fast reactions to see and catch the opposition player's foot.

This castle served to protect the island of Tenerife from pirate attacks.  History  In the 16th century, the King Philip II sent the Italian military engineer Leonardo Torriani to fortify the coast of Santa Cruz de Tenerife,Puertos pondr√° carteles donde estaban las fortificaciones among the most important places to protect was the Valle de Salazar (Salazar Valley) which is now the town of San Andr√©s. Most researchers agree that the castle was built in 1706, although there are writings that mention it in 1697. Since the 17th century, it was considered necessary to defend the beach of San Andr√©s and to protect ships from pirate attacks. During the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1797, the castle played a very important role as shots from the castle destroyed the mast and riggings of the Theseus, the ship of Admiral Horacio Nelson. The castle was built adjacent to the mouth of the stream of the ravine of the Cercado de Andr√©s, just downstream of where it is joined by the stream of the ravine of the orchards. During a heavy rain this stream flooded, and collapsed part of the castle, but the other half is still standing. On November 28, 1967, it was declared a Spanish Historical Heritage, the April 22, 1949 \\"Patrimonio Hist√≥rico Espa√±ol\\" and in 1999 was declared of Cultural Interest in the Canary Islands.

This final volume was prepared for publication by Benedykt Wiszowaty (the great-grandson of Faustus Socinius), who added eight brief essays on the history of Polish Socinianism. Circulation The Eton College library had a collection of the original Racovian books printed by Sternacki about 1630, possibly donated by John Hales, but these had disappeared by 1674. John Locke possessed a full set of Vols I-XVIII and was personally involved in commissioning Vol IX. Pierre Bayle appears to have had access to a full set. Related publications Outside the series of the Bibliotheca fratrum Polonorum, various other Racovian and Socinian texts were printed or reprinted in Amsterdam by the same group of exiles, printers and booksellers. The Racovian Catechism and Racovian New Testament which had been published in the Racovian Academy itself, were also reprinted in Amsterdam. Following completion of the above series Benedykt Wiszowaty was also involved in the other major, but much shorter, Socinian Bibliotheca: The Bibliotheca antitrinitariorum, or Antitrinitarian Library, first published in 1684. This is a posthumous work of Christopher Sandius an exiled Prussian Arian in Amsterdam, in which he chronologically lists all the Arian and Socinian or Antitrinitarian authors from the Reformation to 1684, with a brief account of their lives, and a catalogue of their works. Rather than being a Library, as was Kuyper's publications, it is more a Bibliography.

He was honoured with an Irish peerage. Hanger was the son of Sir George Hanger of Driffield, Gloucestershire and his wife Ann Beale daughter of Sir John Beale of Farningham in Kent. His father, grandson of Sir Lewis Roberts, was knighted by William III \\"for his steady attachment to religion and the law.\\" Hanger inherited his father's estate at Driffield and also inherited via his brother his mother's estate at Farningham. In 1750 he was responsible for converting the church at Driffield into the Italianate style. It was later converted back. Hanger sat as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidstone between 1753 and 1761. On 26 February 1762 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Coleraine.http://www.leighrayment.com/peers/peersC5.htm Hanger's uncle, John Hanger, was governor of the Bank of England 1719-1721 and his daughter, Anne, had married Henry (Henry Hare) 3rd and last Lord Coleraine. When Henry Hare died in 1749 without a legitimate heir the peerage had become extinct. It was revived in 1762 for Gabriel Hanger, who was made 1st Baron Coleraine of the second creation. As the peerage was Irish he was able to continue to sit in the House of Commons and was afterwards MP for Bridgwater between 1763 and 1768. He was described by his son as \\"one of those respectable, independent old English characters in the House of Commons called County Gentlemen\\". Lord Coleraine died at Bray, Berkshire at the age of 73 and was buried at Driffield. Hanger married Elizabeth Bond, daughter and heir of Richard Bond, of Hereford at Driffield in 1753. There were seven children which included three surviving sons John, William and George. George wrote a piece of doggerel :Three pretty boys did Gabriel get, :The youngest George by name, Sir :A funny dog, not favoured much :By fortune or by fame, Sir.

West Virginia, 220 U.S. 1 (1911), is a unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the state of West Virginia was bound by its constitution to pay one-third of the outstanding debt of the commonwealth of Virginia as of January 1, 1861.Virginia v. West Virginia, . In its ruling, the Supreme Court concluded that the geographic narrowness of the port and road improvements made by Virginia (most of which occurred outside West Virginia's current borders) were incurred by the people of the entire state and did not discharge West Virginia's duty to pay. The Court also held that Virginia's attempts to discharge its debts while its negotiations with West Virginia continued did not absolve West Virginia of its duty to pay. Although both states had already agreed on the amount to be paid, the Court ordered them to negotiate over interest computation. Background At the beginning of the American Civil War, Virginia seceded from the United States in 1861. But many of the northwestern counties of Virginia were decidedly pro- union.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 112.McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, 1988, p. 298. At a convention duly called by the governor and authorized by the legislature, delegates voted on April 17, 1861, to approve Virginia's secession from the United States.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 116. Although the resolution required approval from voters (at an election scheduled for May 23, 1861), Virginia's governor entered into a treaty of alliance with the Confederate States of America on April 24, elected delegates to the Confederate Congress on April 29, and formally entered the Confederacy on May 7.For President Lincoln, these actions proved that rebels had taken over the state and turned the machinery of the state toward insurrection. These individuals had not acted with popular support, and thus Lincoln felt justified later in recognizing the Reorganized Government. See: Kesavan and Paulsen, \\"Is West Virginia Unconstitutional?\\", California Law Review, March 2002, p. 311-312. Unionist sentiment was so high in the northwestern counties that civil government began to disintegrate, and the Wheeling Intelligencer newspaper called for a convention of delegates to meet in the city of Wheeling to consider secession from the state of Virginia.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 117-118. Delegates duly assembled, and at the First Wheeling Convention (also known as the May Convention), held May 13 to 15, the delegates voted to hold off on secession from Virginia until Virginia formally seceded from the United States.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 118-120.Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 438-439. Concerned that the irregular nature of the First Wheeling Convention might not democratically represent the will of the people, elections were scheduled for June 4 to formally elect delegates to a second convention, if necessary. Virginians voted to approve secession on May 23. On June 4, elections were held and delegates to a Second Wheeling Convention elected. These elections were irregular as well: Some were held under military pressure, some counties sent no delegates, some delegates never appeared, and voter turnout varied significantly.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 121.Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 441. On June 19, the Second Wheeling Convention declared the offices of all government officials who had voted for secession vacant, and reconstituted the executive and legislative branches of the Virginia government from their own ranks.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 121-122; Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 443-444. The Second Wheeling Convention adjourned on June 25 with the intent of reconvening on August 6.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 122. The new Reorganized Governor, Francis Harrison Pierpont, asked President Abraham Lincoln for military assistance,Kesavan and Paulsen, \\"Is West Virginia Unconstitutional?\\", California Law Review, March 2002, p. 312. and Lincoln recognized the new government.Kesavan and Paulsen, \\"Is West Virginia Unconstitutional?\\", California Law Review, March 2002, p. 300. The region elected new U.S. Senators and its two existing Representatives took their old seats in the House, effectively giving Congressional recognition to the Reorganized Government as well.Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 453. After reconvening on August 6, the Second Wheeling Convention again debated secession from Virginia. The delegates adopted a resolution authorizing the secession of 39 counties, with additional counties to be added if their voters approved, and authorizing any contiguous counties with these to join the new state if they so voted as well.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 123. On October 24, 1861, voters in 41 counties approved seceding from the commonwealth of Virginia.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 140; McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, 1988, p. 298-299; Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 451-452. The ballot also allowed voters to choose delegates to a constitutional convention, which met from November 26, 1861, to February 18, 1862.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 140-141. The constitutional convention chose the name \\"West Virginia\\" for the new state, and agreed to include a provision in the state constitution which provided for the new state to assume \\"an equitable portion\\" of the debt incurred by Virginia in developing and improving the counties which now formed the new state.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 141-144. The constitution required the state legislature to establish a sinking fund to repay the debt \\"as soon as practicable\\" but within at least 34 years (including interest). Article 8, ¬ß8 of the constitution read:Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 25. :An equitable proportion of the public debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia prior to the first day of January in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one shall be assumed by this state, and the legislature shall ascertain the same as soon as may be practicable, and provide for the liquidation thereof by a sinking fund sufficient to pay the accruing interest, and redeem the principal within thirty-four years. The convention adopted the new constitution on February 18, 1862, and the constitution was approved by voters about two months later on April 4.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 143, 146. Reorganized Governor Pierpont recalled the Reorganized state legislature, which voted on May 13 to approve the secession.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 146; Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 452. After much debate over whether Virginia had truly given its consent to the formation of the new state,Davis and Robertson, Virginia at War, 2005, p. 151.Kesavan and Paulsen, \\"Is West Virginia Unconstitutional?\\", California Law Review, March 2002, p. 301, 314-319. the United States Congress adopted a statehood bill on July 14, 1862.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 147; McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, 1988, p. 303-304; Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 460-461; Kesavan and Paulsen, \\"Is West Virginia Unconstitutional?\\", California Law Review, March 2002, p. 319. President Lincoln was unsure of the bill's constitutionality, but pressed by Northern senators he signed the legislation on December 31, 1862.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 149-150; Kesavan and Paulsen, \\"Is West Virginia Unconstitutional?\\", California Law Review, March 2002, p. 319-325. Luckily, the West Virginia constitutional convention had not adjourned sine die, and was called back into session on February 12, 1863, to amend the state's constitution to bring it in line with changes required by the federal statehood bill.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 112, 150. The convention amended the state's constitution on February 17 and adjourned sine die on February 20.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 151. The state's voters ratified the amended constitution on March 26, 1863. On April 20, President Lincoln announced that West Virginia would become a state in 60 days. In 1871, Virginia enacted legislation exchanging two-thirds of its outstanding bonds for new debt, and issuing certificates for the remaining one-third of the debt (which the state assumed would be paid by West Virginia) guaranteeing payment once the state's debt dispute with West Virginia was resolved.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 31. Virginia enacted legislation in 1879 reducing the interest rate on the outstanding one- third of the debt, but was unable to discharge the debt due to bondholder resistance.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 31-32. A second sale in 1882 also failed, and in 1892 Virginia issued new bonds to pay off the old one- third debt. Virginia established a commission in 1894 to negotiate with West Virginia over the debt, and in 1900 authorized the commission to accept the 1871 certificates from bondholders with the promise to pay once negotiations with West Virginia concluded.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 32. After years of negotiations over the proper amount of debt, Virginia brought suit before the U.S. Supreme Court (which, under Article Three of the United States Constitution has original jurisdiction over suits in which a state is a party). Admitting the secession of West Virginia and the transfer of property and debt as proper, Virginia sued to recover one-third the worth of its 1861 debt (or about $33 million).Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 22-24. For its part, West Virginia asserted that the one-third accounting was inaccurate, for it was based on the fact that West Virginia constituted one-third of the geographic size of the original state of Virginia and that most of the debt was incurred to improve areas now outside the boundaries of West Virginia.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 24. West Virginia claimed that under its constitution, only its state legislature could determine the amount of debt that was appropriate, and that Virginia's settlement with its bondholders was a bar to any suit.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 24-25. Furthermore, West Virginia refused to pay for the new certificates and bonds issued by Virginia or for stock purchases made by Virginia.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 30. Opinion of the Court Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. delivered the unanimous opinion of the court. Justice Holmes first reviewed Virginia's claim and West Virginia's answer, as well as the ordinances and relevant state constitutional language in question.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 22-27. Holmes observed that a special master had found West Virginia liable for about $33.9 million in debt, which West Virginia had not disputed.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 27. Holmes concluded that the Court was not required to apply existing law on debt, for a \\"state is superior to the forms that it may require of its citizens.\\"Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 27-28. A constitutional contract is not barred either, he said, so long as the \\"contemplated state\\" is actually created and so long as both contracting states and the United States had agreed to the terms.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 28, citing, in part, Wedding v. Meyler, 192 U.S. 573 (1904). The ordinance of the Second Wheeling Convention which first made reference to the debt was irrelevant in the proceedings, as it is neither referred to nor included in the West Virginia constitution, the legislation of the Reorganized Government of Virginia which consented to secession, or the statehood act passed by Congress.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 28. Holmes held against West Virginia's claim that the amount of debt should be reduced because the debt paid for improvements outside the boundaries of West Virginia. Although West Virginia was correct in observing that improvements were outside its boundaries, he wrote, the improvements were financed by state bonds and purchases of stock in corporations making the improvements.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 29-30. Since bond sales and stock purchases were made by the state on behalf of all citizens, all citizens shared in the risk and all citizens shared in the benefit. \\"...we should be lost in futile detail if we should try to unravel in each instance the ultimate scope of the scheme. ... All the expenditures had the ultimate good of the whole state in view. Therefore we adhere to our conclusion that West Virginia's share of the debt must be ascertained in a different way,\\" Holmes concluded. Nor was ascertaining the amount of debt to be left solely to the West Virginia legislature. Holmes pointed out the danger and inequitable nature of such a scheme, and asserted the Court's jurisdiction over the case:Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 30-31. :The provision in the Constitution of the State of West Virginia that the legislature shall ascertain the proportion as soon as may be practicable was not intended to undo the contract in the preceding words by making the representative and mouthpiece of one of the parties the sole tribunal for its enforcement. It was simply an exhortation and command from supreme to subordinate authority to perform the promise as soon as might be, and an indication of the way. Apart from the language used, what is just and equitable is a judicial question similar to many that arise in private litigation, and in no wise beyond the competence of a tribunal to decide. Having dealt with the foregoing issues, Holmes now confronted whether West Virginia had a duty to pay for the new bonds and certificates issued by Virginia between 1871 and 1900 in its attempt to discharge the one-third debt remaining on its books. The Supreme Court had ruled on the legality of Virginia's debt substitution and duty to pay in numerous cases over the past.Hartman v. Greenhow, 102 U.S. 672 (1880); Antoni v. Greenhow, 107 U.S. 769 (1883); Poindexter v. Greenhow 114 U.S. 269 (1885) [also known as the Virginia Coupon Cases]; Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 550 (1886); Chaffin v. Taylor, 116 U.S. 567 (1886); Royall v. Virginia, 116 U.S. 572 (1886); Sands v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 585 (1886); Royall v. Virginia, 121 U.S. 102 (1887); and In re Ayers, In re Scott and In re McCabe, 123 U.S. 443 (1887). Citing Hartman v. Greenhow, 102 U.S. 672 (1880) and McGahey v. Virginia, 135 U.S. 662 (1890), in particular, Holmes observed that the Court had already intimated that West Virginia had a duty to pay these outstanding debts, and now he reaffirmed that duty explicitly. West Virginia had argued that since Virginia had paid off the one-third debt, Virginia could no longer be a party to any debt suit against West Virginia. Under the criteria established in New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.S. 76 (1883), a state could not assume the private debts of its citizens and create an end-run around the Eleventh Amendment (which prevents federal courts from hearing suits brought by the citizen of one state against another state).Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 34. Holmes disagreed:Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 33-34. :The liability of West Virginia is a deepseated equity, not discharged by changes in the form of the debt, nor split up by the unilateral attempt of Virginia to apportion specific parts to the two states. If one-third of the debt were discharged in fact to all intents, we perceive no reason in what has happened why West Virginia should not contribute her proportion of the remaining two-thirds. But we are of opinion that no part of the debt is extinguished, and further, that nothing has happened to bring the rule of New Hampshire v. Louisiana into play. Furthermore, the contract contained in the West Virginia constitution provided additional for grounds for Virginia to be party to any suit. Holmes expressed the Court's concern over how to compute interest on the debt, given the large amount of time (a half-century) which had passed. The majority concluded that the states should negotiate over the matter, and another special master appointed if the issue proved contentious.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. at 35-36. The Court ordered West Virginia to pay its one-third portion of the debt, pending resolution of the interest computation question. ReferencesBibliography *Davis, William C. and Robertson, James I.

Built approximately 1750 as a residence, it is a good example of Georgian architecture. The tavern is historically significant because of its association with the march of Rochambeau's army during the American Revolutionary War, on their way to the Battle of Yorktown. The building, now a private residence, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The former Oliver White Tavern is located a short way east of the village center of Bolton, at the southeast corner of Bolton Center Road and Brandy Street. The house is oriented facing west, toward the town center, and is directly across the street from a large field. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, center chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a seven-light transom window, and framed by simple stepped moulding. The tavern was built about 1750, and is a well-preserved example of domestic Georgian architecture. The land where the house stands was purchased by Oliver White in 1741. He sold the land with a house in 1743. It was used as a dwelling until sometime between 1753 and 1764, when it was converted for use to a tavern. The building was no long owned by Oliver White when it became a tavern, but it was traditional at that time to keep the original owner's name even after sale, so it became known as the Oliver White Tavern. Encampment site of Rochambeau's army The tavern is significant for its association with the historic march of the French Army from Providence, Rhode Island to Yorktown, Virginia in 1781. Records show that the army made its fifth camp in the field across Bolton Center Road. A map prepared by French engineers identifies a building at this site, marked as a tavern. It was typical of the period for soldiers to camp in the fields, with officers typically housed in local taverns or houses of prominent local residents.

Dubrovin: Geometry of 2D topological field theories. In: Springer LNM, 1620 (1996), pp. 120‚Äì348., is a flat Riemannian manifold with a certain compatible multiplicative structure on the tangent space. The concept generalizes the notion of Frobenius algebra to tangent bundles. Frobenius manifolds occur naturally in the subject of symplectic topology, more specifically quantum cohomology. The broadest definition is in the category of Riemannian supermanifolds. We will limit the discussion here to smooth (real) manifolds. A restriction to complex manifolds is also possible.  Definition  Let M be a smooth manifold. An affine flat structure on M is a sheaf Tf of vector spaces that pointwisely span TM the tangent bundle and the tangent bracket of pairs of its sections vanishes. As a local example consider the coordinate vectorfields over a chart of M. A manifold admits an affine flat structure if one can glue together such vectorfields for a covering family of charts. Let further be given a Riemannian metric g on M. It is compatible to the flat structure if g(X, Y) is locally constant for all flat vector fields X and Y. A Riemannian manifold admits a compatible affine flat structure if and only if its curvature tensor vanishes everywhere. A family of commutative products * on TM is equivalent to a section A of S2(T*M) ‚äó TM via :X*Y = A(X,Y). \\\\, We require in addition the property :g(X*Y,Z)=g(X,Y*Z). \\\\, Therefore, the composition g#‚àòA is a symmetric 3-tensor. This implies in particular that a linear Frobenius manifold (M, g, *) with constant product is a Frobenius algebra M. Given (g, Tf, A), a local potential Œ¶ is a local smooth function such that :g(A(X,Y),Z)=X[Y[Z[\\\\Phi ] \\\\, for all flat vector fields X, Y, and Z. A Frobenius manifold (M, g, *) is now a flat Riemannian manifold (M, g) with symmetric 3-tensor A that admits everywhere a local potential and is associative.  Elementary properties  The associativity of the product * is equivalent to the following quadratic PDE in the local potential Œ¶ : \\\\Phi_{,abe}g^{ef}\\\\Phi_{,cdf} = \\\\Phi_{,ade}g^{ef}\\\\Phi_{,bcf} \\\\, where Einstein's sum convention is implied, Œ¶,a denotes the partial derivative of the function Œ¶ by the coordinate vectorfield ‚àÇ/‚àÇxa which are all assumed to be flat. gef are the coefficients of the inverse of the metric. The equation is therefore called associativity equation or Witten‚ÄìDijkgraaf‚ÄìVerlinde‚ÄìVerlinde (WDVV) equation.  Examples  Beside Frobenius algebras, examples arise from quantum cohomology. Namely, given a semipositive symplectic manifold (M, œâ) then there exists an open neighborhood U of 0 in its even quantum cohomology QHeven(M, œâ) with Novikov ring over C such that the big quantum product *a for a in U is analytic. Now U together with the intersection form g = <¬∑,¬∑> is a (complex) Frobenius manifold. The second large class of examples of Frobenius manifolds come from the singularity theory. Namely, the space of miniversal deformations of an isolated singularity has a Frobenius manifold structure. This Frobenius manifold structure also relates to Kyoji Saito's primitive forms.

He started his public activities in the late 1980s. From the very beginning of the independence movement in Estonia, he affiliated himself with pro- independence forces, which had close ties with Soviet-era dissidents. He played an active role in building up free media in then occupied Estonia, being among the founders of the Independent Info Centre in 1988. He was the leader of the Estonian Free Party.  Education and training  His alma mater is the University of Tartu, where he obtained a first degree in psychology (cum laude, 1985) and an M.A. degree in history (1998, thesis on ancient Indian philosophy). He was greatly inspired by his then professor, well-known Estonian orientalist Linnart M√§ll (1938-2010), whose work in the Unrepresented Peoples and Nations Organization (UNPO) he followed with keen interest.  Professional career  Andres Herkel Andres Herkel began his professional career as researcher in the Estonian Institute of Pedagogical Research (1985-1989), followed by posts of editor of the literary journal Vikerkaar (1990-1991), editor-in-chief of Eesti Elu/Kultuur ja Elu (Estonian Life/Culture and Life) journal (1991-1992) and lecturer in the Estonian Institute of Humanities. In 1993-1999 he worked as Media Adviser in the Pro Patria faction of the Riigikogu (Estonian Parliament). In 1994, Herkel joined the conservative Pro Patria party (now known as the Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica - IRL). In 1999 he was for the first time elected to Riigikogu. In 2004 - 2007 he was Chairperson of the Pro Patria faction in Riigikogu. He currently serves his fourth term in parliament, having been re-elected in the recent elections in March 2011. In national politics, Herkel is he well known for his commitment to conservative values and for his conciliatory approach. He was the driving force behind the adoption of the statement on crimes of communism (link) in the Estonian Parliament (2002), which was approved by an impressive consensus. Throughout his political career, Herkel has also focused on international affairs. Since 2003 he has been member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), where he has held significant positions: Head of the Estonian delegation since 2007, Vice-President of the PACE (2009-2011), rapporteur on the honouring of obligations and commitments by Azerbaijan (2004-2010) and the situation in Belarus (since 2011). In Azerbaijan his stern stance with the authorities won him much respect among human rights defenders and civil society activists. He has participated in various PACE election observation missions in Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. He is also committed to pursuing the cause of human rights in Northern Caucasus, Cuba and Tibet. His articles on foreign policy are regularly published in Estonian press. In his campaign for the March 2011 parliamentary elections in Estonia, Herkel used small pepper-bags called ‚ÄûHerkel‚Äôs pepper-mix‚Äú with an aim of averting his electorate that too sweet campaign promises are counterproductive and unrealistic. He warned against repeating the same fiscal mistakes that had been made before the 2008-2010 economic crises in Estonia. Herkel is a long-standing member of the Estonian Broadcasting Council (1994-2000 and 2007-2011) and Vice-President of Estonian Academic Oriental Society (2000-2011).  Publications  Andres Herkel has published several books in Estonian, including ‚ÄûThe Russian Puzzle‚Äú (Vene m√µistatus, 2007) ‚ÄûCuba in my Heart‚Äú (Kuuba s√ºdames, together with former PM Mart Laar, 2008) and ‚ÄûAzerbaijani letters‚Äù (Aserbaid≈æaani kirjad, 2010).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History In 1916 John E. Matton moved his ship building business south from Waterford to Van Schaick Island, and the shipyard would continue to build canal boats, barges, tugboats, and police boats until closing in 1983. From December 1941 to July 1943 during World War II the shipyard produced five SC-497 class submarine chasers, SC-985 through SC-989 for the US Navy, and from February‚ÄìJune 1944 four tugs for the US Army. In 1945 four of the sub chasers went to service with the US Coast Guard while SC-986 went to the USSR. At the time of closing it was one of the longest operating tug and barge shipbuilders in the United States. The shipyard is currently owned by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) as part of the Peebles Island State Park, which is turning the shipyard into an educational center, museum, and home for historic vessels.

These cremation urns where the cremated remains of the dead were placed in, were beautifully decorated with figurative designs of humans and animals. The Japodian burial urn art was a unique form of art influenced to a degree by the Situla art of northern Illyria and Italy and by Greek art. The urns represent one of the best Japodian figurative art forms. The first urn was discovered in 1890 in the necropolis of Jezerina near Bihaƒá. In this fragment the face of a warrior was presented with a helmet, a drinking horn on the right hand and with a spear on the left hand. Almost all of the scenes are linked with the cult of the dead. The urns are broken up in three phases, grouped up chronologically. The earliest date from the 5th century BC and even probably from the start of the 4th century BC and depict figures related with those of the situla art. The Japodian artists which created the early urns were inspired by the situla art and took many motives from this art, but which transformed the images in order to suit their own tastes. From this the second phase was created but with a much smaller yield. The second phase is linked with Greek art.

It is situated in the Heddon Valley, on Exmoor. The population at the 2011 census was 293. A number Bronze Age barrows exist nearby, along with several other small earth-works throughout the parish. Beacon Castle and Voley Castle both Iron Age Hill forts are situated nearby. Rowley Barton (\\"rough clearing\\") was a manor mentioned in the Domesday Book along with East and West Middleton. Holwell Castle, at Parracombe was a Norman motte and bailey castle built to guard the junction of the east-west and north-south trade routes, enabling movement of people and goods and the growth of the population. Alternative explanations for its construction suggest it may have been constructed to obtain taxes at the River Heddon bridging place, or to protect and supervise silver mining in the area around Combe Martin. It was in diameter and high above the bottom of a rock cut ditch which is deep. It was built in the late 11th or early 12th century. Parracombe's St Petrock's Church is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

Sylacauga marble, also commonly known as Alabama marble, is a marble that is found in a belt running through Talladega County, Alabama. It is prized for its pure white color and its crystalline structure. The stone is named after the town of Sylacauga, Alabama, which is sometimes called \\"the Marble City\\". Sylacauga marble has been called the \\"world's whitest\\". Discovered in 1814, it has been mined for over 160 years, and is used for building, sculpture, and industry. The Alabama Legislature passed Act 755 on September 12, 1969, which made this marble the state's official rock. Occurrence Sylacauga marble occurs mainly in Alabama's Talladega County. It runs in a swath in length, from the Coosa River to just south of the city of Talladega. The deposit is up to in depth and is focused on the city of Sylacauga, for which it is named. Mining Bust of Abraham Lincoln by Gutzon Borglum in the United States Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C. The first quarry that was developed to mine the marble was that of physician Edward Gantt, established in 1834. The George Herd Family consolidated several smaller quarries shortly thereafter and sold the first quarried marble from the area in 1838 for use as funerary monuments. These and various other quarry operations expanded during the last decades of the nineteenth century. Italian sculptor Giuseppe Moretti discovered the marble while in Alabama during 1903. He was working on the massive Vulcan statue for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, commissioned by the Commercial Club of Birmingham. He established the Moretti-Harrah Marble Company, which exposed other areas of the country to Sylacauga marble. Major mining operations today include Omya, Sylacauga Marble Mining, and Canadian Polycor Company. Although the pure white color is most widely known in the market, portions of the deposit produce types with bodies or veining in black, pink, gray, and yellow hues. Uses Sylacauga marble is fine-grained and nearly pure calcite, making it extremely similar to white Carrara marble. Sylacauga marble was used for Gutzon Borglum's bust of Abraham Lincoln in the United States Capitol rotunda. He commented that the stone's fine texture let him portray the expression of kindness on Lincoln‚Äôs face, something he had never been able to do with other stones. It has been used extensively for architectural projects. Some examples of interior architectural use of Sylacauga marble include the translucent ceiling of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., the United States Supreme Court Building (most of the interior, except courtroom) in Washington D.C., the National Metropolitan Bank Building in Washington D.C., the Army and Navy Club Building in Washington D.C., the rotunda of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in Manhattan, the Mercedes-Benz showroom in Manhattan, the Old Chicago Main Post Office in Chicago, the Kesner Building in Chicago, the University Club in Chicago, the Select Council Chamber of City Hall in Philadelphia, the Brown Marx Building in Birmingham, Alabama, the Florence Hotel in Birmingham, and the Alabama Department of Archives and History in Montgomery, Alabama. Use of the marble as an exterior building material includes the Dime Savings Bank of New York in Brooklyn, the former Connecticut Savings Bank (now Wells Fargo) in New Haven, Connecticut, the Somerset County Courthouse in Somerville, New Jersey, the main building of the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, J. Ogden Armour's Mellody Farm in Lake Forest, Illinois, the Atlantic National Bank Building in Jacksonville, Florida, the old United States Post Office in Mobile, Alabama (demolished), the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Temple in Washington D.C., and the Chrysler Mausoleum in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Aside from use as sculptural media and as a building stone, Sylacauga marble is also used in industry as a paint pigment, for pharmaceuticals, as a coating to whiten high-quality paper, and other purposes. It is also used in agriculture as a soil amendment.
