(an acronym for Straight to Hell), also known as The Manhattan Review of Unnatural Acts, is an American gay pornography and erotic non-fiction zine founded by Boyd McDonald. It publishes autobiographical stories of male-male sexual encounters, as submitted by the magazine's readership. First published in the early 1970s, S.T.H. became an influential publication in New York City's arts and culture spheres, and counted notable literary figures such as William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Gore Vidal among its readership. History The precise date of S.T.H.s founding is unknown; the earliest known issue is #2, dated 1973. Publication is irregular, and early issues were not always dated nor copyrighted. The magazine was founded by Boyd McDonald, who edited the magazine from the early seventies through the mid-eighties. McDonald created S.T.H. as a magazine of reader-submitted male-male sex stories following his experience creating Skinheads, a zine about foreskin fetishism. McDonald edited, typeset, mimeographed, and hand-assembled early issues of S.T.H. from a series of transient furnished rooms on the Upper West Side in Manhattan. Printing costs were paid with McDonald's welfare checks, with McDonald once joking that S.T.H. \\"was the only gay-sex magazine funded by the US government.\\" At its peak, the magazine had a circulation of twenty thousand, which provided McDonald a modest income that he spent on male escorts. McDonald turned over editorship of S.T.H. to Victor Weaver in the mid-1980s, and began focusing on publishing a series of anthologies that collected stories from the magazine (see Anthologies below); Meat, the first volume in the series, sold over 50,000 copies. Weaver was more readily accepting of S.T.H.s popularity in New York's arts and culture scene, and threw parties for the magazine at venues such as Danceteria and the Pyramid Club. Billy Miller became editor of S.T.H. in 1989, and in 2007 began a project to digitize back issues of the magazine. S.T.H. #68, the most recent issue of the magazine, was published in 2017 and edited by Miller. Content S.T.H. consists primarily of readers' submissions of stories of their sexual experiences. Submissions are edited only for length, with spelling and grammar errors intentionally left uncorrected; McDonald stated that \\"I find men who don't use punctuation are more fun in bed than those who do.\\" McDonald encouraged contributors to read Ernest Hemingway and William S. Burroughs, and emulate their direct and unadorned writing style. He would often correspond with contributors, asking them detailed questions about their sexual habits and printing their answers. Stories were printed under titles that parodied tabloid newspaper headlines. The magazine also published pornographic images, both reader-contributed and sourced from studios such as Old Reliable and the Athletic Model Guild. Issues published under McDonald's editorship also contained his commentary on sex, culture, and politics, particularly what he perceived as the hypocrisies of individuals and celebrities who were not fully accepting of their own desires. Subtitles Though S.T.H. is most commonly subtitled as The Manhattan Review of Unnatural Acts, the magazine is published under an ever-changing variety of subtitles, several of which parody the titles of other publications or reference other works: * New York Review of Unnatural Acts * U.S. Chronicle of Crimes Against Nature * The American Journal of Dick Licking * New York Review of Cocksucking (New York Review of Books) * The Manhattan Review of Cocksucking * American Journal of Cocksucking and Current Affairs * Archives of the American Academy of Homosexual Research * The North American Horndog Reader * New Amsterdam Journal of Trade * The Manatus Raunch Gazette * The Urania Spurting Times * Feeled and Creemed * Splorch Illustrated (Sports Illustrated) * The Official Organ of The Great East Ball Lickers Union ‚Äì Local 6942 * W.H.O.R.E.

He described the magazine as being \\"not for the upward striving middle class but for guys who like to go down;\\" Bernard Welt argues that the S.T.H. represented McDonald's desire to replace pornography with smut, which he saw as \\"sex that is truthful, idiosyncratic, and honest even about its own reason for being.\\" S.T.H. counted multiple luminaries in arts and literature among its readership, consequently earning the nickname \\"the cumrag of the stars\\" from its editors. Notable readers include William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Christopher Isherwood, Tennessee Williams, Robert Mapplethorpe, Larry Mitchell, David Sedaris, John Mitzel, and Gore Vidal, with Vidal once describing the magazine as \\"one of the best radical papers in the country.\\" Parties organized by S.T.H. were attended by John Waters, Fran Lebowitz. Kenneth Anger, Quentin Crisp, Taylor Mead, Cookie Mueller and Jackie Curtis. Felice Picano cited S.T.H. as a prominent gay publication in the 1970s and 80s. Conversely, John Preston was a critic of S.T.H., calling its readership \\"dirty\\", \\"filthy\\", \\"sick\\", \\"kinky\\", and \\"twisted\\".From Preston's review of S.T.H. in Numbers magazine, quoted by McDonald in S.T.H. #46, p. 34. In 2008, the Berlin-based art gallery Exile hosted \\"Straight To Hell presents: In Cock We Trust\\", an exhibition of S.T.H. material.

It is the third game to be created by Angel based upon Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon sh≈çjo manga and anime series, as well as the second title in the franchine for Super Famicom, serving as the sequel to Sailor Moon. Following the second season of the anime series, which adapted the second arc of the manga,Sailormoon Channel Name of story arc given on the official website. the players control one of the six Sailor Guardians and fight against enemies across several locations in order to protect Earth from both the Hell Tree aliens led by Ail and Ann as well as the Black Moon Clan led by Prince Demand, who are attempting to steal life energy from humans and the Star Points of future Crystal Tokyo. Like its predecessor, the game was met with mixed reception from critics since its release.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. As with its predecessor, Bish≈çjo Senshi Sailor Moon R is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game where players take control either of the five original Sailor Soldiers across various stages, each one set in a different location, and fight against an assortment of enemies and villains from the series in order to defeat the Hell Tree aliens and the Black Moon Clan.ÁæéÂ∞ëÂ•≥Êà¶Â£´„Çª„Éº„É©„Éº„É†„Éº„É≥R ÂèñÊâ±Ë™¨ÊòéÊõ∏ (Super Famicom, JP) Each Soldier has a special attack of their own that deals damage to all enemies on-screen at once by charging it. Each Soldier also has different attributes during gameplay, encouraging players to select their preferred character. A new addition to the sequel is the ability to play as Chibiusa in her own game mode. Another addition is a versus fighting game mode, where players choose between any Sailor Senshi and fight against other opponents in one-on-one matches and the fighter who manages to deplete the health bar of the opponent wins the bout.  Development and release  Bish≈çjo Senshi Sailor Moon R was developed by most of the original team who worked in the previous Sailor Moon title exclusively for Super Famicom. Bish≈çjo Senshi Sailor Moon R on Super Famicom, which was released exclusively in Japan by Bandai on December 29, 1993, was once again created by a team comprised from staff of the titular sh≈çjo manga and anime series, with producer J≈çji Yuno at Angel heading development, who recounted its making process and history in an official strategy guide by Kodansha from May 1994, five months after the game's release to the market. (Translation by Tuxedo Unmasked. ). Yuno claimed that the \\"Chibiusa\\" mode, which was geared towards a much younger audience, grew beyond the staff's expectation and stated that there were still mysteries behind Chibiusa's character and decided removing her from the main game and create a separate mode instead after the team were worried and debated how she should be implemented in the project, as they thought Chibiusa getting attacked by enemies would not look right due to her height. The team dediced to introduce the parasol Chibiusa had since her appearance as a weapon, stating that this made up for her difference with enemies' height and was \\"a lot cuter than Chibiusa directly punching and kicking the enemies.\\" However, the parasol shoots energy stars instead when attacking enemies, as Yuno claimed that \\"from the point of view of child- rearing, it‚Äôs not ideal to be hitting enemies directly with an umbrella\\". In regards to the Sailor Soldiers, Yuno stated it was difficult to conceive new moves as the team previously struggled to come up with attack moves during development of their previous Sailor Moon release but were able to implement moves that were initially scrapped due to memory space constrains, however characters such as Sailor Venus had her moveset slightly altered. Yuno also stated that the game's special attack that damages enemies onscreen had just barely debuted in the anime series and was borrowed for the project. However, Yuno claimed that the reasons for conceiving the joint attack moves used in co-op play was because of hardware issued when using the screen-clearing attack and \\"add meaning\\" in the two-player mode, as the team did not wanted co-op play to be just two players in the single-player mode. Yuno also claimed the team was happy with their ability to implement multiple hidden moves, among other elements. The team at Angel also made enemies stronger, with some being lifted from the original manga, however some characters like Esmeraude had their moveset rearranged prior to launch. The team also added a two-player versus fighting mode, as the team originally planned to implement a fighting game mode in their previous Sailor Moon release but were unable to do so, due to the increased memory space capacity. Despite the increased memory space, however, various elements were ultimately dropped such as Sailor Pluto being a playable character in both single-player and two-player versus modes.

Ferdinand was part of the Van den Eynde family, and brother of the wealthy banker and merchant Jan van den Eynde. He should not be confused with the latter's son Ferdinand. Ferdinand's collection included paintings by the likes of Pieter van Laer, Paul Bril, Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Miel. Ferdinand van den Eynde is also remembered for being the subject of Duquesnoy's oeuvre Tomb of Ferdinand van den Eynde. Early life Van den Eynde was born in Antwerp, into a wealthy family of artists and merchants. The Van den Eynde were related by blood and marriage to several prominent Netherlandish artists, including Brueghel, Jode, and Lucas and Cornelis de Wael. Lucas and Cornelis de Wael were Ferdinand's nephews. Ferdinand van den Eynde was married to Susanna de Jode, aunt of Jan Brueghel. Move to Italy Sometime in the early 17th century (possibly in 1612) Van den Eynde moved to Italy, possibly alone. He settled in Venice first, where he reportedly was active between 1612 and 1617. While in Venice, he likely lived with his nephews Lucas and Cornelis de Wael. He reportedly moved to Genoa in 1619, before finally settling in Southern Italy. Ferdinand was resident in Naples until 1626, whereafter he moved to Rome. He resided there for the rest of his life, dying prematurely in Rome in 1630. Van den Eynde was part of the Netherlandish community of expatriates in Rome. Two days before his death, Van den Eynde made his will, bequeathing his art collection to his brother Jan, who had meanwhile settled in Naples. Ferdinand van den Eynde was buried in the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome. His nephew Cornelis de Wael was buried next to him. Epitaph Van den Eynde's tomb was commissioned from Fran√ßois Duquesnoy. Duquesnoy's oeuvre, located in the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome, was lauded by Duquesnoy's contemporaries, and remains much appreciated today, especially for its putti.

The Guild was established in 1923 at Ipswich and covers over 200 rings of bells in the county of Suffolk in the area that falls within the diocese boundary. Origins Prior to the creation of the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the western half of the county was part of the Diocese of Ely and the eastern half was part of the Diocese of Norwich and therefore ringers were members of the respective associations being the Ely Diocesan Association and the Norwich Diocesan Association. After the diocese was created in 1914 Ely Diocesan Association adopted the name 'The Ely and St. Edmundsbury Diocesan Association' whilst the Norwich Diocesan Association was known as 'The Norwich and Ipswich Association.' The impetus for the formation of an Suffolk association came mainly from the west of the county but this met with much opposition particularly from Norwich Diocese. The Suffolk County Association, the first solely Suffolk based ringing organisation, was formed on 5 February 1921, at Lavenham, under the mastership of Stedman Symonds, but soon changed its name to the Suffolk Diocesan Association at Easter. On 29 April 1922, there was another change of name to the St. Edmundsbury and Ipswich Diocesan Association. Finally on 2 April 1923 the Suffolk Guild of Ringers was formed after a meeting at St. Mary le Tower Church House, Ipswich with Charles Sedgley being elected master and Rev. Herbert Drake as secretary. Operations As of the end of 2019 the Guild has 776 members from 198 towers with ringable bells. Its listed objects are to supporting the recruitment and training of bellringers and cultivating the art of scientific ringing alongside promoting and supporting the restoration and augmentation of rings of bells. The Guild is affiliated to the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers (CCCBR), a global organisation representing all those who practice Change ringing, and currently sends four representatives to be part of the Council. Governance A mixture of elected and appointed officers run the Guild with Guild Management Committee being the main decision making body. The chairman, secretary, treasurer, and ringing master make up the executive and are trustees of Guild which is registered as a charity. The Guild is split into four districts to encourage ringing at a local level through education and training. Each district covers a geographical quarter of the diocese, North East, South East, North West, and South West electing their own ringing master, secretary, treasurer along with representatives to the Guild's committees. Ringing Aside from regular religious services, ringing is often conducted for special occasions such as anniversaries, memorials and other locally or nationally significant events. There are weekly evening practices held at around 80 towers across the Guild where all skills of change ringing are taught and practiced including method ringing. Each district in Guild has a rolling programme of monthly events at a different towers allowing ringers to socialise and practice more advance ringing, events will include outings outside of the Guild, striking contests, and socials. The members of the Guild regularly ring peals, as defined by the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers. Between its formation and the end of 2019 there has been 9812 peals rung for the Guild. Quarter peals, which are performances of continuous method ringing last approximately 45 mins, are also regularly rung by members with around 530 being recorded in 2019. The Bell Tower at Beccles which is operated by the Guild on behalf of the Town CouncilGuild members ringing at Holy Innocents, Great Barton Events=Striking contests There are three annual striking competitions held by the Guild as well as a number held at district level. The three Guild contests are: *Rose trophy for eight bell method ringing *Mitson shield for six bell method ringing *Lester Brett trophy for six bell call change ringing A combined band is sent represent the Guild as a whole at the East Anglian Ridgman trophy for ten bell method ringing. Ipswich Christmas Ringing Since 1993 Guild members have rung all the bells at the churches in Ipswich town centre on the Saturday before Christmas. St Edmund's day The Guild supported the campaign to restore Edmund the Martyr as patron saint of England by coordinating annual ringing of bells across Suffolk on his feast day of the 20 November due to his connection with Suffolk. Ringing for Peace Armistice 100 On the 100th anniversary of the armistice November 2018 members of the Guild rang the bells at all the ringable towers in the diocese in a single day to mark the commemorations, a feat which had never been attempted before.

It forms part of a group of basins of similar age along the west coast of Norway between Sognefjord and Nordfjord, related to movement on the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment. It formed as a result of extensional tectonics as part of the post-orogenic collapse of crust that was thickened during the Caledonian Orogeny towards the end of the Silurian period. It is named for the mountain Hornelen on the northern margin of the basin. Tectonic setting During the later part of the Silurian period, the western margin of the Baltic Plate was affected by the main collisional event of the Caledonian orogeny, known as the Scandian phase. This led to large-scale thrusting and the development of a mountain belt similar in scale to the Himalayas. Soon after the collision finished during the Early Devonian, the thickened crust began to extend. Initially the extension took place by reactivation of Caledonian thrust faults, known as Mode 1 extension. The uplift and exhumation led to a reduction of dip in these reactivated thrusts, making them progressively less mechanically viable. At this point Mode II extension took over, with development of large extensional shear zones that cross-cut the Caledonian thrust pile, such as the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment. Basin fill The dominant lithology is sandstone, which is organised into a series of coarsening-upward cycles, laid down by a west-draining axial river system. At the basin margins the sandstones interfinger with conglomerates deposited by alluvial fans. The northern conglomerates were deposited by mainly debris flow fans, while those to the south are mainly streamflow in type. Near the northern margin there is a zone where siltstones and mudstones are developed, forming the finest-grained sediments in the basin. The depositional environment for these fine-grained rocks is thought to be lacustrine. Age The sequence has been dated as Devonian, based on Middle Devonian plant fossils found in the upper part of the succession. Clast provenance The study of clast lithology within the Hornelen sequence has been used to understand the exposed geology in the areas that provided a sediment source for the basin. The currently exposed bedrock to the north and east of the basin consist of metamorphic rocks of the Western Gneiss Region (WGR) that have been affected by ultra-high-pressure metamorphism, which are everywhere in faulted contact with the basin. No clasts have been found that have evidence of high-pressure metamorphism indicating that the WGR did not become exposed at the surface until after the highest preserved levels of the basin were deposited. The clasts do match well with the rock types observed within the Caledonian thrust sheets on which the Devonian sediments lie unconformably to the west of the basin. Structure The Devonian sequence has an overall eastward dip of 20‚Äì25¬∞, from the unconformable contact in the west up to the tectonic contact in the east. This is modified near the northern and southern margins. Towards the northern margin the direction of dip becomes more southeasterly. Near the southern margin the basin is folded into a west‚Äìsouthwest trending anticline and syncline, parallel to the faulted margin. There is little evidence of internal faulting in the basin, although fracture sets are well-developed and two stages of vein development have been observed. The northern margin of the basin is formed by a steep south-dipping fault that is interpreted to be mainly post-Devonian brittle structure that has formed close to the original basin edge. The southern margin is formed by the steep north-dipping Hauk√• Fault, which is interpreted to increase in displacement westwards, locally cutting out the alluvial fan deposits, although it is still regarded as being close to the original basin edge. The eastern margin is formed by a low-angle extensional fault, known as the Hornelen Detachment, part of the larger scale Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment (NSD). It juxtaposes the Devonian basin fill against mylonites of the NSD shear zone that underlies the basin. Origin The Hornelen sequence, in common with other Old Red Sandstone sequences in Norway, Scotland and Greenland was originally described as deposited in an intermontane depression with most faulting being post-depositional. The first tectonic model for the basin was developed in 1964, with an eastward migrating depocentre proposed in a downthrown basin between two high-angle normal faults with sedimentation keeping pace with eastward propagation of the faults. In 1977 a strike-slip pull-apart basin model was proposed, by analogy with basins developed along the San Andreas Fault system, with the cyclicity explained as a result of periodic fault activity. In 1984 another extensional model was proposed and this was supported in 1986 by the recognition of the underlying Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment, a major extensional structure with tens of kms of displacement.

The band filmed two more videos for \\"Disease\\" and \\"Two More Reasons\\". In 1996 a gun was pulled on vocalist Blayne Alexander at The Unicorn in Milwaukee which caused the band to cancel several tour dates.

The property, including a detached atelier, a jetty with a bathhouse and a number of other outbuildings, were listed in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1993. The ample use of wood ornamentation and polychromy are both tell-tale features of this particular architectural style. The name of the building was inspired by a relief of a horseman located above the main entrance. Barbicaia at Nordre Strandvej 232 dates from the same year and was also designed by Nyrop but has undergone considerable alterations and is therefore not listed. History Frants Henningsen: Summer day on the beach at Hornb√¶k with children playing. Frants Henningsen and his friends P. S: Kr√∏yer, Viggo Johansen and Kristian Zahrtmann visited Hornb√¶k in 1873. They were later coined by other artists, including Holger Drachmann and Carl Locher, forming what would become Denmark's first artist colony. Nordre Strandvej was constructed in 1874‚Äì1879 as a more direct link between Helsing√∏r and Helleb√¶k than Hammerm√∏llevej (now Gammel Gelleb√¶kvej). The fashionable Hotel Marienlyst was located at the beginning of the new road and many of the first buildings along it were summer retreats for wealthy citizens from Copenhagen or Helsing√∏r. Rytterhuset viewed from the road Henningsen did not follow Kr√∏yer, Johansen and most of the other Hornb√¶k artists when they moved to Skagen in the early 1880s. In 1889, he commissioned Martin Nyrop to design a summer house for him and his family in √Ölsg√•rde. Henningsen's wife Thora was a daughter of the painter Frederik Vermehren. They had five children, including Thorkild Henningsen. The family lived in an apartment on the second floor at √òsterbrogade 46 in Copenhagen when Rytterhuset was completed but moved to an apartment in the Behagen House on Strandgade the following year. Architecture The two-storey house is constructed in yellow-washed brick contrasted by a wealth of carved wooden details painted in Swedish red and other strong colours. The red-painted bargeboards are decorated with blue- and white-painted carved animal heads. Above the covered main entrance in the south gable is a relief of a horseman. An outbuilding with kitchen and washroom projects from the west side of the building. and on its east side is a veranda. Nyrop, who had a background as a carpenter, had just experienced his breakthrough as an architect with his design of the buildings for the 1888 Nordic Exhibition in Copenhagen. He constructed all his exhibition pavilions of wood at a time when iron and glass was favored for temporary structures, justifying the decision by claiming the result would be prettier for the same cost. Both Rytterhuset and many of his buildings for the Nordic Exhibition (cf. Det Norske Hus) were inspired by Nordic Vernacular architecture, wood ornamentation and polychromy which mirror the National romantic currents in architecture at the time. Other buildings include a shed for firewood, an annex building, a garden pavilion. an atelier, a garage and a jettu with a bathhouse.

He was a sports columnist for The Province, focusing primarily on hockey, basketball, and tennis until his retirement. In 2020, he was the recipient of the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award for excellence in hockey journalism. Early life and education Gallagher was born in 1948. He graduated from Vancouver College in 1966 and attended the University of British Columbia (UBC) for his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and economics. While enrolled at UBC, Gallagher worked for the school paper, The Ubyssey, covering local sports. In 1967, he approached The Province sports editor Don Brown and asked if he could write game stories on the UBC Thunderbirds men‚Äôs basketball team; Brown agreed and paid him $10 per story. Career Upon graduating from UBC, Gallagher was immediately hired by The Province as their local sports journalist, covering the WHL‚Äôs New Westminster Bruins and the Vancouver Blazers. By 1976, he became a beat reporter for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) and earned his own sports column in 1987 while also expanding his coverage to tennis, motorsport and basketball. During his tenure as a beat reporter, Gallagher earned the nickname \\"The Undertaker\\" from Canucks General Manager Jake Milford for his \\"dogged pursuit of a story and willingness to bury someone when called for.\\" He covered the Canucks' 1982 Stanley Cup Finals loss to the New York Islanders, which he later published in his first co-authored book titled Towels, Triumph and Tears: The Vancouver Canucks and Their Amazing Drive to the 1982 Stanley Cup Final. As a sports columnist, Gallagher participated in public feuds with Canucks general managers Pat Quinn and later Brian Burke. During Quinn's tenure as GM, Gallagher uncovered that he sent a trainer with a $100,000 cheque to a Los Angeles Kings morning skate at the Coliseum and signed an illegal bonus when becoming the team's new general manager. By the time of his death in 2014, Gallagher said \\"I changed my mind about Pat rather late in life. I realized so many people loved him. And when there are so many people whose value and judgment you trust love a guy, then he must be all right.\\" He also uncovered how Quinn failed to make transfer payments to Russia, which was used by the cross examiners against Quinn. Gallagher left The Province to work in sports radio at CKWX and then took a two-year sabbatical. Upon his return, Burke attempted to bar Gallagher and Province writers from the dressing room and panned a letter to the editor-in-chief Brian Butters ordering him to fire Gallagher. Butters refused and ran the letter on the front page in an act of defiance. Burke reasoned his letter by accusing Gallagher of ‚Äúscurrilous editorial attacks.‚Äù Burke argued that the animosity between him and Gallagher stemmed from him refusing to give Gallagher \\"the scoop on his Vancouver appointment\\" in 1998. By the time Gallagher retired from The Province in 2015, he had covered three Winter Olympics including hockey, speed skating, figure skating, and skiing. Awards and honours In 2013, Gallagher was inducted into Vancouver College's Hall of Honour. While vacationing with his wife in Hawaii in 2018, he was informed that he had been inducted into B.C. Sports Hall of Fame and returned home early to attend the induction ceremony. Two years later, Gallagher was named the recipient of the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award for excellence in hockey journalism.

It was formed from an area that belonged to Grey County and, at disestablishment, merged back into Grey County. History In September 1887, some residents petitioned the governor, Sir William Jervois, to have Brunner (at the time still commonly called Brunnerton) and some nearby settlements constituted a borough. The petition was granted and an election for mayor was called for 21 November 1887. Two candidates contested the election and Francis McParland was successful. Three days later, nine councillors were elected, with 21 candidates contested this second election. One of the successful candidates was Joseph Petrie, who was simultaneously the mayor of Greymouth. The newly elected council first met on 26 November 1887 and with that meeting, the borough came into existence. In early 1887, Grey County had committed itself to building a footbridge over the Grey River connecting Wallsend and Taylorville following a poll by its ratepayers for a NZ¬£2,500 loan. As the bridge fell into the Brunner Borough area, the borough council had the project transferred to itself. Location and services The Brunner Borough was located either side of the Grey River / MƒÅwheranui. South of the river, the land belonged to Westland. The river formed a provincial boundary until the dissolution of the provinces in 1877, with the southern side belonging to Westland and the northern side located in Nelson. Brunner, Wallsend, Dobson, and Stillwater were included within the boundaries of the borough. There were four churches within the borough (Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Roman Catholic), three state schools (in Dobson, Taylorville, and Stillwater), and a private school run by Catholic nuns.

It was one of his last and most elaborate plays.Collard and Cropp, p. 251. It was performed c. 411-407, along with The Phoenician Women which survives in full, and the lost Antiope.Collard and Cropp, pp. xiv, 254. Originally only known from a few fragments, knowledge of the play was greatly expanded with the discovery of Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 852 in 1905, and its publication by Grenfell and Hunt in 1908.Collard and Cropp, pp. 250, 255; Gantz, p. 511 with note 44. Of his lost plays, it is the one with the most extensive fragments.Collard and Cropp, p. 255. Plot The heroine of Euripides' play is Hypsipyle, the former queen of Lemnos, and lover of Jason. When the women of Lemnos killed all the men on the island, Hypsipyle had refused to kill her father Thoas, the king, and instead secretly helped him flee the island. She ruled Lemnos when Jason and the Argonauts visited the island, and she had, by Jason, twin sons Thoas and Euneus. Later, when the Lemnian women discovered Hypsipyle's deception, she fled the island, but was captured by pirates, and sold as a slave to Lycurgus, the priest of Zeus at Nemea. Hypsipyle has come to be the nursemaid of Opheltes, the infant son of Lycurgus, and his wife Eurydice.Gantz, p. 511; Collard and Cropp, p. 251; Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 759a.72-74, 79-87 (Hypsipyle's flight, capture by pirates, slavery), fr. 752h.26-28 (Lycurgus as priest of Zeus), fr. 757 (Eurydice as mother), fr. 757.41-44 (Hypsipyle as nurse). Although Lycurgus is a king in later accounts, there is no indication of that here, see Bravo III, p. 107. As the action of the play begins, Hypsipyle's twin sons by Jason, Euneus and Thoas, arrive seeking shelter for the night.Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 752c [= fr. 764 Nauck], fr. 752d. The sons have been separated from Hypsipyle since infancy, so neither recognizes the other. When Jason left Lemnos he had taken his sons to Colchis. After he died, Jason's fellow argonaut Orpheus took the boys to Thrace, where he raised them. They eventually met Hypsipyles' father Thoas, who took them back to Lemnos. From there they embarked on a search for their mother.Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 759a.93-105 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 314-315). The Seven against Thebes have also just arrived and encounter Hypsipyle. Amphiaraus tells Hypsipyle that they need water for a sacrifice, and she leads the Seven to a spring.Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 752h, fr. 753. Hypsipyle brings Opheltes with her, and somehow, in a moment of neglect, Opheltes is killed by a serpent.Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 753d, fr. 754, fr. 754a. The child's mother Eurydice is about to have Hypsipyle put to death, when Amphiaraus arrives and Hypsipyle pleads with him to speak in her defense.Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 757.37-68 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 294-297). Amphiaraus tells Euridice that the child's death was destined, proposes that funeral games be held in Opheltes' honor, and is able to convince Euridice to spare Hypsipyle's life.Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 757.69-144 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 297-303\\\\. The seer Amphiaraus describing his defense of Hypsipyle as relying \\"on piety\\", (fr. 757.73) is suggestive of the child's death having been ordained by the gods. Funeral games are held, and Hypsypyle's sons participate, as a result of which, a recognition and reunion between Hypsipyle and her sons is effected, who then manage to free Hypsipyle from her servitude.Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 759a.58-110. The surviving fragments of Euripides' play do not make it clear how the recognition between Hypsipyle and her sons was brought about, but two later accounts may have been based on the play.Collard and Cropp, pp. 253 259, tests. iv, va with notes. According to the Second Vatican Mythographer, after the sons won the foot-race, at the funeral games, their names and parents were announced, and in this way their identities were revealed.Second Vatican Mythographer 141 Bode [= Euripides Hypsipyle test. va = 164 Pepin, pp. 166-167]. The Cyzicene epigrams, the third book of the Palatine Anthology, describes a depiction, on a temple in Cyzicus, of Euneus and Thoas showing Hypsipyle a gold ornament (\\"the golden vine\\") as proof of their identities.Greek Anthology 3.10 [= Palatine Anthology 3.10 = Euripides Hypsipyle test. iv]. Compare with Euripides Hypsipyle fr. 759a.110, where Euneus mentions a \\"wine-dark grape-bunch\\".

For her loyalty to the revolutionary leader Juan Pablo Duarte and his ideals, she was deported, along with other members of her family.  Biography  Valverde was born in 1798 in Santiago de los Caballeros, but she grew up in Santo Domingo. She was the daughter of Jos√© Valverde, a lawyer for the Real Audiencia of Hispaniola, and Dolores Fern√°ndez. Her brother, Manuel Mar√≠a Valverde, shared her revolutionary political views, and he became a hero of the Restoration War, which pushed Spain off the island and re-established the country as a republic. Valverde never married or had children, dedicating herself entirely to the fight for independence. She worked manufacturing cartridges and bullets in the workshop set up at the Ravelo family home, alongside the Duarte sisters, especially Rosa; Froilana Febles; and the sisters Petronila and Altagracia Abreu y Delgado. These munitions were used in the fight for independence from Haiti in 1844 and later in the fight against Spanish annexation. After the 1844 war broke out, Valverde took up a collection among women she knew to fund repairs to the protective wall in Santo Domingo. She also worked to recruit other women to the cause of independence and incited protests. When Pedro Santana took power later in 1844, Valverde and her brother were temporarily exiled to Puerto Rico.

Life  Pool was born in London in 1913, the daughter of Gordon Desmond Pool and Agatha Eleanor Burrows. She was diagnosed with depression at an early age. In 1931 Pool won a scholarship to Somerville College, Oxford, entering in 1932 to study History. In 1934, Pool was awarded the Deakin History Essay Prize, but her mental illness prevented her from taking her degree. After leaving university, she lectured for the Workers' Educational Association (WEA) before working at Westminster Tutors, London, from 1942. She also wrote reviews for The Spectator. During the Second World War she worked for Air Raid Precautions. In 1945 she published a poetry anthology, called Poems of Death.  Art historian  In 1954, Pool studied Art History as an external student at the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London. She received a BA in 1957 with first class honours and two years later she obtained her PhD with her thesis on the literary and philosophical background to the early work of Pablo Picasso. Her supervisor was Anthony Blunt, who was also a spy for the Soviet Union. Blunt and Pool wrote a book together, Picasso: The Formative Years: a Study of his Sources (1962). In 1964 she began lecturing part-time at the University of Reading. Her book on Impressionism from 1967 became a popular success. Pool used the library of the Courtauld Institute of Art for most of her research. Her writing style was simple, but not simplistic.  Soviet spy  In January 1934 Arnold Deutsch, an NKVD agent, was sent to London. Peter Wright, the author of Spycatcher (1987), claims that Deutsch established a spy network based around the University of Oxford. This included Phoebe Pool, Jenifer Hart, Bernard Floud and Goronwy Rees. In 1963, Michael Straight faced a background check in response to an offer of government employment in Washington, D.C., and decided voluntarily to inform family friend and presidential special assistant Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. about his communist connections at Cambridge. This led directly to the exposure of Blunt as the recruiter of the Cambridge Five spy ring, who on 23 April 1964 admitted to Arthur S. Martin being a Soviet agent and named twelve other associates as spies including Phoebe Pool. Blunt told Martin that Pool had worked as his courier in the 1930s. MI5 arranged for Anita Brookner, another member of the Courtauld staff, to interview Pool. Pool confirmed Blunt's story and admitted passing messages with Hart to the Floud brothers from \\"Otto\\", identified as Arnold Deutsch. John Costello pointed out in his Mask of Treachery (1988) that \\"[t]his suggested that the Cambridge ring had spread its tentacles to Oxford.\\" Phoebe Pool committed suicide in December 1971 by throwing herself under a train.

The town site is located in the extreme southeast of Yankee Hill precinct.  History  Jamaica was established in 1885, most likely named after Jamaica, New York. The town primarily functioned as a railroad stop on a Union Pacific Railroad line that continued into nearby Lincoln. The town grew to include business such as a blacksmith, creamery, and grain elevator as well as a Baptist church. The town was located entirely in the floodplain of the nearby Salt Creek on the west bank and was particularly susceptible to flooding as it was located on a stretch of the stream which included two severe bends. Saltillo, another now-abandoned town in Nebraska, was located on the eastern bank of Salt Creek and experienced similar problems. By the 1920s, Jamaica was mostly vacant as rail traffic on the Union Pacific line decreased and Lincoln grew toward the town. The land Jamaica was previously situated on is now part of the Jamaica North Trail, named in honor of the town. The Jamaica North Trail is a public walking and biking trail which follows the path of the former Union Pacific rail line and is part of the Homestead Trail which connects downtown Lincoln, Nebraska to Marysville Kansas.

Completed and commissioned in 1942, she served in World War II, operating in the Guadalcanal campaign, New Guinea campaign, Aleutian Islands campaign, and the Marshall Islands. She finished the war as a kaiten manned suicide attack torpedo carrier, operating against Allied ships at Ulithi Atoll and in the Philippine Sea. The only submarine of her class to survive the war, she surrendered to the Allies in September 1945 after the end of the war and was scuttled by the United States Navy in 1946. Construction and commissioning I-36 was laid down on 4 December 1940 at the Yokosuka Navy Yard at Yokosuka, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 149. She was both renamed I-36 and launched on 1 November 1941. She finished her acceptance trials on 20 September 1942, and was completed and commissioned on 30 September 1942. Service history Upon commissioning, I-36 was attached to the Kure Naval District and assigned to the Kure Submarine Squadron. She moved to Agenosho Bay for work-up in the Iyo- nada in the Seto Inland Sea. With her work-up completed, she arrived at Kure on 30 November 1942. On 15 December 1942, I-36 was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in Submarine Squadron 1 in the 6th Fleet. She departed Kure at 13:00 on 18 December 1942 and proceeded to Truk, which she reached on 28 December 1942. Guadalcanal campaign Assigned to take part in submarine cargo runs to supply Japanese forces on Guadalcanal fighting in the Guadalcanal campaign, I-36 got back underway from Truk on the same day she arrived. She proceeded to the Japanese anchorage in the Shortland Islands off Shortland Island, arriving there on 31 December 1942. After the submarine arrived at Shortland after a supply run to Kamimbo Bay on the northwestern coast of Guadalcanal, I-36‚Ä≤s commanding officer and navigation officer went aboard I-31 on 1 January 1943 to receive a briefing on the naval situation in the Kamimbo Bay area and the cargo unloading procedures there. During the afternoon, I-36 loaded a cargo of 20 tons of rice in supply drums, then conducted a test dive off Shortland Island. She got underway for Guadalcanal at 18:00. A half an hour after dark on 3 January 1943, she surfaced at Kamimbo Bay, discharged her cargo into four Daihatsu-class landing craft, and headed back for Shortland Island, where she arrived at 07:39 on 5 January 1943. On 6 January 1943, I-36 departed Shortland for her second supply run at 18:00. Arriving at Kamimbo Bay after dark on 8 January, she unloaded her cargo ‚Äî 12 rubber containers of food ‚Äî into Daihatsus, embarked 39 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers, and got back underway, returning to the Shortland anchorage at 06:30 on 10 January 1943. She left the same day at 18:00 bound for Rabaul on New Britain. New Guinea campaign, January‚ÄìFebruary 1943 I-36 arrived at Rabaul on 11 January 1943 at 11:21, and that day the commander of Submarine Squadron 1 briefed her commanding officer on her next assignment, the delivery of supplies at Buna on the coast of New Guinea in support of Japanese forces fighting in the New Guinea campaign. She departed Rabaul at 12:00 on 14 January 1943 on her first supply run, arrived at the Mambare River estuary at Buna on 17 January, unloaded cargo and embarked 47 soldiers, and put back to sea, returning to Rabaul at 09:36 on 18 January 1943. She left Rabaul on her second run at 18:06 on 22 January 1943, arriving at the Mambare River on 24 January to unload 13 supply drums and bring aboard 39 soldiers, and returning to Rabaul on 27 January 1943. On her next run to New Guinea, she visited the Mambare on 30 January 1943, delivering 23 tons of supplies and evacuating 59 soldiers. I-36 remained active on the Buna run into February 1943, departing Rabaul at 11:00 on 3 February, visiting the Mambare estuary on 5 February to discharge 18 tons of supplies and embark 40 soldiers, and returning to Rabaul at 08:14 on 7 February. She then began runs to Lae, also on New Guinea‚Ä≤s coast, departing Rabaul on 14 February 1943 and delivering 45 tons of supplies at Lae after dark on 16 February, and getting back underway after embarking 90 soldiers. Early in her return voyage to Rabaul, she sighted two Allied motor torpedo boats off Lae at 01:10 on 17 February 1943 and submerged. They subjected her to a brief depth-charge attack, but she escaped unscathed and arrived at Rabaul at 10:00 on 18 February 1943. She then made her final run to Lae, leaving Rabaul at 10:00 on 20 February 1943, visiting Lae after dark on 22 February to drop off 40 tons of supplies and bring 72 soldiers aboard, and returning to Rabaul at 08:50 on 24 February 1943. Several staff officers of Submarine Squadron 1 boarded I-36 with their luggage and documents at Rabaul, and she got underway at 0900 on 25 February bound for Truk, which she visited from 27 February to 2 March 1943. Then she headed for Japan, where she arrived at Yokosuka at 07:00 on 7 March 1943. Her crew was granted four weeks of leave at the resort at Atami while I-36 underwent upkeep and repairs. Typhoon At 15:30 on 6 April 1943, I-36 departed Yokosuka bound for Truk. Her voyage had barely begun, however, when a typhoon struck while she was in the Philippine Sea. The weather prevented her from completing the recharging of her batteries, forcing her to stay surfaced while waves pummeled her. She turned back to try to find shelter from the worst of the storm in the lee of Miyake-jima in the Izu Islands. Early on the morning of 7 April 1943, a huge wave swamped her, flooding her control room and main engine room. Inspecting the damage, her crew found one bent piston rod in each of her diesel engines. I-36 turned back for Yokosuka, dumping diesel fuel along the way to gain additional buoyancy. On 8 April 1943, I-36 was east of Ch≈çshi lighthouse on Honshu when she finally was able to determine her true position for the first time since departing Yokosuka. With her starboard diesel engine repaired, she made for Yokosuka at . She reached Yokosuka on 9 April 1943 at 09:30 and subsequently began repairs at Yokosuka Navy Yard. Aleutian Islands campaign On 13 May 1943, I-36 was assigned to the Northern Unit in the 5th Fleet for service in the Aleutian Islands campaign. Before departing Japan for the Aleutian Islands, she took part in towing tests for the Unkato cargo container ‚Äî a submersible cargo container that could carry up to 377 tons of supplies, designed for a one-way trip in which the cargo‚Ä≤s recipients released, recovered, and unloaded it ‚Äî in the Seto Inland Sea on and again from 3 to 5 June 1943. She then departed Kure at 10:00 on 7 June 1943 bound for Paramushiro in the Kurile Islands, which she reached on 13 June 1943. Upon I-36‚Ä≤s arrival, her commanding officer received a briefing on the situation in the Aleutians from the commander of Submarine Squadron 1. The Americans had annihilated the Japanese garrison on Attu during the Battle of Attu of 11‚Äì30 May 1943, isolating the last remaining Japanese garrison on Kiska. Even before the fall of Attu, Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had decided on 21 May 1943 to evacuate the Kiska garrison by submarine beginning on 26 May 1943. I-36 was assigned to the effort to keep the Kiska garrison supplied while continuing the ongoing evacuation. Towing an Unkato supply container, I-36 got underway from Paramushiro at 10:00 on 15 June 1943 for her first supply run, with an estimated time of arrival at Kiska of 19 June. She soon lost the Unkato container in heavy seas, and while heading northeast at on 17 June 1943, she nearly ran aground on Middle Reef in the North Pacific Ocean south of Buldir Island. Concerned with an alarming rise in losses and near-losses of submarines in the Aleutians ‚Äî including I-36‚Ä≤s near-grounding ‚Äî the commander of Submarine Squadron 1 ordered the suspension of the Kiska supply effort on 21 June 1943, and I-36 turned back. She was in the Bering Sea north of Kiska an hour before dawn on 24 June 1943 when Submarine Squadron 1 ordered her to abandon her supply mission entirely and return to Paramushiro, which she reached on 25 June. I-36 and the submarine refueled from the oiler on 27 June 1943. I-36 departed Paramushiro on 2 July 1943 for an operating area east and north of Kiska. The Japanese completed the evacuation of Kiska on 28 July, and after an uneventful patrol, I-36 received orders on 4 August 1943 to return to Paramushiro. On 6 August, she got underway from Paramushiro and set course for Yokosuka, which she reached on 10 August 1943 to undergo an overhaul and have a radar detector installed. Hawaii reconnaissance operation On 16 August 1943, Combined Fleet Headquarters ordered I-36 to conduct a reconnaissance seaplane flight over Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, with the flight to take place on or about 20 September 1943. She embarked a Yokosuka E14Y1 (Allied reporting name \\"Glen\\") floatplane and its two-man crew and began launch and recovery tests with the plane in the Seto Inland Sea. During a launch test on 5 September 1943, one of her diesel engines broke down, and she returned to Yokosuka for repairs. I-36 departed Yokosuka on 8 September 1943 bound for Hawaii with an E14Y1 floatplane, its two-man crew, and the Combined Fleet‚Ä≤s Staff Operations Officer for Submarines embarked, the latter personally supervising the operation. She was north of Niihau, Hawaii, on 18 September 1943 when her radar detector picked up nearby radar emissions, and soon thereafter her lookouts sighted a large American patrol plane approaching. She crash-dived and avoided detection. At dawn on 20 September 1943, she was off the western tip of Niihau and surfaced several times to launch her plane, but made numerous contacts and submerged again each time. Deciding that a radar station on nearby Kauai could be detecting I-36 when she surfaced, her commanding officer and the Combined Fleet staff officer decided to move to waters southwest of the island of Hawaii, believing I-36 was likely to be detected there, and to postpone the flight until the next favorable moon phase in mid-October 1943. With I-36 southeast of Hawaii on 12 October, the two officers decided to launch the E14Y1 from a point south-southwest of Oahu after dark on 16 October 1943. Accordingly, I-36 launched the plane from that point on the evening of 16 October. The plane approached Oahu at minimum altitude to avoid detection by American radar, but was detected when it climbed over Pearl Harbor to make its observations. Several searchlights illuminated it, and it dived away to head for the recovery area at low altitude. As it crossed the coast of Oahu, its observer transmitted a single dash in Morse code, prompting I-36 to head for the recovery area at flank speed. I-36 received a garbled message from the plane indicating the sighting of four aircraft carriers, four battleships, five cruisers, and 17 destroyers in the harbor, but she never saw or heard from the plane and its two-man crew again despite searching the recovery area for five hours, flashing her running lights and an Aldis lamp, and making a number of efforts to establish radio contact with it. She transmitted a report of the reconnaissance flight‚Ä≤s results and the loss of the floatplane and its crew to 6th Fleet headquarters on 18 October 1943. I-36 was south-southwest of Hawaii on 19 October 1943 when she sighted a convoy of six U.S. Navy fleet oilers steaming southwest at and began an attack approach, but escorting destroyers forced her to go deep and lose contact. She reported the sighting on 20 October, prompting the 6th Fleet to order the submarines , , I-169, and to intercept the convoy. She also received orders on 20 October 1943 to shell the airfield on Canton Island, which she did on 1 November 1943, firing 13 rounds. She called at Kwajalein from 7 to 9 November 1943 to refuel, then arrived at Truk on 12 November 1943. New Guinea campaign, December 1943‚ÄìJanuary 1944 While at Truk during December 1943, I-36 took aboard torpedoes, distilled water, stores, and supplies from the auxiliary submarine tender . Reassigned to the Southeast Area Fleet on 18 December, she got underway on 21 December bound for Rabaul to resume her role of running supplies to New Guinea. She arrived at Rabaul on 24 December 1943, and that day aircraft of the United States Army Air Forces Fifth Air Force attacked Japanese airfields in the area. To avoid attack, I-36 submerged and waited on the harbor bottom until the American aircraft had left. On 28 December 1943, I-36 embarked on a supply run to Sarmi on the northern coast of New Guinea, where she surfaced a half hour after dark on 31 December 1943 and began to transfer her cargo into four Daihatsus. When an Allied bomber arrived in the area, she suspended the unloading of her cargo, crash-dived, and moved out to sea until the bomber departed. She then returned to Sarmi, completed unloading her cargo into the Daihatsus, and got back underway, returning to Rabaul on 2 January 1944. While she was there, a routine inspection discovered significant erosion of the tiller for her stern planes. As a result, she received orders to cancel her next supply run and return to Japan for repairs. She departed Rabaul on 5 January 1944, was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 1 on 6 January while at sea, called at Truk from 9 to 10 January, was attached directly to 6th Fleet headquarters when Submarine Squadron 1 was disbanded while she was at sea on 15 January, and arrived at Sasebo on 16 January 1944. She entered drydock there on 17 January 1944 for an overhaul, during which workers installed radar aboard her. Marshall Islands In January and February 1944, U.S. forces concluded the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, invading the Marshall Islands and capturing Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Majuro, and Eniwetok‚Ä≤s Engebi and Parry Islands. After embarking a Yokosuka E14Y1 floatplane, I-36 departed Kure on 26 March 1944 with orders to conduct an anti-shipping patrol in the Pacific Ocean east of the Marshalls and a reconnaissance of the Allied anchorage at Majuro. Alerted by Ultra intelligence information to the operations of and the submarines , , and between the Marshalls and Hawaii, United States Pacific Fleet Headquarters organized Task Group 11.1 ‚Äî a hunter-killer group consisting of the escort aircraft carrier and the destroyer escorts , , , and ‚Äî on 30 March 1944 to find and sink them. The task group‚Ä≤s first success came on 4 April 1944, when aircraft from Altamaha crippled I-45 and forced her to return to base. Around 14:00 on 14 April 1944, I-36 detected propeller noises. She later sighted Altamaha in the vicinity of and began a lengthy pursuit. She finally achieved a firing position at 18:30 on 15 April as Altamaha turned into the wind to recover aircraft, although I-36s attack set-up was spoiled when one of the destroyer escorts turned sharply toward her. I-36 fired six torpedoes at Altamaha anyway from a range of and dived to a depth of , hearing two explosions 2 minutes and 10 seconds after launch. Altamahas lookouts, meanwhile, sighted between two and four torpedo wakes to the southwest at a range of at 18:44 and Altamaha made a hard turn to starboard at flank speed to avoid them. A minute later, two torpedoes passed Altamaha off her port beam, running parallel to her new course. The task group's destroyer escorts attempted to find I-36 but did not succeed, and the encounter ended without damage to either side. At 16:55 on 22 April 1944, I-36 launched her floatplane off Majuro. Flying over the anchorage at , the plane's observer reported sighting 11 aircraft carriers and three battleships. The plane‚Ä≤s pilot could not find I-36 during the return flight, and I-36 did not locate the plane and recover its crew until dawn on 23 April 1944. To avoid detection by Allied forces, she scuttled the plane rather than spend more time on the surface recovering it, and then departed the area. She transmitted a report of the flight's findings on 23 April 1944. I-36 was on the surface when an Allied patrol plane attacked her at 21:25 on 30 April 1944. She crash-dived to . Several more aircraft arrived and dropped depth charges, creating a number of leaks aboard I-36 and causing her to assume a steep down-angle, but her crew quickly got her back under control. She escaped the planes and her crew soon repaired her damage. She arrived at Kure on 9 May 1944 and the 6th Fleet mistakenly credited her with sinking Altamaha. In May 1944 I-36, the submarines I-38, , and , and the auxiliary submarine tender began training in the Seto Inland Sea off Nasakejima for Operation Tatsumaki (\\"Tornado\\"), which called for the submarines to transport modified Type 4 Ka-Tsu amphibious tracked landing craft, each armed with two torpedoes, from Kure to Majuro. After the submarines launched the Ka-Tsu vehicles, the operation called for the vehicles to proceed to shore, move overland across the atoll's islands, then enter the water in the lagoon and attack Allied ships with torpedoes. I-36 herself carried out diving tests in the Aki-nada in the Seto Inland Sea with two Ka-Tsu vehicles embarked on 23 May 1944, after which Operation Tatsumaki was postponed pending the correction of defects found in the vehicles. The operation later was canceled entirely. June‚ÄìNovember 1944 On 19 June 1944, I-36 departed Kure on a supply run to Truk, carrying diesel fuel, torpedoes, and ammunition. She called at Truk from 30 June to 5 July 1944, where she unloaded her cargo and brought aboard 86 passengers for her return trip to Japan. She arrived at Kure on 16 July 1944. I-36 was selected on 1 September 1944 for conversion to carry kaiten manned suicide attack torpedoes. She took part in kaiten launch exercises off the kaiten base at Otsujima in Tokuyama Bay on 28 September 1944, and by October 1944 her gun had been removed to make room for fittings that allowed her to carry four kaitens on her after deck, two of them with access tubes allowing their pilots to man them while I-36 was submerged. On 7 November 1944, the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Miwa, informed the crew of plans for a kaiten attack on the United States Third Fleet anchorage at Ulithi Atoll. First kaiten mission I-36 and the submarines and formed the Kikusui (\\"Floating Chrysanthemum\\") Group, with I-36 as the group‚Ä≤s flagship. The three submarines, each armed with four kaitens and eight conventional torpedoes and with the commander of Submarine Division 15 embarked on I-36 as the group‚Ä≤s overall commander, got underway from Otsujima at 09:00, with I-36 and I-47 tasked to launch their kaiten attack at Ulithi Atoll while I-37 launched her kaitens to attack Allied shipping at Palau. On 16 November 1944, the submarines received a report from a Nakajima C6N1 Saiun (\\"Iridescent Cloud\\"; Allied reporting name \\"Myrt\\") reconnaissance aircraft which made a high- altitude flight over Ulithi Atoll and sighted four fleet aircraft carriers and three battleships as well as cruisers and destroyers in the north central part of the lagoon and transports, oilers, and other ships in the south-central part. I-36 and I-47 reached the waters off Ulithi on 19 November, and I-36 headed for her launch area at the entrance to Mugai Channel, the eastern opening to the Ulithi anchorage. I-36 surfaced north of Loosiyep Islet at 00:30 on 20 November 1944 so that the pilots of the two kaitens without underwater access tubes could man their craft. She then submerged. After 0300, the other two kaiten pilots manned their kaitens via the underwater access tubes. Her crew soon discovered that the two access-tube-equipped kaitens were wedged in their racks and could not launch, and one of the other kaitens developed a heavy leak in its pilot compartment. She launched her only other kaiten at 04:15 east-southeast of Masi Inlet; the destroyer probably rammed and sank it south of Mugai Channel at 05:38. Meanwhile, I-36 surfaced east of Falalop Islet to extricate the pilot of the leaking kaiten on her afterdeck. Immediately after I-36 brought him back aboard, two aircraft which I-36‚Ä≤s crew identified as Grumman Avengers attacked her, but she crash-dived and avoided damage. As she departed the area at full speed, she heard two heavy explosions, one at 05:45 and another at 06:05. She surfaced at 23:40 to recharge her batteries, then set course for the Philippines area, where she was ordered to conduct an anti-shipping patrol off Leyte. She transmitted a report of the results of her kaiten attack on 23 November 1944. On 23 November, a Truk-based C6N1 (\\"Myrt\\") flew over Ulithi to assess the damage resulting from the kaiten attack. It reported a large oil slick in the harbor but no change in the number of anchored vessels. On 24 November 1944, I-36 and I-47 received orders to cancel their planned patrols off Leyte and return to Japan. After a stop at Otsujima to drop off their remaining kaitens and kaiten pilots, the two submarine arrived at Kure on 30 November 1944. On 2 December 1944, over 200 staff officers and specialists convened aboard the 6th Fleet flagship Tsukushi Maru to evaluate the results of the kaiten attack on Ulithi Atoll. After examining after-action reports and post-attack reconnaissance photographs, they credited the attack with sinking three aircraft carriers and two battleships. In fact, the only ship sunk had been the fleet oiler , by a kaiten from I-47. Second kaiten mission At Kure, I-36 began preparations on 22 December 1944 for her second kaiten mission and visited Otsujima to picked up four kaitens and their pilots on 27 December. On 29 December 1944, I-36 was assigned to the Kongo (\\"Steel\\") Kaiten Group along with the submarines I-47, , , , and for an attack scheduled for dawn on 11 January 1945 on five different U.S. anchorages in widely separated locations; the date of the attack later was postponed to 12 January 1945. I-36 departed Kure on 30 December 1944 in company with I-53 and I-58, bound for her target, Ulithi Atoll. While approaching Ulithi she ran aground on a reef on 11 January 1945, but managed to free herself by blowing her main ballast tanks. On 12 January 1945, she launched her four kaitens between 03:42 and 03:57. A U.S. Navy PBM Mariner flying boat of Patrol Bombing Squadron 21 (VPB-21) dropped four depth charges on one of I-36‚Ä≤s kaitens in the lagoon and sank it. I-36 returned to Kure on 21 January 1945, and the Japanese credited her kaitens with sinking four ships, but post-World War II analysis concluded that they damaged the ammunition ship and sank the landing craft infantry . Third kaiten mission On 28 February 1945: I-36 and I-58 formed the Shimbu (\\"Divine Warriors\\") Group to attack American shipping off Iwo Jima, where the Battle of Iwo Jima had begun on 19 February 1945. I-36 departed the kaiten base at Hikari carrying four kaitens. On 6 March 1945, however, the Combined Fleet ordered the 6th Fleet to cease operations off Iwo Jima, and I-36 returned to Kure on 10 March 1945. In mid-March 1945, I-36 underwent a conversion in which her aircraft hangar and catapult were removed from her foredeck and replaced by fittings to carry two more kaitens, bringing her kaiten capacity to six. All of her kaiten racks were fitted with access tubes to allow their pilots to man them while I-36 was submerged, and a new air-search radar was installed. Fourth kaiten mission The Battle of Okinawa began on 1 April 1945 with the U.S. landings on Okinawa. On 22 April 1945, I-36 departed Hikari carrying six kaitens to patrol in the Philippine Sea between the Mariana Islands and Okinawa as part of the Tembu (\\"Heavenly Warriors\\") Group. She sighted a U.S. Navy PBM Mariner on an antisubmarine patrol off Iheya Island in darkness on 25 April 1945. Early on the morning of 27 April 1945, she sighted a 28-ship U.S. convoy of tank landing ships and medium landing ships bound from Saipan to Okinawa, at least some of which she misidentified as transports. Two of her kaitens malfunctioned, but she launched the other four. At 08:23, the high- speed transport sighted a passing torpedo wake, and at 08:25 her lookouts spotted a periscope astern of her. She dropped four depth charges at the location she had sighted the periscope, and at 08:45 witnessed a huge explosion at , followed by debris rising to the surface. The destroyer escort , escorting the same convoy, also sighted a torpedo. I-36 claimed her kaitens sank four transports, but in fact they had no success against the convoy. She returned to Hikari on 30 April 1945 and disembarked her two remaining kaitens and their pilots. I-36 was engaged in kaiten training off Otsujima on 17 May 1945 when one of her kaitens, carrying a dummy warhead, collided with a target and sank, killing its pilot. Fifth kaiten mission On 4 June 1945, I-36 put to sea to patrol in the Philippine Sea as part of the Todoroki (\\"Sound of Great Cannon\\") Group. She was on the surface in the East China Sea west of Osumi Kaikyo at on 10 June 1945 when the submarine ‚Äî which misidentified her as a \\"RO-type submarine\\" ‚Äî attacked her, firing two Mark 18 torpedoes, which both missed. On 22 June 1945, I-36 sighted the unaccompanied landing craft repair ship , which she mistook for an oiler. I-36 tried to launch two kaitens, but they both malfunctioned, so she fired four conventional torpedoes, all of which exploded prematurely. The explosions slightly damaged Endymion and I-36‚Ä≤s commanding officer thought she took on a list, but Endymion put on speed and escaped. On 28 June 1945, I-36 was north-northeast of Truk when she sighted the stores ship steaming alone from Saipan to Pearl Harbor at and launched a kaiten. Antares sighted the kaiten‚Ä≤s periscope and wake off her starboard quarter at 13:29 and turned hard to starboard, causing the kaiten to miss her astern. Her lookouts then spotted the kaiten in her wake to port, turning to the right. At 13:31, Antares opened fire on kaiten‚Ä≤s periscope and began to zigzag, and as her stern swung to starboard one of her guns hit the kaiten, which disappeared. At 13:44, Antares sighted I-36‚Ä≤s periscope, and I-36 broached. Antares opened fire on I-36 with her aft gun. Antares signaled the destroyer , which was steaming independently to the United States for overhaul, that she was under attack, and when Sproston arrived on the scene she made sonar contact with I-36 at a range of . At a range of she sighted a periscope passing from starboard to port and tried to ram the submarine without success, then dropped a full pattern of depth charges, later seeing an oil slick on the surface. She made six more depth- charge attacks without success. Meanwhile, aboard I-36, a leak began in the forward torpedo room after more than 10 depth-charge explosions, and she launched two more kaitens from a depth of . After Sproston sighted the wake of an approaching kaiten 60 degrees off her port bow, she turned hard to port, causing the kaiten to pass down her port side. Sproston then sighted a kaiten‚Ä≤s periscope off her port quarter and opened fire on it with her main battery, hitting the kaiten and triggering a large secondary explosion. Other ships then arrived to increase the overnight radar coverage of the area, and on the morning of 29 June 1945 three destroyer escorts arrived to assist in the hunt for I-36. After a thorough search of the area, all the ships departed. I-36 escaped with a damaged rudder. She was east of Guam on 29 June when her sound operator heard a distant explosion at around 10:00 and later several more explosions identified as those of depth charges. I-36 made for Japan. She was in the Bungo Strait south of Okinoshima on 9 July 1945 when the submarine attacked her, mistaking her for a Ro-60-class submarine, at . All four of Gunnel‚Ä≤s torpedoes missed astern, and I-36 arrived at Hikari later that day to disembark her remaining kaitens and their pilots, and during the afternoon continued on to Kure, where she entered drydock for repairs. End of war Undocked early on the morning of 6 August 1945, I-36 moved into the harbor at Kure and moored to a buoy. Later that morning, her crew witnessed the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. She was in the Hayase Seto Channel in Hiroshima Bay on 11 August 1945, preparing to get underway for the submarine base at Hirao to participate in the Shinshu-tai (\\"Divine Country Unit\\") kaiten mission when two Iwo Jima-based U.S. Army Air Forces P-51 Mustang fighters subjected her to a strafing attack at 10:40. The attack wounded her commanding officer and navigation officer and damaged a diesel fuel tank and a radar. Repairs were estimated to take eight days. On 15 August 1945, I-36 and I-47 were at Kure when Emperor Hirohito made his Jewel Voice Broadcast announcing the cessation of hostilities between Japan and the Allies. I-36 was the only Type B1 submarine to survive World War II. Final disposition I-36 surrendered to Allied forces in September 1945. She was inspected at Kure on 5 October 1945 and found to have a partial crew of 55, over 100 tons of diesel fuel, and 20 tons of fresh water aboard, and all of her weapons and usable equipment had been removed. She later was transferred from Kure to Sasebo and stripped of all remaining useful equipment and valuable materials. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 30 November 1945. The submarine tender eventually towed I-36 from Sasebo to an area off the Goto Islands, where on 1 April 1946 she was among 24 Japanese submarines scuttled in Operation Road's End. She was lashed to the submarine , and the two submarines were sunk together using demolition charges at 15:58 at . NotesSources * Hackett, Bob & Kingsepp, Sander.

In 2014, it was purchased by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Several preparatory studies which Hopper executed before completing the painting are held by the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. Description The painting depicts a group of young people in a small sailboat caught in the titular ocean swell. The scene's bright setting exhibits Hopper's enthusiasm for the sea, which can also be found in his other nautical paintings and seascapes ‚Äì most notably his paintings of New England lighthouses such as Lighthouse Hill (1927) and The Long Leg (1930). However, a sense of isolation pervades all of these paintings. In Ground Swell specifically, the loneliness of the boat and the rather ominous presence of a buoy signify themes of impending doom. National Gallery of Art curator Adam Greenhalgh writes that the painting possibly references the beginning of World War II, which occurred while Hopper was working on Ground Swell. Before executing Ground Swell, Hopper made a number of preparatory studies, some of which are now in the Whitney Museum of American Art. Compositionally, the sketches are the same, but Whitney museum curator Carter Foster notes that there were small variations between the sketches (e.g. cropping, level of detail) that were synthesized in the final work. Provenance In 2014, Ground Swell was purchased by the National Gallery of Art with the William A. Clark fund. The painting is part of the National Gallery's Corcoran Collection.

Telchid went on to dedicate herself to the defense and rehabilitation of Guadeloupean culture and Guadeloupean Creole. In 1984, Telchid, Poullet and Montbrand published the first Guadeloupean Creole‚ÄìFrench dictionary. She has also translated several French texts into Creole, including translations of Moli√®re and Jean de La Fontaine. She has also translated plays by the likes of Anton Chekhov and Bertolt Brecht.\\"On b√≤l a 2 lans\\". Blog Karucrea. 2007-02-11.

Biography  Born Elizabeth Silva in June 1916 in Hertfordshire, England, her father was starch manufacturer, Jack Silva of Kent. She grew passionate about birds and nature while she was still a young girl. She also had parallel interests in violin and piano and studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, but the start of World War II brought a premature end to her attendance there. As a young woman in wartime, she served with numerous other Allied female recruits in the Auxiliary Territorial Service in England and France, maintaining and driving ambulances in Europe.  Post-war life  With the end of the war, she applied for employment at the Edward Gray Institute of Field Ornithology at the University of Oxford. When her resume reached Richard Fitter, he passed it on the institute's new director, the prominent ornithologist David Lack, who was seeking a secretary. When Lack received Elizabeth's resume, Fitter had attached a note: \\"Here's another for your reject file\\", but Lack interviewed and hired Elizabeth Silva for the position, effective January 1, 1946, and then, noting her passion for birds, invited her to become a part-time field assistant, helping him perform observations in Wytham Woods, located northwest of Oxford. Common Swift (Apus apus) in flight. Elizabeth started off monitoring nests of European robins and tits in Wytham Wood as well as European swifts breeding in the tower of the Oxford University Museum. According to the museum, the tower's colony of swifts has been part of research studies since May 1948 and is \\"one of the longest continuous studies of a single bird species in the world, and has contributed much to our knowledge of the swift.\\" In 1948, Elizabeth and David announced their engagement and married on July 9, 1949, taking their honeymoon trip to the Norfolk coast. They had four children: Peter Lack (born 1952, a biologist), Andrew Lack (born 1953, also a biologist and academic), Paul Lack (born 1957, a freelance teacher), and Catherine Lack (born 1959, a university chaplain).  Research  After her marriage and changing her name to Elizabeth Lack, she continued her research, travelling to the French Pyrenees with her husband at least twice to study the birds and insects that migrated southward toward Spain, through high mountain passes. Elizabeth published several papers about their observations, which have been called \\"pioneering discoveries\\". David Lack died of cancer at age 62 in March 1973 with his final book unfinished. Elizabeth and son Peter Lack (aided by James Monk) completed the book and supervised its printing, Island Biology, Illustrated by the Landbirds of Jamaica (University of California Press, 1976). Elizabeth Lack is widely credited for her \\"prodigious amount of work\\" to produce the \\"massive and authoritative\\" A Dictionary of Birds compiled for the British Ornithologists' Union with co-editor Bruce Campbell, for which she was awarded an honorary life membership in that organization. In the preface of the tome of more than 800,000 words, Frances James, then president of the American Ornithologists' Union claims it is important for all bird lovers. \\"For students, it will serve as an entrance to the present status of the field. For scientists it will serve as a research tool and a bridge between disciplines.\\"  Later years  In Oxford, the Lacks lived in a flat in Park Town, and later on Boars Hill, just south of the city.

The trains operate in sets of two semi-permanently coupled units, formed by: four motor cabin cars (two used for conduction, and two unused in the middle of the train) named as M (for motor), two trailer cars (named as R, remolque) and a \\"trailer prime\\" (named as R'), an extra car which is not factory original to this trains, but had to be added after-hands to attend the increase in demand of the Roca Line. Overall, the Toshiba sets have seven cars, but circulation is interrupted in the middle of the set by the conduction cabins, in an M-R-M/M-R-R'-M consist. Construction began in 1984 in Japan by a company consortium leaded by Nippon Sharyo and Toshiba, with the participation of Tokyu Car, Kawasaki, Kinki Sharyo, Toshiba and Hitachi. Toshiba was in charge of the motor equipment, so the trains started being named after that company. The first 102 cars were built in the Asian nation and, in 1985, Fabricaciones Militares (Military Works) built 54 in Argentina. An extra 28 \\"trailer prime\\" cars were built by Materfer to increase the trains capacity. This model resembles the japanese trains of the time, specially the Odakyu 9000 series These were the first electric trains in Argentina to operate under 25 kV alternate current, and to use the ATS safety system. They replaced push-pull diesel trains built by Materfer in the Roca Line Ezeiza and Glew branches. Since 2016, some of the trains were replaced by newer CSR units, but an approximate 20 Toshiba trainsets still operate daily.  History  334x334px In 1973, the Argentine government ordered a study on the electrification of urban lines in the Roca Line to a group of argentine and japanese companies. In February 1979, after beating British Railways, a contract was awarded to Marubeni, Toshiba and Hitachi to start the works. The purchase of this trains also led to a transfer of technology agreement between the Japan International Cooperation Agency and Ferrocarriles Argentinos, which resulted in the creation of CENACAF (Centro Nacional de Capacitaci√≥n Ferroviaria, National Centre of Rail Training\\". The first cars arrived in Argentina on July 25, 1983, on the \\"Amanda Smiths\\" ship, and were sent to the main repair shop of the Roca Railway, the Remedios de Escalada Shops. At this time, the Roca Line was under electrification works, which also comprised the creation of a specialized shop for electric multiple units in Llavallol, where the Toshiba trains are maintained to this day. On the November 6th, 1985, a Toshiba train made the inaugural trip of the new Electric service on the Roca Line, transporting the then-president Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n between the Constituci√≥n and Avellaneda stations. The new Electric service represented a big leap forward in transport quality from the old diesel push-pull trains on the Roca Railway, and caused a spike in demand. To cope with this increased demand, an extra car (which was not included in the original japanese design) was built by Materfer in Argentina and added to each trainset. The new trailer car was named \\"trailer prime\\". This was criticized by some technicians, who claimed it undermined the train acceleration and braking. Since 2002, metal blinds were removed from the trains, in what was called a theft of State property by then- concessionaire Metropolitano, controlled by Sergio Taselli. The company claimed it was due to vandalism, so they implemented a series of reforms to make the trains \\"anti-vandalic\\". This reforms replaced the original leather coach-like seats, which also had flip-over seat backs to face the direction of travel., with fixed metal seats with no padding. The metal window frames were replaced with plastic frames. Also, seats were removed in some cars to make space for bikes and wheelchairs. From then on, the trains suffered a series of reforms which diminished their comfort. The metal seats were eventually replaced by plain plastic seats, with no comfort and fixed facing one direction. The trains were not repaired in-house by the Roca Railway, but instead sent to EMEPA, Benito Roggio Ferroindustrial and Materfer for repairs. Since the Argentine State, through Trenes Argentinos, took control of the operation again in XXX, they have been repaired primarily in the Remedios de Escalada Shops.  Technical Specifications  Toshiba EMU Pantograph The trains have a maximum speed of and feature a limiter which cuts-off the engines in case of speeding over . Energy is taking from a 25 kV alternate current overhead line using double arm pantographs. They operate on the ATS signaling system provided by Nippon Signal, which stops the train when trespassing a red signal or overreaching the maximum speed. Cars are long. Cab motor cars have a 52 tonnes weight, and trailer cars weight 51 tonnes. Motor cars are equipped by eight SE629 Toshiba 600V engines, each of them with a 300 hp power. The trains have air brakes, continuous and automatic, assisted by a Rheostatic dynamic braking system operating between 90 and 20 kilometres per hour.250x250pxThis EMUs have three double doors on each side of all cars. Doors are opened by the driver and closed by the conductor, using a panel next to the first and last doors of each car. Doors can also be closed from the cabin, if necessary. A security device blocks the train to depart a station if any doors are still open. The trains originally had Rollsigns to indicate the destination, but were upgraded to LED signs under the UGOFE administration of Roca Line.  Operation  The trains operate in the urban and suburban section of the Roca Railway since 1985, between the central station Constituci√≥n and the Glew and Ezeiza terminals in the south area of Greater Buenos Aires. Since 2015, they also operate in the Claypole branch and, since 2017, in the La Plata and Bosques branches, following the electrification of those services.  Liveries  First Metropolitano Livery Original to Mid-1990s: White body, with red and orange bands close under the windows. First, with Ferrocarriles Argentinos (Argentine Railways) logos, then same livery but FEMESA (Ferrocarriles Metropolitanos SA, Metropolitan Railways) logos. This scheme could be still be seen until about 2003. Mid-1990s - Early 2000s: After the privatization and when Metropolitano started to run the line, the paint job was changed to: White front and sides of the body, blue roof, with a large blue and green \\"M\\" letter painted. It was seen until around 2011. Latest livery Early 2000s - 2007: White front and sides of the body, blue roof, blue and green bands under the windoes. This was the second version of the Metropolitano paint job, popularly named as \\"refrigerator paint\\" and could be seen until around 2011. It was believed this new livery was implemented as a cost-cutting measure due to the economic crisis. 2008 - 2014: As the Argentine government took the line from Metropolitano due to several contract violations, the Toshiba trains started being run by UGOFE, which created a new livery: Dark blue body with silver lines, and the letters LGR painted under the cab car front door and in the lower middle side section of each car. Trains were repainted as they entered repair. It could be still seen in 2019. 2012 - 2014: A new scheme was created, similar to the UGOFE designed, but using an all-light-blue body paint. 2014 - Today: As the new CSR EMUs entered service, their paint scheme was adapted to the Toshiba trains: Light-blue body with white lines, and a dark stripe along the windows.  Incidents  In 1998, an intentional fire in the Constituci√≥n Station damaged one car. In May 2007, several Toshiba Cars were torched in the Constituci√≥n Terminal station, following big delays, and after years of poor service in the Roca Line from private operator Metropolitano. This caused a contract break between the State and the company a week after the incidents. In October 2007, an EMU derailed between the Adrogu√© and Burzaco stations, taking down several concrete poles of the railway's overhead line.

Kimball is an American historian and emeritus professor at Miami University. Among the ideas that Kimball developed was the idea of a Vietnam stab-in-the-back myth. He also argued that threats to use nuclear weapons had not been effective at advancing the United States' foreign policy goals either in the Korean War, Vietnam War, or the First Taiwan Strait Crisis. Historian Luke Nichter wrote that Kimball's books \\"shaped future works, and these volumes on my shelves stand as a reminder that my own work on the Nixon tapes would not have happened without them\\". According to historian Ken Hughes, Kimball is \\"the leading scholar of the 'decent interval'\\": the idea that Nixon eventually settled for securing a \\"decent interval\\" before South Vietnamese defeat. Hughes regrets that Kimball's work is \\"virtually unknown\\" outside academia. Nixon's Vietnam War (1998) The book argues that the Vietnam War was not winnable and \\"was waged as much against [the South Vietnamese government in] Saigon as it was against the VC/NV enemy\\". He also examines Nixon's madman theory of engaging in nuclear brinkmanship, especially between 1969 and 1972. He also argues that, in Lloyd C. Gardner's words, \\"the Nixinger case that the war had been won were it not for a last minute failure of will, has been built upon a lengthy series of \\"ifs,\\" none of which were real alternatives at the time\\". Gardner gave the book a positive review, stating that it was \\"as exhaustively researched as was possible\\", considering that not all evidence had been publicly released. The Vietnam War Files (2004) In this book, Kimball published a collection of primary source documents, mostly from the Nixon Presidential Materials Project, with an introduction written by him. The documents he chooses support the idea that Nixon pursued a \\"madman\\" course in diplomacy. He also reproduces two documents cited as evidence that Nixon and Kissinger hoped to achieve a \\"decent interval\\" between American withdrawal and the fall of South Vietnam. In his review of the book, Pierre Asselin stated that the book focused on the American perspective and did not include enough documents from foreign sources. Ken Hughes argues that Asselin's review of the book was \\"a particularly nasty academic hatchet job\\", noting that earlier Kimball published a negative review of Asselin's book. Nixon's Nuclear Specter (2015) In this book, Kimball and his co-author, William Burr, focus on the nuclear threats issued by the Nixon Administration towards the end of the Vietnam War. One challenge they faced is the lack of documentation, due to important evidence being redacted or lost. According to a review by Jonathan M. House in Michigan War Studies Review, Kimball and Burr \\"deserve praise for their discerning and cogent reconstruction of the motives and actions of the Nixon Administration in its first year\\". House finds that they made a \\"powerful argument, thanks to their masterful blending of memoir literature and historical documentation\\". Luke A. Nichter disagreed that the \\"decent interval\\" theory adequately explains Nixon Administration policies, because according to him the president's outlook went rapidly up and down depending on casualty figures and news reports. However, Nichter overall praises the book: \\"Well written and thoroughly researched, Nixon‚Äôs Nuclear Specter is a rich study for scholars of the era, and essential for those interested in Vietnam, the Nixon era, and the mindset of our 37th president.\\" Works  * ReferencesExternal links * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American historians Category:21st-century American historians Category:Miami University faculty Category:Historians of the Vietnam War ","title":"Jeffrey Kimball (historian)"},{"id":"65181595","text":"Si-Lan Chen (; 1905‚Äì1996), also known as Sylvia Si-Lan Chen Leyda, Chen Xuelan, or Chen Xilan, was a dancer, choreographer, and activist of Chinese and Afro-Caribbean descent.  Life  Si-Lan Chen was born in Trinidad in 1905 (some sources also give her birth year as 1909), the daughter of Eugene Chen, a Chinese lawyer and diplomat, and Agatha Alphosin Ganteaume, a Trinidadian woman of French Creole family. In 1912, she moved to London, where she studied dance at the Stedman Academy. In 1926, she moved to China, where her father held the position of foreign minister in the government of Sun Yat- Sen. In 1927, her family fled to Moscow after Chiang Kai-Shek took power in China. While in Moscow, Si-Lan Chen enrolled in the school of the Bolshoi Ballet and subsequently studied modern dance, including working with the avant-garde choreographer Kasyan Goleizovsky, becoming an early exponent of modern dance in the Soviet Union. She was also the first ballet teacher of her cousin, Dai Ailian, who would go on to become an influential figure in modern dance in China. She was romantically involved with the poet Langston Hughes during his visit to Moscow in 1932. In 1933, she met Jay Leyda, an American filmmaker and film historian, whom she married in 1934. During the 1930s and 1940s, following the Japanese invasion of China, she performed in benefits to raise relief funds for China, touring in the U.S., Mexico, and the Caribbean, and was an active supporter of anti-imperialist movements. During this time, she also worked in Hollywood as a choreographer and dance instructor, appearing in some films, such as The Keys to the Kingdom (1944). Due to her leftist commitments, she was monitored by the FBI and forced to frequently leave and re-enter the U.S. by the American immigration authorities, despite her marriage to a U.S. citizen. In 1984, she published an autobiography, Footnote to History. A collection of her papers is housed at the New York University libraries, including her correspondence with Langston Hughes and Pearl S. Buck, her FBI file, documentation of her dance career, and other writings.

Education  Baines attended Royal Australian Naval College from 1955 till 1958 and studied at Melbourne High School in 1959. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree with honours in Mathematics and Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 1963 and 1964, respectively, from Melbourne University. He then moved to the United Kingdom where he completed his doctorate in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics from Cambridge University in 1969, on rotating and stratified flows, and double-diffusive convection.  Career  Baines initiated his career as a Scientific Officer at Aeronautical Research Laboratories in 1964 and worked on various fluid dynamical problems. He became a Research student at Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in Cambridge University from 1966 till 1969. He was then appointed as a Research Associate at the Departments of Meteorology and Earth & Planetary Sciences in Massachusetts Institute of Technology till 1971. Baines moved back to Australia as a Queen‚Äôs Fellow in Marine Science in 1971, and joined CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Physics in 1973 as a Senior Research Scientist. He was later promoted to Principal Research Scientist in 1977 to Chief Research Scientist in 1998. In 2003, he became an Honorary Professorial/Senior Fellow at University of Melbourne, and was awarded a Leverhulme Fellowship held at Bristol University from 2004 to 2005. From 2005-2009 he participated in the QUEST programme on Climate Change in the UK, again at Bristol University. From 2003 to 2007, he was President of the ICDM - International Commission for Dynamic Meteorology (ICDM) of IAMAS - the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences. Baines is a Merle A. Tuve Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Institute of Washington and the Honorary Secretary at Royal Society of Victoria. He serves on the editorial board of the Atmosphere.  Research and work  Baines‚Äô main research focus is Geophysical Fluid Dynamics along with Climate Dynamics, incorporating Oceanography, Topographic Effects in Stratified Flows and Volcano Dynamics. His doctoral thesis included work on forced wave motion in rotating and stratified fluids, and a fundamental study of the nature of double-diffusive convection.  Stratified Fluids Baines has worked on density-stratified fluids since his doctoral studies, with application to both the atmosphere and ocean. This led to a significant number of papers describing theoretical, numerical and experimental studies of the flow of density-stratified fluids over and around topography with a variety of two- and three-dimensional shapes. Whether fluid passes over an obstacle (an isolated mountain, say) or around it depends on a variety of factors (wind profile, stratification, mountain shape), and these studies have, in particular, been helpful in improving the representation of topographic effects in weather-forecasting models. This work has included experimental studies of the flow of dense fluid downslope into density-stratified environments, which has identified a variety of differing flow regimes involving mixing, with applications to oceanic flows in particular. The impact of this work is contained within the book cited below. In a paper titled A fractal world of cloistered waves, Baines described that waves in stratified fluids in closed containers can have some strange properties, particularly if the container has sloping boundaries. Baines authored a book titled Topographic Effects in Stratified Flows in 1998, (paperback version in 1998), which utilizes both theory and practical experiments to describe the motion of homogeneous and density-stratified fluids and their flow over and around topography. It is generally regarded as the go-to book on this subject, with application to motion of both the atmosphere and ocean. In a review by Xin-she Yang from University of Leeds, the book is declared having ‚Äúgood balance of basic principles, theory, and experiment, where the comparison is made whenever possible, with a consistent attempt to provide a physical understanding of the phenomena involved.‚Äù Yang also states that ‚ÄúThis book is well organized, addressing a wide spectrum of important problems and properties of stratified flows.‚Äù N. F. Smyth writes that ‚Äúthis book represents a remarkable synthesis of a large body of work into a very readable and understandable form‚Äù. Smyth also comments in the review that the book is ‚Äúeasy to follow‚Äù and ‚Äúan excellent book‚Äù that is ‚Äúwell produced‚Äù. Don L. Boyer of Arizona State University considers the book as ‚Äúan invaluable reference for students and research workers‚Äù and congratulated Baines for ‚Äúvery fine piece of work‚Äù. Boyer also states that ‚Äúone fact that cannot escape the reader is that the author, Dr. Baines combines the mastery of the analysis involved with an outstanding facility in laboratory experiment‚Äù, which he considers ‚Äúvery rare indeed in the scientific community‚Äù. Oceanography Baines has studied oceanography along with stratified fluids, and published articles using the two research areas together. This has included a study of internal (baroclinic) ocean tides, generated by tidal flow over topography such as submarine ridges, continental shelves and slopes, submarine canyons and seamounts. In 1984, he led an observational study of the oceanic flow through Bass Strait, which involved the only measurements to date of this significant throughflow. In 1989 he published a review paper about the oceanography of Australian waters as a whole, including the ocean currents and tides in the Indian and Southern Oceans, and the coastal oceanography of southern Australia. In 1987, Baines described the relationship between ocean current transports and electric potential differences across the Tasman Sea, measured using an ocean cable, and explained the connections between them.  Climate dynamics  Baines worked on climate dynamics from 2005 till 2014 and published various research articles on topics that included the zonal structure of the Hadley circulation, and the effect of the African monsoon on the rainfall of southwest Western Australia. Baines also investigated decadal and multi-decadal variability in the context of climate change, and demonstrated that regional fluctuations in climate occur due to a variety of natural methods, as well as from artificially induced climate change. In 2007, with Chris Folland of the UK Meteorological Office, he identified and described a rapid global climate shift in the late 1960s, that is as yet unexplained. In 2010, Baines studied how climate changes affect global rainfall, and analyzed a century worth of data about the global sea surface temperature, to determine the fundamental patterns of climate fluctuations on time scales longer than ENSO, and to relate these fluctuations to probable dynamical processes. In his article titled ‚ÄòThe effect of global dynamical factors on the inter-annual variability of land-based rainfall‚Äô in 2014 with B. Henley, Baines studied the factors having major impact on rainfall in the tropics and the mid-latitudes of Australia. His research concluded that seasonal rainfall in Australia is dependent on several dynamic processes but mostly on El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. Volcano dynamics Baines took on the research topic of volcano dynamics in 2005, with a paper with RSJ Sparks on supervolcanic eruptions, and this was extended in 2008 to the effects of varying latitude on such large eruptions. In 2013 Baines, along with Selwyn Sacks, wrote an article entitled ‚ÄòAtmospheric internal waves generated by explosive volcanic eruptions‚Äô for the UK Geological Society Memoirs volume on the Soufriere Hills volcano on Montserrat. This analysis followed barometric observations of this volcano that sporadically produces Vulcanian explosions spanning several minutes. The sudden addition of thermal energy results in the production of internal waves in the troposphere. Baines studied the dynamics of intrusions into a density- stratified cross flow and showed that when a buoyant fluid from a steady source such as a volcanic eruption is released into a stratified environment such as our atmosphere, the fluid reaches an equilibrium level after which it spreads in a homogenous manner. This flow is controlled by the law of mass conservation and Bernoulli‚Äôs equation. The results from this research are applicable in the study of geological sediments.

He was forcibly separated from his people, of which only 130 individuals are left (down from 5,000 at the beginning of the 20th century), at age 9. When he was 17, he and his family migrated to the state of Paran√°, where he was alphabetised and became a printing specialist and journalist. Krenak functioned as a representative of indigenous peoples at the debates on the 1988 Brazilian Constitution, where he covered himself in ritual face painting during a speech. He either co-founded or participated in several indigenous rights organisations, such as the Uni√£o dos Povos Ind√≠genas (Union of Indigenous Peoples), the Alian√ßa dos Povos da Floresta (Alliance of Jungle- dwelling Peoples), the N√∫cleo de Cultura Ind√≠gena (Nucleus of Indigenous Culture), among others. In 2000, he appeared on TV Escola's documentary film √çndios no Brasil (Indigenous Peoples in Brazil). From 2003 to 2010, Krenak was special aide for indigenous affairs to the governor of Minas Gerais. In 2016, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, where he teaches about culture, history and traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples. Writer In later years, Krenak has been playing a distinguished role in public debate in Brazil. He has released three books as of August 2020: Ideias para adiar o fim do mundo (How to Postpone the End of the World) (2019), O amanh√£ n√£o est√° √† venda (Tomorrow Is Not for Sale) (2020) and A vida n√£o √© √∫til (Life is Hardly Useful) (2020). Philosopher According to Krenak, human beings have dissociated themselves from the earth, which is being \\"devoured\\" by corporations that embody a European concept of humanity. This humanity is immured in artificial spaces and \\"excludes a variety of sub-humanities\\" which tend to latch onto the earth. He believes that the question whether there is a single humanity should remain open; however, Krenak does not feel like he is a member of this \\"select club\\". He believes COVID-19 discriminates against humans, due to the way human societies work. \\"It does not kill birds, bears, or any other beings, just humans\\", he says. That would be a consequence of how we came to think that the earth is a 'thing' and that we are distinct from it. \\"The type of zombie humanity we are invited to be a part of does not tolerate this much pleasure [of small constellations of people who dance, sing and make it rain], so much fruition of life. So, they preach the end of the world in the hopes of making us let go of our dreams.\\" 'It is an absurd rationalisation of thought.' He pleaded for the government of Jair Bolsonaro to be internationally condemned for failing to cut back on mining in indigenous territories in the Amazon as well as in other places in which 'the ecology plays a regulating role of planetary climate.' As to permanent human agglomerations, Krenak states: \\"The idea that we can think about life based on cities has been called into question. I do not venture to say we will abandon cities. But I recognise an opportunity to re-evaluate our dependency on an old model of settlement...what we see is a host of neglected human beings, without ever being able to collect on that promise [of urban spaces that cater to a person's every need]\\" And, as regards the challenges posed by COVID-19: \\"The big investors, the billionaires, they're not the agents of change [rather, the new generations are]...whoever has sensibility doesn't have to be in a position of power to bring about change.\\" He defines spirituality as the \\"interdependence between all things living\\".

Her dismembered body was found on the evening of 7 February 1906, at 22 Rue des Hirondelles in Brussels. Her murder, now known as the Murder of Rue des Hirondelles, was never solved.  The Murder of Rue des Hirondelles  Little Jeanne's corpse was discovered on 22 Rue des Hirondelles Jeanne Van Calck lived with her grandparents but habitually visited her mother, Fran√ßoise Van Calck, for an hour or two each evening, generally accompanied by her grandfather. Her father was a typographer working for the Le Soir newspaper, who had abandoned the family and never knew his daughter. At half past 6 on the evening of 7 February 1906, Jeanne left her grandparents' home as usual, but for the first time was allowed to go alone, as her grandfather was working. She never arrived at her mother's home on the corner of Baudouin Boulevard. Around quarter to midnight, a machinist from the Th√©√¢tre de l'Alhambra, Joseph Eylenbosch, and his son discovered a suspicious package outside the door of 22 Rue des Hirondelles in Brussels (a house that was demolished in 1965). A policeman, Gustave Vandamme, was called to inspect it. He was joined by a colleague, Pierre No√´l, who helped carry the package to the police station on Place de Nouveau March√© aux Grains. The Department Chief, Desmedt, inspected the curious package and asked No√´l to open it. The first thing they saw was a blue pea coat and a checkered dress, and after taking a closer look, they found frozen blood. The still-warm corpse of a little girl, which had been dismembered and wrapped up in thick paper, tied with a hemp cord, fell to the ground. The child's legs had also been amputated. Messengers were sent to awaken the commissioner, and the public prosecutor and the press were immediately informed. When two men arrived at the police station to report Jeanne's disappearance, it was found that the clothes she had been wearing corresponded to those discovered. The next day, a huge crowd gathered in front of 22 Rue des Hirondelles. Fran√ßoise Van Calck was present, and upon hearing the news of her daughter's death, she fainted.  Investigation, funeral and popular discontent  Emile De Mot The coroner who examined the body was categorical that the murder had been carried out by somebody with specialist knowledge, probably a doctor or a butcher. The cause of death was quickly established: Jeanne had died of suffocation from violent vomiting after being forced to drink a large quantity of alcohol, in addition to violent abuse. The time of death was fixed between 8 and 9 in the evening. The funeral was held on 11 February, with over ten thousand people in attendance. The burgomaster, Emile De Mot, presided over the collection of the body from Saint-Pierre Hospital's mortuary and accompanied the funeral cortege. The police guarded the coffin, while the crowd shouted in anger. Jeanne was taken to the Brussels Cemetery in Evere, where she was buried and remains to this day. The police began searching for the little girl's killer, sifting through the canals to find her legs, which were still missing. On 16 February, a gardener by the name of Buelens found two packages about 40 cm in length in the park of the royal Stuyvenbergh farm. The day before, Jeanne's boots had been found close by. The Belgian government offered a reward of 20,000 Belgian francs to anyone who could identify the murderer, and even offered leniency with regard to any person indirectly involved who incriminated themselves.Le Petit Parisien, 18 February 1906. A police dog, Folette, and her handler, Agent Librechts, were dispatched to the crime scene. The dog stopped at 22 Rue des Hirondelles, then another house and barked at length in front of the grandparents' house. Later, a Spaniard and an Algerian were remanded in custody, but both were released without charge. Jean Many, a butcher's apprentice who begged in the streets, was similarly arrested but released. Some time later, a bloody shirt was found on Chauss√©e de Wavre. A Dr Nyssens was considered a person of interest, but no convincing leads were uncovered.Le Petit Parisien, 14 February 1906. The Stuyvenbergh farm around 1900 The newspapers of the time criticised the carelessness and incompetence of the authorities, who never managed to solve the crime. A Parisian lawyer, Louis Frank, gained access to the files and listed 29 failures in the investigation, publishing his findings in 1909. Some leads had never been followed up, because they came from a little girl. She reported seeing her friend around 7 p.m. on the night of her murder near her grandparents' house, accompanied by a man she seemed to trust, but heading in the opposite direction from her mother's home. √âmile Rossel, the owner of Le Soir at the time, opened a subscription service to fund a white marble monument in homage to the \\"Little Angel of Rue des Hirondelles\\". The following year, another child, Annette Bellot, was found dead in Anderlecht, under similar circumstances. Her killer, like Jeanne's, was never found.

He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Guelph before travelling to the United States to earn his Master's degree from the University of Southern California. He returned to Canada at the turn of the century to receive his PhD from the University of British Columbia. Career In his lab, Venditti is using a flume channel to investigate flow resistance in rivers and learn more about potential flooding impacts. Upon completing his PhD, Venditti accepted a senior scientist position at an environmental consulting company in Berkeley, California. He stayed there for two years before joining the faculty at Simon Fraser University (SFU) as an assistant professor. During his tenure at SFU, Venditti studied the characteristics of the Fraser River, including flow resistance and the relationship between river beds and river flows. In order to research this, he constructed a flume to recreate the river channel within his Environmental Fluid and Sediment Dynamics Lab. By 2014, Venditti led a group of researchers from SFU, the University of Ottawa, and the University of British Columbia along the Fraser River to study river flow in bedrock canyons. Their research, which was documented in the journal Nature, disproved previous conceptions of flow and incision in bedrock-rivers. Two years later, he collaborated on the third Icy Bay expedition in southeast Alaska to map the submarine deposits. He was part of a group of researches studying how the 2015 Megatsunami reshaped the landscape at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier. As SFU's director of environmental science, Venditti and his research team were granted funds to purchase a Terrestrial Laser Scanner to be used in advanced research projects on geophysical hazard mitigation and infrastructure resiliency. He also oversaw the establishment of SFU's new School of Environmental Science. In 2020, he received one of SFU's Excellence in Research Awards alongside physical anthropologist Hugo Cardoso.

It is housed in the historic Hokitika Carnegie Library building. Exhibitions include information about the gold rush and the unique West Coast stone pounamu (greenstone) and its value to MƒÅori. The museum also holds a significant photographic collection. Seismic strengthening requirements closed the museum in 2016, with an estimated opening date of late 2020 to mid 2021.  Origins  1973 museum building Hokitika's population had rapidly increased in the 1860s due to the West Coast gold rush, so it was seen as fitting for it to have a museum. It started in two 'Museum Rooms' in the 1869 Hokitika Town Hall building, which was operated from at least 1877 by the Westland Institute. The Museum Room was requisitioned by the Hokitika Borough Council in 1946. In 1952 a museum committee was established, led by Bob Drummond, to find a dedicated space to house the museum. The \\"Hokitika Pioneer Museum\\" opened in 1960, consisting of one room in the 1908 Hokitika Carnegie Library. Donations to the new museum room were so enthusiastic that what had begun a planned extension became a plan for a new building. Fundraising began in 1964 for a museum building to be built behind the Carnegie Library, and the equivalent of $450,000 in 2013 dollars was raised by public subscriptions, service clubs, and a grant from the Department of Internal Affairs. The West Coast Historical Museum opened in the new building on 20 December 1973, the anniversary of Hokitika's founding in 1864. The speaker was Roger Duff, director of Canterbury Museum. The building had an entrance on Tancred Street with two display halls separated by a courtyard arboretum. It was open seven days and had a 30c entrance fee. A posthumous gift of books by William Heinz in 1977 established the core of a research centre.  Carnegie Building  By the time the new museum building was completed, the Carnegie Library was nearly derelict, and not part of the new museum. After being empty for 20 years it was restored in the 1990s, through the efforts of Carnegie Building Restoration Committee and Heritage Hokitika. The restoration cost $600,000, and involved internal bracing and replacement of the parapets and roof pagoda with plastered-over plastic for earthquake safety. The Museum was able to move back into what was now known as the Carnegie Building in 1998, with one of the 1973 galleries becoming collections storage and the museum entrance moved to Hamilton Street. The building housed a public Carnegie Gallery for community art exhibitions, as well an i-Site information centre. In 2010 the museum revived its original name, becoming the Hokitika Museum once more. 1998 plaque In September 2016 a seismic assessment of the Carnegie Building found it was at only 12 per cent of the new required building standard (NBS). The restoration in the 1990s had brought it up to 50 per cent of the 1991 Building Act standard, but those standards were revised following the 2010‚Äì2011 Christchurch earthquakes. The report was reviewed, and the building reassessed at perhaps 28 per cent of the NBS, but still short of the minimum standard of 34 per cent. The Carnegie building was declared earthquake-prone and closed under section 124 of the Building Act. Staff were rehoused in Drummond Hall, the name for the 1973 storage area, and the Museum Research Facility at 17 Revell Street. The council unanimously decided to upgrade the building at a cost of $500,000 The loss of retail sales and admission charges was estimated to cost $52,000 per year; $47,000 in 2017. Just before its closure for earthquake strengthening the museum had 17,000 visitors a year. The Carnegie Building continued to be staffed temporarily with limited displays and community exhibitions, but although the museum was planned to reopen sometime between the end of 2020 and mid-2021, earthquake strengthening had not yet begun as of September 2020. Heritage registration On 11 December 2003, the Carnegie Building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (since renamed Heritage New Zealand) as a Category II structure, with registration number 1702. The reasons given were its historical significance as a gift from Andrew Carnegie, the quality and grandeur of the design which highlighted the importance of the town, its high esteem in the community as expressed by the significant effort to restore and keep it, and its scale which made it one of the town's landmark buildings; it has been described as the \\"most-photographed building in Hokitika\\". It is listed as an historic place in the Westland District Plan.  Staff  When the new museum building opened in 1973 it had for the first time a full-time paid director, who answered to a management committee with representatives from Westland County Council and Westland Borough Council; these merged in 1989 to become Westland District Council. In 2016, the museum employed 10 staff (equivalent of four full time positions), with Julia Bradshaw as director. After eight years, Bradshaw left in March 2017 to become Senior Curator of Human History at Canterbury Museum. Commercial tourism operator Destination Westland took over management of the museum and i-Site in July 2018, and in November 2018 appointed M√°ire Hearty as museum services manager and Judith Taylor as director ‚Äì both part-time positions ‚Äì filling an 18-month vacancy. Both positions were then axed by Destination Westland less than a year later in June 2019. In September 2020 the Westland District Council announced it would take over management of the museum from Destination Westland, along with its $266,000 budget. After much debate the Council resolved to purchase a nearby building at 11 Weld Street and combine the museum with the Westland District Library as the Westland Discovery Centre / Pakiwaitara.  Collections  The museum's collection is largely historical objects relating to Westland District, as well a large photographic archive. It is worth an estimated $2 million. Only about 5% was catalogued as of June 2019. * On display is a 1957 Meccano model of a gold dredge built by local Blake Huffam * New Zealand's oldest working television, built from a kitset in 1958  References  External links  * Hokitika Museum website * Museums Aotearoa listing Category:1900s architecture in New Zealand Museum Category:NZHPT Category II listings in the West Coast, New Zealand Category:Museums in the West Coast, New Zealand Category:Tourist attractions in the West Coast, New Zealand Category:Carnegie libraries in New Zealand ","title":"Hokitika Museum"},{"id":"65181998","text":"Ardzhidada () is a rural locality (a selo) in Kumtorkalinsky District, Republic of Dagestan, Russia.

Beginning in the 1960s, Cambridge worked as a journalist, including as a reporter and as women's page editor of the Guiana Graphic, which later became the Guyana Chronicle. She also appeared on the radio for the BBC. Cambridge met her husband, the American actor, writer, and civil rights activist Julian Mayfield, when they were both working at the Guyanese Ministry of Information and Culture. They married in 1973, and a few years later the couple left Guyana and moved to Washington, D.C., spending time in Germany as well. Mayfield died in 1984, in Washington. Cambridge returned to Guyana after his death, moving to the remote Yukuriba Falls in the Upper Demerara-Berbice region. While Cambridge had worked on a novel in collaboration with her husband, titled Murder on the East Bank, it was never published. She also wrote an unpublished autobiographical novel, Show Me the Way to Stay Home. Her first novel, Clarise Cumberbatch Want to Go Home, was published in 1987. It was written in a modified version of Guyanese Creole. It is about a Guyanese immigrant woman who comes to New York in search of her husband, who faces difficulties fitting in with both Americans and Guyanese expatriates. It is considered a representative work of Guyanese literature, part of a new wave of Guyanese women writers at the time. Cambridge's work has also been featured in Margaret Busby's 1992 anthology Daughters of Africa. During her years living in the United States, Cambridge became involved in the Black literary scene, counting Maya Angelou among her social circle. Though she now lives in the Guyanese interior, she has continued to travel to and work in the United States, particularly New York and Washington. In 2000, she participated in the Summer Institute fellows conference and D.C. Area Writing Project in Washington, D.C., and she has been involved with the Guyana Cultural Association of New York, including performing a reading at their symposium at Columbia University in 2004. Cambridge continues to be involved in activism in her country and internationally, including advocating in defense of her native language Guyanese Creole and offering 100 acres of her land to resettle Haitians displaced by the 2010 earthquake.

Originally from Denton, he now lives in Austin. Wiebe is the lead singer of several nationally known Austin-based bands including Drakulas, High Tension Wires, and his most longstanding group, Riverboat Gamblers, with whom he has released six albums since 1997. Since 2013, his work has also turned increasingly toward comedy, including two works released by Grammy-winning comedy label Stand Up! Records. Career=Music Wiebe is known for a high-energy performance style which has led to frequent accidental self-injury, which, in turn, has fed back into his iconic status in Texas punk rock. He suffered a collapsed lung after a crowd-surfing accident in 2016. He once accidentally broke a gas main while swinging from the rafters of a club in Denton, Texas, filling the room with flammable gas. Stand-up comedy Wiebe began performing stand-up in 2011. In both his music and comedy, Wiebe is given to outlandish theatrics and characters. With comic Avery Moore, Wiebe created a pair of satirical Southern youth group ministers, Dottie and Jefferson- Montclaire McCuewan. Wiebe's character as lead singer of Drakulas, Savage Lord Mic, parodies the postapocalyptic style of 1970s movies like The Warriors. Wiebe performs on the 2013 Altercation Punk Comedy Tour compilation Hostile Corporate Takeover, produced by Stand Up! Records. Since 2019, Wiebe has hosted the podcast Contrarian Court with novelist Wayne Gladstone, in which a different unusual opinion such as \\"bathrobes are stupid\\" is argued for by each week's guest, with Gladstone and Wiebe acting as opposing counsel and judge. In 2019, he released the single \\"I Can't Die,\\" an instrumental \\"theme song\\" for fellow Austin comic Ryan Cownie's Stand Up! Records album I Can't Die.

Therefore, Nixon could avoid becoming the first United States president to lose a war. A variety of evidence from the Nixon tapes and from transcripts of meetings with foreign leaders is cited to support this theory, including Henry Kissinger's statement before the 1973 Paris Peace Accords that \\"our terms will eventually destroy him\\" (referring to South Vietnamese president Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu). However, both Kissinger and Nixon denied that such a strategy existed. Background Already by late 1970 or early 1971, President Richard Nixon and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger \\"effectively abandoned the hope of a military victory\\" in the Vietnam War. Increasingly, they questioned the premise that the South Vietnamese Army would ever be able to defend its country without American help, especially after the Lam Son 719 debacle. Following the Paris Peace Accords, the Nixon administration claimed that \\"peace with honor\\" had been achieved and that South Vietnamese independence had been guaranteed. After the Fall of Saigon, Nixon and Kissinger blamed the failure of the accords on the United States Congress refusing to continue support to South Vietnam‚Äîin other words, the Vietnam stab-in-the-back myth. Publicly, Nixon stated that his goal from the peace accords was for North Vietnam to recognize South Vietnam's right to choose a leader by democratic election. The decent interval theory holds that, privately, the Nixon administration did not plan for the continuation of South Vietnam and was only interested in the release of United States prisoners of war and maintaining a \\"decent interval\\" before South Vietnamese collapse. If a \\"decent interval\\" elapsed between the withdrawal of American troops and the fall of the South Vietnamese government, Nixon could avoid the blame of being the first American president to lose a war. The idea of a decent interval was absent from public debate during the Nixon years and originally advanced in a 1977 book of the same name by former CIA analyst Frank Snepp. However Snepp does not subscribe to the full theory of intentional abandonment of South Vietnam, but rather that Kissinger, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Graham Martin and others engaged in the same kinds of self-deluded thinking after the Paris accords that had gotten the US into Vietnam in the first place. What Snepp was most outraged over was the haste with which the Americans pulled out in April 1975, abandoning many key South Vietnamese allies and intelligence assets to their fates. Snepp was not party to the high-level negotiations in which the \\"decent interval\\" strategy occurred. Evidence Historian Ken Hughes wrote, \\"The proof that Nixon and Kissinger timed military withdrawal to the 1972 election and negotiated a ‚Äúdecent interval‚Äù comes from extraordinarily rich and undeniable sources‚Äîthe Nixon tapes and the near-verbatim transcripts that NSC aides made of negotiations with foreign leaders.\\" This is despite \\"the normal human reluctance to produce self-incriminating evidence\\", which according to Hughes explains why more details about the strategy are not known. The first sign of the strategy appears in the Nixon tapes on 18 February 1971, Kissinger stated that after a peace agreement was concluded, \\"What we can then tell the South Vietnamese‚Äîthey‚Äôve got a year without war to build up.\\" According to Hughes, the statement indicates that Kissinger already realized that peace would not last. On 19 March, Kissinger stated that \\"We can‚Äôt have it knocked over‚Äîbrutally‚Äîto put it brutally‚Äîbefore the election\\", justifying timing the withdrawal of troops to the 1972 American presidential election. Nixon was also privately skeptical of the Vietnamization program, which he officially stated was \\"a plan in which we will withdraw all of our forces from Vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our program, as the South Vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom\\". Hughes writes that Nixon's statements on Vietnamization are unambiguously false and the program to be a \\"fraud\\". In his first secret meeting with Zhou Enlai in 1971, Kissinger explained that the United States wanted a full withdrawal, the return of all POWs, and a ceasefire for \\"18 months or some period.\\" Kissinger noted that \\"If the government is as unpopular as you seem to think, then the quicker our forces are withdrawn, the quicker it will be overthrown. And if it is overthrown after we withdraw, we will not intervene.\\" In later meetings, Kissinger used the words \\"reasonable interval\\", a \\"sufficient interval\\", and a \\"time interval\\" to refer to the time that would have to pass after United States withdrawal before the aggression against South Vietnam would result in a forceful reaction from the United States. Nixon and Kissinger tape of 3 August 1972, discussing the decent interval Nixon's and Kissinger's conversation on 6 October 1972 In discussions with Chinese and Soviet leaders, Kissinger stated that the United States would not intervene if more than eighteen months passed since a settlement. A crucial point in the negotiations occurred after the North conceded in its demand for South Vietnamese President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu's resignation; according to American intelligence, the South Vietnamese government would quickly unravel without him. On 3 August 1972, Nixon stated, \\"I think we could take, in my view, almost anything, frankly, that we can force on Thieu. South Vietnam probably can never even survive anyway.\\" Kissinger replied: \\"We‚Äôve got to find some formula that holds the thing together a year or two.\\" Two days before the Paris Peace Accords were signed according to chief North Vietnamese negotiator L√™ ƒê·ª©c Th·ªç's proposal (8 October 1972), Kissinger told Nixon twice that the terms would probably destroy South Vietnam: \\"I also think that Thieu is right, that our terms will eventually destroy him.\\" Proponents Historian Jeffrey Kimball supports the decent interval theory and promoted it in various books, including The Vietnam War Files (2004) and Nixon's Nuclear Specter (2015). Kimball argued that Nixon Administration adopted the decent interval strategy in the second half of Nixon's first term. According to Hughes, Kimball is \\"the leading scholar of the 'decent interval'\\". In his book Henry Kissinger and the American Century, Jeremi Suri wrote: \\"By 1971 [Kissinger] and Nixon would accept a 'decent interval' between U.S. disengagement and a North Vietnamese takeover in the south. Secret talks with Hanoi would allow Kissinger to manage this process, preserving the image of American strength and credibility.\\" In a 2003 paper, Finnish historian Jussi Hanhim√§ki argued that Hughes is very critical of the decent interval strategy: According to Japanese historian Tega Yusuke, writing in 2012, decent interval \\"is becoming the standard explanation\\" because South Vietnam in fact collapsed in 1975. Opponents Kissinger and Nixon both denied that they had used a \\"decent interval\\" strategy. Kissinger wrote, \\"Nor is it correct that all we sought was a 'decent interval' before a final collapse of Saigon. All of us who negotiated the agreement of October 12 were convinced that we had vindicated the anguish of a decade not by a 'decent interval' but by a decent settlement.\\" However, both had a vested interest in keeping the \\"decent interval\\" secret. Based on newly declassified documents, in 2001 Larry Berman wrote a book, No Peace, No Honor in which he argued that Nixon actually planned for a permanent war in Vietnam, rather than a decent interval before defeat. Mixed Luke Nichter, a historian who studied the Nixon tapes, has argued that, before Nixon's visit to China in early 1972, the decent interval theory did not explain the fluctuating attitude of Nixon and Kissinger to the war, which had sharp ups and downs depending on casualty figures and news reports. Nichter writes, \\"at times they speak of desiring no interval at all other than the duration necessary to quickly withdraw troops and POWs\\". After the China visit, \\"the tenor and content of their discussions seems much closer to support for the idea of a decent interval theory\\". In his book The Nixon Tapes, Nichter and his coauthor write opposing \\"scholars [who] argue that Nixon and Kissinger‚Äôs strategy in Vietnam was never more than securing a ‚Äòdecent interval'\\". However, Hughes considers this to be a misrepresentation because he does not know of any scholars who argue that decent interval characterized the administration's strategy throughout. Johannes Kadura argues that Nixon and Kissinger \\"simultaneously maintained a Plan A of further supporting Saigon and a Plan B of shielding Washington should their maneuvers prove futile.\\" According to Kadura, the \\"decent interval\\" concept has been \\"largely misrepresented,\\" in that Nixon and Kissinger \\"sought to gain time, make the North turn inward, and create a perpetual equilibrium\\" rather than acquiescing in the collapse of South Vietnam.

Its current primate is Metropolitan Athenagoras of Mexico.  History  Following the retirement of Archbishop Iakovos (Coucouzis) of America, Ecumenical Bartholomew I of Constantinople determined that the Church in the Western Hemisphere would be better served, if the then Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America were to be re-structured into separate jurisdictions. Subsequently in July of 1996, a new Metropolis for Central America and the Islands of the Caribbean was established, to which Metropolitan Athenagoras was elected. The Metropolis covers a vast region, including Mexico, all the Countries of Central America, two Countries of South America, Colombia and Venezuela and all the Island Countries of the Caribbean, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Since the Holy Metropolis of Mexico is under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, thus functioning separately and apart from the Archdiocese of America, nevertheless our Metropolis reflects and considers itself a daughter Church of the Church of America, which nurtured the region of Central and South America throughout most of the previous century. Finally, as the Holy Orthodox Metropolis of Mexico for the aforementioned Countries, we are the only legal and legitimate entity for this vast region, representing the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Greek Orthodox Church.

Early life and marriage  Born on the Victorian goldfields at Durban Lead, Ballarat, Victoria, James was the eldest child of Ebenezer James and Clara Elizabeth James (n√©e Maisey). The family moved to Port Melbourne where James assisted her father in his work as chaplain at the Mission to Seaman. James married her cousin, George Henry James on 25 May 1889 at her parents' home in Port Melbourne. He was a schoolteacher with the Victorian Department of Education.  War and welfare work  Both her sons enlisted in World War I and were injured. James travelled to England to assist their recovery. Subsequently, they enlisted in the Flying Corps and, rather than returning to Australia, she volunteered with the Red Cross. She was later put in charge of a unit of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps in France. After the war she formed the Ex-Service Woman's Association and was its president for a number of years. In 1922 she was president of both the Metropolitan branch of the Farmers' Union and the Wattle League. She was also a leading member of the Victorian Women Citizens' Movement and the Victorian branch of the National Council of Women. James stood unsuccessfully for election to the Council of South Melbourne in 1927. In 1934 James called a meeting at the Lyceum Club in March 1934 at which she proposed the formation of a Centenary Club, being a place to welcome visitors to Melbourne. In the 1938 Birthday Honours, James was made an Officer of the Order of British Empire for \\"social welfare services in the State of Victoria\\".  Personal  James died at Kareela Private Hospital, Auburn, Victoria on 6 November 1943. She was survived by her two sons, Cecil Holman James and George Ronald James. Her husband had predeceased her in September 1938. She is buried in Springvale Cemetery, Springvale, Victoria.

Located in Midtown Atlanta, the development is currently expected to consist of a large residential high-rise, called No. 2 Opus Place, and possibly a smaller tower. Upon its completion, No. 2 Opus Place would be among the tallest buildings in Atlanta and the tallest residential building in the city. The project was first developed in 2014, but underwent a significant alteration in 2016.  History  In February 2014, a group of New York City- based developers proposed a large construction project in Midtown Atlanta that would consist of three skyscrapers across from the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta, on what had formerly been the site for the proposed Atlanta Symphony Center. An attorney for the developers said Bernardo Fort Brescia and his architectural firm Arquitectonica would serve as designers for the project, which would include 1,300 residential units, of retail space, and over 300 hotel rooms. In May 2014, the site was purchased from the Woodruff Arts Center for a reported $22 million. At this time, the project was known as 98 14th Street, and it was expected to be constructed in phases and completed by 2020. The tallest of the three skyscrapers would be , just shorter than the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, making it the sixth-tallest building in the city. In July 2016, Olympia Heights Management (OHM, which had been one of the original developers for the project) and architectural firm Perkins and Will presented radically altered plans for the site. As now envisioned, the project would consist of two skyscrapers, the larger of which would be , making it the second-tallest skyscraper in the city. The first phase would see the creation of this taller skyscraper, with an expected completion some time in 2019. The developers at this time announced that construction would begin by the end of the year. In October 2016, permits were filed for construction to begin at the site, with construction costs for the first tower estimated at over $300 million. The next month, the project was renamed Opus Place, with the first tower called No. 2 Opus Place. In early 2017, the overall height of the tower was reduced from 74 to 53 stories after a hotel pulled out of the project. Even with the height reduction, the building would still have been the tallest residential building in the city, topping out at . In March 2017, developers announced that construction would start in October that year, with architect Richard Meier creating the building's master plan. Prices for residences in the building were announced at being between $700,000 and $12 million, with prices averaging around $1.6 million. While initially scheduled for October, the development held its official groundbreaking ceremony on December 14, 2017. By April 2018, the building had sold nearly 20% of its available residences. Sales gallery for No. 2 Opus Place (2020) In May 2018, developers projected that, following grading and excavation at the site, construction of the tower itself would \\"start full force\\" by September or October of that year, with completion by mid-2020. However, by October, construction was projected to start in early 2019, with completion in early 2021. That same month, developers announced a change in plans that would see of office space occupying the bottom 17 floors of the building. In August 2019, developers again altered the construction schedule, claiming that construction would commence in November of that year, top out in January 2022, and open that October. In January 2020, OHM announced that they would be selling about of the land surrounding No. 2 Opus Place with the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield, leading to further questions regarding the future of the project.

An Introduction\\", S√ºdosteuropa 67, 3 (2019): 297-303, doi: https://doi.org/10.1515/soeu-2019-0023 Not all former political borders are today phantom borders. Factors that may increase the likelihood of a political border becoming a phantom border upon dissolution, include: short time elapsed since the border's dissolution, long existence of the former border, imporousity of the former border, and divergent characteristics of the political entity formerly governing one side of the border. Phantom borders have many different implications: in Ukraine they are associated with conflict, while in countries such as Romania they play an important part in relations with neighboring countries.Ja≈Ñczak, Jaroslaw. \\"Phantom borders and electoral behaviour in Poland.\\", Erdkunde 69, 2 (2015): 125-137, doi: https://doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.2015.02.03 Development of the concept Though the phenomenon of phantom borders is ancient, articulation of the concept is recent, stemming from its identification in the project (also known as the Phantom Borders in East Central Europe Project, a now-defunct European border studies research network backed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research), which defines the phenomenon as \\"former, predominantly political borders that structure today‚Äôs world (‚Ä¶), historical spaces [that] persist or re-emerge‚Äù.Phantomgrenzen Project. Phantomgrenzen English Flyer (PDF). Retrieved 5 September 2020. Recent developments in border studies have led to borders being understood more under the lens of being social constructs (such as in the work of Vladimir Kolosov).Kolosov, Vladimir & Wiƒôckowski, Marek. \\"Border changes in Central and Eastern Europe: An Introduction\\". Geographia Polonica 91, 5-16 (2018): 5-16, doi: https://doi.org/10.7163/GPol.0106. From the modern perspective, phantom borders are marks of the past and reminders of previous conquests and annexations. Nail Alkan states that this \\"enclosure fosters a feeling of security and people prefer to live in familiar circumstances\\" where old political borders were. Notable phantom borders=Germany The borders of Prussia and East Germany are reflected in support for far-right or national conservative parties after German unification, including DNVP in the Weimar Republic and AfD in the 21st century. East Germany notably did not receive as much immigration, except Russians, during the Cold War, so East Germans, particularly Russian-Germans, post-unification are more opposed to it. Combined with East German Ostalgie and the perception by East Germans of being second-class citizens compared to West Germans, eastern regions of Germany tend to vote more for either left-wing parties like The Left and PDS or right- wing anti-immigration parties like AfD. Other consequences of the German East- West divide show themselves in different ways - In the west, workers earn higher wages and produce more, while unemployment is higher in the east. The divide is also reflected in personal preferences - in terms of car preferences, West Germans prefer BMW over ≈†koda, while the opposite is the case in the East.

Blue represents majority-Protestant regions, green represents majority-Catholic regions, and red represents majority-irreligious regions. Poland Historically, Poland was partitioned multiple times between the German Empire/Prussia, the Habsburg Empire, and the Russian Empire. Under Prussian control were the Polish regions of eastern Pomorze, Wielkopolska and Upper Silesia, regions historically exposed to German influence. Russia controlled central Poland under Congress Poland, including the capital, Warsaw, and Austria controlled the southern regions under the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Both regions had large, mostly dominant populations of Polish people. At the end of the Second World War, German territories up to the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line were handed over to Poland as compensation for the annexation of eastern Poland by the Soviet Union. Politically, this led to the creation of phantom borders. Coinciding with the Prussian-controlled regions, western Poland is known as Polska liberalna, or \\"liberal Poland\\", due to their opting to vote for liberal or social-democratic parties such as PO in elections. In central and southern Poland, the situation is different: the region is known as Polska solidarna, or \\"solidarity Poland\\", where voters vote more to the conservative side, represented by parties such as PiS. This split can be explained through the influences foreign empires had on the Polish people, such as the ones caused by Germanization and Russification programs and different languages, economic models, political traditions, and cultures within these different empires, which affect the industrialization and infrastructure density of regions, re- settlement of the population of Eastern Poland up to the Oder-Neisse line, and social norms and values.

Transylvania, in general, has more ethnic diversity than other parts of Romania, with a significant Hungarian minority and a smaller German one. Perceptions of political and social powers are also different, as Transylvania was ruled under administrative authorities while the former Ottoman lands were under more arbitrary rule with less centralization of legal powers. Transylvania experiences a larger number of political protests than the rest of the country excluding the capital Bucharest. Formerly Ottoman Romania had been struggling for full independence, while Habsburg Romanians tended to go for political reforms. The faultline, separated by the Carpathian Mountains, is sometimes considered as the line separating the Orthodox Church in the east and the Latin Church to the west. Throughout the 1970s, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu implemented policies to assimilate minorities in Transylvania, though the cultural divide still remained. During Romania's elections in the 1990s, Transylvanian residents were less supportive of nationalic and populistic parties. In 1996, liberal presidential candidate Emil Constantinescu won in nearly all of Transylvania, while incumbent and former communist politician Ion Iliescu won in nearly all regions outside it.

Ari means Chandra and mala means child. Due to a curse, the size of Chandra started reducing. After losing everything when Chandra came to this place, which was found with many umber of vilva trees, the deity of this place took and put the Chandra on his head. Then he got rid of the curse. Later he requested the deity that this place be called as Arimalam and so this place got the name. There is also another opinion that 'Arumpallam' became Arimalam in due course. In the shrine of Vilangiamman many number of Eralinji fruits were found and so this place was called as Arimalam. ‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ≥‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡ØÄ‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø ‡Æö‡ØÅ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ∞‡Øá‡Æ∏‡Øç‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æï‡Øã‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Øã‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç, ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ©‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æï‡Øã‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç Presiding deity The presiding deity of the temple is known as Sundaresvarar and the goddess is known as Meenakshi.

She was dubbed as Selang Bagsik (Fierce Sela) for her bravery. Personal life Marcelo was born in 1869 at Malibay, Pasay. She belongs to an upper class family that owns an areca nut farm. She married Quirico Lugo, a man from Aguho, Pateros, and bore him a son. A Woman in Revolution One day, Marcelo's husband was arrested by Spanish civil guards. He quietly watched as his husband was taken away, without wailing nor protesting. Marcelo's husband was a member of the Katipunan and was therefore seized. It was believed that right after his capture, she entrusted his son to her sister and sought revolutionaries to attack the Spaniards on their trenches. The Spaniards, however, successfully killed his husband. Since then, Marcelo had been active in the Katipunan as a general, leading revolt. It was rare and unexpected for a woman, but as opponents saw her fight, she was hailed as Selang Bagsik. Marcelo gathered and trained young members of the Katipunan ranging from 14‚Äì18 years old. She also managed and organized the nursing of wounded Katipunan members in Bulacan. Death In 1897, Marcelo died at the Battle of Pasong Santol in Dasmari√±as. She led a troop to rush towards the center of the Spanish army, but the Spaniards were able to shot Marcelo in the head. Former president Emilio Aguinaldo's private secretary, Carlos V. Ronquillo, described Marcelo as: Memorials Marcela Marcelo‚ÄìLugo monument Marcela Marcelo‚ÄìLugo historical marker A bust of Marcelo was built in the plaza of Malibay in memory of her. It is situated in front of the principal road, C. Jose Street. A school is also named after Marcelo: Marcela Marcelo Elementary School, which is also located in her hometown, Malibay.

Bulira and Mrs. Karitundu were convicted on February 23, 2011. One year later, Bulira was sentenced to 50 years imprisonment while Mrs. Karitundu was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for aiding in the murder of her husband. The judge Justice Catherine Bamugemereire of the High Court of Uganda argued that Mrs. Karitundu didn‚Äôt actually burgeon her husband but needed to be punished for planning a murder. In 2008, after his death, a vigil was held at the Uganda National Theatre for Rutamirika where they premiered a documentary film titled Bye Bye Rutamirika about his life and works. It was organized by the Abfirika Group, a drama group for which Rutamirika was a co-director.

He specialized in landscapes and scenes that involved flowers.  Biography  He was born to a working class family and, at the age of eighteen, had to take a job as an assistant in the local railway office rather than pursue his education. During this time, he attended night classes in drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts in San Telmo, taught by Bernardo Ferr√°ndiz, who noted his exceptional abilities with watercolors. In 1888, he became a teaching assistant there, and was later promoted to full teacher; primarily of artistic drawing. After that, he was named a Professor at the Elementary School of Industry and Fine Arts. Between 1902 and 1903, he temporarily served as Director there, and made the acquaintance of Antonio Mu√±oz Degrain, who had a significant influence on his mature style. Degrain also urged him to move to Madrid, on several occasions, but he chose to remain in his hometown. Among his many activities, he was a corresponding academic of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando and, after 1910, an honorary Academician at san Telmo. He also served on the Provincial Commission of Artistic Monuments. He was a frequent participant in exhibitions and contests, both regional and national. In 1884 and 1887, he was awarded Second Class prizes for his landscapes, at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, followed by a Third Class prize in 1890. He achieved the First Class prize in 1892 with his portrayal of Saint Casilda; a work that was commissioned by a local banker who had a daughter named Casilda. In 1904, he was given an honorable mention. He was also awarded gold medals at the Vatican Exhibition of 1888 and the Exposici√≥n Internacional of 1892, held in Madrid.

Description The Watchman is located immediately east of Springdale, towering 2,600-feet (790 meters) above the town and the floor of Zion Canyon. Zion's park headquarters, the park's south entrance, and Watchman Campground are situated immediately north-northwest of the mountain, which makes it one of the photographic icons of the park. The Watchman is wedged between the North and East Forks of the Virgin River which drain precipitation runoff from this mountain. Its neighbors include Mount Kinesava directly across the canyon to the west, Bridge Mountain, to the north-northeast, and The West Temple is positioned to the northwest. This feature's name was officially adopted in 1934 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. It is believed to be so named because it stands as a watchman guarding the south entrance to the park. It is unclear where the name may have originated; some believe it was Methodist Minister Frederick Vining Fisher. Early pioneers referred to this peak as Flanigan Peak because the Flanigan family homestead was set at the base of this feature.National Park Service nps.gov/zion This mountain is composed of Navajo Sandstone, with a red shale outcropping of the Kayenta Formation along the lower slopes.https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/watchman Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit The Watchman. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.

Introduced in 2019, it is aimed for vehicles built for the Japanese market and overseas emerging markets. The DNGA is claimed to be developed with electrification, autonomous driving and connectivity in mind, which the company refers as \\"CASE\\" (Connected, Automated Driving, Sharing, Electrification).  Overview  The platform was announced in June 2019 through the introduction of the fourth- generation Tanto. Prior to the introduction of the Tanto, the second- generation Mira e:S and the Mira Tocot was claimed to be built above the DNGA, however later it was revealed that both cars is not built on the DNGA, instead it is an older transitional platform which is the origin of the DNGA platform before it was improved further. Most components have been newly developed for the platform, and all components such as the suspension and its mounting points, underbody, engine, transmission, and seating position have been revamped for an optimal and standardized component placement to achieve the desired performance and quality without increasing costs. The structure of chassis parts has been streamlined and the number of parts has been reduced to achieve weight reduction. The platform allows parts sharing rate to exceed 75 percent, making the pace of development introduction of new models 1.5 times faster than before. Since the manufacturing plant is able to utilize a common assembly line for DNGA models, the capital investment of introducing a new product could be reduced by 30 percent. Daihatsu has planned to introduce the platform to 21 models and 15 body types with a targeted annual production of 2.5 million vehicles by 2025. Despite having a name similarity with the parent company's Toyota New Global Architecture, there is no mentions of the platform being related with the TNGA in Daihatsu publications and literatures. Daihatsu executive has said the company did not pursue significant commonality with Toyota platforms.  Applications  The chassis, which is the main component of the platform has been grouped into three types, which are kei car segment, A-segment, and future B-segment products for emerging markets.

The description was published in the journal Zeitschrift der Arbeitsgemeinschaft √ñsterreichischer Entomologen. The hoax was uncovered only in 1973.  Hoax details and background  The hoax was foisted by Hans Malicky, who was the chairperson of the Entomological Society of Austria in the late 1960s. He sought to improve the quality of publishing by the society newsletter Entomologische Nachrichtenblatt which led to him being relieved from the post. The hoax article was published shortly after in 1969. The journal paper described two new species of fleas named Ctenophthalmus nepalensis and Amalareus fossoris, both purportedly from Nepal by the author \\"Otto Suteminn\\". It was not until 1972 that the hoax was uncovered in an article by F.G.A.M. Smit of the Natural History Museum, London who published ‚ÄúNotes on Two Fictitious Fleas from Nepal‚Äù in the journal Entomologische Nachrichtenblatt. Smit identified that not only were the species hoaxes but so were their hosts Canis fossor (meaning grave-digging dog) and Apodemus roseus. Along with an Austrian colleague, Smit figured out that the locality mentioned \\"Khanshnid Khaib\\" was probably the Austrian dialect transcription for \\"Ganz nicht habe\\" which means \\"cannot exist\\"; \\"Samashtir\\" possibly stood for \\"Sind wir Stier\\" which is Viennese slang for \\"we have no money\\"; and the collector name \\"leg. Z. Mina≈ô\\" would mean something like \\"from my anus\\". According to the entomologist Michael Ohl who described the case in his book The Art of Naming (2018), \\"Suteminn\\" was a pseudonym for a fictional knight Otto von Moltke in a story by Karl May in which the knight would retreat into a secret lab and conduct scientific experiments. Another author has identified the Canis fossor as being associated with Arthur Sch√ºtz and his \\"Grubenhund\\", a kind of hoax made popular in Austria. One of the other fleas mentions is A. pencilliger which is Amalaraeus penicilliger , the author's name fitting well into the idea of the Grubenhund.

It is attested in a limited number of late Roman and early Medieval sources, and reportedly occurred in or around the year 448 in the unidentified place of Vicus Helena somewhere in the Civitas Atrebatium, modern Artois.  Reconstruction = Context  The Franks were foederati of the Romans, but regularly plundered towns and villages within the Roman Empire, and somewhere between 445 and 450, Salian Franks under Chlodio conquered the cities of Turnacum (modern Tournai) and Cameracum (modern Cambrai), which became centres of Frankish power. The capture of Cameracum must have happened after 443, because Gregory mentions the Burgundians had already settled east of the river Rh√¥ne. Next, the Franks expanded towards the river Somme. Around 448, the city of Nemetocenna (modern Arras) was probably sacked by the Franks as well.  Battle  Roman general Majorian, who would become the Western Roman emperor in 457, reportedly suppressed a revolt of the Bagaudae in Armorica in 448, and then successfully defended Turonum (modern Tours) against a siege. 'Shortly thereafter', according to Sidonius, the Franks led by 'Cloio' (Chlodio), who were holding a wedding reception, were ambushed by the Romans near Vicus Helena. Aetius directed the operations while Majorian fought with the cavalry.Chronica Gallica Anno 452, 133 (s.a. 438); Sid. Apol. carm. 5.210-218. Cited in Jones, p. 27. Jan Willem Drijvers, Helena Augusta, BRILL, , p. 12. The Romans emerged victorious.  Sources  Most surviving information about the Battle of Vicus Helena comes from the Panegyric to Majorian, written in praise of Majorian's military exploits in 458 by Sidonius Apollinaris: Some circumstantial information is provided by Gregory of Tours in his History of the Franks (Book 2, Chapter 9).  Location and date  For centuries, scholars have not been able to locate Vicus Helena, nor been able to determine the precise date of the battle. In Decline and Fall Volume VI (1789), Edward Gibbon stated that 'both the name and the place are discovered by modern geographers at Lens'. Writing for the Magasin encyclop√©dique in 1797, Guilmot claimed to have discovered it as the village of √âvin, on the road between Tournai and Arras. Alexandre-Joseph-Hidulphe Vincent published an essay in 1840, arguing that neither Lens nor Hesdin (two popular candidates in his time) was plausible, but that Allaines near the Mont Saint-Quentin and the town of P√©ronne was the lost Vicus Helena. Hubert le Bourdell√®s (1984) suggested Saint-Amand Abbey, which used to be known as Elnon(e). Tony Jaques (2007) went with H√©lesmes in the year 431. De Boone (1954) connected Sidonius' reference to a frozen Loire river to the exceptionally harsh winter of 442‚Äì3 mentioned by the Annals of Marcellinus Comes, but Lanting & van der Plicht (2010) rejected this, as Marcellinus doesn't mention any harsh winter in Gaul, and focused mostly on the Eastern Roman Empire; instead, the latter two focused on the military career of Majorian (Sidonius called him a iuvenis or 'young man' in 458, while he had left active military service before 454, suggesting a birth around 420), concluding 445‚Äì450 to be the most likely period for the battle. Dierkens & P√©rin (2003) noted that Majorian had defeated the Bagaudae and freed Tours just before the battle of Vicus Helena; they dated the former two events (and therefore Vicus Helena as well) to 448, and endorsed the H√©lesmes hypothesis. Alexander O'Hara (2018) suggested 'in around 448' at 'an unidentified site in the Artois', positing that it may be connected to the destruction of Arras around that time as well, although it is unknown whether Arras was sacked by Huns or Franks.

Despite its Latin title, Perspectiva corporum regularium is written mainly in the German language. It was \\"the most lavish of the perspective books published in Germany in the late sixteenth century\\" and was included in several royal art collections. It may have been the first work to depict chiral icosahedral symmetry. Topics Great stellated dodecahedron enclosed by a skeletal icosahedron from Perspectiva corporum regularium The book focuses on the five Platonic solids, with the subtitles of its title page citing Plato's Timaeus and Euclid's Elements for their history. Each of these five shapes has a chapter, whose title page relates the connection of its polyhedron to the classical elements in medieval cosmology: fire for the tetrahedron, earth for the cube, air for the octahedron, and water for the icosahedron, with the dodecahedron representing the heavens, its 12 faces corresponding to the 12 symbols of the zodiac. Each chapter includes four engravings of polyhedra, each showing six variations of the shape including some of their stellations and truncations, for a total of 120 polyhedra. This great amount of variation, some of which obscures the original Platonic form of each polyhedron, demonstrates the theory of the time that all the variation seen in the physical world comes from the combination of these basic elements. Following these chapters, additional engravings depict additional polyhedral forms, including polyhedral compounds such as the stella octangula, polyhedral variations of spheres and cones, and outlined skeletons of polyhedra following those drawn by Leonardo da Vinci for Luca Pacioli's earlier book Divina proportione. In this part of the book, the shapes are arranged in a three- dimensional setting and often placed on smaller polyhedral pedestals. Creation process Wenzel Jamnitzer making a perspective drawing, as depicted by Jost Amman (c. 1565) The roughly 50 engravings for the book were made by Jost Amman, a German woodcut artist, based on drawings by Jamnitzer. As Jamnitzer describes in his prologue, he built models of polyhedra out of paper and wood and used a mechanical device to help trace their perspective. This process was depicted in another engraving by Amman from around 1565, showing Jamnitzer at work on his drawings. Amman included this engraving in another book, Das St√§ndebuch (1658). Related works German stamp featuring Jamnitzer's work A later work on perspective, Artes Excelen√ßias de la Perspectiba (1688) by P. G√≥mez de Alcu√±a, was heavily influenced by Jamnitzer. A 2008 German postage stamp, issued to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Jamnitzer's birth, included a reproduction of one of the pages of the book, depicting two polyhedral cones tilted towards each other. The full sheet of ten stamps also includes another figure from the book, a skeletal icosahedron. A French edition of Perspectiva corporum regularium, edited by Albert Flocon, was published by Brieux in 1964.

A graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point class of 1930, he participated in the Manhattan Project and the campaigns in the Southwest Pacific Area during World War II. Early life and career John Henderson (Jack) Dudley was born in Oakland, California, on 25 September 1907, the son of Captain Clark DeWitt Dudley, an Army officer who had earned battlefield commission in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and his wife Margaret Henderson, the daughter of an engineer who oversaw corporate mining operations in the California Mother Lode. Dudley had an older sister, Jane. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, on 1 July 1926. He played football (although he did not earn a varsity letter in that sport), and competed in track athletics and modern pentathlon. He graduated 28th in the class of 1930, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Cavalry. Dudley's first assignment was with the 11th Cavalry Regiment, at the Presidio of San Francisco, on 12 September 1930 to 28 May 1934. He married Lillian Steinschneider in New York City on 12 September 1931. He then went to Fort Riley, Kansas, with 2nd Cavalry Regiment from 15 June to 27 August 1934. He was a student at the Cavalry School there until 14 June 1935, and then became Assistant Post Quartermaster for harvesting hay, with the rank of first lieutenant from 1 August 1935. He attended the Signal Corps School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, from 19 August 1935 to 11 June 1936. He was then posted to Fort Brown, Texas, with the 12th Cavalry Regiment. On 14 August 1936, Dudley transferred to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and he was the 9th Engineer Regiment at Fort Riley. On 25 September 1938, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), from which he graduated with a Master of Science degree in civil engineering on 2 September 1939. He then attended the Army Engineer School at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, from 14 September 1939 to 2 February 1940. He was promoted to captain on 12 June 1940. World War II=Construction in the United States Dudley was the Area Engineer for the Hornell, New York, from 3 July 1940 to 1 April 1941. He was then the executive officer of the Binghamton, New York, Engineer District, until 1 February 1942, and the Syracuse, New York, Area Engineer from 4 January 1942 to 3 August 1942. In this last assignment he was also, from 1 February to 25 October 1942, executive officer of the Syracuse District. He was promoted to major in the Army of the United States on 21 March 1942. At this time, the Syracuse District, which was commanded by Colonel James C. Marshall, was responsible for a $250 million civil and military construction program. Marshall was given a new assignment in June 1942 as district engineer of the Manhattan District, which was responsible for the development of nuclear weapons. Dudley was transferred to the Manhattan District on 25 October 1942, and promoted to lieutenant colonel on 5 November. He was given a special assignment: to find a remote location for the Manhattan Project's Project Y in the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico. In October 1942, he surveyed the area, and he recommended a site near Jemez Springs, New Mexico. Dudley toured the site with Robert Oppenheimer, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Edwin McMillan and others on 16 November. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were worried about the possibility of flooding. The party then moved on to the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Dudley and Groves were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that the site was ideal. Originally intended to accommodate 265 people, it would grow into the town of Los Alamos, New Mexico. After the war, Dudley and his wife Lillian discovered that they had both worked on the Manhattan Project, but had not informed each other due to the project's strict security. Southwest Pacific Area On 11 May 1943, Dudley left the Manhattan District and went to Davis-Monthan Army Air Field in Arizona, where he was with the 929th Engineer Aviation Regiment from 16 to 27 May 1943. He then went to Geiger Field in Washington state, where he assumed command of the 931st Engineer Aviation Regiment on 10 June 1943. He was promoted to colonel on 3 January 1944. The 931st Engineer Aviation Regiment departed the San Francisco Port of Embarkation on 29 January 1944, and arrived at Finschhafen in New Guinea on 27 February. The 931st Engineer Aviation Regiment's first assignment was the design and construction of Mokerang Airfield in the Admiralty Islands. The work involved clearing a plantation with 18,000 coconut trees. Dudley acted as the base engineer at Finschhafen from 6 May to 3 July 1944, then resumed command of the 931st Engineer Aviation Regiment at Hollandia on 1 August. He became the base engineer there, and oversaw the development of Sentani and Hollandia Airfields. The 931st Engineer Aviation Regiment participated in the Battle of Morotai, where Dudley commanded several engineer aviation battalions and No. 61 Wing RAAF. In addition to airfields, he was also called on to construct roads, bridges, hospitals, staging camps, port facilities and headquarters installations. The 931st Engineer Aviation Regiment became the 931st Engineer Combat Group (Aviation) on 24 November 1944. It moved to Leyte in December, and then Luzon in January. For his services, Dudley was awarded the Legion of Merit. Post-war After the war ended, Dudley was the Base Engineer in Nagoya from 9 December 1945 to 9 March 1946, and then commanded the 1190th Base Depot in Yokohama. He was awarded two Commendation Ribbons. He returned to the United States in August 1946, and was stationed at Fort Monroe until 26 August 1947, when he became a student at the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia. He was then assigned to the map and photograph branch of the Department of the Army in Washington, D.C. He attended the Army War College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1950 and 1951, and then returned to Washington, D.C., as the chief of the Planning Branch of the Army Research and Development Division. He was chief engineer of VII Corps in Germany from 1954 to 1956, and was promoted to brigadier general in 1955. He commanded the 18th Engineer Brigade at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, from 1956 to 1958. His final assignment was as Assistant Commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. He retired in 1960 after thirty years of service, with an oak leaf cluster to his Legion of Merit. Dudley joined the faculty of California State University in Long Beach, California, where he founded the Soil Mechanics Laboratory. The College of Engineering library there is now named the John H. Dudley Memorial Library in his honor. He retired from California State University in 1970. His wife Lillian died of cancer in 1977. Dudley was a long-time close friend of Lieutenant General James B. Lampert, a fellow graduate of West Point since the two had attended MIT together. Lampert died from cancer in 1978, and Dudley and Lampert's widow Margery (Gerri) married in 1980. Dudley died in Fairfax, Virginia, on 2 October 1994, and was buried in the West Point Cemetery.

Biography Peisley was born 19 January 1718 at Ballymore, County Kildare: her mother Rachel ( Burton) was from Mannin, County Tipperary, and her father John from Baltiboys, County Wicklow. The family moved in 1723 to a farm at Paddock, Mountrath, County Laois (then known as \\"Queen's County\\"), where she was based for the rest of her life until her marriage. She had little formal education and entered domestic service, until at the age of 26 she began to speak at Quaker meetings. Peisley preached around Ireland with Elizabeth Tomey in 1746, and toured England in 1748-50, riding in 29 months and attending 525 meetings. She toured Ireland again in 1751. At an annual London meeting, she, Catherine Payton and four others proposed that a separate women's group should be formed with the Quakers. This was accepted, but not until 1784. Peisley travelled to America in 1753-1756 with Catherine Payton. They rode \\"often through thinly inhabited country, braving dangerous creeks, swamps, and wild animals\\", visiting North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New England, and Pennsylvania. During their tour Peisley noted a \\"low state of discipline\\" among Quakers in America, and saw a need for reformation. Her letters and records of this journey \\"were to be seen 70 years later as prophesying the separations that took place within the Religious Society of Friends in 1827 and 1828\\". Peisley spoke against slavery and held meetings with African Americans, writing to Quakers in Virginia in 1754 that \\"one thing the friends here ... were in the practice of, which gave us considerable pain ... that is, buying and keeping of slaves which we could not reconcile with the golden rule of doing unto all men as we would they should do unto us\\". On 17 March 1757 at Mountrath she married Samuel Neale (1729-1792), who had first heard her preach in Cork in about 1750 and had subsequently become a Quaker minister. She died three days later of \\"cholic\\" and is buried in the Quaker cemetery at Mountrath. Her widower Samuel assembled and published a collection of her writings.

He then worked at a transport company in Venlo but was allowed time to attend entomology lectures at the University of Wageningen. He had collected beetles from childhood, but in 1941 he suddenly noticed a lack of knowledge on lice and fleas.

Plants live in association with diverse microbial consortia.

(2019) \\"A review on the plant microbiome: Ecology, functions, and emerging trends in microbial application\\". Journal of advanced research, 19: 29_37.. Plant microbiomes are shaped by both factors related to the plant itself, such as genotype, organ, species and health status, as well as factors related to the plant's environment, such as management, land use and climate. The health status of a plant has been reported in some studies to be reflected by or linked to its microbiome. Overview Schematic plant and plant-associated microbiota colonizing different niches on and inside the plant tissue. All the above-ground plant parts together, called the phyllosphere, are a continuously evolving habitat due to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and altering climatic conditions. It is primarily composed of leaves. Below-ground plant parts, mainly roots, are generally influenced by soil properties. Harmful interactions affect the plant growth through pathogenic activities of some microbiota members (left side). On the other hand, beneficial microbial interactions promote plant growth (right side).Shelake, R.M., Pramanik, D. and Kim, J.Y.

Microorganisms, 7(8): 269. . 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The study of the association of plants with microorganisms precedes that of the animal and human microbiomes, notably the roles of microbes in nitrogen and phosphorus uptake. The most notable examples are plant root-arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and legume-rhizobial symbioses, both of which greatly influence the ability of roots to uptake various nutrients from the soil. Some of these microbes cannot survive in the absence of the plant host (obligate symbionts include viruses and some bacteria and fungi), which provides space, oxygen, proteins, and carbohydrates to the microorganisms. The association of AM fungi with plants has been known since 1842, and over 80% of land plants are found associated with them. It is thought AM fungi helped in the domestication of plants.Dastogeer, K.M., Tumpa, F.H., Sultana, A., Akter, M.A. and Chakraborty, A. (2020) \\"Plant microbiome‚Äìan account of the factors that shape community composition and diversity\\".

In this animation a root tuber is being colonized by an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Traditionally, plant-microbe interaction studies have been confined to culturable microbes. The numerous microbes that couldn't be cultured have remained uninvestigated, so knowledge of their roles is largely unknown. The possibilities of unraveling the types and outcomes of these plant-microbe interactions has generated considerable interest among ecologists, evolutionary biologists, plant biologists, and agronomists. Recent developments in multiomics and the establishment of large collections of microorganisms have dramatically increased knowledge of the plant microbiome composition and diversity. The sequencing of marker genes of entire microbial communities, referred to as metagenomics, sheds light on the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiomes of plants. It also adds to the knowledge of the major biotic and abiotic factors responsible for shaping plant microbiome community assemblages. The focus of plant microbiome studies has been directed at model plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as important economic crop species including barley (Hordeum vulgare), corn (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), soybean (Glycine max), wheat (Triticum aestivum), whereas less attention has been given to fruit crops and tree species. The plant microbiota Diverse microbial communities of characteristic microbiota are part of plant microbiomes, and are found on the outside surfaces and in the internal tissues of the host plant, as well as in the surrounding soil. Rhizosphere microbiome microbial networks formed on roots. a) Overview of an A. thaliana root (primary root) with numerous root hairs. b) Biofilm-forming bacteria. c) Fungal or oomycete hyphae surrounding the root surface. d) Primary root densely covered by spores and protists. e, f) Protists, most likely belonging to the Bacillariophyceae class. g) Bacteria and bacterial filaments. h, i) Different bacterial individuals showing great varieties of shapes and morphological features.Hassani, M.A., Dur√°n, P. and Hacquard, S. (2018) \\"Microbial interactions within the plant holobiont\\". Microbiome, 6(1): 58. . 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The rhizosphere comprises the 1‚Äì10 mm zone of soil immediately surrounding the roots that is under the influence of the plant through its deposition of root exudates, mucilage and dead plant cells. A diverse array of organisms specialize in living in the rhizosphere, including bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, nematodes, algae, protozoa, viruses, and archaea. The most frequently studied beneficial rhizosphere organisms are mycorrhizae, rhizobium bacteria, plant- growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), and biocontrol microbes. It has been projected that one gram of soil could contain more than one million distinct bacterial genomes, and over 50,000 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) have been found within the potato rhizosphere. Among the prokaryotes in the rhizosphere, the most frequent bacteria are within the Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. In some studies, no significant differences were reported in the microbial community composition between the bulk soil (soil not attached to the plant root) and rhizosphere soil. Certain bacterial groups (e. g. Actinobacteria, Xanthomonadaceae) are less abundant in the rhizosphere than in nearby bulk soil . Mycorrhizal fungi are abundant members of the rhizosphere community, and have been found in over 200,000 plant species, and are estimated to associate with over 80% of all plants. Mycorrhizae‚Äìroot associations play profound roles in land ecosystems by regulating nutrient and carbon cycles. Mycorrhizae are integral to plant health because they provide up to 80% of the nitrogen and phosphorus requirements. In return, the fungi obtain carbohydrates and lipids from host plants. Recent studies of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi using sequencing technologies show greater between-species and within-species diversity than previously known. Phyllosphere microbiome A leaf from a healthy Arabidopsis plant (left) and a leaf from a dysbiosis mutant plant (right)He, Sheng Yang (2020) When plants and their microbes are not in sync, the results can be disastrous The Conversation, 28 August 2020. The aerial surface of a plant (stem, leaf, flower, fruit) is called the phyllosphere and is considered comparatively nutrient poor when compared to the rhizosphere and endosphere. The environment in the phyllosphere is more dynamic than the rhizosphere and endosphere environments. Microbial colonizers are subjected to diurnal and seasonal fluctuations of heat, moisture, and radiation. In addition, these environmental elements affect plant physiology (such as photosynthesis, respiration, water uptake etc.) and indirectly influence microbiome composition. Rain and wind also cause temporal variation to the phyllosphere microbiome. Overall, there remains high species richness in phyllosphere communities. Fungal communities are highly variable in the phyllosphere of temperate regions and are more diverse than in tropical regions. There can be up to 107 microbes per square centimetre present on the leaf surfaces of plants, and the bacterial population of the phyllosphere on a global scale is estimated to be 1026 cells. The population size of the fungal phyllosphere is likely to be smaller. Phyllosphere microbes from different plants appear to be somewhat similar at high levels of taxa, but at the lower levels taxa there remain significant differences. This indicates microorganisms may need finely tuned metabolic adjustment to survive in phyllosphere environment. Proteobacteria seems to be the dominant colonizers, with Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria also predominant in phyllospheres. Although there are similarities between the rhizosphere and soil microbial communities, very little similarity has been found between phyllosphere communities and microorganisms floating in open air (aeroplankton). Endosphere microbiome Some microorganisms, such as endophytes, penetrate and occupy the plant internal tissues, forming the endospheric microbiome. The AM and other endophytic fungi are the dominant colonizers of the endosphere. Bacteria, and to some degree archaea, are important members of endosphere communities. Some of these endophytic microbes interact with their host and provide obvious benefits to plants. Unlike the rhizosphere and the rhizoplane, the endospheres harbor highly specific microbial communities. The root endophytic community can be very distinct from that of the adjacent soil community. In general, diversity of the endophytic community is lower than the diversity of the microbial community outside the plant. The identity and diversity of the endophytic microbiome of above-and below-ground tissues may also differ within the plant.

South Africa is a region of high biodiversity in the terrestrial and marine realms. The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries, and is rated among the top 10 for plant species diversity and third for marine endemism. This biodiversity is monitored and reported in terms of the continental terrestrial, inland aquatic, coastal, marine and the sub-antarctic Prince Edward Islands components. South Africa is a party to the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, and has declared a number of protected areas, including national parks and marine protected areas which are managed by the national government. Continuing research and periodical reporting on the biodiversity of South Africa is the responsibility of the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) as directed by the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, and authorised by various statutory acts. SANBI reports an estimate of about 67,000 animal species, and more than 20,400 plant species that have been described. Almost a quarter of the global cephalopod species, about 16% of elasmobranch species, 13% of the world‚Äôs sunspiders (Solifugae), nearly 10% of the world coral species, 8% of seaweeds, 7% of vascular plants, 7% of the birds, 5% of the mammals, nearly 5% of butterflies, 4% of the reptiles, 2% of the amphibians, and 1% of the freshwater fish of the world are found in the country and its exclusive economic zone, including the Prince Edward Islands. Almost two thirds of South Africa‚Äôs plant species, about half of the species of reptiles, amphibians, butterflies and freshwater fish, and about 40% of the estimated 10,000 marine animal species are endemic. Global context Biodiversity is the variety and variability of life on Earth. It is typically a measure of variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem level. and is not distributed evenly, generally being richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity is usually highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest, and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described. More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described. The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries, with high levels of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. The main criterion for megadiverse countries is endemism at the level of species, genera and families. A megadiverse country must have at least 5,000 species of endemic plants and must border marine ecosystems. South Africa is one of the smaller megadiverse countries, with a terrestrial area of about 1.2 million km2 and is rated among the top 10 for plant species diversity. The EEZ is about 1.1 million km2 and is rated third for marine endemism.  Measuring diversity  Biodiversity is usually plotted as the richness of a geographic area, with some reference to a temporal scale. Types of biodiversity include taxonomic or species, ecological, morphological, and genetic diversity. Taxonomic diversity, that is the number of species, genera, or families, is the most commonly assessed type. The estimated number of South African animal species as of 2018 is about 67 000, with 20 401 plant species described. This comprises about 7% of the world‚Äôs vascular plants, 7% of birds, 5% of mammals, 4% of reptiles, 2% of amphibians and 1% of freshwater fishes. Less information is available on invertebrate groups, but South Africa has almost a quarter of global cephalopods, and some terrestrial invertebrate groups are very strongly represented. Evolutionary history The age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years. The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon. There are microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old meta-sedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland. More recently, in 2015, \\"remains of biotic life\\" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. Since life began on Earth, five major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity. The Phanerozoic eon (the last 540 million years) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the Cambrian explosion‚Äîa period during which the majority of multicellular phyla first appeared. The next 400 million years included repeated, massive biodiversity losses classified as mass extinction events. In the Carboniferous, rainforest collapse led to a great loss of plant and animal life. The Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, 251 million years ago, was the worst; vertebrate recovery took 30 million years. The most recent, the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, occurred 65 million years ago and has often attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs. The period since the emergence of humans has displayed an ongoing biodiversity reduction and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity. Named the Holocene extinction, the reduction is caused primarily by human impacts, particularly habitat destruction.Conversely, biodiversity positively impacts human health in a number of ways, although a few negative effects are studied. Taxonomic biodiversity of a region may increase either by influx of species from other regions or by speciation within the region. The former is facilitated by physical connections to other regions of compatible habitability, by the mobility of the affected organisms at some stage of their life cycle, and by agents contributing to dispersal. Speciation in situ is facilitated by reproductive isolation and changes in the environmental pressures on the local populations. Many regions of high biodiversity or endemism arise from habitats which require unusual adaptations. Biological realms=Terrestrial (continental)  The continental terrestrial component of the region lies within the Afrotropic biogeographic realm. Inland aquaticEstuarine Marine According to the WWF scheme, the coastal waters of continental South Africa mostly lie within the marine realm of Temperate Southern Africa, with a part in the Western Indo-Pacific. The boundary between the Temperate Southern Africa and Western Indo-Pacific marine realms is near Lake St. Lucia, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, near the border with Mozambique. The marine biodiversity of South Africa is the variety of living organisms that live in the seas off the coast of South Africa. It includes genetic, species and ecosystems biodiversity in a range of habitats spread over a range of ecologically varied regions, influenced by the geomorphology of the seabed and circulation of major and local water masses, which distribute both living organisms and nutrients in complex and time-variable patterns. South Africa has a wide range of marine diversity with coastline in three oceans, two major current systems, major ocean frontal systems and benthic topography extending to a maximum depth of 5 700 m. There are 179 defined marine ecosystem types, 150 of them around South Africa and 29 around the sub-Antarctic territory of the Prince Edward Islands. Coastal Since 2018 the National Biodiversity Assessment has produced a separate coastal report, combining data from marine portions of the coastal zone with estuaries and dunes along with beaches and rocky shores, defining the coastal zone as an ecologically determined cross- realm zone spanning the coastal parts of the marine and terrestrial realms, and including all estuaries, within which relevant results from the constituent realms are presented together. This analyses biodiversity across the land-sea interface compares it with the non-coastal parts of the terrestrial and marine realms. Vegetation types on the landward side of the coastal zone are included in the ecologically defined coast if they are purely coastal or have a coastal affinity, and least 70% of their area is within 10 km of the shore. On the seaward side, ecosystem types that are influenced by the land are considered to be coastal, and include ecosystems extending as far offshore as the back of the inner shelf, bays, and marine ecosystem types influenced by rivers. Estuarine Functional Zones (EFZs) are also considered to be part of the coast. The ecologically defined coastal zone is estimated to comprise about 4% of mainland terrestrial area, but includes 186 of the 987 ecosystem types, high biodiversity, and many endemic species, particularly along the south coast. This is largely due to large variations in coastal conditions affected by the warm Agulhas Current on the east coast, and cool Benguela Current along the west coast, distinct variations in temperature and rainfall patterns and variations in geology. Coastal parts of ecosystems tend to be hotspots of cumulative pressure, which often causes poor ecological condition in those areas. Ports and harbours have been identified as centres of cumulative impacts and ecological degradation. Intensive pressures on coastal areas include use of biological resources, coastal development, and mining. Coastal species of economic value which are accessible are likely to be over-exploited. Estuaries are often subjected to major flow modification due to upstream water use, which has adverse impacts on many coastal ecosystem types. For example, sand supplies to beaches and dunes are severely reduced, which affects erosion rates. Climate change and invasive species increase pressures on coastal biodiversity, and much of the pressure due to pollution is poorly understood. 60% of coastal ecosystem types making up 55% of the coastal zone area, have been identified to be threatened, with a high risk of biodiversity loss in 13 ecosystems, while 9% of the coastal zone area is protected, providing good protection to about 24% of coastal ecosystem types. The three South African regions of high plant diversity and endemism all occur partly along the coast. They are the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany Hotspot, the Succulent Karoo Region, and the Cape Floristic Region. The coastal zone provides a rich variety of organisms useful to people as food, medicine, fuel and raw materials for construction and crafts. There are more than 220 coastal plant species recorded as useful for these purposes from South Africa. Many coastal inhabitants rely to some extent on estuarine and marine fish and invertebrates as part of their diet, and the money saved by harvesting natural resources can be used for other needs, which is a significant benefit for economically marginal families. About a million people engage in recreational fishing, and the fishery is estimated to have a value of about R1.6 billion in 2018. Some 147 communities and 29000 people are involved in subsistence fishing, harvesting fish, rock lobster, abalone, bait organisms and other interidal resources, to an estimated value of about R16 million in 2018, about 85% of which is linefishing. The major importance of this sector is in employment and food security of poor coastal communities. Sub-Antarctic The Prince Edward Islands are Marion Island and Prince Edward Island, two small islands in the subantarctic Indian Ocean that are part of South Africa. The islands have been declared Special Nature Reserves under the South African Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act, No. 57 of 2003, and activities on the islands are therefore restricted to research and conservation management. Further protection was granted when the area was declared a marine protected area in 2013. The only human inhabitants of the islands are the staff of a meteorological and biological research station run by the South African National Antarctic Programme on Marion Island. Ecoregions An ecoregion (ecological region) is an ecologically and geographically defined area that is smaller than a bioregion, which in turn is smaller than a biogeographic realm. Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species. The biodiversity of flora, fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation. An ecoregion will typically include several habitat types. Terrestrial ecoregions Terrestrial ecoregions are land ecoregions, as distinct from freshwater and marine ecoregions. The WWF divides the land surface of the Earth into eight biogeographical realms containing 867 smaller terrestrial ecoregions. The eight realms follow the major floral and faunal boundaries, identified by botanists and zoologists, that separate the world's major plant and animal communities. Realm boundaries generally follow continental boundaries, or major barriers to plant and animal distribution, like the Himalayas and the Sahara. Ecoregions are classified by biome type, which are the major global plant communities determined by rainfall and climate. Forests, grasslands (including savanna and shrubland), and deserts (including xeric shrublands) are distinguished by climate (tropical and subtropical vs. temperate and boreal climates) and, for forests, by whether the trees are predominantly conifers (gymnosperms), broadleaf (Angiosperms), or mixed (broadleaf and conifer). Biome types like Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub; tundra; and mangroves host very distinct ecological communities, and are also recognized as distinct biome types. Listed by biome: Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests;  * Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands;  Montane grasslands and shrublands;  * Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub;  Deserts and xeric shrublands;  Tundra; * Mangroves; * =Terrestrial habitat types= In ecology, a habitat is the type of natural environment in which a particular species of organism lives. A species's habitat is those places where the species can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is characterized by both physical and biological features. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss; a parasitic organism has as its habitat the body of its host, part of the host's body (such as the digestive tract), or a single cell within the host's body. Geographic habitat types include polar, temperate, subtropical and tropical. The terrestrial vegetation type may be forest, steppe, grassland, semi-arid or desert. Fresh-water habitats include marshes, streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds; marine habitats include salt marshes, the coast, the intertidal zone, estuaries, reefs, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and submarine vents. Habitats may change over time. Causes of change may include a violent event, or change may occur more gradually over millennia with alterations in the climate. Other changes come as a direct result of human activities. The introduction of alien species can have a devastating effect on native wildlife, through increased predation, competition for resources or the introduction of pests and diseases to which the indigenous species have no immunity. Marine ecoregions Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone (redefined 2011) The marine ecoregions of the South African exclusive economic zone are a set of geographically delineated regions of similar ecological characteristics on a fairly broad scale, covering the exclusive economic zone along the South African coast. There were originally five inshore bioregions over the continental shelf and four offshore bioregions covering the continental slope and abyssal regions. These bioregions are used for conservation research and planning. They were defined in the South African National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment of 2004. The South African National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment of 2011 amended this to reduce the number of regions to four inshore and two offshore and rename them as ecoregions. Inshore ecoregions:  * Offshore ecoregions: * * =Marine habitat types= A total of 136 marine habitat types have been identified. The classification takes connectivity, depth and slope, substrate geology and sediment grain size, shoreline wave exposure, and biogeography into account. Beach state considers the wave exposure and grain size. These habitats include 37 coastal types, 17 inshore types in the 5 to 30 m depth range, 62 offshore benthic types deeper than 30 m, and 16 offshore pelagic types, three types of island and one type of lagoon.

native to a single defined geographic location, such as an island, nation, country or other defined zone, or habitat type; organisms that are indigenous to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere. The extreme opposite of an endemic species is one with a cosmopolitan distribution, having a global or widespread range, and the opposite to an indigenous species in an introduced or invasive species. Terrestrial The Cape Floristic Region, the smallest of the six recognised floral kingdoms of the world, is an area of extraordinarily high diversity and endemism, and is home to over 9,000 vascular plant species, of which 69 percent are endemic. Much of this diversity is associated with the fynbos biome, a Mediterranean-type, fire-prone shrubland. Several species are endemic to extremely limited habitats, and are under severe pressure due to habitat reduction and degradation. Marine Over 13000 species of marine organisms are recorded from South African waters. Endemism is estimated at between 26 and 33%, the third highest marine endemism after New Zealand (51%) and Antarctica (45%). This varies between taxonomic groups from no endemic marine mammals or birds, to over 90% of chitons. The region of highest known endemism is the south coast Agulhas inshore ecoregion, which is relatively far from the national borders, and relatively isolated from large scale oceanic circulation due to the effects of the widening of the continental shelf at the Agulhas Bank on the path of the Agulhas current, and far from other warm temperate regions. This region is largely bypassed by the Agulhas current, and has cooler inshore water due to upwelling, making it less hospitable to tropical Indo-west Pacific species. It is also isolated from the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean, so has been more prone to niche speciation. Centres of diversity * Succulent Karoo - the arid area to the north and west of the Cape fynbos. * Cape Floristic Region - * Griqualand West Centre - the arid area roughly between Prieska, Vryburg, Vorstershoop and Upington in the Northern Cape Province. The vegetation is mainly a variety of bushveld, grassland and Karoo types. * Albany Centre - in the Eastern Cape from the Kei River to about Middelburg, Aberdeen and the Baviaanskloof Mountains, with a transitional climate between the winter-rainfall of the Western Cape and the summer-rainfall of eastern southern Africa, with a large variety of vegetation types. * Drakensberg Alpine Cantre - the highest altitude mountain region of southern Africa including most of Lesotho, the mountainous area around Barkly East in the Eastern Cape, and the eastern slopes of the Drakensberg through the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Free State southwest of Harrismith. Van Rooy (2000) considers this to be one of the main centres of diversity of mosses in southern Africa. * Soutpansberg Centre - the mountains from the Blouberg in the west, along the Soutpansberg, separating the Limpopo Valley from the rest of South Africa, and parts of the Limpopo valley into the north- western corner of the Kruger National Park. * Wolkberg Centre - the escarpment areas previously known as the Transvaal Drakensberg, between Carolina, Mpumalanga, in the south to Haenertsburg, Limpopo Province in the north, and west to Zebediela. * Sekhukhuneland Centre - a drier area inland of the escarpment of the Wolkberg Centre, on basic and ultramafic rocks of the Bushveld Igneous Complex. * Barberton Centre - the mountains between Barberton in Mpumalanga Province, and the border with Eswatini. * Maputaland-Pondoland Region - most of KwaZulu-Natal, with the edges extending into neighbouring areas, particularly southern Mozambique and the Eastern Cape. The area contains various grassland, thicket and forest types. Genetic diversity Genetic diversity is the amount of variation in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of distinct individuals, representing the genetic characteristics of a species. From a conservation perspective, genetic diversity appears to be highly variable in populations and species. Genetic diversity is important for evolutionary potential, as it serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the new environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. The population will continue for more generations because of the success of these individuals. The methods of measuring genetic diversity of a region include: * Species richness, a measure of the number of species, * Species abundance, a relative measure of the abundance of species, * Species density, an evaluation of the total number of species per unit area Stochastic simulation software can be used to predict the future of a population given measurements such as allele frequency and population size. Hotspots Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany Hotspot Succulent Karroo location map A biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened by human habitation. Around the world, 36 areas qualify under this definition. These sites support nearly 60% of the world's plant, bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species, with a very high proportion of those species as endemics. Some of these hotspots support as many as 15,000 endemic plant species and some have lost up to 95% of their natural habitat. Biodiversity hotspots support their diverse ecosystems on just 2.4% of the planet's surface, but the area defined as hotspots covers a much larger proportion of the land, at about 15.7% of the land surface area, where they have lost around 85% of their original habitat. Three of these hotspots are largely or entirely within South Africa: Fynbos in the Western Cape A 360 degree photograph of fynbos in the Groot Winterhoek region of the Western Cape about 18 months after a fire. New plants can be seen in various stages of growth following the fire. The infertile white soil that fynbos tends to grow in can also be clearly seen. Click here to see the photograph in 360 degrees. The Cape Floristic Region is the smallest of the six recognised floral kingdoms of the world, is an area of extraordinarily high diversity and endemism, and is home to over 9,000 vascular plant species, of which 69 percent are endemic. Much of this diversity is associated with the fynbos biome, a Mediterranean-type, fire-prone shrubland. The economical worth of fynbos biodiversity, based on harvests of fynbos products (e.g. wildflowers) and eco-tourism, is estimated to be in the region of R77 million a year. Thus, it is clear that the Cape Floristic Region has both economic and intrinsic biological value as a biodiversity hotspot. The Maputaland- Pondoland-Albany Hotspot is situated near the south-eastern coast of Africa, occupying an area between the Great Escarpment and the Indian Ocean. The area is named after Maputaland, Pondoland and Albany. It stretches from the Albany Centre of Plant Endemism in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, through the Pondoland Centre of Plant Endemism and KwaZulu-Natal Province, the eastern side of Eswatini (known as Swaziland until 2018) and into southern Mozambique and Mpumalanga. The Maputaland Centre of Plant Endemism is contained in northern KwaZulu-Natal and southern Mozambique. The Succulent Karoo lies along the coastal strip of southwestern Namibia and South Africa's Northern Cape Province, where the cold Benguela Current offshore creates frequent fogs. The ecoregion extends inland into the uplands of South Africa's Western Cape Province. It is bounded on the south by the Mediterranean climate fynbos, on the east by the Nama Karoo, which has more extreme temperatures and variable rainfall, and on the north by the Namib Desert. Species lists A simple measure of taxonomic biodiversity is the count or listing of taxa found within a region. This may be recorded as species checklists. Since the number of species may be large, a checklist may be split into lists of species in a specified taxon at whatever level is convenient. For some taxa, a list by phylum is manageable, for others lists may be broken down to family level. Within the lists, the detail is generally at species level, but may vary depending on the available information, and a utilitarian approach is used, providing availabile detail that appears useful and reliable. A taxon may be labelled to indicate that it is endemic, indigenous, introduced, cultivated, or invasive. Flora 23,420 species of vascular plant have been recorded in South Africa, making it the sixth most species-rich country in the world and the most species-rich country on the African continent. Of these, 153 species are considered to be threatened. Nine biomes have been described in South Africa: Fynbos, Succulent Karoo, desert, Nama Karoo, grassland, savanna, Albany thickets, the Indian Ocean coastal belt, and forests. The 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment plant checklist lists 35,130 taxa in the phyla Anthocerotophyta (hornworts (6)), Anthophyta (flowering plants(33534)), Bryophyta (mosses (685)), Cycadophyta (cycads (42)), Lycopodiophyta (Lycophytes(45)), Marchantiophyta (liverworts (376)), Pinophyta (conifers (33)), and Pteridophyta (cryptogams(408)).   * * Fauna * ‚Äì List of Acanthocephala of South Africa * ‚Äì List of annelids of South Africa ** *** *** ** *Arthropoda **Arachnida ***Astigmata, Mesostigmata, Prostigmata, Oribatida ***Ixodida ***Amblypygi ***Araneae ***Opiliones ***Palpigradi ***Pseudoscorpiones ***Schizomida ***Scorpiones ***Solifugae **Branchiopoda ***Anostraca ***Conchostraca ***Cladocera ***Notostraca **Chilopoda **Diplopoda **Entognatha ***Collembola ***Diplura **Insecta ***Archaeognatha *** *** ***Dermaptera ***Diptera ***Embioptera ***Ephemeroptera ***Notoptera ***Hemiptera *** ***Isoptera *** ****List of butterflies of South Africa ****List of moths of South Africa *****List of moths of South Africa (Arctiinae) *****List of moths of South Africa (Crambidae) *****List of moths of South Africa (Gelechiidae) *****List of moths of South Africa (Geometridae) *****List of moths of South Africa (Nepticulidae) *****List of moths of South Africa (Noctuidae) *****List of moths of South Africa (Pyralidae) *****List of moths of South Africa (Tortricidae) ***Mantodea ***Mecoptera ***Megaloptera ***Neuroptera ***Odonata ***Orthoptera ***Phasmida ***Phthiraptera ***Plecoptera ***Psocoptera ***Siphonaptera ***Strepsiptera ***Thysanoptera ***Trichoptera ***Zygentoma **Malacostraca ‚Äì List of marine crustaceans of South Africa#Malacostraca ***Amphipoda ***Bathynellacea ***Cumacea ***Decapoda ***Euphausiacea ***Isopoda ***Leptostraca ***Mysida ***Spelaeogriphacea ***Stomatopoda ***Tanaidacea **Maxillopoda ‚Äì List of marine crustaceans of South Africa#Maxillopoda ***Branchiura ***Copepoda ‚Äì List of marine crustaceans of South Africa#Copepoda ***Mystacocarida ***Pentastomida ***Thecostraca **Ostracoda ‚Äì List of marine crustaceans of South Africa#Ostracoda **Pauropoda **Pycnogonida ‚Äì List of sea spiders of South Africa **Symphyla *Brachiopoda *Bryozoa *Chaetognatha *Chordata ** *** List of marine spiny-finned fishes of South Africa **** List of marine Perciform fishes of South Africa ***** List of marine fishes of the suborder Percoidei of South Africa **Amphibia **Appendicularia/Thaliacea **Ascidiacea **Aves ‚Äì List of birds of South Africa **Cephalochordata **Chondrichthyes ‚Äì List of marine fishes of South Africa#Chondrichtyes **Mammalia ‚Äì List of mammals of South Africa **Myxini ‚Äì List of marine fishes of South Africa#Myxini **Reptilia ***List of lizards of South Africa **Sarcopterygii ‚Äì List of marine bony fishes of South Africa#Sarcopterygii *Cnidaria ‚Äì List of marine cnidarians of South Africa *Ctenophora ‚Äì List of comb jellies of South Africa *Cycliophora *Echinodermata ‚Äì List of echinoderms of South Africa *Echiura *Entoprocta *Gastrotricha *Gnathostomulida *Hemichordata *Kinorhyncha *Loricifera *Micrognathozoa *Mollusca **Aplacophora ‚Äì List of marine molluscs of South Africa **Bivalvia ‚Äì List of marine molluscs of South Africa **Cephalopoda ‚Äì List of marine molluscs of South Africa **Gastropoda ‚Äì List of marine gastropods of South Africa ***List of marine heterobranch gastropods of South Africa **Polyplacophora ‚Äì List of marine molluscs of South Africa **Scaphopoda ‚Äì List of marine molluscs of South Africa *Myxozoa *Nematoda *Nematomorpha *Nemertea *Onychophora *Orthonectida *Phoronida *Placozoa *Platyhelminthes **Cestoda **Monogenea **Trematoda **Turbellaria *Porifera ‚Äì List of sponges of South Africa *Priapulida *Rhombozoa *Rotifera *Sipuncula *Tardigrada *Xenacoelomorpha  Fungi  By 1945, more than 4900 species of fungi (including lichen-forming species) had been recorded, and by 2006, the number of fungi in South Africa was estimated at about 200,000 species, without taking into account fungi associated with insects. If correct, then the number of South African fungi dwarfs that of its plants. In at least some major South African ecosystems, an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur. The country's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan does not mention fungi (including lichen-forming fungi). = History = I.B. Pole Evans established a national collection of fungi in Pretoria after his appointment in 1905. The previously existing collections of MacOwan and Medley Wood comprised 765 specimens. By 1950 the collection included more than 35 000 fungal specimens. The collections of P.A. van der Bijl and L. Verwoerd were housed at Stellenbosch, and the P. MacOwan collection and Bolus herbarium collectionsat Cape Town. Several European herbaria, including Kew and the International Mycological Institute also held collections. E. M. Doidge (1950) summarised the content, listing 835 species of Ascomycetes, 1704 Basidiomycetes, 93 Myxomycetes, 77 Phycomycetes, 1159 lichens, and 880 fungi imperfecti, with a total of 4748 species.

Local losses can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration or ecological resilience, or effectively permanent. Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, both within the ecosystem, and for human populations relying on it. Habitat change by way of habitat fragmentation or habitat destruction) is the most important driver currently affecting biodiversity, as some 40% of forests and ice-free habitats have been converted to cropland or pasture. Other drivers are: overexploitation, pollution, invasive species, and climate change. Human impacts According to a 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services by IPBES, 25% of plant and animal species are globally threatened with extinction as the result of human activity. As a region with high endemic diversity and three major biodiversity hotspots, South Africa is one of the regions where this is highly significant. Climate change Climate change includes both the global warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases, and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns.; While there have been previous periods of climatic change, changes observed since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented in rate and scale. Endangered species An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular region. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration. Extinction Rapid environmental changes typically cause mass extinctions. More than 99.9 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, amounting to over five billion species, are estimated to be extinct. Economic value Ways in which the biodiversity of SA has economic value to the inhabitants *Natural resources *Employment opportunities *Tourism industry The economical worth of fynbos biodiversity, based on harvests of fynbos products (e.g. wildflowers) and eco-tourism, is estimated to be in the region of R77 million a year. Thus, it is clear that the Cape Floristic Region has both economic and intrinsic biological value as a biodiversity hotspot. Management South Africa signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 4 June 1994, and became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995. It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 7 June 2006. Responsibility *Government department - Department of the Environment, Forestry and Fisheries. Previous departments: DEAT etc *Laws Sustainable use Ecotourism in South Africa has become more prevalent as a possible method of supporting the maintenance of biodiversity. Protection=Protected areas The protected areas of South Africa include national parks and marine protected areas managed by the national government, public nature reserves managed by provincial and local governments, and private nature reserves managed by private landowners. Most protected areas are intended for the conservation of flora and fauna. National parks are maintained by South African National Parks (SANParks). A number of national parks have been incorporated in transfrontier conservation areas. Research=Research institutions The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) is an organisation established in 2004 in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, No 10 of 2004, under the South African Department of Environmental Affairs (later named Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries), tasked with research and dissemination of information on biodiversity, and legally mandated to contribute to the management of the country‚Äôs biodiversity resources. * * Marine research:  National Biodiversity Assessment The National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) is a recurring project by the South African National Biodiversity Institute in collaboration with the government department currently responsible for environmental affairs and several other organisations to assess the state of South Africa's biodiversity over time as an input for policy and decision making where the environment may be affected. The NBA looks into genetic, species and ecosystems biodiversity for terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine and marine environments. Each assessment cycle nominally takes approximately five years, and both generates new knowledge and analyses existing knowledge. NBA reports are named for the year of the data, and are usually published in the following year. They have been published for 2004, 2011, and 2018, and include reports, data, and supplementary documents.

Founded in London in 1962, the company has grown to include eight sites across the United Kingdom, including in Bristol, Chippenham, Hastings, Merthyr Tydfil, Oakdale and Rotherham. With a specialism in armoured fighting vehicles, avionic systems and tactical communications, the company has produced the General Dynamics Ajax armoured fighting vehicle, the Ocelot light protected patrol vehicle and the Bowman communications system. It is one of the UK's leading defence companies and a key supplier to the UK Ministry of Defence. History The company was originally founded as Computing Devices, part of the General Dynamics Information Systems and Technology group, in 1962. In 1997, General Dynamics acquired Computing Devices Ltd which had been based in Hastings, East Sussex since 1974. The company was responsible for supplying avionics to the Tornado GR1, Harrier GR7, Nimrod MR2 and Eurofighter Typhoon. These were praised for their effectiveness during both the Falklands War and Gulf War. More recently, the company provided avionics for the AgustaWestland AW101 Mk3 and Mk4 and AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat helicopters. In 2001, Computing Devices Canada (CDC) won a ¬£1.7 billion contract from the UK Ministry of Defence to deliver Bowman, a communications system for the British Armed Forces, beating competing bids from Thales and TRW. The work was carried out at a newly-opened UK headquarters in Oakdale, South Wales and under the new name of General Dynamics UK Limited, having previously been known as CDC Systems UK Limited. The Bowman system was to equip some 20,000 vehicles, 149 naval vessels, 350 aircraft and 100,000 service personnel. It was successfully delivered from March 2004. General Dynamics Ajax In 2010, General Dynamics UK was awarded a contract to supply the British Army with a family of armoured fighting vehicles to meet the requirements of its Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) programme. As prime contractor, the company's bid centered around the General Dynamics Ajax armoured fighting vehicle (previously known as Scout SV), a development of the ASCOD armoured fighting vehicle which was co-developed by another General Dynamics subsidiary, the Spanish-based Santa B√°rbara Sistemas. A total of 589 vehicles were to be produced in six variants, including turreted Ajax armoured reconnaissance variants, Ares armoured personnel carrier variants, Athena command and control variants, Argus engineer reconnaissance variants, Atlas recovery variants and Apollo repair variants. Manufacturing and assembly of the first 100 vehicles took place in Spain using steel supplied from Sweden, something the British government argued was not a major loss for British industry as the work for the remaining 489 vehicles was to be carried out in the United Kingdom. Subsequently, in 2016, General Dynamics UK opened an assembly, integration and testing facility for Ajax at a former forklift truck factory in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales where work on the remaining 489 vehicles was to take place. The first variant of the Ajax family, the Ares, was delivered to the British Army in July 2020. In 2011, General Dynamics acquired Force Protection Inc and its UK-based subsidiary Force Protection Europe which had developed the Ocelot light protected vehicle, otherwise known as Foxhound in the British Army. General Dynamics UK subsequently oversaw the delivery of Foxhound to the British Army and continues marketing the product. In 2016, the UK Ministry of Defence awarded an Assessment Phase contract for its Challenger 2 Life Extension Project (LEP) to Team Challenger 2, a consortium of companies lead by BAE Systems which included General Dynamics Land Systems - UK. The company's Merthyr Tydfil facility was to be used to bring the Challenger 2 up to Mark 2 standard. In 2017, General Dynamics UK was awarded a ¬£330 million contract to supply the UK Ministry of Defence with tactical communication and information systems as part of its Morpheus programme. Overview General Dynamics UK Limited comprises two business units: General Dynamics Land Systems - UK and General Dynamics Mission Systems - UK.

Biography Born to a poor family in Kyiv in 1888, in what was then the Russian Empire, Goncharov was a choral singer in his youth. In 1907, he graduated from the Baltic Fleet Musical College, where he studied clarinet. During his time at the college, he received lessons in conducting, harmony, composition and orchestral score reading from the famed Russian composer Reinhold Gli√®re. He was later mentored by Alexander Koshetz. From 1907, he conducted the choirs of St Volodymyr's Cathedral and, later, Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev. Goncharov lost his sight due to illness in 1921, but remained active as a conductor and composer. He founded the Southwestern Railway Chorus, and also worked for the Kiev State Opera and the Ukrainian State Choir (DUMKA). In 1940, he moved to Lviv. There he became the conductor of the newly-founded and now famous Ukrainian Trembita Chorus, while simultaneously working for the Lviv Opera, conducting its choir and orchestra. In 1942, after the Nazi occupation of Kyiv, he returned there to again conduct the choir of St Volodymyr's Cathedral. Goncharov died in Kyiv in 1970, and was buried in Baikove Cemetery.  Works  Goncharov's two best known works are the liturgical works (\\"Liberation Service\\") and , known variously in English as \\"To Your Cross\\" and \\"Thy Cross We Worship\\", among other names. This latter is noteworthy in that it includes one of the lowest notes in the basso profondo range (C2). \\"To Your Cross\\" was used in the soundtracks of Chris Marker's 1962 film, La Jet√©e.

Mother Xavier was professed as a Sister of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Tasmania, Australia in 1883. In 1911, Mother Xavier Dooley became the first Superior of the amalgamated Hobart and Launceston Presentation Congregations. She died on 4 July 1929 in Launceston, Tasmania.  Early life  Eliza Dooley was the second daughter of the late Alice and James Monaghan Dooley, of Latrobe. Eliza spent several years as a boarder at the Presentation Convent, Hobart.  Religious life  In 1880 she entered the noviciate, of the Presentation Convent in Hobart; and in 1881 her Superior, Mother Xavier Murphy, sent her to Launceston. In the following year she was received as a novice, and in 1883 she made her religious profession in the Church of the Apostles. The popularity of the Convent Schools incited jealously in those who were afraid of their success. In the Launceston Examiner, 17 June 1887, Reverend Charles Price of the Tamar Street Congregational Church penned a slanderous letter about the Convent. This lead the Convent to file criminal application against Price for publication of a defamatory libel upon the Lady Superior and nuns of the Presentation Convent. Price withdraw his imputation and the case was dismissed. In 1896 Mother Xavier was chosen, along with Mother Bernard Moore, to open St. Columba's School in Launceston. She taught here until 1906 when she was elected Superior of the Launceston Presentation community. She was again re-elected in 1909 for another three years. During this time it was proposed that the Hobart community would join with the Launceston community, with one Superior for a Tasmanian Congregation. Launceston was recognized as the Mother House with the Novitiate, and Hobart was to be a filial formation. Mother Xavier Dooley as Superior in Launceston automatically became Superior of the first amalgamated Tasmanian Congregation. This change came into effect in 1911. After leaving the role of Superior, Mother Xavier Dooley went back to St. Columba School for a few years, and in 1923 she was transferred to St. Mary's School, where she worked until her death in 1929.

History of origins and performance  In 1883, Dvo≈ô√°k was invited to write a large orchestral oratorio for England to be performed at the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival. Dvo≈ô√°k had agreed with his librettist Marie ƒåervinkov√°-Riegrov√° to write an oratorio on a theme from Czech history, for example the story of St. Wenceslas or Jan Hus. Finally he decided to write a literary work, the ballad The Ghost Bride by Karel Jarom√≠r Erben. He worked on his composition from April to November 1884, and the cantata was published by Alfred Novello the following year.Die Geisterbraut : romantische Oper in zwei Abtheilungen und vier Aufz√ºgen on Library of Congress Before the performance in England, the cantata was first presented twice on 28 and 29 March 1885 in Pilsen under the composer's direction.

Early years  Gkikas Magiorkinis was born and raised in Piraeus and was an honors student at school, while receiving awards in the Hellenic National Contests of Physics (2nd award, 1997) and Chemistry (5th award, 1997). He was accepted at the Medical School of Athens University in 1997, having scored the highest marks in all of Greece in the Greek University Admission Exams.  Education  Magiorkinis graduated from Medical School in 2004 and then earned a Master of Science degree in Biostatistics. He carried out his PhD at the School of Medicine of Athens University and his thesis was titled ‚ÄúMolecular evolution of Human Viruses ‚Äì applications on molecular epidemiology\\". His medical training was completed with residencies in biopathology at three Athens hospitals, namely \\"Andreas Syngros\\", \\"Laiko\\" and \\"401 Army General Hospital\\".  Career  From 2010 to 2017 he was postdoctoral researcher (2010-2011), Marie-Curie Fellow (2011-2012), Medical Research Council Clinician Scientist Fellow (2013-2017) and University Research Lecturer (2014-2017) at Oxford University, while from 2013 to 2017 he served as Honorary Consultant in Medical Virology at the Virus Reference Department of Public Health England in Colindale, London. He then became a lecturer and subsequently assistant professor of Hygiene and Epidemiology in the Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Since 2020 he has served on the Ministry of Health's Committee of Experts on Public Health and he substitutes for professor Sotirios Tsiodras in the public briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic when Dr. Tsiodras is absent.  Distinctions = Awards  * 2012: \\"Marie Curie\\" Award in the category \\"Promising Research Talent\\" * 2011: \\"Ioannis Vlysidis\\" award, Athens Academy  Fellowships  Dr. Magiorkinis has been awarded several fellowships, the most important of which are: * Clinician Scientist Fellowship, Medical Research Council, United Kingdom * Junior Research Fellow, St. Cross College, University of Oxford * Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship, European Commission He is a member of the UK General Medical Council, the Medical Association of Athens, a fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists and the Royal Society of Medicine. Dr. Magiorkinis has over 60 publications in peer-reviewed journals, indicatively The New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet Infectious Diseases. International media have often featured Dr. Magiorkinis, indicatively The Washington Post, The Guardian, Euronews and others.  Criticism  In a post on his Facebook page on Saturday 29 August 2020, Dr. Magiorkinis used a diagram to show that a school classroom of 25 pupils is only 4% more of a hazard for the dispersion of SARS- CoV-2 than a classroom of 15 pupils. Moreover, he asserted that a solution involving smaller classes would pose a greater risk for educators, as it would mean nearly double exposure to possible infected cases. His opinion was widely questioned by educators, while at the same time contrasting opinions were being expressed by medical experts such as Professor of Epidemiology at Athens University Dr. Athena Linou and Professor of Genetics at Geneva University Dr. Manolis Dermitzakis. Dr. Dermitzakis explained his disagreement by replying to Dr. Magiorkinis that the model he used was wrong, as in a class of 25 pupils there is a higher probability of a child being SARS-CoV-2-positive, and additionally the child will potentially spread the virus to more individuals than in a 15-pupil class.
