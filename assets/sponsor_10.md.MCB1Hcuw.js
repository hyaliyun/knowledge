In 2006 in Madrid he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians. (published in vol. 2 of the Proceedings of the ICM, Madrid 2006, pages 813‚Äì826) Education and career In 1972 Mabuchi graduated from the University of Tokyo Faculty of Science and became a graduate student in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. (translated form the original Japanese by Hisashi Kobayashi) There he graduated with a Ph.D. in 1977 with thesis C3-Actions and Algebraic Threefolds with Ample Tangent Bundle and advisor Shoshichi Kobayashi As a postdoc Mabuchi was from 1977 to 1978 a guest researcher at the University of Bonn. Since 1978 he is a faculty member of the Department of Mathematics of Osaka University. His research deals with complex differential geometry, extremal K√§hler metrics, stability of algebraic varieties, and the Hitchin‚ÄìKobayashi correspondence. In 2006 Toshiki Mabuchi and Takashi Shioya received the Geometry Prize of the Mathematical Society of Japan. Research contributions Mabuchi is well-known for his introduction, in 1986, of the Mabuchi energy, which gives a variational interpretation to the problem of K√§hler metrics of constant scalar curvature. In particular, the Mabuchi energy is a real-valued function on a K√§hler class whose Euler-Lagrange equation is the constant scalar curvature equation. In the case that the K√§hler class represents the first Chern class of the complex manifold, one has a relation to the K√§hler-Einstein problem, due to the fact that constant scalar curvature metrics in such a K√§hler class must be K√§hler-Einstein. Owing to the second variation formulas for the Mabuchi energy, every critical point is stable. Furthermore, if one integrates a holomorphic vector field and pulls back a given K√§hler metric by the corresponding one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms, then the corresponding restriction of the Mabuchi energy is a linear function of one real variable; its derivative is the Futaki invariant discovered a few years earlier by Akito Futaki.A. Futaki. An obstruction to the existence of Einstein K√§hler metrics. Invent. Math. 73 (1983), no. 3, 437‚Äì443. The Futaki invariant and Mabuchi energy are fundamental in understanding obstructions to the existence of K√§hler metrics which are Einstein or which have constant scalar curvature. A year later, by use of the -lemma, Mabuchi considered a natural Riemannian metric on a K√§hler class, which allowed him to define length, geodesics, and curvature; the sectional curvature of Mabuchi's metric is nonpositive. Along geodesics in the K√§hler class, the Mabuchi energy is convex. So the Mabuchi energy has strong variational properties.

(See: 7e R√©giment de Chasseurs √† Cheval)  Formation  The Picardie Chasseurs traces its origins to the Compagnies Franches de Volontaires Royaux (French Company of Royal Volunteers), formed by ordnance on 15 August 1745. At the time of formation, these new companies were dispersed throughout France, but most concentrated in Flanders. It wasn't until 1747 these companies were grouped together under a single Mestre de camp (Master of Camp), and became the Volontaires Royaux. They served in the County of Nice as the War of the Austrian Succession heated up, and would remain for another year until the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.Susane, Cavalry II, Part II, pp. 96‚Äì101.  Seven Years' War  Dragoon uniform of the Legion in 1768, along with the infantry maintains the blue jacket of the royal regiments.Regimental uniform in 1788. In 1757, they formed the vanguard for the Army of Marshal Louis Charles, Duc d'Estr√©es, and took Rietberg by force and took some 1,200 prisoners. They then found themselves at the Battle of Hastenbeck where the French implemented a serious defeat upon the allied army, leading to the occupation of Hanover. They then were placed in Hoya for winter-quarters and were attacked there on 23 February 1758 by superior forces, but they made a vigorous defence, and fought until they were forced to retire from the castle. Eventually, they were relieved by the R√©giment des Gardes‚ÄìLorraine, two pickets from Brittany and some 100 dragoons from the R√©giment de Mastre de Camp Dragons, and obtained the honours of war there. As a direct result of this engagement, the volunteers were granted a patenet on 7 May to become the L√©gion Royale (Royal Legion), expanded its establishment, and roles.Infantryman of the Legion in 1768, in the distinctive royal blue jacket.The legion was now organised into 12 companies, each of; 100 men; 60 of infantry and 40 of dragoons, a company of hussars, a company of workers (logistics), company of pioneers (engineers), and a company of pontonniers (bridging troops). In 1759 it was again expanded to 2 companies of grenadiers, 12 mixed companies of 75 infantry and 50 dragoons, 2 companies of hussars, and 1 company of supporting staff (logistics, engineers, and bridging troops). By this time, the regimental uniform consisted of; a blue coat, red collar, cuffs, jacket and linings, white breeches, white buttons on both sides of the garment and jacket, three-button cross pockets, bearskin for grenadiers, and black tricorne for the infantry, and the hussars, hat edged with silver for the dragoons. The colours of the legion during this time are unknown, but it is assumed it was the royal blue with silver/white trimming, as used by all royal troops. The 1758 campaign finished with the regiment in Cr√©feld and served in the Battle of L√ºzelberg, which it has especially distinguished itself. The regiment distinguished itself hey again on 6 June 1759 at the Battle of Eberfeld, where it saved a battalion of the R√©giment de Provence, and again served at the Battle of Minden. It was in 1760 at the Battle of Corbach and Battle of B√ºlow, and later in the Battle of Ramem, where it contributed brilliantly to the defence of General B√ºlow, who lots his guns and ammunition. In 1760, it was at the Battle of Kloster Kampen and continued to serve in Germany until the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Towards the end of the war, the establishment of the legion had slightly changed to become; 1 company of grenadiers, 8 companies of fusiliers (foot), 8 companies of dragoons (mounted), and the uniform slightly modified. The new uniform became, for dragoons; uniform was blue edged with a white braid edged with a red stripe on each side. In 1766, the lining, the jacket, and the breeches were all white, the collar, the facings, and the lapels all red.  Peacetime  In 1766, the regiment joined the garrison in Huningue, in 1764 to Annonay, in 1766 to Givet, in 1767 to Saint-Hippolyte, in 1768 to Tournon, in 1769 to Corsica and served during the French Conquest of Corsica, then in 1770 to Bar-le-Duc, in 1771 to Lesneven in Brittany, in 1772 in Mouzon, in 1775 to Sarreguemines. Under the 1776 reformations, the legion's 8 infantry companies were separated to the infantry regiments to form their new Companie des ChasseursCompany of Chasseurs (Light Infantry), and the 8 dragoon companies transformed into 4 squadrons of chasseurs √† chevalMounted Chasseurs (Hunters), and attached to the four senior dragoon regiments. In 1778, a new ordnance was published and the chasseurs √† cheval companies removed from the dragoons to form a new designated chasseurs regiment. Shortly after, on 20 January 1779, the 1er R√©giment des Chasseurs √† Cheval was formed in Besan√ßon from these companies, and continued the lineage of the Royal Legion. In 1780, the regiment moved to Jussey, and in 1781 to Besan√ßon again, in 1782 to Sarreguemines, in 1784 to Ancenis, in 1787 to Landrecies and in 1788 to Lorient and Port-Louis with a detachment in Douai.Smith, Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 49. The ordnance of 8 May 1784 formed six battalions of Chasseurs √† PiedLiterally \\"Hunters of Foot\\"., each of four companies and attached each battalion to a regiment of Chasseurs √† Cheval, to form a light tactical brigade used for reconnaissance and rear-guards. The battalion of the Chasseurs des Alpes was formed that year, and thus attached to the 1er Chasseurs √† Cheval, and after grouping the mounted element became the Chasseurs √† Cheval des Alpes. This grouping only lasted a couple years, as on 17 March 1788 both were separated to form the Chasseurs Bretons (infantry) and Chasseurs √† Cheval de Picardie (cavalry) and became affiliated with the Picardie region, and based in Haguenau.  Revolution  After the revolution, on 1 January 1791 all provincial and royal titles were ended, and the regiment became the 7√©me R√©giment de Chasseurs. After the regiment's renaming, the royalist lineage was ended.Phipps, pp. 20‚Äì22.

County of San Diego, 820 P.2d 1000 (Cal. 1991) was a California Supreme Court case where the court ruled that a sales tax in San Diego County, California to fund courthouses and jails was invalid, because it failed to reach a two-thirds voter approval as required by Proposition 13. Background In 1978, California voters passed Proposition 13, an amendment (article XIII-A) to the California Constitution that limited the ways that state and local governments could create new taxes. Specifically, section 4 of article XIII-A required the approval of two thirds of voters for \\"special taxes\\" proposed by cities, counties, and entities called \\"special districts.\\" Seeking additional funding for jails and courthouses, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors in 1985 sought to create a county fund for managing and operating such facilities. However, in the November 1986 election, only 51 percent of county voters approved the fund, well short of a two-thirds requirement for passage as required by Proposition 13. Subsequently, the California State Legislature passed the San Diego County Regional Justice Facility Financing Act in 1987, which was introduced by Assemblymember Larry Stirling (Republican of San Diego), that created the seven-member San Diego County Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency, an agency responsible for creating Proposition A, a sales tax of 0.5 percent in San Diego County that would fund the construction of courthouses and jails. In June 1988, the sales tax won with 50.8 percent approval of county voters. The San Diego County sales tax rose to 7 percent. Procedural history Following the June 1988 election, Richard J. Rider and other San Diego County taxpayers filed a lawsuit that challenged the legality of the tax and alleged that the sales tax violated the requirements of a supermajority vote to pass taxes from Proposition 13 (1978) and Proposition 62 (1986). Judge Gordon Burkhart of the Riverside County Superior Court ruled in the plaintiffs' favor on March 23, 1989. The judge ruled that the sales tax was a \\"special tax\\" as defined by Proposition 13 because the tax was not for general use but specifically for judicial facilities. However, on September 4, 1990, the California Court of Appeal overturned the superior court decision. The appeals court ruled that because the Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency was not empowered to pass property taxes, that agency was not a \\"special district\\" as defined by Proposition 13. The Supreme Court of California heard the case on October 9, 1991. By that month, San Diego County raised over $320 million from the sales tax but was unable to spend the money pending the outcome of the Rider case. Decision The California Supreme Court issued the 5‚Äì2 decision ruling against the sales tax on December 19, 1991, saying that any entity that is \\"essentially controlled\\" by a county or city must follow the two-thirds requirement for special taxes. Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Armand Arabian, Marvin R. Baxter, and Ronald M. George. The justices wrote in their majority opinion: Additionally, Justice George wrote a separate, concurring opinion writing in part: Giving separate dissents were Justices Stanley Mosk and Joyce L. Kennard. Mosk gave the opinion that the majority opinion broke away from past precedent. Kennard wrote that the San Diego agency that proposed the sales tax \\"is not a special district subject to the provisions of section 4 of article XIII A of the California Constitution and that the majority's interpretation of the phrase \\"special taxes\\" is overbroad.\\" Aftermath Nearly a week after the court decision, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted on December 30, 1991 to continue collecting the Proposition A sales tax, and Chief Justice Lucas signed an order denying a request by the Libertarian Party to stop collection of the sales tax. In January 1992, a Los Angeles Times poll found that 68 percent of San Diego city residents believed that a sales tax was needed to improve jails and courthouses and that 64 percent supported allowing the county to restore the sales tax. On February 13, 1992, the California Supreme Court declined to review this decision. As a result, Proposition A was abolished, and the sales tax rate in San Diego County dropped from 8.25 to 7.75 percent. Rider says that this case reduced taxes by $3.5 billion in San Diego County and $14 billion statewide.https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/people/richard-rider References ;Works cited * ;Notes Category:Supreme Court of California case law Category:United States taxation and revenue case law ","title":"Rider v.

Volume list=Reception and impact Christopher Kinsey of Anime Outsider assessed the series as possessing \\"a penchant for dick jokes before dick jokes became one of the internet's most depreciated currencies,\\" and praised its satirization of traditional manga narratives. During its initial serialization in Pulp, Warren Ellis cited Heartbroken Angels as \\"amongst the best things currently being published in the English language\\".

Description Philotheca obovatifolia is a shrub that grows to a height of about and has glandular-warty branchlets. The leaves are densely clustered near the ends of the branchlets and are broadly egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, wide with a prominent midrib on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to five on a conspicuous peduncle up to long, each flower on a pedicel long. There are five triangular sepals and five elliptic to oblong cream-coloured petals long, wide and tinged with pink. The ten stamens are hairy. Flowering occurs in late spring and the fruit is about long with a beak about long. Taxonomy and naming This philotheca was first formally described in 1998 by Michael J. Bayly who gave it the name Philotheca myoporoides subsp. obovatifolia and published the description in the journal Muelleria. In 2005 Paul Irwin Forster raised the subspecies to species status as Philotheca obovatifolia in the journal Austrobaileya.

Primarily used as a pejorative, it is sometimes linked to an intolerance of differing opinions, cancel culture, \\"wokeness\\", \\"social justice warriors\\", and the far left; Yang himself describes it bluntly as \\"authoritarian Utopianism that masquerades as liberal humanism while usurping it from within\\". Roger Berkowitz has linked the \\"successor ideology\\" to a broader retreat of liberalism worldwide, arguing that liberalism is being simultaneously challenged from the left in the form of the \\"successor ideology\\" and the right in the form of illiberal democracy. Origins The term was coined by political writer Wesley Yang in a 4 March 2019 tweet discussing affirmative action; Yang stated, \\"This successor ideology has been a rival to the meritocratic one and has in recent years acquired sufficient power to openly seek hegemony on campuses and elsewhere\\". He expanded on the term in further tweets in May 2019. It slowly gained recognition among other political writers, and saw a surge of articles discussing it in summer 2020. Criticism Sarah Jeong, writing in The Verge, has argued that there is no such thing as a 'successor ideology', saying the term \\"seems to only muddy the waters since the thing that [critics of the 'successor ideology'] are concerned about isn‚Äôt actually a concrete ideology but an inchoate social force with the hallmarks of religious revival\\". She also takes issue with what she claims are the term's reactionary connotations, viewing it as a way to defend an \\"old paradigm\\" that \\"[breeds] an irrational and incomprehensibly unjust society\\" which \\"tolerate[s] the intolerant and treat[s] dehumanization as a difference of opinion\\". Political writer Osita Nwanevu has likewise argued that the successor ideology is a reactionary concept. He further contends that, counter to the narrative that the 'successor ideology' is fundamentally illiberal, it is actually those who are identified with it who are \\"protecting‚Äîindeed expanding‚Äîthe bounds of liberalism\\", while it those who oppose it‚Äîthe \\"reactionaries\\"‚Äîwho are \\"most guilty of the illiberalism they claim has overtaken the American Left\\".

Until 2009, the March of Tolerance was organized by the Culture for Tolerance Foundation (Fundacja Kultura dla Tolerancji) together with other LGBT organizations, as part of the annual Krak√≥w Gay and Lesbian Culture Festival \\"Culture for Tolerance\\" (Kultura dla Tolerancji). The first parade took place in May 2004. About 1200 people took part in it. Since 2009, an informal organizing committee for the May Queer Festival has been organized by the LGBTQ organizations in Krak√≥w and private individuals. Since 2010 it has been held under the Equality March in Krakow name (Marsz R√≥wno≈õci w Krakowie). The March of Tolerance arouses opposition from conservative circles, especially from the far-right and ultranationalist groups. It was always accompanied by a counter-meeting organized by All-Polish Youth on the same day.  History  2019 Equality March The first March of Tolerance took place on 7 May 2004. In addition to the march itself, a scientific conference organized in cooperation with the Institute of Sociology of the Jagiellonian University, a visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum and paying tribute to homosexuals-victims of Nazism, as well as screenings of LGBT films, took place during the festival. Some right-wing and ultra-conservative organizations tried to put pressure on the rector of the University as well as on the city authorities to prevent the planned events, especially the March of Tolerance. About 1,200 people took part in the event. In 2005, due to the death of Pope John Paul II, the organizers decided to cancel the March of Tolerance. In 2006 the March of Tolerance took place on April 28th. About 2000 people took part in the demonstration. At the same time, the All-Polish Youth organized a counter-meeting of the March of Tradition and Culture. Under the Philharmonic, the March of Tolerance was attacked by several hundred hooligans. At Wawel Castle they tried to block the march. The police detained 11 of the most aggressive hooligans, several dozen people were punished with fines. One participant of the March of Tolerance was injured by a stone hit on the head. The Third March of Tolerance took place on 21 April 2007. According to police estimates, about 2000 people took part in it. The participants of the counter-meeting tried to disrupt the course of the March of Tolerance many times, throwing eggs at the demonstrators and erecting homophobic shouts and banners and blocking the route of the march. They also tried to tear up the rainbow flags. A total of 13 of the most aggressive participants of the counter-meeting were detained. Among them were five minors, including two 16-year-olds, who were found with pyrotechnic materials. The Fourth March of Tolerance took place on 26 April 2008. When the March of Tolerance reached the Market Square, its participants released several hundred colorful balloons. Then eggs and bottles thrown by the counter-enthusiasts flew towards the march participants and the police. At the same time, groups of opponents chanted offensive slogans. According to police estimates, the March of Tolerance was attended by about 1,000 people (from 600 to 1,000 according to various sources), with about 400 opponents. Six people were detained (including one man for an active assault on an officer). None of the participants of the March of Tolerance was harmed. The march was condemned by the Krakow Metropolitan Curia of the Catholic Church. The fifth March of Tolerance, for the first time separated from the Culture for Tolerance Festival, took place on May 16, 2009 as part of the newly established Queer May Festival. The next manifestation took place on Saturday 15 May 2010 under a changed name. About 400 people took part in it. In 2011, the March took place on 21 May. Other LGBT marches have progressed more peacefully.

The cucumber is found in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific ocean. The species is vulnerable to over-exploitation from commercial fishing. It was first formally named by Gustave Cherbonnier in 1980. Distribution and habitat Holothuria fuscogilva are found in the Indo-Pacific ocean in shallow waters near islands and around coral reefs. Juvenile cucumbers live in shallower waters (such as inter-tidal zones) and then migrate to deeper waters as they mature. Spawning occurs during the Northeastern Monsoon season (October to December), and the species reaches sexually maturity relatively late. Description Adult cucumbers weigh between 2.4 and 4 kilograms. They are oval in shape and have a firm texture. This species cucumber has lateral papillae (teats) which are often buried in the sand. Conservation Holothuria fuscogilva is consumed as a food and is part of a large commercial fishery across its range. The cucumber can be collected by hand using a diving suit or while skin diving, allowing for it to be easily harvested. Due to overfishing, the cucumber was listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 2010. A large population of the cucumber formerly existed in Sri Lanka, but decades of overfishing and mismanagement caused a large decline in the species' numbers.

The American Civil War began in 1861 with the Battle of Fort Sumter, and fighting soon escalated. Beginning in May, events in the state of Missouri led to an expansion of the war into that state. In 1862, Confederate recruiting activities occurred in the state, and a cavalry regiment was formed in Oregon County. On September 2, the unit entered Confederate service, but was soon reclassified as infantry. After many of the unit's men transferred to other units, the regiment was reclassified as a battalion and named the 7th Missouri Infantry Battalion. Under the name Mitchell's Missouri Infantry, the unit was part of a Confederate offensive at the Battle of Prairie Grove on December 7. During the battle, the unit made several charges against Union lines, but was repeatedly repulsed by artillery fire. The regiment spent most of early 1863 encamped near Little Rock and Pine Bluff in Arkansas, and may have been part of an expedition to the Mississippi River. On July 23, the unit was officially named the 8th Missouri Infantry Regiment. Later that year, it was part of the abortive Confederate defense of Little Rock before retiring to Camp Bragg near Camden. In March 1864, the regiment was sent south into Louisiana to help defend against the Red River campaign. It was then part of a failed attack at the Battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9. After the Union troops involved in the Red River campaign retreated, the 8th Missouri Infantry was then sent back to Arkansas, where it pursued a retreating Union column led by Major General Frederick Steele. The regiment was then part of a failed attack against Steele on April 30 at the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry. For the remainder of 1864 and the first half of 1865, the unit was stationed at various points in Louisiana and Arkansas. The Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered on June 2, 1865, and the 8th Missouri Infantry Regiment was paroled on June 7, ending its combat career. Background and formation In the United States during the early 19th century, a large cultural divide developed between the northern states and the southern states over the issue of slavery. By the time of the 1860 United States Presidential Election, slavery had become one of the defining features of southern culture, with the ideology of states' rights being used to defend the institution. Eventually, many southerners decided that secession was the only way to preserve slavery, especially after Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860. The election was decided largely along regional lines, as much of Lincoln's support was from the northern states, while he received no electoral votes from the Deep South. Many southerners rejected the legitimacy of Lincoln's election, and promoted secession. On December 20, the state of South Carolina seceded, and the states of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed suit in early 1861. On February 4, the seceding states formed the Confederate States of America; Jefferson Davis became the nascent nation's president. In Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, the important military installation of Fort Sumter was still held by a Union Army garrison. On the morning of April 12, the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, beginning the American Civil War. The fort surrendered on the 13th. Shortly after Fort Sumter was attacked, Lincoln requested that the states remaining in the Union provide 75,000 volunteers for the war effort. In the coming weeks, the states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas joined the Confederacy. Map of key points in Missouri, including Jefferson City, Boonville, and Carthage Meanwhile, the state of Missouri was politically divided. The state legislature voted against secession, but Governor Claiborne F. Jackson supported it. Jackson decided to mobilize the state militia to a point outside of St. Louis, where the St. Louis Arsenal was located. Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon, the commander of the arsenal, moved to disperse the militiamen on May 10 in the Camp Jackson affair; a pro-secession riot in St. Louis followed. In turn, Jackson created the Missouri State Guard as a new militia organization on May 12, appointing Major General Sterling Price as the organization's commander. When it became obvious that there would be no peaceable compromise, Lyon moved against the state capital of Jefferson City, ejecting Jackson and the pro-secession elements of the state legislature on June 15; the Missouri State Guard and the pro-secession legislators withdrew to southwestern Missouri. Lyon pursued the secessionists, and Price was eventually joined by Confederate States Army troops commanded by Brigadier General Ben McCulloch, who commanded the combined force. On August 10, Lyon attacked the mixed camp near Wilsons Creek. The ensuing Battle of Wilson's Creek was envisioned as a pincer attack, but Lyon was killed and his men routed; the Union troops retreated all the way to Rolla after the defeat. Price followed up the victory at Wilson's Creek by driving north towards the Missouri River. On September 13, the Missouri State Guard encountered Union troops near Lexington; the city was soon placed under siege. On September 20, the Union garrison surrendered, ending the Siege of Lexington. However, Union pressure soon led Price to withdraw back to southwestern Missouri. On November 3, Jackson and the pro-secession elements of the state legislature voted to secede and join the Confederate States of America as a government-in-exile; the anti-secession elements of the legislature had previously voted against secession. In February 1862, Major General Samuel R. Curtis began pressuring Price's position in Springfield, leading Price to abandon Missouri for Arkansas. On March 7 and 8, Price, McCulloch, and Major General Earl Van Dorn were defeated by Curtis at the Battle of Pea Ridge, giving the Union Army control of Missouri. However, later that year, the Confederates reestablished some presence in Missouri through guerrilla activities and recruiting efforts. On August 7, former veterans of the Missouri State Guard began forming a cavalry unit in Oregon County, Missouri. The unit then officially entered Confederate service on September 2, while it was stationed at Evening Shade, Arkansas. Despite entering service as a cavalry unit, Major General Theophilus Holmes, the commander of the Trans- Mississippi Department, ordered that the unit be converted to infantry on September 12. That same month, the regiment was presented with a war flag of the first Confederate national flag pattern. However, the regiment lost many men due to transfers to other units, necessitating the consolidation of the regiment into six companies and a reclassification as a battalion on October 19. Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Mitchell commanded the unit. Service history=1862 Map of key points in Arkansas, including Van Buren, Little Rock, and Pine Bluff On October 27, the battalion, officially designated the 7th Missouri Infantry Battalion, began moving towards Fort Smith, Arkansas, where a Confederate army was being organized. The unit did not reach the camp of Brigadier General Mosby M. Parsons, to whose brigade the battalion was assigned, until November 28. One day later, three companies from Frazier's Missouri Infantry Battalion were added to the 7th Missouri Infantry Battalion; the combined unit was still considered a battalion. When Parsons moved northward in the direction of Prairie Grove on December 3, the battalion accompanied the brigade. Four days later, Parsons' brigade saw action at the Battle of Prairie Grove. Early in the fighting, Parsons' brigade was aligned in a position guarding the Confederate left, along with Brigadier General John S. Roane's brigade. The 7th Missouri Infantry Battalion, known as Mitchell's Missouri Infantry during the battle, served as Parsons' reserve. Later in the fighting, Parsons' brigade counterattacked Union troops from Brigadier General James G. Blunt's division. Parsons moved Mitchell's unit to the left of his line under the belief that his flank was endangered. Later, Roane detached Clark's Missouri Infantry from his brigade, sending it to Parsons; it was then aligned on Mitchell's left. Fire from the 1st Kansas Battery slowed the momentum of the Confederate attack, but the weight of Confederate numbers eventually drove the Union line back. Advancing to the new Union line, Mitchell and Clark outflanked the 10th Kansas Infantry Regiment, but again ran into the 1st Kansas Battery. Two salvos of canister halted Mitchell's and Clark's attack, but Parsons' right drove Blunt's line back, leading the troops in front of Mitchell to withdraw. Clark and Mitchell attempted to follow up with another attack, but this was quickly driven off by the 1st Kansas Battery and the 10th and 13th Kansas Infantry Regiments. Mitchell's unit had taken 450 men into Prairie Grove; 20 of them became casualties. That night, the Confederates retreated from the field, eventually reaching Van Buren, Arkansas. On December 23, elements of Frazier's Missouri Infantry Battalion were cobbled together to form a tenth company; with ten companies, the unit could again be called a regiment. The ten companies were made up with recruits from Missouri and were designated with the letters AI and K. Mitchell was the unit's colonel, John S. Smizer was its lieutenant colonel, and W. H. L. Frazier, the former commander of Frazier's Missouri Infantry Battalion, was its major. 1863 In early 1863, Parsons' brigade was transferred to Little Rock, Arkansas. However, before reaching its destination, Mitchell's Missouri Infantry Regiment was reassigned to Colonel John Bullock Clark Jr.'s brigade. After reaching Little Rock, the regiment transitioned to winter quarters. The regiment moved again, this time on February 7, to a point known as White's Bluff via steamboat. Less than a month later, it was sent to Fort Pleasant, which was a military installation on the Arkansas River near Pine Bluff. On June 12, Clark's brigade left Fort Pleasant to begin an expedition to the Mississippi River, with the purpose of harassing Union Navy shipping. While the historian James McGhee states that Mitchell's regiment did not take part in the campaign, instead remaining at Fort Pleasant, the Encyclopedia of Arkansas states that the regiment was engaged in a skirmish near Gaines' Landing on the Mississippi on June 28. Eathan Allen Pinnell, a member of the regiment, wrote a diary entry on July 5 stating that the regiment had left Fort Pleasant for the first time in 127 days. On July 23, the Confederate States War Department gave Mitchell's regiment the designation of the 8th Missouri Infantry Regiment. Later that year, Clark's brigade was transferred from Fort Pleasant back to Little Rock, in order to build fortifications around the city. Union Major General Frederick Steele was threatening the Confederate defenses, but outflanked the fortifications, leveraging the Confederates out of Little Rock on September 10 without a fight. Clark's brigade retreated to Camp Bragg, which was in the vicinity of Camden. The regiment engaged in no noteworthy actions during the remainder of 1863, and performed only routine camp duty. 18641865 Jenkins' Ferry battlefield Early in 1864, Union Major General Nathaniel Banks drove a force up the Red River with the intent of capturing Shreveport, Louisiana; this offensive constituted the Red River campaign. The 8th Missouri Infantry was then sent into Louisiana to reinforce the Confederates under the command of Major General Richard Taylor who were resisting Banks. By the second half of March, Clark's brigade had reached the Shreveport vicinity. On March 25, by order of the Trans-Mississippi Department, Parsons was elevated to division command; Clark's brigade became part of the new division. The division left Shreveport on April 3 to join Taylor, and was engaged in the Battle of Pleasant Hill six days later. At the opening of the fighting, Parsons' division held the right of the main Confederate line, with Clark's brigade on the right and Colonel Simon P. Burns' brigade on the left. A small cavalry force was positioned to the right of Parsons, although that force's purpose was to exploit a potential breakthrough, rather than participate in the planned Confederate attack. Parsons' division, as well as that of Brigadier General James Camp Tappan, hit Colonel Lewis Benedict's Union brigade, shattering it in the process. However, the 58th Illinois Infantry Regiment counterattacked, driving back part of the Confederate right flank. Additional Union units reentered the fray, and the Confederate right was forced to retreat. While the withdrawal was initially orderly, Parsons' and Tappan's divisions became panicked as night fell, and it became a rout. The Confederates to the left of Parsons and Tappan had failed to make any meaningful progress against Union breastworks, and the battle ended with nightfall. Banks could claim victory, as he had repulsed the Confederate attacks, but after consulting his subordinates, he decided to withdraw back to Grand Ecore. This decision was made in part because some of Banks' subordinates had lost confidence in him earlier in the campaign; one had even briefly entertained ideas of a mutiny. The 8th Missouri Infantry suffered 76 casualties at Pleasant Hill, including 16 fatalities. Meanwhile, in Arkansas, Steele occupied Camden on April 15. With Banks out of the way, General Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, prepared to concentrate his forces against Steele. The Union forces in Camden began running low on food, and two expeditions intended to forage food from the countryside were defeated at the Battles of Poison Spring and Marks' Mills. With little food remaining and in the knowledge that Banks had retreated, Steele's command left Camden on April 26 with hopes of reaching Little Rock. Smith pursued, and caught up with Steele at the crossing of the Saline River on April 30. The Confederates then attacked, bringing on the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry. Parsons' division arrived on the field at 09:00, but did not fully deploy until 10:00, with Burns on the left and Clark on the right. As Parsons' division moved forward to attack, it was joined by Colonel Lucien C. Gause's brigade, which was to align with Clark. The two brigades, despite maneuvering through thick mud, advanced close to the Union line while being supported by Ruffner's Missouri Battery and Lesueur's Missouri Battery. Clark and Gause assaulted the Union line at a point held by the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry Regiment. The fighting was relatively even until another Union regiment arrived, which poured enfilade fire into the Confederates' ranks. At this point, the brigades of Clark and Gause broke, leaving the batteries unsupported. The 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry then attacked the guns, capturing three of them. Further Confederate attacks were defeated, and Steele was able to escape across the Saline, reaching Little Rock on May 2. At Jenkins' Ferry, the 8th Missouri Infantry suffered 29 casualties, including seven men killed. Jenkins' Ferry was the regiment's last major action; it spent the rest of the war at various camps in Arkansas and Louisiana. On June 2, 1865, Smith signed surrender terms for the Trans-Mississippi District. Five days later, the survivors of the 8th Missouri Infantry were paroled; the men were later shipped back to Missouri via steamboat. Over the course of its combat career, 166 men died while serving in the regiment: 25 combat-related deaths and 141 deaths from disease.

Child Development Perspectives, 2015. 9(3): p. 138-143.. It is a fundamental and basic trait found in many organisms and is crucial because it enables an individual to adapt to different environmental conditions. Levels of Environmental Sensitivity often vary considerably from individual to individual, with some being more and others less sensitive to the same conditions. Such differences have been observed across many species such as pumpkinseed Ô¨Åsh, zebra Ô¨Ånches, mice, non- human primates and humans, indicating that there is a biological basis to differences in sensitivity. Several psychological theories have been developed to explore and explain the differences (see below) and recently, these theories have been integrated by Prof Michael Pluess into a broader framework under the umbrella term of Environmental Sensitivity. Detailed information on sensitivity, including self-tests, are provided at the researcher-led website at sensitivityresearch.com.  Theoretical background  The concept of Environmental Sensitivity integrates multiple theories on how people respond to negative and positive experiences. These include the frameworks of Diathesis-stress modelMonroe, S.M. and A.D. Simons, Diathesis-stress theories in the context of life stress research: implications for the depressive disorders. Psychol Bull, 1991. 110(3): p. 406-25. and Vantage SensitivityPluess, M. and J. Belsky, Vantage sensitivity: Individual differences in response to positive experiences.

Aron, Sensory-processing sensitivity and its relation to introversion and emotionality. J Pers Soc Psychol, 1997. 73(2): p. 345-68. (see Figure 1 for an illustration of the different models). These will be described briefly in turn, before presenting the integrative theory of Environmental Sensitivity in more detail. Figure 1. Illustration of the different models describing individual differences in Environmental Sensitivity: Diathesis-Stress (1.1) describes variability in response to adverse exposures, and Vantage Sensitivity (1.2) variability in response to supportive exposures, whereas the remaining three models Differential Susceptibility (1.3), Biological Sensitivity to Context (1.4), and Sensory Processing Sensitivity (1.5) describe individual differences in response to both negative and positive experiences. Consequently, Models 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 reflect the combination of Models 1.1 and 1.2.  Diathesis-Stress  According to the long-standing Diathesis-stress model, people differ in their response to adverse experiences and environments, with some individuals more negatively affected by environmental stressors than others . The model proposes that such differences in response result from the presence of ‚Äúvulnerability‚Äù factors, which include psychological (e.g., impulsive personality), physiological (e.g., high physiologically reactivity) and genetic factors (e.g., genetic variation in the serotonin transporter [5-HTTLPR short allele]). In other words, the model suggests that individuals carrying certain vulnerability factors are at greater risk of developing problems when exposed to adverse environments. While the Diathesis-stress model is helpful in understanding differences in response to negative stressors, it does not consider or describe differences in response to positive experiences.  Vantage Sensitivity  The Vantage Sensitivity framework was developed in 2013 by Michael Pluess and Jay Belsky to describe individual differences in response to positive experiences and environments. While some people appear to benefit particularly strongly from positive experiences (e.g., positive parenting, supportive relationships, psychological interventions), others appear to benefit less . Although a relatively new concept, a growing number of studies provides evidence to support the framework. While the Vantage Sensitivity framework considers individual differences in response to positive experiences, it does not make predictions about the response to negative experiences.  Differential Susceptibility  Differential Susceptibility, proposed by Jay Belsky, brings the differential responses to both positive and negative experiences together in one single model. Grounded in evolutionary theory, Belsky and colleagues sought to understand why and how children differ so fundamentally in their developmental response to external influences, with some being more and others less susceptible . Importantly, the theory finds that more susceptible individuals are not only more negatively affected by adverse experiences (as described in the Diathesis-stress model) but also particularly positively affected by the presence of favourable conditions (as described in the Vantage Sensitivity model). According to empirical studies, Differential Susceptibility is associated with various genetic, physiological and psychological factors, some of which are described below (see Empirical Evidence). Although early research suggested that differences in individuals‚Äô susceptibility are rooted in genetic factors, more recent research has shown that susceptibility is also influenced by prenatal and early postnatal environmental factors.  Biological Sensitivity to Context  The theory of Biological Sensitivity to Context by Tom Boyce and Bruce Ellis is based on evolutionary thinking and proposes that an individual‚Äôs sensitivity to the environment is shaped by the quality of early life experiences . For example, particularly negative or especially positive childhood environments are understood to predict greater physiological reactivity later in life. In contrast, sensitivity is expected to be lowest for individuals with childhood environments that were neither extremely beneficial nor extremely adverse.  Sensory Processing Sensitivity  Sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) theory by Elaine N. Aron and Arthur Aron proposes that sensitivity is a stable human trait characterized by greater awareness of sensory stimulation, behavioural inhibition, deeper cognitive processing of environmental stimuli, and higher emotional and physiological reactivity. According to this theory, approximately 20% of people fall into the category of a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP), in contrast to the remaining 80% who are considered less sensitive. Furthermore, the theory suggests that the sensitivity trait is adaptive from an evolutionary perspective, and regards differences in sensitivity as genetically determined and expressed via a more sensitive central nervous system.  Environmental Sensitivity  The broad theory of Environmental Sensitivity. integrates all of the listed frameworks and proposes that although all people are sensitive to their environment, some individuals tend to be more sensitive than others. Furthermore, the theory of Environmental Sensitivity suggests that people vary in their sensitivity to the environment due to differences in their ability to perceive and process information about the environment. In other words, more sensitive individuals are characterised by heightened perception as well as deeper processing of external information due to neurobiological differences in the central nervous system, which are influenced by genetic as well as environmental factors. The integrative perspective of Environmental Sensitivity further proposes that whilst some individuals are more sensitive to both negative and positive experiences, others may be particularly vulnerable to adverse experiences (but not very sensitive to positive ones), whilst some may be especially responsive to positive exposure (but not vulnerable to negative ones).  Empirical evidence for individual differences in sensitivity  Differences in sensitivity have been studied in relation to a wide range of sensitivity markers, such as genetic, physiological and psychological ones. These are now discussed in turn.  Genetic markers of sensitivity  A growing number of studies provide empirical evidence to support individual differences in sensitivity at the genetic level. These include traditional Gene-environment interaction studies featuring Candidate genes Bakermans-Kranenburg, M.J. and M.H. van IJzendoorn, Differential susceptibility to rearing environment depending on dopamine-related genes: new evidence and a meta-analysis. Development and Psychopathology, 2011. 23(1): p. 39-52.Schlomer, G.L., et al., Extending Previous cGxI Findings on 5-HTTLPR's Moderation of Intervention Effects on Adolescent Substance Misuse Initiation. Child Dev, 2017. 88(6): p. 2001-2012., as well as more recent genome-wide approaches Keers, R., et al., A Genome-Wide Test of the Differential Susceptibility Hypothesis Reveals a Genetic Predictor of Differential Response to Psychological Treatments for Child Anxiety Disorders. Psychotherapy and psychosomatics, 2016. 85(3): p. 146-158.. As an example for the latter, Keers et al.Keers, R., et al., A genome-wide test of the differential susceptibility hypothesis reveals a genetic predictor of differential response to psychological treatments for child anxiety disorders. Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, 2016. created a polygenic score for Environmental Sensitivity based on about 25,000 gene variants across the genome and then tested whether children at the extremes of this spectrum of genetic sensitivity differed in their response to the parenting quality they received. According to the results, children with high genetic sensitivity were more likely to develop emotional problems when experiencing negative parenting but also less likely to develop problems when parenting was positive. On the other hand, children with low genetic sensitivity were not as impacted by the experience of negative or positive parenting, and did not differ from each other in emotional problems based on parenting quality. Hence, this study provides important evidence that genetic sensitivity, measured across the genome, predicts children‚Äôs sensitivity to both negative and positive environmental influences.  Physiological markers of sensitivity  Several empirical studies have reported differences in sensitivity to the environment in relation to individuals‚Äô physiological reactivity. Higher reactivity generally appears to reflect greater sensitivity. For example, research has shown that children with a higher physiological response to stress (indicated by the hormone cortisol) are more strongly affected by their family‚Äôs financial situationObradovic, J., X.A. Portilla, and P.J. Ballard, Biological Sensitivity to Family Income: Differential Effects on Early Executive Functioning. Child Dev, 2016. 87(2): p. 374-84.. More specifically, a high cortisol response in children was associated with more positive cognitive development when family income was high, but with reduced cognitive development when family income was low. In contrast, family income was less relevant for the cognitive development of children who displayed low physiological reactivity (i.e., a low cortisol response). Similarly, adolescents with high cortisol levels have been found to report more stress when experiencing school-related challenges but also the lowest stress in less demanding situations, whereas adolescents with lower cortisol levels were generally less affected by either low or high school- related challenges Xu, Y., et al., Interaction Effects of Life Events and Hair Cortisol on Perceived Stress, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms Among Chinese Adolescents: Testing the Differential Susceptibility and Diathesis-Stress Models. Front Psychol, 2019. 10(297): p. 297.  Psychological markers of sensitivity  The majority of evidence for individual differences in sensitivity due to psychological markers of sensitivity is based on studies that investigate the interplay between infant temperament and parenting during childhood. Generally, higher fearfulness, fussiness, and negative emotionality in infancy have been associated with greater sensitivity to parenting quality. According to a large meta-analysis which summarises the findings from 84 individual studies, children that are characterised by a more sensitive temperament were more strongly affected by the parenting they receiveSlagt, M., et al., Differences in Sensitivity to Parenting Depending on Child Temperament: A Meta-Analysis. Psychol Bull, 2016.. More specifically, sensitive children were more likely to develop problems when experiencing harsh and punitive parenting but also least likely to have problems when they were raised in emotionally warm and caring environments. Less sensitive children, on the other hand, did not differ much from each other whether they received more negative or more positive parenting.  Determinants of Environmental Sensitivity  An individual‚Äôs level of Environmental Sensitivity is the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental influences across development. Empirical studies suggest that genetic influences are important for the development of the trait, but only about 50% of the differences in sensitivity between people can be explained by genetic factors, with the remaining 50% being shaped by environmental influences (see Figure 2). Furthermore, the genetic component of sensitivity is most likely made up by a large number of genetic variants across the whole genome, each making a small contribution, rather than a few specific genes. Importantly, although sensitivity has a substantial genetic basis, it may be the quality of the environment when growing up that shapes this genetic potential for sensitivity further. For example, those carrying a larger number of sensitivity genes may develop a sensitivity that is more geared towards threat when growing up in a challenging or adverse environment (i.e., vulnerability as described in the Diathesis-Stress model), whereas those growing up in a predominately supportive and secure context may develop heightened sensitivity towards positive aspects of the environment (i.e., Vantage Sensitivity). Similarly, those that experienced similar levels of both negative and positive exposures during childhood may develop equal levels of sensitivity to negative and positive experiences (i.e., Differential Susceptibility).  Underlying biological mechanisms of Environmental Sensitivity  Environmental Sensitivity proposes that sensitivity is driven primarily by a heightened sensitivity of the central nervous system (i.e., neurosensitivity)(see Figure 2 for an illustration of the neurosensitivity hypothesis). In other words, sensitive people have more sensitive brains, which perceive information about the environment more readily and process such information in greater depth. This likely involves specific structural and functional aspects of various brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus. These characteristics of the brain are then responsible for the typical experiences and behaviours associated with high sensitivity, such as experiencing emotions more strongly, responding more strongly to stressful situations or change, having a higher physiological reactivity, processing experiences in depth by thinking a lot about them, appreciating beauty, and picking up on subtle details. Figure 2. Illustration of the neurosensitivity hypothesis. Direct and interactive effects between sensitivity genes and environmental factors shape the sensitivity of the central nervous system. Heightened central nervous system sensitivity is then manifested in psychological/behavioral and physiological responsivity.  Measurement of Environmental Sensitivity  In the last few decades, researchers have identified a wide range of individual characteristics that reflect or are associated with sensitivity to environmental influences. These include specific aspects of child temperament (e.g., difficult temperament, negative emotionality, and impulsivity), physiological reactivity (e.g., high cortisol reactivity) and various genetic variants that can be combined into a polygenic score of sensitivity. However, although these characteristics are important and capture some aspects of sensitivity they cannot be considered precise measures in themselves. Given that sensitivity is a complex trait, similar to other personality dimensions, it is more helpful to measure sensitivity with questionnaires, interviews, or behavioural observations that focus on the assessment of the typical behaviours and experiences that reflect the core attributes of sensitivity (i.e., perception and processing).  Questionnaires  A series of such sensitivity scales have been developed and are briefly described below. = The Highly Sensitive Person Scale(HSP) = The Highly Sensitive Person Scale (HSP) is a 27-item self-report measure designed to assess Environmental Sensitivity in adults. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 = ‚ÄúNot at All‚Äù to 7 = ‚ÄúExtremely‚Äù. Items search for a tendency to be easily overwhelmed by external and internal stimuli (e.g. ‚ÄúDo you find it unpleasant to have a lot going on at once?‚Äù), greater aesthetic awareness (e.g. ‚ÄúDo you seem to be aware of subtleties in your environment?‚Äù), and unpleasant sensory arousal to external stimuli (e.g. ‚ÄúAre you bothered by intense stimuli, like loud noises or chaotic scenes?‚Äù). The scale exists also in a brief version with 12 itemsPluess, M., et al., People differ in their sensitivity to the environment: Association with personality traits and experimental evidence.

Dev Psychol, 2018. 54(1): p. 51-70. is a 12-item self-report measure that is based on the adult HSP scale and has been designed to assess Environmental Sensitivity in children and adolescents between the ages of 8 and 18 years. Items included in the HSC scale are rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 = ‚ÄúNot at All‚Äù to 7 = ‚ÄúExtremely‚Äù. Items are designed to capture different facets of sensitivity, such as the tendency to become mentally overwhelmed by both internal and external stimuli, greater appreciation of beauty, and overstimulation when experiencing intense sensory inputs. The HSC scale also exists in parent-rated version where parents can rate their child. To complete an online version, take the Sensitivity Test for Children .  Observational measures  The Highly Sensitive Child ‚Äì Rating System (HSC ‚Äì RS)Lionetti, F., et al., Observer-Rated Environmental Sensitivity Moderates Children‚Äôs Response to Parenting Quality in Early Childhood. Developmental Psychology, 2019. is an observational measure designed to assess Environmental Sensitivity in three- year-old children. Children‚Äôs responses in a series of standardised situations are observed and rated by trained experts.  Sensitivity groups = Orchids, tulips and dandelions  Initially, several psychological theories of sensitivity differentiated between two basic groups of people: those that are highly sensitive and those that are not. The assumption was that about 20% of the general population are characterised by high sensitivity. Such individuals have been compared to the ‚ÄúOrchid‚Äù, a plant that requires optimal conditions and care in order to flourish. In contrast, the remaining 80%, thought to be less sensitive, were compared to the ‚ÄúDandelion‚Äù, a plant that is robust and grows under many different conditions, to reflect this group‚Äôs tendency to be less affected by the quality of the environment Aron, E.N., A. Aron, and J. Jagiellowicz, Sensory processing sensitivity: a review in the light of the evolution of biological responsivity. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 2012. 16(3): p. 262-82.. More recently, this two-group hypothesis has been challenged by several studies reporting that sensitivity is more likely a common trait that is best considered a spectrum from low to high. This means that all people are sensitive but to different degrees. These studies found that people fall into three, rather than two, distinct sensitivity groups along a spectrum of sensitivity from low (30% of the population), to medium (40%), to high (30%)Lionetti, F., et al., Dandelions, tulips and orchids: evidence for the existence of low-sensitive, medium- sensitive and high-sensitive individuals. Translational Psychiatry, 2018. 8(1): p. 24.. According to this research, the 40% that fall into the middle of the sensitivity continuum are referred to as ‚ÄúTulips‚Äù, a plant that is more delicate than the ‚ÄúDandelion‚Äù but less fragile then the ‚ÄúOrchid‚Äù.  Future research  As with most psychological concepts, the current knowledge on Environmental Sensitivity has gaps. For example, it is not yet known how exactly sensitivity develops over time and whether it is set in childhood or can develop further in adulthood. More research is required to identify the biological and psychological mechanisms of sensitivity more clearly and to understand how genetic factors are associated with and contribute to sensitivity. Better knowledge on the mechanisms and specific characteristics of sensitivity will also improve the precise and reliable measurement of sensitivity.

It landed in Iowa City on June 20, 1841. Iowa City landing The steamboat was the first one to sail to Iowa City at its ferry landing on the Iowa River. The residents of Iowa City, in the then Iowa Territory, were shocked when the steamboat arrived on June 20, 1841 because such a thing was unexpected. Their local newspaper, the Iowa City Standard, said in an editorial, \\"We this week announce an event which in our judgment, is of more importance than any other that has happened since our city had its existence\\". The ferry landing was then known as the Steam Boat landing. The arrival of the Ripple made is so that Iowa City was not dependent on the other towns, which were located on the Mississippi River, for their imports. The next morning, the citizens had a meeting at a hotel and invited steamboat captain D. Jones, his crew, and his passengers to a dinner that was given in their honor. An Iowa City local, Captain Frederick M. Irish was chosen to board the Ripple to help scout out any obstructions in the river and to figure out how to remove those obstructions. The Ripple never returned to Iowa City. However, the steamboat Rock River traveled to Iowa City twice in 1842. Rock River was piloted by Captain Theyer and first arrived at Iowa City on April 21, 1842.

As the chaplain and confessor of Baldwin, Frankish lord of Marash, he wrote a funeral oration on the latter's death at the battle for Edessa in 1146. Basil's lengthy funeral oration or eulogy provides us with more information about Baldwin than any other lord of Marash. Basil describes Baldwin as fluent in Armenian. He describes his virtues in hyperbolic terms: \\"a handsome young man, a brave and mighty warrior, an ingenious, wise, and prudent prince whose life was so short, this gallant and charming man.\\" He calls him a captive who cannot be redeemed. He also presents his life as a warning to other Frankish leaders, for Baldwin was \\"unrepentant, arrogant and wicked\\". This part of the oration is given in the first person, that is, in Baldwin's voice. He is reproached (or rather reproaches himself) for injustice, luxury, power lust, greed and violence. Despite all the flaws Basil lists‚Äîand he refrains from listing specific misdeeds‚Äîhe declares that \\"all of [his] sins have been forgiven, and he has been made whole through his ceaseless confession and afterward through the shedding of his blood in the great battle.\\" According to Basil, Baldwin made a final confession before his death, lamenting the death of his parents and his poor relationship with his brother as punishments for his sins. Basil's oration was incorporated into the chronicle of Gregory the Priest. According to the 13th-century Armenian historian Sempad the Constable, Basil himself distributed copies of his poem to the Franks of northern Syria, especially Antioch. This probably contributed to Baldwin's subsequent fame. Scholars are divided on whether the oration should be seen as expressing strong affinity of the Armenians for the Frankish rule, or as a rebuke of the Franks for oppressing the Armenians. Basil's depiction of Baldwin's death in battle as cleansing him of sin is consistent with the theology of the Crusades and represents western influence. In other areas of theology, it appears that Basil had a strong eastern influence on Baldwin.

Launched in 1914 as Maristo, she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy for service in the First World War the following year. Maristo survived the war and resumed trawling for the next two decades, being renamed Caldew in that time. She collided with fellow trawler Ospray II in 1935, sinking the latter ship. On 27 September 1939, four weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War, the Caldew was intercepted by on a normal fishing trip south of the Faroe Islands. The submarine proceeded to order the trawler's crew into a lifeboat, after which the Caldew was sunk by U-33s deck gun. The crew were rescued but were captured by a German destroyer, who interned them in Germany. The crew of the Caldew were not liberated until the end of the war, and were the only British fishermen to be taken prisoner during the war. Construction and design Maristo (Official Number 128769) was constructed in North Shields by Smith's Dock Company Ltd., who also constructed the 97-horsepower T.3-cylinder engine. The steam trawler weighed and , with a length of , a beam of , and a height of . Maristo was launched on 10 May 1914 and was registered in Milford Haven by owner James Thomas on 6 November of the same year. History=Early service In December 1915, a year after Maristos registration, the trawler was requisitioned by the Royal Navy for active service in the First World War. During the conflict, the trawler was based at Portsmouth as a minesweeper and was armed with a 12-pounder gun. At some point in 1917, Caldew claimed an unconfirmed kill on a German submarine along with the armed trawler . The trawler was sold to Wyre Steam Trawling Co. Ltd of Fleetwood on 26 October 1917 and was returned to the company in September 1919, ten months after the end of the war. Maristo had been renamed Caldew by 30 September 1921, as she was registered at Fleetwood under the latter name on that day. On 14 February 1931, Caldew, along with fellow trawlers Dhoon and River Clyde, responded to a distress call made by the Finnish steamship Malve, which had ran aground on the island of Tiree in gale-force winds. The three trawlers stood by to assist, but Malve failed to refloat and was eventually abandoned by its crew. 4 years later, on 6 April 1935, Caldew collided with fellow Fleetwood trawler Ospray II while trawling south of Gigha. The collision tore a large hole in the Ospray II, causing fatal damage and leading to the trawler's sinking less than an hour later. The two skippers of the trawlers were blamed in an inquiry for not keeping watch at the time of the collision, and both had their certificates of competence revoked for a year. The Caldew was sold to St. Andrew's Steam Fishing Co Ltd. in 1938. Sinking On 16 September 1939, fifteen days after the outbreak of the Second World War, the Caldew, captained by Skipper Thomas Kane with twelve crewmen on board, set sail from Fleetwood to the Faroe Islands fishing grounds. After landing one of the crew members in the Faroes on 21 September, the ship began to trawl off the island chain. On 24 September, Caldew was stopped by south of the Faroes. The crew were ordered to sail away from the ship in a lifeboat, after which the trawler was sunk by the German submarine's 8.8 cm SK C/35 naval gun at . The Caldew crew were rescued by the Swedish steamer Kronprinsessan Margaeta, which itself was intercepted by the German destroyer and torpedo boat on 27 September. The destroyer interned the crew and transported them to Germany, where they were held at Sandbostel and Milag 8 prisoner of war camps. Skipper Kane and three hands were repatriated in prisoner exchanges during the war, while the remainder of the crew were liberated at the end of the war. The Caldew was the forty-second ship and the fifth trawler to be sunk by U-boats during the war, while the crew were the first Allied seamen and only British civilian seamen to be taken prisoner by German forces during the war.

Also known as Together with McGovern and Stars for McGovern, the concert drew a crowd of 18,000 to 20,000 attendees at Madison Square Garden in New York City. For the concert, Beatty reunited the folk duo Simon & Garfunkel, the comedy team of Nichols and May, and the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary. Appearing solo was R&B; and pop singer Dionne Warwicke. A number of celebrities served as ushers, and McGovern gave a speech. The event reportedly raised $400,000. This one-off reunion of Simon & Garfunkel came as a surprise to the public, as both artists had been promoting their solo careers. The album Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits was released at the same time by Columbia Records to capitalize on the publicity. The album rose to number 5 on the Billboard 200 in late July. McGovern was not significantly helped by the concert; after winning the Democratic Party nomination in July, he was soundly defeated in November by incumbent President Richard Nixon. Background Warren Beatty produced a string of concerts for McGovern Beatty had already produced concerts for McGovern's presidential campaign: a widely reported one in the Los Angeles area in mid-April called Four for McGovern, and another at the Cleveland Arena in late April. Two others were in San Francisco and Lincoln. These concerts had provided McGovern more media coverage and more campaign funds. In the 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries in June, McGovern carried California, but with a 5% margin, not the expected 20% more than Hubert Humphrey. On the night of the concert in New York, McGovern's goal was to raise more money and broaden his support, so that he could win more delegates at the Democratic National Convention one month later. Beatty had already tapped Paul Simon for the Cleveland concert in late April, and then he secured Art Garfunkel's agreement to reunite with Simon for one performance in June. Simon hated Nixon but his enthusiasm for McGovern was muted. Later he told Rolling Stone, \\"I do believe in the lesser of two evils, and in that spirit I became a McGovern supporter.\\" With Simon & Garfunkel willing to pair up, Beatty's theme for the June concert had jelled: McGovern would \\"bring us together again\\". Toward that end, Beatty called the separated comedians Mike Nichols and Elaine May to have them perform once again as a comedy duo, the first time since 1962. With these agreements in hand, Beatty convinced the broken-up Peter, Paul and Mary to reunite for the concert. The trio wrote about their experience later, saying, \\"Warren's enthusiasm was infectious, and we accepted his invitation. Although none of us expressed expectations of concerts beyond appearing together for McGovern, joining our trio once more for something bigger than ourselves had a familiar, prophetic quality. The seeds of reunion had been sown.\\" Beatty contacted Dionne Warwicke and Burt Bacharach to have them perform together. The two had made many hit songs together, the most recent being \\"Make It Easy on Yourself\\" in 1970. Bacharach declined the invitation because he had already committed himself for that date, but Warwicke said yes. Concert Singer Mary Travers said, \\"I think it's a crusade to save the country.\\" Tickets for the event ranged from $5 to $100. Some 18,000 to 20,000 people attended. Celebrity ushers on the arena floor mixed with hundred-dollar ticket holders. Celebrities serving as ushers included Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Newman, Ryan O'Neal, Ben Gazzara, Candice Bergen, Judy Collins, Stacy Keach, James Earl Jones, George Plimpton, Cass Elliot, Goldie Hawn, Lee Grant, Julie Christie and Shirley MacLaine. Actress Marcheline Bertrand and her actor husband Jon Voight attended. Nichols and May started the show around 9 pm. Nichols joked that they \\"had not spoken in 12 years\\" unlike the other artists on the program who had \\"quarreled viciously and broke up only a few months ago\\". May said she was in favor of McGovern's anti-war stance: \\"I've always wanted to get out of Vietnam ‚Äì even before we got in!\\" Peter, Paul and Mary performed next, talking about politics and singing songs including \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" by Bob Dylan, and \\"Leaving on a Jet Plane\\" by John Denver. Mary Travers said about the McGovern campaign, \\"I think it's a crusade to save the country\\" from Nixon. Music critic Don Heckman said that the trio's singing was \\"cohesive\\", that they \\"sounded as if they had never been apart.\\" They gave a rousing finish with Woody Guthrie's \\"This Land Is Your Land\\", the crowd coming to their feet. Dionne Warwicke sang a selection of her most successful songs. Producer Jon Landau said she \\"showed everyone why she is a such a unique interpreter of the great Bacharach and David hits\\". Simon & Garfunkel performed eight songs, starting with \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". The concert was captured by a tape recorder in the audience; this bootleg recording, despite its low quality sound, was circulated among fans for years. On the bootleg, Simon is heard laughing between songs after hearing shouts from the audience. Stifling his laughter, Simon explains to the crowd that someone \\"wants to hear 'Voices of Old People'\\" ‚Äì an impossible request. The suggested track was a spoken word collage on the album Bookends, featuring multiple recordings Garfunkel had made on the street, letting elderly people speak their minds. The duo ended the night with their inspirational anthem \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\", which was a favorite of McGovern's. Garfunkel had difficulty with his voice, so Simon sang the second verse, the first time he had done so in public. After nearly three hours of performances, McGovern appeared on stage with his wife Eleanor, and the arena rocked with applause for four minutes. McGovern stepped to the microphone to say, \\"Eleanor and I are glad to be here to make our contribution to the Richard Nixon retirement fund.\\" Afterward Following the concert, Beatty hosted a late dinner party at the nearby Four Seasons Restaurant, with A-list stars and political contributors invited. McGovern and his wife made an appearance, and the party continued until dawn. Shirley MacLaine co-produced a woman-focused event in October A few days after the concert, New York voters went to the polls to decide a number of issues including the Democratic Party nominee for president. McGovern was predicted the clear winner, with Hubert Humphrey polling poorly, and Shirley Chisholm still holding some delegates. Paul Simon said that Chisholm's campaign, promoting women and Blacks, was significant: \\"It's important that she maintain her candidacy up until the very last minute.\\" McGovern continued his success in July, winning the Democratic National Convention but failing in his wish to name Ted Kennedy as his running mate, and failing further to unite the party by convincing Humphrey to accept the position. His first choice, Thomas Eagleton, was a public relations nightmare, and his final choice, Sargent Shriver, was seen as out of touch with the working class. Warren Beatty's sister, Shirley MacLaine, co-produced another event for McGovern in October at Madison Square Garden, called Star-Spangled Women for McGovern‚ÄìShriver. With co-producer Sid Bernstein, she brought more than a dozen women singers together for a concert, and continued the theme of having celebrity ushers. Beatty himself served as an usher. By November, Richard Nixon had undermined McGovern's anti-war platform by announcing a withdrawal from the Vietnam War, and Nixon won the presidential election in a landslide. Six weeks later, though, Nixon ordered the bombing of Hanoi.

Fifth of July Mountain is situated in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher neighbor is Chilly Peak, to the north-northwest, and Carne Mountain is set to the northwest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains west into Rock Creek which is a tributary of the Chiwawa River, or east into Cow Creek, a tributary of the Entiat River. This geographical feature was named by surveyor Albert Hale Sylvester for the day he visited it.Details on places named by Sylvester from Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Fifth of July Mountain is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. With its impressive height, Fifth of July Mountain can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west-northwest of Fifth of July Mountain, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was written by Erica Flapan, based on a series of lectures she gave in 1996 at the Institut Henri Poincar√©, and was published in 2000 by the Cambridge University Press and Mathematical Association of America as the first volume in their shared Outlooks book series. Topics A chiral molecule is a molecular structure that is different from its mirror image. This property, while seemingly abstract, can have big consequences in biochemistry, where the shape of molecules is essential to their chemical function, and where a chiral molecule can have very different biological activities from its mirror-image molecule. When Topology Meets Chemistry concerns the mathematical analysis of molecular chirality. The book has seven chapters, beginning with an introductory overview and ending with a chapter on the chirality of DNA molecules. Other topics covered through the book include the rigid geometric chirality of tree-like molecular structures such as tartaric acid, and the stronger topological chirality of molecules that cannot be deformed into their mirror image without breaking and re-forming some of their molecular bonds. It discusses results of Flapan and Jonathan Simon on molecules with the molecular structure of M√∂bius ladders, according to which every embedding of a M√∂bius ladder with an odd number of rungs is chiral while M√∂bius ladders with an even number of rungs have achiral embeddings. It uses the symmetries of graphs, in a result that the symmetries of certain graphs can always be extended to topological symmetries of three-dimensional space, from which it follows that non-planar graphs with no self-inverse symmetry are always chiral. It discusses graphs for which every embedding is topologically knotted or linked. And it includes material on the use of knot invariants to detect topological chirality. Audience and reception The book is self- contained, and requires only an undergraduate level of mathematics. It includes many exercises, making it suitable for use as a textbook at both the advanced undergraduate and introductory graduate levels. Reviewer Buks van Rensburg describes the book's presentation as \\"efficient and intuitive\\", and recommends the book to \\"every mathematician or chemist interested in the notions of chirality and symmetry\\".

It began at the interchange between Interstate 29 (I-29), U.S. Highway 20, and U.S. Highway 77 (US 20 and US 77) in Sioux City and traveled north to end at Iowa 3 west of Le Mars. The route of Iowa 7 was an original primary road in 1920, but then it was known as Primary Road No. 29 (No. 29) and later Iowa 29\\\\. When I-29 was designated to come through Iowa in the 1950s, Iowa 29 was renumbered Iowa 7\\\\. Through Sioux City, the highway was well traveled, especially near I-29 and the downtown area; the inverse was true at the rural northern end. Subsequently, Iowa 7 was removed from the primary highway system in 1968. Route description Iowa 7 began at the cloverleaf interchange between I-29 and two U.S. Highways ‚Äì US 20 and US 77 in Sioux City. US 20 and US 77 traveled south from the interchange over the Pacific Shoreline Bridge into Nebraska. The two highways went in separate directions along I-29 ‚Äì US 20 follow southbound I-29 and US 77 followed northbound I-29. Iowa 7 formed the northern leg of the interchange. It traveled into the western edge of downtown Sioux City along Wesley Way and Perry Street before it turned to the northwest along 7th Street. It followed 7th for a few blocks and turned northeast onto Otoe Street, which became Hamilton Street shortly thereafter. From here, Iowa 7 runs along Hamilton Street for about before a series of curves to the east and then back to the north took the highway out of the city. At the Woodbury‚ÄìPlymouth county line, the highway became increasingly rural in character. The highway continued gradually curving to the east as it headed north while following Perry Creek. At County Road L (CR L, now CR C60) which connected to US 75 in Hinton, Iowa 7 took a due north‚Äìsouth path for the rest of its routing. It ended at a T-intersection with Iowa 3 at roughly the midpoint between Alton to the west and Le Mars to the east. History When the Iowa Primary Road System was created in 1920, No. 29 was designated from downtown Sioux City north to No. 27, which connected Le Mars and Akron. No. 29 began on Nebraska Street in downtown Sioux City and headed north with No. 12. At 27th Street, the routes turned west and then shortly thereafter turned to the northwest along Stone Park Boulevard. The routes split as No. 29 turned north onto McDonald Street and No. 12 continued on Stone Park Boulevard. No. 29 followed McDonald Street for a short way until it became Perry Creek Road, which curved east and north out of Sioux City. The northern end of the highway was north of its final end at No. 27. By 1925, the highway was paved within Woodbury County, but was a gravel road Plymouth County. The next year, as the U.S. Highway System was created, No. 29 was renamed Iowa 29; no routing changes occurred. In order to remove traffic from Iowa 12 and Iowa 29 from the residential neighborhoods along Nebraska Street north of downtown Sioux City, the two highways were rerouted to the west. The highways zigzagged along city streets while following Perry Creek. The new routing joined the former routing at Stone Park Boulevard in the northern part of town. By mid-1932, the Plymouth County portion of Iowa 29 had been paved with a bituminous surface. The route remained the same for over 20 years. At the northern end, Iowa 27 was absorbed into Iowa 5 in 1929. In 1953, the Iowa State Highway Commission heard proposals and ultimately decided to reroute Iowa 3 and Iowa 5 east of Iowa 29 in Plymouth County. After some delays, the paving project was let in August 1954 and was completed by the end of the year. In 1955, increasing traffic was causing civic leaders to consider highway widening projects for five state highways in Sioux City, Iowa 29 included. The proposal for Iowa 29 called for moving the highway to the western side of Perry Creek along Center Street to West 14th Street where it would reconnect to the present route. Ultimately, the city council decided in February 1956 to widen Hamilton and Otoe streets which would move Iowa 29 one block to the east. The straightened route opened in July 1957. Later in 1957, as I-29 was in the planning stages, the Iowa State Highway Commission renumbered Iowa 29 to Iowa 7\\\\. The change was made in order to not duplicate route numbers. In 1960, the many street names of Sioux City north of 7th Street that carried Iowa 7‚ÄìOtoe Street, Hamilton Street, Dearborn Street, and Perry Creek Road‚Äìwere renamed Hamilton Boulevard. In two separate meetings, Woodbury and Plymouth county officials talked to Iowa State Highway Commission officials about taking over the highway in each county. In Plymouth County, the annual average daily traffic in 1965 was 418 vehicles, which was markedly lower than the 5803 vehicles in Woodbury County. This iteration of Iowa 7 ceased to be on January 1, 1969. The Iowa State Highway Commission had completed a rationalization of the primary highway system; the Iowa 7 number was reused on a former segment of Iowa 5 from near Aurelia to Fort Dodge. Though it was no longer Iowa 7, the Sioux City portion of the highway stayed on the primary highway system for four more years as the unsigned Iowa 985.

History 8-Ball was formed in 2012 by a group of friends looking to help keep a billiard hall from going out of business in gentrifying East Williamsburg, Brooklyn. They hosted film screenings, readings, performances, parties, and other events at the request of Grand Billiards‚Äô owner, who wanted to attract the neighborhood‚Äôs new residents to his pool hall. These events included a zine fair, in which local artists and publishers were invited to sell their wares on pool tables. Grand Billiards‚Äô landlord shut down the space in August 2012, but the friends decided to keep working together, host more events, and welcome more people into the group they decided to call \\"8-Ball Community.\\" People gather for an event at 8-Ball's Newsstand. From 2013 to 2014, 8-Ball displayed zines and hosted dozens of events at an abandoned newsstand in the Metropolitan Avenue/Lorimer Street station of the New York City Subway. The Newsstand was rebuilt in 2015 as an installation at the Museum of Modern Art, which purchased it for the permanent collection and later exhibited it in Paris at Fondation Louis-Vuitton. The collective teamed up with tattoo artist Mark Cross to start Muddguts, an exhibition space in Williamsburg, which it helped run from 2013 to 2014. From 2014 to 2018, 8-Ball operated out of a basement in SoHo, described by The Village Voice as \\"a superhero's hideout ‚Äî if the superhero was some mythological lovechild of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Laurie Anderson.\\" From 2018 to 2019, 8-Ball maintained a space in a storefront on Canal Street in SoHo. In 2019, the collective was invited by the art nonprofit Creative Time to operate out of a floor of their building on the Fourth Arts Block in the East Village. These physical spaces have served as 8-Ball's headquarters as it has grown from a team of three ‚Äî Lele Saveri, Giuseppe Furcolo, and Josh Hubbard ‚Äî to a collective of dozens that operates a zine library, online radio station, and online public access television station. The collective has hosted film screenings, workshops, art exhibits, artist talks, skillshares, music shows, and other events out of these spaces. 8-Ball received nonprofit status through the fiscal sponsorship of Fractured Atlas in 2016. Projects=Zines Artists pack up their wares after the 15th 8-Ball Zine Fair, at El Coqui Billiards & Lounge in Ridgewood, Queens on June 22, 2019. 8-Ball hosts two annual zine fairs in New York and one in San Francisco. All its fairs are held at billiards halls and feature a drop-off table that allows anyone with a zine to sell their work. The collective has participated in zine fairs worldwide, including in S√£o Paulo and Tokyo, selling zines and setting up exhibits on topics such as public-access television production and the history of American zines. 8-Ball also produces zines and other printed matter, such as calendars and flyers, internally and in collaboration with other artists and groups. 8-Ball has hosted zine-making workshops at the Whitney Museum of American Art, MoMA, and the Aperture Foundation, and collaborated with the New York art bookstore Printed Matter on events in New York and Los Angeles. 8-Ball also maintains a library of several thousand zines, chapbooks, pamphlets, and artist's books at its East Village headquarters. It has displayed the zines at MoMA, MoMA PS1, and The Studio Museum in Harlem and in Miami, Istanbul, Amsterdam, Milan, Paris, Tokyo, and San Francisco. Radio 8-Ball launched its online radio station in 2014, when the collective was based out of the Williamsburg exhibition space Muddguts. Originally called Radio Muddguts 41, the station changed its name to 8-Ball Radio in 2015. Its shows include The Clayton Patterson Show and Dis Is A Test Radio. 8-Ball Radio frequently hosts events around New York City. In 2018, 8-Ball Radio was voted Listeners‚Äô Choice Best Online Radio Station in North America in the Mixcloud Online Radio Awards. Television 8-Ball TV Guide cover featuring Dawn Riddle of MTV12. 8-Ball launched its online public access television station on January 20, 2017, playing Aldo Tambellini‚Äôs piece ‚ÄúInauguration ‚Äô81‚Äù while Donald Trump was getting sworn in as president. 8-Ball described the station as a ‚Äúfree platform for, of, and by the people‚Äù with ‚Äúno censorship, no prejudice, no hierarchy, no advertisements, no limits.‚Äù 8-Ball TV‚Äôs content includes original series, submitted videos, and footage of interviews and protests. The station has aired Angela Davis‚Äô 1972 interview from California State Prison, footage of protests in New York and Standing Rock, a video countdown show called MTV 12, interviews with East Village residents, short films by Look At My Black Beauty (LAMBB), Hello Kitty‚Äôs Alice in Wonderland, ‚Äúcam-girl pseudo- porn and a video that shows how to skin a whole hog.‚Äù According to amNY, ‚Äúthe only thing 8-Ball [TV] won‚Äôt allow is branded or commercial content.‚Äù TANK Magazine likened the station‚Äôs programming to the 1970s downtown New York television show TV Party, ‚Äúknown for its decadent raucousness as much as its dissident outlook.‚Äù 8-Ball TV has exhibited in Milan, S√£o Paulo, and Tokyo. Other 8-Ball also produces merchandise, engages in social activism, and hosts educational workshops and opportunities for youth. 8-Ball‚Äôs activist work includes co-sponsoring the New York Kurdish Film and Cultural Festival. The collective airs protest footage and programs devoted to advancing social movements on 8-Ball TV and produces an activism zine called the Affinity Journal. In 2019, 8-Ball launched a mentorship program for emerging artists in memory of Jim Walrod, a New York designer, Fiorucci art director, and ‚Äúdowntown legend‚Äù who died in 2017. ‚ÄúJim‚Äôs Web‚Äù paired established artists such as Paper Magazine co-founder Kim Hastreiter with newer artists, who were given $3,000 to complete a project in four months. The projects were displayed in November 2019 at 8-Ball‚Äôs space in the East Village. In 2020, 8-Ball hosted a series of online educational workshops during the COVID-19 pandemic. The collective also partnered with artists including Tauba Auerbach, Daniel Arnold, and Kim Gordon to release a line of T-shirts for its eighth anniversary. Philosophy 8-Ball co-founder Lele Saveri started the collective in part to create a ‚Äúwelcoming place‚Äù within the New York art world. A 2017 Vice Media article describes the collective‚Äôs ethos as ‚Äúexplicitly inclusive‚Äù and ‚Äúfree of censorship, gatekeepers, and commercial interests.‚Äù In a 2019 interview with Love Injection Fanzine, Saveri describes his motivations for forming 8-Ball: The collective is run by volunteers in a non-hierarchical fashion. A 2018 Village Voice article defines 8-Ball‚Äôs ideals as ‚Äúeveryone is welcome,‚Äù ‚Äúwe have no elitism,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe do not have any association with brands.‚Äù See also *DIY ethic *Alternative culture *Underground culture  References External links * *8-Ball Radio *8-Ball TV Category:Artist groups and collectives Category:Zines Category:Internet radio Category:Internet television in the United States Category:Brooklyn ","title":"8-Ball Community"},{"id":"64789400","text":"Zhouguanqiao Township () is a township in Shaodong, Hunan, China.

It was built simultaneously to the building next to it, which currently houses the Atlanta Eagle, a gay bar that was the subject of a controversial police raid in 2009. The building was eventually converted to a Kodak shop, and during this time a large advertising sign for the company was added to the top of the building, which remains on the building today. In the early 2000s, the building served as the campaign headquarters for Shirley Franklin's team during her campaign to become mayor of Atlanta.

History Reeve was born in Locking, Somerset, the fourth son of lieutenant John Andrewes Reeve, R.N., and educated at Bristol College when J. E. Bromby was principal, with a view to an ecclesiastical career. Reeve emigrated to New South Wales in 1840. He worked as a clerk in the Central Police Court, then around 1857 joined the literary staff of the Sydney Morning Herald, for many years on the Parliamentary reporting Parliament and the law courts. Around 1860, while holding that post, he was appointed Curator of the Nicholson Museum of Antiquities at the Sydney University, and was energetic and assiduous in documenting the collection. He published its first catalogue, for which he was widely commended, and wrote on the early history of the university, with descriptions of the stained glass windows. He was the author of an historical drama Raymond, the Lord of Milan, based on Milanese History in the 13th century, which was published by Hawksley and Cunninghame in 1851 and produced in Sydney, starring H. N. Warner, Mrs Charles Poole, and Mr. Burford. He was author of a Gazetteer of Central Polynesia, published first in the Herald, 14 May 1857 ‚Äì 7 August 1857 then in booklet form, for which he received a vote of thanks from His Hawaiian Majesty Kamehameha V on 13 September, 1858. He also wrote many unpublished poems and several stories: The Caliph and the Slave, The Holy Child, The Schoolboy's Reverie. He also published a Treatise on Education in New South Wales, held by the Parliamentary Library. He is acknowledged as the founder (or with E. L. Montefiore (c. 1820 ‚Äì October 1894) cofounder) in 1871, of the New South Wales Academy of Art, whose patron was the Governor, the Earl of Belmore; president Thomas Sutcliffe Mort; vice-president Montefiore and Reeve himself as secretary. The Council included J. H. Thomas, William Wallis, James A. C. Willis, Thomas Hodgson, Lewis Steffanoni (c. 1836 ‚Äì 29 May 1880), Professor Charles Badham, and Robert Tooth. Reeve was forced to resign the secretaryship on 7 October 1873, and was succeeded by Eccleston Du Faur. None of these gentlemen was a recognised artist (though J. H. Thomas was a brother of William Cave Thomas); rather they were wealthy collectors who were content to show their collections, and perhaps dispose of some works by means of raffles or art unions. Of ordinary members, one whose name is recognised today as an artist is Conrad Martens. The Academy eventually became the National Art Gallery of New South Wales. He returned to the Civil Service, and was appointed Police Magistrate at Gosford, and subsequently at Port Macquarie. He died after a long illness.

She heads the Egyptian-Dominican mission in Alexandria, and is currently minister counselor in charge of cultural affairs at the Dominican embassy in Egypt. Early life Kathleen Mart√≠nez was born in Santo Domingo in 1966. Her father, professor and legal scholar Fausto Mart√≠nez, owned an extensive private library, which she drew on to research the subject which would become her great passion ‚Äì Egypt and the last days of Cleopatra. Her mother is of Franco-English descent. Studies Despite her childhood passion for Egypt, Mart√≠nez focused her early studies on a legal career. \\"My parents had convinced me that it was not worthwhile for me to be an archaeologist because I would never have a serious job and could not make a living from that profession. They convinced me,\\" she explained in some of her interviews. Like her father, she studied law, attending the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a, as well as going to study English at Brown University in the United States. She graduated at 18, and began working as a lawyer. She also holds master's degrees in finance and archaeology. Investigating the figure of Cleopatra Her obsession with Cleopatra ‚Äì she has explained repeatedly in the press ‚Äì was born out of an argument with her father in 1990, and a group of friends who considered that her biography was not very significant. Studying the history of Cleopatra, regardless of Roman propaganda and centuries of prejudice against women ‚Äì Mart√≠nez asserts ‚Äì allowed her to discover a woman ahead of her time, who studied at the university, who had to suffer the denigration of the Romans. \\"She knew medicine, laws; she was a philosopher, a poet,\\" Mart√≠nez explains. After advancing in her research, she discovered the difference between oriental texts and ones written by the Romans. She studied ‚Äì she explains ‚Äì the canonical texts in detail, in particular Plutarch's account of Mark Antony's alliance with Cleopatra. She also found that modern researchers had quite possibly missed important clues about where she was buried. In search of the tomb Her initial hypothesis was that since Cleopatra was considered the representation of Isis, if she had had to search for a place to be buried in her last days, she would have chosen a temple dedicated to the goddess. From Strabo's descriptions of ancient Egypt, Mart√≠nez sketched a map of potential burial sites and identified 21 localities associated with the legend of Isis and Osiris. After ruling out some temples, she located one on the outskirts of Alexandria that met all her criteria to be the one that sheltered the tomb: the temple of Taposiris Magna (the great house of Osiris). This was at odds with another hypothesis, developed by French explorer Franck Goddio and the European Institute of Underwater Archaeology, seeking the tomb in a palace of Alexandria which had been buried underwater by an earthquake, whose excavations were resumed in 1992. Mart√≠nez made her first trip to Egypt in 2002. She managed to contact Zahi Hawass, the archaeologist and director of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, and visit some temples. When she arrived at Taposiris Magna she understood, she explains, that it was the place she was looking for. She returned to her country, made the decision to upend her life, and prepared a project with the support of the Universidad Cat√≥lica Santo Domingo to begin excavating. It was the first time that Egypt had granted a license to excavate to a country in Latin America. Kathleen Mart√≠nez herself financed the first expedition and many others. Work began in 2004. In 2005, she decided to leave her law practice to move to Egypt and dedicate herself to archaeology. She also met with the Foreign Ministry and was appointed Egypt's cultural councilor traveling with a diplomatic passport. Excavations at Taposiris Magna Taposiris Magna, a semi-destroyed temple located on the edge of Lake Mariout in Borg El Arab, about 50 kilometers west of Alexandria, was the site Mart√≠nez selected. It was not the first time it had been excavated; the first expedition had been sent by Napoleon. The Egyptian authorities considered it an unimportant, unfinished temple. The reality, Mart√≠nez asserts, is that it had been destroyed and forgotten in the sand. The archaeological evidence includes two subterranean chambers within the temple's walls. Mart√≠nez claims this is a new and important contribution to archaeology. A hieroglyphic and Demotic stele has also been located, indicating that the temple was considered holy ground. In 2018, it was announced that more than 800 pieces had been located, plus a large cemetery with fifteen catacombs, 800 bodies, and 14 mummies all from the same period. During more than 100 years of excavations, busts and coins with the face of Cleopatra have also been found. In 2011 the magazine National Geographic dedicated its cover story and a report to the project. Use of technology for research In 2008, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was used to facilitate the search. It detected a network of tunnels and underground corridors at depths of 20.7 m, and three structures that could be burial chambers. In 2016, this was supplemented by a GPR surveyor using more powerful radar to detect new chambers and follow the extent of the tunnels already discovered, potentially speeding up excavation work. Exhibition at the Cairo Museum On 18 April 2018, the Cairo Museum inaugurated the exhibition \\"10 Years of Dominican Archaeology in Egypt\\", where the advances, achievements, and more than 350 architectural elements discovered by Mart√≠nez from the Ptolemaic dynasty were displayed. The artifacts are a record of daily life, administrative and religious activities, and royal and social roles that emerged at the end of the Ptolemaic period. The exhibition highlighted the first contribution of Latin America to the science of Egyptology. The most significant piece is the so-called \\"great stele\\", with a decree from Pharaoh Ptolemy V revealing the date of the temple's construction to be between 221 and 203 BCE, and demonstrating, according to Mart√≠nez, the importance of said religious construction dedicated to the goddess Isis. Proximity of the discovery of Cleopatra's tomb In January 2019, controversy arose over the possibility that the discovery of the tombs was imminent, attributed to remarks by Zahi Hawass at a conference at the University of Palermo. The Egyptologist denied the news in an article in the newspaper Al-Ahram, affirming that the thesis that the tombs were in Taposiris Magna was not his but that of Kathleen Mart√≠nez, and that he did not believe Mart√≠nez's hypothesis because \\"the Egyptians never buried inside a temple\\", given that \\"the temples were for worshiping, and this was for the goddess Isis. It is therefore unlikely that Cleopatra was buried there.\\" Awards and honours * (2010) * Cultural Personality of the Year Award (2011) * Recognition of the Foreign Ministry of the Dominican Republic \\"for her substantial contributions to universal culture and for placing the Dominican Republic on the world map of the intellectual community\\" (December 2018) References Category:1966 births Category:Dominican Republic archaeologists Category:Dominican Republic lawyers Category:Dominican Republic women lawyers Category:Dominican Republic women scientists Category:Living people Category:People from Santo Domingo Category:Universidad Nacional Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a alumni Category:Women archaeologists ","title":"Kathleen Mart√≠nez"},{"id":"64789956","text":"William O'Neal (April 9, 1949 ‚Äì January 15, 1990) was an American FBI Informant on Black Panther Party known for being the FBI informant who gave the floor plan to police in order to raid and kill Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in 1969.  Biography  William O'Neal was a career petty criminal in Chicago, doing \\"everything from car theft and home invasion to kidnapping and torture.\\" In 1966, when he was about 17 years old, he was caught by FBI agent Roy Martin Mitchell, who tracked O'Neal down for stealing a car and driving it across state lines to Michigan. In exchange for having his felony charges dropped, O'Neal agreed to infiltrate the Panthers as a counterintelligence operative.Iberia HAMPTON et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. Edward V. HANRAHAN et al., Defendants-Appellees, United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, September 12, 1979, page 1, paragraph 13, Law Resource Despite just being a teenager, O'Neal quickly became tasked with being among the heads of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton's security, and had keys to several Panther headquarters and safe houses. Eventually, Hampton was deemed a radical threat by the FBI, and they requested O'Neal give the layout of an apartment on Monroe Street in the West Side used by Hampton and the Panthers as a gathering spot so they could prepare a raid. On the evening of December 3, 1969, Hampton taught a political education class at a local church, attended by most Panther members. Afterward, he and several Panthers went to his apartment, and around midnight they ate a dinner prepared by O'Neal. O'Neal had slipped secobarbitol into Hampton‚Äôs drink so he would not wake up during the raid. O'Neal left and at about 1:30 a.m., December 4, Hampton fell asleep while talking to his mother on the telephone. At 4:00 a.m., the heavily armed police team arrived at the apartment, and at 4:45 a.m. stormed inside. Mark Clark, sitting in the front room of the apartment with a shotgun in his lap on security duty, was shot in the chest and killed instantly. The rest of the apartment was cleared out, and witnesses heard two bangs, presumably the close-range shots at the back of Hampton's head that killed him. In January 1970, a coroner's jury held an inquest, and ruled the deaths of Hampton and Clark to be justifiable homicide.  Later life  O'Neal's involvement in the raid was revealed in 1973, and he was relocated to California under the alias of \\"William Hart\\" via the Federal Witness Protection Program; he secretly returned to Chicago in 1984. In the early hours of January 15, 1990, O'Neal ran into traffic on Interstate 290, was hit by a car, and killed; he was 40 years old. His death was ruled a suicide, although his wife claimed it was accidental. Earlier in the evening, O'Neal had been drinking and attempted to jump out a second story window, but was pulled back inside. O'Neal's uncle Ben Heard said that O'Neal had \\"cooperated with the FBI to reduce his own potential jail time, then got in way over his head and was forever tortured by the guilt\\" and that \\"he never thought it would come to all this.\\"  In popular culture  O'Neal and his betrayal of Hampton is depicted in the film Judas and the Black Messiah, where he is portrayed by Lakeith Stanfield.

It is one of eleven windows he designed for the chapel at the beginning of his career. The commission, and this window in particular, sealed his reputation as an artist of international renown. Gobnait is shown in half profile, wearing an elaborate royal blue robe, a silver cloak and an extensive veil. The borders of the central glass panel are lined with blue and magenta coloured beads.\\"St. Gobnait\\". harryclarke.net. Retrieved 2 August 2020 The background of the window contains honeycomb-shaped lozenges. Background Gobnait was born in County Clare but moved for a time the island of Inisheer, where she founded a church. Clarke visited the island often during in the 1900s and later honeymooned there. According to the art historian Patricia Rogers, Clarke \\"certainly would have seen the famous ruins of Gobnet's first church on Inisheer, and these may have attracted him to the subject of this saint.\\" Gobnait became a healer and established a convent in Ballyvourney, County Cork. The design and building of the Honan Chapel was overseen by John O'Connell, a leading member of the Celtic revival and Arts and Crafts movements. O'Connell sought to construct a chapel that was evoked the aesthetic style found in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries and was \\"designed and fashioned on the same lines and on the same plan as those which their forefathers had built for their priests and missioners all over Ireland nearly a thousand years ago.\\" According to art critic Kelly Sullivan, the window succeeds in presenting \\"a particularly Irish idiom of natural imagery\\".Walker, Tom. \\"Harry Clarke‚Äôs uncanny visions of Ireland\\". Apollo, 29 May 2019. Retrieved 2 August 2020 Clarke's original modello, 1914. Corning Museum of Glass, New York. Clarke and his assistant Kathleen Quigly completed the window's modello under considerable time pressure over five weeks in 1914, during the offer period for the Honan commission and when Clark was still an largely unknown artist. A monochrome study was made in pencil, pen, inks, and watercolour on board, before the cartoon, now at the Corning Museum of Glass, was transferred to glass, when each panel was cut up, waxed and painted. The final window is the largest in the Honan. This was an expensive process, and was funded both by this father, and his friend Augtin Malloy. Description Preparatory study, detail of the upper panel St. Gobnait is shown in profile with a pale, thin and ascetic face and is given individualistic, unmistakably Irish features. She wears royal blue and purple robes adorned with lozenged jewels, a veil and silver cloak.Costigan, Lucy. \\"St. Gobnait\\". harryclarke.net. Retrieved 27 March 2020 The window's borders are lined with beaded decorations in ruby and blue. Her clothing draws from L√©on Bakst's costume for Ida Rubinstein's 1911 performance of \\"Le Martyre de saint S√©bastien\\". Highly detailed and complex floral patterns run along the outer borders of each of the window's registers. Gobnait is known as the patron saint of bees, and she is shown with bees hovering around her face, with a honeycomb at her feet, along with bees chase the thieves said by legend to have raided her church. In this story she unleashed bees against her attackers; Clarke shows \\"giant bees and tiny figures of frightened robbers peering out anxiously behind the blue-robed saint, whose pointed, impassive profile, unnaturally long slim hands and geometrically stylised body give her an otherworldly, non-human appearance\\". In the upper panel, the victims of a plague fled to her for sanctuary and protection. The image shows her drawing the sign of the cross on the road and marking a line around her church with her crosier. According to O'Connell, the line represents the point beyond which \\"the infection did not come, so that none of those who lived and served with her suffered from the plague.\\" Influences Alesso Baldovinetti, Portrait of a Lady in Yellow, c.1465. National Gallery, London Clarke admired Gustav Klimt, whose influence can be seen in the central panel's flatness. According to Michael J. O'Kelly, Clarke's evokes \\"three-dimensional human expression\\" using only Gobnait's face and hands, while all other details, including her robes and the floral background, are two dimensional and flat. The pose of her outstretched right arm draws from both Beardsley and Alesso Baldovinetti's c.1465 Portrait of a Lady in Yellow. The similarity to Baldovinetti's portrait is especially apparent in her tightly pulled-back hair, high forehead and the profile of her nose. (Gobnait is described in early accounts as a \\"sharp-beaked nun, and according to writer Frank McNally, Clarke gives her nose \\"the trajectory of an Olympic ski-jump\\".) Reception The window was described by the art historian Virginia Teehan as \\"kaleidoscopically sumptuous\\" and \\"filled with a wealth of art historical allusions, often unexpected\\". According to the Irish novelist E. ≈í. Somerville, it conjures late 19th century decadence in its resemblance to an Aubrey Beardsleytype female face, which \\"though horrible [is] so modern and conventionally unconventional... [Clarke's] windows have a kind of hellish splendour.\\" In 1917, Se√°n Keating produced a modernist oil on canvas painting titled \\"Thinking Out Gobneh\\", which shows Clarke working on a design for the window.

The farm stood in close proximity to the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Until the early 1920s the farm was a hothouse and catalyst for social and economical innovation, which helped mold and create several essential institutions and infrastructure elements of the Yishuv, perpetuated in the State of Israel after 1948: communal settlement forms (kvutza, kibbutz, moshav), women's rights movement, cooperative enterprises (for supplies and financial aid, milk collection and dairy production, construction and public works), a workers' savings and support bank, public health care system, a national paramilitary organisation. In its later years the courtyard served different lesser civilian and military purposes, was abandoned, then restored as a heritage site, and it 2007 it was opened as a museum and educational centre. Kinneret Farm Inside the \\"khan\\" building, the isolation bed for the sick \\"Maidens' Farm\\" apprentice in the courtyard Name In the Hebrew Bible, the Sea of Galilee is named Yam Kinneret, the Sea of Kinneret. History Established in 1908, the Kinneret farm has been active for four decades in preparing Jewish Zionist farmers for settling and working the land. During this time, among other achievements, five groups from the farm have established the kibbutz settlements of Degania (1909/1910), Kinneret (1913), Afikim (1932), Ein Gev (July 1937) and Ma'agan (1949). After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, for the next 25 years the place was used as a military camp by Nahal's 902nd Battalion. After being abandoned for a decade and reaching an advanced state of decay, the farm's buildings and courtyard have been in a process of restoration and rehabilitation of another almost three decades. Under Ottomans and Mandate (1908-1948) The farm was created in June 1908 as an experiment by the Palestine Bureau of the Zionist Organisation, and although it shared infrastructure and some activities with the moshava (health, security, cultural life), it was separate and autonomous from it as it served different practical and sometimes ideological purposes. The farm was built on the site of a ruin called MallƒÅha right next to the new Kinneret village.National Library of Israel, Eran Leor Map Collection, Jaffa: Survey of Palestine 1928 ‚Äì 1947, \\"Palestine\\" (Pal 1157), Map section 20-23-21. (URL: http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/Hebrew/digitallibrary/pages/viewer.aspx?presentorid=NLI_MAPS_JER&docid;=NNL_MAPS_JER002367636#FL21693860) Arthur Ruppin, the head of the Palestine Office of the Zionist Organisation and one of the leading Zionists of the time, was the initiator and man in charge. Unlike the moshava, the farm was meant as a training facility for agricultural work and became a laboratory for social and economic experiments, many of the structures and organisations on which pre-State Jewish and post-1948 Israeli society relied and still relies being initiated here. Such are the communal settlement forms of the kvutza, kibbutz and moshav, the women's rights movement‚Äîbeginning with an agricultural training farm for women in 1911 and continuing with the first assembly of women farmers in 1914‚Äî, the cooperatives HaMashbir (for the sale of affordable food during World War I; est. 1916), Tnuva (milk and dairy products; est. 1926), and Batz construction company, the future Solel Boneh (est. 1921) which emerged from the Work Battalion, the Bank Hapoalim or \\"workers' bank\\", the kupat holim public health care system, and last not least the Haganah paramilitary organisation. The Farm residents also had a major role in establishing and shaping the Histadrut labor union. In its early years it was joined by local Jewish farmers from the surrounding villages, and very soon after by the very young pioneers of the Second Aliyah. The original Jewish settlers stayed in the so-called Khan, a word meaning caravansary, and being no more than a storage building bought from a local Bedouin tribe. The early days were marked by poverty, malaria, Bedouin attacks and ideological conflict. After a workers' strike in October 1909, Ruppin allowed the workers on the farm to split in two: the farm went on being run by a rather authoritarian agronomist, while seven pioneers were given autonomy and founded the first kvutza. They were a young group who received from the national Zionist organisations a plot of land to toil, which they managed to do more successfully than the hierarchically run Kinneret farm. They eventually settled down, naming their commune Degania. This group was part of an influential, if small wave of young Zionists who derived inspiration from Ber Borochov's Marxist-socialist ideas as much as from the mystical \\"religion of labour\\" of A.D. Gordon, a man morally influenced by ideas he had brought with him from his native Russia, the agrarianism of the Narodniks and Tolstoy's spirituality. Beit Ha'almot or Havat Ha'almot (lit. the Maidens' House or Maidens' Farm), an agricultural training farm for women, was established within the colony in 1911; it had to be closed in 1917 due to the hardships of World War I. Pioneers from the Kinneret Farm founded the first kvutzot or small farming communes, Degania in 1910 and Kvutzat Kinneret in 1913, as well as the first large farming commune or kibbutz, Ein Harod , and the first communal agricultural village or moshav, Nahalal, both in 1921. One of the founders of the Kinneret Farm, Ben-Zion Israeli (1887‚Äì1984), helped reintroduce date palms to Palestine by travelling to Iraq, Iran, Kurdistan and Egypt in the 1930s where he identified suitable varieties of which he bought and adventurously brought back large quantities of saplings. In 1919, Kvutzat Hashishim (the Group of 60) joined the farm. Their combination of farming and contract work inspired Kinneret member Shlomo Lavi's concept of the large kibbutz. In 1929, the Kinneret Group moved to its current location, and the farmhouse became a temporary residence for different groups before settling in their permanent localities. In 1949, the courtyard became a military camp. When this was dismantled in the late 1970s, the location was named a national historic site. =National projects initiated at the Farm= Many of the initiatives had to do with the activity of Berl Katznelson. * The kvutza type of communal settlement **Degania, the first kvutza, est. 1909 by pioneers trained at Kinneret Farm * The kibbutz type of communal settlement **Ein Harod, the first kibbutz, est. 1921 by pioneers trained at Kinneret Farm * The moshav type of communal settlement **Nahalal, the first moshav, est. 1921 by pioneers trained at Kinneret Farm * The women's rights movement in pre-state Israel ** Beit Ha'almot or Havat Ha'almot agricultural training farm for women, active 1911-1917 at Kinneret Farm ** The first assembly of women farmers (1914) * HaMashbir cooperative for the sale of affordable food during World War I, est. 1916 * Tnuva cooperative for milk and dairy products, est. 1926 * Solel Boneh construction company, est. 1921; emerged from the Work Battalion * Bank Hapoalim workers' bank, est. 1921 * kupat holim public health care system * Haganah paramilitary organisation: at the 2nd assembly of the Ahdut HaAvoda party held at the Farm in June 1920, the agenda included the founding of the Haganah The Farm residents also had a major role in establishing and shaping the labor union of pre-state Israel: * Histadrut labor union After the establishment of the state From 1950 to 1974, the farm served as an IDF base before being abandoned.

It grows on rocky slopes and steep banks, often in forests. Like many of the false cloak ferns, it bears white powder on the underside of its leaves. First described as a species in 1825, it was transferred to the new genus Argyrochosma (the \\"false cloak ferns\\") in 1987, recognizing their distinctness from the \\"cloak ferns\\" (Notholaena sensu stricto). Description Argyrochosma incana is a medium-sized epipetric fern. The rhizome is short, thick, and may be horizontal or somewhat upright. It bears linear to lance-shaped scales long and wide, without teeth at the margins, of a uniform dark, shiny brown color or yellowish-brown with some dark brown patches. From the rhizome, the fronds arise in clumps. From base to tip of leaf, they are long, sometimes up to . Of this length, about half is made up by the stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the blade), which is shiny and round, hairless, and dark purple to black in color, occasionally chestnut- brown. It is typically in length and in diameter. The leaf blades are triangular or lance-shaped, tripinnate (cut into pinnae, pinnules and pinnulets) to almost quadripinnate at the bases. They are wide, occasionally as little as . They are blunt at the base and pointed to acuminate at the tip. The rachis (leaf axis) is round, rather than flattened. The rachis and the axes of the leaf segments are all dark in color; the color stops abruptly at a joint at the base of the leaf segment. Each blade bears 6 to 9 pairs of pinnae, borne oppositely on the rachis. The ultimate segments of the blade are elliptically shaped, long, occasionally as little as . They are grayish-green in color and leathery in texture. The underside of the leaf is coated in white farina (powder), which may be sparsely scattered on the upper surface or absent from it. The leaf axes curl upwards when dry. The sori lie along the veins, forming a band wide. The veins themselves tend to blend into the leaf tissue. The leaf edges are not curved under or modified into false indusia. Each sporangium bears 64 spores. The plants are diploid, with a chromosome number of 2n = 54. Within the heart of its range, in Mexico, A. incana is both the most widespread member of the genus and the most variable. Some of the characteristics observed to vary are the size of segments (reduced to wide), the density of adaxial farina, the shape and color of the blade axes (zigzag rather than straight, and dark purplish rather than black), and the joint at the base of leaf segments (more sharply defined). Material collected in several states of northern Mexico, with small segments, somewhat zig-zag and dark purplish axes may represent an as yet undescribed species. Two specimens collected by C. H. M√ºller and his wife Mary in Nuevo Leon are anomalous in having chestnut-brown axes and rougher spores, similar to A.&delicatula;, but their size, abundance of farina abaxially, and lack of it adaxially, led Maxon and Weatherby to classify them as A. incana. In Mexico, it is quite similar to A. delicatula, from which it is distinguished by having white (rather than pale yellow) farina, and A. formosa, which lacks farina. Most specimens in the United States were originally mislabeled as A. limiteana, but this species lacks the joint and abrupt end of dark color at the base of its leaf segments. Taxonomy It was first described in 1825 by Carl Borivoj Presl as Notholaena incana, based on material collected by Thadd√§us Haenke in Mexico. He did not explain why he chose the species epithet incana, meaning \\"hoary\\" (grayish-white). In 1859, Mettenius recognized the genus Gymnogramma for species where sporangia were borne along the nerves and not densely clustered at the end of the nerves. He independently described the species based on material collected by Eug√©nio Schmitz in Mexico, naming it G. candida. The epithet refers to the chalk-white color of the farina beneath the leaves. Prantl expanded Pellaea to include several genera in which he perceived close affinities, including Gymnogramma. Accordingly, he transferred G. candida to Pellaea section Cincinalis as P. candida in 1882. William Ralph Maxon and Charles Alfred Weatherby placed N. incana within a group of ferns closely related to Notholaena nivea. Both Edwin Copeland and Weatherby suggested in the 1940s that this group of ferns might represent a distinct genus of its own. This was finally addressed in 1987 by Michael D. Windham, who was carrying out phylogenetic studies of these genera. He elevated Notholaena sect. Argyrochosma to become the genus Argyrochosma, and transferred this species to that genus as A. incana. Meanwhile, John Mickel and Joe Beitel had transferred the species to Cheilanthes as C. incana in their monograph on the ferns of Oaxaca, which was published in 1988; Mickel and Alan R. Smith recognized Argyrochosma in 2004 when preparing a fern flora of Mexico. In 2018, Maarten J. M. Christenhusz transferred the species to Hemionitis as H. incana, as part of a program to consolidate the cheilanthoid ferns into that genus. While the distinctness of A. delicatula from A. incana has been questioned in the past, phylogenetic studies have upheld the separation of the two taxa. It lies within a subclade of the genus that also contains A. incana, A. pallens, A. peninsularis, A. palmeri, and A. pilifera. All members of the clade share pale farina principally composed of terpenoid compounds, unlike the dihydrostilbenoids found in the farina of other members of the genus. Distribution and habitat Argyrochosma incana is known from New Mexico and Arizona south through most of the states of Mexico to Guatemala, and also as a disjunct in the Dominican Republic. David Lellinger reports a specimen (G√≥mez 7156, CR) collected in Costa Rica, although this occurrence is not mentioned in other floras. In Mexico, it grows on rocky slopes, banks, and ledges, often shaded or in woods, especially pine-oak forests. It is found at an altitude from . Irving Knobloch reported that material collected from rock crevices in Chihuahua was growing in neutral soils within the crevices. At the northern edge of its range, in the United States, it is found growing from canyon walls, exclusively on igneous rock. In Guatemala, it is found on both shaded and sunny rocks, and growing from rock walls and cliff crevices. Conservation Under the NatureServe conservation status system, A. incana is ranked as secure (G5), but it is considered imperiled in Arizona.

Born in 1972 in Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan, Oda showed an interest in gaming during his childhood which led him to study animations when growing up. He debuted as a developer for SNK, doing debugs of certain game while being a major planner in Garou: Mark of the Wolves. In 2000, he moved Dimps to later work once again in SNK in mid-2010s to direct The King of Fighters XIV and other installments from SNK's properties. Biography=Early life and preferences Oda was born in 1972 in Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan. As a child he did not enjoy arcade games and instead played Donkey King, Crazy Kong, and Crazy King. He was a fan of virtual reality and aimed towards games that allowed the player to replicate the mecha anime Mobile Suit Gundam. When it comes to anime, he has shown preference to Golden Kamui and Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans while he also enjoys tokusatsu Kamen Rider, most specifically Kamen Rider Agito, and the action RPG Tokyo Mirage. His favorite games involve open-worlds like Assassin‚Äôs Creed Origins, Horizon Zero Dawn. He believes that Japanese players should try Infamous Second Son while Westerns should play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Oda and SNK game designer Nobuyuki Kuroki studied in the same art school, Osaka Designers' College. There, Oda studied animation. Career Oda was a member of SNK R&D; Division 1 from April, 1993 to February, 2000. His first job involved Fatal Fury Special fixing bugs and Art of Fighting 2 as designing the character Takuma Sakazaki which he found challenging based on the fact his torso was not covered by clothing. Blue Mary was a challenge to design as a result of how complex her grapple moves are to animate. During her debut in Fatal Fury 3, not many people on the team knew much information about her fighting style, sambo. At one point, one of the designers working on Blue Mary, Youichiro Soeda, used Oda a training dummy to show off some of the attacks he had in mind to the rest of the team. Oda joked that he suffered major wounds after being used by the character designer. Though not a developer, Oda was impressed by The King of Fighters '94 due to the game's capabilities which were outstanding when it was released. He had minor involving within the game The King of Fighters '95 and Kizuna Encounter. Both Kuroki and Oda wondered what type of hero would succeed Terry Bogard in Fatal Furys latest game, Garou: Mark of the Wolves. While they were not confident with Rock Howard, they still decided to make him as the new protagonist. Oda feels proud for his contributions to the Fatal Fury series due to adding the game mechanic of cancelling \\"Super\\" attacks. In 2000, Oda left SNK to join Dimps. As part of Dimps, Oda was the battle designer of Street Fighter IV and worked in the crossover Street Fighter X Tekken. Oda would later direct The King of Fighters XIV after returning to SNK. This was his first contribution to the franchise, leading a younger staff. During Oda's first employment at SNK, games like Virtua Fighter motivated him to make a 3D game after his departure. When Oda returned to SNK, he decided to transition the King of Fighters series from 2D to 3D though the adaption of some characters was more difficult than others. Despite initial issues with the online mode and other features from the game, Yasuyuki Oda stated the fan response to The King of Fighters XIV was positive especially after fixing these issues. As a result, he thinks The King of Fighters XV is possible but the company wants to focus on other franchises too. In making the arcade port of this game, Oda was inspired by Taito's NESiCAxLive 2 based on its capabilities. Oda stated Leona Heidern and Kyo Kusanagi are his favorite characters in The King of Fighters series. Oda noted that while researching new characters for KOF XIV, Kyo's moves avoided stereotypes like Japanese sumo wrestlers to produce more variety within the cast, which included characters of multiple nationalities. Oda added that they \\"Kyo-ify\\" the new members to produce originality in the game. Following the success of The King of Fighters XIV, SNK decided to develop a more light-hearted game solely focused on female fighters, SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy. Oda stated that while initial mentions of the game made the mechanics sound more simplified than previous games, the team also worked highly in a complex system which would attract experts in the genre. Oda returned as producer for Samurai Showdown due to major feedback. Oda aimed each character to play unique and showed an interest in adding a guest character from Lord of the Rings: Aragorn. Samurai Shodown was one of the series Oda wanted to develop from a long time based on its weaporny usage.

Early life Watkins was born in Newcastle, New South Wales on 8 February 1950. He was educated at Grafton High School and Hawkesbury Agricultural College. Australian Rugby Watkins was selected in the Australian Rugby team, the Wallabies, and was a reserve in the three Test match Bledisloe Cup series against New Zealand in 1980 held in Australia. New South Wales government career Watkins held a range of senior New South Wales public service positions including: * Commissioner of the NSW Soil Conservation Service * Director-General of the Department of Lands 2003‚Äì11 * Chief Executive of the Land and Property Management Authority (LPMA), 2000‚Äì11 * Surveyor-General of New South Wales 2000‚Äì11 * Registrar-General, 2003‚Äì11. He also held a range of inter-governmental appointments including Deputy Commissioner of the Murray Darling Basin Commission 1992‚Äì95, Chair of the Total Catchment Management Coordinating Committee and Deputy Chair of the CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship Board. Watkins was Chairman of the Australian New Zealand Land Information Council, 2000‚Äì2011. With a career of 41 years, Watkins was dismissed from the NSW Public Service after the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) found in December 2011 that Watkins acted corruptly. Watkins admitted he had used a letter backdated by former planning minister Tony Kelly to mislead investigators.https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/a4/69/96/fa/53/e6/1c/88/1a/7d/c1/4c/64/50/93/9a/obj/document.pdfhttp://www.mappingsciences.org.au/joom/images/eCarto/ecarto%20newsletter%20august%202011%20msia.pdf Currawong land deal ‚Äì ICAC investigation (Operation Napier), Prosecution and Convictions On 20 June 2011, ICAC announced that it would hold a public inquiry into matters arising from the purchase of property at Currawong, Pittwater by the NSW Government. Specifically, purchase involved four properties at Currawong, Pittwater, were purchased for $12.2 million on 15 March 2011 by Watkins on behalf of the NSW Government from the owner, Eco Villages Australia Pty Limited. The properties were previously owned by a NSW union. ICAC held a public inquiry over 11 days during June and July 2011. The ICAC Commissioner, the Hon. David Ipp AO QC, presided at the public inquiry. Twenty-one witnesses gave evidence. ICAC concluded its investigation in mid- December. ICAC found that the Minister for Lands Tony Kelly engaged in corrupt conduct with respect to the purchase of the property by the NSW Government. Specifically, ICAC found that Kelly, authorised the purchase even though he knew he was not authorised to do so, and that he backdated a letter to before the caretaker period of government commenced, knowing that it would be used by a public servant to falsely represent that written authority had been given to authorise the purchase. That public servant was Watkins, Director General of the Department of Lands.ICAC, 2011. ICAC REPORT Investigation into the unauthorised purchase of property at Currawong by the Chief Executive of the Land and Property Management Authority, December 2011. www.icac.nsw.gov.au The property purchase was undertaken during the caretaker period of government ‚Äì that period of time between the announcement of the calling of the state elections and the forming of the government after the elections. The NSW state elections were held on 25 March 2011. As the property purchase should not to be undertaken during the caretaker period, the legitimacy of authorisation was quickly raised within the senior levels of the public service. On 17 March 2011 the Director General of the Department of Premier and Cabinet NSW requested the Internal Audit Bureau (IAB) to investigate Watkins' authority to purchase the site and on 18 March 2011 Watkins was stood down from the public service. Subsequently, Watkins contacted Kelly and asked if he would sign a letter, backdated to 28 February 2011, that would authorise Watkins to purchase the Currawong property. The effect of the backdating of the letter was to convey that prior authority had been given by the NSW Premier Kristina Keneally on 25 February 2011, in her letter to Minister Kelly. Watkins claimed the letter to Kelly dated 25 February 2011 from Premier Keneally authorised the purchase of the site, and he acted on the direction of Minister Kelly's letter dated 28 February 2011. However, ICAC found that the Premier's letter only authorised negotiations and did not actually authorise Watkins to purchase the site. Further, ICAC's investigations confirmed that Kelly's letter to Watkins had been fraudulently backdated. ICAC also produced evidence that Watkins organised a secret rendezvous with staffer, Costello where he discussed his evidence. This action by Watkins took place despite ICAC warning Watkins not to discuss evidence and meet with other witnesses. This was also a breach of ICAC by Costello. ICAC's opinion was that the matter be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions with respect to the prosecution of Watkins, Kelly and Costello for various criminal offences. Arising from ICAC's investigation and DPP advice, it is significant that only Watkins would face criminal charges and be convicted. Watkins faced criminal charges in the NSW Local Court where it was reported he could have received 10 years imprisonment. Keneally testified that she only authorised Watkins to start negotiating with the developer who owned the property. She testified that he was not authorised to complete the purchase by agreeing to the $12 million deal. Keneally confirmed that Watkins proceeded without the authorisation from the executive level of government and it occurred when the government was in caretaker mode. Watkins faced court in December 2013. Two of the charges were dismissed by the Court. However, Watkins was convicted on the further two charges of misleading ICAC, to which he had pleaded guilty and was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond. ANZLIC Watkins was Chairman of the Australian New Zealand Land Information Council, 2000‚Äì2011, when he was dismissed from the NSW Public Service. ANZLIC labels itself as the Spatial Information Council and claims to be \\"the peak intergovernmental organisation providing leadership in the collection, management and use of spatial information in Australia and New Zealand.\\" https://www.anzlic.gov.au/ ANZLIC chair appointments are typically only for two years, but Watkins held the chair for more than eleven. Drew Clarke immediately replaced Watkins as Chair of ANZLIC and remained as Chair until mid 2015. Spatial Information Industry Action Agenda ANZLIC, under Watkins‚Äô chairmanship, instigated the national Spatial Information Industry Action Agenda and received federal ministerial endorsement. The objectives of the Action Agenda were to identify opportunities and impediments to the progress of the spatial information industry and to develop a policy framework that would underpin growth through a commercially successful and internationally competitive Australian industry.https://www.crcsi.com.au/assets/Resources/33dbc19a-4938-4f46-9a43-d9ff07f5209c.pdf Warren Entsch, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, launched the establishment of a steering group to drive the Spatial Information Industry Action Agenda in November 2000.

Minchin also identified the key intergovernmental roles of ANZLIC under the Action Agenda. Elizabeth O'Keeffe, the ANZLIC delegate for Victoria, represented Watkins on the steering committee for the Spatial Information Industry Action Agenda. The Cooperative Research Centre, CRC for Spatial Information (CRCSI) also arose as initiative under the action agenda, receiving federal funding. Watkins served as a Director of CRCSI until he resigned in 2011. The CRCSI 2011-12 Annual Report (page 12) reports Watkins resigned \\"following his retirement from the NSW government\\". https://frontiersi.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/CRCSI-Annual- Report-2011_2012.pdf Honours and awards Watkins was awarded Member of the Order of Australia \\"for service to spatial information and natural resource management through leadership roles within a range of public sector agencies\\".

Other awards included Fellow of the Australian Property Institute, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors and the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering. However, his criminal convictions following the ICAC investigations led to him being stripped of some of the awards. On 23 October 2014, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors expelled Watkins from the Institution and he automatically lost his Fellowship.

The rock is a large glacial erratic painted green with a white lip and eyes to resemble a lugubrious frog. The rock was first painted and turned into an attraction in 1881 by state legislator Thomas J. Thurber (a Republican from Putnam), who passed the rock frequently on trips to Hartford and observed that it resembled the shape of a squatting frog. The location became a popular roadside picnic area for many years for travelers between Providence and Hartford. In 1997 a group of Thurber's descendants repainted it, vowed to maintain Frog Rock in perpetuity, and added a memorial to Thurber on a nearby rock. After road work left Frog Rock further from traffic and left the site prone to vandalism, the State of Connecticut offered the land to neighboring towns. Receiving no offers, the state put the site up for sale. In 2012, Joe Lernould bought the 2.5-acre wooded rest stop from the state for $27,000 and then opened a small seasonal antiques store, gift shop, and food truck. Lernould reported four thousand visitors in 2013 alone. The site is popular for picnics due to its five historic concrete picnic tables, and sometimes features live music. It is open Thursday-Sunday, May through September.

History  Bunim Laskin came up with the idea in New York at the age of 19 during the summer after noticing a neighbor's pool which was rarely in use. He rented their pool in exchange for assistance paying for the pool's upkeep. He then realized that he might have a scalable business plan and began finding other neighbor's pools using Google Earth's satellite photos. Originally naming his company Pool4U, he soon had over 30 pools listed and was featured on MSNBC. By the end of the year he dropped out of college to pursue the business full-time. In November 2019, Swimply expanded to Australia. Laskin appeared on a March 13, 2020 episode of Shark Tank pitching an investment opportunity in his company.  Funding and revenue  Laskin received $30,000 from family and friends, followed by $1,200,000 in an initial seed round. Another round of funding fell through due to the COVID-19 pandemic, though founder Laskin claims they are profitable. Swimply follows the model of Airbnb receiving a 15% commission of the rental price plus an additional 10% fee charged to the guests. Hourly rentals are in the range of $45 to $60 an hour.  Liability  Swimply requires both renters and guests to sign waivers. As Swimply does not provide insurance for pool owners, pool owners are liable in case of injury. The company does require pool owners have their pools inspected for health and safety including inspection of tiles and chlorine levels.  Regulations  In Rockland County, New York, renting out a private pool violates local sanitary codes and early renters on the platform were advised that fines can rise up to $2,000 a day. In Toms River, New Jersey, all listings were removed by owners after complaints and action by the township.

The original bridge opened in 1949, and was replaced between 2005 and 2012.  History = Original bridge (1949-2012)  The original bridge was completed in 1949, and opened on October 21 of that year by Governor Thomas E. Dewey. The four-lane bridge was built using a pin-hanger design. The construction and subsequent opening of the bridge eliminated the traffic bottleneck on Main Street and Old Northern Boulevard in the heart of Roslyn that had resulted from the increasing number of automobiles on the roads. The original span of the William Cullen Bryant Bridge crossing Hempstead Harbor, looking northeast. Note the new bridge being built behind it. By the 1990s, the bridge was beginning to show its age. Advancements in bridge engineering and safety rendered the structure obsolete; New York stopped building bridges using the pin-hanger design in 1968. Additionally, there were concerns regarding the bridge's structural integrity, especially after the 1983 Mianus River Bridge Disaster, in which a similarly-designed bridge carrying Interstate 95 in Connecticut collapsed. After careful consideration, officials ultimately decided to replace the bridge, with initial development for the project first taking place between 1992 and 1993.  Current bridge (2012-present)  In 2005, construction commenced on a replacement bridge, as the original one was in a state of disrepair, was structurally-obsolete, lacked shoulders, and exceeded its intended use life. Given the lack of efficient detour routes, construction was carried out in phases; one side would remain open whilst the other was demolished and rebuilt. Three lanes would be in use at any given time, and their directions would be reversible; in the mornings, there would be 2 westbound lanes and 1 eastbound lane, and the afternoons/evenings would see 2 eastbound lanes and 1 westbound lane. Construction was originally intended to be completed by 2007 - but numerous factors led to multiple delays, and the replacement bridge was finally completed in 2012. The new bridge, features many enhancements enhancements, including a shoulder lane, an improved walkway, and better drainage. The new bridge is a total of 13 feet wider than its predecessor.

Morse Micro is a Sydney-based developer of Wi-Fi HaLow microprocessors. The chips use low- bandwidth wireless network protocols in the sub 1 GHz spectrum, enabling high data rates of 10 megabits per second, at a range of 1,000 metres. The Australian Government provided them with seed funding in 2017 as they believed Morse Micro has the ‚Äúfirst WiFi HaLow silicon chip that securely connects smart devices over long distances.‚Äù The company says the main application of their technology is machine-to-machine communications, which is ‚Äúexpanding Wi- Fi so it can go into everything, every smoke alarm, every camera.\\" In May 2019, Series A funding was provided in by a suite of investors including the CSIRO Innovation Fund, part of the Australian scientific research agency credited with inventing Wi-Fi in 1997.  Technology  The chip communicates on the 750 - 950 MHz band which allows for higher data speeds than Bluetooth communications operating at 2.4 GHz. It enables a single Wi-Fi HaLow Access Point that can securely connect up to 8,191 devices. Compared to traditional wi-fi, the company claims their chip provides 10 times the range, 100 times the area and 1000 times the volume. Physically, the company's microchip is one-fifth the size of a traditional Wi-Fi processor. It uses very little energy, consuming 1% of the power consumed by traditional chips, which is achieved by periodically waking and reporting. As such, chips can operate for several years on a single coin-size battery. In 2020, the first generation of Morse Micro chips went into production in Taiwan.

It is situated at the head of Necklace Valley, in the heart of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. La Bohn Peak is set west of La Bohn Lakes and La Bohn Gap, and one mile west of the crest of the Cascade Range. Precipitation runoff from the south side of the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River, whereas the north side drains into tributaries of the Foss River. The nearest higher neighbor is Mount Hinman, to the east, Little Big Chief Mountain is set to the south, and Iron Cap Mountain sits to the west. Climate La Bohn Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Police arrested 54-year-old Zdenƒõk Konopka, the suspected arsonist, in front of the building. According to police, Konopka, who had four prior criminal convictions, admitted to buying gasoline at a nearby petrol station and going to his son's flat. It was bustling with people who were celebrating a birthday party to which Konopka was not invited. It is alleged that he poured the gasoline in the hallway within the flat and then onto the entrance doors and set it ablaze. This led to the extremely fast spread of the fire throughout the flat with no escape route possible. The fire on the 11th story of the 13-story building killed a total of six people. Four people managed to save themselves by climbing through balconies to a nearby flat. Five more people, all of them already on fire, jumped to their deaths out of a window from a room without a balcony. Casualties included 3 children. Konopka's son, grandson, soon-to-be daughter-in-law and estranged wife all died. Konopka suffered burn wounds on his hands and legs. The attack is the worst mass murder in post-WW2 Czech history.  Timeline  Detail of the windows belonging to the burned out flat Authorities received multiple phone calls about the fire at 17:46/47. At 17:49, the fire department dispatched units from Bohum√≠n (1 fire engine + 1 ladder truck), Karvin√° (2 fire engines) and Orlov√° (1 fire engine + 1 ladder truck). Furthermore, the dispatcher called volunteer units from Bohum√≠n-≈†unychl (1 fire engine) and Star√Ω Bohum√≠n (1 fire engine) and a special high rise ladder truck from Ostrava. The building was first reached by units from Bohum√≠n and Star√Ω Bohum√≠n at 17:54 who immediately raced to the 11th floor to start rescue operations. Trucks from nearby Orlov√° reached the building at 18:01, volunteer units from Bohum√≠n-≈†unychl at 18:04 and units from 16 km-distant Karvin√° at 18:06. 28 firemen took part in the initial rescue operation, with more arriving afterwards for a total of 46 fire personnel with 9 fire engines and 3 ladder trucks. When firemen reached the building, the flat was already completely ablaze. Five people jumped out of a window to their deaths while a landing mattress was being prepared. The fire was under control at 18:30 and completely extinguished at 19:43.  Victims  Six people were killed in the fire and five more from falling for a total of eleven fatalities. Nine people were rescued from other flats. Fifteen people needed medical attention, ten of them requiring transfer to a hospital. Among the injured were two firemen. A volunteer firefighter inhaled smoke and a professional firefighter suffered serious burns to the neck. Media identified the following victims: * Luk√°≈° Konopka (30), suspect's son * Dominik (9), suspect's grandson * Lenka V. (30), suspect's soon-to-be daughter-in-law who was celebrating 30th birthday * Silvia (53), suspect's estranged wife and Luk√°≈° Konopka's mother * Jana (73), suspect's mother-in-law * Nikola G. (17, 8 months pregnant), Lenka V.'s sister, who fell out of the window after lengthy effort to hold onto its ledge * Melinka (11) Wounded victims who managed to climb through balconies to neighbour's flat: * Rostislav, who was in bathroom during initial blaze, suffered serious burns * ≈Ωaneta, mother of victims Lenka and Nikola, who was with Rostislav in bathroom during initial blaze, suffered serious burns * Jakub A., partner of victim Nikola * Pavel  Suspect  Police arrested 54-year-old Zdenƒõk Konopka in front of the building and two days later charged him with multiple murder and public endangerment. According to the remand request filed by State Attorney Michal Kr√≥l, Konopka had planned the attack in advance. He consumed alcohol in order to strengthen his resolve, filled two plastic bottles with gasoline at a nearby petrol station, and went towards the flat with full knowledge of the birthday party that was taking place inside. Konopka stood in front of the entrance doors with open bottles of gasoline in each hand and rang the doorbell. A female, whose name was withheld in the publicly released remand request, opened the doors. Thereafter, Konopka threw one of the open bottles at the female victim, who reacted by slamming the doors shut. Konopka then poured the remaining gasoline onto the doors, with some of it pouring under the doors into the flat, and set it on fire. Konopka suffered burn wounds on his hands and legs. He went outside where he was confronted by the police and immediately arrested. The Karvin√° district court ordered his remand on 11 August. If convicted, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment. Konopka had four prior criminal convictions, two of them for violent crimes. He was known for aggressiveness as well as high consumption of alcohol. Several weeks before the arson attack, Konopka threatened his wife and son with a gas pistol at a nearby lake. Police didn't seek Konopka's remand at the time as the weapon used was not suitable to cause injury (Konopka could not legally possess a real firearm due to his criminal record, see Gun laws in the Czech Republic). After the incident, Konopka's wife moved to the son's flat. Police investigation into this incident was still open at the time of the arson attack.  Police response  Initial investigations conducted by the police revealed that the fire was deliberately set and concluded the incident was an arson attack. The motive was said to be a conflict within the family. Police officials detained Konopka, who is accused in connection with the incident, and during an interview with ƒåesk√° televize, regional police chief Tom√°≈° Ku≈æel compared the incident to the 2013 Fren≈°t√°t pod Radho≈°tƒõm explosion which eventually killed seven people.  Other mass murders  The attack is the worst mass murder in post-WW2 Czech history (see list of massacres). Other mass murders in the Czech Republic in the past decade include the 2013 Harok family murder and , the 2015 Uhersk√Ω Brod shooting and the 2019 Ostrava hospital attack. The January 2020 Vejprty care center fire was also started deliberately according to investigators, however no one has been charged with causing 8 deaths therein yet.

By pronouncing the phrase, Macri sought to release the government from any responsibility regarding the country's crisis, stating that it was the product of a greater worldwide situation, in which the world was in a \\"very volatile financial situation\\", remainings of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The unexpected phrase drew national attention and widespread criticism of the opposition and the middle class. Following harsh criticism, it became an overnight internet meme, national shame of the population, which the term was used as an analogy to a feeling of control and overconfidence of someone, then unexpectedly loses control of the situation, ending with a unexpected ending, or a quick end-a-relationship quote; shaming through the media, such as television programs or newspapers; spawning mocks internet page; a strong impact on the social network Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, becoming a popular national Twitter trend and Twitter accounts; a radio program; a Spotify podcast of current Argentine events; T-shirt sales; and YouTube sketch videos.  Background  During his period as head of government of the city of Buenos Aires during his term (2007-2015), Mauricio Macri, leader of the Republican Proposal centre-right political party (PRO), had pointed out Argentina's inflation on numerous occasions as one of the main shortcomings of the previous two national governments of the Frente para la Victoria (FpV), a centre-left political party led first by N√©stor Kirchner's term, and then by his wife, Cristina Kirchner, during 2003 until 2015. During an interview in an Argentine TV program in 30 January 2014, Macri, seen at the time as a potential candidate for the presidency, affirmed that high inflation was a \\"demonstration of management inability\\". But on 8 February 2015, during an interview with Canal 26, Macri declared that eliminating inflation would be \\"the simplest thing he would have to do\\" if he were to be elected president, he went so far as to promise below-digit inflation by the end of 2017. After his victory in the 2015 Argentine general election and after four months in the office, on 20 March 2016, he affirmed that, if inflation does not went down, his government would take full responsibility and \\"blame no one.\\" During his term, however, inflation continued to rise steadily. During the first half of his term, and despite his previous comments, Macri declared that the inability to reduce inflation wasn't the responsibility of his term, but of various \\"external problems\\". With this, at the beginning of 2018, after ending 2017 with an inflation of 24.8%, the government changed its economic goals: from 10% in 2018 to 15%, and from 5% in 2019 to 10% but during the second quarter of 2018, a currency crisis unleashed, which led to the collapse of the value of the Argentine peso, the increase in country risk to the second highest in the world and interest rates, becoming one of the highest of the world with 40%, followed far behind by Suriname (25%), Venezuela (21.7%) and Haiti (20%). The failure of the vain measures taken by the president of the Central Bank of Argentina, Federico Sturzenegger, to combat the crisis, finally led to his resignation on 14 June 2018, Sturzenegger commented that, in his opinion, the reasons given by the president and summarized in the clumsy expression of \\"things happened\\" did not cause the crisis, but \\"the fault lies in the policies that were decided. The deterioration of fiscal policy first, and then the choice to bet on short-term growth, even at the expense of monetary institutions and inflation.\\"  Interview  After Sturzenegger's resignation, Macri granted an interview with journalist Jorge Lanata on the investigative program Periodismo para todos, which was broadcast on 17 June 2018. Lanata asked him if there had been intentional operations in the market to detonate the crisis, to which Macri denied. The president compared the economic model of the previous Kirchner government with the Venezuelan failure and affirmed that the model of his government \\"respected the rules\\" as \\"another country in the world.\\" In the first forty seconds of the interview, which lasted approximately twenty-two minutes, the phrase occurred: Spanish version: > Lanata: ......del otro lado ten√©s un mont√≥n de gente preocupada por c√≥mo > cerr√≥ el d√≥lar el viernes [15 de junio] y una sensaci√≥n ‚Äîque no s√© si es > real, vos me dir√°s‚Äî como de pulseada con el gobierno, de \\"a ver qui√©n gana y > qui√©n pierde\\" esta historia. ¬øTiene nombre eso? ¬øHay gente que est√° operando > en el mercado ‚Äîgente concreta‚Äî que est√° operando en el mercado para > presionar el d√≥lar y que suba? > > Macri: No, puede haber, por supuesto, mucha gente que quiere que las cosas > vuelvan para atr√°s, pero esto es m√°s profundo, y a la vez... superficial.

No, diciendo \\"voy a jugar > el mundial de f√∫tbol con catorce jugadores\\", como hac√≠a el gobierno > anterior, \\"yo invento de vuelta las reglas del mundo\\". No. Nosotros... somos > uno m√°s.

And we were doing well, but > suddenly things happened, because the world is also volatile. And it > increased ... a change of president [sic], the dollar depreciated, interest > rates increased, oil increased, we are still net importers of energy...  Aftermath  The phrase was the subject of numerous criticisms from the entire population, mainly from the peronist opposition and the overwhelmed and impoverished middle class, including a press release from an independent intellectual group \\"La Fragata\\", which it quickly became an internet meme. After a year of the phrase, some Argentine media continued to remember the expression and used it to criticize their government. A radio program hosted by economist Alejandro Bercovich on the station Radio con Vos, a current radio channel, launched on 11 September 2018 bears the name Pasaron cosas as a reminder of the president's phrase and the stunned reaction of the population, even his followers. In addition, Macri's phrase served as a title for a book of social criticism by Argentine announcer, humorist and influencer Pedro Rosenblat, as well as being a subject of study as an example of the \\"failure of Argentine neoliberalism\\", adding that it was too early for a centre-right government to wipe out \\"70 years of Peronist political control\\", since Macri was the first democratic elected president in almost a century who wasn't either a Radical or a Peronist. Since then, the phrase is usually used in the media or social networks to refer to a negative turn of events for a person or entity that occurs suddenly, after a period prolonged do of prosperity or advantage, seen in the first half of his term. During the 2019 elections, he was considered the worst candidate in the entire election, based on deep disgust of the public opinion. When he lost the election, he left office with of the lowest popularity ratings in the history of Argentina, with 38%. During a survey, he was considered as the second worst president in the Argentine history, only surpassed by Cristina Kirchner.

In the highest levels of cricket, bowling sides are expected to achieve a minimum over rate. Bowling teams that have failed to achieve the minimum over rate have had points deducted, the players fined, or the captain suspended for future matches. It has been suggested that penalty runs could be imposed. Minimum levels In Test cricket, bowling sides are expected to bowl a minimum of 15 overs per hour. In ODIs, bowling sides are expected to bowl the 50 overs in 3.5 hours, equivalent to a minimum over rate of 14.28 overs per hour.

Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2013. Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2019.  Medical uses  Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase is indicated for adjuvant treatment of adults with HER2 overexpressing node positive or node negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature; and it is indicated in combination with paclitaxel for first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.  History  Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase (Herceptin SC) was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2013. Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase (Herceptin Hylecta) was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2019. Approval of trastuzumab/hyaluronidase was based on two randomized trials, HannaH (NCT00950300) and SafeHER (NCT01566721). In HannaH, 596 participants with HER2-positive operable or locally advanced breast cancer, including inflammatory breast cancer, were randomized to receive 8 cycles of either trastuzumab/hyaluronidase or intravenous trastuzumab concurrently with chemotherapy, followed by surgery and continued therapy with either trastuzumab/hyaluronidase or intravenous trastuzumab, for an additional 10 cycles. HannaH demonstrated comparability between trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and intravenous trastuzumab based on co- primary endpoints of pathologic complete response and pharmacokinetics. Pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 118 participants (45.4%) on the trastuzumab/hyaluronidase arm and in 107 participants (40.7%) receiving intravenous trastuzumab (95% CI for difference in pCR: -4.0; 13.4). SafeHER was a prospective, two-cohort, non-randomized, multinational, open-label trial assessing the overall safety and tolerability of trastuzumab/hyaluronidase with chemotherapy in 1,864 participants with HER2-positive breast cancer. Participants received a fixed dose of 600 mg trastuzumab/hyaluronidase every 3 weeks for 18 cycles. trastuzumab/hyaluronidase was initiated either sequentially with chemotherapy, concurrently with chemotherapy, or without adjuvant chemotherapy, or in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab.

Career She wrote an article titled \\"The Almoner Department in the Royal Newcastle Hospital\\" in the Australian Journal of Social Work in the year 1950 that detailed the work of an almoner in all areas of medicine, as well as in the community. Parbery worked with geriatrician Richard Gibson in the Hunter Region during the 1950s, specialising in the care of people with multiple sclerosis and the aged with a disability. They produced a report on domiciliary, nursing, and medical care, which was supported by the Christian McCaffrey (RNH) medical superintendent and the hospital board. A model developed by Parbery and Gibson saw aged patients receive care and rehabilitation in their own homes, known as the domiciliary care service and retraining unit. Parbery's social work was crucial in establishing this innovative geriatric service (also known as the ‚ÄòNewcastle Experience‚Äô), an approach to domiciliary care that influenced practices in Australia and around the world. she was senior medical social worker at the RNH from 1969 until her retirement in 1973.

He was the originator and creator of numerous artistic projects outside the region. In 1993, he has been designated as Honorary Citizen of Bydgoszcz. He was awarded the highest state orders for his contribution to Polish culture.  Biography  Warsaw Conservatory, prior the Uprising Building of the Pomeranian Philharmonic Jezuicka Street BWA building with the connection to the Pomeranian Arts House on the left Building of the Bydgoszcz Music Academy Ostromecko old palac where is exhibited the 'Szwalbe piano collection''  Pre-war period  Andrzej Szwalbe was born on 30 June 1923 in Warsaw. His mother was Eufemia n√©e Sobieraj and his father Sylwester Jan Szwalbe. The latter worked as a tax clerk. His mother had a pivotal influence in the way Andrzej led his life: she believed that his duty was to serve his homeland in the field of high culture and thus fulfill his life as an important mission. She loved him in reading difficult books on national, social and philosophical topics. Andrzej studied in Warsaw at Miko≈Çaj Rej Secondary school No. XI and Adam Mickiewicz Secondary school No.IV. Encouraged by his mother all the time to develop and take on self-discipline, which is why he attended, among others, the music school at Chopin University of Music, where he was a piano student in the class of Prof. Pawe≈Ç Lewicki. There he met later famous Polish musicians, such as Witold Lutos≈Çawski. During the occupation, while he has been completing his first year of law studies at the University of Warsaw, he also worked as a messenger. In 1944, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Germans in the internment camp 121 of Pruszk√≥w: from here he escaped to Krakow. Polish People's Republic years  After WWII, Szwalbe lived in Ciechocinek but soon he moved from there to Bydgoszcz. In 1948, he graduated from law studies at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ and for three years he worked at the university on differents positions: assistant, lecturer and head of the Human resources department. However, he put more enthusiasm to become a cultural activist than to develop his career of lawyer. In 1949, he made himself known to the public by giving a spontaneous speech during a concert of the Pomeranian Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra (the ancestor of the Pomeranian Philharmonic) at the Bydgoszcz Chamber theatre on Grodzka Street for a petition demanding not to abandon the Orchestra. With the thousands signatures he collected, Szwalbe went to the administrative authorities to make his point. This happening made him a recognizable figure in the local society. In 1951, he was appointed administrative director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra. A year later, his efforts were rewarded, as by a decision of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage on 15 December 1952, the Pomeranian Symphony Orchestra, operating since 1946, in recognition of its high level and merits in the promotion of music, was nationalized on 1 January 1953, taking the name of Ignacy Jan Paderewski Pomeranian Philharmonic: Andrzej Szwalbe was designated as the head of the Social Committee for the Construction of the Philharmonic (). The building was erected three years later, with an inaugural concert performed on 16 November 1956, broadcast on the Polish Radio. The architecture of the newly built edifice in Bydgoszcz, designed by Stefan Klajbor, referred to the National Philharmonic in Warsaw. In the following years, he carried out new projects with passion: * he co- initiated with Marian Turwid the Bydgoszcz Scientific Society () in 1959; * he was the initiator of the erection of the Opera Nova (opened in 2006) in the city. At the start of the works (1973), Szwalbe was for many years the direct manager of the project; * in 1961, he launched a publishing series at the Pomeranian Philharmonic, entitled The history of Polish music in Pomerania (). He initiated the establishment in Bydgoszcz of a branch of the Scientific and Research Station of the Institute of Musicology from the University of Warsaw: in coordination with both institutions and the Bydgoszcz Scientific Society, he conducted extensive scientific activity. Together with Stanis≈Çaw Ga≈Ço≈Ñski, a music director and musicologist from Krakow, Andrzej Szwalbe established in 1962, the Capella Bydgostiensis, one of the leading Polish chamber orchestra dedicated to Early Music. A year later, he inaugurated the Polish Music Festival, which transformed later on into the Bydgoszcz Music Festival (). In 1966, with the help of musicologist Zofia Lissa and prof. Hieronim Feicht (then manager of the Polish music department at the University of Warsaw), Szwalbe set up the international festivals and musicological congresses, Musica Antiqua Europae Orientalis (MAEO), which have become today a recognized event in Europe and contributed to the increased visibility and popularity of music from Central and Eastern Europe in the world. The achievements of the scientific congresses partnering the MAEO sessions were compiled in several books (e.g. Acta Scientifica) and through the publishing series Monumenta MAEO, promoting Polish music and culture worldwide. In 1970, thanks to his efforts, a new gallery for the Municipal Art Gallery BWA was erected at 20 Gda≈Ñska Street. He played a decisive role in opening in 1974, a Bydgoszcz branch of the Academy of Music in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, which became afterwards an independent institution, the Bydgoszcz Music Academy - \\"Feliks Nowowiejski\\". To house the latter, Szwalbe took control in 1975, of the historic building of the Prussian administrative region, located at the corner of S≈Çowackiego and 20 Stycznia 1920 streets. Taking specific care to the high artistic level of Bydgoszcz ensembles of the Philharmonic, Andrzej Szwalbe commissioned outstanding Polish composers to write dedicated works, such as the piece for baritone and orchestra, Gray Fog () by Wojciech Kilar. He intented the Philharmonic to be a cultural melting-pot, combining music with various art disciplines. To this end, over the years, he built several collections inside the building of the Pomeranian Philharmonic, all related to music: * a gallery of sculptural portraits of musicians; * a tapestry collection; * a unique collection of 18th and 19th centuries pianos. Nowadays, the Andrzej Szwalbe Collection is visible in nearby Ostromecko palace. He also made his vision of a Music District in Bydgoszcz a reality by adroitly developing the area around the seat of the Philharmonic, through installing in the neighbourhood cultural and educational institutions (i.e Bydgoszcz Music Academy - \\"Feliks Nowowiejski\\", Music Schools Group, Jan Kochanowski Park). In particular, the park harbours a outdoor gallery of monuments to composers and virtuosos. At the beginning of the 1980s, he came up with the idea of restoring the splendor and culture- centric functions to nearby palaces of Ostromecko and Lubostro≈Ñ. In the former, he set up a gallery of Polish contemporary paintings and graphics from Tadeusz Brzozowski. He envisionned the Palace and park ensemble in Ostromecko to fulfill the role of a Bydgoszcz Wilan√≥w. He expanded the cultural life in Bydgoszcz with consistency, foresight and optimism. He was deeply emotionally connected with the city.  Third Polish Republic  After retiring in 1991, and handing over the directoring of the Philharmonic to Eleonora Harendarska, he kept being keenly interested in cultural life, speaking on many issues, both locally and nationally. He was awarded the title of Honorary Director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic and received in 1993, the title of Honorary Citizens of Bydgoszcz. Andrzej Szwalbe was a modest and very hardworking man, a lover of art and music. He was able to successfully implement his visions and dreams in difficult times (Polish People's Republic) while overshadowing his merits, not caring about any personal benefits. He was an outstanding creator of culture in Bydgoszcz, but also a person of merit for Polish culture: Szwalbe's vision, consistency in action, mediation skills, as well as great erudition and even greater modesty were always emphasized. His closest musical friends, outstanding Polish composers (Wojciech Kilar, Henryk Miko≈Çaj G√≥recki, Krzysztof Penderecki) talked about him as a showcase of Bydgoszcz culture. Andrzej Szwalbe died suddenly on 11 November 2002 in Bydgoszcz, surviving only one month to his wife, Dobros≈Çawa. He was buried in the Catholic cemetery of the Sacred Heart of Jesus at 2 Ludwikowo street in Bydgoszcz.  Awards and recognitions  On 18 March 1993 the City Council awarded him the title of Honorary Citizen of Bydgoszcz. It was the first Honorary Citizen title awarded since 1945. During his lifetime, Andrzej Szwalbe had two books wrote about himself: Andrzej Szwalbe ‚Äì portret niedoko≈Ñczony () by Adam Bezwi≈Ñski and ≈ªycie na prze≈Çomie () by Krystyna Starczak-Koz≈Çowska. He also had a bronze bust chiseled by artist Micha≈Ç Kubiak, which is now exhibited inside the Philarmonic building. On 19 April 2007 Kubiak created a life-size statue of Szwalbe, standing today on the main square of Philarmonic. On 30 June 2003 a commemorative plaque was unveiled on the tenement house where Andrzej Szwalbe lived at 75 Dworcowa Street. Since 2007, he is the patron of the Primary School No.67 in Bydgoszcz. A street in downtown Bydgoszcz, next to the Philharmonic Hall and the Music School ensemble was renamed in his honor. The collection of old and historic pianos in Ostromecko Palace is now exhibited as The Andrzej Szwalbe Collection. On 18 January 2013 the Andrzej Szwalbe \\"Heritage\\" association () has been launched. Its goal is to gather people who are close to the ideas and activities of Andrzej Szwalbe, as a \\"visionary in the domain of the culture and science\\", not only in Bydgoszcz but also in the entire region. Honors * Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, awarded posthumously by the decision of president Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski on 15 November 2002, for outstanding services to the national culture; * Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta, awarded in 1996, for outstanding services to the Polish culture; * Golden Cross of Merit in 1955, on the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic of Poland for merits in the field of culture and art.

Crossing over the Manzanares, it is part of the , that eventually becomes the A-42 (the motorway to Toledo) south of the river.  History and description  An original bridge built circa 1925 was chiefly used for the transport of cattle to the slaughterhouse (Matadero) of Legazpi, so it was informally known as puente del Matadero. In 1932, the Ayuntamiento de Madrid determined to name it after the city of Prague (Praga in Spanish). However, building works for a new bridge started in the 1940s. Upon the time for the inauguration of the second bridge, it was determined it would be named puente de los H√©roes del Alc√°zar de Toledo, yet pretty much everybody sticked to the Praga name of the old bridge. It was finally opened to traffic in the Summer of 1952. As there were problems in the foundation works and the quality of the materials was deficient, authorities determined the demolition of the bridge in 1964, to replace it by a new one. The bridge was progressively dismantled as the new one was being built, and the formal unveiling of the third version of the bridge took place on 11 October 1968. The new (third) bridge consisted of four straight sections of prestressed concrete, with about 45 m of maximum span, and with a board supported by 8 longitudinal beams (with a height of 2.70 m) per section. Aside from the board the longitudinal beams are also braced by crossbeams. In 2009 the bridge was officially renamed to Puente de Praga, as still nobody knew the bridge by the H√©roes del Alc√°zar de Toledo name, and the Praga name already was featured even in city guides and street maps.

Before Shi Le decided to execute them all, he noticed the price Sima Fan (Âè∏È¶¨ÁØÑ) who was the only one of the prisoners who kept a calm expression. Shi Le asked Kong Chang for his advice, whether he should recruit Fan into his ranks. Kong Chang disagreed, telling him, \\"They are princes and nobles of Jin, one and all.

He gathered his generals to plan out his next move as Sima Rui's army approached. Kong Chang and Zhi Xiong recommended that they launch a night raid on Shouchun before breaking through Danyang. Shi Le considered it but at the advice of Zhang Bin, he decided to abandon the campaign to shift his focus to Yecheng, although he did carry out an attack on Shouchun to demoralise the Jin army.(Â≠îËêá„ÄÅÊîØÈõÑÁ≠â‰∏âÂçÅÈ§òÂ∞áÈÄ≤Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂèäÂê≥ËªçÊú™ÈõÜÔºåËêáÁ≠âË´ãÂêÑÂ∞á‰∏âÁôæÊ≠•ÂçíÔºå‰πòËàπ‰∏âÂçÅÈ§òÈÅìÔºåÂ§úÁôªÂÖ∂ÂüéÔºåÊñ¨Âê≥Â∞áÈ†≠ÔºåÂæóÂÖ∂ÂüéÔºåÈ£üÂÖ∂ÂÄâÁ±≥„ÄÇ‰ªäÂπ¥Ë¶ÅÁï∂Á†¥‰∏πÈôΩÔºåÂÆöÊ±üÂçóÔºåÁõ°ÁîüÁ∏õÂèñÂè∏È¶¨ÂÆ∂ÂÖíËº©„ÄÇ„ÄçÂãíÁ¨ëÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊòØÂãáÂ∞á‰πãË®à‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂêÑË≥úÈéßÈ¶¨‰∏ÄÂåπ„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 104 As Shi Le returned north, his army continued to suffer from hunger, some even resorting to cannibalism.

Kong Chang led troops against Mopei and retreated back to the city where Mopei was tricked into pursuing and was captured. Duan Jilujuan retreated and Kong striked a successful counter attack as they fled, ending the siege.(ÂãíÈ°ßË¨ÇÂºµË≥ì„ÄÅÂ≠îËêáÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêõ‰ª•ÁÇ∫‰ΩïÂ¶Ç„ÄçË≥ì„ÄÅËêá‰ø±Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËÅûÂ∞±ÂÖ≠Áú∑Ââã‰æÜÊúà‰∏äÊó¨ÈÄÅÊ≠ªÂåóÂüéÔºåÂÖ∂Â§ßË°ÜÈÅ†‰æÜÔºåÊà∞ÂÆàÈÄ£Êó•Ôºå‰ª•ÊàëËªçÂã¢ÂØ°Âº±ÔºåË¨Ç‰∏çÊï¢Âá∫Êà∞ÔºåÊÑèÂøÖÊáàÊÄ†„ÄÇ‰ªäÊÆµÊ∞èÁ®ÆË°Ü‰πãÊÇçÔºåÊú´Êü∏Â∞§ÊúÄÔºåÂÖ∂Âçí‰πãÁ≤æÂãáÔºåÊÇâÂú®Êú´Êü∏ÊâÄÔºåÂèØÂãøÂæ©Âá∫Êà∞ÔºåÁ§∫‰πã‰ª•Âº±„ÄÇÈÄüÈëøÂåóÂ£òÁÇ∫Á™ÅÈñÄ‰∫åÂçÅÈ§òÈÅìÔºåÂÄôË≥äÂàóÂÆàÊú™ÂÆöÔºåÂá∫ÂÖ∂‰∏çÊÑèÔºåÁõ¥Ê≤ñÊú´Êü∏Â∏≥ÔºåÊïµÂøÖÈúáÊÉ∂ÔºåË®à‰∏çÂèäË®≠ÔºåÊâÄË¨ÇËøÖÈõ∑‰∏çÂèäÊé©ËÄ≥„ÄÇÊú´Êü∏‰πãË°ÜÊó£Â•îÔºåÈ§òËá™ÊëßÊï£„ÄÇÊìíÊú´Êü∏‰πãÂæåÔºåÂΩ≠Á•ñÂèØÊåáËæ∞ËÄåÂÆö„ÄÇ„ÄçÂãíÁ¨ëËÄåÁ¥ç‰πãÔºåÂç≥‰ª•ËêáÁÇ∫ÊîªÊà∞ÈÉΩÁù£ÔºåÈÄ†Á™ÅÈñÄ‰∫éÂåóÂüé„ÄÇÈÆÆÂçëÂÖ•Â±ØÂåóÂ£òÔºåÂãíÂÄôÂÖ∂Èô£Êú™ÂÆöÔºåË∫¨ÁéáÂ∞áÂ£´ÈºìÂô™‰∫éÂüé‰∏ä„ÄÇÊúÉÂ≠îËêáÁù£Ë´∏Á™ÅÈñÄ‰ºèÂÖµ‰ø±Âá∫Êìä‰πãÔºåÁîüÊìíÊú´Êü∏ÔºåÂ∞±ÂÖ≠Áú∑Á≠âË°ÜÈÅÇÂ•îÊï£„ÄÇËêá‰πòÂãùËøΩÊìäÔºåÊûïÂ∞∏‰∏âÂçÅÈ§òÈáåÔºåÁç≤ÈéßÈ¶¨‰∫îÂçÉÂåπ„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 104 In 313, Kong Chang was sent to capture Dingling (ÂÆöÈôµÁ∏£) in Yingchuan Commandery which was under Wang Jun.

Dating from 1914‚Äì1918, it was built for Thomas Evans, a colliery owner, by Charles Edward Mallows. The house reputedly cost ¬£100,000. Craig-y-parc is a Grade II* listed building. The garden and park surrounding the house has its own Grade II* listing and is a designated conservation area. The house now operates as a residential school for children and young adults with disabilities. History Thomas Evans began his career as a railwayman. Known as \\"Small Coal Evans\\", he reputedly made his fortune by collecting coal that had fallen from coal trucks operating on the railways in the South Wales Coalfield. By 1940, he held a CBE, was the Chairman of the Cardiff Coal and Shipping Exchange, Vice-Chairman of the Ocean Coal Company and a Justice of the peace for Glamorganshire. In 1914, Evans commissioned Charles Edward Mallows to build a house some seven miles north of Cardiff in woods close to the village of Pentyrch. Mallows, who died the year after work had begun, was an architect in the Arts and Crafts style, much influenced by Edwin Lutyens. His major work was Tirley Garth in Cheshire, another Lutyenseque house for another rich industrialist. Mallows also had full responsibility for the design of the gardens surrounding the house, which he laid out to an Arts and Crafts- influenced design. The whole reputedly cost Evans a sum in excess of ¬£100,000. Following Evans' death in 1943, Craig-y-parc came into the possession of the National Coal Board before being sold in 1954 to the Spastics Society which opened a residential school at the site in 1955. The school continues to provide residential care for children and young adults with disabilities, operated by Salutem Healthcare. Architecture and description Craig-y-parc is a large mansion with the entrance front to the north, and the garden front, onto which all the main receptions rooms face, to the south. The architectural historian John Newman, in his Glamorgan volume of the Buildings of Wales, notes the strong influence of Lutyens. This is seen particularly in the lodge, and in the north frontage, which Newman compares to Little Thakeham. He admires Mallow's originality on the garden front, where a row of columns forms an arcade. The house is constructed of locally-quarried stone, with granite dressings. The house is listed at Grade II*. The gardens are also listed at II*, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. The listing record notes their \\"strongly axial design\\" and considers them \\"a very good example of [an] architectural Edwardian garden\\". The loggia, and the garden terrace have their own Grade II* listings, while the lodge, and the walls and gate piers at the courtyard entrance are listed Grade II.

It was founded on 1 January 1996. History Besides areas that used to be part of the Weststadt- borough (Hardtwaldsiedlung a housing cooperative, founded in the 1920s), large parts of today's borough consist of the former United States Army Smiley Barracks (Originally built in 1937 as the Forstner-Kaserne) and the American Paul Revere Village housing area (founded in 1951). For that reason most streets, in what used to be Paul Revere Village, still carry the name of U.S. states. After the US forces left Karlsruhe in 1995 new apartment building were erected and existing apartment buildings renovated with storeys being added. The newly constructed Smiley West housing estate (nickname \\"Legoland\\") was built adjacent to the former Smiley Barracks. Education The former Karlsruhe American Elementary School is now home of the Maryland Grundschule and the former Karlsruhe American High School to an independent school, the Heisenberg-Gymnasium. In 1995 the Duale Hochschule Baden-W√ºrttemberg Karlsruhe moved to an area close to the former airfield. Religious Life The catholic Herz-Jesu-Church, originally founded in 1924 as a temporary structure, is located south of the Hardtwaldsiedlung housing cooperative.

Tom Ivens was born on 22 May 1921 in Northampton and studied at Northampton Grammar School and Seale-Hayne Agricultural College. Between 1944 and 1947 he was in command of naval minesweepers.Stillwater Fly-Fishing by T C Ivens 4th edition, Pan Books (1973) He was on the staff of the Fishing Gazette from 1953 to 1956. Fly Fishing in England and Wales Although fishing on rivers in England goes back many centuries (Dame Juliana Berners wrote on the subject in 1486A Treatise of Fysshynge wyth an Angle by Dame Juliana Berners, Wynkyn de Worde edition (1496)), fly fishing on stillwaters has a more recent history. It began at the turn of the twentieth century with the construction of the water supply reservoirs which were stocked with trout; the first ones being Thrybergh Reservoir around 1880, Lake Vyrnwy in 1891, Ravensthorpe Reservoir in 1895, and Blagdon Lake in 1904.Reservoir Trout Flies by Adrian V W Freer, Crowood Press (2010) page 13 In the early days English reservoir fly anglers copied the method currently being used on the Scottish lochs of employing large and colourful ‚Äòfancy‚Äô flies that were retrieved quickly in an attempt to attract the attention of the trout. There was, in general, little attempt to imitate the trout‚Äôs natural food.Lake Flies and their Imitation by C F Walker, Herbert Jenkins (1960) pages 17-22 That is how things stood until Dr Bell of Wrington began to fish Blagdon Lake in 1920, shortly after his return from WW1. Dr Bell and adopted a different approach by studying the natural creatures and mimicking them in both form and movement.Dr Bell of Wrington by Adrian V W Freer, Welford Court Press (2019) page 29 When Tom Ivens returned from WW2 he took a similar line, by offering flies that the trout would take as food. Reservoir fly fishing Reservoir Trout Fly Patterns designed by T C Ivens from his original series dated around mid-1960 [Top left to bottom right} Brown & Green Nymph, Brown Nymph, Black & Peacock Spider, Green & Yellow Nymph, Green Nymph, Jersey Herd, Alexandra, Pretty Pretty With the increased interest in reservoir fly fishing at the end of World War 2 Tom Ivens published Stillwater Fly-Fishing in 1952,Stillwater Fly- Fishing by TC Ivens, Andre Deutsch (1952) which ran to four editions, and he became one of the most influential fly anglers of the time.Reservoir Trout Fishing with Tom Saville by Tom Saville, H F & G Witherby (1991) page 21 In the first edition he introduced his original series of reservoir fly patterns that have since become standards. Ivens‚Äô philosophy regarding fly selection was based on fish behaviour and he proposed that ‚Äòexact imitation‚Äô on reservoirs was unnecessary and that ‚Äògeneral representations‚Äô, to suggest a range of food creatures, should form the first line of attack whenever possible.Stillwater Fly-Fishing by T C Ivens 2nd edition, Andre Deutsch (1963) chapter 5 Ivens stressed the importance of long distance casting and favoured the use of slowly recovered ‚Äòdeceiver‚Äô nymph fly patterns when the conditions allowed.The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing by Conrad Voss Bark & Eric Restall, Robert Hale Ltd (1992) page 124 His original series of flies included five nymph patterns,Tying and Fishing the Nymph by Taff Price, Blandford a Cassell imprint (1995) page 193 the best known being his Black & Peacock SpiderFlydressing by David J Collyer, David & Charles (1973) pages 143-144 which is still in common use today.

Supplementary Reservoir Trout Fly Patterns designed by T C Ivens [Top left to bottom right} Claret Buzzer, Black Buzzer, Green Buzzer, Cinnamon & Gold, Fuzzy Buzzy, Gentile, Hairwing Butcher, Polar Bear, Black Knight, Tandem Black & Peacock Spider Lure The opening of Grafham Water in 1966 brought about new problems for fly anglers due to its large size (and most importantly its depth) which resulted in stratification and trout which remained deep-down for much of the time. Ivens devised new methods to tackle these deep-lying fish and designed a supplementary series of flies to accompany the new techniques which were described in the third edition of his book in 1970.Stillwater Fly- Fishing by T C Ivens 3rd edition, Andre Deutsch (1970) chapters 16 and 17. Contribution to innovations in fly fishing tackle Davenport and Fordham Ltd of Ware, Hertfordshire produced a series of split-cane and later fibreglass fly rods designed by Tom Ivens bearing his name.Trout & Salmon magazine March 1968 issue page 45 To match the rods Davenport and Fordham introduced a range of 'Superflyte' shooting heads that were developed in conjunction with Ivens.Trout & Salmon magazine March 1970 issue page 38 Being able to deliver the flies a long distance is irrelevant if the leader does not turn over and straighten correctly. To facilitate leader turnover Tom Ivens developed a series of tapered and double-tapered nylon leaders appropriate for a variety of conditions.Stillwater Fly-Fishing by T C Ivens 3rd edition, Andre Deutsch (1970) pages 45-47 Advances in fly line design have to some extent negated this necessity today. The 'Stillwater' boat manufactured by Thanetcraft of New Malden, Surrey, designed in collaboration with Ivens, incorporated several unique features for a fishing boat: high seats for a better casting position that were well-spaced apart, fixing rings for the mooring ropes, anchors and drogues mounted on the exterior of the hull, and a snag-free interior to avoid fly line tangles.Trout & Salmon magazine April 1970 issue page 12 Later years and death Tom Ivens' legacy is best summed up in the words of Conrad Voss Bark in The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing as follows: 'His aim was to put reservoir fishing on as scientific and simple a basis as possible, and his book and his whole philosophy had an instant appeal to large numbers of men who were being attracted to reservoir fishing for the first time since World War II, as well as those who had previously been fishing traditional wet flies without knowing quite why.'The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing by Conrad Voss Bark & Eric Restall, Robert Hale Ltd (1992) page 124 Reservoir fly fishing has evolved considerably since then but the foundations laid in those early years are relevant today.

While little more than a skirmish, it had a significant effect on the local progress of the conflict. Leading Welsh Royalist Sir John Owen of Clenennau mustered a group of 250-300 cavalry and foot in an attempt to raise North Wales in rebellion against Parliament; he initially defeated a local force in a skirmish near Caernarfon. Colonel George Twisleton, Parliamentarian governor of Denbigh, confronted Owen at Y Dalar Hir on the shore of the Menai Straits near Llandegai. The Royalists were scattered and Owen captured, effectively ending the spread of the rebellion in North Wales. Background Sir John Owen of Clenannau; he began raising local forces in North Wales to support a larger Royalist revolt in Pembrokeshire. The First English Civil War had ended in 1646 with the defeat of Charles I's forces, but by 1648 divisions within Parliament and the army were threatening peace. Believing himself essential to any peace settlement, Charles had refused to compromise in negotiations; in December 1647 he made an agreement with representatives of the Scottish Parliament to restore him fully to the English throne in return for imposing a Presbyterian polity for three years. He expected backing from Presbyterian moderates in the English Parliament, while mutinous elements of the army also became drawn into the plan. The revolt began in Pembrokeshire, an area controlled by Parliament since early 1643. Like their colleagues in the New Model Army, the soldiers had not been paid for months, and feared being disbanded without their wages. In early March, John Poyer, Governor of Pembroke Castle, refused to relinquish command; he was joined by others including Rowland Laugharne. What began as a pay dispute became overtly political when the Welsh rebels made contact with Charles. Most Royalists had sworn not to bear arms against Parliament and did not participate, one exception being Sir Nicholas Kemeys, who held Chepstow Castle for the king. By the end of April, Laugharne had assembled around 8,000 troops, and was marching on Cardiff. In the interim North Wales Royalists attempted to expand the revolt. The north had been affected by the same pay issues as South Wales, while heavy taxation and a poor harvest in 1647 stoked local economic resentments. At the beginning of May, Sir John Owen, a Caernarfonshire landowner who had served as Royalist governor of Conwy Castle during the first war, began recruiting in Merioneth. Senior Royalist exile John Byron, who in March had been given a commission to raise men in his former command of North Wales by the Prince of Wales in anticipation of a Scots intervention, immediately left France for Anglesey on hearing of Owen's mobilisation. While small numbers were involved, Byron believed a guerrilla- type campaign in the north could assist the Pembrokeshire rebels by drawing away Parliament's resources. On arrival at Anglesey Byron found most local landowners unenthusiastic, but he and Owen continued recruitment efforts throughout May, \\"giving out many threatening speeches against the Parliament\\". In the south, Laugharne was defeated on 8th May at St Fagans, but the Royalists' retention of several fortresses encouraged them to continue. The garrison of Beaumaris under Captain Thomas Symkys joined the revolt, as did elements of the Anglesey Trained Bands. In mid-May Owen was reported at Dolgellau with about \\"100 reformados [former Royalist officers] where they quartered two nights\\"; Colonel George Twisleton at Denbigh sent patrols to search for Owen among the mountain passes, but the Royalists managed to evade them. The counties of Flintshire, Denbighshire and Montgomeryshire issued declarations that they would resist the rebels and \\"oppose [...] the disturbance of the peace of the Kingdome\\". Skirmish at Caernarfon The ward of Caernarfon Castle; Owen briefly besieged it in early June By the beginning of June Owen had raised a force of about 300. Thomas Mytton, governor of Caernarfon and senior Parliamentarian commander in the area, was anxious to crush the rising before it grew further and sent an urgent message to Twisleton at Denbigh requesting reinforcement. Twisleton and John Carter, governor of Conwy, gathered a scratch force of less than 200 men from their own garrisons and set out to relieve Mytton, dragging two small field guns with them. On 3rd June Owen clashed at Llandwrog with local militia under Mytton and William Lloyd, Sheriff of Caernarvonshire. Lloyd was seriously wounded and taken prisoner, while Owen briefly besieged Mytton in Caernarfon Castle; Mytton admitted that rumours of Owen's success made some consider joining the Royalists. In the meantime Twisleton and Carter were marching along the old Roman road through Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen: on receiving news of Twisleton's advance, Owen decided to intercept the relief force and give battle. He raised the siege, leaving a small number of men to blockade Mytton, and marched north-eastwards through Bangor: the wounded Lloyd died during the journey, allegedly of \\"neglect and ill-usage\\". Two days after the skirmish at Caernarfon, Owen encountered Twisleton on the shore of the Menai Straits at Y Dalar Hir, north-east of Llandegai. The battle Looking from the shoreline near Y Dalar Hir towards Beaumaris, held by the rebels at the time of the battle The fighting was marked with some confusion: the commanders had chosen similar \\"field-words\\" (\\"Resolution\\" for Owen, and \\"Religion\\" for Twisleton) and the same \\"field-sign\\", in that neither side wore scarfs or sashes. Both sides began the battle by charging with a forlorn hope, the Royalists having the better of the encounter. Owen then attacked the Parliamentarian horse, who were driven back in a disorderly retreat. Following his initial success Owen ordered the entire Royalist force to charge the Parliamentarian reserve; however Twisleton's men received and held the charge and after a fiercely contested action of about 30 minutes routed the Royalist cavalry. A Parliamentarian trooper, Captain Taylor, singled Owen out in the retreat and engaged him in hand-to-hand combat. Taylor broke his sword over Owen's head, wounding him, pulled him off his horse and took him prisoner. The loss of Owen caused the remaining Royalists to scatter. Parliamentarian accounts later claimed that 30 Royalists had been killed and 60 \\"private Soldiers\\" taken prisoner, along with Owen and several other officers. While some reports claimed as few as four Parliamentarian casualties, others suggest a figure of 30-40 dead on both sides. The Royalists were also accused of shooting three prisoners during the battle, in addition to the alleged murder of Lloyd. Aftermath Owen was initially held in Denbigh Castle, where there were several attempts to rescue him. On the night of 3rd July up to 60 Royalists scaled the outer walls using two ladders, but were spotted before getting through the inner gate: the majority surrendered although several escaped. Later in the month two of Owen's officers, Major John Dolben and Captain Charles Chambres, mounted another attempt: the diarist William Maurice wrote \\"aboute the 16th Dolbein and Chambers with their companye came before Denbigh castle, and in a bravado, discharged their pistols and wente away\\". He was later brought to London, where he was charged with treason, the violation of his articles of surrender, and the murder of Lloyd. At his trial in February 1649 he was condemned to death, but submitted a successful petition for reprieve: its success was variously attributed to the intervention of Cromwell, Ireton, and foreign ambassadors, as well as to the kidnapping of Griffith Jones of Castellmarch as a hostage by the Royalist captain Bartlet. While a number of North Wales Royalists remained in arms, Owen's defeat at Y Dalar Hir meant that the rebellion became largely confined to Anglesey. The Scots invasion was defeated in August at Preston; in September it was reported that Byron had departed Anglesey for Dublin, and at the end of the month Mytton and a mixed force of 1,500 crossed the Menai Straits to restore order. He defeated Royalist commander Richard Bulkeley on 1 October in the parkland around Red Hill House; Bulkeley retreated to Beaumaris Castle, but surrendered soon afterwards.

It is classified as one of the \\"Anglo-Ashanti Wars\\" according to historical evidence at the National Archives.  History  The Ashanti King or Asantehene (Osei Yaw Akoto) at that time, furious at the Ga-Adangbe for aiding the Fantes in the Asamankow War of 1824, proposed to punish them. He decided to pursue them, even if they escape into the belly of kanfra (a small flat fish). On 7 August 1826, the war began also known as the \\"Battle of Dodowa\\". However he met a coalition of other indigenous forces allied with the Ga-Adangbe of Prampram, Ningo and Ada people under their Monarch King Tackie Kome. British, Dutch and Danish forces all together not more than 60, aided in the war with new weapons after an attack on cape coast in July 1824.The Asantehene amassed an army of 40,000. An alliance of British with Ga-Adangbe, Fanti,Denkyira, Akwamu and Akyems at Katamanso near Dodowa faced the Asante army. The Akyems were led by the Okyehene, Nana Afia Dokuaa,the only woman ruler of a major state.. But the allied forces fought gallantly and overcame the Ashanti Army with a devastating victory which paralysed the Ashanti Empire and was a factor in the loss of its former glory. This contributed to the British power and prestige rise on the coast.The Ashantis held their position for nine hours (6 AM to 3 PM).  Effects of the war  The effects of the war included: * Smooth trading activities with less fear of invasion. * Unity of Ga-Adangbe. * Accra became famous and their influence spread. * Foreign countries and strangers traded with the coast for commercial purpose. = Historical facts = The King was made to swear an oath as the 'ka ntam' (Akan for swear), 'na su' (Akan for cry) = Corrupted into Katamanso.

Life and career Gregory Antiochos was born in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, some time around 1125. He hailed from an obscure family, but his father, whose name is unknown was sufficiently to found a small female convent at the Forum Bovis. Antiochos was apparently an only child, and received an excellent education under Nicholas Kataphloron (whose funeral oration he held in 1160), Nicholas Hagiotheodorites, and Eustathius of Thessalonica. Closely tied to the capital's intellectual circles, already before 1159 he abandoned a literary career in favour of entering the civil service, soon becoming a member of the central imperial bureaucracy. Before 1175 Antiochos was judge of the velon, and was sufficiently prominent to hold the funeral oration of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos () on 22 January 1181. His career under the subsequent regency and the regime of Andronikos I Komnenos () is unknown, but modern scholarship considers it plausible that he supported Anronikos, and was forced to resign under Isaac II Angelos (). Antiochos only reappears in as megas droungarios tes vigles, with the rank of protonobelissimohypertatos. His subsequent fate, and the date of his death, are unknown. He had numerous children, of whom the oldest became a monk. Works Antiochos left a varied corpus of letters, speeches, eulogies and epitaphs, which are an important source for contemporary Byzantine history. In his work, he appears \\"a defender not only of imperial omnipotence, but also of the senate; he favored 'democratic' phraseology but stood aloof from military commanders\\".

Her sister Muriel Knyvett married Sir Edmond Bell, as his second wife. Marriage & issue On 28 April 1603 she married Edmund Paston and in 1610 on the death of his grandfather they moved into his ancestral seat of Paston Hall in Paston, Norfolk. They had two sons. The Paston's hold on their inheritance was confused as her husband's grandfather, Sir William Paston, had placed his estate in a trust because his heir, Christopher Paston, was mentally ill having been declared insane in 1609. They were granted ¬£800 a year income from the trust. Her husband was \\"sickley\\" so in order to resolve the legal disputes she moved to London with her two sons in order to progress their case through the chancery courts. Letters Many of her letters survive, forming part of the famous Paston Letters. She wrote many letters including to her husband's brother in law Sir John Heveningham.

It took place during the Congress of Vienna, negotiations on the future of Europe following Napoleon's defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition. The long-serving French representative, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, wanted to end France's diplomatic isolation and reassure other powers it had renounced any revolutionary intentions. He was provided an opportunity to do so through the Polish-Saxon crisis, caused by Prussia attempting to annex much of Saxony, and Russia doing the same for Poland. Since such proposals were opposed by Britain and Austria, it allowed France to position itself as a supporter of legality, and divide the Four Powers. Talleyrand proposed the treaty to Lord Castlereagh and Klemens von Metternich, as a means of warning off Prussia and Russia. The three powers signed on 3 January 1815, agreeing to respond to an attack on any party with a field army of at least 120,000 infantry and 30,000 cavalry. However, the signatories had no real intention of going to war, and details of the treaty were deliberately leaked. As a result, Alexander I accepted the creation of a semi-independent Polish state; in February, Prussia agreed to a reduced allocation of 40% of Saxony. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Prussian contribution to the campaign was recognised by increasing this to 60%. Background  Representatives at the Congress of Vienna The Congress of Vienna brought together the European great powers in Austria to discuss the future of Europe following the defeat of France in the 1813-14 War of the Sixth Coalition. The principal allies of the Sixth Coalition, Britain, Austria, Prussia, Russia together with representatives from minor nations and the defeated power, France (now under the Bourbon Restoration) sat from September 1814. Among their decisions was the redrawing of national borders and spheres of influence; the creation of free navigation rights on international rivers and the establishment of diplomatic precedence. Disagreements between the Powers over the fate of the Kingdom of Saxony and the Duchy of Poland led to the so-called Polish-Saxon crisis. Prussia and Russia presented a joint plan to improve their position: Austria and Prussia would renounce any claims to Polish territory, with a new state established under Russian influence. In return, Prussia would receive most of Saxony. This was opposed by Austria and Britain, together with some of the minor powers, since they viewed this expansion as a threat to the balance of power. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord was concerned at the creation of a Prussia whose size would threaten both France and Austria, but also saw an opportunity to end French diplomatic isolation. It allowed him to position France as a supporter of legitimacy by claiming that ignoring the sovereign rights of Frederick Augustus I of Saxony would create a dangerous precedent. In November 1814, Alexander's brother Grand Duke Konstantin left Vienna for Warsaw, Prussian generals returned to Berlin, while Austria moved troops into Galicia. Soon after, the Russian military commander in Saxony, Nikolai Repnin- Volkonsky, handed the Prussians control of the civil administration, incorrectly claiming it had been approved by Austria and Britain.  Treaty  Prussia threatened to take the Saxon territory by force if negotiations did not grant it to them, despite the powers being formally part of the Quadruple Alliance. Talleyrand proposed to the British and Austrian representatives, Lord Castlereagh and Klemens von Metternich, that a defensive alliance should be signed to deter any Prussian aggression. It would also strengthen the neogiations against Russia's plan for Poland. Castlereagh and Metternich agreed and a formal treaty to this effect was signed on 3 January 1815. In signing, Castlereagh exceeded his mandate from the British cabinet, which required him to avoid any further war, but he did not expect it to end in conflict. The three signatories agreed to invite Bavaria, Hanover and the Netherlands to join if needed, as well as Hesse and Sardinia. In the event, this proved unnecessary, since news of the agreement forced Russia and Prussia to come to terms. Its provisions compelled France, Britain and Austria to come to one another's aid within six weeks of any attack, and provide a joint army of 120,000 infantry and 30,000 cavalry. With its small standing army, Britain was allowed to supply foreign troops in lieu, or subsidise any deficit by ¬£20 per infantryman or ¬£30 per cavalryman per year. All parties agreed not to make a separate peace treaty. Once agreed, news of the treaty was deliberately leaked to Tsar Alexander I of Russia as a form of intimidation. With the nation badly affected by years of war he relented and accepted the establishment of the semi-independent state of Congress Poland. Later, in February, Prussia also relented and accepted a reduced claim of 40% of the territory of Saxony. Austria was granted significant influence in Germany as head of the Federal Convention of the German Confederation. Having achieved its aims, the treaty was annulled on 8 February.  Waterloo and later  Boundaries agreed at the Congress of Vienna, including Congress Poland and a reduced Kingdom of Saxony. The German Confederation is outlined in red. Whilst the Congress was ongoing, on 1 March Napoleon returned to France from exile, won the French Army to his cause and deposed the Bourbon king, Louis XVIII. The great powers mobilised armies against him, including an Anglo-Dutch- Belgian force under the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian Army under Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher. In the Waterloo Campaign, Napoleon sought to defeat these two armies before reinforcements could arrive from Austria and Russia. Bl√ºcher's chief of staff, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, was deeply suspicious of Wellington, and particularly worried his perceived pro-Bourbon bias might jeopardise their primary responsibility to defend Prussia. Aware of this, Napoleon tried to increase tensions by sending him a complete copy of the secret treaty, although its existence and contents were already public knowledge. Wellington reassured the Prussians that if defeated, he would retreat eastwards towards Prussia, not the sea; backed up by sending Henry Hardinge as liaison officer, this seems to have resolved differences between the two parties. Another concern for Bl√ºcher was the reliability of his army, which included 16,000 Saxons who had previously served Napoleon. Following orders from Berlin, on 1-2 May they were split into those who would remain Saxon post-annexation, with the rest integrated into the Prussian Army. They refused to parade, chanting support for Frederick Augustus and Napoleon; at one point, Bl√ºcher was chased from his headquarters by a mob of Saxon grenadiers. The Saxons asked to serve under British command but Wellington refused, claiming he had enough problems dealing with the Belgians. After a Saxon regiment refused to salute him, Bl√ºcher ordered a number shot, disarmed the others and sent them home. The return of Napoleon restored cooperation between the members of the Quadruple Alliance. War had, in any case, been unlikely with Britain and Austria wary of allowing a French army to operate in Central Europe so soon after Napoleon's troops had conquered swathes of territory there. After the coalition victory at Waterloo the Prussian negotiating hand was strengthened and they pressed for a larger share of Saxony. It received some 60% of the territory, as well as the territories of the Rhineland, Swedish Pomerania, Posen and Thorn. In many ways, the Secret Treaty was a triumph for Talleyrand, who had ended French diplomatic isolation and divided the Quadruple Alliance. He also limited Prussian gains to areas of Saxony that were largely Catholic and thus harder for the Lutheran state to assimilate, or not contiguous to Prussia, such as the Rhineland. His support of Saxony, based on the principle of legitimacy and equilibrium, guaranteed French security while reinstating it as a key player in ensuring the balance of power. Prussia strengthened its position by signing the Holy Alliance with Russia and Austria on 26 September. Afterwards Metternich attempted to reinstate the Secret Treaty, Castlereagh considered this would cause a permanent division in Europe and refused. In November Castlereagh positioned the Quadruple alliance as a guarantor of the terms of the Congress, with ongoing conferences to ensure the \\"repose and prosperity of nations\\". The national boundaries set by the Congress, created a successful balance of power - the so-called Concert of Europe, and would remain more or less unchanged for the next 40 years.

It serves Monterosso al Mare, which is one of the five towns of the Cinque Terre. History The station was inaugurated on 24 October 1874, at the same time as the ‚Äì line. On 11 March 1918, the year in which the station was enlarged, an extension of the crossing loop was activated and, at the same time, a special cabin was installed at the new station to centralise the control of the signals. A double-track line was opened between Monterosso and on 15 January 1962, including a new station at Vernazza.Service order no 26 of 1962 The doubling towards , the last section of the line to remain single track, was not completed until 23 January 1970. It was in fact a particularly complex project, given the need to operate without interrupting operations on the line and the need to manage water flows above the line. The construction of a building to accommodate six staff dates back to this period. In June and July 2011, the station was also served by the Treni del Mare (\\"trains of the sea\\") managed by the private company Arenaways, which became bankrupt shortly afterwards.  Buildings and infrastructure  Inside the station building, which is built on two levels, there are various services such as a ticket office, a bar and a waiting room. Monterosso has three platforms for passenger services. Due to its particular position close to the mountains, the station is located between three tunnels, which is why the foot paths are partly in the tunnel and partly outside. Platforms 1 and 3 are normally used, while platform 2 is used only to allow overtaking or for the terminus of some special services. The freight yard is currently closed. Services  The station, which RFI manages and classified in 2008 in the silver category, has: * Biglietteria a sportello ticket counter * Biglietteria automatica ticket machines * Bar bar * Servizi igienici toilets.

The 54th Soviet Rifle Division was encircled, but was able to hold out until the end of the war.  Prelude  By conquering Northern Finland, the Soviet leadership wanted to occupy the entire Finnish state and cut off the traffic routes to its neighbors during the war. Anthony Upton: Finland 1939‚Äì1940, Newark, 1974 pp. 51 ff., pp. 63 ff. In order to support the advance of the 163rd Rifle Division and 44th Motorized Rifle Division on Oulu, the 54th Rifle Division was to advance south to cut off any routes for reinforcements from the Finnish heartland. William Trotter: A Frozen Hell, Chapel Hill, 1991 pp. 174 ff.  The Battle  After crossing the border, the 54th Division advanced towards Kuhmo. The Finnish army had only small border units stationed in this area, as an attack in northern Finland was not expected. On December 3, 1939, the Finnish High Command under Mannerheim was forced to send a regiment from the reserve, to slow down the advance of the Soviet division. By New Year 1940, the Soviet units had moved within 15 kilometers of the village. There, the division was largely spared of attacks by the outnumbered enemy. The commander of the division, General Nikolai Gusevsky, used this pause to fortify his positions and even had a makeshift airfield built on a frozen lake. The division was in the form of an elongated column along the approach road to Kuhmo. William Trotter: A Frozen Hell, Chapel Hill, 1991 pp. 174 ff. After the 163rd and 44th Soviet divisions had been defeated at the Battle of Suomussalmi further north, Mannerheim sent the units from Suomussalmi towards Kuhmo. The 9th Division under Hjalmar Siilasvuo reached Kuhmo but was outnumbered by the Soviet division and it was now lacking ammunition and artillery. Anyhow, on January 28, 1940, the Finnish troops launched a counterattack. The Finns, who operated on skis from the forest like they did at Suomussalmi, succeeded in cutting off the Soviet division and dividing it into three parts, so-called mottis. The Finns used captured Soviet anti-tank guns in Suomussalmi to repel enemy counter-attacks with tanks. A stalemate loomed. The Soviets tried to relieve the surrounded units with a newly formed 2,000-man ski brigade and the deployment of the 23rd Rifle Division, but these attempts failed. The 54th Division was adequately supplied with supplies by the Soviet Air Force so that it was able to maintain its resistance until the armistice on March 13, 1940. William Trotter: A Frozen Hell, Chapel Hill, 1991 S. 174ff; Anthony Upton: Finland 1939‚Äì1940, Newark, 1974 pp. 66, pp. 88 ff.  Consequences  Finnish casualties were 1,340 dead, 3,123 wounded and 132 missing. The Soviet casualties were 2,118 dead, 3,732 wounded and 573 missing, 720 bodies of Soviet soldiers were found in the area where Colonel Dolin's ski brigade had fought.Bair Irincheev, War of the White Death: Finland Against the Soviet Union 1939-40, Mechanicsburg, PA, Stackpole Books, 2012, . p.118. The assessment of the result of the battle is double : the Finns managed to block the Soviet advance, but their hope of being able to quickly repeat the success of the Battle of Suomussalmi and that of the Raate road, in order to then be able to transfer the 9th division to the crucial sector of the Isthmus of Karelia, was thwarted by the strenuous Soviet resistance.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. Below are the most significant cyclones in the time period.

Erected for the Manchester businessman James Brown as part of a series of flamboyant improvements to the Knockbrex Estate, which he had bought in 1894, it was designed in the Gothic Revival style to resemble a fortified castle with battlemented rooves, arrowslit windows and arched entrances. The buildings were designated a Category A listed building in 1981, by which time they were already in a dilapidated condition. A number of schemes were proposed to rescue and repurpose the buildings between 1990 and 2010, and in 2017 consent was given for it to be converted into holiday accommodation by the Holiday Property Bond. Work was carried out on the site between 2018 and 2020, and it opened to receive its first holidaymakers in 2020. Description Corseyard Farm is a collection of dairy farm buildings about west of Kirkandrews in Kirkcudbrightshire. Designed in a distinctive and flamboyant manner, primarily in the Gothic Revival style and incorporating elements of Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau design, it was converted into holiday accommodation between 2018 and 2020. The principal buildings are laid out around a square courtyard. On the south side of the courtyard is the main block, which was originally a milking parlour. It is buttressed, and accessed by round arched entrances at either end, and its walls are pierced by large cruciform mock-arrowslit windows. On the north side of this is a tall battlemented tower, surmounted by a turret; originally this was built as a water tower, but it did not work properly and was soon disused. The \\"heavy detailing\\" of these buildings is described by architectural historian John Gifford as imparting a \\"nightmarish quality\\". On the east side of the courtyard was a stable block, which incorporates a smaller tower, again battlemented. The north and west sides of the courtyard were the barn and cart shed, which are less elaborately decorated. The southern boundary wall is decorated by the insetting of pebbles taken from the nearby coastline, and is accessed by a gabled gateway with ball finials. In the west corner of the enclosure is a small battlemented tower, which housed a weighbridge and was also used as a tool shed. History In 1894 James Brown, a successful draper from Manchester who had been made rich by the department store he helped establish, Affleck & Brown, purchased and retired to the estate of Knockbrex. He set about a programme of building on the estate, renovating existing structures and constructing new ones, all in a distinctive and unusual style. He often employed the Manchester architect G H Higginbottom, who is thought to have designed Corseyard Farm. Construction started in 1911, it was completed in 1914 and became home to a herd of 12 cows. Its elaborate design, which was most unusual for a utilitarian building, inspired people to refer to it as the Coo Palace (Scots language for Cow Palace), which is still how it is generally known in the local area. In 1981, Corseyard Farm was designated a Category A listed building, but it was already in a state of disrepair and it needed remedial work in 1988 to make it wind and water tight. At the same time, discussions were held between its owners and Historic Scotland (now Historic Environment Scotland) about an application for planning consent to convert the building into holiday accommodation. By 1994, the building had deteriorated further: part of the roof and several doors were missing, and birds were roosting inside. In 1995, it was sold to a developer who planned to restore it for mixed use, as a residence and film studio, for which listing building consent was given in 1998, but the plans for the development were called in for review by Historic Scotland later in 1998 due to concerns about how the designs would change the external appearance of the building. Deterioration of the fabric continued, and by 2010 there were concerns about the buildings' survival. In 2014, Holiday Property Bond purchased Corseyard Farm, and had architectural firm JMP Architects of Lancashire draw up plans to convert the buildings into holiday accommodation. In 2017 Historic Environment Scotland gave the plan their backing, and advised Dumfries and Galloway Council to approve the scheme, which they did in November of that year. By 2018 building work was underway, and in 2020 the site was opened, marketed as The Coo Palace.

R. R. Tolkien built a process of decline and fall in Middle-earth into his legendarium, prominent in both The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings. The pattern is expressed in several ways, including the splintering of the light provided by the Creator, Eru Iluvatar, into progressively smaller parts; the fragmentation of languages and peoples, especially the Elves, who are split into many groups; the successive falls, starting with that of the angelic spirit Melkor, and followed by the destruction of the two Lamps of Middle- earth and then of the Two Trees of Valinor, and the cataclysmic fall of N√∫menor. The whole of The Lord of the Rings shares the sense of impending destruction of Norse mythology, where even the gods will perish. The Dark Lord Sauron may be defeated, but that will entail the fading and departure of the Elves, leaving the world to Men, to industrialise and to pollute, however much Tolkien regretted the fact.  Background  J. R. R. Tolkien was an orphan, his father dying when he was three, his mother, a Roman Catholic, when he was twelve. He was then brought up under the supervision of a Catholic priest, Father Francis Morgan, in industrial Birmingham, which was spreading over the English countryside that he had loved. He remained a devout Catholic all his life, and many Christian themes are visible in his Middle-earth writings. While at Oxford, he joined the informal literary circle of the Inklings, with C. S. Lewis and Owen Barfield among others.  Splintered light  Verlyn Flieger has described the progressive splintering of the first created light, down through successive catastrophes, leaving smaller and smaller splinters as the ages pass. In brief, the creator Eru Iluvatar forms the universe, E√§, with innumerable stars; these light the Earth, Arda, when it is created. The Silmarillion, \\"Ainulindal√´\\" Angelic beings, the Valar, live in the centre of Arda, lit by two enormous lamps, Illuin and Ormal, atop enormous pillars of rock. The \\"Years of the Lamps\\" are abruptly brought to an end when the lamps are destroyed by the fallen Vala Melkor; the powerful fiery light spills out and destroys everything around it. The world is remade with new seas and reshaped continents, no longer symmetrical; the Valar leave Middle-earth for Valinor. The Vala Yavanna, goddess of plants, does her best to recreate the light, in the form of the Two Trees of Valinor, the silver Telperion and the gold Laurelin; they alternately brighten and dim, overlapping to create periods of \\"dawn\\" and \\"dusk\\". The light of the \\"Years of the Trees\\" is gentler than the lamps, lighting only Valinor: Middle-earth lies in darkness. The Silmarillion, ch. 1 \\"Of the Beginning of Days\\" The Two Trees also exude a droplets of light which the Vala Varda (who the Elves call Elbereth) catches in vats; she uses the dew from Telperion to shape bright new silver stars to give at least some light to the Elves of Middle-earth. The Silmarillion, ch. 3 \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\" The splintering continues. In the First Age, Feanor, the most skilled of all Elven-smiths, makes his finest work, the three Silmarils, forged jewels containing some of the light of the Two Trees. The Silmarillion, ch. 9 \\"Of the Flight of the Noldor\\" The making of the Silmarils is timely, as Melkor returns, bringing the insatiable giant spider Ungoliant to devour the Two Trees and absorb all their light into her darkness. These contain the only remaining true light not poisoned by Ungoliant. The Silmarillion, ch. 8 \\"Of the Darkening of Valinor\\" Coat of arms of Gondor bearing the white tree, Nimloth the fair, descendant of Telperion, one of the Two Trees of Valinor that once lit the world Yavanna and Nienna manage to save the last flower of Telperion, which becomes the Moon, and the last fruit of Laurelin, which becomes the Sun. These splinters of light are formed into ships to cross the sky, steered by spirits. The Silmarillion, ch. 11 \\"Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor\\" The Silmarils are fought over in ruinous wars, as narrated in the Quenta Silmarillion. Eventually all are lost: one ends up in the sea, one is buried in the Earth, and one is sent into the sky: by the grace of Elbereth, it is carried by E√§rendil the mariner, forever sailing his ship across the heavens, appearing as the Morning and Evening Star (the planet Venus). The light is still visible, but is now inaccessible to Middle-earth. Quenta Silmarillion Eventually the splinters become as small as the Phial of Galadriel, which she had filled with light gathered from her fountain as it refracted the light of the Star of E√§rendil. The Phial enables Frodo and Sam to defeat the giant spider Shelob, descendant of Ungoliant, on their way to Mordor to destroy the Ring, which contains the power of Sauron, the remaining servant of Melkor on Middle-earth.  Fragmentation of languages and peoples  The Inkling Owen Barfield had a theory of language, described in his 1928 book Poetic Diction, that interested Tolkien, and indeed, as reported by C. S. Lewis, changed his entire outlook. The central idea, connected to Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy, was that there was once a unified set of meanings in an ancient language, and that modern languages are derived from this by fragmentation of meaning. Tolkien took the fragmentation of language to imply the sundering of peoples, in particular the Elves. He took the division into Light and Dark Elves from Norse mythology, but went much further, devising a complex pattern of repeated splitting, migrations, and wars between kindred peoples.  Successive falls  The history of Middle-earth mirrors the biblical fall of man. Fresco by Michelangelo The biblical fall of man begins with a perfect created world; an angel is tempted by pride, and falls, becoming a powerful evil spirit; it in turn tempts humans, who fall; they are cast out of the paradise-garden, which they can never re-enter, and must work for their living in the ordinary world. This pattern is mirrored in Middle-earth. The creator, Eru Iluvatar, sings the first music; one of the angelic spirits, Melkor, becomes proud and falls, singing in disharmony, and ruining everything that is made. This first fall leads to a sequence of catastrophes, including the destruction of the Lamps, then the Two Trees, then the wars over the Silmarils. Tolkien noted that reflections of the biblical fall of man can be seen in the Ainulindal√´, the Kinslaying at Alqualond√´, and the fall of N√∫menor. This pattern represents a profound spiritual pessimism. As a Catholic, Tolkien believed both in the fall of man, and in the redemption of Christians. This redemption might or might not be available, however, to pre-Christian pagans, even if, like Aragorn, they were clearly virtuous. Tolkien shared his pessimistic outlook with Norse mythology, in which he was an expert. Among those myths is Ragnar√∂k, in which the Norse gods, the √Üsir are defeated by the giants, and the world is drowned. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that the heroic Norse response to such a gloomy picture was defiance, a Northern courage, appearing in The Lord of the Rings as a consistent good cheer, a willingness to keep going and to keep smiling, even in the face of apparent disaster.  Fading of an imagined prehistory  Urnes stave church depicts snakes and dragons of Ragnar√∂k, where the Norse gods are defeated and the world is drowned. The Tolkien scholar Marjorie Burns notes in Mythlore that the \\"sense of inevitable disintegration\\" in The Lord of the Rings is borrowed from the Nordic world view which emphasises \\"imminent or threatening destruction\\". She writes that in Norse mythology, this process seemed to have started during the creation: in the realm of fire, Muspell, the j√∂tunn Surt was even then awaiting the end of the world. Burns comments that \\"Here is a mythology where even the gods can die, and it leaves the reader with a vivid sense of life's cycles, with an awareness that everything comes to an end, that, though [the evil] Sauron may go, the elves will fade as well.\\" Patrice Hannon, also in Mythlore, states that: Arda as the Earth in the distant past.The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, #211 to Rhona Beare, 14 October 1958 With the loss of all its peoples except Man, and the reshaping of the continents, all that is left of Middle-earth is a dim memory in folklore, legend, and old words. Shapes of continents are purely schematic. In Hannon's view, Tolkien meant to show that beauty and joy fail and disappear before the passage of time and the onslaught of the powers of evil; victory is possible but only temporary. She gives multiple examples of elegiac moments in the book, such as that Bilbo is never again seen in Hobbiton, that Aragorn \\"came never again as living man\\" to Lothl√≥rien, or that Boromir, carried down the Anduin in his funeral boat, \\"was not seen again in Minas Tirith, standing as he used to stand upon the White Tower in the morning\\". Since he was dead, Hannon writes, this was hardly surprising; the observation is elegiac, not informational. Even the last line of the final appendix, she notes, has this tone: \\"The dominion passed long ago, and [the Elves] dwell now beyond the circles of the world, and do not return.\\" Hannon compares this continual emphasis on the elegiac to Tolkien's praise for the Old English poem Beowulf, on which he was an expert, in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, suggesting that he was seeking to produce something of the same effect: The Lord of the Rings ends with the departure of the last of the Elves from Middle-earth, and the evident dwindling or fading away of all the non-human peoples - the Ents have no Entwives and so are childless; the Dwarves are few; the monstrous Orcs and Trolls that survived the Battle of the Morannon are scattered; the last of the Elves have sailed beyond the Uttermost West to Valinor. The Hobbits are few and might easily be overlooked; the Men of Gondor have a renewal of Elvish blood, one last time, through the marriage of Arwen to their King, Aragorn. All that is left is a world of Men, fading from past glories to the world of today, complete with the industrialisation and pollution of the planet that Tolkien so bitterly resented and regretted, as he described in \\"The Scouring of the Shire\\".

It was written by Georg Alfred Kempf', a Protestant pastor in Alsace, in 1941. With a 1956 melody by Adolf Lohmann, it is part of the common German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob (2013).  History  Georges Alfred Kempf was born on 10 December 1916 in Val d'Ajo, D√©partement des Vosges, Alsace, the son of farmers in the mountains (Bergbauern). As a young farmer, he entered the Hermannsburg Mission Seminary in Lower Saxony, and studied Protestant theology further in Erlangen, T√ºbingen and Strasbourg. He was pastor in several villages in Alsace. From 1946, he published Fraternit√© Evang√©lique, an illustrated monthly paper, and from 1962 to 1978 Le Messager Evang√©lique, a weekly church paper. He was leader of a Jugendspielschar (theatre group of young people) and wrote several plays about Biblical scenes for them. Kempf died in Ingwiller, Alsace, on 24 March 2013. He wrote the poem \\"\\" in 1941. At the time, Alsace had been annexed by Nazi Germany. In his French version, it begins \\"Louez Dieu d‚Äôun chant nouveau, qui peut l‚Äôinterdire?\\" The beginning of the poem is reminiscent of the call to sing a new song to the Lord as in Psalm 98, and the second line already mentions conflict: \\"Niemand solls euch wehren\\" (nobody shall deny it to you). In the first common German Catholic hymnal, the 1975 Gotteslob, the song appeared as GL 268 with Lohmann's melody. In the 2013 edition, it is GL 409. It is also part of other songbooks.  Text  The poem is in four stanzas of seven lines each, rhyming ABABCCB. The first stanza begins with the call to sing a new song to the Lord, as in Psalm 96 and Psalm 98. It then mentions that God never rests (paraphrasing Psalm 121:4), and that he still works miracles today. The second stanza expresses that his mercy is new every day (based on Lamentations 3:23), even on ways through Night (\\"durch Nacht\\"). The third stanza looks back on past support (as mentioned in Deuteronomy 1:31) and calls for confidence (\\"Zuversicht\\"). The fourth stanza concludes on this basis to sing a new songs to him, wherever the sun \\"looks\\" (Allsoweit die Sonne sieht), paraphrasing Psalm 113:3, and let it sound brightly (\\"lasst es hell erklingen\\").  Melodies and musical settings  Adolf Lohmann composed a melody in 1952, and revised it in 1956. It uses changing metre, 4/4, 5/4 and 6/4, indicating a new approach. Paul Horn composed a cantata for three voices and instruments in 1978, published by Carus-Verlag. The music is independent from Lohmann's melody, is in common time and treats the stanzas differently, with a prelude and an interlude. In 2008, Josef Friedrich Doppelbauer composed a four-part setting, again by Carus. After the publication of the second edition of the Gotteslob in 2013, a three-part setting was included in the accompanying Chorbuch Gotteslob by Carus-Verlag.

It is best played by a group where some of those present are unfamiliar with the game. In the traditional version of the game, a player familiar with the rules takes on the role of Aesop, and secretly chooses a letter of the alphabet. Other players assume the role of a predatory animal of their choice. Aesop then asks each player in turn to name an animal that they have eaten recently. The player must name a creature that their role animal is capable of eating. If the named animal contains the letter chosen by Aesop, he denounces them as deserving of punishment and they must perform a forfeit; otherwise they are acquitted as innocent. For example, if Aesop's chosen letter was \\"O\\", then a player acting as a lion may safely say they have eaten a sheep, but will be punished if they have eaten a fox. The game continues \\"for any length of time, or until all have discovered the secret in it\\". Variants In one variant of the game, the players are not animals and Aesop may ask any form of question, simply declaring all responses either \\"Good!\\" or \\"Bad!\\" according to whether they contain the secret taboo letter. Such a game can be played with each player starting the game with three lives, and losing one every time they receive a \\"Bad!\\" judgement.

It was released on the label Importe/12, a subsidiary of popular dance imprint label Sugarscoop. The album originally began development from various electronic experiments Man Parrish experimented with making soundscape electronic records which led to him making connections in his home of New York to record music for a pornographic film. The music in the film was later bootlegged and played in clubs leading him to connect with a studio who wanted him to record an album. Man Parrish was about 22 years old when he made the deal with the label that gave him very little money how much it sold. The record went on to sell about 2 million copies worldwide. Background and production=Background Man Parrish grew up in New York where he developed his musical foundation listening to funk music. At the same time, he was going to high school for the performing arts which would lead him to listening to opera one night and the next listening to groups like Kool & the Gang. Man Parris became interested in electronic music through groups like Tonto's Expanding Head Band and experimental artists like Karlheinz Stockhausen. Man Parris then went to a Radio Shack and purchased a synthesizer kit and began recording music to tape recorders making soundscape types of recordings. At the age of 14, he left home and began spending time at New York's underground scene at clubs like Mudd Club and meeting people like Klaus Nomi. On meeting Nomi, Man Parrish would buy more synthesizers leading to people to visit Man Parrish's home to do demos. Production A friend of Man Parrish's, Joe Gage had connections with someone developing a porn film and needed music for it. This led to Man Parrish recording two tracks for the film including a title track for the film (\\"Heatstroke\\"). Man Parrish would later discover about six months later that \\"Heatstroke\\" has been playing in underground clubs in New York. After finding a club that was performing his song, he approached the DJ who made connections with him to get to a record label in New York who were looking for Man Parrish. On meeting with the record label, Man Parrish was asked to show what other music he had in which he played \\"Man Made\\", \\"Hip Hop Be Bop (Don't Stop)\\" and a few other tracks that would appear on the album. Man Parrish was 22 years old when he signed on to for the album, and later admitted that he \\"didn't know what [he] was doing.\\" Release Man Parrish was released in 1982 on the Importe label, a subsidiary of popular dance imprint Sugarscoop. In the United States, the album charted on Top Black Albums peaking at number 43 on April 2, 1983. The first single released from the album was \\"Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop)\\". The album went on to sell over two million copies worldwide. Man Parrish explained that his music was later sold by his label to Unidisc in Canada for $1,000 where Man Parrish's signature was forged on a piece of paper. Parrish recalls that he often sees compilation on CDs and records with his music on it such as the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and the film Shaun of the Dead. Reception From contemporary reviews, Brian Chin of Billboard compared the album to Kraftwerk's Computer World, stating that Kraftwerk's album will be \\"hard pressed to match the high humor and serious groove\\" of Man Parrish. Chin specifically praised the single \\"Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop)\\" and the \\"Together Again\\" while finding the last two tracks \\"Street Clap\\" and \\"Heatstroke\\" \\"bring Europop and gay disco break together with a bang: interesting juxtaposition to say the least.\\" Ken Tucker praised the single \\"Hip Hop Be Bop (Don't Stop)\\" with the rhythm being as \\"charmingly herky-jerky as that title\\" while finding that \\"the rest of the album is thin, but there are a couple of nice novelty tunes, especially \\"Six Simple Synthesizers\\"\\" J.D. Considine gave the album a four out of five-star rating, declaring that \\"Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop)\\" was \\"a masterpiece of electronic sound sculpting\\" but the rest of the album \\"rarely scales such heights\\" as \\"Mr. Parrish has the insight to sandwich less vital material like \\"mad Made\\" or \\"Together Again\\" between versions of \\"Hip Hop,\\" so that the context makes the weaker songs seem more like respites than mistakes.\\" From retrospective reviews, Sean Cooper of AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, noting that the album \\"hasn't stood up very well\\" with the exception of \\"Hip-Hop Be Bop (Don't Stop)\\" which was \\"almost impossible to hear [...] too many times\\" while \\"Man Made\\" is a lost classic nearly the equal of Parrish's best-known work.\\" Track listing All songs are composed Man Parrish except where noted.

Except for Henking's Sillis (DSE), the compositions were premiered in 1999 during the MDR Musiksommer at the Museum der bildenden K√ºnste in Leipzig and in 2002 at the Hindemith-Musikzentrum in Blonay.Vgl. Programm des MDR Musiksommers 1999.  The music  The following creations were inspired by the Swiss painter Paul Klee and his paintings: * Besessenes M√§dchen Composer Thuring Br√§m concerned himself with Klee's portrait painting. Klee painted both positive and negative faces and he was particularly interested in feminine figures. Demonic Lady (1937) and the subject of this composition, Besessenes M√§dchen (1924), are examples of a sad or somber character in Klee's work. Br√§m became familiar with Besessenes M√§dchen at the Beyeler Foundation in Basel in 2000 and had thought out the entire quartet by 2001. * Shark Turtle RayCf. work commentary by Michael Schneider: Shark Turtle Ray (PDF, 14 kB) for oboe, viola and guitar]. During a stay in Sydney between 1998 and 1999, Michael Schneider was overwhelmed by a creative urge. He composed these three pictorial movements inspired by sharks, turtles, and rays. The piece is scored for oboe, viola and guitar. * Wie der Klee vierbl√§ttrig wurde In 1999, Marianne Schroeder was influenced by Klee's watercolors, Hat Kopf, Hand, Fuss und Herz (1930) and Mr. Z (1934). The movements are played one after another, and the instruments act interchangeably. The title translates to \\"How the clover became four-leaved.\\" It is a pun on Klee's name, which means \\"clover.\\" * N-gl John Wolf Brennan references Klee's Angelus Novus (1920). The short expression N-gl (1999) is a reference to three instruments, without guitar. * Sillis Written in 1992, Sillis is the only work on the album that was not composed for the ensemble. It references one of Klee's most famous paintings, Hauptweg und Nebenwege (1929), created after the artist traveled through Egypt. Christian Henking composed the work for guitar. * Trauernd Trauernd refers to the painting of the same name from 1934, in which Klee reveals his deep distress over experiences after his release from Nazi imprisonment. Alfons Karl Zwicker composed this piece in 2002 for the entire ensemble. * Entweihte Sphinx, Die Sphinx geht Michael Radanovics interpreted the sketches Entweihte Sphinx (1939) and Die Sphinx geht (1939). Klee became mystical as his art matured. Radanovics tried to capture this mood in 1999. * Sozusagen In 17 miniatures, this piece traces the dots and strokes of Klee's Sozusagen (1933), painted after his exile to Switzerland. It is Jean-Luc Darbellay's last composition, written in 1997. It has a motivating and forward-looking effect.  Success  The works on the CD have been performed on several tours in numerous cities in Switzerland. The ensemble has given concerts in Bern, Lucerne, Lausanne and Winterthur. In 2004, the works were broadcast at the Dutch Concertzender.Bijdetijds: Paul Klee. In 2008 there were performances with Alexander Klee, Paul Klee's grandson. In addition, other composers felt inspired to compose on the subject of Klee. The Ensemble Sortisatio was invited to the People's Republic of China and is looking forward to further cooperation with international composers.

They were the basic threat to the rival kingdoms. Fearing Narayani Sena, many Kings didn‚Äôt try fighting against Dwaraka. Because Dwaraka sorted most of the threats through Krishna‚Äôs politics and talent of Yadavas. Using Narayani Sena, the Yadavas extended their empire to most of India. Composition of Narayani Sena Krishna had offered Arjuna, the choice of selection between him or his whole army of Narayani Sena against Duryodhana. He possessed 10 billion fighting Gopes who were brave fighters and were famous by the name of Narayan. In Harivansa Purana, it has been said that Gope or Yadav are generic of the same lineage. The Sena includes Krishna‚Äôs 18,000 brothers and cousins. The Sena had 7 Atirathas (Krishna, Balaram, Samba, Ahuka, Charudeshna, Chakradeva and Satyaki) and 7 Maharathas (Kritavarma, Anadhrishti, Samika, Samitinjaya, Kanka, Sanku, Kunti). Involvement in Kurukshetra war Before the war started in the Kurukshetra battlefield in Mahabharat (one of the two major epics of ancient India), both sides ‚Äì the Kauravas and the Pandavas started out in all directions to meet various kings to solicit support. Incidentally, both Duryodhana (from Kauravas side) and Arjuna (from Pandavas side) reached Dwarika, the kingdom of Shree Krishna together. Lord Krishna put forward a condition in front of both ‚Äì you can have either me on your side or my entire army, the Yadav army ‚Äì known as the Narayani Sena. He also told both that he wouldn't take to any arms during the entire war. So when Krishna first asked Arjun what he wanted, much to Duryodhana's delight, he opted for the Lord- 'Narayan' and Duryodhana got these great warriors of the strong army-'the Narayani Sena. When Narayani Sena was fighting for Kauravas, only Kritavarma and his army unit fought for the Kauravas. Satyaki fought for the Pandavas. The rest of the Atirathas and Maharathas were withheld from the Kurukshetra war on the advice of Balram and Krishna. Post-war attack on Arjuna These Gopas, whom Krishna had offered to Duryodhana to fight in his support when he himself joined Arjuna's side, were no other than the Yadavas themselves, who were also the Abhiras.Ethnic history of Gujarat They were the supporters of the DuryodhanaMan in India, Volume 54-page-39 and Kauravas, and in the Mahabharata,Ancient Nepal Abhir, Gopa, Gopal and Yadavas are all synonyms.

It was sold by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 503‚Äì505 in its catalogues. Plot High in the clouds, Jupiter encounters Mercury and summons up pedestals for all the Muses. He attempts to make the Muses themselves appear using his thunderbolts, but finds the bolts do not work. He sends them off to Hephaestus for repairs, and after some trial and error, manages to summon all nine Muses. The Muses all begin performing their various arts; Jupiter is initially pleased, but the cacophony soon overwhelms him, and he finally sends the Muses back to their pedestals. Mercury and Hephaestus return, making still more noise, and Jupiter banishes the whole company with his thunderbolts. However, this time the power backfires on him, and Jupiter makes a hasty retreat as the thunderbolts spin out of control. Production and themes The film is advertised in M√©li√®s's American catalogue as \\"a mythological burlesque,\\" and it is indeed a highly parodic look at mythology, probably a freewheeling spoof of M√©li√®s's recollections of learning Classics at school. Jupiter is played by M√©li√®s himself as an obese comic role, while Mercury's running in place is a spoofing reference to Mercury's song in the Offenbach opera Orpheus in the Underworld. The film's special effects are created using stage machinery, pyrotechnics, and substitution splices. Classics scholar Pantelis Michelakis, highlighting Jupiter's interactions with the muses, sees the film as an allegory in which Jupiter stands for the filmmaker, \\"the new master of the arts, with the power to conjure up painting, sculpture, song, music and dance, to combine them into an intermedial and interactive spectacle but also to quell their insubordination.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:French black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Georges M√©li√®s Category:French silent short films Category:French films Category:Films based on Greco-Roman mythology Category:Greek and Roman deities in fiction ","title":"Jupiter's Thunderbolts"},{"id":"64792829","text":"Giovanni Maga√±a-Rivera (born April 21, 1998) is an American soccer player who currently plays for FC Tucson in USL League One.

On 1 April 1960 at 6:17:00 UTC, the 1,250 kg plutonium filled fission bomb was detonated with a yield of 3 kt. The explosion created a crater that was later filled in. The Ministry of the Armed Forces subsequently asserted that the test paved the way for the miniaturization of this type of weapon, and that the lower yield was voluntary. A 2001 document of the National Assembly confirmed this assertion while claiming that the bomb was an \\"emergency device\\" that would have been used had Gerboise Bleue failed.  Fallouts  Initial monitoring reported a radiation dose of 100 rad/h at 3 km from ground zero one hour after the blast, and 0.3 rad/h at 45 km. Monitoring at Khartoum, around 3,400 km from Reggane, reported 10-10 Ci/m3. In 2005, the Algerian government asked for a study to assess the radioactivity of former nuclear testing sites. The International Atomic Energy Agency published the report suggesting that Gerboise Blanche explosion site had the highest Caesium-137 surface levels of the four tests, with a residual surface activity between 0.02 and 3.0 MBq/m¬≤ over a surface area of about 1 km¬≤. The same report showed that while the fallouts of the 3 other tests of the Reggane series were contained in circular areas of less than 1 km in diametre, the fallouts of Gerboise blanche expanded south-west over a distance of more than 6 km.

It was further developed by George Tomline during the late nineteenth century. It has been the premises for Orwell Park School since 1936. In contains several Grade II listed buildings. Vernon family period Francis Vernon, his cousin, inherited the estate and he rebuilt the mansion. He also expanded the estate with additional land for an extensive deer park. Thus the estate was known as Orwell Deer Park, or, more simply, Orwell Park. Following his death in 1783, the mansion was bequeathed to his nephew, John Vernon (1776-1818). Upon his death the estate was inherited by his sister, Arethusa, wife of Sir Robert Harland. George Tomline period Water Tower, built in 1868 by John Macvicar Anderson and in use until early 21st century George Tomline bought the estate following the death of Sir Robert Harland in 1848. He made substantial additions to the buildings of the estate, employing John Macvicar Anderson as architect. Water Tower The water tower is a grade II listed building. It was completed in 1873 and is situated 50 metres to the west of the main school building. It is composed of 4 stages and is in total about 20 metres high. The brickwork of the base stage has banded rustication angle-buttresses at the corners, each displaying an urn finial.The second stage sports paired blind windows with semicircular heads. The corners feature less prominent angle-buttresses with fleur-de-lys finials. The third stage has more but smaller paired windows and the buttresses are here clasped.

The play was Feydeau's first success since his first full-length play, Tailleur pour dames, six years earlier.

Duchotel is frequently absent on the pretext of shooting on the country estate of his friend Cassagne. He is, in fact, carrying on an extramarital affair in Paris with Cassagne's wife. Duchotel's wife, L√©ontine, has an admirer, Dr Moricet, but she refuses to give way to him as long as her husband is faithful to her. Duchotel's young nephew Gontran enters, succeeds in extracting 500 francs from his uncle, and leaves. Duchotel departs, with his guns and luggage, and Moricet hints to L√©ontine that there may be an ulterior motive for her husband's regular absences. Cassagne arrives. He is separated from his wife, and has come to Paris to consult Duchotel about obtaining a divorce. He knows that her most ardent adorer is an individual called Zizi, and has taken steps for catching them together in flagrante at the Paris apartment in which they meet. It emerges that Cassagne has not seen Duchotel for six months, and that the latter has never shot over the Cassagne estate. L√©ontine sees that her husband is deceiving her, and on the spur of the moment she tells Moricet that she will be his the same evening. Act 2 The scene is an apartment block at 40 rue d'Ath√®nes. As the venue for his rendezvous with L√©ontine, Moricet has rented furnished rooms previously occupied by a glamorous cocotte, Urbaine des Voitures, who has just been expelled by the concierge, Madame Latour du Nord. The latter is indulgent to extramarital escapades in her rooms, but cannot abide mercenary love. The concierge is unaware that Urbaine has given a key to the apartment to her admirer Gontran. Off the same corridor is another flat, occupied by Madame Cassagne, whose \\"uncle Zizi\\" ‚Äì Duchotel ‚Äì comes to see her once a month. He has already arrived there when Moricet conducts L√©ontine through the opposite door. Their conversation is interrupted by the concierge, who hints that a husband \\"going shooting\\" is really setting a trap for his unfaithful wife. This frightens L√©ontine, and her thoughts of revenge vanish, and the putative lovers quarrel so seriously that they decide to spend the night apart, L√©ontine on a sofa in the next room, while Moricet occupies the bed. The concierge returns: the woman in the opposite room has had an attack of nerves and perhaps Dr Moricet could treat her. He refuses, and Duchotel himself comes to beg him to help, and is astonished to see his friend. L√©ontine appears, and on seeing her husband hides her face with a blanket; Duchotel does not recognise her, and takes himself off without suspecting anything. L√©ontine retires to the other room and Moricet goes to bed again. The door opens gently, and Gontran makes his way to the bed, where he supposes his darling Urbaine is sleeping. He kisses and hugs Moricet, who, after returning this embrace with a box on the ear, jumps out of bed calling for help. Gontran hides in the wardrobe, while Moricet ‚Äì in his drawers ‚Äì and L√©ontine, who has come to his rescue, search for the intruder, but in vain. Then Moricet goes to bed again and L√©ontine returns to her sofa, but they are again disturbed by Duchotel, who, trapped in Mme Cassagne's apartment by the arrival of the police commissary, has escaped from it ‚Äì also in his drawers ‚Äì via the balcony and into Moricet's room. Hastily donning a pair of trousers placed on a chair, he rushes to the door and downstairs, while the pursuing policemen, on discovering Moricet trouserless, arrest and haul him off. Act 3 The action returns to the Duchotel residence, the following morning. Leontine is exasperated with Moricet for failing to keep his trousers, for in one pocket was her letter to him asking him to avenge her. Now her husband is in possession of both trousers and letter. Duchotel arrives from his supposed shooting trip, and when Leontine tells him that Cassagne denies all knowledge of such shooting on his estate, Duchotel insists that Cassagne had sunstroke which badly affects his memory. Cassagne himself enters, confusing matters still further. He is delighted to have caught his wife with her lover and asks Duchotel if he knows this man Moricet. Duchotel says no, at which point Moricet enters. Duchotel tries to pass him off as his shirt-maker. Gontran's arrival throws everyone into confusion, for he has seen them all at 40 rue d'Ath√®nes. They each bribe him to silence. Duchatel finds the love-letter in his trouser pocket but takes it to be an old letter from Leontine written at the time of their engagement, and he asks her to forgive him in memory of that happy time. She refuses, until Gontran quietly suggests she should forgive her husband in memory of the lady he saw at 40 rue d'Ath√®nes the night before. She takes the point and complies, Duchotel promises never to go hunting again, and Moricet gets his trousers back. ::Source: The Era.\\"The Theatre in Paris\\", The Era 30 April 1892, p. 7; and Pronko, pp. 91‚Äì97 Reception In Le Figaro, Henry Fouquier wrote: :Yesterday evening was an evening of laughter and the audience delightedly welcomed a work conceived in joy, nimble and brisk, by an author who enjoys his own imaginings. The play is quite complicated and, for the most part, belongs to the theatre of imbroglio and remains faithful to the tradition of the Palais-Royal, which does not shrink from a little excess in comic situations. But it is clear, of a constant good humour which is irresistible, and the spirit of vaudeville joins a spirit of fine comedy and a very special fantasy. Les Annales du th√©√¢tre et de la musique said: :At last the Palais-Royal has a success, a real success, undisputed and deserved. Yes, deserved, for these three acts by the young author of Tailleur pour dames show great progress since that pleasing start ‚Äì so constant a good mood, such frank and natural cheerfulness of dialogue, such an abundance of good lines, so much fertility, fantasy and ingenuity in the comedy, and such unexpected madness carried the audience away with laughter and caused cheers from the spectators.

He is the editor of the website Linactuelle.fr and participates in Michel Onfray's magazine Front Populaire, launched in 2020. With Onfray, Isabel shares an interest in the anarchist thinker Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, about whom he has written a book, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. L'anarchie sans le d√©sordre (2017, ). Like Benoist, he is a neopagan, influenced by Max Weber's conception of modern polytheism and the non-romantic strain of pagan revivalism represented by Louis M√©nard. He has written a book about pagan philosophy, Manuel de sagesse pa√Øenne (2020, ). There, he writes that thinkers like Aristotle and Confucius did not derive their morals from divine revelations, but from practical wisdom from the attempts to create harmony, and stresses that ancient morality was based on the recognition of limits. He views pagan thought as the viable way for contemporary people to discover the morals that are needed in order for a society to produce something of value, and also ties it in with environmental concerns.

It is now held in a private collection in Zurich, and shares its name with the art movement he would co-found with Franz Marc in the early 1910s. Background Kandinsky was born in Moscow in 1866, the only son of a tea merchant. When his parents divorced, he was sent to live with an aunt; it was his life there when he first discovered the magic of colours. At university, he decided to study Economics and Law, passing his exams \\"with ease\\". Shortly after marrying his cousin, after seeing one in Monet's series of paintings Haystacks, he was faced with a dilemma to be either a professor, or to begin a career as an artist. He decided to learn painting, and thus, in 1896, the thirty-year-old went to Munich, Germany. Description It depicts a horseman in a blue cloak galloping through a meadow on a white horse with a forest in the background. The painting itself is unremarkable, but represented an important milestone on Kandinsky's artistic transition from impressionism to modern abstract art, of which he was one of the pioneers. It was one of his last impressionist works and contains early signs of the abstractionism that would become his forte. The color blue in particular was to have a spiritual significance for the artist, as it did to his German painter friend Marc. The other significance of the work is that it shared its German title (Der Blaue Reiter) with the name of the group of progressive artists co-founded by Kandinsky in 1911, which published an almanac and organised exhibitions of their work.

Its members are Annelies Tanghe (vocals, guitar, keys, percussion) and Sam Pieter Janssens (guitar, bass, percussion, backing vocals, production). Annelies Tanghe and Sam Pieter Janssens have known each other from playing in bands before they started And Then Came Fall in 2017. The band's first self-titled album, And Then Came Fall, was released on Starman Records on February 1st, 2018. The album received critical acclaim. On February 14th 2020, And Then Came Fall premiered a new single, Should We on their YouTube channel. This song would be the first single of a new upcoming album and the start of a live tour in March 2020 in support of Belgian rock band De Mens. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic changed plans. Instead of releasing a new album Annelies Tanghe and Sam Pieter Janssens worked, both in their own homestudio, on a song called Please Don't Disappear. Starman Records released the song on April 7th 2020. It features playlists on Spotify and got national airplay (Radio1, Studio Brussel).  History = And Then Came Fall (2018, full album)  Annelies and Sam had been producing elaborated demos of their songs in the summer of 2016. The songs were re-recorded at La Patrie studio in Ghent, Belgium, during winter of 2016, together with producer Koen Gisen (Flying Horseman, Nordmann, The Bony King Of Nowhere, ...). Steven Van Gelder played drums and Jasper Hautekiet bass on the album tracks. The band's debut album eventually got printed on vinyl after raising funds via crowdfunding. And Then Came Fall signed up with Starman Records for promotion and distribution of the album. Rootstime.be about the record: \\"This could be the debut of the year!\\" Flemish daily newspaper De Standaard: \\"Strong melodies, lots of emotions about love and society and a beautiful mix of styles.\\" Rockportaal.nl: \\"From Broken Circle Breakdown to Alabama Shakes: a beautiful mix of influences.\\" Since its release And Then Came Fall has been touring extensively throughout Belgium and The Netherlands. It's often Annelies Tanghe and Sam Pieter Janssens performing as a two-piece band. But And Then Came Fall performs also as a five-piece band, complemented with keys and backings (Eva Hautekiet), bass (Mathias Moors) and drums (Steven Van Gelder). And Then Came Fall supported many renowned international artists like as Joan As Police Woman, Sarah Blasko, Donavon Frankenreiter and K's Choice.https://www.hln.be/in-de-buurt/dendermonde/twee-keer-k-s-choice-en-nog- veel-meer-in-le-jardin-creole~ad3ac5cb/  Should We (2020, single)  The band decided to release a new single on February 14th, on Valentine's Day. And Then Came Fall celebrated its upcoming tour with Belgian rock band De Mens with new song Should We. It was also the precursor of a forthcoming second album. \\"Once again\\", music blog Luminous Dash writes, \\"this music is of an emotional beauty with the taking lead voice of Annelies Tanghe.\\" But then the COVID-19 pandemic changed everything.  Please Don't Disappear (2020, single)  During lockdown (March 2020) - when And Then Came Fall normally would have been on tour - Annelies Tanghe wrote a topical song about loneliness, isolation, and yet resisting the fear of losing your loved ones during the Covid-19 crisis. Annelies Tanghe and Sam Pieter Janssens recorded their parts separately in their own homestudio. Starman Records released the song on April 24th 2020.

It serves the town of Sestri Levante, Italy. History The first Sestri Levante station was opened on 23 November 1870, coinciding with the opening of the railway line from Chiavari, becoming the temporary terminus of the line from Genoa, which was extended to La Spezia in 1874. The original line a ran on a route via Viale Giuseppe Mazzini (a variant of the Roman Via Aurelia) ‚Äì Piazza Italia ‚Äì Piazza Sant'Antonio ‚Äì Via Vincenzo Fascie (a variant of the modern Via Aurelia which is now a national route), until it rejoined the current alignment. The timber station was therefore located closer to the sea than the current line, in an area adjacent to the current station forecourt. The Chiavari‚ÄìRiva Trigoso section, including the line through Sestri Levante station, was doubled in 1890. To cope with increasing traffic, the current station was opened on 27 August 1924, located further inland on a larger site and equipped with several platforms for departures to Genoa. This station came into operation on 27 July 1925, in conjunction with a rearrangement of the station area. The previous temporary station building was replaced with the current, monumental building. The old tracks were dismantled together with the old passenger building which was demolished. At the same time, the station was electrified at the three-phase voltage of 3600 V at 16 2/3 Hz, which was activated in 1926. The conversion to 3000 V DC took place in April 1947 towards La Spezia (the station temporarily became the location for a traction change) and on 25 April 1948 the new system was extended towards Genoa.  Buildings and infrastructure  The station has 5 passing tracks and 2 (3 until 2007) platform tracks for passenger services, plus other passing tracks used for the storage of railway wagons and train sets not in service. In the past there were also two other main line tracks without a platform that connected to the freight yard, but these were removed in 2007 together with a third main line track for passenger trains so that a car park and a building complex could be built. Trains that do not have terminate at this station stop at platforms 2 and 3 (2 towards Genoa, 3 towards La Spezia), while the other tracks are used for trains starting or stopping in Sestri.  Rail services Platforms The station is served by Trenitalia regional services operated under a contract with the region of Liguria. In particular, the station is used both as a terminus and a stop for regional services on the line to Genoa and Savona and on the line to the Cinque Terre and the La Spezia area. Trenitalia long- distance services and regional services that connect the town to Milan, which are operated with Trenord rolling stock, also stop at Sestri Levante. In the past, the station was the terminus of international services towards Switzerland and Germany, such as the Eurocity services, Carlo Magno and Barbarossa. Services  The station is managed by RFI, which classified it in 2008 in the silver category. The seven tracks all adjoin platforms and are connected to each other by an underpass. It has: * Biglietteria a sportello ticket counter * Biglietteria automatica ticket machines * Polizia Ferroviaria station of the railway police * Servizi igienici toilets * Negozi Newsstand * Sala d'attesa waiting room. Interchange The station has a commuter car park.

History The Colony of New France was officially settled during the reign of Henry IV in 1608 when Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec, and in the following years it came under the control of several fur trading companies, eventually consolidating control under the newly founded Company of One Hundred Associates in 1627, which was made up of investors back in France, who would be charged with supplying ships and provisions to transport a certain number of colonists to settle in the territory every year, as well as covering all administrative costs for the colony, and in return were granted a monopoly on virtually the entire fur trade in Canada. For a number of different reasons the quota of new settlers coming from France was continually not being met, and the population of New France fell far behind that of the rival English colonies in North America, as well as the early Dutch colony of New Netherland. The small group of businessmen and nobles in the young colony led by Pierre Legardeur and Jean-Paul Godefroy, came up with the idea to take over the mandate of overseeing the settlement of Canada from the Company of One Hundred Associates, whose investors were far removed across the ocean back in France, and in return profit on the monopoly of the fur trade themselves in the colony. They managed to convince the Crown of their plan and were granted a charter to that effect in 1645. Initially the company was overseen and owned by a small number of notable merchants, businessmen, and nobles in the colony, who would cover the costs of shipping 20 colonists to Canada a year, as well as all administrative expenses of the colony, and an additional 1,000 livres worth of beaver pelts in rent on top of all expenses. Not long after this, following the protests of several rival and disgruntled Canadian lords and businessmen back in France, the royal authorities in Paris became weary of such large revenues from the North American fur trade being managed and profited on in a far away, sparsely settled territory by such a small group of individuals, and citing \\"extravagances\\" by the twelve original owners and directors, took back control of the company just two years later in 1647, and replaced the board of directors with a regulatory council, made up of the Governor and several other officials to act solely as an arbitrary body for oversight, with the company shares and the entire fur trade with it soon after being opened up to the general public. Matters worsened when the fur trade and subsequently the company went into sharp decline following the French-allied Hurons being pushed further west in a war with their Iroquois enemies in 1652. Consumed by debt, the company shares were consolidated and slowly but steadily sold off in the following years to the Company of Rouen in France, with the control of the fur trade and responsibility of colonization shifting back to the Company of One Hundred Associates, and both companies would finally be dissolved in 1663 by King Louis XIV, who then transferred the rights of investment in the fur trade to the French West India Company, and took the colony under direct control of the Crown and made it a province of France, substantially increasing the settlement and development of Canada in the following years. Personnel The company was founded and initially managed (and virtually entirely owned) by a board of twelve directors that included: *Jean Bourdon- Royal Surveyor and engineer *Fran√ßois de Chavigny- seigneur and lieutenant to Governor de Montmagny *Guillaume Couillard- seigneur and businessman *Mathurin Gagnon- merchant and store owner *Robert Giffard- seigneur and master-surgeon *Jean-Paul Godefroy- Native American interpreter and businessman *Jean Godefroy de Lintot- seigneur and fur merchant *Jean Guyon- seigneur and master mason *No√´l Juchereau des Chastelets- businessman and legal councillor *Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny- noble, seigneur, and admiral of shipping for New France *Jacques Leneuf de la Poterie- noble, seigneur, businessman, and Governor of Trois-Rivi√®res *Michel Leneuf du H√©risson- noble, seigneur, businessman, and later Lieutenant-General of Trois- Rivi√®res Two years after its formation a regulatory council replaced the owners and directors, which was composed of the Governor of New France, the Governor of Montr√©al, the Superior of the Jesuits in Canada, and they were assisted by the syndics, or locally elected legal representatives, of the three major towns of Qu√©bec, Trois-Rivi√®res, and Montr√©al.

Agcaoili ( - ), also known as Ka Fidel, was a Filipino activist and revolutionary. He was a member of the Communist Party of the Philippines' Central Committee, along with Jose Maria Sison and Luis Jalandoni during the Marcos dictatorship. In 1974, he was arrested and became the longest detained political prisoner under Marcos, being imprisoned for 11 years. On his release, Agcaoili founded the Samahan ng mga Ex-Detainee Laban sa Detensyon at Aresto (SELDA), a prisoners' rights organization. From 1989 until his death, Agcaoili was involved in peace negotiations between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines. Most notably, he was instrumental in signing the Comprehensive Agreement on the Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) in 1998. Agcaoili continued to serve in the peace panel, becoming co-chair of the GRP-NDFP Joint Monitoring Committee in 2004, and eventually succeeding Jalandoni as chief negotiator in 2017. Early life and activism Agcaoili was born to an \\"upper class family\\" and \\"could have easily attained an endless series of high positions in the ruling system. His father had an insurance company and was an established lawyer, and was a classmate and friend of Ferdinand Marcos in the UP College of Law. His family lived in Philamlife Homes. Agcaoili first became a student at the University of the Philippines Diliman in the early 1960s, taking up Political Science. As a freshman, he was first exposed to activism when he became a member of the Student Cultural Association of the University of the Philippines (SCAUP). As a member of SCAUP, he encouraged his friends and neighbors in Philamlife Homes to join in mass actions organized by SCAUP. He also joined a fraternity in UP, encouraging his fraternity brods to be politically active. Norberto Basilio, who would eventually become the Philippine ambassador to Greece and Bangladesh introduced Agcaoili to Jose Maria Sison and Julie de Lima. Agcaoili joined a Marxist study organized by Sison, which took place in the private residence of ambassador Emilio Bejasa. His son, Emilio, Jr. was also a member of SCAUP, and his father had a collection of Marxist works. Basilio, Bejasa, Jr., and Agcaoili would continue to maintain close contact during the Martial Law years as members of the Communist Party of the Philippines. In 1963, his father sent him to study in California, fearing that he was \\"straying too far into revolutionary activism.\\" While in the United States, he became a part of the protests against the Vietnam War. He returned a year later, in time to participate in the founding of Kabataang Makabayan in 1964. It was also during this time when he met, eloped, and married his wife, Rosario. At some point, Agcaoili became a high-ranking officer in his father's insurance company. He also became a member of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 during this time, which was undergoing a split between the old Lava faction and the younger faction led by Sison. He organized studies, produced publications, and entered negotiations with other local and foreign parties, and eventually contributed to the reorganization brought about by the First Great Rectification Movement. Marcos dictatorship and Martial Law In 1970, Agcaoili became part of the Central Committee of the CPP. He also became the chair of the CPP's Finance Committee. Agcaoili was involved in \\"discreet\\" action as part of the CPP. Although he did not take an active part, he was present in the Battle of Mediola on January 30, 1970. Agcaoili and Satur Ocampo were also involved in aiding Victor Corpus' defection to the New People's Army, assisting in the 1970 raid of the Philippine Military Academy raid in Baguio. Agcaoili, Rosario, and their two children went underground before the imposition of Martial Law in September 1972. State forces interrogated his family in a bid to know their whereabouts. While underground, Agcaoili became instrumental in founding the National Democratic Front of the Philippines on April 23, 1973. He was also reportedly involved in the purchase of the M/V Karagatan, which was used by the New People's Army in an attempt to land arms in Palanan, Isabela, and the M/V Do√±a Andrea II in a similar attempt in 1974. Arrest and detention Agcaoili and his family were eventually arrested on May 12, 1974, in Balicon Subdivision, Calasiao, Pangasinan. A military tribunal charged with rebellion related to the M/V Karagatan incident. Agcaoili was incarcerated in various detention centers while contesting the charges, such as Camp Crame, Bilibid, and lastly in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig. Agcaoili, like other political prisoners, was subject to torture, solitary confinement, and other methods of abuse. State agents gave him morphine injections to induce addiction, the idea being that the withdrawal would be so severe as to force him to give up information. The military considered him to be one of the \\"hard-cores\\" alongside other prominent figures in the revolutionary movement such as Sison and Bernabe Buscayno. While in prison, Agcaoili continued to push for better living conditions, visiting hours, and so on. In 1976, Agcaoili and more than 140 other political prisoners staged a 14-day hunger strike to demand the release of two nursing mothers and their babies. They were subject to brutal retaliation from soldiers, and the strike's leaders, including Agcaoili, were forcibly taken by soldiers from their cells. A \\"literal tug-of-war\\" occurred between soldiers and the other detainees over Agcaoili, but he eventually willingly went with the soldiers to prevent injuries on the detainees. During the visit of Pope John Paul II to the Philippines in 1981, Agcaoili and other political prisoners were transferred to Bilibid prison in Muntinlupa, where they were threatened by armed gangs inside the prison. Agcaoili reportedly called all the gang leaders in a meeting and said, \\"We know you are all armed. But we political prisoners, we have an army outside prison, the New People's Army. If you harm any of us, you will be held accountable by the NPA.\\" The threats ended and the gangs eventually joined the political prisoners in protest actions. The lifting of Martial Law in 1981 resulted in the release of multiple political prisoners. Agcaoili, however, was not scheduled for release due to his status. He first applied for bail in 1982, but no action was taken by the court. He filed a petition for mandamus on April 14, 1984, to compel the government to release him on bail. He was eventually released on October 24, 1984, more than ten years after his initial arrest. Post-detention On his release, Agcaoili returned to activism. He formed the Samahan ng mga Ex- Detainee Laban sa Detensyon at Aresto (SELDA), a prisoners' rights group. He also helped organize Families of Victims of Involuntary Disappearance (FIND) in 1985, becoming its Executive Director. The overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship gave renewed energy to both the leftist progressive movement and the revolutionary movement. Agcaoili, Sison, and others, began laying the groundwork for peace negotiations on the request of the new Corazon Aquino administration, through Executive Secretary Joker Arroyo, but peace negotiations stalled and eventually broke down. Agcaoili was also involved in the Preparatory Committee which established the Partido ng Bayan (PnB, precursor to Bagong Alyansang Makabayan) on August 30, 1986. Agcaoili took over as Chairman when labor leader Rolando Olalia and his driver Leonor Alay- ay were kidnapped and murdered by elements of the Armed Forces of the Philippines as part of the \\"God Save the Queen\\" plot, in time for the 1987 senatorial elections. In 1988, Agcaoili was targeted for arrest and decides to go on voluntary exile in Europe, taking a job with the Spanish non-government organization Instituto de Estudios Pol√≠ticos para Am√©rica Latina y Africa (IEPALA). Alongside other former political prisoners under Marcos, SELDA filed a landmark class-action lawsuit against the Marcos estate for reparations on account of the grave human rights abuses they suffered during the time of Martial Law. Agcaoili and Ocampo collated the names and experiences of some 10,000 victims of human rights abuses during the Marcos dictatorship and brought the case to court in Hawaii. Agcaoili was also a representative of the International Network of Philippine Studies, and became instrumental in organizing the International League of People's Struggle with Sison. Agcaoili also continued his key role in representing the NDFP in negotiations with other parties, organizations, and movements, as well as organizing migrant Filipino workers. Peace talks Agcaoili joined exploratory talks between the GRP and the NDFP in 1989 when President Aquino sent Jose Yap to the Netherlands to negotiate. Talks continued on and off at the tail-end of the Aquino administration and into the Fidel V. Ramos administration. On September 1, 1992, when both sides adopted the Hague Joint Declaration as the framework of the GRP-NDFP peace negotiations, Agcaoili assumed the role of Vice Chairperson of the NDFP Negotiating Panel. Agcaoili also headed the NDFP Reciprocal Working Committee for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law, which drafted the Comprehensive Agreement on the Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law, adding specific provisions for the respect of rights for political prisoners. CARHRIHL was formally signed on March 16, 1998 In 2004, Agcaoili served as the co-chair of the GRP-NDFP Joint Monitoring Committee which looked into CARHRIHL violations. He continued in this position until his death. In 2016, he replaced Luis Jalandoni as chairperson of the NDFP Negotiating Panel, in time for the resumption of peace talks under Rodrigo Duterte. Agcaoili engaged in a series of talks with Duterte which paved the way for the resumption of peace talks in August 2016. Death On July 23, 2020, the National Democratic Front of the Philippines announced that Agcaoili died, 12:45 pm, in Utrecht, Netherlands. The cause of death was a pulmonary arterial rupture which caused massive bleeding. Agcaoili was cremated on July 30 in Crematorium Daelwijck in Utrecht, and was sent to the Philippines for burial. A tribute was also streamed live over the internet on August 8, 2020, on what was to be Agcaoili's 76th birthday. Agcaoili was survived by his wife Rosario, five children, and multiple grand-children. Legacy The Communist Party of the Philippines called Agcaoili \\"one of the most beloved and respected leaders of the Party, the NDFP, and the Filipino people.\\" It also declared August 8 as a \\"National Day of Remembrance and Tribute\\" to Agcaoili. Jorge \\"Ka Oris\\" Madlos, spokesperson for the New People's Army, stated that Agcaoili's \\"life, his militance, commitment and determination to advance the revolutionary struggle for national freedom and social liberation will forever serve as inspiration for all Red fighters of the NPA and for the Filipino people.\\" SELDA released a joint statement alongside other human rights organizations, praising Agcaoili as a \\"staunch champion and defender of human rights.\\" They described him as\\"blunt, yet funny; serious and gentle, and always imparting lessons from his life in the revolutionary struggle.\\" Contemporaries remembered Agcaoili as taking on the smallest details, such as making travel arrangements and picking up consultants at the airports, despite his high-ranking position. His counterparts in the GRP Negotiating Panel regarded him as \\"kind, flexible on the negotiating panel, yet strict and firm on principles.\\" Former Quezon City mayor Herbert Bautista, who was also a part of the GRP Panel, called Agcaoili \\"funny, but firm and serious on the negotiating table.\\" Idun Tvedt, the Royal Norwegian Special Envoy to the Philippine Peace Process, said Agcaoili was \\"a professional and dedicated negotiator in the search for a peace solution to the armed conflict in the Philippines.\\" Her predecessor, Elisabeth Slattum, called him a negotiator \\"with great dedication and heart for the cause.\\" The Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist) published a short statement in its publication, calling Agcaoili's death a \\"great loss to the CPP, the NDFP and the entire Filipino people.\\" The Workers World Party also sent its \\"deepest condolences and firm solidarity\\", saying his \\" lifelong dedication to organizing working and oppressed people must be held high as an example and inspiration for revolutionaries around the world and in particular the youth.\\" Journalists remembered him as \\"always eager to clarify issues.\\" Danny Buenafe called him the \\"toughest\\" between him, Sison, and Jalandoni. After his passing, Julieta de Lima-Sison was appointed interim chairperson of the NDFP Negotiating Panel, being the \\"most senior and most available\\" member of the peace panel.

Soon after earning a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1918, Makaroff established a law practice in Saskatoon. He defended the spiritual leader of the Doukhobors from deportation to the Soviet Union in 1933, and defended the unemployed men arrested in connection with the Regina Riot of 1935. Makaroff became close friends with J.S. Woodsworth, founder of the socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), and ran as a CCF candidate in the 1934 Saskatchewan general election and the 1940 Canadian federal election. A long-time member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, he endowed the World Federalist Prize \\"for the best annual essay relating to world peace through world law\\".

Life and works Anna Katharina Hahn was born in Ruit (Ostfildern), a small town short distance to the south-east of Stuttgart. She attended secondary school in nearby Stuttgart. Hahn won her first literary prize while still at school, coming first in a short story competition organised by the city authorities in 1988. On leaving school she enrolled at the Hamburg University where in 1995 she gained a \\"Magister degree\\" in Germanistics, Anglistics European Ethnology and Folklore. From 1996 to 2001 she worked as a research assistant in the German Bible Archive and in the manuscripts department of the Hamburg State and University Library. Her first texts were academic in nature and dealt with the history of bibles in the late medieval period: at around the same time her literary texts began to appear in journals and anthologies. There were also two volumes of short stories: \\"Sommerloch\\" published in 2000 and \\"Kavaliersdelikt\\" in 2004. In 2004 she took part in the Ingeborg Bachmann literary competition with her book \\"Kavaliersdelikt\\", which was listed for inclusion by Ursula M√§rz (as one of the jurors): on this occasion Hahn's book was not among the prize winners, however. Her first full-length novel K√ºrzere Tage (Shorter Days) was published in 2009, and ranked ninth that year on a \\"SWR-Bestenliste\\". Her 2012 novel, \\"Am Schwarzen Berg\\" (At the Black Mountain), deals playfully with motifs from Eduard M√∂rike, and was well received. Her novel \\"Das Kleid meiner Mutter\\" (My mother's dress), which appeared in 2016, deals with the impact of economic crisis in Spain. It received a more mixed response from at least some of the more mainstream German critics. Anna Katharina Hahn is a member of PEN Centre Germany.

Built in 1838, the building was at one point the summer house of Georgia Governor Herschel Vespasian Johnson. The building was damaged by a fire in 1969 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  History  Located in what was at the time the capital city of Georgia, the building was built in 1838 for Colonel Samuel Rockwell of the Georgia Militia. Rockwell, a slaveholder, had previously lived in Maine before moving to Georgia in 1834, and before moving to Milledgeville to practice law, he served as an attorney in Savannah. The architect behind the building's construction was Joseph Lane, who had traveled with Rockwell from Maine to design the building. Rockwell would later serve on the committee that built what is now Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, while Lane would go on to design several buildings on the campus of Oglethorpe University. The building was constructed at a cost of approximately $2,500, while the cast iron fence surrounding the property reportedly cost about $2,600. An urban legend claims Rockwell suffered a heart attack after hearing how much the fence had cost. Rockwell died at the property in 1841. Following this, the house passed through several owners, and at one time served as the summer house for Herschel Vespasian Johnson, who would later become Governor of Georgia. Following Johnson's death in 1880, the house again passed through several owners. The building was sold again in 1967 to an owner who began renovating the historic building, but in 1969 the building was damaged by a fire caused by a blowtorch used in the renovation process. Following this, many of the original features of the house have been removed, and the house has been the subject of a renovation project since 1971. On April 19, 1978, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2019, the building was sold to an Atlanta-based realtor who specializes in historic preservation.  Architecture  The building is an example of Federal architecture, with the columns and pediment showing elements of Greek Revival architecture. The building consists of eight rooms spread over two floors, as well as two foyers on each floor, with a spiral staircase connecting the floors.

Federal had several subsidiaries, Dixie Portland Flour Mills (flour) and Cosby-Hodges Milling Company (animal feed). In 1972, Federal purchased Great Western Foods (GWF) of Knoxville, Tennessee from Great Western United Corporation. A Justice Department antitrust lawsuit was filed by assistant district attorney Thomas E. Kauper, to require the divestment of GWF. The lawsuit stated Federal had 11 percent of the regional flour milling capacity, had 15% of the hard wheat bakery flour market, and 5% of the home market (bakery was approximately 75% of Federal's flour business). GWF had 6% of the capacity, 3% of the bakery market (primarily soft wheat bakery flour), and 9% of the home market. Federal attempted to launch the \\"Gingham Girl\\" brand of premium flour in 1964, but it never achieved much market share despite marketing effort. By the 1970s, Federal was producing about 50 private-label and non-premium brands, but their sales had been in a steep decline from 1965 to 1974. Federal Company and its subsidiary Dixie Portland Flour Mills purchased GWF in 1972. As Federal had 11% of the flour market, a Justice Department assistant district attorney in the antitrust division, Thomas E. Kauper, filed suit to require the divestment of GWF.

The ship was bought by the Royal Danish Navy in 1824 and became its first steamship. It was bought as a personal transport for the Royal Family of Denmark and got the name Kiel. Rebuilt as a two-masted schooner in 1853 and eventually broken up in 1897.  Under British colours  Thomas Brocklebank was in the timber business and also had a shipyard in Deptford on the Thames. In 1821 his yard delivered the paddle steamer Eagle, which became the first steamer on the service between London and Margate. Margate was a popular seaside venue on the eastern tip of Kent, known for its fine sand beaches. Brocklebank was also in charge of the shipping company that owned the Eagle, called the Eagle & Falcon Steam Packet Co.. There is no record of a Falcon, but in 1822 the Royal Sovereign was completed and taken over, also built at Brocklebank's yard. Thomas Brocklebank got in contact with William John Hall, who had ships going between Hull and London, and they were in charge of the formation of the General Steam Navigation Company, officially instituted at a meeting in June 1824. Just prior to that - in May - the Eagle had been sold to the Kingdom of Denmark, so the new shipping company opened sevice with the Royal Sovereign and the brand new City of London, also built by Brocklebank, in 1824. port engine of the Eagle/Kiel, measured and drawn in 1829. The Eagle had two steam engines from Boulton and Watt. They delivered a total of 40 nominal horsepower, giving the vessel a speed of 6-7 knots. In Danish service the crew numbered 11, with four of these working the machinery. The boilers were replaced in 1828 and 1842, which was normal practise in those days. The stated width refers to the normal hull, but including the wheel covers the vessel was almost 10 meters wide, giving it a beam to length ratio of approximately 1:3. The Kiel was measured and drawn by Orlogsv√¶rftet in 1829. Her high beam to length ratio clearly stands out.  Under Danish colours  When steamships started to appear, the admiralties of the different navies started to consider their military value. The general conception was that the big wheels on the sides made the vessels too vulnerable for service in naval battles, but their effectiveness as tugs and transports was recognized. In Denmark there was opposition against any procurement, because the funds would have to be diverted from the general naval budget, which was under great stress, as the Royal Danish Navy was still in the process of rebuilding the fleet after the disastrous events of the Napoleonic wars. There was, however, a need for a Royal yacht for king Frederick VI, and as the king wanted a steamship, there would be an opportunity to use it and gain some experience with steam power. It is telling, that Schultz underlines that is was the king who pushed for the purchase of paddle wheelers. The Danish naval lieutenant Hans Christian Bodenhoff was on a tour of duty in England, and - following the royal approval of the project, March 19, 1824 - he was commanded to find an appropriate vessel. In May 1824 he bought the Eagle for ¬£ 4,500 and the ship got new aft cabins modelled on George III's yacht Royal Sovereign. The new Royal yacht was renamed as the Kiel and with Bodenhoff in command it arrived in Copenhagen on June 4, 1824. Frederik Kloss. Frederick VI used the ship extensively for his many travels around the kingdom of Denmark, right up to his death in 1839. In that year, the Danish admiralty had proposed the procurement of a new steamship. When the new king, Christian VIII, was informed of this, he initially put the proposal on hold, but in March 1840 the King approved the purchase of two steamships, the smallest of which would serve as the new Royal yacht. It was named √Ügir and arrived in Denmark in October 1841. In November the Kiel was lent to the shipping service on the Great Belt, as the mail steamer Mercurius was up for maintenance. When the vessel was returned in March 1842 she was inspected and found to be in bad shape. So bad, actually, that the master of the Royal dockyard (Orlogsv√¶rftet) recommended that the Kiel should be broken up. But the admiralty wanted to keep her in reserve, so the hull was repaired and new boilers were built in Frederiksv√¶rk. Demand for the retiree appeared almost immediately. King Christian VIII spent his summer vacations in Wyk on the island F√∂hr, and he had had the unpleasant experience of seeing his coach sent into the waves by the boom of the regular sailing ship serving the island. So in the years 1843-1846 he saw to it that the Kiel was made available for his transportation, and as the ship was there, it could also deliver guests to the popular bathing establishment on the island - in return for payment to the Danish Navy, of course. In 1847 the Danish Navy's new paddle wheeler Hebe took over. During its service in the Wadden Sea, the Kiel took time off for a detour to √òresund in June 1844, when the Prindsesse Wilhelmine surrendered her machinery to the new Hertha. This meant that there was no tug service in the Sound, and so for a time the Kiel took over, until the King went on vacation. During the winters, the Kiel was based in Altona, and this continued when the Hebe arrived. As her transport services were no longer needed, the Kiel was instead lent to the Harbour Commission of the town Gl√ºckstadt.  Under German colours  When the First Schleswig War broke out in March 1848, the Kiel was still in Gl√ºckstadt, in what was now rebel/enemy waters. The insurgents of Schleswig-Holstein had no navy, but were intent on acquiring one. Officially, this would be done by creating a Scleswig-Holstein naval force under the auspices of the newly created German Reichsflotte. The Kiel was incorporated in this force and became a part of the Westsee Division. She was used as a troop tranport and also served as a tug for the rowed gunboats of the new navy. The efforts of the Division were effective enough to force the Danish troops in the area to retreat to the island of Fan√∏. In German service the Kiel was equipped with four 18-pounder guns. At the end of the war, Kiel was returned to DenmarkFor some reason, neither Degenkolv in 1889 nor Schultz in 1930 saw any cause to inform their readers of the fact that the Royal yacht actually spent time in German service. In both books, she was loaned out to the Harbour Commission in Gl√ºckstadt, and then returned ... Orlogsv√¶rftet in Copenhagen made this proposal for the rigging of Kiel as a transport schooner in 1852.  Back under Danish colours  At the end of the First Schleswig War, and following negotiations, the Kiel was returned to the Royal Danish Navy in August 1851. There was really no use for her, and she was put up for sale at two auctions in 1851 and 1852. A plan B was then carried out, with the machinery being removed and the vessel rebuilt as a transport schooner. The Navy sold the Kiel in April 1865 to the merchant J. P. Larsen of L√∏kken. He changed the name to Frederik 6's Minde. After Larsen's death, his widow married the land owner Lars Christian Nielsen, and he was the majority owner of the vessel from 1885. In 1892 - after his death - it became part of the estate of Nielsen. The old oak planks must have been well put together, for the ship soldiered on and could be found in the ship registry until February 1897, when it was finally reported as broken up.

By 1910 a factory of the Kasai Company had been established near Misumba, which had about two thousand inhabitants. The company had made successful trial rubber plantations. The company also bought rubber and ivory from the local people, some of whom used it to buy liquor from the Portuguese territory (Angola).

The fire blaze killed 11 people and wounded a further 22. The hotel was used as a temporary COVID-19 facility as it was leased out by the private hospital Ramesh Hospitals Vijayawada for the purpose of treating infected COVID-19 patients. An electrical short circuit was described as the ultimate reason for the incident. The fire had been brought under control by the firefighters within a space of 30 minutes. The patients who survived from the fire blaze were transferred to another quarantine centre.  Background  India has recorded numerous cases related to fire accidents in the history mainly due to lack of safety facilities and inadequate fire extinguishers. The Visakhapatnam gas leak, the Delhi factory fire, and the Delhi hotel fire were the country's worst fire accidents in the recent times. India is currently the second worst affected country in the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the fire incident has posed further burden and humiliation to the healthcare sector impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in India.  Incident  The fire blaze erupted at the Vijayawada coronavirus hotel facility killing around 11 COVID-19 patients, injuring 22 others. The fire broke out initially in the first floor and second floor before spreading quickly to third and fifth floors. It was reported that two patients who were panickingly rushed, screamed for help and jumped from the hotel terrace to escape from the blaze. Nine patients died due to suffocation caused by fire blaze and one reportedly died succumbing to burn injuries. There were a total of about 30 patients being treated for COVID-19 along with ten hospital staff prior to the incident.

Early life and education  Laurie Frick began her career in technology, most notably heading up the emerging markets group in consumer products at Compaq in 1996, before switching her focus to visual arts. After spending twenty years in the technology sector, Frick switched career paths. In 2007, Frick presented her MFA thesis exhibition at the New York Studio School and received her degree.  Career  According to NPR's Laurie Sydell, Frick's use of sleep tracking devices inspired her to consider data as a possible medium. She used watercolor drawings to help her see patterns in the data. This began a decade- long exploration where Frick has used data about wellness, exercise, and personality and turned it into colorful artworks using watercolors, leather, and glass.  Style  Laurie Frick creates geometric styled sculptures, paintings and installations. The work frequently employs grids as an underlying organizational structure and according to Wired Magazine, achieves through paint, \\"a warmth not possible to achieve with technology alone.\\" NPR's Laurie Sydell describes the work as looking \\"a bit like a spreadsheet composed by Mondrian.\\" Barbara Purcell similarly mentioned the artist Piet Mondrian as an antecedent in Sight Lines  Themes  Self tracking data becomes medium in the hands of Frick. The artist has said she wants to \\"understand how it feels to see yourself through your own data\\", and that her paintings are \\"data portraits\\" that give form to the invisible rhythms of our lives. In May 2020, she cited as a touchstone, Ben Lipkowitz, a member of the Quantified Self community, who life-logged all of his daily time, tracking his every movement. ‚ÄúHe believes if you collect enough data about yourself, you can create a future version of yourself. An avatar that goes beyond you.‚Äù Frick told the Atlantic that data art allows the viewer to understand who she is more clearly and to discover things around herself she may have forgotten or even never known. An example of these discoveries appeared in the Huffington Post, when Sarah DiGiulio interviewed Frick about the art she made using sleep tracking software. According to Frick, her husband's sleep score was twice as a high as hers, a finding she did not expect. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt remember his good sleep. He just remembered his bad sleep and when he had trouble sleeping. It was so him,‚Äù Frick told the Huffington Post. ‚ÄúThat was what struck me. Measuring sleep is like measuring your personality. Sleep is like a signature. It‚Äôs a fingerprint. It‚Äôs very identifiable.‚Äù  Reception  Frick's art work has been featured in mass media publications including NPR‚Äôs All Things Considered, The Atlantic, and The Los Angeles Times along with online industry magazines such as Artnet and Hyperallergic. In 2011, Leah Ollman of the Los Angeles Times praised Frick's exhibition at Edward Cella Art + Architecture, calling it \\"an invigorating immersion in pattern, rhythm, repetition and variation.\\" She went on to observe, \\"again and again in the work, the scientific impulse toward rigor and regularity is tempered by a whimsical urge toward improvisation.\\" In a 2015 feature for The Atlantic by Jacoba Urist Frick is featured prominently along with established figures such as Danish artist Jeppe Hein and US based artist Hans Haacke. The article identifies a group of artists who believe that self tracking offers insight into the human condition, while simultaneously asking whether the art can achieve these goals. Ultimately, the author leaves the question unanswered.

Biography  His primary studies were carried out at the Jos√© Mar√≠a Heredia School located in his native town, and then graduated from high school. He moved to Havana where he studied at the University of Havana for Medicine. Upon graduation he worked as a surgeon at the Emergency Hospital of Havana. He, then, returned to his hometown and worked at the Civil Hospital there. He worked under the commander - Doctor Ren√© Vallejo at the La Caridad clinic where they healed the wounded of the Rebel Army and of the clandestine fighters.  Revolutionary path  Piti Fajardo had the professional responsibility of assisting the wounded Rebel Army sent from the Sierra. On March 24, 1958, he followed Dr. Vallejo and joined the Sierra. There he changed his duty as a doctor to military and became a soldier. He then participated in the battles of \\"Santo Domingo\\",\\"Providencia\\", \\"Cuatro Caminos\\", \\"Las Mercedes\\", \\"El Jig√ºe\\", \\"Cerro Pelado\\", \\"Veguitas\\", \\"El Meri√±o\\" and \\"El Salto\\", in which for his outstanding work he finally reached the rank of captain. In the course the construction of several hospitals that were built in the Sierra during the rebellion, where many soldiers of the Rebel Army were saved, under Fidel's orders, he again acted as a doctor while he assumed the position of the arsenal of war and recorded the accounts of the teams. During the Batista offensive, he acted with the guerrillas as a front- line doctor, attending to the wounded in combat. When Fidel Castro ordered Commander Eduardo Lalo Sardi√±as to go forward with Column No. 12, Sim√≥n Bolivar, to stop the forces of tyranny get control of the border of Camag√ºey and Oriente and get them out of the way of invading columns of Ernesto Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos, as they advance towards Las Villas, Piti Fajardo plans the operations with Sardi√±as and Fidel's order is carried out.

After the victory of the revolution  When the armed struggle triumphed, Manuel Fajardo was promoted to commander, appointed as director of the Civil Hospital of Manzanillo and, later, director of the Military Hospital of Santiago de Cuba. He also assisted a congress in Porto Alegre (Brazil). Shortly after, he was appointed Chief of Operations for the Sierra and directed the capture operations of Manuel Beat√≥n's band. As a priority of the works of the Camilo Cienfuegos School City, he inaugurated the first unit with 500 ¬´camilitos¬ª, on July 26, 1960. For a period of time, in 1960, he was Fidel's family doctor, when the Chief of the Revolution suffered a respiratory condition.  Death  In November 1960 he was appointed Chief of Operations in the area of the Escambray Mountains, in the center of Cuba, with the task of cleaning the area of reactionary elements. In that effort, he was mortally wounded and killed in a confrontation on November 29 of the same year in a rural area 4.5 km west of the town of Trinidad (Las Villas province). He was 30 years old.

The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 5.1, and a shallow depth of . Shaking was reported throughout the Southern, Midwestern, and Northeastern United States. It was the strongest earthquake recorded in North Carolina in 104 years, the second-strongest in the state's history, and the largest to strike the East Coast since the 2011 Virginia earthquake.  Geology  The earthquake occurred near the Piedmont region and Blue Ridge Mountains, part of the eastern Appalachian Mountain range which formed due to an ancient continental collision with the African Plate roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician period. Many thrust faults were formed during this time as the mountain grew in size. When Pangea broke up, the uplift of the Appalachians ultimately ceased, leading to increased erosion rates due to the steep terrain. Ever since, the mountains have been gradually diminishing in size to their current state today. The mountains also played a role in where the quake was felt, with \\"DYFI\\" reports sharply decreasing west of the Appalachians. Erosion carries sediments out of the mountains and down towards the Atlantic Ocean (on the east side) and the Gulf of Mexico (on the west). This movement of sediment can alleviate the pressure of overlying rocks and cause ancient faults (once active during the mountain building processes) to reactivate and create earthquakes. It is believed this is a factor in the 2020 Sparta earthquake as well as others in the region such as the 2011 Virginia earthquake. The area of the earthquake is located marginally within the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone.. WLOS (user ABC13Channel). August 10, 2020. The ETSZ is responsible for a number of moderate-sized earthquakes in the past, with the last notable earthquake occurring in eastern Tennessee in 2018.  Earthquake  Illustrations depicting the movement of normal and reverse faults. The 2020 Sparta earthquake's movement was reverse (right image). DYFI (\\"Did You Feel It?\\") responses showing perceived shaking intensity The focal mechanism for the earthquake suggest oblique-reverse faulting on either a northwest, or south-striking fault. It produced \\"Very strong\\" shaking, and over 100,000 reported feeling it.  Foreshocks  There were 8 foreshocks ranging from to 2.6, the earliest of which was a that occurred on August 8, one day prior to the 5.1 mainshock. Aftershocks  The strongest aftershock of the sequence was a that struck 2 days after the mainshock. In total, there were 20 recorded aftershocks as of 27 August 2020.  Impacts = Damage  Widespread damage occurred in Sparta, which had already been debilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina. Damages include collapsed ceilings, chimneys, and masonry; damaged water mains; cracked and deformed roads; uprooted headstones; and displaced appliances and items. Wes Brinegar, the town's mayor, issued a state of emergency to apply for FEMA and state financial aid. Damage was worse than initially thought, with at least 525 structures being damaged, and 60 with major damage, meaning at least 40% of the structure was a total loss. 19 people lost their homes, 25 were declared uninhabitable, and scammers took advantage of the damage, charging people up to $500 USD for repairs, but never showing up. Governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, toured the damage in Sparta, releasing a statement later, stating \\"We‚Äôve dealt with a hurricane, a violent tornado, and now an earthquake all in the middle of a pandemic: North Carolinians are resilient.\\"  Injuries  There were no fatalities.

She studied at √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Hooee taught pottery making on the Zuni reservation and helped preserve the traditional techniques she learned from her grandmother, Nampeyo.  Biography  Hooee was a Hopi-Tewa potter and was born in 1906 or 1910. Hooee grew up in Hano on First Mesa, Arizona. She learned to paint pottery from her grandmother, Nampeyo, before she was ten years old. Hooee discovered that she had cataracts and might go blind around age ten while she was attending Phoenix Indian School. Anita Baldwin, an arts patron, provided surgery for Hooee in California and then went on to give her a formal education. Baldwin took her to school in Paris, where she studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and showed her around the world. Hooee lived with Baldwin for around ten years. Hooee returned to the Hopi community when her mother, Annie Healing, began to have health issues. She settled in Polacca, Arizona where she worked as a cook in a school. In the 1920s, Hooee worked with the Zuni and formed a dancing and singing group, the Olla Maidens, which as a group continue to perform today. Her son, Raymond Naha, who also became an artist, was born in Polacca in 1930. Hooee married her first husband, Ray Naha, in 1935. Around that time, she worked with archaeologists from the Peabody Museum on the Awatovi excavation. She later divorced Naha, and moved to Zuni, where she married Leo Poblano, a silversmith, in 1938. Poblano died fighting the Woodwardia forest fire in the Angeles National Forest in California in 1959. Later, she married another silversmith, Sidney Hooee. Hooee died either in 1994 or 1998. A biography about her life, Daisy Hooee Nampeyo () was written in 1977. She is also featured in a 1981 documentary, The Pueblo Presence, by Hugh and Suzanne Johnston and produced by WNET.  Work  Hooee's work has several influences. She was trained to create pottery by her grandmother, Nampeyo, and her earlier work reflects that style which is based on the Sikyatki. Hooee was also influenced by the style of pots excavated at Awatovi. She also had Zuni influences in her work, using white clay and a particular \\"high shouldered water jar form.\\" Hooee's pottery is created using clay mined locally. Her work was polychrome. Work is fired in ovens using sheep dung as fuel, or coal when available. Hooee signed her work \\"Nampeyo.\\" For a short period, Hooee created sculpture and did some work with relief settings and silversmithing. She and her husband, Leo Poblano, a silversmith, introduced the relief work to the Zuni people. Hooee also taught pottery at Zuni High School. In the mid 1970s, she worked on the Zuni Pottery Project where she taught Zuni potters how to make traditional pots. It was important to Hooee that the craft of making pottery through traditional methods did not die out. She also lectured and did demonstrations of her work, with one school, the Honolulu Academy of Arts, importing 400 pounds of sheep dung for the pottery oven during her appearance in 1974. Hooee has work in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

The building contains a minaret, and community facilities. Associated with the Albanian Australian community, \\"Certain mosques become associated with certain ethnic or national groups; such as the Lebanese or Lakemba Mosque (Sydney) or Albanians at the Carlton Mosque (Victoria). This is because Islamic groups or associations are usually formed along lines of ethnicity or nationality.\\" the mosque is owned by and the centre of the Albanian Australian Islamic Society (AAIS) of Victoria, whose membership numbers some 1000 people. Built in the late 1960s, the mosque is the oldest in Melbourne and listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. History Following the Second World War, Muslim immigrants such as Albanians migrated to Victoria and found the state lacking Islamic infrastructure. Makeshift mosques belonging to previous Melbourne Muslims existed decades before, often an adapted small room for religious services, but none were long lasting. In 1961, Muslim immigrants formed the Islamic Society of Victoria (ISV) to cater for their religious needs, with Albanians comprising its largest number of donors. ISV members met in an adapted small house on 1008 Drummond Street, Carlton that served for a brief period as a mosque, becoming the centre for its Islamic Community of Carlton association and of Muslim life. In 1963, the Albanian community established an organisation named the Albanian Australian Islamic Society (AAIS). By the late 1960s, Albanians in Melbourne travelled far to the Albanian mosque in Shepparton, Victoria for Bajram (Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha) celebrations and Muslim burial services (janaza). Due to wide geographical distances between both Albanian communities, phone calls were expensive and telegrams sent only when a death occurred. The situation motivated the Melbourne Albanian community, who by that time were to varying degrees financially established to build a mosque within the city. Fundraising was successfully undertaken by AAIS with one of its founders, Memet Zuka, a community leader seeking and receiving donations from Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox members of the Albanian community. AAIS purchased a property at 765 Drummond Street, Carlton. It contained a Victorian period two story house, previously the home of past Victorian Police Commissioner Thomas O'Callaghan, and an adjacent large empty plot of land. The initial design of the mosque building was square with brownish bricks. Construction began in 1967 and finished in 1969. \\"the Albanian Muslim community has established two mosques, a rural mosque at Shepparton opened in 1960 and another in an inner city area of Melbourne in 1969.\\" The mosque since its establishment, apart from being a centre for Albanian religious and cultural activities has also provided assistance to other communities. For instance, Albanians in the 1970s shared their mosque with newly arriving Turkish immigrants, becoming at the time an important centre for the Turkish Australian community. Other arrivals, such as students from Southeast Asian countries (Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia) received assistance from the mosque. In the 1970s and 1980s, a Muslim Palestinian volunteer at the mosque, Omar Hallak taught the Quran and Arabic language. In 1981, Rexhep Idrizi, became the imam at the mosque. A minaret was added to the mosque in 1994, after permission was granted by the High Court of Australia. The building underwent major renovations in 2003 resulting in the addition of a number of new facilities, the mosque exterior painted white and the installation of red carpet, to reflect the colour of the Albanian flag. Idrizi continued as imam until his dismissal by the AAIS board in May 2011, reportedly due to his opposition toward constructing a unit on the mosque premises. He challenged the board decision and attempted to reinstate himself through some community support during Ramadan prayers on 31 July 2011. Mosque officials opposed the move prompting police mediation that resulted in the acceptance of the status quo. Dr Bekim Hasani succeeded as imam of the mosque. In solidarity with victims of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, the mosque like others in Victoria held an open day (17 March) for the public to support or acquaint themselves with Islam and Muslims. AAIS held a celebratory outdoor festival at the mosque on 17 November 2019 marking its 50th anniversary, attended by some 3000-4000 people. It included Muslim Australians of Albanian and other backgrounds, non Muslim Australians of other faiths, political representatives (local MP Adam Bandt and City of Yarra mayor Danae Bosler), heads of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and some police officers. Simultaneously, an exhibition was held inside the mosque showcasing its history. For the occasion and the first time in its history, the call to prayer (adhan) was performed by Amet Balla from the mosque minaret and heard in the surrounding area through its loudspeakers. During its 50 year history, the mosque congregation, including donors has become diverse and originating from various ethnicities. Imam Hasani left the mosque in 2020 to become head of sharia affairs at the Islamic Coordinating Council of Victoria (ICCV). The current imam is Perparim Sula.

Eli recognizes Tyler from the news coverage of his fianc√©‚Äôs disappearance. Tyler asks Eli about Xylon Inc., but Eli says he‚Äôs never seen any company employee on the land before. He takes Tyler to a spot in the woods where centuries before, the Chinook marked their own border along the trees with special bone symbols, indicating an area not to venture into. He tells Tyler of the Chinook legends about creatures in the area ‚Äúnot friendly to man‚Äù and reveals he is looking for what he calls ‚Äúthe Big Man‚Äù. Back at camp, they find a tree has been uprooted and the trunk shoved into Eli‚Äôs fire pit. After hearing a roar in the distance, the pair ventures past the Chinook symbols. Tyler runs in the direction of the sound and falls into a small marsh-like clearing of smashed trees and decomposing carcasses. When Eli helps him up, a boulder is thrown from the trees and breaks Eli‚Äôs leg. Tyler fires off several shots and drags Eli to safety as it starts to snow. Leaving Eli with his revolver, he returns to the feeding ground to retrieve his backpack. He finds Natalie‚Äôs engagement ring in the dirt while collecting his gear, when the Beast appears. He runs from the area and back to Eli. Using his gear, he splints Eli‚Äôs leg and together they escape the Beast‚Äôs area, emerging on the other side near a river. They make camp, surrounded by four fire pits for protection, and take watch while trying to fish with a makeshift rod. Several days pass, and Eli suggests Tyler leave him and save himself, but Tyler refuses. Eli sneaks off on his own when Tyler is asleep, using the rifle for support. When Tyler wakes, he follows the path Eli‚Äôs made in the snow, coming upon the broken rifle and the Beast feeding on Eli‚Äôs corpse. The Beast sees him and claws Tyler‚Äôs shoulder before he is able shoot it with his revolver, causing it to run off. He returns to camp and stitches himself up, before arming himself with his revolver and several makeshift weapons and making his way back to Eli‚Äôs camp. Tyler sets a trap at the camp and uses Eli‚Äôs truck‚Äôs horn to lure the Beast to the campground, then engages it in a fight. He finally shoots a propane tank and throws a lit flare into the fuel causing the tank to explode while the Beast is incapacitated next to it; the Beast runs into the forest, engulfed in flames. Later, a man driving along a mountain highway sees an exhausted Tyler emerge from the trees and collapse on the road. Tyler wakes up in a hospital where a nurse is administering to him. A wheelchair bound man introduces himself as Jackson Wells and tells Tyler that he believes his Bigfoot claims because he too, has ‚Äúseen monsters‚Äù. He is not convinced Tyler killed the beast, despite the extensive injuries he inflicted, and then tells Tyler he is part of a team and that he‚Äôs recruiting, then the film ends. Cast *Kevin Makely as Tyler Laird, an 12-year army veteran *Todd A. Robinson as Eli Verunde, a poacher hunting in the off season *Summer Spiro as Natalie, Tyler's missing fianc√© *Amanda Wyss as Doctor Wheeler *Lance Henriksen as Jackson Wells *Adrienne Barbeau as Rita Laird *Skotty Masgai as The Beast *Ashley Platz as Nurse Katie Production Big Legend writer/director Justin Lee grew up in the Pacific Northwest and drew inspiration for the film from local Bigfoot legends he heard while growing up. Shot in an area of Washington Lee was familiar with, nearly a week into filming, the state saw its biggest snow storm in 30 years, which covered the area overnight with as much as two feet of snow in some places. This meant the snow had to be incorporated into the film's script. Lee explained they achieved this by editing different shots of the snow levels in the area into the various parts of the film to build up to the high levels of snow the crew were left with after the storm. Lee emphasized his desire to use practical effects in the film, but also to make \\"this one-man movie where he‚Äôs on the hunt for this creature, similar to Predator\\". He cited Jaws as an inspiration for their approach to this film's Sasquatch, utilizing Spielberg's technique of not revealing the monster in full until the film's climax. Lee cast Kevin Makely due to his longtime friendship with the actor and said that Makely wanted the role due to his personal belief in Bigfoot. The role of Tyler's mother was initially not in scripted, but regarding the character and the casting of Adrienne Barbeau, Lee said: \\"we realized maybe we needed to have something that helped people relate to what Tyler was going through...so I knew I had to bring her in and thought [Barbeau] would be great in this role in particular, because of her performances on Carniv√†le\\". Release The film premiered at the 2018 Portland Horror Film Festival (which took place June 13-16) and screened at the Hollywood Theater in Portland, Oregon. It was released on DVD and VOD on July 3rd, 2018 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and reportedly made $41,839 in DVD sales. Reception Critical reception for the film has been mixed. Rotten Tomatoes currently holds two reviews of the film, one \\"rotten\\" and one \\"fresh\\". Roger Moore from RogersMovieNation.com, argues the film has a few good scares and \\"stages good attacks and fights\\" but heavily criticizes the characters and plot, and also calls the film's set up for future installments \\"deluded\\", ultimately awarding it 1.5/4 stars. Chuck Foster from Film Threat and praises the film's performances, particularly Makely's and notes that despite the film's micro-budget, it still manages to pull off some excellent creature effects. The reviewer awards the film 8/10 stars and says \\"Big Legend isn‚Äôt here to change your mind about politics or make you feel some deep emotion. This is pure mindless entertainment of the highest drive-in quality\\". Bloody Disgusting published a review of the film in 2018 coinciding with its release on DVD and VOD. The review is mostly positive calling the film \\"a surprisingly compelling survival story with more than a few surprises up its sleeve\\". The review makes note of Makely's performance and says that he carries the film. The major criticism is given to the \\"very mundane\\" looking Bigfoot and says that the film overall is lacking polish, but awarded it 3.5/5 skulls (stars). Dread Central published a mixed review nearly a week after the film's release on DVD. The review praises the film's climax and the performances in the film but cites its slow pacing and lack of Bigfoot violence as the main detractors. The reviewer also notes that the film does an admirable job of building excitement for \\"a Dark Universe of his own using Mythical Monsters\\" and rates the film 2.5/5 stars. Sequel The film's end credits begin with the following message: \\"Tyler Laird and Jackson Wells will return in The Monster Chronicles\\". Director/writer Justin Lee said the casting of Lance Henriksen was integral, calling him a \\"linchpin in our future plans for this world, and there was no one better than Lance Henriksen to play that character\\". He also mentioned that Amanda Wyss' character may also appear in The Monster Chronicles. In regards to the future of the series Lee said: > You will definitely see some of these faces more. There are multiple films > planned as of right now, and we are planning out a lot more practical > creature effects, too. There are some creatures I think that you've heard > of, and there are some that you might not have heard of, but you will see > different looks for what we‚Äôre planning. One of my favorite movies of all > time is The Monster Squad, and I don't think we've had the same thing in a > movie in a very long time where you've got monster hunters chasing down > multiple monsters.

After winning her only race as a juvenile in 2002 she developed into a top-class performer in the following year, winning the UAE 1000 Guineas, Galtres Stakes and Prix Vermeille. She was also placed in the Lupe Stakes, Ribblesdale Stakes and Prix de Psych√©. She had some success as a broodmare. Background Mezzo Soprano was a dark bay or brown mare with an elongated white star bred in Kentucky by her owner Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She was sent into training with Andr√© Fabre at Chantilly. She was sired by Darshaan who won the Prix du Jockey Club for the Aga Khan in 1984 before becoming a successful breeding stallion. The best of his other offspring included Dalakhani, Hellenic, Mark of Esteem and Kotashaan. Mezzo Soprano's dam Morn of Song showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from four starts. She was a daughter of the outstanding Canadian mare Glorious Song, making her a half-sister to Singspiel and a full-sister to Rahy. Racing career=2003: two-year-old season On her first and only start as a two-year-old Mezzo Soprano started the 1.3/1 favourite for the Prix de Grandouet, a maiden race over 1600 metres on very soft ground at Deauville Racecourse on 10 August. Ridden by Olivier Peslier she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won \\"easily\\" by a length from State of Art, a filly who went on to win the Prix de la Nonette. At the end of the year the filly was transferred to the ownership of Godolphin and sent to Dubai where she joined the training stable of Saeed bin Suroor. 2004: three-year-old season Mezzo Soprano began her second campaign at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse on 13 March when she contested the UAE 1000 Guineas over 1600 metres on dirt in which she was ridden by Kerrin McEvoy and won by three lengths from Gonfilia after taking the lead 300 metres from the finish. Godolphin's racing manager Simon Crisford commented \\"She is a super filly, was working very well and we had high hopes for her. She won very well at Deauville last summer and is a lovely filly with a bright future\\". On her return to Europe Mezzo Soprano went off the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting for the 1000 Guineas on 4 May over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse but after racing prominently she dropped away in the closing stages and came home fourteenth of the nineteen runners behind Russian Rhythm. Seventeen days later she was dropped back to Listed class for the Lupe Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse and finished second to Ocean Silk. At Royal Ascot on 19 June she was moved up in distance to contest the Ribblesdale Stakes over one and a half miles and briefly took the lead in the straight before being overtaken and coming home third behind Spanish Sun and Ocean Silk. In the Prix de Psych√© at Deauville on 9 August she led for most of the way but was headed 200 metres from the finish and ran third behind Commercante and Baie. Twelve days later the filly was ridden by Frankie Dettori in the Listed Galtres Stakes over one and a half miles at York Racecourse and started the 4/1 joint favourite alongside the Henry Cecil-trained Singleton. After tracking the leaders she took the lead approaching the final furlong and kept on well to win by a neck from the 16/1 outsider Thingmebob. On 14 September Mezzo Soprano was ridden by Dettori when she went off at odds of 8/1 in the Group 1 Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. The Prix de Pomone winner Vallee Enchantee started favourite while the other nine runners included Yesterday, Ocean Silk, Fidelite (Prix Saint-Alary), Casual Look, State of Art, Commercante and Whortleberry (Prix Minerve). Mezzo Soprano settled behind Butterfly Blue who set the pace before giving way to Casual Look who turned into the straight with a three length advantage. Mezzo Soprano took the lead from Casual Look 200 metres from the finish and stayed on well under pressure to repel the late challenge of Yesterday and win by a head. Crisford commented \\"That was her Arc. She comes from such a prestigious family and Sheikh Mohammed will decide where she goes next\\". For her final race, Mezzo Soprano was sent to California for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Santa Anita Racecourse on 25 October where she made little impact and came home unplaced behind Islington. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Mezzo Soprano became a broodmare for the Darley Stud. She produced at least three winners from five foals: *Claremont, bay colt, 2006, by Sadler's Wells. Won four races including the Prix du Lys, Aston Park Stakes and Nad Al Sheba Trophy. *Perfect Note, bay filly, 2007, by Shamardal. Won one race, dam of the Prix de Malleret winner Strathspey. *Conservatoire, bay filly, 2009, by Street Cry. Unraced. *Ibtasama, bay filly, 2010, by Street Cry. Unraced. *Opera Dame, bay filly, 2013, by Medaglia d'Oro. Won one race. Mezzo Soprano died in 2013 at the age of thirteen.

Due to Canada's colonial history and federal constitution indigenous education is a shared jurisdiction between Indian bands, Provincial and territorial governments, and the federal government. Educational attainment has historically been significantly lower for indigenous peoples in Canada compared to the non-indigenous population, and this is considered one of Canada's major social problems. Significant debate and controversy surround the issue of how to improve indigenous education outcomes. In particular there is controversy over how to interpret and respond to the history of Canada Indian residential school system, which was imposed on indigenous students from the late 19th to the late 20th century. Debate also surrounds issues of funding, access (especially in remote communities), cultural appropriateness, language revival, and accommodations for FNMI students in non-indigenous school systems.  Higher education  The educational attainment gap between indigenous and non-indigenous Canadians in trades programs and college diplomas has narrowed considerably since 2006, and was nearly gone by 2016. However, the gap in university degree attainment was still quite large.

The house was designed in a subtype of Queen Anne architecture known as free classical, which incorporated Neoclassical elements into the style. It includes a hexagonal tower, a rounded turret, a wraparound front porch, and multiple dormers. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 21, 1989.

Tschaikowsky' Swan Lake at the Wiener Staatsoper, 2004 Theatre photography first took place in the photographer's studio before the photographer could come to the theatre with the appropriate technical equipment and take pictures on stage. Theatre photography is a genre of photography. Its are performers on theatre stages as well as scenery or (rarely) prop or stage design. Trends in theatre photography are drama, opera, ballet, puppet theatre, cabaret, variety show and portraits of artists.  Genre  Theatre photography serves as documentation and advertising for a theatre. Documentation includes the capturing of an artistic expression, the presentation, the realization of the theme and also the stage design. Recordings of theatre scenes and performers are used in showcases, for theatre posters, programme booklets and advertisements. The most extensive use of theatre photos is in the media, mainly to illustrate reviews and reviews, more often to announce new productions. Professional theatre photographers are usually self-employed and are booked for the respective production, although contracts for the entire theatre season are quite common. Some large theatres have their own advertising department, in which permanently committed photographers also work.  Practice  The use of digital single-lens reflex camera and fast objectives with different focal length - depending on the size of the stage - enables the theater photographer to react to the most diverse light moods on stage. Many theatre photographers also shoot in raw image format to compensate for colour cast and deviating colour temperature in the digital workflow. In addition, digital photography allows a quick and timely publication of the photos in mass media. Photographs are mainly taken only during rehearsals so that the performance is not affected. There are often extra \\"photo and TV rehearsals\\" before the premiere, to which press photographers are invited. Photo and TV rehearsals, for example, are the standard in all theatres and opera houses in Berlin and Hamburg, Salzburg and Vienna.

It is a simple horizontal tricolor, composed of blue stripes at the top and bottom and a yellow one in the middle. Blue represents the sky and other values and elements, while yellow signifies the richness of Cimi»ôlia's cereals, very important in the history of the city. Previous proposals included the inclusion in the canton (corner) of the coat of arms of the city or a Tatar symbol called in Romanian. The process for the adoption of a flag for Cimi»ôlia was long. It began with a request by the mayor in March 2007. A contest was organized, but the proposals sent were ultimately rejected and the Cimi»ôlia City Council asked the National Heraldry Commission (CNH) and a local painter for assistance. They designed a flag that after long discussions and changes was adopted on 30 June 2010. Design The city of Cimi»ôlia has a rectangular flag with a 2:3 ratio. It is blue, with a yellow bar covering one fifth of the flag. Blue represents the color of the sky, infinity, dreams and a peaceful and free life. On the other hand, yellow represents the richness of cereals. Cimi»ôlia was a highly important locality due to its cereal trade, which managed to exceeded 500,000 rubles. Today, agriculture remains important in the city's economy. According to one of the authors of the flag, it was designed using vexillological methods based on the coat of arms, preserving all its meanings. History The coat of arms of Cimi»ôlia, which was the basis for the flag and was used on it in earlier versions In March 2007, the mayor of Cimi»ôlia, Ion Alexandreanu, requested the collaboration of the National Heraldry Commission (CNH) to create a coat of arms and flag for the city. The preparatory documentation for this lasted a year, and in early 2008, a competition was announced. Participants would send their submissions for a coat of arms and flag, being 12 March 2008 the deadline. Contest winners would win two cash prizes of 1000 lei (almost $100 then) each. On 10 March, the Cimi»ôlia City Council issued a decision setting up a commission to elaborate the city's symbols and approving its working regulations. This commission consisted of ten people. The president was the mayor Gheorghe RƒÉileanu (who had replaced Alexandreanu), while the secretary was Radion Nechit, a specialist in juvenile and sportive problems. Another notable member was the vice mayor Sergiu Ple»ôca, whose actions were decisive during the process in later years. The winner of the contest was the geography teacher Eremei Lavric. He received the award of 1000 lei and became the leader of the process for the adoption of a flag and coat of arms. For the former, he had a proposal. It would consist of a horizontal bicolor flag composed of a yellow strip and a lilac one, with the coat of arms he proposed in the middle. Lavric's proposals presented several artistic, heraldic and semantic problems, and some of the elements he used were not considered sufficiently \\"individualizing\\" by the local authorities. At the end of 2008, the Cimi»ôlia City Council requested the assistance of the CNH and the painter Victor Hristov, a native of Cimi»ôlia, to make new designs. Therefore, the heraldist and vexillologist Silviu Andrie»ô-Tabac (a member of the CNH) made a flag, painted by Hristov. It was rectangular with a blue background and a yellow strip in the middle. In addition, it had a (a tool for livestock) in the canton (corner). This , also yellow, represented a Tatar tribe known in Romanian as the from which the name of Cimi»ôlia originates. The consisted of a ring with a line, straight at first and inverted at the end. This tricolor was supported and liked by various citizens. Regarding the coat of arms, Hristov and Andrie»ô-Tabac designed a project. Both proposals were drawn up in December 2008 and artistically and technically defined at the end of March 2009. After this, they were presented to the local authorities. The mayor of Cimi»ôlia, with doubts about their quality, requested on 2 June 2009 an examination by the CNH of the two symbols to discuss them later in a city council meeting. The local authorities decided to separate the question of the flag and the coat of arms and on 16 June, they approved the coat of arms for the city. The CNH approved the coat of arms and the flag on 18 June, and later, it suggested the creation of alternative flag projects the City Council could agree with. Andrie»ô-Tabac tried to convince the local authorities to use the original project, and on 4 February 2010, the Cimi»ôlia City Council approved the flag, replacing the with the city's coat of arms after debating the possibility. The latter is composed of a Roman silver balance in whose weighing pan is a golden ear of grain. The same day, the regulations for the use of the flag were approved. In order to start raising the flag over the town hall of the city, the CNH had to approve this flag first. However, the CNH rejected it on 26 May, reporting that it did not follow vexillological rules as the coat of arms at the corner of the flag was very complicated and unrecognizable from a certain distance. The CNH proposed reusing the original project or removing any emblem from the canton. At the end, on 30 June 2010, the City Council approved a flag with nothing in the corner. The was kept in the coat of arms. The adoption of the flag and the coat of arms was ultimately confirmed on 25 March 2015 after the decision nr. 324-IV.01 of the CNH.

Associated with the Albanian Australian community, the mosque is owned by and the centre of the Shepparton Albanian Moslem Society (SAMS). Built in the late 1950s, the mosque is the first and oldest in Victoria. History Most Shepparton Albanians originate from the Kor√ß√´ region in south-eastern Albania. The Shepparton Albanian community began with immigrants arriving in Fremantle, Western Australia (1924), later relocating to Queensland for agricultural employment, and eventually moving to Shepparton (mid 1920s) becoming one of the earliest Muslim communities to settle there. Shepparton Albanians became a well integrated successful community, with many employed as market gardeners and orchardists. In the interwar period until the 1950s, Shepparton Albanians associated being Muslim as closely connected to being an Albanian, significant elements that contributed to their place in the country and established sentiments of community among its members. Prior to the mosque's existence, Albanians wanting to perform Friday prayers would visit each others homes, however over time with the growth of the community it became infeasible. Post-war, unable to go back to Albania, the community desired to establish a permanent structure. Unlike Christian Albanians, Muslim Albanians had no Muslim infrastructure they could access in the area and the need for a large building arose that could serve as a place to congregate and hold community events. The mosque symbolised the Albanian community's intention to remain in their new homeland. In 1953, the local Albanian community established an organisation named the Shepparton Albanian Moslem Society (SAMS). The creation of the Albanian Society was in part due to the Cold War, its members thought that individuals with communist sympathies would be hesitant to join a mosque, unlike an ethnic-based organisation. The Albanian community perceived its actions to be line with its ethos of being loyal Australians accepted by the Australian government. Finances for mosque construction were fundraised by Albanians from within their community, and donations for the project came from its members employed in local farm work. The foundation stone of the mosque was laid by Shepparton Albanians in 1956, construction began thereafter and finished in 1960. \\"the Albanian Muslim community has established two mosques, a rural mosque at Shepparton opened in 1960 and another in an inner city area of Melbourne in 1969.\\" Apart from Albanians, people involved in the mosque construction were local Australians and other non-Albanian immigrants who lived in the area. At the time, the mosque location was at Shepparton's outskirts, on a dirt and at times muddy street. Shepparton council laid gravel on the road in preparation for the opening ceremony and to ensure accessibility to the mosque for arriving dignitaries and Albanian community members. At the ceremony, the mosque was opened by the Indonesian ambassador Dr. A.Y Helmi and speeches were given by non-Muslim dignitaries. Many local non-Muslims also attended the ceremony and it was broadcast and reported on by the ABC national media network. The Shepparton mosque was one of the first members of the Australian Federation of Islamic Societies (AFIS). In the late 1960s, Albanians from Melbourne travelled far to the Shepparton mosque for Bajram (Eid al-Fitr and Eid al- Adha) celebrations and Muslim burial services (janaza). The difficulties over geographical distances with Shepparton motivated Albanian Melburnians to build a mosque within their own city. The mosque was also used by Shepparton Turkish Australians until 1988 when they built their own mosque in another suburb of the city. Since its establishment, the mosque has been a significant place for Shepparton Albanian community activities, catering to its needs such as being important for the maintenance of its religious identity and worship. SAMS, as a committee is in charge of maintaining the mosque, its finances and membership, and organises other community events like the Albanian Harvest Festival celebrating Albanian culture and Albania, Albanian Independence day, New Years celebrations and other functions. Fundraising for the mosque and SAMS also occurs during the Harvest Festival, held annually at the Shepparton Showgrounds. These SAMS events attract Albanians from other areas in Victoria to Shepparton and are important in connecting the dispersed Albanian community. In the 1990s, some discord flared between new arriving Albanian migrants from previously atheist communist Albania and the older Albanian community. The new Albanian immigrants, though many stating they were Muslims perceived SAMS as a non-secular organisation with religious overtones and refused to join it or partake in their events, instead organising their own functions for some time. For the older Albanian community, the mosque and SAMS has served as a focal point for keeping contact with friends, relatives and instilling a sense of roots in the area. The mosque for newer Albanian arrivals lacked significance and some viewed it as a barrier to integration in Australia. Albanians in Shepparton are secular or non-observant Muslims, with a few devout in Islam. In the late 2000s, artifacts from the mosque were donated to Museums Victoria. They include a building trowel used by R. Sherif Islam and Myrteza Adem in placing the foundation stone (1956), and a 300 year old Quran from Ohrid, North Macedonia, donated by Erik Lloga (late 1990s) to celebrate the establishment of a community centre extension to the mosque. SAMS for some years devoted efforts toward having the towns of Shepparton and Kor√ß√´ establish a twin-town relationship, a goal achieved in 2013. In solidarity with victims of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, the mosque like others in Victoria held an open day in March for the public to support or acquaint themselves with Islam and Muslims. Structure The mosque is a large structure and reflects a building style that incorporates parts of traditional architecture with popular architectural elements in 1960s Shepparton. The brickwork is of a white cream colour. Atop on all sides is a crenellated parapet that contains some decorative brown infill brickwork and the roof has 4 small domes. There are vertical pointed lancet windows on one side and rectangular windows on the other, all with white frames. The entrance is a centralised white rendered panel and its upper section has a pointed arch with coloured glass. Above that is written in gilded letters \\"Moslem Mosque\\". The second half of the centralised panel consists of two white framed doors with glazed rectangular panes, and in front the canopy has two squared brick columns. There are landscaped gardens on the premises.

He dedicated himself to woodworking throughout his life, held various positions of responsibility in the Barcelona Wood Union, belonged to the anarchist group \\"Nosotros\\", held the position of commander of the South Ebro Column, he also served an officer in the French Resistance and participated in a botched attack against Franco. After the Spanish Civil War he went into exile in France and later in Latin America.  Biography = Childhood and adolescence  He was born in the Poblenou neighborhood of Barcelona, the son of Valencian emigrants from Pedralba. Poblenou, being an industrial center, developed a deep union life in which Ortiz participated: at the age of 8 or 9 he attended a talk by √Ångel Pesta√±a and regularly attended the Flor de Mayo cooperative where cultural activities were developed. At the age of 11, he began to work, as a result of his father's accident, to attend to family needs. From that age he worked in different carpentry shops and for some time he combined work and studies. In 1921, at the age of fourteen, he joined the CNT's Wood Union. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera he maintained the clandestine contribution, helped distribute Solidaridad Obrera and got involved in different cultural activities.  Militancy  Republic = With the fall of the dictatorship and the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, the CNT experienced a great expansion. The anarcho- syndicalist organization was experiencing a bitter debate at that time between the Trentistas and Fa√≠stas. Ortiz was akin to the Faist tendency, of which Buenaventura Durruti and Juan Garc√≠a Oliver were notable representatives. He published some articles in the CNT's newspaper, Solidaridad Obrera, joined the Poblenou defense committee and accepted responsibilities in the Wood Union, of which he was appointed president in 1932. A few days after his appointment, a strike by the cabinetmakers' section began when the employers did not accept the union's demands: a 44-hour week, that the tools were in charge of the employers and abolition of all week-long festivities except for May 1. The strike began on November 14 and ended in mid-April of the following year, its duration was due to the fact that the conflict was not reduced to a labor issue (It was understood that the requests were very moderate and would be accepted without problem), but was part of the power struggle between the CNT on the one hand and the UGT and the state on the other, entities that the anarchist union did not recognize. While the strike was taking place, Ortiz was arrested for another reason: the January 1933 insurrection. The police detained him on his way to L'Hospitalet after having clashes in Atarazanas and El Clot. During his detention, together with other detainees, he suffered torture which, although overshadowed by the events in Casas Viejas, was later denounced in the press. During his time in prison, he became friends with Garc√≠a Oliver, with whom he would show great ideological affinity and would be the one to later introduce him to the Nosotros group. Upon leaving prison at the end of 1933, he joined the group together with Durruti, Garc√≠a Oliver, Francisco Ascaso, Gregorio Jover, Ricardo Sanz, Jos√© P√©rez Ib√°√±ez and Aurelio Fern√°ndez. In mid-1935 he was arrested along with Durruti, Aurelio Fern√°ndez and Ascaso. The prisoners were transferred from Barcelona to the Valencia prison, where they left a few weeks before the 1936 elections were called. From the election to the war, Ortiz was very present at rallies and conferences. = The Civil War = The days prior to the coup of July 1936 were very busy for Ortiz: he made an arms exchange in Asturias and coordinated with some related officers to sabotage the coup. During the time that the fight lasted in Barcelona, he was present at the confrontations in Parallel and in the taking of the Atarazanas. . He was present at the meeting that representatives of the CNT had with Llu√≠s Companys and at the plenary session in which it was decided to collaborate with the other political forces. Once the fight in Barcelona was decided, the Committee of Antifascist Militias was formed, which ordered Ort√≠z to organize a column of militiamen to occupy the towns between Zaragoza and Caspe. The column left Barcelona on July 24 with around 800 men and arrived in Caspe on the next day. In addition to the militants from Barcelona, the column was reinforced by dispersed groups and other smaller columns. Finally the front was extended between Azuara and S√°stago, with 4 different sectors, and the general staff in Caspe. Ort√≠z participated in the extraordinary plenary session of unions in Bujaraloz which agreed on the creation, functions and powers of the Regional Defence Council of Aragon. In the debates that took place, he positioned himself as against the council having powers in matters of war and in favor of appointing Joaqu√≠n Ascaso as president of the council. During the process of militarization of the militias, which was subject to the columns accepting the change, he defended it due to the urgent need to obtain weapons for the front. Once finished, he went on to lead the 25th Division. Maneuvers of the communist 11th Division eventually led to the dissolution of the Council of Aragon, of the collectives, the imprisonment of Joaqu√≠n Ascaso and the repression of the libertarian movement in the area. Ort√≠z kept the 25th division in their positions and defended detained and persecuted militants on numerous occasions, turning the 25th division into a \\"refuge.\\" Shortly after the dissolution of the council, an offensive began on Zaragoza that pursued a triple intention: to create a distraction to the rebellious side in its northern campaign, to divert attention from the events in Aragon with an attempt to take Zaragoza, and to blame the lack of targets in the same offensive on the confederal divisions columns. As a result of his discrepancies with the way of directing the attack and his refusal to step down, he was relieved of his position on September 14 by Garc√≠a Vivancos. This replacement had been planned by the communists since July 1937. After his dismissal, he spent a few days in Valencia from where he broke Ascaso out of jail and returned to Barcelona. His destination was pending until December 1937, at which time he joined the Popular School of the General Staff, from which he left as an officer in February. After an attempt to withdraw Ricardo Sanz from the 26th Division, in which he saw an attempt to antagonize him and therefore began to suspect CNT's national committee, he ended up receiving command of the 24th Division, which covered the Segre river line. The Pyrenean position was precarious and Ortiz fundamentally believed that the Communist Party of Spain and even his own organization were setting traps for him to die. He was removed from command and the general staff. The suspicion that they wanted to assassinate him on the way led him to flee to France on July 5, 1938, with ten other men, among them Joaqu√≠n Ascaso.  Exile  France = They entered France and surrendered to the gendarmes, who took them to Bayonne, where they stayed for 4 days until the French authorities decided that they could not stay in the country and had to leave it. They then went to Andorra, where they were arrested and sent to Perpignan thanks to the efforts of a French deputy. They were there for a month, after which they were sent to different cities, leaving Ortiz in Privas. In September 1938 he and Ascaso suffered an assassination attempt. After surviving the poisoning, they went to Marseille. Here the French police detained them for an extradition demand from the Republican government, but it was voided in the first days of April, and they were released. They went to Paris where they survived off the solidarity of colleagues and acquaintances, because after their flight from Spain and government positions they were expelled from the CNT and stopped receiving the aid they provided. At the end of August, Ortiz went to Perpignan where he got a job through Gregorio Jover. In September, France and Britain declared war on Nazi Germany, complicating the situation for the exiles. The French police arrested Ortiz the same month and send him to the Saint-Cyprien concentration camp. From there he was sent to the fortress of Collioure, and after its closure he was sent to the Vernet d'Ari√®ge internment camp. Here, on May 10, 1940, he received the news that France had fallen to the Nazis. He remained imprisoned there for two years. = World War II = Those interned in the Vernet d'Ari√®ge Internment Camp that were regarded as more revolutionary and intransigent were deported to Algeria by the French government to work on the railway. He was released after the Allied invasion of North Africa, and he enlisted in the Free French Army as a volunteer for the entire duration of the war. He participated in several battles against the Nazi Afrika Korps and was promoted to sergeant. He embarked for France where the first Allied landing integrated into the French army took place. He progressed through Aix-en- Provence and Lyon, receiving various distinctions from his commanders. His most important participation occurred in the liberation of Belfort, which was worth a distinction signed by Charles De Gaulle. The body in which Ortiz was integrated continued its offensive into German territory, taking Karlsruhe and Pforzheim, where he was wounded. = Attack against Franco and exile in Latin America = After the end of the war and with the demobilization, Ortiz set up a sawmill in Saverdun together with his friend Jos√© P√©rez Ib√°√±ez. On September 12, 1948, he was part of a frustrated attack against Francisco Franco. The attack was to be carried out during a frigate competition, aboard a plane from which they would drop bombs. The attack failed because, although the information they had defended that there would be a multitude of planes and they would go unnoticed, there was no private plane flying over the sky. In February 1951, the French press reported the discovery of the plane, so he decided to emigrate to Latin America. He lived in Bolivia and Peru and in 1955 he settled in Venezuela, where he set up a carpentry shop. In 1987 he returned to Barcelona, where he was awarded a salary as a sergeant in the republican army. He died in a nursing home in the La Verneda neighborhood and bequeathed his body to medical research.

The exercises examined potential disruptions to the 2020 United States presidential election and transition. TIP is not an organization, but rather a short-term project run under the auspices of the organization Protect Democracy. Background The Transition Integrity Project was initially organized in late 2019 by Rosa Brooks, a law professor at Georgetown and former Pentagon senior official, and Nils Gilman, a former vice chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley and historian at the Berggruen Institute. Other participants in the Transition Integrity Project's exercises include: * Michael Steele‚Äîformer chair of the Republican National Committee * John Podesta‚Äîformer White House Chief of Staff to former President of the United States, Bill Clinton * Jennifer Granholm‚Äîformer Governor of Michigan * Trey Grayson‚Äîformer Secretary of State of Kentucky * Donna Brazile‚Äîformer Democratic National Committee Acting Chair * William Kristol‚Äîjournalist * Edward Luce‚Äîjournalist * Max Boot‚Äîjournalist * David Frum‚Äîjournalist The Transition Integrity Project (TIP) was launched, \\"out of concern that the Trump Administration may seek to manipulate, ignore, undermine or disrupt the 2020 presidential election and transition process.\\" War games=Methodology In the summer of 2020, TIP conducted a series of war-gaming exercises. The scenarios examined by TIP included: # Game One: Ambiguous. The first game investigated a scenario in which the outcome of the election remained unclear from election night and throughout gameplay. The results from three states are in contention and ballots are destroyed in one of the states, making it unclear who should have won that state. Neither campaign is willing to concede. # Game Two: Clear Biden Victory. Biden wins both the Electoral College and the popular vote. Trump alleges fraud and takes steps to benefit himself and his family but ultimately hands the White House over to Biden. # Game Three: Clear Trump Win. The third scenario started with an Electoral College victory for President Trump (286 to 252), but a popular vote win (52% to 47%) for former Vice President Biden. In this scenario Biden refused to concede, convinced the Democratic governors of two states that Trump won to send separate slates of electors to the Electoral College, encouraged three states to threaten secession and convinced the House of Representatives to refuse to certify the election and declare Biden the victor. # Game Four: Narrow Biden Win. The final scenario explored a narrow Biden win where he leads with less than 1% of the popular vote and has a slim lead at 278 electoral votes. The Trump campaign sows chaos but Senate Republicans and the Joint Chiefs of Staff eventually signal that they accept Biden's win. Trump refuses to leave and is removed by the Secret Service. Conclusions In August 2020, TIP released a report outlining its findings and recommendations. The report stated, \\"We [‚Ä¶] assess that the [sic] President Trump is likely to contest the result by both legal and extra-legal means, in an attempt to hold onto power. Recent events, including the President's own unwillingness to commit to abiding by the results of the election, the Attorney General's embrace of the President's groundless electoral fraud claims, and the unprecedented deployment of federal agents to put down leftwing protests, underscore the extreme lengths to which President Trump may be willing to go in order to stay in office.\\" The report's intention was to inspire the necessary changes to ensure a fair election in 2020. \\"These risks can be mitigated; the worst outcomes of the exercises are far from a certainty. The purpose of this report is not to frighten, but to spur all stakeholders to action.\\" Analysis The TIP report has sparked a national conversation about risks to the 2020 election and transition and means of mitigating those risks. Far-right conspiracy theory Far-right wing media outlets and commentators such as Michael Anton and Dan Bongino have promoted a baseless conspiracy theory that TIP was plotting a secret coup d'√©tat as part of plans by Democrats to lay a \\"groundwork for revolution\\"; these falsehoods went viral in right-wing circles ahead of Election Day, and stoked calls for violence among online right-wing extremists.

For this feat, the unit was cited, and its members granted the right to wear the Fourragere of the Croix de guerre. Later in the Spring of 1918, more modern SPAD XIIIs would replace the SPAD VIIs. On 5 June 1918, the escadrille was assigned to a Groupe de Combat commanded by Capitaine Raoul Echard. For the final months of the war, Escadrille 38 bounced about, supporting at various times IV Armee, V Armee, and VI Armee. By the ceasefire, Escadrille 38 had destroyed 98 German aircraft in aerial combat.

Early life  Stryker was born in Savannah, GA, in 1947 to George B. Stryker, Jr., a civil engineer, and Estelle R Stryker (n√©e Nulman), a nurse, shortly after both of them had returned from service in the Army during WWII in the Pacific. He was the first of 4 brothers, and the family moved every 2 years during his schooling in 4 states. During high school, he participated in civil rights actions with the Rev James Reeb. He was also a member of the winning team on the quiz show It‚Äôs Academic for 2 years running. He studied liberal arts at Deep Springs College and then the University of Michigan, where he graduated in philosophy and mathematics. After college, he joined the Peace Corps to work on water development in Kenya as an assistant hydraulics engineer, drawing on teachings from his father...  Professional education and career  In graduate school he studied neurophysiology at the new Department of Psychology and Brain Science (now Brain and Cognitive Sciences) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, first working with Professor Peter Schiller on the coding of eye movement and vision in the mammalian superior colliculus. He and Schiller then created the first computer-driven optical display capable of randomly interleaving sharply focused bar and edge stimuli and recording the responses of neurons in the visual system to measure their tuning properties quantitatively and objectively. Together with fellow student Helen Sherk, he used this apparatus to demonstrate innately selective responses in the visual cortex, confirming earlier qualitative studies of David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, and to reveal that the effect of restricted rearing was to preserve innately selective responses rather than to instruct the development of neurons to reflect visual experience. He received his Ph.D. in 1975. He pursued postdoctoral research in Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School School under the mentorship of Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel, working also with fellows Carla Shatz, Simon LeVay, and Bill Harris. With Shatz and Peter Kirwood, he taught a summer course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory taken by future UCSF colleagues Louis Reichardt, Yuh Nung Jan, Lily Jan, and audited by Francis Crick He joined the nascent Neuroscience Program at the University of California, San Francisco as a member of the Department of Physiology. There, his laboratory demonstrated a role for spontaneous neural activity as distinguished from visual experience in the prenatal and postnatal development of the central visual system. He and his students created influential and biologically realistic theoretical mathematical models of cortical development. He pioneered the use of the ferret for studies of the central visual system and used this species to delineate the role of neural activity in the development of orientation selectivity and cortical columns. His laboratory revealed a role for slow-wave sleep in cortical plasticity and pioneered the modern use of the mouse visual system, demonstrating rapid activity-dependent plasticity during a defined critical period and delineating distinct molecular mechanisms responsible for temporally distinct phases of plasticity. In collaboration with the Feldheim group at University of California, Santa Cruz, he revealed the interaction between neural activity and molecular signaling mechanisms responsible for the formation of azimuth maps in visual cortex and superior colliculus and the connections between them. His and the Alvarez-Buylla laboratory discovered that transplantation of embryonic inhibitory neurons into postnatal visual cortex induces a second critical period of juvenile plasticity. He and his colleagues made the fundamental discovery of the regulation of visual cortical state by locomotion and delineated much of the neural circuitry responsible. At UCSF, he led graduate programs and the Physiology Department, commented on discoveries in the field, and authored over 150 publications  Personal life  He has been married to Barbara Poetter since 1978. They have 4 children born between 1980 and 1995. They live in Marin County north of San Francisco.  Awards, recognition, and public service  Stryker is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. He holds the William Francis Ganong Chair of Physiology at UCSF and has held the Cattedra Galileiana (Galileo Galilei Chair of Science) at Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. He has received the W. Alden Spencer Award from Columbia University, the Pepose Vision Sciences Award from Brandeis University, the Stein Innovator Award from Research to Prevent Blindness, and the Krieg Cortical Kudos Discoverer Award from the Cajal Club.

Sriram and Mani Ratnam set up Aalayam Productions in 1990 and produced K. Subash's Chatriyan (1990) as their first venture. Featuring Vijayakanth and Bhanupriya in the lead roles, the film won critical acclaim and performed well at the box office.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/bombay-producer-s-sriram-passes- away-108337 Following the release of Roja (1992), director Mani Ratnam opted to stop making films for external production houses and chose to work solely for Aalayam Productions. The pair collaborated on Mani Ratnam's films including the heist comedy Thiruda Thiruda (1993) and the romantic drama Bombay (1995). As Bombay had faced political trouble prior to release, Sriram had said that he hoped that the film's plight and clearance would make it easier for future filmmakers to make films on religious riots without leading to controversy. Bombay went on to become one of the highest-grossing films from the Tamil industry and was also screened at many international film festivals. The studio also produced Vasanth's Aasai (1995), which gave actor Ajith Kumar his career breakthrough in the Tamil film industry. Mani Ratnam later left the production house in the mid-1990s to prioritise work on his own studio, Madras Talkies. Sriram died following a heart attack on 4 September 2019. Sriram was survived by his wife Nalini Sriram, a costume designer in the Indian film industry, and son, Nikhil Sriram.

Also known as the ‚ÄúSons of Satan‚Äù, it was part of the Marine Forces Reserve and based at Naval Air Station Los Alamitos, California, from 1946 through the 1960s. Originally commissioned during World War II, the squadron sustained enormous losses during the Battle of Midway and also saw extensive combat while providing close air support during the Philippines Campaign (1944‚Äì45). History= World War II Battle of Midway= Marine Scout Bomber Squadron 241 (VMSB-241) was formed at Midway Atoll on March 1, 1942 as part of Marine Aircraft Group 22 (MAG-22). From June 4‚Äì6, 1942 the squadron fought in the Battle of Midway where it lost 23 of its 30 aircraft and suffered 22 killed in action and 14 wounded in action. At 0605 on June 4 the squadron received word to scramble all of their aircraft to attack a Japanese aircraft carrier task force that had been spotted 180 miles of the atoll. VMSB-241 had divided into two striking units, the first composed of 16 SBD-2s led by Major Lofton Henderson, and the second of 11 SB2U-3s commanded by Major Benjamin W. Norris. Henderson's group climbed to 9,000 feet to locate the enemy carriers, which were then undergoing an attack from United States Navy TBFs and the B-26s. Fliers of this group sighted the Japanese ships at 0744, but as the SBDs spiraled down they were set upon by swarms of Nakajima B5Ns and A6M Zeros flying air cover, which were soon reinforced by more fighters from the carriers below. Henderson and several other were shot down (only eight of these planes got back to Midway) and the strike scored no hits although some were claimed. At 1700 a burning enemy carrier was reported 200 miles northwest of Midway, and Major Norris prepared VMSB-241's six operational SBD-2s and five SB2U-3s for a night attack. The planes took off at 1900, but could not find the carrier. Major Norris failed to return from this mission, although the other pilots managed to come home by the light of oil fires and the antiaircraft searchlights which were turned up as beacons. Early in the morning of June 5, 1942, Captain Richard E. Fleming's SB2U-3 Vindicator was hit and on fire as he continued his attack on the Japanese cruiser Mikuma. He maintained his dive, released his bomb and crashed directly into the cruiser. For this action he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. =1943 & 1944= VMSB-241 remained on Midway Atoll until March 1943 when it departed for Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Territory of Hawaii. On April 24, 1943, VMSB-241, now part of arrived at Tutuila where it remained for the next eight months. On December 16, 1943 the squadron moved up to Efate. Remained on island until February 2, 1944 when it moved to Piva on Bougainville. The squadron returned to Efate on March 18. On May 13, 1944 the squadron's flight echelon moved to Emirau to begin conducting bombing missions against the Japanese garrison on Rabaul. Ground echelon moved to Munda, Solomon Islands on Jun 18 and was joined by the flight echelon on July 8. =Philippines= On September 20, 1944, General George Kenney, Commander of the Far East Air Forces arrived on Bougainville and informed 1st Marine Aircraft Wing leadership that all of the wing's dive bomber squadrons were to be utilized to support the Sixth United States Army during the upcoming campaign to liberate Luzon. In preparation for departure, VMSB-241 was ferried from Munda to Bougainville on November 22-23. Marine Aircraft Group 24's ground echelons sailed from Bougainville on December 12 onboard four transport vessels. VMSB-241's flight echelon departed Emirau on January 19 heading for Peleliu via Momote and Owi. On January 25, 1944, the squadron finally got the nod to fly into the newly built airstrip at Mangaldan. On January 27, 1945, Major Ben Manchester, Commanding Officer of VMSB-241, led 18 of the squadron's SBDs in the first Marine Corps airstrikes on Luzon. The squadron attacked military targets in the vicinity of San Fernando. February and March saw VMSB-241 and the rest of MAG-24 providing close air support, flank protection and reconnaissance for the 1st Cavalry Division during its drive towards Manila. Combat operations on Luzon were discontinued on April 2 to allow the squadron to prepare for follow on operations in Mindanao. VMSB-241 departed Clark Air Base on April 20 bound for Malabang, Mindanao. The squadron, along with the rest of MAG-24, was tasked with supporting the 24th and 31st Infantry Divisions in their eastward push across Mindinao. During its time in the Philippines, VMSB-241 suffered six Marine killed in action and another six Marines wounded in action. On July 16, 1945, while stationed at Titcomb Field south of Malabang, VMSB-241 was ordered to decommission along with VMSB-133 by 1st MAW General Order No. 18-45.  Reserve years  Beginning in 1946, the squadron became part of the Marine Air Reserve based out of Naval Air Station Los Alamitos, California. It was brought back onto active duty in August 1950 at the outbreak of the Korean War and sent to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California where the unit's members were dispersed amongst other active duty units.

He is the vice president of the Serb List, an ethnic Serb minority political party in Kosovo.  Business career  Radoiƒçiƒá was born in 1978 in ƒêakovica (Gjakova) which at the time was a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the last ten years, he and his team and godfather Zvonko Veselinoviƒá have developed businesses throughout Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro, mainly in the field of trade and transport. His name first appeared in the media in 2013, when, together with Zvonko Veselinoviƒá, he was accused of aiding and abetting abuse, while Goran Makragiƒá and Ivan Stamenoviƒá were charged in the same public lawsuit for abuse of public position, Veƒçerenje novosti reported at the time. The indictment alleges that four defendants dug gravel on the Dimitrovgrad-Pirot section, which is part of Corridor 10, \\"without proper consent of the Ministry of Mining and Natural Resources, and without paying compensation to local authorities, and delivered it to builders on the route of the new road.\\" According to the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), Radoiƒçiƒá, together with his godfather, as he calls him in his statements, Zvonko Veselinoviƒá, was accused in 2012 of persuading Dragan ƒêuriƒçiƒá, who was the responsible person of the Euro cop company to keep 32 trucks after the lease expired and hand them over to them.Both were acquitted in 2015, while ƒêuriƒçiƒá was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The main reason why Radoicic was released is that he was in custody from September 2009 to February 2011, but the verdict does not state what he was accused of. He is a representative of FK Trepƒça. In 2019 Veselinoviƒá and Radoiƒçiƒá were acquitted of charges of illegal gravel excavation.  Political career  He is the vice president of the Serb List, an ethnic Serb minority political party in Kosovo. In the summer of 2017, Radoiƒçiƒá and Goran Rakiƒá, the president of the Serb List met with Behgjet Pacolli, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kosovo in Budva to discuss the possibility of the Serb List joining the government of Kosovo and supporting Ramush Haradinaj who is wanted by Serbia for crimes, as the prime minister. On 12 September 2017, the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, mentioned Radoiƒçiƒá as one of the \\"guardians of Serbia in Kosovo and Metohija\\". In a posthumous interview with BIRN, Oliver Ivanoviƒá, leader of the Freedom of Democracy and Justice Civic Initiative, described Radoiƒçiƒá as one of the main centers of power in North Kosovo and expressed concern that President Vuƒçiƒá mentioned him as a \\"guardian of Serbia\\". Ivanoviƒá was assassinated a few months later. Radoiƒçiƒá and Goran Rakiƒá participated in the meeting with President Vuƒçiƒá and Kosovo Serbs in Belgrade on 22 November 2018. A day later, the Kosovan police special unit ROSU arrested four people in the North Kosovo on 23 November in connection with the murder of Ivanoviƒá. Prime Minister of Kosovo, Ramush Haradinaj confirmed that Radoiƒçiƒá was one of the people suspected of the assassination of Ivanoviƒá. Radoiƒçiƒá said that he does not plan to give up because Kosovan police wants to murder him. On November 26, 2018, President Vuƒçiƒá told RTS that Radoiƒçiƒá certainly did not kill Ivanoviƒá and that he \\"did not participate in the organization, logistics, incitement\\" to murder. He added that Radoicic \\"was always the first to defend North Mitrovica\\". In July 2019, Kosovo prosecutor Sulj Hoxha stated that an international arrest warrant had been issued for Radoicic and pointed out that he was suspected of helping and organizing the group for the murder of Oliver Ivanovic, but also of being suspected of organized crime and drug trafficking.
