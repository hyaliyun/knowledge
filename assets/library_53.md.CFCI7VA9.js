The locality has a mixed ethnic culture, where communities speaking Urdu, Sindhi, Pushto, Saraiki and Hindko co-exist. Mehran Town is a part of Union Council (UC) 1, Korangi Town and is situated near Bilal Colony and Sharifabad. It has Malir River in its North-West and National Refinery on its East.  Controversy  Merhran Town was announced in 1973 by Karachi Development Authority (KDA). Payments were made in advance but basic utilities including water, electricity and gas were not provided in the housing project by KDA. Eventually, large areas of Mehran Town were encroached on and illegally possessed by land grabbers with the support from local politicians. Most of the construction in this part of the city is single- storied and cemented tiles have been used for the construction of roofs. Sector 6-C was initially planned for establishing industries in the area, however, nearly 200 residential units have also been illegally constructed there. Cottage industries have also been established on a few vacant plots. Sector 6-D is supposed to have 378 units but, in actuality, thousands of housing units exist here.  Lack of Basic Amenities  The haphazard construction has naturally led to a number of problems. Majority of the residents are living without any basic civic facilities. The sewerage system in some areas is on the verge of collapse, and in other areas, almost non- existent. Land mafia has dug up earth from empty plots, leaving behind huge pits which now turns into a massive pools of wastewater during rainy season. Only a few houses have a proper electric setup and the majority of the inhabitants have taken connections of electricity through illegal cables (Kunda system). A great number of consumers have to rely on bamboo poles to bring power lines to their homes since electricity poles have not been installed. A majority of inhabitants don‚Äôt have access to legal water supply lines and get water either through water tankers or illegal supply lines. Moreover, only 50 per cent of the population has access to gas supply. The remaining population depends on gas cylinders for cooking and other purposes. The locality also lacks a garbage lifting system as garbage can be observed scattered around in the area. There is no school or dispensary in the area. The children of the town go to Bilal Colony and other areas for getting education. Likewise, the patients are also taken to Bilal Colony for treatment. The locality does have some markets where grocery and other items of daily items are available.  Political Influence  The residents of the area have, reportedly, complained of red-tape. Whenever they approach a civic authority for a resolution to their problems, they are referred to a different authority. Local politicians have also been accused of collusion where in sector 6-C a majority of the plots are said to have been encroached by land grabbers supported by the former government of Pakistan People Party. Police staff and officials from the local Sharifabad Police Station has also been accused of willful negligence and corruption where they, reportedly, back encroachers and do not take any action on the matter.

Before that, it was known as the Berckentin and later the Schimmelmann Mansion after its successive owners. The Building is located on Bredgade, opposite Dronningens Tv√¶rgade for which it serves as a point de vue. It houses a concert hall which is open to the public. History=The Berckentin era The mansion was built as part of the redevelopment of the new Frederiksstaden district. It was designed by Johann Gottfried Rosenberg under the supervision of Nicolai Eigtved who had also conceived the district plan. It was built as a home for the wealthy merchant and politician Christian August von Berckentin who had just been ennobled with the title of count. After Berckentin's death in 1758, the Berckentin Mansion was taken over by his son-in-law, Christian Sigfred von Plessen, who also owned Glorup Manor on Funen, and had married von Berckentin's daughter Louise von Plessen n√©e Berckentin in 1744. Schimmelmann Mansion The Schimmelmann Mansion in the middle of the 18th century In 1762, Heinrich von Schimmelmann bought the property which now became known as the Schimmelmann Mansion. After his son Ernst Schimmelmann inherited it in 1782, the Schimmelmann Mansion became the centre of a colourful cultural life. Ernst and his wife, Charlotte Schimmelmann, shared a deep interest in the arts and Charlotte was famous for her salons. In the summer, these pursuits were relocated to their summer residence at S√∏lyst north of the city. Cultural references The building is used as a location in the 1997 film Smilla's Sense of Snow. It is also used as a location in an episode of the YV series Matador.

When introduced in 1973, it filled the gap between the Minica kei car and the considerably larger Galant. It was a replacement for the Colt 1200, last sold in 1970. Although sedan production ended in 1979, vans continued on until 1985. This Lancer also formed the basis for the Lancer Celeste sports coup√© of 1975 through to 1981. These Lancers were sold under a multitude of names in different markets. History=1973‚Äì1976 The Lancer A70 was launched in February 1973 in two- and four- door sedan form. It proved to be particularly successful in rallies, a claim that it retains to this day. The Lancer served to fill a gap in Mitsubishi's lineup in the small to lower-medium segment of the growing Japanese market. Twelve models were launched, ranging from a basic 1.2-litre sedan to a more powerful 1600 GSR model, successful in rallying. Chrysler Lancer (LA) GL sedan (Australia, A72A, pre-facelift) 1976 Mitsubishi Lancer GL sedan (NZ) There were three body styles (four if the Celeste liftback/coup√© is included), two- and four-door sedans and a rarely seen five-door station wagon introduced in September 1973. In October 1975 the smallest engine was replaced by another 1.2-litre four, the 80 hp 4G36. In November, the entire engine lineup lost around eight‚Äìnine percent of its power, as a result of the stricter emissions standards for 1976. Reflecting a popular appearance during the 1970s, the Lancer adopted \\"coke bottle styling\\" on the sedan and wagon for this entire generation. Originally, the Lancer received an OHV 1.2-litre Neptune 4G42, an OHC 1.4-litre Saturn 4G33 or the larger 1.6-litre 4G32. Power outputs were , , and respectively for what was called A71, A72 and A73 models. The 1600 GSR, introduced in September, used two Mikuni-made twin-barrel Solex carburetors for at 6,700 rpm. This vehicle was sold as the Colt Lancer in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other European countries. In some Latin American countries, as for example, in El Salvador, the car initially was known as the Dodge Lancer. This reluctance to use the Mitsubishi brand in many export markets stemmed from a fear of buyer resistance amongst those who could still remember fighting Japanese pilots in Mitsubishi A6M Zeros. In the Australian market, the first generation models were initially sold under the Chrysler Valiant Lancer name, with approximately 11,800 units sold between late 1974 and 1979. The original LA series was released in September 1974 in two levels of specification, a basic two-door EL and the four-door GL sedan which offered a higher level of equipment. Only one engine was offered, the 1,439 cc single cam, alloy-head four-cylinder engine rated at at 6,300 rpm. This could be paired with either an all-synchromesh four-speed manual, or a three-speed automatic. European market Lancers received the 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6-litre Saturn 80 engines, with claimed output of , , and DIN (GSR). The 1.6-liter engine was reserved for the two-door version, while four-door sedans only received the 1.4. Top speeds were 150, 155, and 165 km/h. 1976‚Äì1979 Mitsubishi Lancer GL (NZ; facelift) Mitsubishi Lancer sedan (NZ; facelift) In November 1976 the Japanese market models received a facelift, losing the previous L-shaped/upright rear lamps in favor of wide rectangular units. Front indicators were enlarged and moved, and new bigger rubber bumpers were also added, and new grilles were introduced. This generation gradually became the A140-series in Japan, reflecting the introduction of new engines. Since it kept the 4G32 engine, the GSR was referred to as an A73 until the very end in spite of having received all of the bodywork modifications. As a response to the new emissions standards taking effect in 1978, the 1.2-litre Saturn engine was replaced by the new 70 PS Orion G11B (1,244 cc) in April 1977. This was the new lean-burning MCA-Jet engine, which was added to the existing Saturn 4G33 and 4G32 engines in June. Power for these (now G33B/G32B) was reduced to and . It was this series that emerged in the United States as the Dodge Colt for the 1977 model year (Plymouth Colt in Canada), taking over from a badge- engineered Mitsubishi Galant from the previous year. It was offered for one more model year before the Dodge Colt name was gradually transferred to the front wheel drive Mitsubishi Mirage. The very large safety bumpers used in the American market were added to certain models in the domestic range in March 1978 (GL Extra, GSL, GSR) as part of one last minor facelift. This facelift also introduced the larger 1.4-litre Orion engine (G12B), of . April 1977 saw the introduction of the facelift model in Australia, designated locally as the LB series. This was discontinued in May 1979, having lost most of its market share to the bigger, locally built Chrysler Sigma.  1600 GSR The high- performance Mitsubishi Lancer 1600 GSR sold as the Colt Lancer 1600 GSR in Europe, was developed by Mitsubishi Motors to further their aspirations in off-road racing, especially the Safari Rally of Kenya. Thanks to repeated triumphs in what was the most gruelling rally in the world, it earned the nickname \\"King of Cars\\" in Africa. Mitsubishi Lancer 1600 GSR, Safari Rally winner 1974 In rally spec, the GSR produced at 7800 rpm and at 5500 rpm. Street versions originally developed , but this dropped to when tighter emissions standards were introduced for 1976. After sporadic successes with the Colt and Galant rally cars in previous years, Mitsubishi decided to develop a Lancer model specifically to tackle the notorious Safari Rally. Run over 6,000 km of arduous terrain under searing equatorial temperatures, the race was regarded as the toughest in the world, and typically only one car in five which set off from the start would manage to reach the finish line in Nairobi. Mitsubishi sanctioned official factory teams for the 1974‚Äì77 events, building for itself an enviable reputation for durability when only one of thirteen cars failed to finish in those four attempts. The high point was a clean sweep of the podium places in 1976. The car had previously demonstrated similar qualities in 1973, with its debut in the Australian Southern Cross Rally being rewarded with a clean sweep of the top four places. Works driver Andrew Cowan would go on to dominate this race in the '70s, winning five consecutive titles from 1972 to '76. Cowan and Joginder Singh also scored a 1‚Äì2 finish for the Lancer GSR at the 1977 Rallye Bandama C√¥te d'Ivoire. Even after production ended it remained a popular car with privateers into the 1980s. However, the decline of endurance rallying and the rise of the Group B class eventually signaled its demise.  Van/Wagon As there was no station wagon version of the Lancer EX, the first generation Lancer Van (wagon) continued in production for the home and select export markets until February 1985, by which time the car was conspicuously outmoded. When the 1.2-litre pushrod was replaced in 1975, Vans for the domestic market retained the old Neptune engine for an extra year, and the 1238/1439 cc Saturn engines weren't replaced by Orions until March 1979. The smaller Orion engined version (1.2 L A141V) continued to be available in Greece and Kenya into the eighties. Wagon versions for export received updates on the same schedule as did export sedans/coup√©s. The domestic market vans received yet another update in October 1981, again to clean emissions, meaning that a new set of chassis numbers were assigned. The home market vans were available in Standard (only 1200), EL, and GL trim levels. The Lancer Van was finally replaced by the new front-wheel drive Mirage/Lancer Wagon and Van in February 1985. File:Mitsubishi Lancer estate branded locally as Colt Lancer estate first reg January 1979 1439cc.JPG1979 Mitsubishi Lancer Estate (Van) File:1983 Mitsubishi Lancer Wagon.jpg1983 Lancer Van/Wagon Celeste In February 1975, the Lancer was complemented by a hatchback coup√© called the Mitsubishi Lancer Celeste (A70-series). It succeeded the Galant FTO, which never did very well in the marketplace due to confusion with the Galant GTO and carrying too high a price. It was also called the Mitsubishi Celeste or Colt Celeste in some markets; and sold as the Chrysler Lancer Hatchback in Australia, the Dodge Lancer Celeste in El Salvador, the Plymouth Arrow in the United States, and the Dodge Arrow in Canada. Sitting on the same 2,340 mm wheelbase as the Lancer, length was up to 4,115 mm.CG Car Archives '70s, p.80 The Celeste was originally available with 1.4- and 1.6-litre options, a bigger 2.0-litre model was added later. The 1979‚Äì80 Plymouth Fire Arrow came with an even larger (2,555 cc) four-cylinder, but strangled by American emissions regulations it only offered , no more than the Japanese market 2000 GT. Along with receiving a light facelift in July 1977, including new taillights and the cleaner (but lower powered) MCA-Jet engines, new model codes (A140-series) were introduced. There was another facelift in April 1978; square headlights and bigger, less integrated bumpers heralded the coming eighties. Named accordingly, a top-of- the-line GT System 80 version had appeared in November 1977, including every possible extra and special black and gold paintwork. This was trumped by the 2000 GT introduced in June 1979, with a version of the 2-litre Astron engine already used in export since October 1975. Production of the Lancer Celeste ended in July 1981 and it was replaced by the front-wheel drive Cordia in early 1982. Because of the Arrow's long, narrow, aerodynamic, lightweight design and rugged suspension, it was used extensively in various types of racing including SCCA road racing, rally and drag racing. The Arrow body design was used on pro stock and funny cars in the late 1970s by noteworthy racers such as Ray Godman, Don Prudhomme, Bob Glidden and Raymond Beadle. Australia Facelifted 1980 Chrysler Lancer (LC; Australia) The 1.6-liter Celeste was sold in Australia as the Chrysler Lancer Hatchback as part of the LB series from April 1977. It featured sports instrumentation and a version of the 4G32.Chrysler Lancer owner's manual (Australia; 1980) The final LC iteration arrived in May 1979 with a rationalised model range which saw the sedan body variant deleted. Changes were as for 1979 Celestes, comprising rectangular headlamps, redesigned tail-lamps, black painted metal bumpers,Chrysler Australia product information sheet (1979) a new five-speed manual transmission, and a belt driven SOHC version of the 4G32 engine called the G32B. During 1981, the Chrysler was rebranded Mitsubishi Lancer in the Australian market, lasting until August the same year. Some of the Australian cars featured had \\"arrow\\" decals on the hood and stripes on the flanks, depending on the body colour. These were less flamboyant than on those sold in the North American market. North America Dodge Arrow GS (Canada) Chrysler introduced the Plymouth Arrow as a captive import of the Celeste in January 1976 as an extension to the Dodge Colt lineup.Flammang, James. Standard Catalog of Imported Cars, p. 502 It was also known as the Dodge Arrow in Canada. It was also sold as the Dodge Celeste in Puerto Rico. The Arrow was a rear-wheel drive car utilizing a solid rear axle and leaf springs in the rear, with MacPherson struts in the front. Transmission types included four and five-speed manual transmissions and a three-speed automatic. A 1.6 L inline-four engine was standard with an optional 2.0 L I4. It was produced in various trim levels including the 160, GS and GT. The first year Arrow is easily identified from later years because its quarter-window louvers have two slats in the center, which were changed to three on all later years. The 1976 Arrow also came with a single windshield-wiper fluid nozzle on the hood, which was changed to dual nozzles for 1977 and remained that way for all later year Arrows. Sporty exterior finishes were also offered, such as the Arrow Jet package, first offered in 1978. The Arrow Jet paint package was an eye- catching two-tone finish, typically in spit-fire orange and black. The entire car was spit-fire orange, but the entire bottom half of the car was covered in a solid flat black stripe with the words \\"Arrow Jet\\" stenciled out of the stripe on the doors so that the underlying body color showed through. This color combination of spit-fire orange and flat black seems to pay tribute to one of the design inspirations for the Plymouth Arrow, that being the Plymouth Barracuda. In 1971, the Barracuda was offered with a \\"billboard\\" decal option, which was a large, solid flat black decal that covered the entire back half of the car on both sides (often in a red and flat black color combination). Dodge Arrow GS (Canada) For 1979, the styling was freshened with the addition of flush bumpers, a more horizontal grille with rectangular headlights and hidden turn signals, chrome strips on the tail-lamps, and larger rear glass for the hatchback. Inside, the steering wheel previously found only in the Arrow GT was now standard while the heater provided more output. The rear axle was also extended 2.5 inches for better traction. A sporty variant called the Fire Arrow was first offered this year, which had special decals and a sporty interior, as well as a 2.6 L I4 engine and four-wheel disc brakes. The Fire Arrow had one of the best horsepower/weight ratios among U.S. production cars at the time because of its light weight. The 2.6 was also optional on the GS and GT models, and was only offered in conjunction with disc brakes all around. For 1979 and the succeeding year, the lineup began with the base Arrow (where the 2.0 L I4 engine was a new engine option), followed by the GS, GT, and the Fire Arrow on top. The styling changes of the 1979 models carried over to 1980. The Fire Arrow however, was changed significantly. The 1980 Fire Arrow was now available with two new paint schemes: tan with a darker caramel- colored hood, and blue with a dark blue hood. These colored models were available with the smaller 1.6 engine and, like the base-model Arrows, had bumpers that were chrome instead of body color. The white Fire Arrow was also changed, and now had a matte-black hood and cowl, with the black paint continuing along the tops of the fenders and doors and ending under the quarter-windows. Unlike the colored versions, the white/black Fire Arrow had only one engine option, the 2.6 I4. The Arrow was discontinued after the 1980 model-year and was replaced by the Plymouth Sapporo/Dodge Challenger which was larger, heavier and had more amenities. The Sapporo/Challenger retained rear- wheel drive and was itself the forerunner to the Mitsubishi Starion. A pickup version of the Arrow was released in 1979 which was also available with the 2.6 L engine, but they shared few, if any parts. The Arrow's styling influence can clearly be seen in the Plymouth Arrow Truck and its cousins; the Dodge D-50 and Mitsubishi Mighty Max pickups. The Harry Nilsson song, Me and My Arrow (from The Point!) was used in television commercials in the United States promoting the Plymouth Arrow during the 1970s. One of the more interesting options available for the Arrow was a small tent. When the rear seats were lowered and the tent was clipped over the open hatchback, it would allow the back of the car to be used for camping. General Motors would borrow this design many years later for the Pontiac Aztek. Specifications and timeline Data tables expand. Models listed are primarily as available in the Japanese domestic market, with notes on important export variants. For information on the Lancer-based Dodge Colt see that article.

Psychology  In a psychological context it is used as a technique in brainwashing and abuse to disorient and disarm the victim. For example, in the context of workplace bullying, destabilisation applied to the victim may involve: * failure to acknowledge good work and value the victim's efforts * allocation of meaningless tasks * removal of areas of responsibility without consultation * repeated reminders of blunders * setting up to fail * shifting of goal posts without telling the victim * persistent attempts to demoralise the victim. Destabilisation could also denote the extreme end of disinhibition syndrome and entail the complete shutdown of an individual's control of emotions, inhibitions, and productive functioning. The condition can be episodic or it could last for months or years, requiring professional care from a practitioner who is familiar with the individual's primary neurological disorder. In psychology, there is also a process called cognitive destabilisation, which involves being open to conversions and transformations of various kinds. This could be used to counter political destabilisation by presenting a consensual view of the problem.  Other applications  Destabilisation is also used in the feminist context such as the way it is used to change the binary opposition between men and women, particularly how it gives the category 'woman' its meaning. For instance, this is expressed in many feminists' discomfort concerning postmodern theories' challenge to traditional binary oppositions, perceiving it as a subversion of women's attempt to define their own subjecthood. The body of literature on feminism also often invoke the need to destabilise modern theory, particularly the theoretical discourses that claim neutrality but are established from a masculine perspective. These attempts to destabilise modern female constructs have been informed by Jacques Derrida's deconstruction theory, particularly the destabilisation of positions and subjects that have been deemed holistic or authoritative. In literature, a conceptualization refers to it as an aggression or a kind of attack on the reader to provoke discomfort. In international capital transactions, it is used to denote as a capital movement driven by erroneous forecast, driving the exchange rate away from equilibrium that would be supported by rational speculators whose foresight are correct.

Aims # To provide a forum for family history and genealogical groups and societies which share an interest in Irish research. # To encourage, foster and promote greater public knowledge of and access to records relevant to genealogists, whether held by Civil, Ecclesiastical, or private bodies. # To formulate, influence and co-ordinate policy on all issues of concern to member organisations. # To encourage membership of CIGO by both Irish and overseas genealogical and family history organisations. Work Since CIGO was established it has lobbied for change on numerous issues. Its work to improve civil registration practices in Ireland brought about the first change in data recorded in death registrations since civil registration of deaths first began in Ireland in 1864.#http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2004/a304#pdf Civil Registration Act 2004. Through its lobbying,http://www#cigo#ie/IrishTimes2004#html since December 2005 Irish death registrations now note each deceased person's date and place of birth and both parents' names. After its executive liaison officers appeared before the Northern Ireland Assembly's Finance & Personnel Scrutiny Committee in early 2009 the General Register Office for Northern Ireland (GRONI) accepted the committee's findings (noted in its report) that similar changes should be adopted in Northern Ireland death registrations. Subsequently, the changes came into force on Monday, 17 December 2012.#http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/finance/2007mandate/reports/report_01_08_09r.htm Report on the Civil Registration Bill (NIA 20/07)# Since its inception CIGO has campaigned for the early release of the Irish 1926 census returns. Through its work CIGO was successful in getting provision for general release of census records in Ireland after only 70 years included in an early amendment during the Bill stages of the Statistics Act 1993. However, this was later increased to an embargo of 100 years before the Act was passed.# 1926 Census# In 2011, with a change of government in Ireland, the new Minister for Heritage, Jimmy Deenihan TD, recognised CIGO's call to open the 1926 census and has since promoted the value such a move would have to genealogy and roots tourism. Through use of the UK's Freedom of Information Act, in 2010 CIGO was able to secure public access to England & Wales' wartime National Register. A quasi-census, the National Register lists by address every person residing in England & Wales on the night of 29 September 1939, along with their date of birth. Following this, in 2009 the NHSIC opened a service providing information from the National Register on payment of a fee. This had a domino effect and very shortly after access was provided to the National Register in both Scotland and in Northern Ireland. Membership Full membership of CIGO is open to all Family History Societies (and similar organisations) based on the island of Ireland and Associate membership is open to all similar groups based outside Ireland.

Built about 1720, it is believed to be the oldest surviving colonial building in the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, and now houses professional offices. Description and history The Jonathan Root House is located north of the village center of Southington, on the west side of North Main Street at its junction with Mill Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a large central chimney and a center entrance. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a gabled entablature. It originally had a more steeply sloping rear roof, giving it a saltbox profile, but that was raised in the 20th century to provide for a larger second story. Well- preserved interior elements include a period builtin cupboard. The house's exact construction date is not known, but it was the residence of Jonathan Root, a prominent 18th century resident, and is estimated to have been built around 1720. The town was first settled in the late 17th century, and Root (born 1707) married into the locally prominent Woodruff family. When Southington was incorporated in 1779, the residents chose Root as one of the five first selectmen. At that same meeting, Root, along with Josiah Cowles, were appointed to a committee to \\"provide for the families of officers and soldiers in the field.\\" In 1774, Root was appointed to a committee to deliver provisions to Boston, in response to the British blockade of Boston harbor. In addition to living here, Root also operated a tavern on the premises.

The earliest princes were said to be Rajputs from Ayodhya, of the same family as those who reigned in Gujrat and Mewar. Hieun Tsang, the Chinese traveller, who visited the Punjab in 630 AD, speaks of a large city, containing many thousands of families, chiefly Brahmans, situated on the eastern frontier of the kingdom of Cheka, which he says, extended from the Indus to the Beas. An 1876 engraving of Chauhan Rajputs of Punjab, from the Illustrated London News The old Hindu- city Ichhra Bazaar (Market) at night. The market, because of being designed in very old style is very narrow for vehicles to cross and shoppers to walk. Many historians agree that Lahore was founded by an ancient Rajput colony sometime between the first and seventh centuries, probably as early as the beginning of the second; that it soon rose to be a place of importance, the parent of other colonies, and eventually the capital of a powerful principality, to which it gave its name. There are some grounds supporting that the old Hindu city of Lahore did not occupy exactly the site of the modern city. Tradition points the site of old Lahore to the vicinity of Ichhra - which is now a part of Lahore city - but was back then a village about three miles to the west. The name of the village was formerly Icchra Lahore . Moreover, some of the oldest and most sacred Hindu shrines are to be met within this locality, namely and the Chandrat. The gate of the present city, known as the Lahori or Lohari Gate was so called as being the gateway looking in the direction of Lohawar or old Lahore just as the Kashmiri Gate looks towards Kashmir, and the Delhi Gate of modern Delhi to the ancient city of that name.Temple wrought with stories by Haroon Khalid There are no architectural remains of the old Hindu city of Lahore, a circumstance which might well be explained by the absence of stone material, and the numerous destructive invasions to which the city has been subjected. But also, in accordance with what all Indian architectural researchers tend to show namely, that the northern Hindu race was not, until a comparatively late period, in the habit of building temples, or durable edifices of any kind. Even at Delhi, the seat of Hindu Dynasties from upwards of a thousand years BCE to more than a thousand years AD (CE) , and there, where is abundance of stone, no specimens of Hindu architecture exist dating earlier than the tenth or eleventh century.An evaluation of Lahore Style of Architecture Invasions At the period of the first Muhammadan invasion, Lahore was in possession of a Chauhan prince, of the family of Ajmer. Whether owing to change of dynasty, or to Lahore's exposed position on the high road from Afghanistan to India, it was subsequently deserted and the seat of the government was removed to Sialkot or its vicinity, where it remained until the period of the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni in the beginning of the eleventh century; that the conqueror re-occupied the deserted city, and established a garrison in a fort, which was built possibly, like the Old Fort at Delhi, on the ruin of the old Rajput stronghold. In 682 AD, according to Ferishta, the Afghans of Kerman and Peshawar, who had, even at that early period, embraced the religion of the Prophet, wrested certain possession from the Hindu prince. A war ensued, and in the space seventy battles were fought with varied success, until the Afghans, having formed an alliance with the Ghakkars, a wild tribe inhabiting the Salt Range of Punjab, compelled the Raja to cede a portion of his territory. The next mention of Lahore is in the Rajputana chronicles, where the Bussas of Lahore, a Rajput tribe, are mentioned as rallying to the defence of Chittore, when besieged by Muslim forces in the beginning of the ninth century. Image of Mahmud in his court where noblemen and noblewomen convened. At length, in 975 AD, Sabaktagin, Governor of Khorassan and father of the celebrated Mahmud advanced beyond the Indus. He was met by Jeipal, the Raja of Lahore whose dominion is said to have extended from Sirhind to Lamghan and from Kashmir to Multan. By the advice of the Bhati tribe, the Raja Jeipal formed an alliance with the Afghans, and, with their aid, was enabled to withstand the first invasion. However, Sabaktagin later repeated his invasion on his succession to the throne of Ghazni. A battle ensued in the vicinity of Lamghan ending with the defeat of the Raja and overtures being made for peace. His terms were accepted and persons were sent, on the part of Sabaktagin, to take the balance of the stipulated ransom. On reaching Lahore, Jeipal proved faithless and imprisoned those commissioned to receive the treasure. On learning intelligence of his perfidy, Sabaktagin, in the words of the Ferishta, \\"like a foaming torrent, hastened towards Hindustan\\". Another battles ensued, in which Jeipal was again vanquished, and he retreated, leaving the territory to the west of the Nilab or Indus in the hands of the invader. The invader did not retain the conquests that he had made for in 1008 AD, a confederation headed by Anangpal, the son of Jeipal, again met the advancing army, now commanded by Mahmud, son and successor of Sabaktagin, in the vicinity of Peshawar. Lahore was allowed to remain intact for thirteen years longer. Anangpal was succeeded by Nardjanpal, while Mahmud pushed his conquests into Hindustan. But in 1022 AD, he suddenly marched down from Kashmir, seized Lahore without opposition, and gave it over to be plundered. Nardjanpal fled helpless to Ajmer, and the Hindu principality of Lahore was extinguished forever. A final effort was made by the Hindus in the reign of Modud, 1045 AD, to recover their lost sovereignty, but after a fruitless siege of six months, they retired without success.

The last of the big capacity unit- construction singles from the Birmingham Small Arms company, it had an alloy engine with a bore of and a stroke of . As well as the road version, special models were produced for off-road competition use. Development BSA's earlier 500cc single was the BSA Gold Star, a pre-unit machine with a duplex frame similar to that of the Golden Flash twin. The Gold Star was not considered suitable for the progression to unit construction. The name was revived when the 250 cc BSA C15/Starfire was eventually developed into the 500 cc B50 (via the B40 & B44). The dry sump B50 included features such as \\"oil in the frame\\" and the electrics in a single removable 'pod'. BSA kept production costs down by using parts across a range of models, launched in 1971. About 5,700 were built. Some B50s were modified for off-road use by specialist builders such as Eric Cheney. Racing success B50 bikes were successful in both road-racing and off-road events. A modestly modified B50 Gold Star 500 entered by Mead & Tomkinson of Hereford, England and ridden by Nigel Rollason and Clive Brown won the 500cc class in both the Thruxton 500 miler and the Barcelona 24 hours ( at the Montju√Øc circuit), and won the Zolder 24-hour race outright. Also, a B50 fielded by Mead & Tomkinson once held the class lap record in the Production Isle of Man TT. After the demise of BSA, Alan Clews bought up remaining B50 part stocks and set up Clews Competition Motorcycles, producing successful CCM motocross bikes based on the B50. B50SS (Gold Star) The BSA B50SS 'street scrambler' Gold Star was designed for road use and was partly aimed at the US market and proved its credentials by winning the 500cc class in the Thruxton 500 miler and the Barcelona 24-hour endurance race. B50T (Victor Trail) Trail version The B50T was specifically designed with the fast-growing trail riding boom in mind in the US, with the bike using many parts common to both the SS and MX versions. B50MX (Moto Cross) The B50MX was designed for off-road competition and produced between 1971 and 1973. The very last MX's produced were therefore coming off the production line after the demise of BSA and were 'badged' as the Triumph TR5MX. Triumph TR5T Trophy Trail/Adventurer In an attempt to make new models from existing BSA/Triumph parts, a Triumph T100C engine was fitted into modified B50 cycle parts. Launched in late 1972 (1973 model year), the new model was called the Triumph Adventurer in the UK and the Trophy Trail in the US, where most of the machines were sold on the East Coast. The model used Lucas electrics, Nippon Denso Speedo and rev counter and handlebar switches from Yamaha. Production continued into 1974, after which the model was dropped. A British team finished second in the 1973 IDST on these machines. Norton P92 As part of an attempt to produce new models from existing parts, NVT produced a few prototype P92 models. This model comprised a B50 engine in a BSA Fury/Triumph Bandit frame using Isolastic mountings from the Norton Commando. The US DOT had mandated that all motorcycles sold in the US should have a left hand gear change. The B50 had the gear lever on the right, so to comply with this requirement, the engine was tilted forward in the frame and a gear linkage run under the gearbox to provide a left hand gear change. The model never progressed to production. B100 V-Twin (with two B50 cylinders ) Specialist motorcycle designer Gerald Fitzpatrick created a 1000 cc BSA V-twin using parts from two B50 engines in 1977. The frame was a slimline featherbed Norton Atlas. Triumph considered putting the B100 into production but were not able to finance re-tooling costs. The B100 prototype was ridden for two years and has been stored since but was featured in the magazine British Bike Mechanics in April 1978 and January 1988.

Frederick Casimir was the son of Jacob Kettler and Louise Charlotte of Brandenburg. In his reign the Duchy lost its geopolitical position and became Sweden, Prussia and Russia's territorial subject of interests.  Biography  Frederick Casimir Kettler studied law in Germany and visited a number of European courts. In 1673 he was in the Dutch military service and took part with his Courland regiment in the Franco-Dutch War. On 5 October 1675, in the Hague, Frederick Casimir married princess Sophie Amalie of Nassau-Siegen and returned home. After his father died Frederick Casimir became the Duke of Courland and Semigallia and vigorously resorted to public affairs. In 1684 the duke's book printer George Radeckis in Jelgava became the first person to print books in the Latvian language. His efforts to restore the holdings were stopped by the power of Sweden, which at that time prevailed in northern Europe. However, Friedrich Casimir founded splendid court life according to the best Western models. In 1688 Sophie Amalie died. In 1691 Frederick Casimir celebrated a large-scale wedding with Elisabeth Sophie of Brandenburg. During the reign of Frederick Casimir, trade and industry of the duchy started to decay. In 1693 the Tobago colony was sold to England. In the spring of 1697, Friedrich Casimir received a grand delegation from Russia, including the new Tsar Peter I, on whom the Jelgava Palace and its court left a great impression. The duchy and Russia held diplomatic talks on mutual cooperation against the Swedes, but in the next winter of 1698, Frederick Casimir died at the age of 47.

He worked as a curator at the Stuttgarter Naturaliensammlung and discovered the dinosaurs of the Tendaguru formation in then German East Africa (now Tanzania). The dinosaur Efraasia is named after him.  Life  Eberhard Fraas was born in Stuttgart, the son of Oscar Fraas (1824-1897), a curator and professor at the geological and paleontological department of the W√ºrttemberg Royal Natural Cabinet. After attending the Gymnasium, he studied at Leipzig University with Hermann Credner and Ferdinand Zirkel, and later in Munich under Karl Alfred von Zittel, August Rothpletz (1853‚àí1918) and Paul Groth. Here, he received his Ph.D in 1886 with a dissertation about Jurassic starfish. His geological work enabled him to publish the first coherent account about the history of the Alps. In July 1888, he received his Habilitation (second Ph.D.) from Munich University, and in 1891 became an assistant at the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart. In 1894, he became curator of its geological, paleontological and mineralogical departments. In that capacity, he was responsible for a multitude of geological maps of his native Swabia. Many of these were published in co-operation with Wilhelm Branco (who would later change his name to Wilhelm von Branca). Fraas was also curator of Friedrich Alfred Krupp's mineral collections, and taught him from 1898 to his death in 1902. Trips to Spain, Sardinia, Italy, the Balkans, the west of North America (1901), Egypt and Syria (1897 and 1906) and finally to German East Africa (1907) broadened his view and filled the museum with new acquisitions. His discovery of dinosaurs in East Africa would spawn many expeditions to the Tendaguru, first by the Berlin Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, and by British institutions once the Germans had lost control of the colony after World War I. Fraas died unexpectedly on March 6, 1915, in Stuttgart, from dysentery which he had caught while in East Africa.

Much of the church has not changed since the medieval era. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 1 April 1980 and was vested in the Trust on 28 October 1981. The church is just above the surrounding water meadows next to the confluence of the River Thames, River Coln and the Thames and Severn Canal. St John's was a particular favourite of John Betjeman an English poet, writer and broadcaster who was a founding member of the Victorian Society and Poets Laureate. Richard Taylor presenter of BBC Four's Churches: How To Read Them picked Inglesham as his favourite of the hundreds of churches he visited for the television programme, saying \\"It was a totally unassuming building, sat in the middle of the countryside. But, despite its humble appearance, inside, this church told the story of over 1,000 years of religious history ‚Äì from Anglo-Saxon carvings on one wall, to medieval wall paintings on another and then passages from the Bible etched elsewhere from the Reformation.\\" The programme also presented resistance by a local artist, William Morris, a founder of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings against Victorian redevelopment as a story of local campaigning in the 1880s. Much of the fabric of the building is from the 13th century, but includes remains of an earlier church on the site. The interior includes wall paintings spanning over 600 years and often one on top of the other up to seven layers thick. There is also a carving of the Mother and Child which dates from the Anglo-Saxon era. Until 1910 the carving was on the outside of the church attached to the south wall and used as a sundial. There are also historic box pews, pulpit and memorials. History In 1205 King John gave the church to the Cistercian monks of Beaulieu Abbey. In 1231 Pope Gregory IX granted a licence, appropriating the church at Inglesham, amongst others, to the abbey of Beaulieu at the request of Henry III. In 1355 the manors of Inglesham was granted a hospital in honour of the Annunciation of St. Mary, Newark. In the 1880s a major restoration of the church was planned. William Morris, an English textile designer, artist, writer, and socialist associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the English Arts and Crafts Movement, who lived away at Kelmscott in Oxfordshire, campaigned to save the building without unsympathetic alterations. This resulted not just in support but also and unusually a fund-raising campaign by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB). The Society was established in 1877 and its manifesto, which Morris wrote, set out its principles ‚Äòto stave off decay by daily care ‚Ä¶ and otherwise to resist all tampering with either the fabric or ornament of the building as it stands‚Äô. They employed J.T. Micklethwaite to oversee the work during 1888 and 1889. Oswald Birchall undertook a survey of the church which enabled Morris and John Henry Middleton to prepare a report for SPAB in 1885 suggesting the repairs be funded as the rector George Woodbury Spooner said that it was beyond the means of the parishioners. Further restoration by Percival Hartland Thomas was carried out in 1933 to replace the remains of the reredos from around 1330 in the chancel. The church was declared redundant in 1979 and vested in the Redundant Churches Fund (which has since become the Churches Conservation Trust) in 1981. Architecture The small church has no tower, but does have a 13th-century double bellcote, with pointed trefoiled lights, on the west gable of the nave. It contains two bells dated 1717, which were made by Abraham Rudhall, the founder of Rudhall of Gloucester. The masonry is limewashed, and surmounted by a parapet and head spouts. The walls are thick and high. The church has a aisled nave and an aisleless chancel. The chancel replaced a previous one which was square and has a roof which includes tie beams which may date back to the 13th century. The nave has mediaeval queen post and wind brace roof, which is supported by two responds and a central pier. The 15th-century cross outside the church has three steps to a high plinth with a pyramid stop- chamfer surmounted by a tall shaft with pyramid stop-chamfer and crested capping. It is listed at Grade II*. Interior Anglo-Saxon carving of the Mother and Child was previously a sundial on the outside of the church. The interior of the church contains wall paintings dating from the 13th to the early 19th centuries, some of which are illustrated in Professor E. W. Tristram's English Wall Painting of the Fourteenth Century.Tristram, 1955, page 11 Tristram notes that fragments of a reredos survive with paintings of four saints on them,Tristram, 1955, page 63 and he also comments on \\"crosses of rather elaborate design\\".Tristram, 1955, page 29 Some wall paintings are on crumbling plaster behind painted post-Reformation texts, in places the paint is up to seven layers thick. There are 15th-century angels above the chancel arch and an early 14th-century Doom on the east wall of the north aisle. Victorian texts include the Ten commandments, the Apostles' Creed and the Lord's Prayer. Restoration work on the paintings in 2010 led to access to the church being restricted. There is a carving of the Mother and Child in the south wall which dates from the time of the Anglo-Saxons. Until 1910, the carving was on the outside of the church attached to the south wall and used as a sundial. An incised meridian and other lines were added along with a hole for the gnomon of a scratch dial. Its original position in the church is not known, but may have been above the altar. There are also parclose screens between the Carolean-style box pews that date from the Commonwealth era and a hanging pyx. The font is from the 15th century while the Jacobean pulpit and tester are from around 1630. There is a Tournai marble slab with a knight in the chancel which dates from around 1300. The piscina is from the 13th century with a trefoiled head, a shelf and a circular basin. On the floor of the chancel is a black marble slab that once held the brass of a 14th-century knight with a basinet, sword and four shields.

It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Latif. The name means \\"servant of the All-gentle\\", Al-Latƒ´f being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which gave rise to the Muslim theophoric names. The surname is used by Muslims and also by Orthodox Christians in Syria and Lebanon. The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by e.

Geography Toland has a mailing address of Gardners, Pennsylvania, because the size of the community doesn't warrant a post office, nor a census designated place name. The very small village, less than long, is located on Pine Grove Road, east of Mountain Creek Campground. The closest town is Mount Holly Springs located to the north, where most residents drive to for supplies. The village is roughly south of Carlisle and north of Gettysburg; and southeast of Boiling Springs. History Toland was built for the clay bank company workers in the first quarter of the 20th century. The original community of Toland consisted of 11 duplex houses, built side by side along Pine Grove Road, with less than 0.17 of an acre of land to each. Additional homes have been built since. When the community was originally built there was only a common well with a hand pump for all of the families to draw from. What is now a sand pit operation was originally a clay bank mining operation that was the reason for the location of the village of Toland. Features The Michaux State Forest surrounds the village. Pine Grove Furnace State Park, Laurel Lake, and Fuller Lake are located a few miles to the west, near the intersection of Pine Grove Road and Pennsylvania Route 233. It is located less than from the Pine Grove Road crossing of the Appalachian Trail. The only business in Toland is the Cherokee Campground, formerly known as the Tagg Run Campground. The campground's Tagg Run restaurant has closed. Toland Mission is a small non-denominational church that can hold up to 74 persons. It was originally built in Carlisle, by the owner of Beetem Lumber Company, for the families of the community of Toland. A one-room school house near the church originally served the community, but it was converted to a home when residents' children were transported to a township school.

The shrine is dedicated to Amaterasu. The shrine was founded on April 20, 2000 and serves to pray for the safe passage of all boats through the Senkaku Islands and the East China Sea. Construction was led by Nihon Seinensha, a right-wing organization affiliated with the Sumiyoshi-kai, and wooden hokora were also constructed. When the shrine was founded, it was the first time since the end of World War II that a kannushi had been on the island. Every year, the two lighthouses built by Seinensha on the island are inspected and serviced, and during this time a yearly festival occurs, and prayers are issued for safe passage. In 2006, Seinensha donated the lighthouses to the government and they are now a national property administered by the Japan Coast Guard. In March 2004, several Chinese activists illegally landed on the island. Seinensha reported the incident to the Okinawa Police, who arrested the activists and made a damage report. Afterwards, Seinensha rebuilt the hokora and erected a plinth with the words \\"Senkaku Jinja\\" written on it. The hokora and plinth are built of solid granite.

Vallibona () is a small town and municipality located in the Ports comarca, province of Castell√≥, part of the autonomous community of Valencia, Spain. According to the 2009 census, it has a total population of 90 inhabitants. It is located in the upper valley of the C√©rvol River, between the Serra del Turmell and the Ports de Beseit mountain ranges, in a very lonely area, relatively far from other towns. Vallibona is part of the Taula del S√©nia free association of municipalities. Vallibona has a special relationship with the town of Pena- roja (Pe√±arroya de Tastavins) over the hills in Matarranya. It has been recorded that festivities have been celebrated together with that town at least since the 14th century.Rogativa de Vallibona a Pena-Roja de Tastavins Sant Dom√®nec de Vallibona is a small settlement with a church founded in 1237 located 12 km to the east, close to the road leading to Rossell.Vallibona Vallibona is the birthplace of La Pastora, nickname of Florencio Pla Meseguer, also known as Teresa (1917 - 2004), a transvestite Spanish Maquis who used to disguise as a female and who operated in the Maestrat area until the early 1960s.Jose Calvo Segarra, La pastora. Del monte al mito, ed. by Odette Calvo This municipality should not be confused with Vallivana, a small settlement depending from Morella further SW. History Vallibona was a Muslim town until nearby Morella was conquered by James I of Aragon in the 13th century. The town has lost much population in the last 100 years; it had 1,808 inhabitants in 1900 and 1,133 in 1950. After General Franco's Plan de Estabilizaci√≥n in 1959 the population declined steeply as people emigrated towards the industrial areas of Barcelona and coastal Castell√≥ Province. Other causes of the strong emigration have been the abandonment of traditional agricultural practices by the local youth, such as sheep and goat rearing, as well as the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century. By 1994 Vallibona had only a residual population of 104 inhabitants, mostly in their old age. Nowadays the town derives some income from rural tourism. Vallibona revives during the summer season when many former residents return to the town to spend the holidays.

Players may access locked game content by upgrading to a premium account for a one-time fee. Gameplay As is typical with online, fantasy games, play is initiated by creating a basic character profile, which includes choosing a name, gender and base class (mage, rogue or warrior). The game is then played exclusively through point and click commands to navigate the player character across the play area, to interact with non-player characters (NPCs), to engage in combat, to progress the storyline, etc. While in a battle sequence, the character may be assisted by NPCs that have joined his/her party or by pets that have been activated. The player may also switch among a collection of weapons and equipable items, which are generally chosen based upon the items' respective core element (e.g., water, wind, fire, stone, etc.). The battles are turn-based, giving the player an indefinite amount of time to choose from an assortment of actions, either offensive, defensive, healing or a combination thereof. The character's available actions are determined by the character's class and \\"armor\\" (e.g., ninja, pirate, ranger, etc.), with new armors being introduced on a regular basis. In general, battles occur within \\"Quests\\" that contribute to the overarching storyline and typically features a \\"boss\\" character, which will be a particularly powerful NPC or monster, often having a small dialogue with the player pre-fight (and sometimes post-fight). Defeating enemies throughout a quest earns the character gold and experience points, the latter contributing to the character moving up in skill level when enough experience has been earned. Weapons and other items are \\"dropped\\" when the quest's boss has been defeated. While new quests and story elements are added on a near-weekly basis, the previously- developed story elements remain playable both to new and to seasoned players, with most enemies' skill levels increasing (i.e. scaling) along with the character's level. Plot In \\"Book 1\\" the character is introduced into the story as a hero from an unknown location arriving to Lore (the world of DragonFable), destined to become a Dragon Lord who will own one of the two great dragons, unhatched in separate boxes (black and white) at the start of the game. Obtaining the dragon egg (ironically) from the Black Dragon Box is one of the two major story lines in Book 1 and of the rest of the game. The storyline throughout Book 1 revolves around a primary antagonist named \\"sepulchure,\\" who is a \\"Doom Knight\\" possessing the White Dragon Box on a mission to capture all the \\"Elemental Orbs\\" as a means to achieve ultimate power and world domination. In addition to the series of Elemental Orb story arcs, there are many intertwining subplots in Book 1, creating a rich world full of creative and often comical discoveries. Temporary seasonal quest chains also appear during real-world holiday seasons (see more details below), which occasionally tie into the main plot line, sometimes in major ways. In \\"Book 2\\" the character assists a group of aliens that has escaped to Lore from an inter-dimensional creature called \\"Wargoth.\\" The character also joins in a search, throughout the ever-expanding world of Lore, for the NPC \\"Warlic\\" after his disappearance at the end of Book 1. In \\"Book 3\\" the character awakens to a vastly-expanded Lore, after being encased in ice for five years, to engage, sometimes collaboratively but usually combatively, with the anti- magic movement called \\"The Rose,\\" which has become a major power. Side quests On 19 February 2010, the ArchKnight game and quest chain was continued and completed within DragonFable, with \\"Ash\\" (normally an NPC) as the player character. This quest chain is only accessible to those with premium accounts either in AdventureQuest or in DragonFable. In 2012, the Alexander quest chain, which follows the young mage \\"Alexander\\" during his training, was released; it explains the origins of the characters \\"Warlic,\\" \\"Xan,\\" and \\"Jaania,\\" all of whom are integral to the main storyline. In- game events DragonFable has several recurring holiday events. These include Valentine's Day (named \\"Hero's Heart Day\\" in game), April Fools' Day (a random in-game prank, such as switching DragonFable's NPCs with NPCs from MechQuest), Halloween (named \\"Mogloween\\" in game), Christmas (named \\"Frostval\\" in game), Friday the 13th, Talk Like a Pirate Day and Thanksgiving (named \\"Thankstaking\\" in game). They also have occasional hunts, like gourd, egg and chest hunting. George Lowe, a voice actor best known for his role as Space Ghost in Space Ghost Coast to Coast, voiced himself in a live event known as \\"Falconreach Idle\\" on 19 November 2010. Reception A few months after its live release in 2006, Chris Barylick, from The Mac Observer, while acknowledging an instant obsession with this \\"cool Flash-based role playing game,\\" reported that DragonFable was \\"not perfect, nor does it offer the same options as the marquee titles [e.g., World of Warcraft, Neverwinter Nights, etc.], but it's definitely worth a gander.\\" Andre Haas, from About.com, said that the game was \\"highly recommended to fans of Adventure Quest...Dragon Fable is pretty much just an improved version of Adventure Quest.\\" Also within a few months of its live release, Andrew Wooldridge, from Jay Is Games (JiG) concluded, \\"If you are looking for a hard core RPG you might look elsewhere.

Originally chartered as the Knoxville Female Academy, the school offered high school and college-level courses to the women of Knoxville and surrounding counties in the years before the University of Tennessee became coeducational. With the rise of free public education in Knoxville in the early 1900s, the institute, which was tuition- based, gradually declined.Laura Luttrell, \\"One Hundred Years of a Female Academy: The Knoxville Female Academy, 1811-1846; The East Tennessee Female Institute, 1846-1911.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, No. 17 (1945), pp. 71-83. History=Knoxville Female Academy Blount College, the forerunner of the University of Tennessee, was chartered in 1794, and was originally open to both males and females. By the time it was rechartered as East Tennessee College in 1807, however, it was an all-male institution, and Knoxville's leaders began making preparations to establish a school for the city's young women. The Knoxville Female Academy was chartered in 1811, but its trustees struggled for several years to raise enough money to hire faculty and rent a building in which to conduct classes. In 1826, East Tennessee College made a much-publicized move to a permanent location atop Barbara Hill, and interest in the Knoxville Female Academy was reinvigorated. In April of the following year, the Knoxville Register called on the city's leaders to revive the academy, and by the end of the month the school's trustees had hired faculty (a principal and two instructors) and had made arrangements to hold classes in the home of physician and trustee Joseph Strong. The Reverend John Davis was named the first principal, and classes began on May 7, 1827. In 1828, the school's trustees began raising funds for a permanent school building. Strong and Matthew McClung each donated their halves of the lot bounded by what is now Henley, Main, and Hill Avenue, while Charles McClung, John Crozier, and several lesser donors contributed money for the building, which was completed in 1829. After Davis resigned, Strong secured the services of Dartmouth graduate Joseph Estabrook, who led the academy until 1834 when he resigned to become president of East Tennessee College. The Knoxville Female Academy graduated its first class on September 30, 1831. East Tennessee Female Institute 1872 ad for the East Tennessee Female Institute In 1841, the Methodist Episcopal Church took over patronage of the academy, and the Reverend David McAnally was installed as principal. McAnally helped to greatly increase the school's collections, and the school continued to grow under his leadership. On January 31, 1846, the Knoxville Female Academy was rechartered as the East Tennessee Female Institute, which had the power to confer degrees. Around the same time, the school's trustees began squabbling with the church's representatives, and the board voted to sever ties with the church in 1847. During the 1850s, two East Tennessee College faculty-- George Cooke and R. L. Kirkpatrick-- served as principals of the East Tennessee Female Institute. The latter became principal in 1856, and endeavored to keep the institute open amidst the American Civil War in the early 1860s. The Union Army closed the school in late 1863 and used the school building as a hospital. The school reopened in 1866, and operated under various superintendents until 1877, when the building was leased to Knoxville for use as a public school. In 1885, women's suffragist Lizzie Crozier French and her sister, Lucy, leased the building and reopened the East Tennessee Female Institute. Along with classical subjects, Crozier-French stressed public speaking, and published a text, A Manual of Elocution, for her students. During this period, the Ossoli Circle, a women's club founded by Crozier-French in 1885, held its initial meetings at the institute. The Crozier sisters operated the school until 1890, when the trustees voted to sell the property. Later years In 1892, the East Tennessee Female Institute, which had been renamed the East Tennessee Institute and School of Music, began classes in a new building on Main Street. Under the leadership of Professor Charles Ross and a new faculty, the school's enrollment grew to over 100 by 1894. William Rule's Standard History of Knoxville, published in 1900, described the school as having \\"large, well lighted and ventilated\\" rooms that were \\"well supplied with apparatus, books and maps for teaching languages, sciences, art and history.\\"John Wooldridge, George Mellen, William Rule (ed.), Standard History of Knoxville, Tennessee (General Books, 2009), p. 391. With the rise of free public education in Knoxville in the late 19th century, the institute had difficulty attracting students willing to pay tuition. In 1911, the school closed, and its building was leased to the University of Tennessee Home Economics Department. In 1919, the school's trustees made a deed of gift of the building to UT, which for several years used the building for its College of Law. Curriculum For most of its history, the East Tennessee Female Institute offered a mix of classical studies and \\"ornamental\\" studies. During Estabrook's tenure in the 1830s, first-year students learned spelling, reading, geography, and arithmetic. These subjects were continued in the second year, with grammar and mythology added. Third-year students studied history, natural philosophy, rhetoric and botany, while senior students studied astronomy, chemistry, philosophy, and logic. Ornamental subjects included music (mainly piano), painting, drawing, lace making and sewing. After it was rechartered as the East Tennessee Female Institute in 1846, the school conferred \\"Mistress of Polite Literature\\" degrees upon its graduates. Students were required to give weekly recitations on Biblical Scripture, and bi-weekly recitations on other subjects. Public examinations were given twice per year, and were often attended by members of the public and covered by the city's newspapers.

Biography  The \\"Calle Princesa D√°cil\\" in Las Palmas is named after her. D√°cil or D√°cila was born in the ancient Menceyato (kingdom) of Taoro (Tenerife, Canary Island), during the early second half of the fifteenth century. She was daughter to Mencey (king) Adjona and Caseloria and granddaughter of Bencomo. She had five brothers: Bentor, Ruiman, Rosalva, Chachi√±ama, and Ti√±ate. D√°cil was admired throughout the island for her beauty. She was described as blonde and freckled, with green eyes, like many other aborigines of northern Tenerife.http://www.celtiberia.net/verrespuesta.asp?idp=539. Celtiberia.net v3.0 - que leyenda hay tras el nombre de Dacil. D√°cil was initially intended to marry Duriman el Monta√±es (Duriman of the Mountains). However, with the arrival of the Spanish Captain Fernando Garc√≠a del Castillo, a Castilian officer of a Spanish Cavalry unit, D√°cil gained another suitor. Captain Fernando Garc√≠a del Castillo was taken prisoner and placed under the care of Princess D√°cil so that she could see to the wounds he had suffered in the Battle of Aguere. According to several historians, Captain Fernando Garc√≠a del Castillo acted as a diplomat, providing services between the Guanches and invading Spanish people, and was honored with some estimates by the King of Taoro.https://web.archive.org/web/20110324002749/http://www.webtenerife.com/Sobre- Tenerife/Historia/Los-guanches/PRINCESA+DACIL.htm?Lang=es PRINCESA D√ÅCIL - Los guanches - P√°gina oficial de Turismo de Tenerife (PRINCESS Dacil - The Guanches - Official Website of Tenerife Tourism) (In Spanish) A statue of D√°cil in La Orotava Rumors began to surface that Captain Fernando Garc√≠a del Castillo and Princess D√°cil were lovers. They were believed to have spoken alone‚Äîa practice strictly forbidden by Guanche law. The Guanche, Duriman El Montanez, who was promised D√°cil in marriage felt spurned and further fed accusations of her being alone with a man, who was, in addition, a Castilian, and, therefore, the enemy of the Guanche homeland. Duriman el Monta√±es asked Bencomo to arrest Princess D√°cil (Bencomo's granddaughter). Bencomo complied with the law and imprisoned D√°cil for many months. When she was released, D√°cil was able to convince Bencomo that she had never met Captain Fernando Garc√≠a del Castillo alone; that, in fact, she had many witnesses to attest that she was always accompanied when meeting with the Castillian captain.http://www.tenerifemagazine.com/tag/magic?lang=es. Magia  Tenerife Magazine - Revista de Tenerife s√≥lo en l√≠nea (magic  Magazine Tenerife - Tenerife Magazine Online Only) (In Spanish). She later married the captain in the Iglesia de la Concepci√≥n (Church of the Conception) of Los Realejos. She was baptized as Menc√≠as del Castillo. The date of D√°cil's death and her place of burial are unknown.  Influence on the Canary Islands  * The marriage of D√°cil and Castilian was considered as the bond of brotherhood between the Guanches people and the Spanish people, though the Spanish conquerors and settlers enslaved the Guanches and subjected them to their culture and language in the early sixteenth century. * The poet Antonio de Viana (1578 - 1650?) turned the story of D√°cil into one of his best-known poems in the Canary Island, in his book La Conquista de Tenerife (1604) (The Conquest of Tenerife (1604)). Many people met the princess through the poem and considered him a unique poet. However, as a historian, Bethencourt Alfonso, once said: \\"this princess plays an important role in Viana's poem; a figure that was not imaginary; she was of flesh and blood.\\" * Her name is one of the many Guanche names that, fortunately for the Canary Island, have not been lost, since there are still people named D√°cil throughout the archipelago. * She is also one of the better known historical figures in the archipelago.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1922 to 1931 and from 1935 to 1945.  Early life and family  Charleton was born in Kentish Town, in London. His father Henry Charleton was an engine-driver on the Midland Railway. The younger Henry was educated at Mansfield Place Board School,Dod's Parliamentary Companion, 1943 which he left at age 12. He worked initially as an assistant to a blacksmith, before following his father into the Midland Railway. He rose through the grades and eventually became a driver. In 1897, Charleton married Louisa Jane Alcock from Kentish Town. They had one son.  Career  Whilst working on the railways, Charleton studied at the St Pancras Working Men's College, and became active in the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR). In 1919 he compiled the Locomotive Men's Conditions of Service in 1919, and later became a member of the NUR's executive committee.Hansard, 26 June 1924, vol 175 col. 687 He was elected at the 1922 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leeds South, and held the seat until his defeat in 1931. The formation of the National Government had undermined support for Labour, and in many constituencies the Liberal and Unionist parties fielded a single candidate in support of the National Government. However, Leeds South was contested by the Liberal and Unionists, so Charleton was expected to hold the seat. However the Unionist candidate Noel Whiteside took the seat with a majority of 2.0% of the votes. Described by The Times as a \\"moderate\\", he regained the seat at the 1935 general election, and held it until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1945 general election. He was chairman of the Select Committee on Estimates in 1930, and from 1929 to 1931 he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to William Lunn, the Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. He was a briefly a Junior Lord of the Treasury, in 1931. He also served as an alderman on London County Council.

He only started his professional career at the age of 30, and appeared in 120 Segunda Divisi√≥n matches over four seasons, scoring a combined 38 goals for Alcorc√≥n and Racing de Santander. Club career From 1997 to 2010, Madrid-born Quini played exclusively in the lower leagues of Spanish football, representing nine clubs including CA Pinto (two spells). In the 2009‚Äì10 season he scored 20 goals in 35 matches for CD Legan√©s, also in the Community of Madrid. At the age of already 30, Quini made his second division debut, with AD Alcorc√≥n with which he had already played six years before. He finished the 2010‚Äì11 campaign with 22 goals, fifth-best in the competition as the team easily retained their newly acquired status; highlights included a hat-trick against Girona FC (3‚Äì1 home win) and braces against SD Ponferradina (2‚Äì0, home), Xerez CD (3‚Äì1, home), C√≥rdoba CF (2‚Äì1 at home), UD Las Palmas (5‚Äì0, home) and CD Tenerife (3‚Äì2 home success). Quini lowered his totals to 13 in 2011‚Äì12, but the side again stayed in the second tier, finishing in fourth position and qualifying to the playoffs. He was loaned to Racing de Santander in January 2013, and suffered relegation with the latter. Quini left Alcorc√≥n in the summer of 2014, and moved to CD Eldense in the third level. He retired in January 2015, immediately becoming the latter club's director of football.

A classification system for glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition of numerous different families. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. Because the fold of proteins is better conserved than their sequences, some of the families can be grouped in 'clans'.

History  The Logsdon School of Theology was named for Charles and Koreen Logsdon of Abilene. Mrs. Logsdon made the largest gift in the university‚Äôs history to that date to establish the Logsdon School of Theology in memory of her husband. Construction for the school was completed in 1989 and it is located on the southeastern corner of Hardin-Simmons University's campus. The complex features classrooms, a distance learning and preaching facilities, and the Logsdon Chapel. In 1995, Logsdon School of Theology began offering seminary programs and by 2004 the HSU trustees officially established Logsdon Seminary.Logsdon Seminary - History Hardin-Simmons University publicly experienced financial challenges in the late 2010s continuing into 2020 as the state and the Baptist General Convention of Texas reduced the funding levels of programs in which the university participates. In 2018, the university ended 9 undergraduate and 4 graduate programs and closed 5 campus extensions including Logsdon Seminary campuses in Coppell, Lubbock, Corpus Christi, and McAllen. These changes also included terminations of staff and faculty. Two years later, in 2020, the university announced that it would close Logsdon Seminary and end an additional 22 academic programs with accompanying terminations of staff and faculty.

Construction for the Logsdon School of Theology began in 1988. It is located on the southeastern corner of Hardin-Simmons University‚Äôs campus, just seconds from Interstate 20. The 350-seat chapel space is illuminated by a breathtaking stained-glass window at the front and at the back, l treasure: a Vissar-Rowland Opus 93 pipe organ inscribed with the words: 'Soli Deo Gloria.' Dr. H.K. Neely, Logsdon‚Äôs first dean, consulted with the Byrd Glass Company of Lubbock, Texas to design and construct the Logsdon Chapel stained-glass window. Constructed of 60 individual panels, the 30-by-41 foot wall creates a magnificent kaleidoscope of light. A magnificent piece of Christian art, the window symbolizes the purpose, mission, and vision of Logsdon School of Theology: a cross, an open Bible, and a dove. Centered in the window, the cross signifies the centrality of the living Christ. The open Bible represents the authority of the Bible as the essential and trustworthy guide for life and faith. The dove represents the Holy Spirit‚Äôs presence in the global mission of the church. These elements are encircled, representing the students call to serve the world. The Grace Katherine White Organ, named for Mrs. Katherine Logsdon White, sister of Mr. Charles Logsdon, was constructed in 1992 and likewise warrants a sense of grandiosity.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, the Trust designated St Mary's as its first Conservation Church in 2015. It is the largest church in Shrewsbury. Clifton- Taylor includes the church in his list of 'best' English parish churches. Collegiate Church St Mary's originated as a collegiate church (The Collegiate Church and Royal Free Chapel of St Mary the Virgin, a Royal PeculiarDenton. English Royal Free Chapels p. 122. retrieved 16 April 2014). According to tradition it was founded by King Edgar in the 10th century. By at least the 13th century, it was served by a dean and nine canons. Excavations in 1864 revealed the presence of an earlier church with a nave and an apsidal chancel. Building of the present church began in the 12th century, consisting of a nave without aisles, and a cruciform east end. A large west tower was added, and in about the 1170s the transepts were altered to provide altars for the canons. Construction of the aisles followed, first the south aisle with a porch. Work on the north aisle continued until the 1220s. The crossing was then rebuilt. In the early to mid 13th century the transepts were raised, and the chancel was lengthened and raised. During the 14th century the Trinity Chapel was added to the south of the chancel. In the following century, possibly about 1477 when a bequest was made to the church, further improvements took place, including the construction of a clerestory on the nave and chancel, which replaced the tower at the crossing and the chancel vault. At this time the transept roofs were reduced in height, a large east window was inserted, and larger windows were added to the aisles. It is possible that the spire was added to the west tower at this time. Deans of St. Mary's College, Shrewsbury=Parish Church The church escaped any significant damage during the suppression of the college in 1548, or during the Civil War. The first major restoration was carried out by Thomas Telford in 1788. The east window was enlarged in 1858 by S. Pountney Smith, who also reconstructed some of the roofs between 1864 and 1870. In 1884 Paley and Austin added a vestry to the north of the chancel. Work was performed on the chancel in 1889‚Äì92 by A. E. Lloyd Oswell. The top fell from the spire in 1894, causing much damage to the clerestory, and this was repaired by John Oldrid Scott. The tower underwent a restoration in 1924‚Äì26 by the firm of Lloyd Oswell and Iredale. The church was declared redundant in 1987, and vested in the Churches Conservation Trust.

Architecture=Exterior The plan of the church consists of a four-bay nave, with north and south aisles, and north and south porches, a crossing with north and south transepts, a two-bay chancel with a vestry to the north, the Trinity Chapel to the south, and a west tower. The tower has four stages, the bottom three stages are in red sandstone, and the top stage in white sandstone. The bottom three stages are Norman in style, while the top stage is Perpendicular. In the bottom stage is a west doorway with a round arch of two orders. To the left of the doorway is a re-used Roman stone with a Lewis slot. In the next stage, over the doorway, is a clock face. The third stage contains paired Norman windows, and in the top stage are paired two-light transomed bell openings. The summit of the tower has an embattled pierced parapet, and crocketted pinnacles. There is a stair turret in the northeast corner. The spire is octagonal, and recessed behind the parapet. It carries three tiers of lucarnes. The spire is said to be the third tallest in England. The windows in the north and south sides of the aisles and clerestory are Perpendicular. In the west wall of the south aisle is a round-headed lancet window, and in the west end of the north aisle is a pointed-headed window. The south porch is built in Grinshill stone. It is in two storeys, the lower storey being built in the 12th century, and the upper storey added in the 14th century. The upper storey has a two-light transomed window. The outer doorway has a round arch and three orders of shafts; the inner doorway also has a round arch, but with one order. There are small windows in the side walls of the porch. The south transept has a small Norman doorway and three lancet windows on the south side, and single lancet windows in the west side. The Trinity Chapel has four large three-light windows on the south, and a seven-light window on the east side. The east window of the chancel has eight lights. Above the north vestry are three stepped lancet windows. To the east of the north transept is a \\"complex corner\\" with a variety of windows. The north transept itself has 12th-century pilaster buttresses, a small north doorway, and lancet windows. The north aisle has Perpendicular windows and a porch. Within the porch is another Norman doorway, with one order of shafts. InteriorArcades and furnishings= The nave The choir, organ, pulpit and stained glass windows In the opinion of the architectural historians John Newman and Nikolaus Pevsner, the nave arcades are \\"the finest piece of architecture in the church\\", each consisting of four wide bays, with semicircular arches. The oak ceiling of the nave has 15th-century carvings depicting birds, animals and angels. The Trinity Chapel contains a triple sedilia. The stone mensa of the medieval high altar was excavated in 1870 and placed below the present altar, which shares the same dimensions. The riddel posts and English Altar were erected during the remodeling of the sanctuary by Sir Charles Archibald Nicholson in 1931. The Altar frontals were worked and embroidered by Beatrix Mary Pennyman, wife of the vicar, during the First World War. The octagonal font is Perpendicular, and is carved with arcading and (now headless) angels, The pulpit dates from 1853, it is polygonal, in stone, and designed by S. Poultney Smith. The floor of the church is tiled. The organ case dates from 1729 and was designed by John Harris and John Byfield. The canopied clergy stall of 1897 was designed by C. E. Kempe; it was formerly in the chapel of Shrewsbury School. In 1729 Harris and Byfield built a new three-manual organ to replace an earlier organ. This was rebuilt and enlarged in 1847 by Gray and Davison. The present four-manual organ dates from 1912. There is a ring of ten bells, eight of which were cast in 1775 by Pack and Chapman at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, and the other two in by 1911 by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. St Mary's bells are inscribed thus; \\" We were all fixed here by voluntary subscription, in the year 1775.\\" \\" Happiness to all worthy contributors.\\" \\" Success to the Worshipful Company of Drapers.\\" \\" Unanimity and welfare to all the inhabitants of Salop.\\" \\" Peace and Felicity to this Church and Nation.\\" \\" Prosperity to St. Mary's Parish.\\" \\" E. Blakeway, M.A., Minister, J. Watkins, J. Warren, E. Elsmere, H. Kent, Churchwardens.\\" \\" May all whom I summon to their grave, enjoy everlasting bliss.\\" To each inscription is added, \\" Pack & Chapman, London, Fecit 1775.\\" An old bell from Battlefield, cast by Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester, was hung in a turret at the south-west angle of the chancel as a sanctus bell in 1871. The two treble bells have again been re-cast, and now bear the following inscriptions:- \\" W. G. Pennyman, Vicar. Edw. Burd , Wm. Alltree, A. E. Lloyd Oswell, H. Steward, Churchwardens.\\" \\" Ring out the darkness of the land, Ring in the Christ that is to be.\\" =Stained glass= The stained glass behind the altar and choir The stained glass is of various styles dating from the 14th to the 19th centuries, and was brought to St Mary's from elsewhere, much of it from Europe, in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is said that \\"no other church in the country has a collection to equal it\\". The \\"main treasure\\" is the east window of the chancel, which contains a depiction of the Jesse Tree. By tradition it was made for the Franciscan church in Shrewsbury, moved to St Chad's Church after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and then to St Mary's in 1792. Although it was much restored in 1858 by David and Charles Evans, much of the original glass remains. This glass is dated between 1327 and 1353. Glass in the north windows of the chancel and the central part of the south aisle were made for the Cistercian Altenberg Abbey between 1505 and 1532. They depict scenes from the life of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, and were bought for St Mary's by Rev W. G. Rowland, the vicar in 1845, at a cost of ¬£425 (¬£ in 2014). Also in the south aisle are two windows from the church of St Aspern, Cologne. Windows elsewhere consist of part of a collection of 15th-century stained glass bought in 1801 by Sir Brooke Boothby at a cost of ¬£200 (¬£ in 2014). Some of this came from Trier, and the remainder from the Cistercian nunnery of Herchen. In the south chapel is glass from the church of Saint- Jacques in Li√®ge. Elsewhere there is glass dating from the 16th century of Dutch and Flemish origin. Much of the 19th-century glass is by David and Charles Evans. In March 2007 some of the glass was loaned to the Schn√ºtgen Museum in Cologne for their exhibition of 16th-century German stained glass. =Monuments= These include an inscription on the tower to the memory of Robert Cadman, a tightrope walker who was killed in 1739. Also in the tower is a recumbent effigy by Richard Westmacott junior depicting Col C. R. Cureton who was killed in India in 1848. Inside the west entrance of the nave is a brass upon marble plaque memorial to men of the 85th Regiment of Foot who died serving in the Afghan War of 1879-80. In the north transept is a wall memorial to Rev John Brickdale Blakeway, vicar of the church, and a local historian, who died in 1826. Also in the north transept are memorials to Nicholas Stafford, who died in 1473, and Admiral Benbow who died of wounds in 1702. The oldest memorial in the church stands in the arch between the chancel and Trinity Chapel. It is a tomb chest with the effigy of a knight, and probably dates from the 1340s. In the south aisle is a grave slab from about 1100 carved with a cross and interlacing. Trinity Chapel contains separate stone tablets to men of the Shropshire Yeomanry who died in the World Wars, besides a roll of honour listing names of those who died in the Second, and a sandstone parish war memorial headed by a crucifix to parishioners who died during World War I, with a list of names that include VC recipient W.N. Stone Evidence for him living in Shrewsbury has not been found, and it gives post- nominal initials of DSO and MC, neither of which he received, in addition to his VC. Katherine Mary Harley (1855-1917), a committed Christian and Suffragist, is also commemorated on the memorial, she was killed at Monastir in 1917 aged 61, while nursing Serbian refugees. Katherine trained at the Salop Infirmary adjacent to St Mary's; she was the sister of both Field Marshal Sir John French and the Irish Nationalist Charlotte Despard. Churchyard The churchyard contains the plain sandstone war memorial cross to Shrewsbury townsmen who died in the two World Wars, erected 1920 after World War I by the \\"National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers (Shrewsbury branch)\\" (predecessor of the British Legion). On corner posts of the stone kerbs are listed battles or campaigns from World War I in which the men died. Dr Samuel Butler, headmaster of Shrewsbury School and later Bishop of Lichfield, is buried in the churchyard where his Latin-inscribed tombstone is still visible. Thomas Anderson, a soldier in the Dragoons was executed, as a deserter and Jacobite sympathizer, near the Butchers' Arbour on Kingsland, Shrewsbury on 11 December 1752. He was the last English martyr for the Stuart cause. The Revd Benjamin Wingfield, in the face of official hostility, allowed Anderson to be buried in St Mary's Churchyard and read the burial service over the grave. The grave is situated in the south-western quarter of the churchyard.Thomas Phillips, James Bowen, Charles Hulbert,(1837) The History and Antiquities of Shrewsbury: From Its First Foundation to the Present Time, Comprising a Recital of Occurrences and Remarkable Events, for Above Twelve Hundred Years, Volume 1.p. 256 See also *Grade I listed churches in Shropshire *List of ecclesiastical works by Paley and Austin *List of churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust in the English Midlands *Listed buildings in Shrewsbury (southeast central area) Photographs of St Mary's including many of the fine windows References Citations Sources * * Category:Grade I listed churches in Shropshire Category:Church of England church buildings in Shropshire Category:English churches with Norman architecture Category:English Gothic architecture in Shropshire Category:Churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust Category:Churches in Shrewsbury Category:Paley and Austin buildings Category:Former Royal Peculiars ","title":"St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury"},{"id":"29132862","title":"Little Ten Conference"},{"id":"29132872","text":"Brad Suggs is a singer and songwriter, but best known as a guitarist that contributed greatly to the legacy of Phillips' Sun and Phillips' International labels.

When Suggs wasn't working in the studio he worked full-time at Sears. James wanted Suggs to go on the road touring with him, but Suggs decided not to due to family obligations. Instead, Suggs began playing with the Slim Rhodes Band.Davis, H. (2000, January 14.) Brad Suggs: Sun Records' forgotten guitarist. Goldmine. 26(508), 40-43. He played with the Rhodes group on all their Sun recordings, as well as on eight tracks recorded in 1950 during the earliest days of the Memphis Recording Service (1). When Suggs began releasing singles Rockabilly was not a household word yet and the Sun label was still being shaped (trying to find its niche). In 1959, Suggs began to work in the semi-official capacity of Sun producer and bandleader (1). It was at this time that his five singles were issued on the Phillips International label. His other accomplishments include backing up Elvis Presley during the King‚Äôs homecoming concert on February 25, 1961. (Suggs can be seen playing guitar in the back ground of the famous picture of comedian George Jessell bowing at Elvis' feet during the concert.) He also worked with the Memphis Symphony Orchestra. Suggs‚Äô recordings can be found on The Complete Sun Singles, Volumes 1, 2 and 6, issued by Bear Family Records.

Biography=Background and early career Charles Ross was the son of Lieutenant Robert Hunter Ross, RN, and a great-great grandson of William Ross, 12th Lord Ross. He entered the navy on 1 March 1788 as a captain's servant aboard the sloop , commanded by Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds. He remained in her, stationed at Newfoundland, until December. From February to April 1790 he served aboard the 74-gun , the guard ship at Portsmouth, under Captain Anthony James Pye Molloy, then moved into the (50), flagship of Vice-Admiral Mark Milbanke, Commodore-Governor at Newfoundland, before returning to the Edgar, under Captain Albemarle Bertie. French Revolutionary Wars Between March 1793 and April 1796 he served as master's mate and then midshipman, firstly in the fire-ship Conflagration and then the frigate (28), both commanded by Captain Thomas Francis Fremantle, then aboard (98) and (100), the flagships of Sir Hyde Parker, and the (100), flagship of Sir John Jervis. While attached to the Tartar and St. George he served on shore during the capture and evacuation of Toulon, and took part in the land operations connected with the capture of Saint-Florent, Bastia, and Calvi, in the island of Corsica, and fought in the battles off Genoa and the Hy√®res Islands in March and July 1795.O'Byrne (1849), pp.1004‚Äì1005. On 14 July 1796, he was promoted to lieutenant in the (74), Captain James Douglas, stationed off C√°diz; and on 26 August 1797 was transferred to (20), Captain George Eyre, and then on 5 June 1798 to (98), flagship of Sir Hyde Parker, in the West Indies. He served on shore at M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas and contributed to the capture and destruction of several privateers and armed boats on the coast of Saint- Domingue. In January 1800 he was appointed acting-commander of the brig-sloop (18), and was confirmed in his rank on 11 June. However, on 8 October his ship was wrecked on the Honda Bank, off the northern coast of Cuba, and was abandoned and burned. After commanding the frigate (32), for about six months, on 5 July 1802 he was appointed acting-captain of (36), and was officially posted on 15 October. Napoleonic Wars In December 1803 Ross was appointed to command of the frigate (36), employed at the blockade of Saint- Domingue and witnessed the surrender of the French squadron with the remains of General Rochambeau's army from Cap Fran√ßais. In early 1804 Ross took part in an expedition led by Captain John Bligh to capture the Dutch island of Cura√ßao. The British believed that the garrison there was only 160 strong, and weakened by disease, so their force consisted only of the 74s and , frigates and Pique, and the schooner Gipsy. On their arrival at the Willemstad on 31 January the British learned that they had been misinformed about the local strength, which consisted of 250 regular troops, reinforced by a local militia and the crews of the vessels in the harbour. The Dutch refused to surrender, and unable to force the harbour, which was defended by shore batteries, the frigate Hatslaar and two French privateers, the British were compelled to attempt a landing. Leaving the two frigates to blockade the harbour, the British sailed to a nearby cove and landed a 605-man strong force of seamen and marines which captured Fort Piscadero. The British then landed guns, and erected artillery batteries on heights to the west of the town. Over the next few days the British, the Dutch in Fort Amsterdam and their French allies fought an artillery duel and several skirmishes with little result, so the British turned their guns on the town and shipping, destroying some of the former by fire. However, disease, casualties, and lack of provisions soon took their toll on the British, who were eventually forced to abandon the enterprise on 25 February. Pique continued to operate in the Caribbean, making numerous captures, including the French cutter Le Terreur of 10 guns and 75 men, on 18 March 1804, the Spanish ship-of-war Diligentia (in company with ), and the 18-gun corvette Orquijo on 8 February 1805. On the morning of 26 March 1806 Pique was en route from Saint-Domingue to Cura√ßao, when she spotted two 16-gun French brig-corvettes and , and gave chase. By 13:00, Pique commenced firing at long range, and at 14:00 she closed with the two brigs. After about twenty minutes, Pha√´ton was crippled, so about 30 men from Pique boarded her, while Ross stood off to pursue the Voltigeur. No sooner had the boarding party stepped aboard than the French crew, concealed behind fallen masts and sails, let fly with a volley of musket fire, killing ten and wounding fourteen. Ross, when aware of what had happened, sent a boat with more men, who quickly compelled the French to surrender. He then sailed after Voltigeur, who was eventually overtaken and captured without further opposition. A clasp to the Naval General Service Medal, marked \\"Pique 26 March 1806\\" was authorized for this action in 1849. During his command of the Desiree and Pique, Ross captured, in different prizes, as many as 140 guns and 1,500 men; four of his captures were added to the Royal Navy. He eventually left Pique in August 1807. =War of 1812= From 13 August 1812 he served as flag-captain to Sir George Cockburn, commanding the 74s , , , while taking part in operations on the coast of North America during the War of 1812. In this capacity he was present at the Battle of Rappahannock River in April 1813, and took part in the various actions against Joshua Barney's Chesapeake Bay Flotilla in mid-1814. In January 1815, while commanding the Albion he conducted a boat expedition up St. Marys River, Georgia, before returning to Cumberland Island, with a ship loaded with timber, and an English East Indiaman which had been captured by an American privateer. He also embarked all the produce collected at the town of St. Mary's in the vessels taken there by Captain Robert Barrie, blew up the fort on Point Peter and a battery (mounting six 24-pounders and two brass 6-pounders) and destroyed the barracks and storehouses, together with some merchandise and guns that were not deemed fit to bring away. Postwar career Following the end of the war Ross, now commanding Cockburn's flagship , was responsible for conveying Napoleon Bonaparte into exile at St. Helena. His first impression of his passenger was described in a letter to a friend: :He is fat, rather what we call pot-bellied, and altho' his leg is well-shaped, it is rather clumsy, and his walk appears rather affected, something between a waddle and a swagger ‚Äî but probably not being used to the motion of a ship might have given him that appearance. He is very sallow and [has] quite light grey eyes, rather thin, greasy-looking brown hair, and altogether a very nasty, priestlike-looking fellow.Shorter (1908), p.60. Northumberland sailed from Plymouth on 8 August, arriving at St Helena on 15 October 1815.Shorter (1908), p.73. During the voyage Ross's relations with the former emperor were limited since neither spoke each other's language, though Ross noted that on leaving the ship Bonaparte \\"returned me his thanks for my attention to him with rather a better grace than I should have given him credit for.\\"Shorter (1908), p.62. Ross was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 8 December 1815. From 1817‚Äì1820 he served in the Ordinary at Portsmouth; and from July 1822 to January 1837, served as Commissioner of the Navy at Jamaica, Malta, and Plymouth. He was promoted to rear-admiral on 10 January 1837, and from 4 September 1839 until 1841 was commander-in-chief on the Pacific Station, flying his flag in the (50). He was promoted to vice-admiral on 24 April 1847, but died two years later on 2 March 1849. Personal life In January 1803 he married Sarah Cockburn, the distant cousin and sister-in-law of Admiral Sir George Cockburn, in Kingston, Jamaica. They had four children; Elizabeth Ross (1803‚Äì1844), Frances Mary Cockburn Ross (b.1809), Commander Charles William Decourcy Ross, RN (1812‚Äì1848), and Georgina Mary Cockburn Ross (b.1819).

Benjamin Ring House is a historic building on the Brandywine Battlefield in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. It served as headquarters for General George Washington prior to and during the September 11, 1777 Battle of Brandywine. History Rear of the house. The house was built in 1731 by Thomas G. Clark.John W. Jordan, ed., A History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania (New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1914), p. 284. Benjamin Ring (died 1804), a farmer and mill operator, was its owner in 1777. As a Quaker, he did not participate in the war. Located along the main road from Philadelphia to Baltimore, the house was about a mile east of the ford at Brandywine Creek. At the end of August, some 17,000 British troops landed at Elkton, Maryland, and were marching toward Philadelphia. Washington had about 14,600 troops waiting to attack. Washington held a Council of War at the house on September 9, and anticipated that the British Army would cross at the ford. Instead, on September 11, the bulk of British forces crossed upstream and attacked from the north, surprising and overwhelming the Continental soldiers. The 19-year-old Marquis de Lafayette was wounded in the battle, and carried to the nearby Gideon Gilpin House.Jordan, p. 284. Ring later operated the house as a tavern, and his son operated it as a hotel. Washington had asked Benjamin Ring to lead the Continental army's retreat out of the area when he realized the battle was a loss. Because of his age and weight Ring turned down his request and suggested William Harvey. This was not the William Harvey, Jr. that \\"defended\\" the Harvey House on the west bank, but from one of the second generation of Harveys that lived on the east bank. He led the Continental army to safety. This story is from Benjamin Ring's grandson, Samuel, in a letter he wrote to his cousin in the 1830s. Eli Harvey later bought the Ring House and ran a tavern. The Harveys had been maltsters in both England and in Chadds Ford.Jordan, p. 284. Historic site A September 16, 1931 fire severely damaged the house. Brandywine Battlefield Park became a Pennsylvania State Park in 1949 and a National Historic Landmark in 1961. The house was restored to its 1777 appearance, and opened as a house museum.Karen Smith Furst, Around Chadds Ford (Arcadia Publishing, 2005), p. 20. A collection of Quaker-style furniture is on display, with historical information about the battle and Washington's stay at the house.

It was a single engined monoplane intended to compete with the Dewoitine D.520, but was unsuccessful, only a single example being built. Design and development In 1937, the French Air Ministry issued an official specification for a single-engined fighter to follow-on from and replace the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406. The new fighter was to be powered by a single Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51, rated at 1,100 hp (821 kW).Green 1960, p. 45.

When the prototype was completed in January 1939, the planned Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51 engine was not yet available, and it was fitted with an 860 hp (640 kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31 engine to make its first flight on 31 January 1939. With this engine, the SNCAO was underpowered, and by the time the prototype was passed to the authorities for official testing in August 1939, the Dewoitine D.520 had already been ordered into large-scale production.Green 1960, pp. 37‚Äì38. Despite this, several sources claim that a batch of 12 aircraft to be powered by 12Y-51 engines were ordered.Breffort and Jouneau 2004, pp. 80‚Äì81.

Built in 1745, it is one of the oldest houses in Southington. Its property was also the site of the early manufacture of hydraulic cement. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Luman Andrews House stands in a rural area of central eastern Southington, on the east side of Andrews Street just south of its junction with Woodruff Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a four-light transom window and framed by a Greek Revival surround with pilasters and a corniced entablature. The side gable ends have also been fully pedimented in another Greek Revival alteration. The property also includes the remains of a 19th-century lime kiln. and A quarry on the site was the source of volcanic rock used in Portland cement during the 1830s and 1840s. The house was built in 1745 by Nathaniel Messenger with just four bays, and was enlarged by its fifth bay in 1795 by Eunice Judd Root. In 1818 the house was purchased by Luman Andrews, the son of a local American Revolutionary War here. Andrews discovered blue limestone on the property, an important ingredient in portland cement, which prior to that time was imported to the United States from England. The quarry and kiln operation that Andrews established was productive until about 1860. The house's Greek Revival alterations were made during Andrews' ownership of the property. It was sold out of the Andrews family in 1873.

It is located on Township Road 604 approximately west of Whitecourt, southwest of Highway 43, and south of the Athabasca River.  History  Windfall was founded by Canadian Fina Oil Ltd. shortly after the company drilled a well and discovered gas in the Windfall field in March 1955. As a result of this discovery, and discoveries in two nearby fields by two other companies, the company developed a pilot project plant to recover gas, sulphur, and hydrocarbons from the three fields through an interlocking recovery process. Built over two phases, the community included an apartment complex, 17 houses in excess of on basements with paved driveways and detached garages, and a school consisting of three rooms, and by 1961, Windfall had a population of 101. Infrastructure included water, wastewater, gas, and power utilities, as well as roads, sidewalks, and streetlights. Due to the success of the pilot project plant, a larger plant was built by the Pan American Petroleum Corporation. It opened in April 1962 and was named the West Whitecourt Plant. A bridge over the Athabasca River, between Windfall and Highway 43, was built in time for the opening of the plant. As a result, the up to four-hour commute from Whitecourt was reduced to a commute. An extension of the Canadian National rail line from Whitecourt to Windfall was completed later that year in November 1962. By 1966, the population of Windfall declined to 78. Shortly thereafter, those families that lived in Windfall moved to Whitecourt, approximately to the east, or away via Township Road 604 and Highway 43, rendering it a ghost town despite the adjacent West Whitecourt Plant remaining in operation. The community's houses were later relocated to Fox Creek, approximately to the northwest, or away via Township Road 604 and Highway 43. To this date, directional signs along Highway 43 approaching its intersection with Township Road 604 still indicate the presence of Windfall.

Early career The son of musically-orientated parents who encouraged him to train as a classical pianist, Neil Conti discovered another musical inspiration upon seeing his cousin Morgan Fisher perform onstage as keyboardist for the very popular 1970s band Mott the Hoople. Twelve years old at the time and inspired by Mott the Hoople's drummer, Dale Griffin, he started playing drums and, over the next few years, gained some drumming experience with numerous local rock bands while showing an interest in jazz and soul music. After completing a diploma in graphic design, he moved to London, where his musical apprenticeship included a range of styles such as reggae, calypso and funk. Among the early bands in which he drummed were Linx, Tropicana Steel Band, Kokomo and Combo Passe as well as various recording sessions with such artists such as Pauline Black. In late 1983, he joined Prefab Sprout after hearing the band playing on the Richard Skinner show and calling the office of Kitchenware Records to offer his services. He became an integral member of the band, recording numerous silver, gold and platinum albums and touring UK/Europe. During his tenure with Prefab Sprout, he also became a first-call session musician, playing on records by many well known artists, including David Bowie singles \\"Dancing in the Street\\" and \\"Absolute Beginners\\", as well as playing in Bowie's band for his Live Aid set in 1985. Due to band inactivity, he left Prefab Sprout in 1993 while continuing to tour and record as a session musician.  Backstage Club  In 1989 Neil Conti and Raye Cosbert (who later become promoter of Massive Attack and manager of Amy Winehouse) started \\"Backstage\\", a live bi-weekly music club for artists to meet and jam together. Neil's motivation was the closing of the famous Speakeasy Club - a popular watering hole for London musicians to meet up. The club was based at the Borderline in Charing Cross Road, later moving to the Jazz Caf√© in Camden. The club spawned many imitations in the Soho area and became a hotbed of talent and A+R men, launching the careers of Ronnie Jordan, Seal, Keziah Jones, Juliet Roberts and D-Influence among others. The club was featured in an MTV documentary and recorded a live CD, sponsored by Levi's. Neil terminated the club in 1992 due to time constraints and conflicts with his session work.  Present  Following a move to France in 2001, Neil Conti opened a recording studio in Montpellier, where he produces artists. Still an active drummer, he frequently travels to London to work or, alternatively, provides drum tracks by internet from his studio in France. The studio, Minimoon, is staffed by him and recording engineer Jeff Fernandez.

The film proved very popular with audiences and the following year spawned a sequel The Viper, although this was much less successful. There is no indication of the film having been shown after its original cinema run. The British Film Institute do not hold a print in the BFI National Archive, although they do have a number of production stills on file. Both The Vulture and The Viper are included on the BFI's \\"75 Most Wanted\\" list of missing British feature films. Plot Hopeless but eager would-be private detective Cedric Gull (Hulbert) has just obtained a diploma from a backstreet 'School of Detection' and is keen to put his new qualification to good use. Fortuitously, he happens to stumble across a crime scene at the office of a diamond merchant, who has just been robbed and assaulted and is being tended by his secretary Sylvia (Brook). The police arrive on the scene, but despite Cedric's proud boasts about his sleuthing qualifications, they decline his kind offers of help. Striking out on his own, Cedric becomes convinced that the robbery was the work of a notorious gang of East End Chinese jewel thieves led by a mysterious and sinister individual known as The Vulture. He takes on board his ex-con sidekick Stiffy (Walters) and the pair set off in pursuit of the criminals. Their plans come unstuck when their inept bungling lands them both in prison. However the police, aware of their interest in the case, agree to allow them out to act as decoys. Cedric learns that Sylvia has been abducted by the criminals. He decides to disguise himself as Chinese and try to infiltrate their hideout and rescue Sylvia. After a good deal of hapless buffoonery and narrow escapes from sticky situations, he and Stiffy finally succeed in freeing Sylvia, unmasking the thieves and uncovering the identity of the elusive Vulture.

Kine Weekly noted: \\"The peculiar fecklessness of the star is well adapted to the super-inanity of the story, and the film, with its crazy humour and asinine 'hero' goes all out for the well-known Hulbert effects - and gets them\\", also praising \\"excellent production values\\". The notoriously hard-to- please Monthly Film Bulletin was prepared to concede that it was \\"an amusing story...adequately directed and the fun well-timed\\" and that Hulbert \\"makes the most of his opportunities\\".

This group could be considered to includes the descendants of the Norse-Gaelic kings. * Hiberno-Norman or Old English (Ireland) nobility, descendants of the settlers who came to Ireland from Wales, Normandy and England after the Norman invasions of England and Ireland in 1066 and 1169‚Äì71, respectively. * Peerage of Ireland, whose titles were created by the English and later British monarchs of Ireland in their capacity as Lord or King of Ireland. These groups are not mutually exclusive.

The submarine is named after Knyaz Vladimir the Great.  History  Project 955A was developed by the Rubin Design Bureau, and the chief designer was Sergey Kovalev. The keel was expected to have been laid down in 2010 but this was delayed until July 2012 because of a price dispute between the Russian MOD and the United Shipbuilding Corporation. Knyaz Vladimir is the first unit of the Project 955A sub-class and will differ by several modifications from the previous units of the project 955. These modifications will include major structural changes, reduced acoustic signature, and more modern communication equipment. While initially reported to have four more (20 in total) launch tubes, the 955A includes 16 missile tubes same as the project 955. The submarine will be armed with the newest Russian submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM), the RSM-56 Bulava. Knyaz Vladimir and its sister ships will eventually replace the Soviet-era and s in the Russian Navy. Knyaz Vladimir was floated out on 17 November 2017, and began the first stage of factory trials by late November 2018. The submarine returned back to Sevmash in early 2019 and was to begin a second stage of factory trials by late June 2019. On 22 October 2019, Aleksandr Moiseyev, commander in chief of the Northern Fleet, stated that Knyaz Vladimir is expected to complete its sea trials by the end of the year. According to Moiseyev, completion of the sea trials is to be accompanied by the launch of a Bulava missile. On 29 October, the submarine conducted a successful Bulava launch from a submerged position in the White Sea. According to TASS' defense industry sources, commissioning of the Knyaz Vladimir has been delayed until the first quarter of 2020 due to a number of detected deficiencies. The following Komsomolskaya Pravda report, citing Alexei Rakhmanov, President of the USC, has specified the commissioning period as \\"end of January\\" 2020.

It is licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya, the country's central bank and national banking regulator. Location The bank's headquarters are located at NCBA Centre, at the junction of Mara Road and Ragati Road, in the neighborhood called Upper Hill, in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. The geographical coordinates of the group's headquarters are:01¬∞17'52.0\\"S, 36¬∞48'46.0\\"E (Latitude:-1.297778; Longitude:36.812778).  Overview  NCBA Bank Kenya is a subsidiary of NCBA Group Plc, a large financial services provider in East Africa, and parts of West Africa. The group maintains its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. NCBA Group Plc owns subsidiary companies in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Ivory Coast. , NCBA Bank's total asset base was valued at about KSh487.8 billion (US$4.88 billion). At that time, the bank was ranked in position number three, by total assets, behind KCB Bank Kenya Limited and Equity Bank Kenya Limited. History NIC Bank Kenya Plc roots trace back to 1959 when its parent company, NIC Group, was formed as a joint venture by Standard Bank Limited of South Africa and Mercantile Credit Company Limited of the United Kingdom. NIC was initially a non-bank financial institution (NBFI). NIC Bank Kenya Plc was incorporated in 2016 as a result of the corporate reorganization of NIC Bank Group. Prior to January 2017, NIC Bank Group operated both as a licensed bank and a holding company for its subsidiaries. On 12 September 2016, NIC Bank Group announced its intention to incorporate a new wholly owned subsidiary, NIC Bank Kenya Plc, to which it would transfer its Kenyan banking business, assets and liabilities. The rationale for the re-organisation is that by converting NIC Bank Group into a non-operating holding company (as defined under the Banking Act) that owns both banking and non-banking subsidiary companies in order to support the Group‚Äôs medium and long term strategy. The group reorganization was completed on 31 August 2017 upon approval from shareholders and the regulators. In 2017, the Central Bank of Kenya appointed NIC Bank as asset and liabilities consultant for Imperial Bank Limited (in receivership). Effectively, NIC Bank took over the responsibility of returning funds to the failed bank's deposit customers. The agreement also allows NIC to acquire some of the deposits, assets and liabilities of Imperial once its receiver manager the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation starts liquidating the bank. In December 2018, NIC Group announced that it would be merging with Commercial Bank of Africa Group (CBA) creating Kenya's third-biggest bank, by assets. The transaction was approved by the Kenyan regulators and shareholders in April 2019. As of 18 May 2019, the merged group was still operating two sets of banks in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania but was in the process of seeking regulatory approval to merge these business so that they can have one bank in each country and a group rebranding. On 27 September 2019, the Central Bank of Kenya approved the merger and name changes, effective 1 October 2019. The merged non-banking holding company became NCBA Group Plc and the Kenyan subsidiary of the merged entity became NCBA Bank Kenya Plc. The names of the merged entity in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ivory Coast will re-brand accordingly. Branch network As at 28 February 2020, NCBA Bank Kenya maintained 64 networked branches and 5 banking agencies in Kenya. NCBA Bank's partnership with the Kenya Post Office Savings Bank enables the provision of cash collection services for its customers through Postbank‚Äôs network of 94 branches in Kenya. NCBA Group Members of the NCBA Group Plc include the following. # NCBA Bank Kenya ‚Äì Retail banking ‚Äì Nairobi, Kenya 100% Shareholding # NCBA Capital ‚Äì Investment banking ‚Äì Nairobi, Kenya 100% Shareholding # NCBA Capital Securities ‚Äì Securities brokerage ‚Äì Nairobi, Kenya ‚Äì 100% Shareholding # NCBA Bank Tanzania ‚Äì Retail banking ‚Äì Dar es Salaam, Tanzania 69% Shareholding # NCBA Bank Uganda ‚Äì Retail banking ‚Äì Kampala, Uganda 100% Shareholding. # NCBA Bank Rwanda: Retail banking : Kigali, Rwanda 100% Shareholding # M-Shwari Mobile Banking: Mobile money bank service: Abidjan, Ivory Coast Joint Venture with MTN Group.

It is one of three species of \\"cunjevoi\\" in Australasia (the other two being the yellow cunjevoi P. dalbyi and the doppelganger cunjevoi P. doppelgangera). It is the first reported species of marine organism to create a \\"foam-nest\\" for its larvae. Distribution Pyura praeputialis is common in coastal areas of the Australian mainland and ranges from southern Queensland to Cape Otway in Victoria. It is a non-indigenous species in Antofagasta, Chile. This species is an ecosystem engineer that can drastically alter habitats by overgrowing other sessile marine invertebrates.

However, the positive impacts it can have are shelter for juveniles that are being hunted, protection from desiccation, beneficial interactions between organisms, and coexistence of other species.

It was established in 1995 on the privatization of the Hungarian aluminium industry. MAL's initial assets were the Bakony bauxite mine, an alumina factory in Ajka and an aluminium smelter in Inota (municipality of V√°rpalota), all of them in Veszpr√©m County northwestern Hungary.. The company set up subsidiaries in Germany and Romania, and acquired majority holdings in the SILKEM, producing zeolites and ground alumina in Kidriƒçevo, Slovenia, and Rudnici Boksita Jajce, which operates a high-grade bauxite mine near Jajce, central Bosnia. The smelting facilities at Inota were converted into a recycling operation in 2006, and sold off as INOTAL Aluminium Processing Zrt. in 2007. On 4 October 2010, a retaining dam failed on one of the red mud ponds at the company's Ajka alumina factory, spilling 600,000‚Äì700,000 cubic metres of highly alkaline and corrosive (caustic) red mud arising as a residual product from the treatment of bauxite with sodium hydroxide. At least ten people died, and about 150 people were injured, in the nearby settlements of Kolont√°r and Devecser...

It was created at the behest of Napoleon III and opened August 30, 1857 during the Second French Empire. The initial purpose was simply for practising military manoeuvres, but it quickly turned into a showcase of the French Imperial Army, a theatrical propaganda display, where French citizens could meet the army and watch parades. Each year the camp was transformed into a town of tents and wooden chalets.The Bonapartes in Ch√¢lons en Champagne, by Jean-Paul Barbier and Michel Bursal, Marnaises Studies, SACSAM, 2009. The camp survived the fall of the Second Empire in 1872, but changed into a training camp and a departure point for troops engaging in overseas operations. The camp is used for military manoeuvres, and cavalry training, along with the neighbouring 2,500 hectare large Camp de Moronvilliers. Firing of live ordnance (rockets, missiles) is prohibited. Mourmelon 131 military airbase A military airbase, designated base a√©rienne 131 Mourmelon, was in operation near the camp from the beginning of the 1900s until 1965, when it was shut down. This site also hosted a flying school, founded by Henri Farman in 1909. The Paris 1924 Summer Olympics The camp was selected to host the individual and team 600 m free rifle shooting events for the 1924 Summer Olympics in neighbouring Paris. To that purpose, temporary facilities were constructed on and near the camp's firing range.  Other history  On 4 August 1988, the dead body of 20-year-old Fabienne Leroy was found at the camp, after she was kidnapped from a supermarket in nearby Ch√¢lons-en- Champagne and shot the previous day. In May 2008, Michel Fourniret and Monique Olivier were convicted of the murder of Leroy and six other girls and women and sentenced to life imprisonment.

It presently houses a bed and breakfast inn. Description and history The Josiah Cowles House stands on the south side of Marion Avenue, between Sunny Ridge Drive and Old Mill Road west of the village center of Plantsville and Interstate 84. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a wide double door at its center. The door is framed by simple trim, while the windows are surmounted by slightly projecting caps. Although traditionally ascribed a construction date of 1728, the architecture suggests it was built closer to 1750, probably around the time of Josiah Cowles' second marriage. and The house was the residence of Captain Josiah Cowles, one of the early settlers of Southington. Cowles was born in Farmington, Connecticut on November 20, 1713. He was a justice of the peace and a captain in the local militia. He held a number of town offices, and was viewed as a leading man in town. At the very first town meeting after the incorporation of Southington, held November 11, 1779, the residents appointed Cowles, along with Jonathan Root to a committee to \\"provide for the families of officers and soldiers in the field.\\" In 1774, Cowles was appointed to a committee to deliver provisions to Boston, in response to the British blockade of Boston harbor.

After completing his secondary education he studied literature in Zaragoza for a while and then moved to Paris to study ancient Greek history at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales. Jes√∫s Ferrero, like Javier Mar√≠as or Antonio Mu√±oz Molina, is a writer of that new Spanish prose which developed after La Movida Madrile√±a (Madriliene Movement), one of the early post-modern currents. He has written numerous novels, poetry collections, short stories, essays and screenplays. He is, among other things, co-author of Pedro Almod√≥var's film Matador. He is one of a group of well-known Spanish novelists, which includes Julio Llamazares, Javier Cercas, and Andr√©s Trapiello, who have published fiction in the vein of \\"historical memory\\", focusing on the Spanish Civil War and the Francoist State.Gina Herrmann, Mass Graves on Spanish TV, essay in Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.172, 2010https://www.peterowen.com/julio-llamazares-postmemory/ Ferrero's debut, Chinese-set novel 'Belver Yin' (1981) was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed in post-Franco Spanish literature, and helped him to establish himself as one of the major writers of La Movida years. With novels set in Tibet ('Opium', 1986), Barcelona ('Lady Pepa', 1988) or Berlin ('D√©bora Blenn', 1988), Ferrero continued during the eighties a literary exploration characterized by eclectic intertextuality. Fererro‚Äôs book 'El Efecto Doppler' (1990), follows a precise choreography which shows the protagonist, Dar√≠o, caught up in a complex tale. During an evening meal in Paris the young Rosaura blows her brains out in front of the diners: \\"Suddenly she looked at me and took a pistol from her bag. Without stopping her whistling she put the weapon to her temple.\\" Every gesture, every look follows a kind of message, and Dar√≠o, Rosaura‚Äôs cousin, takes it upon himself to create a meaningful entity from the seemingly unconnected clues. In calm, very precise language and in a very detailed, cleverly devised structure Ferrero tells in his novel a gripping love story and at the same time makes us consider the limits of our perception. Precise, too, is that view which the hero has in the novel 'El diablo en los ojos' (1998). Since young Leo Salgado has been focussing his camera lens on his own family, he senses the great influence of this instrument which is able to record everyday trivialities and their most intimate facets. The camera here is the up-and-coming creative genius which captures, with almost cruel clarity, the disintegration of the family. The action of Jes√∫s Ferrero‚Äôs novel, 'Juanelo o el hombre nuevo' (2000), is set in Toledo in the 16th century. The protagonist in this fantasy-tale, a good- looking youth, gradually comes to discover the terrible history of his origin as he becomes more and more involved in events in Toledo. It becomes clear that he is an artificially created human being, a golem, a new kind of human being. The novel is a good example which again makes clear Ferrero‚Äôs basic themes: \\"Destruction begins with the first tears in the cradle and ends when, in our parchment-like hands, time dies.\\" Jes√∫s Ferrero‚Äôs writing shows a rebirth of the old myths and also tells of the banal, sometimes absurd everyday stories. It reflects the utopias of the twentieth century like those of 'Metropolis'. Ferrero‚Äôs style has been seen as close to that of Cervantes or Kafka. The author loves adopting classical narrative patterns while also modernizing and using them aesthetically with new stylistic features. Since 1995 he has been living in Madrid where he teaches literature.

In the 1730s, he was active in Schleswig-Holstein and from 1740 in Denmark where he settled in 1752. His early works include the Marg√•rd manor house on the island of Funen which relies on French country house architecture for inspiration. He collaborated with Nicolai Eigtved on a number of projects in Copenhagen in the early 1750s, including the Dehn, Bernstorff and Berckentin Mansions in Bredgade in the Frederiksstaden neighbourhood which was under development around that time. North of the city, on the shore of Lake Bagsv√¶rd, he designed the Frederiksdal pavilion. In 1760, Rosenborg returned to Schleswig- Holstein to assume a position as master builder. His most important works there are Gr√•sten Palace (1758‚Äì59) and Augustenborg Castle (attributed, 1770‚Äì76). In 1771 he finished the Royal Danish Mint in Altona (Elbe) near Hamburg.

It is located along Batasan Road in Batasan Hills, Quezon City. The complex was initially the home of the Batasang Pambansa, the former parliament of the Philippines which was established as an interim assembly in 1978 and finally as an official body in 1984. Under the 1973 constitution, it replaced the bicameral Congress of the Philippines established under the 1935 Commonwealth constitution. When the bicameral Congress was restored in 1987, the complex was set aside as the home of the House of Representatives. The Main Building of the complex is often referred to as the Batasang Pambansa. History=Construction Following the naming of Quezon City as the new capital city of the Philippines in 1948, a cornerstone for a Capitol building was laid on Constitution Hill, now Batasan Hills, in Quezon City on October 22, 1949.National Historical Commission of the Philippines - October 22, 1949 - The cornerstone of the Capitol Building at Constitution Hill, Quezon City, is laid. The location was part of a larger National Government Center, which was meant to house the three branches of the Philippine government (legislative, executive, and judicial). In 1956, architect Federico S. Ilustre laid out the master plan for the location, which was set aside to be the new home of the Congress (made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives). Ilustre had also designed the buildings for the new legislative center. Public reception to the building's design was lukewarm, so a newer design by the National Planning Commission under architect Anselmo Alquinto replaced the Ilustre-designed one. By 1963, however, only the concrete foundations and steel frame were laid out. Ultimately, due to lack of funding, the Capitol was never completed. The uncompleted structure sat in the area for more than a decade before being torn down.PhilSTAR.com - SM & QC: Visions of a City During the presidency of Ferdinand E. Marcos, the plans for a legislative complex were revived. By that time, the 1973 constitution had replaced the bicameral Congress with the Batasang Pambansa, a unicameral parliament. The new complex was accordingly designed to house only one legislative body. Felipe M. Mendoza was designated as the architect of the complex, and its surrounding area.Arkitekturang Filipino - Arkitektura.ph (UAP, NCCA, B(b)AGO) - Models of the Batasang Pambansa ComplexLayout of Constitution Hill, Quezon City, by Felipe M. Mendoza The uncompleted structure for the Capitol building was torn down to make way for the new complex. The North and South Wing Buildings were completed in December 1977. Meanwhile, the Main Building itself finally opened on May 31, 1978.PhilSTAR.com: Philippine architecture in the 1950s by Paulo Alcazaren However, the rest of the intended government buildings and public spaces around the complex were never built. The legislative body first convened at the Main Building on June 12, 1978.House of Representatives of the Philippines - The Official Buildings of the House of Representatives - www.congress.gov.ph Turned over to the House of Representatives However, under the 1987 constitution, the legislative branch again became bicameral. The numerically larger House of Representatives retained the session hall and offices of the old Batasang Pambansa on the grounds of the complex. The smaller, newly reinstated Senate returned to the original legislative building in Manila (reinstated as capital city in 1976) and held their plenary sessions there until the building was turned over to the National Museum of the Philippines under the presidency of Fidel V. Ramos. The Senate has since moved to the GSIS Building on reclaimed land on Manila Bay in Pasay, holding their plenary sessions there since May 1997. Expansion Apart from designing the core buildings of the complex, Felipe M. Mendoza and his office also allotted a master plan for possible expansion of the complex. These included: #A Senate Building, containing the Senate Session Hall and Offices, on the open area at the eastern side of the Main Building #The Library of Congress, Museum, and Archives on the western side of the complex #Several other ancillary buildings Plans and scale models for the expansion were developed in 1978, but were not implemented. In March 2001, the Ramon V. Mitra Jr. Building was completed. Currently headquartered in the building are the Legislative Library, the Committee offices, the Reference and Research Bureau, and the Conference Rooms. The South Wing Annex Building started construction in 2008 and was inaugurated on June 29, 2010.House of Representatives of the Philippines - Press Releases: Nograles leads new House Annex inauguration - www.congress.gov.ph Interior=Session Hall The Session Hall. Members of the House of Representatives hold their plenary sessions at the Session Hall, located inside the Main Building. Comprising 200+ members elected by first past the post and 50+ members elected by closed party list, the legislators debate economic, social and other issues inside the complex. The Session Hall is also used for joint sessions of the Congress of the Philippines, such as election results, confirmation meetings, and addresses by the President of the Philippines or other guests of honor. The President's annual State of the Nation Address delivered to a joint session of Congress is one example of such a speech. The Session Hall has a seating capacity for about 1,500 people.

Chariots also allowed military commanders a mobile platform from which to control troops while providing archers and soldiers armed with dagger-axes increased mobility. They reached a peak of importance during the Spring and Autumn period, but were largely superseded by cavalry during the Han Dynasty. History Qin dynasty chariot from the Terracotta Army Traditional sources attribute the invention of the chariot to the Xia dynasty minister Xi Zhong,Xu Shen, Shuowen JieziYupian Chariot Section (ËΩ¶ÈÉ®)Shiben¬∑ Zuo Pian (‰ΩúÁØá) and say they were used at the Battle of Gan (Áîò‰πãÊàò) in the 21st century BCE. However archeological evidence shows that small scale use of the chariot began around 1200 BCE in the late Shang dynasty.Beckwith, 43 This corroborates the material spread of the invention from the Eurasian Grass-Steppe to the West, by Proto- Indo-Europeans (likely the Tocharians) who similarly have borne horse, agricultural, and honey making technologies through the Tarim Basin into China. Contemporary oracle bone inscriptions of the character depict a chariot-like two wheeled vehicle with a single pole for the attachment of horses. Chariots reached their apogee and remained a powerful weapon until the end of the Warring States Period (471‚Äì221 BCE) when increasing use of the crossbow, massed infantry, the adoption of standard cavalry units and the adaptation of nomadic cavalry (mounted archery) took over. Chariots continued to serve as command posts for officers during the Qin and Han Dynasties while armored chariots were also used by the Han Dynasty against the Xiongnu Confederation in the Han‚ÄìXiongnu War, specifically at the Battle of Mobei in 119 CE. General Wei Qing's army, setting off from Dingxiang, encountered the Xiongnu Chanyu's army of 80,000 cavalry. Wei Qing ordered his troops to arrange heavy-armoured chariots in a ring formation, creating mobile fortresses. With changes in the nature of warfare, as well as the increasing availability of larger breeds of horses, during the Qin and Han Dynasties (221 BCE ‚Äì 220 CE) the chariot was replaced by cavalry and infantry, and the single-pole chariot became less important. At this time the double shaft chariot developed as a transport vehicle which was light and easy to handle. During the Eastern Han (25‚Äì220 CE) and later during the Three Kingdoms Period (220‚Äì280 CE), the double shaft chariot was the predominant form. This change is seen in innumerable Han Dynasty stone carvings and in many ceramic tomb models. Over time, as society evolved, the early chariot of the Pre-Qin period gradually disappeared. Construction Powerful landlord in chariot. Eastern Han 25‚Äì220 CE. Anping, Hebei. Ancient Chinese chariots were typically two wheeled vehicles drawn by two or four horses p51 with a single draught pole measuring around 3 m long that was originally straight but later evolved into two curved shafts. At the front end of the pole there was a horizontal draw- bar about one meter long with wooden yokes attached, to which the horses would be harnessed. Wooden wheels with a diameter of between approximately 1.2 ‚Äì 1.4 m were mounted on a axle and secured at each end with a bronze hubcap. Wheels of the Shang period usually had 18 spokes, but those of the Zhou period numbered from 18 to 26. Chariot wheels of the Spring and Autumn period (8th‚Äì7th century BCE) had between 25 and 28 spokes. The carriage body was around one meter long and 0.8 meters wide with wooden walls and an opening at the back to provide access for soldiers. With the arrival of the Spring and Autumn period (771‚Äì476 BCE) improvements had been made to the chariot's design and construction. The angle of the curved draw pole had increased raising the end of the pole. This reduced the amount of effort required by the horse pulling the chariot and increased its speed. The width of the carriage body had also increased to around 1.5 m allowing soldiers greater freedom of movement. Key components such as the pole, hubcap and yoke were reinforced with decorated copper castings, increasing the chariot's stability and durability. These chariots were variously referred to as \\"gold chariots\\" (ÈáëËΩ¶), \\"attack chariots\\" (ÊîªËΩ¶) or \\"weapons chariots\\" (ÊàéËΩ¶). The Chinese war chariot, like the other war chariots of Eurasia, derived its characteristic ability to perform at high speed by a combination of a light design, together with a propulsion system using horses, which were the fastest draft animals available.Beckwith, 53 (note: although Beckwith is making a general statement about war chariots in general, this also is explicitly tied to the Chinese war chariot elsewhere in the text) Crew and weaponry Scythed Chinese chariot axle Usually a chariot carried three armored warriors with different tasks: one, known as the charioteer (Âæ°ËÄÖ) was responsible for driving, a second, the archer (Â∞Ñ) (or sometimes multiple archers (Â§öÂ∞Ñ)) tasked with long range shooting. The r√≥ngy√≤u (ÊàéÂè≥), whose role was short range defence, made up the third member of the crew. Weapons carried on the chariot consisted of close- combat and long range weapons. The most important close-combat weapon aboard the chariot was the dagger-axe or gƒì (Êàà), a weapon with a roughly three-meter shaft. At the end of the double-headed device there was a sharp dagger on one side and an axe head on the other. This was carried by the r√≥ngy√≤u and could be either swung or thrust like a spear at the enemy. By the time of the Spring and Autumn Period the gƒì had largely been superseded by the halberd or jƒ≠ (Êàü) which had a spear blade at the end of the shaft in addition to the axe head and dagger. All chariot commanders carried a bronze dagger for protection in the case of the chariot becoming unserviceable or an enemy jumping on board the chariot. Soldiers aboard wore leather or occasionally copper armour and carried a shield or d√πn (Áõæ) made from leather or bronze. The chariot's archer was armed either a bow (g≈çng Âºì) or crossbow (n≈≠ Âº©) for long distance attacks. Chariot horses also began to wear armor during the Spring and Autumn Period to protect against injury. When the chariot was not engaged in a military campaign it was used as a transport vehicle. Operational deployment The chariot was a large military vehicle that through its lack of flexibility was not effective as a single combat unit. Usually its commander would be allocated a number of infantrymen or t√∫ z√π (ÂæíÂçí) to co-operate in battle. During the Western Zhou era, ten infantry were usually allocated to each chariot with five of them riding on the chariot, each of which was called a squadron (du√¨ Èöä/Èòü). Five squadrons made up a zh√®ngpiƒÅn (Ê≠£ÂÅè), four zh√®ngpiƒÅn formed a division (shƒ´ Â∏à) while five divisions were known as an army (j≈´n ÂÜõ). In the Spring and Autumn Period the chariot became the main weapon of war. Along with each state's increase in military manpower, their proportion of chariots to overall army numbers also fell with the number of men allocated to each chariot increasing to seventy. This alteration fundamentally changed the fundamentals of warfare. Combat and tactical disposition Scythed Chinese chariot axle In ancient China the chariot was used in a primary role from the time of the Shang Dynasty until the early years of the Han Dynasty (c. 1200‚Äì200 BCE) when it was replaced by cavalry and fell back into a secondary support role. For a millennium or more, every chariot borne soldier had used the particular combat tactics that use of the vehicle required. Chariot-based combat usually took place in wide-open spaces. When the two sides were within range they would first exchange arrow or crossbow fire, hoping that through superior numbers they would cause disorder and confusion in the enemy ranks. As the two opponents closed on each other they would stay about four meters apart to avoid the dagger-axes of their opponents. Only when two chariots came closer than this would an actual fight occur. Only about three meters wide, with infantry riding on both sides, the chariot was highly inflexible as a fighting machine and difficult to turn around. Coupled with this were restrictions on the use of weapons with opponents seizing the momentary opportunity for victory or trapping their opponent with a pincer movement. These tactics required fighting in tight formation with good military discipline and control. When the spring and autumn period began, more attention was paid to troop formations according to the type of battle. Chariot units were trained to ensure co-ordination with the rest of the army during a military campaign. During the Western Zhou Era, chariots were deployed on wide-open plains abreast of each other in a single line. The accompanying infantry would then be deployed forward of the chariot, a broad formation that denied the enemy the opportunity for pincer attacks. When the two sides clashed, if the chariots remained in strict formation there would be a good opportunity to encircle the enemy. During this period of chariot warfare, the use of orderly team-based combat to some extent determined the difference between victory and defeat, otherwise fighting would have to stop in order to consolidate the formation. In this type operation unified command was important. Senior officers would use drums and flags to command the army's advance and retreat, speed and to make formation adjustments. However such operations were inherently very slow-paced and the speed of engagement thus hampered. Furthermore, the infantry had to remain in line which was not conducive to long-distance pursuits of retreating enemies. A typical example of the importance of disciplined forces occurred during the Zhou overthrow of Shang at the decisive Battle of Muye in 1046 BCE. As the Zhou army moved forward, the infantry and chariots were commanded to stop and regroup after every six or seven steps to maintain formation. The Shang army, despite its superior numbers, was largely composed of demoralized and forcibly conscripted troops. As a result, the troops failed to stay in formation and were defeated. As the Spring and Autumn period dawned, chariots remained the key to victory. At the Battle of Yanling in 575 BCE between the States of Chu and Jin the disorganised nature of the Chu army's chariots and infantry led to its defeat. Both troop formations and the flexibility of the chariot subsequently underwent major developments with infantry placing a much larger role in combat. Troops were no longer deployed forward of chariots but instead around all four sides thereby increasing the vehicle's flexibility. Formations no longer involved a single line of chariots; instead they were spread out which brought the advantage of depth. In this way the chariot's movement was no longer impeded so it could counter enemy attacks as well as provide a fast pursuit vehicle.

Shea was the named plaintiff in the landmark First Amendment case, Shea v Reno, which ended with the Communications Decency Act and its proposed censorship of the Internet declared unconstitutional in Manhattan Federal Court and affirmed in the U. S. Supreme Court in 1997. He is a noted community activist whose efforts to clean up a dangerous neighborhood in Hollywood, California were praised by authorities as a national model for Neighborhood Watch. His defiance of the Clinton Administration on the censorship law was featured in \\"A Day In the Life of The Internet\\". Shea was born in Goshen, New York, to Mr. & Mrs. John S. Shea, Jr., of Monroe and New York City. His grandfather John S. Shea was elected Sheriff of New York in 1909, the first Republican to be elected in Manhattan since Reconstruction and the last until his uncle, William F. Shea, was elected to the bench in 1954. Joe Shea also started the Committee to Draft U.S. Senator John Kerry which sought to get the Massachusetts senator into the 1988 Presidential race. Journalism Joe Shea started out in journalism by covering the riots in Harlem on the night Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. died and submitted his first article in longhand to the Village Voice where it was selected by editor Ross Wetzsteon over 18 other submissions from New Left luminaries including Dave Dellinger and Michael Harrington. He worked for the Village Voice as a freelance war correspondent in Northern Ireland, India, Vietnam and the Philippines, and was responsible in 1976 for the withdrawal of President Gerald Ford's nomination of Patrick Delaney to the Securities Exchange Commission after the Village Voice published his article revealing inconsistencies in Delaney's resume. Shea also wrote an article linking Nelson Rockefeller, then Governor of New York, to a Bolivian diplomat, Victor Andrade, whom the U.S. Office of Strategic Services had identified as a \\"front for Nazis\\" in the cabinet of Bolivian President Paz Estenssoro. He later worked on the staff at Esquire Magazine, where he was responsible for a suggestion that became a regular feature of the magazine called \\"Reckless Advice\\", which became a book by Lee Eisenberg. Shea rolled a coin across his fingers on both hands while tap- dancing and singing \\"The Impossible Dream\\" on the Gong Show in 1978, and also wrote about the experience for the Village Voice. His most important investigative article was a cover story for the L.A. Weekly in Nov., 1989, describing the large influx of monied Iranians into Beverly Hills, where they altered the economic and sociocultural underpinnings of one of the world's wealthiest cities. In a Village Voice article, \\"Are Delaney & Son A New Washington Partnership?\\", Shea told of an extensive stock fraud in which President Gerald Ford's nominee to the Securities Exchange Commission was involved. Patrick Delaney was the son of the ranking bipartisan-endorsed member of the House Rules Committee, Rep. John Delaney. The article exposed the pair's profit from the fraud and that the younger Delaney had lied about a degree from Georgetown. The article led to the withdrawal of Delaney's nomination, and the elder Delaney, who admitted to Shea that he \\"may have\\" made $100,000 in the Westec stock fraud, chose not to run for office again. His seat was won by Geraldine Ferraro, who became the first major-party female nominee for vice president just two years later. The article had the effect of preventing the appointment of an SEC member who might be open to blackmail and of producing a vacancy that was filled by a history-making candidate. In addition, he wrote for Bert Sugar's Argosy Magazine and many other publications, including the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle and Los Angeles Daily News, where he contributed op-ed articles. He was the executive speech writer consultant at Lockheed Corp. in 1977 as the company sought to make the $800-million \\"Deal of the Century\\" for the L1011 passenger jet with Pan Am. He wrote three speeches, including one broadcast nationally on Town Hall and one to the American Society of Financial Analysts for Lockheed Chairman Roy Anderson, and one for Lockheed President Larry Kitchen, an address to the National Aeronautic Association. The sale of the L10ll to Pan Am saved the company. Activism As a community activist, Joe Shea served for 13 years as president of the Ivar Hill Community Association and was the subject of numerous television documentaries by Fox News and CNN, among others. The association provided fresh meals and hand-wrapped Christmas gifts for more than 7,000 of Hollywood's poorest children during his years as president. He appeared frequently on television as a community leader and was frequently quoted in the Los Angeles Times during his 10-year effort as leader of the Ivar Hawks Neighborhood Watch to reduce the high rate of violent crime in Hollywood during the 1990s. LAPD officials hailed the group as a \\"national model\\" for Neighborhood Watch and credited the group with at least 16 citizen's arrests of drug dealers. In 2001, Shea was hailed for his leadership by Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks in an LAPD press release. In addition, Shea was a leading member of the group that put Hollywood's secession on the 2001 Los Angeles city ballot, and was a candidate for the proposed city's city council whose eloquent speech to the county Board of Supervisors in support of cityhood was aired on National Public Radio. In addition, Shea ran in 2000 as a candidate for Mayor of Los Angeles supporting the secession movement. Writing and acting Joe's collection of Shakespearean sonnets, \\"A Native Music\\", was published in 1989, and he appeared at the Zephyr Theater in Los Angeles for a three-week run reading a selection of them. He won the Greater Los Angeles Press Club's First Prize for the Best Internet News Story of 2000, in which he revealed the inside secrets of a pyramid scheme and was instrumental in securing seven no-contest pleas from perpetrators of the infamous multimillion-dollar \\"Family & Friends\\" fraud. Shea appeared as The Tourist in the original Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Robert Wilson's 12-hour opera, \\"The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin\\", in 1976.

As well as Morrissey, the series also stars Aidan Gillen, Eddie Marsan, O-T Fagbenle and Lorraine Ashbourne in supporting roles. The series comprises two three-part dramatisations of the first two Thorne novels, Sleepyhead and Scaredycat. Sleepyhead, directed by Stephen Hopkins, previewed in full at the BFI Southbank in London on 4 October 2010, followed by a Q&A; session featuring writer Mark Billingham and actors David Morrissey and Eddie Marsan.BFI, 4 October 2010, TV preview: thorne: sleepyhead + Q&A; Although directly adapted from the novels, there are many notable differences in the series, including; Brigstocke's sex has been changed; Dave Holland's ethnicity has been changed; and Phil Hendricks is portrayed as a short, partly tattooed Irishman with a full head of hair, a juxtaposition of the tall, bald, heavily pierced, heavily tattooed Mancunian described in Billingham's novels. In the United States, Encore broadcast all six episodes of the series across two nights. Sleepyhead and Scaredycat aired on 12 and 13 June 2012 respectively. The series is also available as a complete box set on Netflix. All six episodes were released on Region 2 DVD and Blu-ray on 10 January 2011. Production Prior to filming, Morrissey commented on how he became involved with the role: \\"I was doing a film in New Zealand, on my own, in winter. I really needed a book. I stumbled across a Thorne novel, liked it, and then I looked up Mark online and found a question-and-answer session where he said that if his books ever made it to the screen, he‚Äôd like me to play the lead. I thought, that‚Äôs a good start\\".Ed Cumming, 8 October 2010, The Daily Telegraph, David Morrissey on Thorne: a British copper, in a US style The first two novels adapted for the series were Sleepyhead, in which Thorne has to track down and stop a serial killer who aims to leave his victims alive but unable to communicate because of locked-in syndrome; and Scaredy Cat, in which two serial killers, Martin Palmer and Stuart Nicklin, begin to work in tandem to pick off their victims. Billingham later expressed a desire to film all ten Thorne novels. Likewise, Morrissey confirmed in February 2011 that a second series had gone into production.BBC, 4 February 2011, South Riding ‚Äì David Morrissey is Robert Carne However, in a newsletter issued to members of his mailing list in December 2012, Billingham stated that Morrissey's role in The Walking Dead had suspended plans for any further series.

This is achieved with urgent hospitalization and medical therapy, including drugs that relieve chest pain and reduce the size of the infarct, and drugs that inhibit clot formation; for a subset of patients invasive measures are also employed (coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention). Basic principles of management are the same for all types of acute coronary syndrome. However, some important aspects of treatment depend on the presence or absence of elevation of the ST segment on the electrocardiogram, which classifies cases upon presentation to either ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NST-ACS); the latter includes unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Treatment is generally more aggressive for STEMI patients, and reperfusion therapy is more often reserved for them. Long-term therapy is necessary for prevention of recurrent events and complications.Current management of acute coronary syndrome is based on guidelines, produced by national and international medical societies according to the principles of evidence-based medicine. Examples are the guidelines of the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (, ) and those of the European Society of Cardiology (, ).  General principles  Acute coronary syndromes are commonly caused by a blood clot forming on an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery. Oxygen delivery to a part of heart muscle is blocked, eventually causing cell death. Acute coronary syndromes are caused by sudden and critical reduction of blood flow in one of the coronary arteries, the vessels that supply oxygenated blood to the myocardium (heart muscle), typically by a blood clot. The principal symptom is typically chest pain, known as angina pectoris; people who present with angina must prompt evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome. Acute coronary syndromes are classified to two major categories, according to the patient's electrocardiogram, and specifically the presence or absence of persistent (>20 min) ST segment elevation (or left bundle branch block). Patients with acute coronary syndrome and ST elevation are said to suffer from ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and they tend to have one of their coronary arteries totally blocked., p. 1092 Damage is reversible for approximately 20-30. Cited in minutes after complete obstruction of blood flow; thereafter myocardial cell death ensues and progresses as time passes. Therefore, complete and sustained restoration of blood flow must be as prompt as possible to ensure maximum salvage of functional myocardium, a principle expressed in the maxim \\"time is muscle\\".See: * * This is achieved with reperfusion therapy, which is based on invasive reopening of the afflicted coronary artery with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, or non-invasive breaking up of the responsible blood clot with a thrombolytic drug. Patients without ST segment elevation are said to suffer from non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome and tend not to have full occlusion of a coronary artery. If there is evidence of myocardial cell death (especially elevated cardiac biomarkers) they are considered to have a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI); otherwise they are classified as suffering from unstable angina. Their management is based on the estimation of their risk for adverse events. Patients at low risk can be adequately treated with medical therapy, in many ways similar to the one used for STEMI (but excluding thrombolytics). Those at moderate to high risk benefit from an early invasive strategy, which includes coronary angiography and, if necessary, revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery. Medical therapy for acute coronary syndromes is based on drugs that act against ischemia and resultant angina and limit the infarct size (i.e., the area of myocardium that is affected), as well as drugs that inhibit clot formation. The latter include antiplatelet agents, which block the activation and aggregation of platelets (cellular blood components that contribute to clot formation), and anticoagulant agents (which attenuate the coagulation cascade). Long-term therapy in acute coronary syndrome survivors is targeted against recurrence and long-term complications (secondary prevention). Women are taken less seriously than men when they have a heart attack leading to higher mortality among women.Heart attack care dangerously unequal for women, study finds BBC  Patient-dependent initial measures  Information card published by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute urging people with symptoms of angina to call the emergency medical services.Because of the relationship between the duration of myocardial ischemia and the extent of damage to heart muscle, public health services encourage people experiencing possible acute coronary syndrome symptoms or those around them to immediately call emergency medical services. Patients with known coronary artery disease who have been prescribed nitroglycerin should promptly take one dose, and call emergency medical services if their symptoms do not improve within 2‚Äì5 minutes. Patients should not be transported to hospital by private vehicles instead of an ambulance, unless evacuation by land or air ambulance is impossible (e.g., dangerous weather in a very remote area), and if they must be, it should be done if possible with someone trained in cardiac first aid. Chewing non‚àíenteric-coated aspirin is encouraged (unless there are contraindications). Health care professionals are responsible for teaching their patients at risk of acute coronary syndrome what the symptoms of this condition are, and that it is imperative to seek urgent medical attention in case they present. Emergency services Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems vary considerably in their ability to evaluate and treat patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. Some provide as little as first aid and early defibrillation. Others employ highly trained paramedics with sophisticated technology and advanced protocols. Paramedic services are capable of providing oxygen, IV access, sublingual nitroglycerine, morphine, and aspirin. Some advanced paramedic systems can also perform 12-lead ECGs.Alberta Occupational Competency Profile EMT Paramedic . Alberta College Of Paramedics. Updated January 2007, Retrieved June 29, 2011. If a STEMI is recognized the paramedic may be able to contact the local PCI hospital and alert the emergency room physician, and staff of the suspected AMI. Some Paramedic services are capable of providing thrombolytic therapy in the prehospital setting, allowing reperfusion of the myocardium. With primary PCI emerging as the preferred therapy for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, EMS can play a key role in reducing door-to-balloon intervals (the time from presentation to a hospital ER to the restoration of coronary artery blood flow) by performing a 12-lead ECG in the field and using this information to triage the patient to the most appropriate medical facility.T In addition, the 12-lead ECG can be transmitted to the receiving hospital, which enables time saving decisions to be made prior to the arrival of the patient. This may include a \\"cardiac alert\\" or \\"STEMI alert\\" that calls in off duty personnel in areas where the cardiac cath lab is not staffed 24 hours a day.Rokos I. and Bouthillet T., \\"The emergency medical systems-to-balloon (E2B) challenge: building on the foundations of the D2B Alliance,\\" STEMI Systems, Issue Two, May 2007. Accessed June 16, 2007. Even in the absence of a formal alerting program, prehospital 12-lead ECGs are independently associated with reduced door to treatment intervals in the emergency department.  Initial diagnostic approach  Typical electrocardiogram of an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. ST elevation in leads I, aVL and V1-V5 indicates an anterior wall myocardial infarction and is shown in orange; reciprocal ST depression in leads II, III and aVF is shown in blue.In patients with symptoms typical of myocardial ischemia an electrocardiogram must be immediately obtained - e.g., within 10 minutes from first contact with medical or paramedical personnel, including prehospital setting; the electrocardiographic findings will guide the subsequent management. Patients with elevation of the ST segment (or presumed new left bundle branch block) are treated based on guidelines for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and must undergo reperfusion therapy as soon as possible. Serum cardiac biomarkers are routinely obtained and their elevation is necessary for confirming diagnosis of myocardial infarction;p. 2553 however, reperfusion must not be delayed by waiting for the results. Patients without the above findings are initially classified as suffering from non ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, and subsequent cardiac biomarker results will differentiate between true non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina.  Relief of angina  Relief of the pain of angina is of paramount importance, not only for humane reasons but because the pain is associated with sympathetic activation that causes vasoconstriction and increases the workload of the heart. The pain of myocardial ischemia is likely to respond to any intervention that improves the relationship between oxygen demand and supply, like nitrates, beta blockers and oxygen.  Nitrates  Nitrates, like nitroglycerin, dilate blood vessels, which is beneficial against myocardial ischemia in two ways: By increasing blood flow in the coronary arteries and the amount of oxygen that arrives to heart muscle; and by relaxing all blood vessels in the body, thereby reducing the workload that heart needs to produce against them and the oxygen it consumes. The preferred mode of administration is sublingually. By relaxing blood vessels nitrates also reduce blood pressure, which must be carefully monitored; they must not be used if hypotension is present. They must also be avoided in patients who have taken sildenafil or other phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (used for erectile dysfunction) within the previous 24‚Äì48 hours, as the combination of the two could cause a serious drop in blood pressure. Intravenous nitrates are useful in patients with hypertension or pulmonary edema.  Beta blockers  By reducing sympathetic stimulation of the heart, beta blockers decrease heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac output, and hence heart oxygen consumption. Beta-blockers alleviate ischemic pain, and have also been proved to reduce the size of infarcted heart muscle, the risk of arrhythmias, and the proportion of patients with acute coronary syndrome who actually evolve STEMI. However, they have also been shown to increase the risk of acute heart failure. Their early use is contraindicated if there are signs of congestive heart failure (e.g., Killip class II or above) or hypotension, along with other contraindications to beta blockers (slow heart rate, atrioventricular block); in the absence of contraindications beta blocker therapy should begin in the first 24 hours. It may be prudent to prefer oral rather than intravenous forms.See:  * *  Oxygen therapy  Initial administration of oxygen to all patients with acute coronary syndrome is common practice; however, there is no evidence to support or refute that supplemental oxygen might be harmful or beneficial for cardiac patients who do not need it. It is currently recommended to give oxygen only to breathless patients or when blood oxygen saturation is low, e.g. <90%.  Analgesics  Analgesic agents that are most commonly used are opioids, and especially morphine, which is considered the analgesic of choice in patients with ST elevation. Along with its pain-controlling properties, morphine also reduces the work of breathing, alleviates breathlessness, reduces anxiety and has favorable action on hemodynamic parameters and cardiac oxygen consumption. However, in patients presenting without ST elevation, morphine has been shown to have adverse events potential, and its use is considered acceptable only after inadequate pain relief by medication specific against angina. Non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated for both categories of patients.  Antiplatelet drugs All patients with acute coronary syndrome must immediately receive antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin and generally a second oral antiplatelet agent. Bleeding is the most important side-effect of antiplatelets.  Aspirin  Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation and formation of blood clots. It is effective across the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes, and it actually has been shown to reduce the rate of death in patients with STEMI and in patients presenting without ST elevation. Aspirin is contraindicated in patients with documented allergy or known platelet disorder. Patients who have had gastrointestinal symptoms while on long-term aspirin therapy are usually able to tolerate aspirin in the short term. For patients with true intolerance to aspirin clopidogrel is recommended. Lower doses need days to achieve full antiplatelet effect, therefore a loading dose is necessary for patients who are not already on aspirin.See:    P2Y12 inhibitors  Aside from aspirin, three antiplatelet agents taken by mouth have been approved for use in acute coronary syndromes, clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel; all reduce platelet aggregation by inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor, a type of adenosine phosphate receptor, on the surface of platelets. Not all three of them are equally indicated in all types of acute coronary syndromes. In patients with ST elevation the choice of P2Y12 inhibitor depends on reperfusion strategy; for patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention ticagrelor and prasugrel are considered superior to clopidogrel, as they are more potent and have more rapid onset of action, at the cost of some increase in bleeding risk; for STEMI patients who are treated with fibrinolysis and those who do not undergo reperfusion treatment only clopidogrel is indicated. Prasugrel must not be given to patients with a history of ischemic stroke or aged 75 years or older. In patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome current guidelines also recommend immediate administration of dual antiplatelet therapy upon diagnosis; clopidogrel and ticagrelor are indicated in this setting, with ticagrelor considered superior for patients undergoing early invasive strategy (see later). However, emerging evidence questions this strategy. As with aspirin, it is necessary to administer a loading dose.  Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors  Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are a class of intravenous antiplatelet agents used in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, consisting of abciximab, eptifibatide and tirofiban. Patients presenting with ST elevation that will be reperfused with percutaneous coronary intervention may receive one of the above agents at the time of catheterization, or perhaps before. Administering eptifibatide or tirofiban may also be reasonable in patients presenting with NST-ACS who are considered of intermediate or high risk and are treated with early invasive strategy. Anticoagulants Anticoagulants in acute coronary syndrome are targeted against the coronary blood clot, as well as towards prevention of thrombotic complications, like formation of blood clots in the ventricles, stroke, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. Patients undergoing PCI also need an anticoagulant to prevent catheter thrombosis. Options include unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin (a low molecular weight heparin), fondaparinux (a pentasaccharide antagonist of factor Xa) and bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor); all the above agents are given parenterally (subcutaneously or intravenously). Unfractionated heparin has the disadvantage of requiring dose adjustment based on a laboratory exam, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). In STEMI patients choice depends on the reperfusion strategy used (see below); bivalirudin is used when PCI is employed only, while in the same case fondaparinux is not preferred. Similarly, in Non-STE ACS bivalirudin too is only used when an early invasive strategy is chosen. Reperfusion The concept of reperfusion has become so central to the modern treatment of acute myocardial infarction, that we are said to be in the reperfusion era. Patients who present with suspected acute myocardial infarction and ST segment elevation (STEMI) or new bundle branch block on the 12 lead ECG are presumed to have an occlusive thrombosis in an epicardial coronary artery. They are therefore candidates for immediate reperfusion, either with thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or when these therapies are unsuccessful, bypass surgery. Individuals without ST segment elevation are presumed to be experiencing either unstable angina (UA) or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). They receive many of the same initial therapies and are often stabilized with antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulated. If their condition remains (hemodynamically) stable, they can be offered either late coronary angiography with subsequent restoration of blood flow (revascularization), or non-invasive stress testing to determine if there is significant ischemia that would benefit from revascularization. If hemodynamic instability develops in individuals with NSTEMIs, they may undergo urgent coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization. The use of thrombolytic agents is contraindicated in this patient subset, however. The basis for this distinction in treatment regimens is that ST segment elevations on an ECG are typically due to complete occlusion of a coronary artery. On the other hand, in NSTEMIs there is typically a sudden narrowing of a coronary artery with preserved (but diminished) flow to the distal myocardium. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are given to prevent the narrowed artery from occluding. At least 10% of patients with STEMI do not develop myocardial necrosis (as evidenced by a rise in cardiac markers) and subsequent Q waves on EKG after reperfusion therapy. Such a successful restoration of flow to the infarct- related artery during an acute myocardial infarction is known as \\"aborting\\" the myocardial infarction. If treated within the hour, about 25% of STEMIs can be aborted. Rehabilitation Additional objectives are to prevent life- threatening arrhythmias or conduction disturbances. This requires monitoring in a coronary care unit and protocolized administration of antiarrhythmic agents. Antiarrhythmic agents are typically only given to individuals with life-threatening arrhythmias after a myocardial infarction and not to suppress the ventricular ectopy that is often seen after a myocardial infarction. Cardiac rehabilitation aims to optimize function and quality of life in those afflicted with a heart disease. This can be with the help of a physician, or in the form of a cardiac rehabilitation program.Life after a Heart Attack. U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Retrieved December 2, 2006. Physical exercise is an important part of rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction, with beneficial effects on cholesterol levels, blood pressure, weight, stress and mood. Some patients become afraid of exercising because it might trigger another infarct.Trisha Macnair. Recovering after a heart attack. BBC, December 2005. Retrieved December 2, 2006. Patients are encouraged to exercise, and should only avoid certain exerting activities. Local authorities may place limitations on driving motor vehicles. In most cases, the advice is a gradual increase in physical exercise during about 6‚Äì8 weeks following an MI. If it doesn't feel too hard for the patient, the advice about exercise is then the same as applies to anyone else to gain health benefits, that is, at least 20‚Äì30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days (at least five days per week) to the extent of getting slightly short of breath.Patient UK > After a Myocardial Infarction Reviewed: 19 May 2010 Some people are afraid to have sex after a heart attack. Most people can resume sexual activities after 3 to 4 weeks. The amount of activity needs to be dosed to the patient's possibilities.\\"Heart Attack: Getting Back Into Your Life After a Heart Attack \\". American Academy of Family Physicians, updated March 2005. Retrieved December 4, 2006. Special cases=Cocaine Cocaine associated myocardial infarction should be managed in a manner similar to other patients with acute coronary syndrome, except that beta blockers should not be used and benzodiazepines should be administered early. The treatment itself may have complications. If attempts to restore the blood flow are initiated after a critical period of only a few hours, the result may be a reperfusion injury instead of amelioration. Wilderness setting In wilderness first aid, a possible heart attack justifies evacuation by the fastest available means, often meaning the initiation of a MEDEVAC. The suspicion or provisional diagnosis of an MI means that it is inappropriate for the patient to walk out of the wilderness setting and will require them to be carried or conveyed in a vehicle. Aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen can all be given with relative ease in a wilderness setting and should be administered as soon as possible in suspected cases of MI. Wilderness management of cardiac arrest differs slightly from that carried out in an urban setting in that it is generally considered acceptable to terminate a resuscitation attempt after 30 minutes if there has been no change in the patient's condition. Air travel Certified personnel traveling by commercial aircraft may be able to assist an MI patient by using the on-board first aid kit, which may contain some cardiac drugs (such as glyceryl trinitrate spray, aspirin, or opioid painkillers), an AED, and oxygen. Pilots may divert the flight to land at a nearby airport. Cardiac monitors are being introduced by some airlines, and they can be used by both on-board and ground-based physicians.

Overview Adam Smith was one of the first influential writers on the topic with his book The Wealth of Nations, which is generally considered to be the start of classical economics which emerged in the 18th century. To the contrary, Karl Marx considered capitalism to be a historically specific mode of production and considered capitalism a phase of economic development that would pass and be replaced by pure communism. In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that exploited labor would be the driving force behind a social revolution to a socialist-style economy.Wheen, Francis Books That Shook the World: Marx's Das Kapital. 1st ed. London: Atlantic Books, 2006 For Marx, this cycle of the extraction of the surplus value by the owners of capital or the bourgeoisie becomes the basis of class struggle. This argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the labor theory of value asserting that labor is the source of all value and thus of profit. Max Weber considered market exchange rather than production as the defining feature of capitalism. In contrast to their counterparts in prior modes of economic activity, capitalist enterprises was their rationalization of production, directed toward maximizing efficiency and productivity; a tendency leading to a sociological process of enveloping rationalization. According to Weber, workers in pre-capitalist economic institutions understood work in terms of a personal relationship between master and journeyman in a guild, or between lord and peasant in a manor. Meanwhile institutional economics, once the main school of economic thought in the United States, holds that capitalism cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded. In the late 19th century, the German Historical School of economics diverged with the emerging Austrian School of economics, led at the time by Carl Menger. Later generations of followers of the Austrian School continued to be influential in Western economic thought through much of the 20th century. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a forerunner of the Austrian School of economics, emphasized the creative destruction of capitalism‚Äîthe fact that market economies undergo constant change. The Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek were among the leading defenders of market economy against 20th century proponents of socialist planned economies. Among Mises's arguments were the economic calculation problem, which was first proposed by Mises in 1920 and later expounded by Hayek.F. A. Hayek, (1935), \\"The Nature and History of the Problem\\" and \\"The Present State of the Debate,\\" in F. A. Hayek, ed. Collectivist Economic Planning, pp. 1‚Äì40, 201‚Äì43. The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources rationally in an economy. The free market solution is the price mechanism, wherein people individually have the ability to decide how a good or service should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for it. Mises and Hayek argued that only market capitalism could manage a complex, modern economy. Partially opposed to that view, the British economist John Maynard Keynes argued in his 1937 The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money that capitalism suffered a basic problem in its ability to recover from periods of slowdowns in investment. Keynes argued that a capitalist economy could remain in an indefinite equilibrium despite high unemployment. Keynes tried to provide solutions to many of Marx‚Äôs problems without completely abandoning the classical understanding of capitalism. His work attempted to show that regulation can be effective and that economic stabilizers can rein in the aggressive expansions and recessions that Marx disliked. These changes sought to create more stability in the business cycle and reduce the abuses of laborers. Keynesian economists argue that Keynesian policies were one of the primary reasons capitalism was able to recover following the Great Depression.Erhardt III, Erwin. \\"History of Economic Development.\\" University of Cincinnati. Lindner Center Auditorium, Cincinnati. 7 Nov. 2008. Supply-side economics developed during the 1970s in response to Keynesian economic policy and in particular the failure of demand management to stabilize Western economies during the stagflation of the 1970s in the wake of the oil crisis in 1973.Case, Karl E. & Fair, Ray C. (1999). Principles of Economics (5th ed.), p. 780. Prentice-Hall. . It drew on a range of non-Keynesian economic thought, particularly Austrian School thinking on entrepreneurship and new classical macroeconomics. The intellectual roots of supply-side economics have also been traced back to various early economic thinkers such as Ibn Khaldun, Jonathan Swift, David Hume, Adam Smith and Alexander Hamilton. Typical policy recommendations of supply-side economics are lower marginal tax rates and less regulation. Maximum benefits from taxation policy are achieved by optimizing the marginal tax rates to spur growth, although it is a common misunderstanding that supply side economics is concerned only with taxation policy when it is about removing barriers to production more generally. Today, the majority academic research on capitalism in the English-speaking world draws on neoclassical economic thought. It favors extensive market coordination and relatively neutral patterns of governmental market regulation aimed at maintaining property rights; deregulated labor markets; corporate governance dominated by financial owners of firms; and financial systems depending chiefly on capital market-based financing rather than state financing. Milton Friedman took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and gave them a new twist. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of The New York Times, where he claims that the social responsibility of business is \\"to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits‚Ä¶(through) open and free competition without deception or fraud\\". This is similar to Smith‚Äôs argument that self-interest in turn benefits the whole of society.Friedman, Milton. \\"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits.\\" The New York Times Magazine 13 Sep. 1970. Work like this helped lay the foundations for the coming marketization (or privatization) of state enterprises and the supply-side economics of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and monetarist ideas. According to Friedman and other monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if left to themselves and depressions result only from government intervention. Classical political economy Adam Smith The classical school of economic thought emerged in Britain in the late 18th century. The classical political economists Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Jean-Baptiste Say and John Stuart Mill published analyses of the production, distribution and exchange of goods in a market that have since formed the basis of study for most contemporary economists. In France, Physiocrats like Fran√ßois Quesnay promoted free trade based on a conception that wealth originated from land. Quesnay's Tableau √âconomique (1759) described the economy analytically and laid the foundation of the Physiocrats' economic theory, followed by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot who opposed tariffs and customs duties and advocated free trade. Richard Cantillon defined long-run equilibrium as the balance of flows of income and argued that the supply and demand mechanism around land influenced short-term prices. Smith's attack on mercantilism and his reasoning for \\"the system of natural liberty\\" in The Wealth of Nations (1776) are usually taken as the beginning of classical political economy. Smith devised a set of concepts that remain strongly associated with capitalism today, particularly his theory of the \\"invisible hand\\" of the market, through which the pursuit of individual self-interest unintentionally produces a collective good for society. It was necessary for Smith to be so forceful in his argument in favor of free markets because he had to overcome the popular mercantilist sentiment of the time period.Degen, Robert. The Triumph of Capitalism. 1st ed. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2008. He criticized monopolies, tariffs, duties and other state enforced restrictions of his time and believed that the market is the most fair and efficient arbitrator of resources. This view was shared by David Ricardo, second most important of the classical political economists and one of the most influential economists of modern times. In The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817), Ricardo developed the law of comparative advantage, which explains why it is profitable for two parties to trade, even if one of the trading partners is more efficient in every type of economic production. This principle supports the economic case for free trade. Ricardo was a supporter of Say's law and held the view that full employment is the normal equilibrium for a competitive economy. He also argued that inflation is closely related to changes in quantity of money and credit and was a proponent of the law of diminishing returns, which states that each additional unit of input yields less and less additional output. The values of classical political economy are strongly associated with the classical liberal doctrine of minimal government intervention in the economy, though it does not necessarily oppose the state's provision of a few basic public goods.Eric Aaron, What's Right? (Dural, Australia: Rosenberg Publishing, 2003), 75. Classical liberal thought has generally assumed a clear division between the economy and other realms of social activity, such as the state. Marxist political economy Karl Marx considered capitalism to be a historically specific mode of production (the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled, combined with the corresponding social relations between individuals based on their connection with the process of production). For Marx, the capitalist stage of development or \\"bourgeois society\\" represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide socialist or communist transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist and finally working class rule was reached.The Communist Manifesto\\"To Marx, the problem of reconstituting society did not arise from some prescription, motivated by his personal predilections; it followed, as an iron-clad historical necessity‚Äîon the one hand, from the productive forces grown to powerful maturity; on the other, from the impossibility further to organize these forces according to the will of the law of value.\\" ‚Äî Leon Trotsky, \\"Marxism in our Time\\", 1939: \\"Inevitability of Socialism\\" WSWS.org Karl Marx in 1875 Following Adam Smith, Marx distinguished the use value of commodities from their exchange value in the market. According to Marx, capital is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of labor power had itself become a commodity under capitalism because the exchange value of labor power‚Äîas reflected in the wage‚Äîis less than the value it produces for the capitalist. He argues this difference in values constitutes surplus value, which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book Capital, Marx argues that the capitalist mode of production is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers‚Äîall prior class societies had extracted surplus labor, but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities. He argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-sustenance that would allow them to be independent and must instead be compelled to survive to sell their labor for a living wage.Karl Marx. Chapter Twenty-Five: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation. Das Kapital.Dobb, Maurice 1947 Studies in the Development of Capitalism. New York: International Publishers Co., Inc.David Harvey 1989 The Condition of Postmodernity In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that exploited labor would be the driving force behind a revolution to a socialist-style economy. For Marx, this cycle of the extraction of the surplus value by the owners of capital or the bourgeoisie becomes the basis of class struggle. This argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the labor theory of value asserting that labor is the source of all value and thus of profit. In Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916), Vladimir Lenin modified classic Marxist theory and argued that capitalism necessarily induced monopoly capitalism‚Äîwhich he also called \\"imperialism\\"‚Äîto find new markets and resources, representing the last and highest stage of capitalism. Some 20th- century Marxian economists consider capitalism to be a social formation where capitalist class processes dominate, but are not exclusive.See, for example, the works of Stephen Resnick and Richard Wolff. To these thinkers, capitalist class processes are simply those in which surplus labor takes the form of surplus value, usable as capital while other tendencies for utilization of labor nonetheless exist simultaneously in existing societies where capitalist processes are predominant. However, other late Marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is extracted even if this surplus is not produced by capitalist activity as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non-capitalist economic activity. David Harvey extends Marxian thinking through which he theorizes the differential production of place, space and political activism under capitalism. He uses Marx‚Äôs theory of crisis to aid his argument that capitalism must have its \\"fixes\\", but that we cannot predetermine what fixes will be implemented, nor in what form they will be. This idea of fix is suggestive and could mean fix as in stabilize, heal or solve, or as in a junky needing a fix‚Äîthe idea of preventing feeling worse in order to feel better. In Limits to Capital (1982), Harvey outlines an overdetermined, spatially restless capitalism coupled with the spatiality of crisis formation and its resolution. Furthermore, his work has been central for understanding the contractions of capital accumulation and international movements of capitalist modes of production and money flows.Lawson, Victoria. Making Development Geography (Human Geography in the Making). New York: A Hodder Arnold Publication, 2007. Print. In his essay, \\"Notes towards a theory of uneven geographical development\\", Harvey examines the causes of the extreme volatility in contemporary political economic fortunes across and between spaces of the world economy. He bases this uneven development on four conditionalities: (1) the material embedding of capital accumulation processes in the web of socio-ecological life; (2) accumulation by dispossession; (3) the law-like character of capital accumulation in space and time; and (4) political, social and \\"class\\" struggles at a variety of geographical scales.Harvey, David. Notes towards a theory of uneven geographical development. Print. Weberian political sociology Max Weber in 1917 In some social sciences, the understanding of the defining characteristics of capitalism has been strongly influenced by 19th century German social theorist Max Weber. Weber considered market exchange rather than production as the defining feature of capitalism. In contrast to their counterparts in prior modes of economic activity, capitalist enterprises are characterized by their rationalization of production, directed toward maximizing efficiency and productivity, a tendency leading to a sociological process of enveloping rationalization. According to Weber, workers in pre-capitalist economic institutions understood work in terms of a personal relationship between master and journeyman in a guild, or between lord and peasant in a manor. In his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1904‚Äì1905), Weber sought to trace how a particular form of religious spirit, infused into traditional modes of economic activity, was a condition of possibility of modern Western capitalism. For Weber, the spirit of capitalism was in general that of ascetic Protestantism‚Äîthis ideology was able to motivate extreme rationalization of daily life, a propensity to accumulate capital by a religious ethic to advance economically and thus also the propensity to reinvest capital: this was sufficient then to create \\"self-mediating capital\\" as conceived by Marx. This is pictured in Proverbs 22:29 \\"Seest thou a man diligent in his calling? He shall stand before kings\\" and in Colossians 3:23 \\"Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men\\". In the Protestant Ethic, Weber further stated that \\"moneymaking‚Äîprovided it is done legally‚Äîis, within the modern economic order, the result and the expression of diligence in one‚Äôs calling\\" and \\"If God show you a way in which you may lawfully get more than in another way (without wrong to your soul or to any other), if you refuse this, and choose the less gainful way, you cross one of the ends of your calling, and you refuse to be God's steward, and to accept His gifts and use them for him when He requireth it: you may labour to be rich for God, though not for the flesh and sin\\" (p. 108). Most generally for Weber, Western capitalism was the \\"rational organization of formally free labor\\". The idea of the \\"formally free\\" laborer meant in the double sense of Marx that the laborer was both free to own property and free of the ability to reproduce his labor power, i.e. was the victim of expropriation of his means of production. It is only on these conditions, still abundantly obvious in the modern world of Weber, that Western capitalism is able to exist. For Weber, modern Western capitalism represented the order \\"now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt\\" (p. 123). This is further seen in his criticism of \\"specialists without spirit, hedonists without a heart\\" that were developing in his opinion with the fading of the original Puritan \\"spirit\\" associated with capitalism. Institutional economics Thorstein Veblen Once the main school of economic thought in the United States, institutional economics holds that capitalism cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded. It emphasizes the legal foundations of capitalism (see John R. Commons) and the evolutionary, habituated and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen and Daniel Bromley). One key figure in institutional economics was Thorstein Veblen who in his book The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899) analyzed the motivations of wealthy people in capitalism who conspicuously consumed their riches as a way of demonstrating success. The concept of conspicuous consumption was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient. In The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power. German Historical School and Austrian School From the perspective of the German Historical School, capitalism is primarily identified in terms of the organization of production for markets. Although this perspective shares similar theoretical roots with that of Weber, its emphasis on markets and money lends it different focus. For followers of the German Historical School, the key shift from traditional modes of economic activity to capitalism involved the shift from medieval restrictions on credit and money to the modern monetary economy combined with an emphasis on the profit motive. Ludwig von Mises In the late 19th century, the German Historical School of economics diverged with the emerging Austrian School of economics, led at the time by Carl Menger. Later generations of followers of the Austrian School continued to be influential in Western economic thought through much of the 20th century. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a forerunner of the Austrian School of economics, emphasized the \\"creative destruction\\" of capitalism‚Äîthe fact that market economies undergo constant change. At any moment of time, posits Schumpeter, there are rising industries and declining industries. Schumpeter and many contemporary economists influenced by his work argue that resources should flow from the declining to the expanding industries for an economy to grow, but they recognized that sometimes resources are slow to withdraw from the declining industries because of various forms of institutional resistance to change. The Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek were among the leading defenders of market economy against 20th century proponents of socialist planned economies. Mises and Hayek argued that only market capitalism could manage a complex, modern economy. Among their arguments were the economic calculation problem, which was first proposed by Mises in 1920 and later expounded by Hayek. The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources rationally in an economy. The free market solution is the price mechanism, wherein people individually have the ability to decide how a good or service should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for it. The price conveys embedded information about the abundance of resources as well as their desirability which in turn allows corrections that prevent shortages and surpluses on the basis of individual consensual decisions. Mises and Hayek argued that this is the only possible solution and without the information provided by market prices socialism lacks a method to rationally allocate resources. Mises argued in a famous 1920 article \\"Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth\\" that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned or controlled the means of production, then no rational prices could be obtained for capital goods as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not \\"objects of exchange\\", unlike final goods, therefore they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently. This led him to declare \\"that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth\\". Mises developed his critique of socialism more completely in his 1922 book Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis. Since a modern economy produces such a large array of distinct goods and services and consists of such a large array of consumers and enterprises, asserted Mises and Hayek, the information problems facing any other form of economic organization other than market capitalism would exceed its capacity to handle information. Thinkers within supply-side economics built on the work of the Austrian School and particularly emphasize Say's law that \\"supply creates its own demand\\". To this school, capitalism is defined by lack of state restraint on the decisions of producers. Austrian economists claim that Marx failed to make the distinction between capitalism and mercantilism. They argue that Marx conflated the imperialistic, colonialistic, protectionist and interventionist doctrines of mercantilism with capitalism. Austrian economics has been a major influence on some forms of right- libertarianism in which laissez-faire capitalism is considered to be the ideal economic system.What is Austrian Economics?, Ludwig Von Mises Institute. It influenced economists and political philosophers and theorists including Henry Hazlitt, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Israel Kirzner, Murray Rothbard, Walter Block and Richard M. Ebeling.DiLorenzo, Thomas. \\"Frederic Bastiat (1801‚Äì1850): Between the French and Marginalist Revolutions.\\" Mises.orgMises.org, Thornton, Mark. \\"Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat as an Austrian Economist.\\" Keynesian economics John Maynard Keynes In his 1937 The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, the British economist John Maynard Keynes argued that capitalism suffered a basic problem in its ability to recover from periods of slowdowns in investment. Keynes argued that a capitalist economy could remain in an indefinite equilibrium despite high unemployment. Essentially rejecting Say's law, he argued that some people may have a liquidity preference that would see them rather hold money than buy new goods or services, which therefore raised the prospect that the Great Depression would not end without what he termed in the General Theory \\"a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment\\". Keynesian economics challenged the notion that laissez-faire capitalist economics could operate well on their own without state intervention used to promote aggregate demand, fighting high unemployment and deflation of the sort seen during the 1930s. He and his followers recommended \\"pump-priming\\" the economy to avoid recession: cutting taxes, increasing government borrowing and spending during an economic down-turn. This was to be accompanied by trying to control wages nationally partly through the use of inflation to cut real wages and to deter people from holding money. Keynes tried to provide solutions to many of Marx‚Äôs problems without completely abandoning the classical understanding of capitalism. His work attempted to show that regulation can be effective and that economic stabilizers can rein in the aggressive expansions and recessions that Marx disliked. These changes sought to create more stability in the business cycle and reduce the abuses of laborers. Keynesian economists argue that Keynesian policies were one of the primary reasons capitalism was able to recover following the Great Depression. However, the premises of Keynes‚Äôs work have since been challenged by neoclassical and supply-side economics and the Austrian School. Another challenge to Keynesian thinking came from his colleague Piero Sraffa and subsequently from the Neo- Ricardian school that followed Sraffa. In Sraffa's highly technical analysis, capitalism is defined by an entire system of social relations among both producers and consumers, but with a primary emphasis on the demands of production. According to Sraffa, the tendency of capital to seek its highest rate of profit causes a dynamic instability in social and economic relations. Supply-side economics Supply-side economics is a school of macroeconomic thought that argues that economic growth can be most effectively created by lowering barriers for people to produce (supply) goods and services, such as adjusting income tax and capital gains tax rates and by allowing greater flexibility by reducing regulation. Consumers will then benefit from a greater supply of goods and services at lower prices. The term \\"supply-side economics\\" was thought for some time to have been coined by journalist Jude Wanniski in 1975, but according to Robert D. Atkinson's Supply-Side FolliesAtkinson, Robert D. Supply-side Follies: Why Conservative Economics Fails, Liberal Economics Falters, and Innovation Economics Is the Answer. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. Print. the term \\"supply side\\" (\\"supply-side fiscalists\\") was first used in 1976 by Herbert Stein (a former economic adviser to President Nixon) and only later that year was this term repeated by Jude Wanniski. Its use connotes the ideas of economists Robert Mundell and Arthur Laffer. Today, supply-side economics is often conflated with the politically rhetorical term \\"trickle-down economics\\", but as Jude Wanniski points out in his book The Way The World Works trickle-down economics is conservative Keynesianism associated with the Republican Party. Typical policy recommendations of supply-side economics are lower marginal tax rates and less regulation. Maximum benefits from taxation policy are achieved by optimizing the marginal tax rates to spur growth, although it is a common misunderstanding that supply side economics is concerned only with taxation policy when it is about removing barriers to production more generally. Many early proponents argued that the size of the economic growth would be significant enough that the increased government revenue from a faster-growing economy would be sufficient to compensate completely for the short-term costs of a tax cut and that tax cuts could in fact cause overall revenue to increase. Neoclassical economics and the Chicago School Today, the majority academic research on capitalism in the English-speaking world draws on neoclassical economic thought. It favors extensive market coordination and relatively neutral patterns of governmental market regulation aimed at maintaining property rights; deregulated labor markets; corporate governance dominated by financial owners of firms; and financial systems depending chiefly on capital market-based financing rather than state financing. Milton Friedman took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and gave them a new twist. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of The New York Times, where he claims that the social responsibility of business is \\"to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits‚Ä¶(through) open and free competition without deception or fraud\\". This is similar to Smith‚Äôs argument that self-interest in turn benefits the whole of society. Work like this helped lay the foundations for the coming marketization (or privatization) of state enterprises and the supply-side economics of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and monetarist ideas. According to Friedman and other monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if left to themselves and depressions result only from government intervention. Friedman argued that the Great Depression was result of a contraction of the money supply controlled by the Federal Reserve and not by the lack of investment as John Maynard Keynes: \\"There is likely to be a lag between the need for action and government recognition of the need; a further lag between recognition of the need for action and the taking of action; and a still further lag between the action and its effects\\".Friedman (1967) p. Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression. Neoclassical economists, today the majority of economists, consider value to be subjective, varying from person to person and for the same person at different times and thus reject the labor theory of value. Marginalism is the theory that economic value results from marginal utility and marginal cost (the marginal concepts). These economists see capitalists as earning profits by forgoing current consumption, by taking risks, and by organizing production. Mainstream economics Mainstream economics is a loose term used to refer to the non-heterodox economics taught in prominent universities. It is most closely associated with neoclassical economics,David C. Colander, Complexity and History of Economic Thought, p. 35. or more precisely by the neoclassical synthesis, which combines neoclassical approach to microeconomics with Keynesian approach to macroeconomics.Clark, B. (1998). Political-economy: A comparative approach. Westport, CT: Praeger. Mainstream economists are not generally separated into schools, but two major contemporary orthodox economic schools of thought are the \\"saltwater and freshwater schools\\". The saltwater schools consist of the universities and other institutions located near the East and West Coast of the United States, such as Berkeley, Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Columbia, Duke, Stanford and Yale. Freshwater schools include the University of Chicago, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Rochester and the University of Minnesota. They were referred to as the \\"freshwater school\\" since Pittsburgh, Chicago, Rochester and Minneapolis are located nearer to the Great Lakes.Gordon: Productivity ... \\"four universities placed on or near bodies of fresh water, Carnegie-Mellon, Chicago, Minnesota and Rochester\\" The Saltwater school is associated with Keynesian ideas of government intervention into the free market while the Freshwater schools are skeptical of the benefits of the government.Kilborn PT. (1988). 'Fresh water' Economists Gain. New York Times. Mainstream economists do not in general identify themselves as members of a particular school, but they may be associated with approaches within a field such as the rational-expectations approach to macroeconomics.

Competing in the 200 m breaststroke, he won the European title in 1950 and an Olympic bronze medal in 1952. During his career, he concurrently held two world records in the 200 m breaststroke in short course with a time of 2:27.3,Los Angeles Times 10 June 1951 Page B12 long course with a time of 2:34.4,Es fehlt noch die Goldmedaille in Spiegel Online one world record in the 100 m breaststroke with a time of 1:05.5.Es fehlt noch die Goldmedaille in Spiegel Online and a world record in the 500 m breaststroke with a time of 7:07.3. In 1950, he was elected German Sportspersonality of the year. FINA at the time recognized world records in the 200 m breaststroke that were set in either short course (25 meter) or long course (50 meter) pools. As a result, his world record (short course) with a time of 2:27.3 in the 200 m breaststroke set in 1951 was the only one widely known. His long course record set in 1950 with a time of 2:34.4, was preceded by Joe Verdeur in 1948 who swam with a time of 2:36.3 at the US Olympic Trials. At the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, he easily qualified for the final of the 200-meter breaststroke. This was the first Olympics since 1936 in Berlin that German and Japanese athletes could compete as the 1940 and 1944 Olympics were cancelled and Germany and Japan were banned from participating in 1948. In the Olympic final, Klein was third behind Australian John Davies the gold medalist and American Bowen Stassforth. His world record in the 200 m breaststroke (long course) of 2:34.4 was equaled by John Davies in the final. Davies, Stassforth, and Klein were the only three swimmers in history to better 2:35 in the 200 m breaststroke (long course) prior to the bifurcation of the stroke in 1953. He also competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in the 200 m breaststroke. This was the first Olympics after the breaststroke stroke was bifurcated in 1953 into two strokes-the contemporary underwater breaststroke with a frog kick and the butterfly stroke with the over the water arm motion using the dolphin kick.

In 1947, after seeing posters plastered all around Cornwall regarding a swimming race, he petitioned his captors if he could enter the Cornwall Swimming Championships held in Fowey harbour. Initially, his British captors were skeptical of his abilities to even swim. After additional petitioning by his fellow prisoners, he was allowed to enter the race. He won by a substantial margin and was given a cardboard case as a prize. He was released a year later in 1948.Es fehlt noch die Goldmedaille in Spiegel Online Record Notes The world record for the 200 meter breaststroke prior to the bifurcation of the butterfly breaststroke into separate strokes in 1953 could be accomplished in either short or long course pools. FINA recognized only one world record for the 200 meter breaststroke. The 1952 US Olympic Book lists the 200 meter breaststroke world record as belonging to Herbert Klein with a time of 2:27.3 who swam it in a short course pool. If records were measured as they are today in long and short course pools, John Davies tied Herbert Klein's long course world record of 2:34.4 set in 1950 at their 1952 Olympic final.

It is a last-ditch tactic in air combat, sometimes used when all else has failed. Long before the invention of aircraft, ramming tactics in naval warfare and ground warfare were common. The first aerial ramming was performed by Pyotr Nesterov in 1914 during the First World War. In the early stages of World War II the tactic was employed by Soviet pilots, who called it taran, the Russian word for \\"battering ram\\". A ramming pilot could use the weight of the aircraft as a ram, or they could try to make the enemy lose control of their plane, using the propeller or wing to damage the enemy's tail or a wing. Ramming took place when a pilot ran out of ammunition yet was still intent on destroying an enemy, or when the plane had already been damaged beyond saving. Most rammings occurred when the attacker's aircraft was economically, strategically or tactically less valuable than the enemy's, such as pilots flying obsolescent aircraft against superior ones, or one man risking his life to kill multiple men. Defending forces resorted to ramming more often than the attackers. A ramming attack was not considered suicidal in the same manner as kamikaze attacks‚Äîthe ramming pilot stood a chance of surviving, though it was very risky. Sometimes the ramming aircraft itself could survive to make a controlled landing, though most were lost due to combat damage or the pilot bailing out. Ramming was used in air warfare in the first half of the 20th century, in both World Wars and in the interwar period. With jet aircraft, as air combat speeds increased, ramming became disused‚Äîthe probability of successfully executing (and surviving) a ramming attack approached impossibility. However, the tactic is still possible in modern warfare. Technique Three types of ramming attacks were made: * Using the propeller to go in from behind and chop off the controls in the tail of the enemy aircraft. This was the most difficult to perform, but it had the best chance of survival. * Using the wing to damage the enemy or force a loss of control. Some Soviet aircraft like the Polikarpov I-16 had wings strengthened for this purpose. * Direct ramming using the whole aircraft. This was the easiest but also the most dangerous option. The first two options were always premeditated but required a high level of piloting skill. The last option might be premeditated or it might be a snap decision made during combat; either way it often killed the attacking pilot. History In Jules Verne's novel Robur the Conqueror, Robur almost rams his propeller-powered flying vessel Albatross into the slower blimp Goahead Lt Wilbert Wallace White Early concepts Presaging the 20th century air warfare ramming actions, Jules Verne imagined an apparent aerial attack made by a heavy flying machine with a prominent ram prow against a nearly defenseless lighter-than-air craft in his science fiction work Robur the Conqueror, published in 1886. H. G. Wells, writing in 1899 in his novel The Sleeper Awakes, has his main character, Graham, ram one of the enemy's aeroplanes with his flying apparatus, causing it to fall out of the sky. A second enemy machine ceases its attack, afraid of being rammed in turn.The Project Gutenberg Etext of When the Sleeper Wakes, by Wells. #7 in our series by H. G. Wells. In 1909, the airship was imagined as an \\"aerial battleship\\" by several observers who wrote about the possibility of using an extended ramming pole to attack other airships, and to swing an anchor or other mass on a cable below the airship as a blunt force attack against ground-based targets such as buildings and smokestacks, and against ship masts. World War I Ramming attack performed by Pyotr Nesterov Albatros aircraft brought down by Nesterov The first known instance of ramming in air warfare was made over Zhovkva by the Russian pilot Pyotr Nesterov on 8 September 1914, against an Austrian plane. That incident was fatal to both parties. The second ramming‚Äîand the first successful ramming that was not fatal to the attacker‚Äîwas performed in 1915 by Alexander Kazakov, a flying ace and the most successful Russian fighter pilot of World War I.Durkota et al, p. 60. Sgt Arturo Dell'Oro of the Italian 83rd Squadron rammed a two-man Br.C.1 of Flik 45 on 1 September 1917.The Aerodrome Forum Wilbert Wallace White of the 147th Aero Squadron rammed a German plane on 10 October 1918, and was killed ‚Äî his opponent survived. Polish-Soviet War As the advancing Red Army used very few aircraft in Poland, air combat rarely took place (except for interceptions of Bolshevik observation balloons). However, during the course of the war, several pilots, having depleted their ammunition and bombs, attempted to ram Soviet cavalry with their aircraft's undercarriages. This attack would allow an opportunity for an emergency landing, but it almost always ended with the destruction of, or serious damage to, the ramming aircraft. Spanish Civil War Ramming was used in the Spanish Civil War. On the night of 27‚Äì28 November 1937, Soviet pilot Evgeny Stepanov, flying a Polikarpov I-15 for the Spanish Republican Air Force, shot down one SM.81 bomber near Barcelona and emptied the rest of his bullets into another. The second SM.81 continued to fly, so Stepanov resorted to using the left leg of his Chaika's undercarriage to ram the bomber, downing the plane. World War IIPoland= The Polish Air Force pilot Lieutenant Colonel Leopold Pamu≈Ça carried out the first taran attack in World War II, on 1 September 1939 over ≈Åomianki near Warsaw, with his damaged PZL P.11c. =Soviet Union= In World War II, reports of ramming by lone Soviet pilots against the Luftwaffe became widespread, especially in the early days of the hostilities in the war's Eastern Front. In the first year of the Great Patriotic War, most available Soviet machines were markedly inferior to the German ones and pilots sometimes perceived a taran as the only way to guarantee the destruction of the enemy. Early Soviet fighter engines were relatively weak, and the underpowered fighters were either fairly well-armed but too slow, or fast but too lightly armed. Lightly armed fighters often expended their ammunition without bringing down the enemy bomber. Very few fighters had radios installed‚Äîthe pilots had no way to call for assistance and the military expected them to solve problems alone. Trading a single fighter for a multi-engine bomber was considered economically sound. In some cases, pilots who were heavily wounded or in damaged aircraft decided to perform a suicidal attack against air, ground or naval targets. In this instance, the attack becomes more like an unpremeditated kamikaze attack (see Nikolai Gastello). German air tactics early in the war changed in a way that created conditions ripe for ramming attacks. After clearing much of Soviet airpower from their path, the Luftwaffe stopped providing fighter escort for bombing groups, and split their forces into much smaller sorties, including single aircraft making deep penetration flights. One quarter of German aircraft on the Eastern Front had the task of performing strategic or tactical reconnaissance with their Aufkl√§rungsgruppe units. These reconnaissance or long-range bombing flights were more likely to encounter lone Soviet defenders. Soviet group tactics did not include taran, but Soviet fighters often sortied singly or in pairs rather than in groups. Soviet pilots were prohibited from performing taran over enemy-held land, but could ram enemy reconnaissance penetrations over the homeland. Nine rammings took place on the very first day of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, one within the first hour. At 0425 hours on 22 June 1941, Lieutenant Ivan Ivanov drove his Polikarpov I-16 into the tail of an invading Heinkel He 111. Ivanov did not survive but was posthumously awarded the gold star, Hero of the Soviet Union.Hardesty 1991 Yekaterina Zelenko on 12 September 1941 supposedly performed a diving ramming attack in her Su-2, which tore a Messerschmitt Bf 109 in two as the propeller of her plane hit the German aircraft's tail. She remains the only woman ever alleged to have performed an aerial ramming. After 1943 more Soviet fighters had radios installed, and Chief Marshall Alexander Novikov developed air-control techniques to coordinate attacks. The fighters had more powerful engines, and in the last year of battle they carried sufficiently heavy armament. As Soviet air-attack options improved, ramming became a rare occurrence. In 1944, future Air Marshall Alexander Pokryshkin officially discouraged the taran, limiting it to \\"exceptional instances and as an extreme measure\\". Lieutenant Boris Kovzan survived a record four ramming attacks in the war. Aleksei Khlobystov made three. Seventeen other Soviet pilots were credited with two successful ramming attacks. According to new research, at least 636 successful taran attacks were made by Soviets between the beginning of Operation Barbarossa and the end of the war.Ja≈õkiewicz, ≈Åukasz; Matus, Yury. Tarany powietrzne w wielkiej wojnie ojczy≈∫nianej w drugim okresie wojny, \\"Lotnictwo\\" 7-8/2017 (in Polish), p.93-97 Of these, 227 pilots were killed during the attack or afterwards (35.7%), but 233 landed safely (the rest bailed out). As new Soviet fighter designs went into service, ramming was discouraged. The economics had shifted; now the Soviet fighter was roughly equivalent to the German one.Hardesty, Von. Red Phoenix: The Rise of Soviet Air Power 1941‚Äì1945. Smithsonian, 1991, p. 29. By September 1944, orders describing how and when to initiate the ramming attack were removed from training materials. =United Kingdom and Commonwealth= On 18 August 1940, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve Sergeant Bruce Hancock of No.6 SFTS from RAF Windrush used his Avro Anson aircraft to ram a Heinkel He 111P; there were no survivors.RAF Windrush On the same day Flight Lieutenant James Eglington Marshall of No. 85 Squadron RAF used his Hawker Hurricane to ram the tail unit of a Heinkel He 111 after he had expended the last of his ammunition on it. The Hurricane's starboard wing tip broke off in the attack and the Heinkel was assessed as \\"probably destroyed\\". Zehbe's Dornier falling on Victoria Station after being rammed by Ray Holmes, 15 September 1940 A significant event took place on 15 September 1940, now known as \\"Battle of Britain Day\\". Flight Sergeant Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron RAF used his Hawker Hurricane to destroy a Dornier Do 17 bomber over London by ramming but at the loss of his own aircraft (and almost his own life) in one of the defining moments of the Battle of Britain. Holmes, making a head-on attack, found his guns inoperative. He flew his plane into the top-side of the German bomber, cutting off the rear tail section with his wing and causing the bomber to dive out of control and crash. Its pilot, Oberleutnant Robert Zehbe, bailed out, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack, while the injured Holmes bailed out of his plane and survived.Those Other Eagles, Shores, (2004) Two other crewmen of the Dornier bailed out and survived. As the RAF did not practice ramming as an air combat tactic, this was considered an impromptu manoeuvre, and an act of selfless courage. This event became one of the defining moments of the Battle of Britain and elicited a congratulatory note to the RAF from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who had witnessed the event.\\"Alfred Keith Ogilvie Battle of Britain Pilot with 609 Squadron.\\" lycos.co.uk. Retrieved: 25 July 2009. On 27 September 1940, Flying Officer Percival R. F. Burton (South African) of No. 249 Squadron RAF used his Hawker Hurricane to tear off the tail unit of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 of V/LG 1. According to eyewitnesses on the ground, Burton deliberately rammed the Bf 110 after a \\"wildly manoeuvring\\" chase at rooftop height over Hailsham, England. Burton, Hauptmann Horst Liensberger and Unteroffizier Albert Kopge were all killed when both aircraft crashed just outside town. Burton's Hurricane was found exhausted of ammunition. On 7 October 1940, Pilot Officer Ken W. Mackenzie of No. 501 Squadron RAF used his Hawker Hurricane to destroy a Messerschmitt Bf 109. His Combat Report read: > I attacked the three nearest machines in vic formation from beneath and a > fourth enemy aircraft doing rear-guard flew across the line of fire and he > developed a leak in the glycol tank...

On 11 November 1940, Flight Lieutenant Howard Peter Blatchford (Canadian) of No. 257 Squadron RAF used the propeller of his Hawker Hurricane to attack a Fiat CR.42 near Harwich, England. Blatchford had used up his ammunition during a m√™l√©e with Italian fighters, and upon returning to base discovered two of his propeller blades missing nine inches. Although he did not see the results of his attack and only claimed the Italian fighter as \\"damaged\\", he did report splashes of blood on his damaged propeller. Although technically not ramming, RAF pilots did use an intentional collision of sorts against the V-1 flying bomb. When it was discovered that shooting a V-1 could detonate the warhead and/or fuel tank, thereby endangering the attacking aircraft, pilots would instead fly beside the V-1. Once in position, the pilot would roll to one side, lifting his wingtip to produce an area of high-pressure turbulence beneath the wingtip of the V-1, causing it to roll in the opposite direction. The rudimentary automatic pilot of the V-1 was often not able to compensate, sending it diving into the ground. =Greece= On 2 November 1940, Hellenic Air Force pilot Marinos Mitralexis shot down one Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bomber; then, out of ammunition, brought another down by smashing its rudder with the propeller of his PZL P.24 fighter. Both aircraft were forced into emergency landings, and Mitralexis threatened the bomber's four-man crew into surrender using his pistol. Mitralexis was promoted in rank and awarded medals. =Japan= The Japanese also practised ramming, both by individual initiative and by policy. Individual initiative saw a Nakajima Ki-43 fighter plane bringing down a lone B-17 Flying Fortress, The Fighting Swede, on 8 May 1942. After three of the Japanese fighters had each made two attack passes without decisive results, the bomber's pilot, Major Robert N. Keatts, made for the shelter of a nearby rain-squall. Loath to let the bomber escape, Sgt. Tadao Oda executed a head-on ramming attack, known as . Hastings 2008, p. 164 Both aircraft crashed with no survivors. Sergeant Oda was posthumously promoted to lieutenant for his sacrifice. Pacific Wrecks. B-17F \\"Fighting Swede\\" Serial Number 41-24520 On 26 March 1943, Lieutenant Sanae Ishii of the 64th Sentai used the wing of his Nakajima Ki-43 to ram the tail of a Bristol Beaufighter, bringing it down over Shwebandaw, Burma, killing both Squadron Leader Ivan G. Statham AFC and Pilot Officer Kenneth C. Briffett of 27 Squadron RAF. On 1 May 1943 Sergeant Miyoshi Watanabe of the 64th Sentai knocked out two engines of a B-24 Liberator piloted by Robert Kavanaugh, killing two of the bombers crew; he then used his Nakajima Ki-43 to ram the rear turret of the American bomber after a drawn-out battle over Rangoon. Sergeant Watanabe survived the attack, as did the remaining B-24 crew. Both planes made a forced landing without further loss of life. The crashed B-24 was photographed and appeared in the December 1943 Japanese aviation magazine Koku Asahi. Only three of Kavanaugh's crew survived the war under harsh conditions as POWs. On 26 October 1943 Corporal Tomio Kamiguchi of the 64th Sentai used his Nakajima Ki-43 to ram a B-24 Liberator, when his guns failed to fire during a sustained attack lasting over 50 minutes by Ki-43II and Kawasaki Ki-45s of 21st Sentai. The engagement included approximately 50 two- ship passes on the B-24s after they attacked Rangoon. Nearing the Bay of Bengal and already heavily damaged by the other Japanese fighters in the 64th, the bomber, belonging to the 492nd Bomb Squadron and piloted by 1st Lt. Roy G. Vaughan, crashed in the jungle approaching Gwa Bay. Bombardier 2nd Lt. Gustaf 'Gus' Johnston was the sole survivor of the B-24 and became a POW. Kamiguchi was thrown clear in the impact, parachuted, and also survived. American researcher Matthew Poole notes that Japanese historian Hiroshi Ichimura interviewed 64th Sentai veteran Lt. Naoyuki Ito, who also claimed to have shot down a B-24 of the 492nd BS on 26 October 1943. The B-24 was claimed to have been shot down by two experienced Japanese aces: Lt. Naoyuki Ito and Sgt. Major Takuwa. In addition, Ito stated that 19-year-old green pilot Cpl. Kamiguchi rammed the crippled B-24, and General Major Shinichi Tanaka praised the brave young pilot and made \\"Corporal Saw\\" a legend on purpose. Another 64th Sentai veteran, Sgt. Ikezawa, recalled that a sullen Sgt. Major Takuwa said to him \\"The B-24 was going down. Kamiguchi did not need to ram it!\\" I. Hata, Y. Izawa, and C. Shores in Japanese Army Air Force Fighter Units and Their Aces 1939‚Äì1945 includes the biography of Capt. Ito of the 64th Sentai which states: ‚ÄúHe later transferred to the 3rd Chutai, and was to claim eight victories, including a B-24 over Rangoon on 26 October 1943.‚Äù According to Ichimura, Sgt. Maj. Takuwa's account was not included in this source, as only aces with nine or more victories were given a biography in the book. On 6 June 1944, having expended his ammunition in an extended dogfight, Sergeant Tomesaku Igarashi of the 50th Sentai used the propeller of his Nakajima Ki-43 to bring down a Lockheed P-38 Lightning near Meiktila, Burma. After the pilot bailed out, Igarashi attacked him in his parachute. The P-38 may have belonged to 10-kill ace Captain Walter F. Duke of the 459th Fighter Squadron who went missing in battle that day. Starting in August 1944, several Japanese pilots flying Kawasaki Ki-45 and other fighters engaging B-29 Superfortresses found that ramming the very heavy bomber was a practical tactic.Takaki and Sakaida 2001. From that experience, in November 1944 a \\"Special Attack Unit\\" was formed using Kawasaki Ki-61s that had been stripped of most of their weapons and armor so as to quickly achieve high altitude. Three successful surviving ramming pilots were the first recipients of the Bukosho, Japan's equivalent to the Victoria Cross or Medal of Honor, an award which had been inaugurated on 7 December 1944 as an Imperial Edict by Emperor Hirohito.Sakaida 1997, pp. 67‚Äì70.Bukosho described. Retrieved: 3 June 2008. Membership in the Special Attack Unit was seen as a final assignment; the pilots were expected to perform ramming attacks until death or serious injury stopped their service. The Japanese practice of kamikaze may also be viewed as a form of ramming, although the primary mode of destruction was not physical impact force, but rather the explosives carried. Kamikaze was used exclusively against Allied ship targets. =Bulgaria= Two rammings () were performed by Bulgarian fighter pilots defending Sofia against Allied bombers in 1943 and 1944. The first one was by poruchik (Senior Lieutenant) Dimitar Spisarevski on 20 December 1943. Flying a Bf 109 G2 fighter, he rammed and destroyed American B-24 Liberator #42-73428 of the 376th Bomb Group, though it is unknown whether the collision was intentional. The Bulgarian military said it was deliberate, and increased his rank posthumously. The second ramming was performed by poruchik Nedelcho Bonchev on 17 April 1944 against an American B-17 Flying Fortress. Bonchev succeeded in bailing out and surviving after the ramming. After the fall of the Third Bulgarian Kingdom 9 September 1944 he went on flying against the Germans. His Bf 109 was shot down during a mission and he was wounded and taken captive. After several months in captivity, he was killed by a female SS guard during a POW march which he could not take, owing to his critical health condition. =Germany= On 22 February 1944 a Messerschmitt Bf 109 rammed B-17 231377 of the 327th Bombardment Squadron.92nd Bomb Group memorial On 25 May 1944 Oberf√§hnrich Hubert Heckmann used his Messerschmitt Bf 109 to ram a P-51 Mustang when his guns malfunctioned, severing the tail and rear fuselage from the American aircraft. Captain Joseph H. Bennett of the 336th Fighter Squadron managed to bail out to captivity, while Heckmann made an immediate belly landing near Botenheim, Germany. On 7 July 1944 Unteroffizier Willi Reschke used his Messerschmitt Bf 109 to ram a Consolidated B-24 Liberator when his guns malfunctioned. The two falling aircraft were locked together, and it was some time before Reschke was able to free himself and bail out near Malacky, Slovakia. Late in World War II, the Luftwaffe used ramming to try to regain control of the air. The plan was to dissuade Allied bomber pilots from conducting bombing raids long enough for the Germans to create a significant number of Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters to turn the tide of the air war. On 4 April 1945 Heinrich Ehrler rammed a B-24 and was killed. Only a single dedicated unit, Sonderkommando Elbe, was ever formed to the point of being operational, and flew their only mission ‚Äì only a month before the end of the war in Europe ‚Äì on 7 April 1945. Although some pilots succeeded in destroying bombers, including one ramming during the sole mission that took out two B-24s at once with one Bf 109G, Allied numbers were not significantly reduced. Perhaps the most famous example of aerial ramming carried out by Elbe that resulted in the pilot surviving ramming their plane during this mission was that of Heinrich Rosner's Bf 109 vs. B-24 44-49533 \\"Palace of Dallas\\", which was leading a formation of B-24s of the 389th Bombardment Group at the time. Rosner's plane sliced through the cockpit of \\"Palace of Dallas\\" with its wing, destroying the bomber and crippling the Bf-109, which then collided with an additional unidentified B-24. Rosner was able to successfully bail out and parachute to safety.#44-49533 12 O'clock High Forum Projects of aircraft such as the Zeppelin Rammer were intended to use the ramming technique. =France= On 3 August 1944, Captain Jean Maridor of No. 91 Squadron RAF used his Supermarine Spitfire to ram a V-1 flying bomb, killing himself when the warhead detonated. Capitaine Maridor had previously damaged the V-1 with his cannon fire, and seeing it begin to dive onto a military field hospital in Kent, chose to deliberately ram the bomb. Thomas, Andrew. V1 Flying Bomb Aces. Botley, Oxford, UK: Osprey Publishing, 2013. =United States= On 25 October 1942 over Guadalcanal, Marine First Lieutenant Jack E. Conger of VMF-212 shot down three Misubishi A6M Zeros. Pursuing a fourth Zero, Conger ran out of ammunition and decided to use his propellor to chop the tail rudder off. However, Conger misjudged the distance between his plane and the Zero and struck the plane halfway between the cockpit and the tail, tearing the entire tail off. Both Conger and the Zero pilot, Shiro Ishikawa, bailed out of their planes and were picked up by a rescue boat. For his actions, Conger was awarded the Navy Cross. On 10 May 1945 over Okinawa, Marine First Lieutenant Robert R. Klingman and three other pilots of VMF-312 climbed to intercept an aircraft they identified as a Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu (\\"Nick\\") twin-engined heavy fighter flying reconnaissance at , but the \\"Nick\\" began climbing higher. Two of the FG-1D Corsairs ceased their pursuit at , but Marine Captain Kenneth Reusser and his wingman Klingman continued to , expending most of their .50 caliber ammunition to lighten their aircraft. Reusser scored hits on the \\"Nick's\\" port engine, but ran out of ammunition, and was under fire from the Japanese rear gunner. Klingman lined up for a shot at a distance of when his guns jammed due to the extreme cold. He approached the \\"Nick\\" three times to damage it with his propeller, chopping away at his opponent's rudder, rear cockpit, and right stabilizer. The Toryu spun down to where its wings came off. Despite missing five inches (13 cm) from the ends of his propeller blades, running out of fuel and having an aircraft dented and punctured by debris and bullets, Klingman safely guided his Corsair to a deadstick landing.Tillman 1979, pp. 148‚Äì149. He was awarded the Navy Cross.Sherrod 1952, pp. 392‚Äì393. Cold War In the 1960 U-2 incident, Soviet pilot Igor Mentyukov was scrambled with orders to ram the intruding Lockheed U-2, using his unarmed Sukhoi Su-9 which had been modified for higher altitude flight. In 1996, Mentyukov claimed that contact with his aircraft's slipstream downed Gary Powers; however, Sergei Khrushchev asserted in 2000 that Mentyukov failed even to gain visual contact. On 28 November 1973, during the CIA's Project Dark Gene, Captain Gennadii N. Eliseev, flying a MiG-21, made the first jet-to-jet ramming attack against an RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft piloted by IIAF Major Shokouhnia and backseater USAF Colonel John Saunders over Soviet airspace. After both his K-13 air to air missiles failed to down the RF-4C and his gun jammed, he struck the RF-4C's tail assembly with his wing. While the MiG pilot died, the RF-4C crew ejected successfully.https://sputniknews.com/military/201811281070215894-cia-iran-spy- ussr/ On 18 July 1981 Captain V.A. Kulyapin reportedly used his Su-15 to ram a chartered Argentine CL-44 during the 1981 Armenia mid-air collision, although Western experts believed this likely to have been a self-serving interpretation of an accidental collision. A 1986 RAND Corporation study concluded that the ramming attack was still a viable option for modern jets defending their airspace from long-range bombers if those bombers were carrying atomic weapons. The study posited that defending fighters might expend their weapons without downing the enemy bomber, and the pilots would then be faced with the final choice of ramming‚Äîalmost certainly trading their lives to save the thousands who might be killed by a successful nuclear attack. After 1990 During the 9/11 attacks in 2001, fighter jets were dispatched to intercept the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93, believed to be heading to Washington. However, there was no time for the combat jets to be armed with missiles. The pilots were informed that they would be ramming the aircraft. The plane crashed due to an internal struggle by the time the jets arrived. See also * Mid-air collision References=NotesBibliography * Allen Durkota; Thomas Darcy; Victor Kulikov.

Dunn's Pavilion was originally purchased by owner Gerry Dunn in 1929, and built into a concert hall in 1930 with the aim of hosting big bands. Back in the 1930s the slogan for the concert hall was, \\"Where All of Muskoka Dances.\\" The name wasn't switched to The KEE to Bala, or The KEE as it is often called, until the late 1960s after changing ownership twice. History Gerry Patrick Dunn purchased the property in 1929 when there was only a small ice cream parlour and drugstore on the lot. Dunn started renovating the buildings in the second year of ownership in order to be able to host orchestras as an attraction in the small town. The first two bands to play in the renovated building were Jerry Richardson and the Varsity Collegians, and Carl Mueller's Varsity Entertainers. At the end of the 1930s, Dunn decided to tear down the old building in order to be able to host the bigger bands he desired, and provide more room for people to dance. The expansion was built by Gerry Dunn himself, as well as 14 additional workers. It is said that while the construction was taking place you could often see him sitting on the roof, anchoring down the supports. \\"'I designed the pavilion myself ‚Äì no architect was involved,' says Dunn, who at 97 years old was back at his Bala summer home in 1998.\\"http://www.thekee.com/kee-history-2/ The new building was completed in the summer of 1942; built with the stage backdrop to be a fa√ßade of an actual small cottage. Dunn renovated the dance floor and was expanded from 35 feet to 100 feet. They hosted small house bands and dancing 6 nights a week, and big bands once a week throughout the summer months. People would dress up in their finest attire and make a night of dancing. Customers would have to bring their own alcohol after the prohibition and during the depression years because most venues didn't have the licenses to sell it because it was very expensive to obtain the license.http://www.agingincanada.ca/Seniors%20Alcohol/1a.htm On the nights of the Big Bands, Dunn would try to attract people from the cities and towns surrounding Bala, as well as attracting people from Toronto who would enjoy a weekend away. New ownership In 1963, at the age of 62, Gerry Dunn sold Dunn's Pavilion to Ray Cockburn. Ray had owned a similar venue in Orillia called 'The Pavalon' and wanted to expand his ownership in the bar business. In order to take advantage of the new rock and roll style of music, Ray renamed the venue and called it The KEE to Bala. \\"Says Ray, 'A short name, easily remembered, was what I wanted, and when someone suggested that the pavilion was the \`key' to Bala and the surrounding Muskoka area, I jumped at the idea and changed the spelling to KEE.'\\" The KEE had wonderful years throughout the 1960s and 1970s under Ray's ownership. This was because Ray promised the bands that they could play in Orillia one night, and in Bala the next night making it worth the detour. Normally bands wouldn't travel two hours north of the major cities in order to perform, but after they played in Toronto they often liked visiting relaxing venues to play for smaller crowds. In the 1970s the Parry family approached Ray Cockburn wanting to buy out The KEE; they owned it throughout the 1970s and 1980s. They updated the venue to make it more of a bar by obtaining a liquor license, building a new stage, and installing bars so that it was no longer BYOB. After this it was sold to Joe Kondyjowski who had a lot of experience in the dance hall business. He took over in the 1980s and brought in large rock and roll crowds. Joe made enough money in order to cover the expenses to fix up the old wooden building, create a parking lot, install a new roof, build a new deck, and put in cement cribs to fix the fact that the building was starting to sink. He installed a new kitchen in order to serve food in addition to the alcohol at the bars, while updating the colour scheme to give the venue a \\"Cape Cod\\" feel. Joe Kondyjowski sold The KEE in 1990 to Sanober Patel who was assisted by her son Jim. Sanober brought in a weekly comedy night in order to try to obtain more business from a larger variety of people as well as a big band event to attract the old clientele that used to attend. Present In 1995, The KEE was sold to a partnership; Stephen Wylie was one of the partners and he took over the operations of the business. Stephen understood the importance that the venue had for many people and tried to hold onto the history in the building. He repainted it back to the original colours and even brought back Big Band dances where the band would use the original stage. The building has now been called \\"The KEE to Bala\\" for over 30 years. The dress code has since changed from formal attire to casual clothing with the music changing to fit with the new generations.

Released in 1967, the album is influenced not only by Latin rhythms such as the Puerto Rican Jala Jala, but also by beat music. Backed by the lead single \\"Richie's Jala Jala\\", the album was an international success, being popular in the United States, Colombia, Puerto Rico and other countries. The album's success led to the release of the follow-up Jala Jala Boogaloo Volume II with a similar cover and sound. Background With their previous albums, Richie Ray & Bobby Cruz had established themselves as prominent artists in the New York music scene of the 1960s. Following the success of hit singles such as \\"El Mulato,\\" the duet received a contract with the Tico and Alegre record companies presided by Moris Levy. Moris Pelsman, Levy's partner, designated the famous Pancho Cristal to produce and supervise the duet's new recordings. After releasing Se Solt√≥ early on that same year, Richie Ray & Bobby Cruz went into the studio with Pancho Cristal and engineers Fred Weinberg and Rodrigo Zavala to record what would be the group's most successful album to that time. Music Musically, the album is a synthesis of the musical trends that were popular in 1967. The Boogaloo craze was at its highest and the Jala-Jala rhythm had begun to be known outside its native Puerto Rico. Also, Rock Music was at its highest with artists such as The Beatles at the top of the charts. All these ended up influencing the composition and recording of the Jala Jala y Boogaloo album. \\"Richie's Jala Jala\\" is a Jala-Jala song in which Richie's Piano riff is an imitation of the cowbell's sound. The song is notable for the protagonic role of the trumpets, played by Pedro Chaparro y Doc Cheatham, which gave the jala-jala genre a new sound. \\"Baby Don't You Cry\\" is a boogaloo number, with a heavy influence from Afro-American soul music. The use of English-language lyrics and soul- influenced singing is evidence of the American influence on the song. \\"Colombia's Boogaloo\\", the first of many songs the group will dedicate to the Colombian nation, is a mix of Cuban Son montuno with boogaloo. \\"Gentle Rain\\" is a cover of a bossa nova song by Luiz Bonf√°, translated to Spanish by Pancho Cristal and transformed into a bolero. \\"3 and 1 Mozambique\\" is an example of Mozambique Rhythm, and the hit single Bomba Camar√° is a salsa song. Lyrically the album shows both influences from Caribbean folklore as well as from American culture. For instance, \\"Stop, Look and Listen\\" lyrics deal with pacifism, a common theme in the Counterculture of the 1960s; In contrast, \\"Cabo E\\" references the deity Chang√≥ as well as other gods of the Santer√≠a, a syncretic religion of the Afro-Caribbean culture.

The film was a sequel to the previous year's very successful The Vulture, with Hulbert and Walters reprising their roles as hapless private detective Cedric Gull and his sidekick Stiffy respectively. Lesley Brook also features in both films, but in unrelated roles. Directorial duties passed to Neill as Ralph Ince, the director of The Vulture, had been killed in a road accident shortly after the film's release.

The film was not the box-office success its predecessor had been, and it was suggested that cinemagoers were beginning to tire of Hulbert's disguises and slapstick routines. Reviews were almost entirely negative in tone. Kine Weekly observed that the film held little appeal other than to Hulbert's die-hard fans and that \\"considerable expense has apparently gone in the production of gadgets and stunts for this picture which would have been better devoted to a more humorous story and funnier dialogue\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin found the film \\"absurd and confusing...the slapstick episodes are embarrassing\\". No print of The Viper is known to survive, and the film is included on the British Film Institute's \\"75 Most Wanted\\" list of missing British feature films.

The eighteenth tropical cyclone, sixteenth named storm, and ninth hurricane of the season, Paula developed from a low pressure area over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 11\\\\. Moving northwestward, it slowly organized and was upgraded to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Around midday on October 11, Paula made landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios at the border of Honduras and Nicaragua. In northeastern Honduras, strong winds destroyed several homes, while rainfall destroyed a few roads and dozens of buildings, include a school and a police station. Favorable conditions such as low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures allowed Paula to reach hurricane status early on October 12\\\\. Further intensification occurred, and the storm peaked with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) while curving northward on October 13\\\\. Due to Paula's small size, impact in Mexico was minor, mainly limited to light rainfall and winds. However, an American tourist drowned offshore Cozumel. After Paula attained its peak intensity on October 13, wind shear began to increase, causing the storm to weaken. The storm turned north- northeastward and fell to tropical storm intensity on October 14\\\\. Shortly thereafter, Paula made landfall in the Cuban province of Pinar del R√≠o. Early on October 15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression while moving eastward over Cuba, before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area about six hours later. In Cuba, rainfall was mostly beneficial. Strong winds, with gusts reaching 68 mph (109 km/h), left power outages in Pinar del R√≠o and Artemisa provinces. In the Havana area, a few homes were deroofed, while falling trees blocked many roads. Impact in the Florida Keys was minimal, limited to light rainfall and increased tides. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Nicole exited the Caribbean Sea and became extratropical on September 29, before dissipating on the next day, leaving behind a broad area of cyclonic circulation at the lower levels of the atmosphere. A southeasterly-moving cold front drifted from the Gulf of Mexico into the Caribbean Sea on October 5, and developed into a stationary north-south trough axis the following day. When a tropical wave that was associated with the previous development of Hurricane Otto traced into the Caribbean on October 7, there was an escalation in the convection associated with the system. Another tropical wave traveled from the Lesser Antilles to the western Caribbean between October 9 and 10. A large low-pressure area formed as the wave interacted with the trough; however, convection decreased on October 10. After convection increased again, the eighteenth tropical depression of the season developed at 0000 UTC on October 11, while situated about southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios, which is on the Honduras-Nicaragua border. About six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Paula. Steered northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge, the storm made landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) at 1200 UTC. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to significantly intensify, due to sea surface temperatures of , as well as light to moderate wind shear. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories until late on October 11, after satellite imagery, surface observations, and reconnaissance aircraft flight data confirmed the existence of a tropical cyclone; by this time, Paula was already a strong tropical storm. At 0000 UTC on October 12, Paula strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Satellite imagery during the afternoon of October 12 indicated that Paula was a small hurricane, consisting of a round area of deep convection, with an eye feature developing. However, at 1800 UTC on October 12, the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane while curving northward. Simultaneously, Paula attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . After reaching peak intensity late on October 12, strong upper-level west-southwesterly winds interacted with the system, prompting weakening. Paula was a very small hurricane; hurricane-force winds extended only from the center of Paula, while tropical storm-force winds extended from the same point. Paula moved north-northwest as the storm was impacted by a mid-latitude trough over the Gulf of Mexico. Increasing wind shear caused Paula to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane late on October 13. Satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft flights indicated that cloud pattern was disrupted and the mid- and low-level centers were becoming detached. Shortly thereafter, Lixion Avila of the National Hurricane Center remarked about the size of Paula, stating that, \\"a hurricane is crossing between the western tip of Cuba and eastern Yucatan...but without modern technology no one would know it was there\\". Drifting north-northeastward ahead of a mid-latitude trough, Paula weakened to a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on October 14\\\\. Three hours later, the storm made landfall between Santa Luc√≠a and Puerto Esperanza, in the Pinar del R√≠o Province of Cuba, with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). By 0600 UTC on October 15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression, while moving eastward over Cuba. Six hours later, the storm degenerated into a remnant low before completely dissipating early on October 16. Preparations and impact=Honduras and Nicaragua A weakening Hurricane Paula approaching Cuba on October 13 When the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Paula at 2100 UTC on October 11, a tropical storm warning was issued from Lim√≥n eastward to the Honduras-Nicaragua. The tropical storm warning was discontinued at 1200 UTC on the following day. The Comisi√≥n Permanente de Contingencias (COPECO) issued a red alert for Bay Islands late on October 11\\\\. Additionally, a yellow alert was issued for five departments, including Atl√°ntida, Col√≥n, Cort√©s, Olancho, and Yoro. A state of emergency was also declared for the Bay Islands Department on October 12 and was to remain in place for 48 hours. Along the northeastern coast of Honduras, several homes were destroyed by the storm. Dangerous conditions produced by Paula also forced officials to evacuate low-lying areas and shut down schools. Gale-force winds onshore resulted in the closure of the Puerto Lempira Airport. Throughout coastal districts, rainfall from the storm ranged from , resulting in widespread flooding. Winds from the storm were also estimated up to , and locals in La Mosquitia stated that the winds were stronger than those produced by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. In Puerto Lempira, four homes and two roads were destroyed by high winds and flooding. In the city, a total of of rain fell during Paula's passage on October 11. More than a dozen structures in Cauquira, including a school and police station were also damaged by flood waters. Along the coast, waves up to pounded beaches. In Nicaragua, the storm produced heavy rainfall in some areas, though otherwise, impact is unknown. Mexico and Belize In Mexico, a tropical storm warning was issued from Chetumal to Punta Gruesa at 2100 UTC on October 11\\\\. Simultaneously, a hurricane warning was posted from Punta Gruesa to Canc√∫n, including Cozumel. Early on October 12, another tropical storm warning was issued from Cabo Catoche to San Felipe. Around that time, the hurricane warning was modified to include Punta Gruesa to Cabo Catoche. Later on October 12, the tropical storm warning Chetumal to Punta Gruesa was discontinued, as was the hurricane warning from Punta Gruesa to Punta Allen early on the following day. At 1500 UTC on October 13, the tropical storm warning was revised to include Canc√∫n to San Felipe. Simultaneously, the hurricane warning from Punta Allen to Cabo Catoche was canceled. Late on October 13, the tropical storm warning from Canc√∫n to San Felipe. Officials assured tourists their safety and did not issue evacuations; however, about 1,560 locals were evacuated from Isla Holbox and Isla Contoy. Roughly 28,800 people were estimated to be visiting the region, most of whom were in Canc√∫n. Between October 12 and 13, transportation officials canceled 22 international flights to and from Canc√∫n. Off the coast of Cozumel, an American citizen drowned after being overcome by rough seas produced by the storm. Only light to moderate rain fell along the northeastern coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula; throughout October 13, of rain had fallen in Canc√∫n and winds gusted up to . Despite the storm's close passage to the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Paula's small size resulted in very little impact on land. According to Quintana Roo Governor F√©lix Gonz√°lez Canto, the storm left no structural or vegetative damage. Following the hurricane's passage, the red alerts issued for four Mexican states were discontinued and ports were re- opened. In Belize, a tropical storm watch was issued for the entire country at 0000 UTC on October 12\\\\. It was discontinued about nine hours later. The Government of Belize suspended school classes, as the buildings were being used as storm shelters. Voluntary evacuations were recommended for residents of the coastal cayes. A small craft warning was declared along the coast and advised marines to take precautions. At Punta Negra, the National Guard of Belize evacuated residents on October 13. However, no impact was reported in Belize. Cuba and Florida In Cuba, a hurricane warning was issued for Pinar del R√≠o Province - the westernmost province - at 2100 UTC on October 12\\\\. After Paula weakened to a tropical storm on October 14, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning. Early on October 15, the tropical storm warning was discontinued. Officials recommended that those residing in low-lying to evacuate for higher ground. The tobacco plants in Pinar del Rio, which are used to make Cuban cigars, were protected. In Cuba, the outer bands of Paula brought heavy localized rains, especially to the Isla de la Juventud where of precipitation was recorded on October 12. Heavy rain fell across much of Pinar del R√≠o Province. In Cape San Antonio, of rain fell by the morning of October 14. In some areas of western Cuba, the heavy precipitation was beneficial to reservoirs, grain crops, tubers and vegetables. The highest winds recorded during the storm's passage were measured in Puerto Esperanza at . Strong winds left power outages in Vi√±ales, La Palma, Bah√≠a Honda, and San Crist√≥bal. Near Havana, a few homes lost their roofs and power was lost to many homes, mostly as a result of a precautionary power shutdown. High winds also downed numerous trees, blocking many roads. Along the coast, rough seas damaged parts of the capital city's seawall. Some streets near the shore were left under of water at the height of the storm. By the afternoon of October 15, emergency crews began clearing debris left behind by the storm. A small portion of banana crops in the Havana area suffered losses. Throughout the country, Paula resulted in relatively little damage. In Florida, a tropical storm watch was issued from Dry Tortugas to Craig Key at 1500 UTC on October 13\\\\. The tropical storm watch was discontinued early on October 15. In the Florida Keys, the outer bands of Paula brought moderate rainfall and increased surf. A total of of rain in Key West had fallen between October 13 and 15. Two waterspouts were reported offshore the Upper Florida Keys on October 14. Following the threat of a landfalling storm in Florida, orange juice futures dropped by 8.9%, reaching their lowest value since September 9\\\\. Values for delivery fell to $1.409 a pound (453 grams) at the worst of the downturn.

In the course of fighting a lengthy guerrilla war against the Dutch colonisation of Sumatra from 1878 onwards, he was killed in a skirmish with Dutch troops in 1907. He was declared a National Hero of Indonesia in 1961 for his resistance to Dutch colonialism. Biography Batak warriors in traditional dress, ca. 1870. Sisingamangaraja XII was born Patuan Besar Ompu Pulo Batu in Bakkara, Tapanuli, in 1849. He was the successor to his father Sisingamangaraja XI, who died in 1867. The title Si Singamangarajah which was used by the family dynasty of Marga Sinambela means \\"The Great Lion King\\": (1) the (honorific particle Si from sanskrit Sri) (2) Great King (manga raja from sanskrit maharaja), (3) Lion (singa). Since the Batak see themselves in their mythology as descendants of divine blood (all Margas have the mythological god-king Si Raja Batak as their first ancestor), no feudalism structure could develop in that parmalim faith based concept of ethnic exceptionalism throughout Batak history. The king was merely seen as a ruler among equals (\\"primus inter pares\\" or in Batak law/adat \\"dalihan na tolo\\" http://melayuonline.com/eng/culture/dig/2598/marga-family-and-kinship-in-the- mind-of-batak-toba-people-north-sumatra, in Batak philosophy everyone is equal, i.e. must behave and be treated like a king (raja).) and the South East Asian aristocratic lords, the Datuk (in Batak: Datu), did justify their leadership role within society by fulfilling their secular and religious tasks. They had for example to preside over courtship trials in cases of broken law, organize administrative affairs and similarly oversee in the function as a priest class all religious ceremonies within the village or territory of rulership (kedatuan); but there were, compared to the European nobility (Datu is equivalent to a European count or countess) and its characteristic excessive privileges, no further special rights beyond those functionally substantiated at hand. Si Singamangaraja XII was the last in a line of figures known as parmalim (religious leaders) who were regarded as divine kings and incarnations of Batara Guru, the Javanese version of the god Shiva. The Sisingamangaraja was believed to have powers such as the ability to drive away evil spirits, call forth the rain and control rice-growing. He was not normally seen as a political figure, but when Dutch colonists and missionaries began penetrating north Sumatra from the 1850s onwards both Sisingamangaraja XI and XII became the focus of Batak resistance to colonial rule. Although they were not personally anti-Christian, the two Sisingamangarajas faced pressure to act from traditional list Batak chiefs and the neighbouring Sultanate of Aceh, which was at war with the Dutch from 1873. Resistance against the Dutch In February 1878, Sisingamangaraja XII held a religious ceremony to rally the Bataks behind him in a war of resistance against the Dutch. His forces attacked Dutch outposts in Bakal Batu, Tarutung, but were defeated. He regrouped and launched a fresh offensive in 1883‚Äì84 with Acehnese aid, attacking the Dutch at Uluan and Balige in May 1883 and in Tangga Batu in 1884. The Dutch mounted a harsh response, torturing and killing Bataks suspected of being followers of Sisingamangaraja XII, as well as burning houses and imposing punitive taxes. They offered rewards for information on his whereabouts but were unable to capture him. In 1904, Dutch forces under Lt Col Gotfried Coenraad Ernst van Daalen attacked Tanah Gayo and some areas around Lake Toba in order to break the Batak resistance. Sisingamangaraja XII's forces resorted to guerrilla warfare and evaded the Dutch troops. The Dutch reinforced their troops and weapons before launching another offensive in 1907 against the remainder of Sisingamangaraja XII's forces in the Toba region. A battle was fought at Pak-pak between the Dutch, led by Captain Hans Christoffel, and Sisingamangaraja's troops. On 17 June 1907 Sisingamangaraja XII was killed in a clash at Dairi along with his daughter Lopian and his sons, Patuan Nagari and Patuan Anggi. He was buried in Tarutung, then moved to Balige, and later moved to Samosir Island. Legacy 1,000-rupiah banknote. In 1961 Sisingamangaraja XII was declared a \\"National Hero of Indonesia\\" ‚Äì specifically a \\"Hero of the Struggle for Freedom\\" (Pahlawan Perjuangan Kemerdekaan) ‚Äì by the Indonesian government under Presidential Decree number 590. He's also the namesake of \\"Sisingamangaraja\\" road in Jakarta where couple of important buildings are located, such as the ASEAN Secretariat building, id:Universitas Al Azhar Indonesia and several government owned buildings.

History of the Station  Sister station (supplementary Licence) for 2BH in Broken Hill NSW Originally broadcast on the 106.9 FM frequency until a transmitter upgrade and power increase moved the station to 96.5. It was broadcasting on both frequencies during a 12-month transition, and still can be heard on 106.9 within a 2 km radius of the station.. Founding Owner - Far West Radio Pty Ltd owned by David Tunkin and John Curtis The launch of the station in 1993 saw a large parade in the main street of Broken Hill to a soundtrack highlighting the new sound of the FM station using the slogan \\"Putting the Rock back in the Hill\\" a reference to the mining history of Broken Hill. During the first few years of the station, the Friday Night \\"Coca-Cola Request Line\\" was a popular program with live callers answering a topical question and requesting their favourite songs with a weekly prize from the sponsor given out at the end of each show. The theme music for the show introduction was the Theme to Beverly Hills, 90210 as this was the popular show of the time with the audience. The station was one of the first in Australia to be run under Automation using a system called \\"Systemation\\" designed in the US and used exclusively in Australia by Far West Radio Pty Ltd. The hardware was operated by a Commodore 64 computer and serial ports and consisted of a hard disk DOS program to play \\"Voice tracks\\" and commercials and a rack of up to 14 Super VHS 4 track players that contained 4 stereo tracks on a 240-minute tape, the tapes for each category were changed daily to \\"rotate\\" the playlist. Current Hit back announces and a dedicated \\"time call\\" deck was also in the system to play at pre-programmed times. Eventually the video tape players were replaced with hard disk recorded music using a software program called \\"SALSA\\" which was DOS based and could only record in real time, but this places all music, voice tracks, commercials, and long form programs, satellite feeds via the one computer (in 1994 it was a Pentium 90 machine with 256 mg of RAM). This machine was affectionately known by the staff as \\"Cyril\\". In the late 1990s the station used a unique Promotional Prize car, especially for Broken Hill, it had a red \\"Purvis Eureka\\" Kit car, which was a fiberglass Ferrari style body on a VW chassis and mechanicals, whilst it always drew a lot of attention from listeners when making appearances, due to its pop up roof with no doors, some was unwarranted especially when it suffered the 40 degree summer days in Broken Hill, which was not kind to the rear air-cooled engine. The vehicle participated in the local \\"Pro Hart's Rally for SIDS\\" with Jonathan Wright and Steve Baker dressed as Batman and Robin participating in the fund raiser for raising money for SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) and receiving a special hand painted PRO HART painted trophy for participating. Throughout the 90s and early 2000s networked shows including Take 40 Australia with Barry Bissell, Rock 40 Countdown with Mike Hammond, Party Hard with Ugly Phil O'Neill, were all aired. Locally produced on air features included: 9@9 workday kickstart, Midday Mini Concert, 80s lunchbox, Club Retro with Steve Baker, The Hot 8 at 8 nightly countdown, Double shot Thursdays were all part of the early days of the station with a local pizza store giving away free pizza party lunches every day as part of a mornings request show where listeners faxed the station with their requests which were read on air ( a 90s version of digital interaction).

Rouvas had long been considered a fashion and stylistic icon in Greece, known for having several trademark looks, such as various jackets, leather pants, and aviator sunglasses.Sakis Rouvas This Is My Live Minos EMI (2007) He received accolades such as Celebrity with Best Personal Style from MAD TV, one of the two musicians awarded for fashion, as well as Best Dressed Artist in a Video in 2006 and Fashion Icon of the Year in 2010 at the MAD Video Music Awards. He has been cited as influencing fashion among musicians and many other artists have been cited to imitate his personal style. Rouvas has been the first Greek artist to market themselves through merchandise, and with the launch of the Sakis Rouvas Collection he became the first Greek artist to have his own fashion label. It further expanded the entrepreneurial image Rouvas had established for himself within the period of 2009-2010, having launched business ventures such as a restaurant, nightclub, beauty salon franchise, and film and television production company. For the creation of his fashion label, Rouvas teamed up with several professional fashion designers and stylists to create the looks, while he also had creative input in the design department, choosing styles, giving his ideas on and approving designs. Rouvas' partner since 2003, supermodel Katia Zygouli, gave some input on the female merchandise half of the designs. The premise of the brand is to exhibit Rouvas' own personal style and tastes, and is an attempt to mix high-end fashion with affordable prices that the majority of the public would be able to purchase. According to its publications, the brand's top priority is about the comfort of the wearer, as well as aesthetics, beauty, and elegance, and attention to detail. Rouvas summarized: > \\"I wanted to create an entire collection that would express my aesthetics, > to answer to the [financial] needs of the current times, without making > discounts in quality and to be loved by the consumers who will find a > distinct perception of fashion that everyone can interpret according to > their own style and persona.\\" Marketing Rumours of Rouvas beginning his own fashion label began in 2010; at the MAD Video Music Awards 2010, where Rouvas won Fashion Icon of the Year, fashion designer and stylist Lakis Gavalas, whom presented the award to him, hinted at the label's launch by asking the entertainer his thoughts about launching one.MAD Video Music Awards. MAD TV. Airdate: 14 June 2010 The label is exclusively available at Greek department store retailer Sprider Store, Greece's largest multinational department store franchise. Rouvas officially announced the label's launch at the 27 July Corinth stop of his 2010 summer tour. The line was inaugurated on 16 September at the Vogue Fashion's Night Out at the Sprider Store on Ermou Street 54 in downtown Athens, where fans and reporters gathered in the street. The line is available in stores as of October 21, 2010. The brand caters equally to both sexes and is marketed towards a contemporary young adult market. It is part of Sprider Store's investment strategy amid the economic crisis to help fight against it.

On 26 July the official teaser for the brand was released, featuring Rouvas in a design room, approving designs and trying on the clothing. Rouvas discussed the label on the premiere of Vrady Me Ton Petro Kostopoulo on 6 October, where he joked that the reason why he decided to create it was because he had no more clothing as he is constantly ripping his at concerts. In October 2010, a television commercial for the line was released. Reception Madata praised Rouvas' marketing innovation saying that he \\"demonstrated again that he is the one and only superstar in the country and a role model for many young people\\" as well as adding that \\"[f]urthermore, he has nothing to be envious of foreign stars who put their signatures on perfumes, clothing, accessories, and anything else you can imagine\\".

Personal life Manuel Gregorio Argerich was born in Buenos Aires in 1835. His brother, Juan Antonio, was born in 1840 and was, like Manuel, a key figure during the cholera and yellow fever epidemics. He helped organize the commission to organize a plan to manage the epidemic with Jos√© Roque P√©rez. He was a professor of surgery and director of an orphan's home. They were descendants of Dr. Cosme Argerich. Argerich married and had children. Jos√© Manuel Estrada, a friend and writer said of his home life: \\"He requested his family to act as a clear and transparent sky, under which to calm his violent temper; he loved his young wife passionately, the only person under whose refuge he found peace and a tranquil candor - the soft love and holy happiness that his troubled soul needed. His love for his children was intense, incorporating the imagination of youth and the discretion of providence.\\" He was a member of the Buenos Aires Freemasons lodge. Medical career=Battle of Caseros As medical doctor, he was conscripted as a medical officer into the army] under the command of Argentine caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas, then governor of Buenos Aires. He cared for the wounded and injured soldiers during the Battle of Caseros in which Rosas' authoritarian regime was finally defeated. Following the battle, which led to flight of Rosas to Great Britain, Argerich was documented to have stayed in the field voluntarily after Rosas' defeat, treating not only wounded soldiers and fellow officers formerly under Rosas' command, but also Urquiza's soldiers stricken by smallpox, with complete indifference as to which uniform his patients wore. Buenos Aires Epidemics Juan Manuel Blanes, Episodio de la fiebre amarilla, 1871, was made as a tribute to Dr. Manuel Argerich. A year after Urquiza was assassinated, Argerich treated the victims of Buenos Aires' epidemics of Cholera in 1867 and Yellow Fever in 1871. Argerich was identified as one of the \\"ministering angels\\" who was not part of the mass exodus from the city, but stayed behind at his peril to tend to the sick who remained in Buenos Aires. He is depicted treating a patient alongside Dr. Roque Perez in Juan Manuel Blanes' iconic 1871 portrait, Yellow Fever of the great Buenos Aires epidemic of 1871. Although he was committed to his responsibilities as a physician, he was conflicted, he said to Jos√© Manuel Estrada 3 days before he died: \\"My Children! My Wife! Have I the right to defy death and risk abandoning them forever?\\" Writer He is also remembered as a pioneer of the Spanish theatrical genre known as the Zarzuela. Argerich wrote the lyrics for Los Consejos de Don Javier, or The Advice of Don Javier, and was put to music in 1892 by Felice Lebano. It was first played at the Buenos Aires' Apollo Theater on September 1, 1892. In anticipation of the premier, La Naci√≥n issued a review on July 14, 1892 stating that the music by Lebano, in particular, made the work innovative, Zarzuela music. It was one of the first popular works of Zarzuela theater in Argentina. Death During the great yellow fever epidemic of 1871, Argerich, tirelessly continued his care of the sick until finally succumbing to the disease on May 25, 1871, the 61st anniversary of the Argentine Revolution. He was one of the 13,614 victims of the Buenos Aires Yellow Fever epidemic. Three days later, at his funeral, his contemporary Jose Manuel Estrada, Argentine writer, eulogized him, a portion of which is translated from Spanish: Argerich is buried in Buenos Aires at the La Chacarita Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio de la Chacarita). His gravesite was declared a National Monument in 1970 and is a highlight of prominent graves in a tour of that cemetery.

That year he was appointed president of Western University, a historically black university near Kansas City supported by the A.M.E. Conference. He brought new energy to the school, gaining legislative support to add industrial education to the school. To support the new programs in training for agriculture and mechanical trades, he had facilities constructed, including new dormitories.

Washington Papers, University of Illinois, History Cooperative After being consecrated as a bishop in 1920,\\"All AME Bishops\\", AME Conference Vernon soon left for South Africa, where he worked as a missionary in the Transvaal district for four years. The AME Church had been successful in building congregations among the indigenous peoples in South Africa. As early as the late nineteenth century, it was helping students come to the United States for college. At the 1932 AME General Conference, members brought charges against three bishops: William Tecumseh Vernon, Joshua Jones, and William Decker Johnson. Ultimately, Vernon and Jones were suspended from their duties for misuse of conference funds. In addition, there were complaints that Vernon had been too close to some of his women parishioners. This was at a period when there had been several scandals among senior clergy in the AME and other churches, and its prestige was declining. In 1933 during the Great Depression, after the A.M.E. Church withdrew its support from Western University, the state provided funding. The governor appointed Vernon as head of the industrial department. He appointed a strong faculty and succeeded in getting its accreditation restored before stepping down in 1936.http://www3.wycokck.org/assets/F0B22966-AE14-4E05-A461-2372FE4C6E03.doc Books  Vernon wrote two books on race and politics: * The Upbuilding of a Race: or The Rise of a Great People, a compilation of sermons, addresses and writings on education, the race question and public affairs (1904) * What the American Negro expects of World-wide Democracy: A statement of the Negro's Case and Cause (1919) References Category:African Methodist Episcopal bishops Category:20th-century Methodist bishops Category:Methodist missionaries in South Africa Category:American Methodist missionaries Category:1944 deaths Category:1871 births Category:Kansas Republicans Category:Oklahoma Republicans Category:Mississippi Republicans Category:Tennessee Republicans Category:American expatriates in South Africa ","title":"William Tecumseh Vernon"},{"id":"29137113","text":"The 1st Illinois General Assembly, consisting of the Illinois Senate and the Illinois House of Representatives, met from October 4, 1818, to March 31, 1819, during the first two years of Shadrach Bond's governorship, at The Kaskaskia State House.

The attraction, technically a yard haunt, showcases a mixture of age-old tricks such as Pepper's ghost, and advanced special effects and multi-channel audio.  History  The show began as a simple yard display of tombstones and a few yard lights. Beginning in 2001, effects similar to The Haunted Mansion ride from Disney appeared in the display along with many Haunted Mansion soundtrack elements. As the attraction proved popular, the show's producers decided to create a unique story. Lori Merkle Ford created the basic story line in the spring of 2007, which revolved around a young Hollywood Starlet of the 1930s who had just married a shady Hollywood screenwriter. Ed Valentine, a prominent television screenwriter, was contracted to develop the script, and pre-production began in full earnest in June 2007. Christopher Hoag, an Emmy-nominated composer, joined the production team shortly thereafter, and about a month later the fully developed score and story were finished.https://www.westcoaster.net/home/2017/11/8/house-at- haunted-hill-2017-review Corey Burton, famous for his rendition of Paul Frees at The Disney Haunted Mansion, came on board to provide the voice of \\"Jack\\", who is the main narrator of the show, whose character is manifested as a giant talking pumpkin. The show was created and produced by Matt Ford and Lori Merkle Ford. Matt Ford is an Emmy winning lighting designer based in Los Angeles. Lori Merkle Ford is a singer, actor and dancer based in Los Angeles. The show will reappear in 2019.  The Attraction  The House at Haunted Hill is a high-tech yard haunt at a private residence in Woodland Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. The show has run yearly since 2000, usually the last three days of October. The attraction differs in a few ways from other seasonal haunted attractions. The main difference is the show is a \\"walk by\\" haunt. People view the show along the fence-line of the street (the city began closing the street to vehicular traffic in 2009, to facilitate the large crowds). The other difference is the show is scripted but does not use live actors, instead relying on video projections and animatronics. In style, the show is more of a \\"ghost show\\", lacking any sort of blood, shock or gore. Technology The show is a recorded show that repeats every fifteen minutes, similar to many amusement park rides. Instead of live actors, the show uses high-definition projections of the characters to tell the story using several magician's illusions such as Pepper's ghost along with other high-tech projection and lighting methods. The show is controlled by an Alcorn McBride show control system that is synchronized to SMPTE time code. The show control system coordinates the motion control subsystems, animatronics, lighting, and special effects. The show also makes extensive use of Projection Mapping provided by the company Spectral Illusions. The sound system consists of a twenty-four channel sound track with speakers strategically placed along the attraction. The lighting system is controlled by a Vari Lite Virtuoso and makes extensive use of LED and ultraviolet lighting technology Characters * Jack - The Narrator (played by Corey Burton) * Julietta LaRue, a young Hollywood starlet (played by Heather Marie Marsden) * Billy Valentine, her new husband (played by Todd Fournier) *Lily, Billy's deceased ex-wife (played by Lori Merkle Ford) * Moira, Billy's deceased daughter (played Alexendra Vicich) * Snapper Bixby, a Hollywood Paparazzo (played by Neil Patrick Harris)  References  Category:Dark rides Category:Ghosts in popular culture Category:Haunted attractions (simulated) Category:Animatronic attractions ","title":"The House at Haunted Hill"},{"id":"29137151","text":"Reynaldo Gonzalez Lopez (14 September 1948 ‚Äì 4 July 2015) was a Cuban-born member on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).Olympic.org He served the IOC from 1995 representing Cuba.

It is located along the east side of the Kuchurhan Reservoir on the border with Transnistria in Moldova. Population: The villages of Selz (named after Seltz in Alsace) and Kandel were established at this location along the Kuchurhan River in 1808 by Roman Catholic German and Alsatian (French citizens) immigrants to the Kutschurgan Valley, then part of the Russian Empire. It received its present name after the remaining German residents were driven from the area by the advancing Soviet army in 1944. History Lymanske, as well as many of the surrounding settlements, originally began as a German agricultural colony. Germans began settling in southern Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula in the late 18th century, but the bulk of immigration and settlement occurred during the Napoleonic period, from 1800 onward, with a concentration in the years 1803 to 1805.see preface and historical background in Dr Karl Stumpp's, The Emigration from Germany to Russia in the Years 1763 to 1862 (translated from the German original and published by the American Historical Society of Germans from Russia, Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.A., 1973) At the time, southern Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire. Designated New Russia, and often colloquially South Russia (or S√ºdrussland by its German-speaking inhabitants), these lands had been annexed by the Russian Empire during the reign of Catherine the Great after successful wars against the Ottoman Empire (1768‚Äì1774) and the Crimean Khanate (1783). The first German settlers arrived in 1798 from Southwestern Germany and Alsace, France. Tsar Alexander I (grandson of Catherine the Great), invited German settlers to develop the land in the newly-acquired territory north of the Black Sea. The Catholic Germans who settled Lymanske during the reign Alexander I were assured numerous \\"special privileges.\\" These included: free land, exemption from military and civil service, tax-free loans, local self- government, and freedom of religion. As they developed the area, the German settlers were allowed to maintain their German language, folkways, and identity as German colonists.  Selz  Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Selz (beginning of 20th century) The colony of Selz was established in 1798. Groups of settlers arrived in two parties in 1808 under the leadership of Jakob Steinh√§user and Michael Scherr. The land for the settlers was obtained by Duke de Richelieu from three Russian families. The original colonists consisted of 100 families, 205 males and 196 females. The colonists came from various German provinces. From the province of Lower Alsace there were 95 families with 196 males and 186 females. From Prussia, there were 2 families with 2 males and 2 females. From Austria, there was one family with one man and one woman. The homeland of the two remaining families is unknown. The Kutschurgan District office was located in Selz until 1871 and covered the colonies of Selz, Kandel, Baden, Strassburg, Mannheim and Elsass. In 1908 Selz housed the Volost Office for only Selz and Kandel. The other colonies established separate Volost Offices for themselves. Selz also had the first parish church in the Kutschurgan District, the parish having been founded in 1811. Prior to that time, colonists were served from Josephsthal. In 1821 the first church was built, but by 1830 the building was in need of repair and was remodeled on numerous occasions over the years. In 1901 the spacious, beautiful Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was completed.  Kandel  Holy Trinity Cathedral in Kandel (1934) The village of Kandel rests on the banks of the Kutschurgan Liman. Before the first German Catholic arrivals in 1808 and 1809, however, a Gypsy (Roma) settlement stood in the vicinity. The colonists first arrived in July 1808. Kandel was apportioned 24,923 acres of land. According to the 1811 census, Kandel had 104 families, numbering 480 souls. Kandel did not have its own church until 1828. Villagers would attend services at Selz, 2 miles north of Kandel. The first mayor of Kandel was Sebastian Sahli. Like its namesake in the ancestral town in Palatinate, Germany, Kandel consisted of a long street which stretched almost two kilometers. In later times a shorter parallel street was added and became known as Bergstrasse. In the centennial year of 1908 Kandel had a population of 2,522, which represented a six-fold increase in the course of 100 years. There were 269 house and farmyards which provided accommodation for more than 350 families. Apart from grain farming, the people of Kandel carried on extensive truck-farming and viniculture on 150 acres of garden land; the fruit orchards that covered over 275 acres produced excellent crops of apricots, plums, and cherries for home consumption and for the market. Kandel also had 77 artisans and craftsmen who produced a variety of agricultural implements in iron and wood; there were also many basket weavers and broom makers. The beautiful stone Trinity Church, was built in 1892 and was consecrated by Bishop Anton Zerr. Kandel had two large schools, with 4 teachers for the 375 and more school children of the village.  1900 ‚Äì 1944  Prior to the turn of the century, a wave of emigration of the Russian German community began after the reforms of Alexander II. In 1871, he repealed the open-door immigration policy of his ancestors. The resulting disaffection motivated many Russian Germans, especially members of traditionally dissenting churches, to migrate to the United States and Canada, while many Catholics chose Brazil and Argentina. The Russian Civil War of 1919 hit the Selz people especially hard when during early August the farmers attempted a three-day stand against General Grigori Kotovski‚Äôs Bolshevist cavalry regiment and finally lost. The Bolsheviks took revenge by massacring 111 men and women of Selz. During the time of the Great Terror of 1937/1938 the population was reduced by 15 percent. This great loss caused the government to keep the results of a 1939 census secret.Selz Residents in World War I and their End in World War II Germans from Russian Heritage Collection, NDSU. Retrieved 11 August 2017 During early August of 1941 the German air force staged air attacks on Selz, Kandel and Baden, two people lost their lives. Explosive and fire bombs destroyed homes and stables. In two villages, livestock also became victims of the air attacks. The residents hid in cellars and camps for several days, until on Sunday, August 10, Romanian soldiers and a mounted officer arrived from the South and marched first into Kandel, then into the other villages, and declared their sovereign rule over the settlements. They were followed immediately by an SS-unit arriving on foot. Within two weeks, the SS identified all leaders of the collectives, leaders of village councils, village activists, as well as children from mixed German-Jewish families and executed them in secrecy.Selz Residents in World War I and their End in World War II Germans from Russian Heritage Collection, NDSU. Retrieved 11 August 2017 From 1942 on, the villages came under political administration by Police Commissariat 23. The villagers restored their churches as much as possible, and religious services held by Catholic military clergy from Romania were permitted, but only under military supervision. Once again, the language of commerce was German, and school instruction was conducted with the help of textbooks imported from Germany. A March 12, 1944 announcement ordered the population to prepare for ‚Äúadministrative resettlement.‚Äù The people of Kandel, initially heading toward Franzfeld, were the first to leave. The Selz people‚Äôs turn came only six days later. Because the authorities had abandoned the Selz residents, they wandered around for days until some men discovered a ferry near Mayaki. After two thirds of the people and wagons had reached the western side successfully, a Soviet artillery grenade hit the ferry and sank people and horses. 76 other wagons and 450 Selz residents were captured and sentenced to life in labor camps, while the women and children were deported to the northern Urals. The formerly unified village communities of the Selz colonist district thus ceased to exist. It was the end of their 136-year history.Selz Residents in World War I and their End in World War II Germans from Russian Heritage Collection, NDSU.

Instead, he said, believers should \\"look within the Seventh-day Adventist Church, to humble pastors, evangelists, Biblical scholars, leaders, and departmental directors who can provide evangelistic methods and programs that are based on solid Biblical principles and The Great Controversy theme.\\" He, along with others (such as retired Adventist pastor Rick Howard), outlined the dangers of spiritual formation to the attention of the Adventist church. Many other Adventists, such as Pastors Hal Mayer and Derek Morris, raised concerns as well. The official church paper, the Adventist Review, published articleshttp://archives.adventistreview.org/article/4614/archives/issue-2011-1522/formed- in-christ outlining the effects of spiritualism coming into the Christian Church through the teachings of spiritual formation.http://amazingdiscoveries.org/AD-Magazine-Archive- Summer-2011-Spiritual-Formation Howard wrote The Omega Rebellion, in which he warned of the dangers associated with the ‚Äúemerging church‚Äù movement. He identified the teachings of spiritual formation, contemplative prayer, postmodern spirituality, the meditation steeped in Eastern mysticism as dangerous.http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-omega-rebellion-rick- howard/1029286721?ean=2940014349840 Church members were also cautioned to use discernment in worship styles: \\"Use Christ-centered, Bible-based worship and music practices in church services,\\" Wilson said. \\"While we understand that worship services and cultures vary throughout the world, don't go backwards into confusing pagan settings where music and worship become so focused on emotion and experience that you lose the central focus on the Word of God. All worship, however simple or complex should do one thing and one thing only: lift up Christ and put down self.\\"http://news.adventist.org/en/archive/articles/2010/07/03/wilson-calls- adventists-to-go-forward Views on Last Generation Theology Elder Wilson is a supporter of traditional Adventist beliefs (such as those in the Great Controversy theme) which inform Last Generation Theology. He presented LGT principles, in his first address to the 59th GC session in Atlanta on July 3, 2010, and in his Divine Worship message to the GYC convention on January 1, 2011.www.3angelstube.com/video p. 85.The Latter Rain prepares the \\"last generation, Early Writings, \\"At that time the Latter Rain, or refreshing from the presence of the Lord, will come, to give power to the loud voice of the third angel, and prepare the saints to stand in the period when the seven last plagues shall be poured out.\\" Also, \\"Early Writings, p. 71. \\"I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful, and were looking to the 'time of refreshing' and the latter rain to fit them to stand in the day of the Lord, and to live in His sight. 0, how many I saw in the time of trouble without a shelter! They had neglected the needful preparation; therefore they could not receive the refreshing that all must have to fit them to live in the sight of a Holy God. Those who refuse to be hewed by the prophets, and fail to purify their souls in obeying the whole truth and who are willing to believe that their condition is far better than it really is, will come up to the time of the falling of the plagues, and then see that they needed to be hewed and squared for the building. But there will be no time then to do it, and no Mediator to plead their cause before the Father.\\" and Testimonies to Ministers, p. 506. \\"The latter rain, falling near the close of the season, ripens the grain and prepares it for the sickle. The Lord employs these operations of nature to represent the work of the Holy Spirit. As the dew and the rain are given first to cause the seed to germinate, and then to ripen the harvest, so the Holy Spirit is given to carry forward from one stage to another the process of spiritual growth. The ripening of the grain represents the completion of the work of God's grace in the soul. By the power of the Holy Spirit the moral image of God is to be perfected in the character. We are to be wholly transformed into the likeness of Christ.\\" In Wilson's sermon at the 2014 Annual Council he stated,\\"Time on this Earth is short. Probation is closing soon. Preparation to see God face to face by repentance and forsaking of sin needs to be done now. The Great Controversy, page 425, explains that: 'Those who are living upon the Earth when the intercession of Christ shall cease in the sanctuary above, are to stand in the sight of a holy God without a mediator. Their robes must be spotless, their characters must be purified from sin by the blood of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their own diligent effort, they must be conquerors in the battle with evil.' However, do not misinterpret this quote and think for a minute that you do not need Christ and that by your own works you will gain salvation. Seventh-day Adventists believe that only through the grace and righteousness of Christ do we have eternal life. However, when probation closes, the work of mediation is over. Your character will be set and your destiny eternally decided. That is why every day we need to be revived and reformed through our Bible study and prayer connection with Christ. We must receive His all-encompassing righteousness through justification and sanctification as daily, through His power, we become more and more like Him.\\" www.adventistreview.org/church-news/ Women's ordination controversy A decades-long debate over whether or not to ordain women as Adventist pastors came to a head, at the General Conference Session in San Antonio, Texas, in July 2015. The General Conference, in 2013, had commissioned a Theology of Ordination Study Committee (TOSC) to arrive at a consensus on the issue. The committee came up with three different positions: (1), that women's ordination was unbiblical; (2) that it was biblical, and (3) that women could be appropriately ordained, wherever culturally acceptable. The policy prior to that session was to ordain men, and commission women. A proposal to allow divisions of the world church to ordain women was rejected by the GC delegates in San Antonio. Wilson proclaimed that the vote meant \\"we maintain the current policy\\" (male pastors ordained, women pastors commissioned). Several union conference presidents and constituency sessions maintained that the vote did not prohibit their level of church leadership from ordaining women, and proceeded to do so. The General Conference then began discussing how to deal with these 'non-compliant' unions. A \\"Study of Church Governance and Unity\\" was written in 2016, and later rewritten to modify certain language, which was regarded by some church members and leaders as demonizing conscientious supporters of women's ordination. At the 2016 General Conference Annual Council, it was voted to give the unions a 'year of grace' to comply with the 2015 San Antonio vote (as interpreted by the General Conference). A Unity in Mission Oversight Committee was created, to coordinate discussions between union conferences and the GC. At the 2017 Annual Council, a proposed loyalty oath, for GC Executive Committee members, was referred back to the Unity in Mission Oversight Committee for another year.

History  The It≈ç-≈åkawa River is a primary source of drinking water for the city of It≈ç, on the eastern coast of the Izu Peninsula. However, the area is a region of heavy rains, and is prone to typhoons. The 1958 Kanogawa Typhoon caused widespread flooding and damage to property in the It≈ç area. From the 1960s, the area around It≈ç began to develop as a bedroom community for Atami, as well as a popular vacation destination due to its beaches, hot spring resorts and ease of access to Tokyo. In 1972, a project office was established and construction begun by a consortium consisting of Kajima Construction and Kumagai Gumi. Due to the geography of the site, a rock-fill dam design with a central spillway and a height of 63 meters was selected. The estimated completion time was 1983. However, due to difficulties arising from transporting the necessary stones from distant locations, work was not completed until 1989. Although styled as a 'multi-purpose dam', the dam has no associated hydroelectric power facilities, and its primary function is flood control and the supply of drinking water. The reservoir impounded was named in 1987, and is a popular recreational area for sports fishermen and bird- watching.

The camp, which operated from 20 to 27 April 1940, also held Norwegians accused of collaborating with the Germans or the Norwegians fascists led by Vidkun Quisling. In the morning of 27 April 1940, the camp was evacuated due to German forces advancing in the area, and the prisoners were marched westwards across the mountains to Sogn. By the time the prisoners and guards reached Sogn after an exhausting march, the resistance in South Norway was collapsing. The prisoners were soon abandoned and left to themselves by the Norwegian guards. Establishment Nazi Germany invaded the neutral country of Norway on 9 April 1940. Fighting ensued across large areas of the country, and German military personnel started falling into Norwegian hands. This led to a need for facilities behind the front lines to contain the prisoners. In Eastern Norway the prisoners taken by the Norwegian 2nd Division were initially placed in the auxiliary prison at Sel in Oppland. Due to capacity issues this initial solution to the prisoner situation soon proved inadequate.M√∏lmen 1996: 322 The task of establishing a more permanent facility for German prisoners-of-war in Eastern Norway was given to the 66-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Lars Dannevig.M√∏lmen 1996: 323 Dannevig had been in the Norwegian capital of Oslo when the Germans invaded on 9 April 1940, and had made his way out of the city to take part in the fighting to delay the German advance until Allied help arrived. The lieutenant colonel had made his way to still neutral Sweden and then northwards by car and train until recrossing the border at Nybergsund on 13 April. After organizing the defences in the Trysil area, and initially being given the task of leading Danish and Swedish volunteer troops in action, Dannevig was ordered by Colonel Hans Sommerfeldt Hiorth to set up a prisoner-of-war camp for up to 200 German captives. He was at the same time made commandant of the Otta Valley. After Dannevig's first choice, the agricultural school in V√•g√•, became unavailable because the Norwegian Army High Command wanted to use it as a hospital, Loar School in the village of Fossbergom in Lom was chosen.M√∏lmen 1996: 324 Operation Using local volunteers and conscripts, Lieutenant Colonel Dannevig had the school fitted out as a prison camp and trenches dug in the vicinity. Barbed wire fences surrounded the school and fighting positions and shrapnel shelters were built from timber at the site of the camp.M√∏lmen 1996: 326 Dannevig also organized local militia units in the surrounding areas.M√∏lmen 1996: 324-325 Lom prisoner of war camp sorted under the Norwegian 2nd Division, led by General Jacob Hvinden Haug. The first German prisoners arrived at the camp on 20 April 1940. A few arrested members of the Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling (NS) came in together with the Germans. The prisoners were housed in the school's gym.M√∏lmen 1996: 325 Food was cooked and the camp population fed in the main school building. On 21 April Dannevig and the local police officer in Lom interrogated the imprisoned Nasjonal Samling members. After it had been determined that the NS men posed no security risk, they were released and allowed to join the local militia unit. As Luftwaffe air attack posed a constant risk drills were held in manning the trenches at the camp and in shooting at aircraft. On 22 April a minor air attack occurred, with the Norwegians firing at the bombers in an effort to force them to attack from higher altitudes. The next day, 23 April, a much heavier attack on Lom occurred. Several houses in the area were hit and one soldier and three civilians wounded. One bomb hit the prisoner-of-war camp, but failed to explode.M√∏lmen 1996: 325-326 Among the buildings damaged in the raid was the post office and a local business building. The target of the bombing raid was believed by the Norwegians to have been a nearby bridge.Midtdal 1995: 32 The second and last consignment of prisoners arrived at Lom on 25 April 1940. With the latest additions to the camp population it consisted of six officers, 100 soldiers, four female personnel, 35 German prisoners-of-war and five Norwegian prisoners. The German prisoners at Lom included infantrymen, artillerymen, Luftwaffe personnel and Fallschirmj√§ger soldiers.M√∏lmen 1996: 327 One of the first Germans to have been captured during the Norwegian Campaign had been taken prisoner at B√∏n, south of Eidsvoll on 11 April. In a short skirmish between Norwegian troops and a German patrol, two Gebirgsj√§ger had been killed and the Leutnant in command of the patrol captured. After initial confusion over what to do with the officer, he had been first placed in Sel Auxiliary Prison and later transferred to Lom.M√∏lmen 1996: 40, 42 Most of the prisoners had been captured in fighting east of Lake Mj√∏sa, including at Strandlykkja.Arneberg 1989: 119‚Äì120 During the 14-17 April battle of Strandlykkja a German bus had accidentally driven into the forward Norwegian positions on 16 April and had been shot up by Colt M/29 heavy machine guns. Nine German artillerymen were captured.Hauge 1995: 279-281 When the Norwegian forces retreated from the Morskogen/Strandlykkja region east of Mj√∏sa they brought with them 21 prisoners of war, all of whom were sent to the camp at Lom via the Riding House complex at Hamar and Sel Auxiliary Prison.M√∏lmen 1996: 53, 42 The Fallschirmj√§ger prisoners held at Lom had been captured after having been shot down by Norwegian ground fire en route to attacking the rail road junction of Domb√•s on 14 April 1940.M√∏lmen 1996: 196-197 Included amongst the prisoners were three officers; one Hauptmann and two Leutnants. Two other German prisoners held at Lom were the pilot Unteroffizier Helmut M√ºtschele and his navigator, Karl Lorey. The Messerschmitt Bf 110 flown by M√ºtschele had been shot down by the Gloster Gladiator fighter aircraft flown by Norwegian Army Air Service Sergeant Kristian Fredrik Schye during air battles near Oslo on 9 April 1940.Thomas 2002: 26 Among the Norwegian prisoners held at Lom was the commander of the Norwegian Army Air Service's air school at Kjeller, Rittmester Harald Normann. Normann was held after having been arrested on 16 April 1940 on suspicion of collaborating with the fascist coup led by Vidkun Quisling. The suspicion was founded in that he as the only Norwegian commander had brought his air unit away from its regular base and to a safer secondary base shortly before the German invasion.M√∏lmen 1996: 328 Normann's decision on 15 April to evacuate the aircraft under his command to neutral Sweden furthered the suspicions against him and led to his arrest. He was imprisoned for a total of 10 days on the orders of the Norwegian Army High Command, before he was released. After his release Normann assumed command of an infantry unit fighting the Germans in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag, before making his way through Sweden to Northern Norway and taking command of Banak Air Station in Finnmark. Both the Military Investigative Commission of 1946 and later investigations in 1975 cleared Normann of the charges relating to his actions in April 1940. Before arriving at Lom, Normann and several other Norwegian and German prisoners had been held and interrogated at Sel Auxiliary Prison. The prison was under the command of Major Peter Krohn, while the main interrogators were the chief of the Norwegian military police Eivind Rognlien and his second in command, police chief Jonas Lie. Rognlien and Lie both interrogated Rittmester Normann, Lie coming to the conclusion that Normann was innocent, but being overruled by Rognlien.R√∏dder 1990: 80‚Äì81 Dissolution On 26 April 1940 Lieutenant Colonel Dannevig was informed that the Germans were about to capture the town of Otta, cutting off the Otta Valley. The commander of the 2nd Division, General Jacob Hvinden Haug, authorized Dannevig to do as he saw best with the forces at his command.M√∏lmen 1996: 326-327 Dannevig decided to evacuate the camp and march his troops and prisoners over the mountains to join the Norwegian 4th Division in Sogn. All the prisoners were taken along, while about half of the Norwegian soldiers were dismissed because of insufficient skiing skills. The march westwards began at 1000hrs on 27 April, the German prisoners dragging ski sleds across the snow-clad mountains. The first night was spent at Krosbu. Many prisoners soon suffered from snow blindness and exhaustion, some having to be left behind at the hotel Turtagr√∏, where the column spent the second night, to be retrieved later by snow sleds. Over several days the prisoners were brought by boat to Vadheim in Sogn. By the time the prisoners reached Vadheim resistance in the southern parts of Norway was ending and the Germans were left to themselves. Dannevig's militia unit was disbanded on 1 May 1940. The commander of Lom prisoner of war camp, Lars Dannevig, joined the Norwegian resistance movement after the end of the Norwegian Campaign. After a failed attempt at escaping across the North Sea to the United Kingdom, Dannevig was arrested by the Gestapo in 1942 and killed during interrogation in Trondheim.M√∏lmen 1996: 328-329 NotesReferencesBibliography   * Category:Buildings and structures in Innlandet Category:Norwegian campaign Category:World War II prisoner of war camps in Norway Category:1940 establishments in Norway Category:History of Innlandet ","title":"Lom prisoner of war camp"},{"id":"29137448","text":"Fardd is a Welsh epithet (a mutated form of 'bardd', the Welsh word for 'poet') which is positioned after a personal name in a bardic nom-de-plume: * Bleddyn Fardd (c. 1258‚Äì1284), Welsh-language court poet * Myrddin Fardd (1836‚Äì1921), Welsh writer Category:Surnames of Welsh origin ","title":"Fardd"},{"id":"29137506","text":"Emmanuel N.

He was considered one of Ireland's most recognisable doctors ‚Äì \\"Ireland's answer to Dr Christian Barnard\\" ‚Äì and performed a number of firsts in Irish medicine. It is thought that he performed 14,000 ‚Äì 15,000 heart operations during his career. After his death in 2010, Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny described him as \\"the first superstar of Irish medicine\\". Professional career In 1974, Neligan performed Ireland's first open-heart surgery for congenital heart defects. In 1975, he performed Ireland's first coronary artery by-pass graft. In 1985, he carried out the first heart transplant in the country's history, and was given no assistance by the Department of Health in doing so. Neligan also co-founded the Blackrock Clinic. From 1971 until 2002, he was consultant cardiac surgeon at the Mater Hospital and, from 1974 until 2002, he served at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin. Family life Neligan was originally from Booterstown, County Dublin. He attended Blackrock College. He studied medicine at University College Dublin (UCD), from where he graduated successfully in 1962. He married Pat, a fellow doctor. They met in the accident and emergency unit of St Vincent's Hospital when Pat crashed her father's car on her graduation day ‚Äì \\"I hobbled off on my crutch, and he came after me and said, would you like to go out?\\", Pat later told Miriam O'Callaghan. The couple went on to have seven children. Three were sons and four were daughters. Daughter Sara was murdered in 2007. 12,000 letters were sent to the family by members of the public. After his retirement from surgery Neligan maintained a public profile and contributed a column to the weekly health supplement which comes with The Irish Times. He loved to read and appreciated poetry. He became an ardent critic of government health policy and campaigned for the retention of patient services when the government threatened to cut them. In his final year he was interviewed for a book, Insights into Leadership in Ireland: Insights from Contemporary Leaders in the Public, Private and Voluntary Sectors, launched by Martin McAleese in September 2010. After retiring Neligan was often seen in Glenbeigh, County Kerry. He died suddenly at home at the age of 73 on the morning of 8 October 2010. The day before he had met with former Blackrock College classmates for a 55th year reunion. The day after his death he had been expected to address GPs in Kilkenny. Fine Gael health spokesperson Dr. James Reilly said \\"medicine has lost a great pioneer and a leading thinker\\". In July 2012, the Mater Foundation, together with the Neligan family, established the Maurice Neligan Tribute Fund in recognition of his great achievements during the years he served with the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital. The Mater Foundation plans to raise ‚Ç¨700,000 from this Fund to purchase a core piece of equipment called a Zeego-CArm and thus enable the first Hybrid Theatre in a public hospital in Ireland, which will be named the Maurice Neligan Heart & Vascular Theatre.

Delgado, and starring Luis Aguilar, Lola Beltr√°n, Flor Silvestre, Emilio Fern√°ndez, Manuel Capetillo, Antonio Aguilar, and Irma Dorantes, as credited in the film's theatrical posters. The lead actors were credited in an unusual \\"rigorous appearance on the screen\\" style, where the film's main characters are not ordered by importance, but by on-screen appearance. Written for the screen by Alfredo Salazar, the film was a production of Cinematogr√°fica Calder√≥n and follows the account of a silver- plated revolver, which has a deadly curse and falls on the hands of different men. Plot The film opens in a cave with a close-up of Juan Ch√°vez's (Luis Aguilar) silver-plated revolver as he glances at a \\"Wanted\\" poster that offers a reward, dead or alive, for his capture. A suspicious man follows Juan out of the cave, and traces him into a small town. There, he enters a bar called \\"La Patrona\\", whose bartender is Carmen (Lola Beltr√°n) who is infatuated with Juan. She serves him something to drink, and they converse, as a next scene focuses on a beautiful woman named Rosa (Flor Silvestre) who sings the song \\"Cari√±o bonito\\" as she waters her geraniums and watches her birds. At the end of her singing, her aunt (Emma Rold√°n) arrives at the house and tells her of Juan's return to the town. She replies that he came back for her to take her with him, and to prepare her clothes. When Rosa arrives at the bar, Juan responds to her coldly, and even depreciates her.

Life and career = 1930‚Äì1943: Childhood  Flor Silvestre was born Guillermina Jim√©nez Chabolla on 16 August 1930 in Salamanca, Guanajuato, Mexico. She is the third child and second daughter of Jes√∫s Jim√©nez Cervantes, a butcher, and Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Chabolla Pe√±a (1906 - 5 September 1993). Her father owned and ran a meat shop in Salamanca. Her older siblings are Francisco \\"Pancho\\" and Raquel, and her younger siblings are Enriqueta \\"La Prieta Linda\\", Jos√© Luis, Mar√≠a de la Luz \\"Mary\\", and Arturo. Enriqueta and Mar√≠a de la Luz also became singers. Her maternal grandparents were Felipe Chabolla and In√©s Pe√±a. Guillermina was raised in Salamanca and began singing at an early age. Her parents, who were also fond of singing, encouraged her to sing. She loved the mariachi music of famous Mexican singers Jorge Negrete and Lucha Reyes, and also sang songs that belonged to the pasodoble, tango, and bolero genres, which were popular in Mexico in the late 1930s. Her interest in singing and acting led her to participate in Christmas pageants, school plays, and local festivals.Liner notes by Ra√∫l Vieyra for the album Flor Silvestre, vol. 6. Her mother, who wanted to live in Mexico City, urged her father to sell all their property in Salmanca and relocate the family to the Mexican capital. Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s took her three youngest children with her to Mexico City, leaving the oldest four (including Guillermina) in Salamanca in the care of her sisters, who were nuns. Guillermina completed primary school in Salamanca before reuniting with her family in Mexico City. In Mexico City, her parents enrolled her in the Escuela Bancaria Comercial Milton on Madero Avenue, where she took secretarial classes.  1943‚Äì1949: Early stage and radio success  Teatro del Pueblo, where Flor Silvestre made her debut Guillermina Jim√©nez (Flor Silvestre) began her singing career in 1943, when she was 13 years old. She and her father attended a performance of the famous Mariachi Pulido at the Teatro del Pueblo, a theater located in the Abelardo L. Rodr√≠guez Market in central Mexico City. After the performance was over, she got up on stage and told the stage director that she wanted to sing. The Mariachi Pulido's director refused to accompany her, stating that they did not collaborate with amateurs, but the stage director, Carlos L√≥pez Santill√°n, told her that he would let her sing the following week and promised to hire a mariachi from the Tenampa bar to perform with her. On the day of her debut, wearing a traditional Mexican blouse and skirt her mother had made for her, she sang three popular songs, \\"La canci√≥n mexicana\\", \\"Yo tambi√©n soy mexicana\\", and \\"El herradero\\". Her performance was a great success and she received an ovation from the audience. Her next performance at the Teatro del Pueblo was in the play La soldadera, directed by L√≥pez Santill√°n, in which she played a girl who comes out of a railway wagon and sings \\"La soldadera\\", a song written for her by Jos√© de Jes√∫s Morales. The play was also broadcast by Mexico's national radio station, XEFO, and \\"La soldadera\\" became the first song she performed on radio. The title of the song, which is Spanish for \\"the female soldier\\", also became her first stage name until it was claimed by another singer. Arturo Blancas, an Exc√©lsior journalist and XEFO announcer, thought she looked more \\"like a flower\\" than a soldier and suggested she change her stage name to La Amapola, which means \\"the poppy\\". However, this stage name was also claimed by another woman, the sister of singer La Panchita. Blancas then chose the title of Dolores del R√≠o's 1943 drama film as the young singer's new stage name, and Guillermina Jim√©nez became Flor Silvestre, which means \\"wild flower\\". Under her new stage name, Flor Silvestre won first place in an amateur contest sponsored by Mexico's most popular radio station, XEW, known as \\"the voice of Latin America from Mexico\\". Her participation in the contest earned her a contract to sing in revues at the Teatro Colonial, located on San Juan de Letr√°n Avenue (now Eje Central). The Teatro Colonial was \\"Mexico's most popular [theater]\\" in the 1940s, and Flor Silvestre's performances there were noticed by a showman who hired her as part of his touring company. The showman and his company toured Torre√≥n, in northern Mexico, where Flor Silvestre was the opening act of the touring company's headliner, the famous Argentine tango singer Hugo del Carril. Flor Silvestre's family was experiencing financial problems at the time, and she sang at banquets and other places in order to win more money and help her parents. In December 1945, Flor Silvestre performed at Guadalajara's Coliseo Ol√≠mpico and was announced as \\"Flor Silvestre, the Soul of Ranchera Song\\". In November 1946, she was invited to perform at the inauguration of Guadalajara's Ju√°rez movie theater. The Guadalajara newspaper El Informador described her as \\"Flor Silvestre, young XEW singer, who represents the feeling of our land within the ranchera song\\". Between 1947 and 1949, Flor Silvestre and the showman's company toured Central and South America, performing at the best nightclubs along the way. Hugo del Carril presented Flor Silvestre to audiences when the company toured Argentina.Liner notes by Ra√∫l Vieyra from the album Flor Silvestre, vol. 6 (1967). The company eventually made its way to Peru, where they performed for the Mexican Air Force, before returning to Mexico.  1950‚Äì1952: Acting debut and first records  Flor Silvestre on the cover of Cinema Reporter in February 1950 When Flor Silvestre returned to Mexico from her South American tour in 1950, her manager got her a contract to perform at Mexico City's most popular nightclub, El Patio. She later said: \\"Emilio Azc√°rraga and Gregorio Walerstein went there every day, and everyone saw me there, and they all hired me without me asking for anything, and everyone called me and called me, and that's how I started [singing] on the XEW [station]\\". Azc√°rraga, the owner of XEW, Mexico's top station, gave her her first radio program, Incre√≠ble pero cierto, which she also hosted. Walerstein, a leading film producer known as \\"the Tsar of Mexican films\\", signed her to a five-film contract. With the success of her radio program, her singing career began to ascend. Journalist M√≥nica Fio wrote in her column \\"Micr√≥fono\\": Flor Silvestre made her first records in 1950 for Columbia Records' Mexican branch. She recorded at least twelve songs for the label, one on each side of six 78 rpm singles. These songs also became her first hits. \\"Imposible olvidarte\\", \\"Que Dios te perdone\\", \\"Pobre coraz√≥n\\", \\"Viejo nopal\\", \\"Guadalajara\\", and \\"Mi amigo el viento\\" were recorded with Gilberto Parra's mariachi. \\"Siempre el amor\\", \\"Con un polvo y otro polvo\\", \\"Adoro a mi tierra\\", \\"La presentida\\", \\"Llorar amargo\\", and \\"Oye, morena\\" were recorded with Rub√©n Fuentes' mariachi. After recording her first singles, Flor Silvestre formed a duet named Las Flores with her then-unknown sister La Prieta Linda; they recorded two songs--\\"Los desvelados\\" and \\"Lo traigo en la sangre\\" (with Rub√©n Fuentes' mariachi)--for Columbia. In February 1950, she was a part of the \\"numerous, hybrid, but useful cast\\" of ¬°A los toros!, a revue about bullfighting staged at the Teatro T√≠voli. It was written and presented by announcer Paco Malgesto, who would become her second husband. In the revue, she sang Mexican musical numbers associated with bullfights. Although Flor Silvestre had made her film debut in 1949 singing in Te besar√© en la boca (released in 1950), she was given her first leading role in the Walerstein production Primero soy mexicano (1950), co-starring Joaqu√≠n Pardav√© (who also wrote and directed the film) and Luis Aguilar and featuring Francisco \\"Charro\\" Avitia. She was reunited with her Primero soy mexicano co-stars Luis Aguilar and Francisco Avitia in the film El tigre enmascarado, which premiered in 1951. She then appeared as the leading lady of actor Dagoberto Rodr√≠guez in a film trilogy, El lobo solitario, La justicia del lobo, and Vuelve el lobo (all released in 1952).  1955‚Äì1957: Return to films and television debut  Flor Silvestre dancing with comedian Tin Tan, her co-star in ¬°Paso a la juventud..! and Escuela de verano in 1955 In early 1955, Flor Silvestre sang on the XEW radio program Su programa Calmex, sponsored by Calmex Sardines. Other entertainers on the program included Miguel Aceves Mej√≠a, the Tr√≠o Tari√°curi, and the Hermanitas de Alba. In 1955, she also appeared in her first color film, La doncella de piedra, one of the first Mexican CinemaScope productions. An adaptation of R√≥mulo Gallegos' novel Sobre la misma tierra, the film features Flor Silvestre in the role of Cantaralia Barroso, the mother of the novel's protagonist, Remota Montiel (played by Elsa Aguirre). Flor Silvestre had one of the starring roles in the stage play La hacienda de Carrillo, a revue which opened on 1 July 1955 at the new Teatro Ideal. Written by Carlos M. Ortega and Pablo Prida, the play was about \\"a hacienda in the interior [of the country], whose owner leaves his land to embrace politics, become a deputy, and come to the metropolis in the company of his daughters\\". Theater critic Armando de Mar√≠a y Campos wrote that the cast included \\"the radio singer Guillermina Jim√©nez de Rubiales, better known as Flor Silvestre, very beautiful and young too, and also very tender as a vedette\\". That same month, Flor Silvestre, Agust√≠n Lara, Pedro Vargas, Rosa de Castilla, and others provided musical performances for the film La virtud desnuda (released in 1957), a Calder√≥n Films production starring Columba Dom√≠nguez. Her first film co-starring Antonio Aguilar, her future husband, was La huella del chacal. That same year she played a swarthy maid named Liliana in Rapto al sol, a color film shot in Nicaragua. In 1957, RCA Victor released her first recording of \\"Cielo rojo\\", which would become one of her signature songs. The single, which included \\"¬°Qu√© padre es la vida!\\" on side B, became a hit. On Mother's Day 1957, she made her television debut with a successful performance in the television play Secreto de familia, with Sara Garc√≠a and Miguel Arenas. One of her famous roles was as Leonor, the mother of Cantinflas' godson, in the popular Eastmancolor comedy El bolero de Raquel (1957).  1958‚Äì1963: First recordings for Musart Records and √Ånimas Trujano  She received top billing for the first time in Pueblo en armas (1959) and its sequel ¬°Viva la soldadera! (1960), both directed by Miguel Contreras Torres. She had a supporting role opposite Mar√≠a F√©lix in Ismael Rodr√≠guez's Mexican Revolution epic La cucaracha (1959). She also recorded \\"Te he de querer\\", \\"La chancla\\", and \\"La Valentina\\" for the film's soundtrack album, La cucaracha: M√∫sica de la pel√≠cula, released by Musart Records. Flor Silvestre, her first Musart album, was released around 1958. It includes her early Musart hits, such as \\"El ramalazo\\", \\"¬°Qu√© bonito amor!\\", \\"La flor de la canela\\", \\"√âchame a m√≠ la culpa\\", \\"Ay el amor\\", \\"L√°grimas del alma\\", and \\"Am√©monos\\". In 1960, she starred opposite the popular comedy duo Viruta and Capulina in Dos locos en escena. In 1961, she rerecorded \\"Cielo rojo\\" for Musart, accompanied by Pepe Villa's Mariachi M√©xico. This second version also became a success and is the first track of her second Musart album, Flor Silvestre con el Mariachi M√©xico. The album also includes her early 1960s hits, \\"Pa' todo el a√±o\\", \\"Renunciaci√≥n\\", \\"Desolaci√≥n\\", \\"El peor de los caminos\\", \\"Aquel inmenso amor\\", and \\"Para morir iguales\\". One of her major roles was as Catalina, the beautiful, sensuous flirt, in the Oscar-nominated, Golden Globe-winning drama film √Ånimas Trujano (1962), co-starring Toshiro Mifune and Columba Dom√≠nguez. This was her second collaboration with film director Ismael Rodr√≠guez after her supporting role in La cucaracha.  1964‚Äì1969: Multiple albums  Flor Silvestre and Antonio Aguilar in the film Juan Colorado (1966).

Her fourth Musart album, La sentimental (1964), includes both ranchera and bolero songs. It is her first album without mariachi arrangements; Benjam√≠n \\"Cham√≠n\\" Correa is credited as the album's guitarist. La sentimental peaked at number 9 on Record World Latin American LP Hit Parade. \\"Mi destino fue quererte\\" peaked at number 4 on Record World Latin American Single Hit Parade and became one of Flor Silvestre's signature songs. In December 1964, Cashbox ranked her among the top ten Mexican folk singers of the year. Her fifth Musart album, La acariciante voz de Flor Silvestre, was released in 1965. One of the album's singles, \\"Una limosna\\", topped the Record World Latin American Single Hit Parade chart.

She was destroyed in a fire on the river near modern Pennington, Alabama on March 1, 1858. It was the greatest maritime disaster in Tombigbee River history, with an estimated thirty-three people killed, out of roughly sixty passengers and a crew of forty-five. The disaster and its aftermath saw the Eliza Battle enter southwestern Alabama folklore as a ghost ship, with numerous purported sightings of the burning ship from just north of Pennington to Nanafalia downriver. The story of the disaster and associated folklore has been fictionalized in several published short stories, most notably in ‚ÄúThe Phantom Steamboat of the Tombigbee‚Äù in 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey. Background The Eliza Battle was launched in New Albany, Indiana in 1852. A side-wheeled paddle steamer, the wooden-hulled ship had a size of 316 tons. She was operated out of Mobile, Alabama by the firm of Cox, Brainard and Company. One of the most luxurious riverboats plying the state's waters at that time, former President Millard Fillmore was entertained during a reception on board the ship in Mobile on April 7, 1854. Disaster Moscow Landing, near the site of the disaster. Captained by S. Graham Stone and with Daniel Epps as pilot, the Eliza Battle departed Columbus in the last days of February 1858. Only able to negotiate the Tombigbee that far north during the regular flooding of the river during the winter months, the ship made its way downriver with stops at Pickensville, Gainesville, Demopolis and numerous small river landings. By the time that the ship left Demopolis, on February 28, 1858, she was fully loaded with passengers and more than 1200 bales of cotton. During an already cold night, a strong north wind began to blow, with the air temperature decreasing another 40 ¬∞F in the two hours after nightfall. At roughly 2 a.m. on March 1, 1858, about downriver from Demopolis, near Beckley‚Äôs Landing (), it was discovered that cotton bales on the main deck were on fire. Partially attributed to the strong winds, the fire soon spread out of control. The boat continued downstream out of control. Cut off from the lifeboat by the flames, the passengers, dressed only in their nightclothes, were forced to seek refuge in the icy river. Some survived by floating atop cotton bales. The Eliza Battle finally came to rest above Kemp's Landing (), near the modern Alabama State Route 114 bridge over the river near Pennington. The survivors were rescued by the Magnolia and local residents, with some passengers having to be retrieved from treetops along the flooded river. All of the casualties were attributed to drowning or exposure to the extreme cold during the night. The ship sank below the waters of the Tombigbee following the disaster, with the hull of the wreck remaining on the river bottom in of water to the present day. Folklore In Kathryn Tucker Windham's 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey the disaster and folklore concerning the ghost ship is recorded as ‚ÄúThe Phantom Steamboat of the Tombigbee‚Äù. The story roughly follows newspaper accounts of the disaster. It is purported in the story that sightings of the ship tend to happen on cold and windy winter nights, with the ship, fully engulfed in flames, appearing on the river near the same locations where the disaster occurred.

It is sympatric with the larger M. americana over much of its range (the latter tends to have significantly higher population densities), and reportedly also with M. gouazoubira in a few areas. It was considered a subspecies of M. gouazoubira, with which it is parapatric, until 2000.

It is widely considered to be the most prestigious public interest scholarship for law students in the country. The program The Root-Tilden-Kern Program looks for students with a demonstrated commitment to the public interest, exceptional leadership ability, and a history of academic achievement. In assessing these criteria, the program looks at the whole person and considers previous life experience and professional work. The program values diversity and strives to select a class that is diverse in terms of race, sex, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, geographic origins, and ideology. Interested candidates should submit an application with their application to New York University School of Law. The application is reviewed by a student and faculty committee before recommendation for an interview. Each year, approximately 50 applicants are invited to interview with a panel composed of a faculty member, a judge, a practitioner and third-year scholars. Twenty scholars are selected for each incoming class. Scholars are expected to work in public service for a minimum of five years after graduation or the completion of judicial clerkships. History In the 1950s, Dean Emeritus Arthur Vanderbilt conceived of the Root-Tilden Scholarship to transform NYU from a local law school to a nationally and internationally esteemed institution. Founded in 1951, the purpose of the program was to ‚Äútrain promising young men so as to help attain again for the American bar the high position which it once held as the reservoir of altruistic and competent public leadership.‚Äù The program was named for two alumni, Elihu Root and Samuel Tilden, who exemplified Vanderbilt's ideal ‚Äì lawyers dedicated to public leadership. Twenty scholars were selected for the first class from each of the country's then ten judicial circuits. Scholars were at first required to take special courses in the humanities, social sciences, history and natural sciences and required to live together and share mealtimes five days a week. Scholars met with leaders in government, industry and finance. In 1969, after a campaign by student groups, the first women were admitted to the Root Program. To date, more than 800 Root-Tilden Scholars have graduated from NYU School of Law. In 1998, then Dean John Sexton announced a precedent-setting gift of $5 million from an alumnus of the Root-Tilden Scholarship, Jerome H. Kern (class of 1960), that began a major capital campaign to raise $30 million for the program. To honor Kern's generous contribution, the Law School renamed the program as the Root-Tilden- Kern Scholarship Program. Kern is the chairman of Symphony Media Systems, LLC, and was formerly a senior partner of the law firm Baker & Botts. In 2004, under the leadership of Dean Richard Revesz, the Law School successfully completed its campaign goal of $30 million and now offers full-tuition scholarships to 20 students each year.

The six contiguous properties included within the district are defined on the National Register of Historic Places and consist of four Colonial structures, one Federal/Greek Revival, and one undefined style structure. The corner property of Liberty Street and East Main Street is an established bed and breakfast. The district is located within the larger, National Register of Historic Places-listed Clinton Village Historic District. History A vestige of 17th-century common land, Liberty Green is a park-like triangle between Liberty Street and East Main Street, encompassing the village green. and The common town land was part of a larger open space for militia war drills, and was also the site of one of Clinton's earliest schoolhouses. The Liberty Green Historic District was chosen as the site for the town's Civil War monument (a granite soldier atop a tall pedestal), and a small cannon from the War of 1812. Beginning in 1846, a group of citizens banded together to plant shade trees and Liberty Green came to assume its present park-like appearance and function. In addition to providing a peaceful public open space, it served a symbolic function, recalling the town's patriotic past and providing the site for memorials to the town's soldiers.

The schoolchildren indicated that the capsule should be opened on 4 July 2976.Inscription plaque on marker stone. In 2009, the Clinton Town Tree Warden ordered a public tree removal in order to clear half-dozen overgrown trees and prune many large and dangerous branches from the Liberty Green trees. The tree removal provides additional open space and sunlight. In 2010, the Liberty Green retail complex, located across the street from the historic district, was set to be completed with the construction of a two- story building affording of retail space and three second-story apartments. This building joins a hardware store, Japanese restaurant, and community health center in the same complex.

In 2004 the group supported a national tour by Shannon Noll. Their debut single, \\"The Morning After\\", was released on WEA Records and reached No. 22 on the ARIA Singles Chart in July 2004. Their debut album, Making Sense of Madness, recorded with Charles Fisher, was released on 6 June 2005. In mid-2005 they supported United States pop group, Hanson, on the Australian leg of their Live and Electric Tour. By 2007 the trio had disbanded. History Mark Patrick O'Shea (born ca. 1978, Dalby, Queensland) was a solo singer- songwriter and guitarist in Sydney when he worked with fellow singer- songwriter and keyboardist, Adam Matthew Ray (originally from Frankston, Victoria), and the pair started to write and perform together. In 2002 John Barry O'Shea moved from Dalby to join his brother on co-lead vocals, keyboards and guitar and the trio formed a rock pop group, Zinc. In 1996 Mark had released a solo country rock album, None of the Above. From early 2003 Zinc based themselves in Los Angeles for 18 months and worked with Mark Hudson, an American producer, and provided backing vocals for an album by Ringo Starr and one by Steven Tyler. Their debut single, \\"The Morning After\\", was released on WEA Records and reached No. 22 on the ARIA Singles Chart in July 2004. Mark described the track, \\"[its] about mistakes, regret and inevitability. I woke up one day and remembered all the stupid things that I had said and done the night before. I was in the midst of mouthing the words, 'I will never drink again' when a tiny voice, buried deep, deep, down, behind the jack-hammer in my head, called me a liar. I knew that I would end up drinking again and most probably make very similar, if not in fact the same, mistakes again\\". It was followed by \\"Help Me Help Myself\\" which reached the top 100 in December. In May 2005 Zinc released their debut album, Making Sense of Madness, which was recorded with Charles Fisher producing. According to Ray, \\"I think we actually surprise people when we sing ... Generally ‚Äì even with harmony bands ‚Äì there is (one) lead singer, But with our band it literally is John one song, Mark the next and me the next; there‚Äôs three lead singers. And all three really hold their own\\". Together with the album they issued their third single, \\"Inside\\", which peaked into the top 100 in June. In June and July they supported US pop group, Hanson, on the Australian leg of their Live and Electric Tour. Steve Jones of dBMagazine observed their performance, and described it as \\"a loose, but nonetheless well-received set.

Early life and education Friedrich Wilhelm was born at Kamenz Palace in Kamenz, Kingdom of Prussia, (now Kamieniec ZƒÖbkowicki, Poland) youngest child of Prince Albert of Prussia (1837‚Äì1906), (son of Prince Albert of Prussia and Princess Marianne of the Netherlands) and his wife, Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg (1854‚Äì1898), (daughter of Ernst I, Duke of Saxe- Altenburg and Princess Agnes of Anhalt-Dessau). He was great-grandson of King Frederick William III of Prussia and King William I of the Netherlands. He was second cousin of Wilhelm II, German Emperor. During his youth, he spent time in Berlin, also at his grandmother's Reinhartshausen Castle in Erbach and in Brunswick, where his father served as regent. A few years later he studied law at the University of Bonn, where he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. His main interests were in literature and music.Mark Gaworski, Palace in Kamieniec ZƒÖbkowickim. Architecture and owners, 2009, p. 106 Political career After marriage, the Prince lived with his wife in Rudy. In 1912, was elected Landrat of Frankenstein District, where it remained until 1918, until the abolition of the German monarchy and the establishment of the Weimar Republic. Previously, he participated actively in hostilities during the First World War, for which he was promoted to the rank of major general. Much of the time he traveled through Europe and the world, sometimes in important diplomatic missions, representing Emperor Wilhelm II. Sensing the fall of the monarchy in Germany, at the end of the war, he took up for discussion and exchange views with university professors on the reconstruction of the existing system of government, proposing the introduction of a constitutional monarchy modeled on the form of government of the United Kingdom. In 1918, he was considered for the office of the King of Finland. However, his wife's Catholicism prevented this, and the Finns chose Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse (who was Lutheran as was his wife) instead. After the war and the establishment of the republic in Germany, Friedrich Wilhelm became involved with the monarchists, proposing the restoration of the German Empire. He was determined to take over the role of regent until the heir to the throne reached the age of majority. He died in 1925, aged 44 in Weisser Hirsch, a residential district in Dresden. Marriage and issue Friedrich Wilhelm married 8 June 1910 at Potsdam to Princess Agatha of Hohenlohe- Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst (1888‚Äì1960), daughter of Victor II, Duke of Ratibor, and his wife, Countess Maria Breunner-Enkevoirth. They had four daughters: *Princess Marie Therese of Prussia (2 May 1911‚Äì 3 January 2005), married in 1932 to Aloys Rudolph Hug, had issue. *Princess Luise Henriette of Prussia (21 July 1912 ‚Äì 12 October 1973), married in 1936 to Wilhelm Schmalz, had issue. *Princess Marianne of Prussia (23 August 1913 ‚Äì 1 March 1983), married in 1933 to Prince Wilhelm of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld, had issue. *Princess Elisabeth of Prussia (9 February 1919 ‚Äì 24 August 1961), married in 1948 to Heinz Mees, no issue.

Vincenzo Maculani (11 September 1578 - 16 February 1667) was an Italian Catholic Cardinal, inquisitor and military architect. He was known as a severe man, harsh and without compassion, who preferred the black cappa of his order to the brighter purple he was later entitled to wear as a cardinal.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) Early life Maculani was born Gaspare Maculani on 11 September 1578 at Fiorenzuola d'Arda. He trained as a bricklayer (his father's profession) before entering the Order of Preachers in Pavia in 1594 and changing his name to Vincenzo. He studied in Bologna, becoming a lector of theology and canon law but also of practical geometry and architecture. He was appointed as an Inquisitor in Padua in 1627 and in Genoa from 1627 to 1629. While he was in Genoa he was also given the task of rebuilding the city's wall, along with Giovanni Battista Baliani. Parts of Genoa's new walls remain standing today. The Inquisition Thereafter, Maculani was called to Rome by Pope Urban VIII, who named him procurator-general of his order during a visit to France.A. Touron, Histoire des homes illustres de l' Ordre de S. Dominique (Paris 1749), 450. He became an inquisitor (the official title being Commissary General) under Urban's Cardinal-Nephew; Grand Inquisitor of the Roman Inquisition, Francesco Barberini. After Galileo Galilei's falling-out with Pope Urban VIII, Maculani conducted the first interview with the scientistStephen C. Spiteri (2016).

(on 12 April 1633); the inquiry was conducted in Fra Vincenzo's chambers at the Palace of the Inquisition in Rome.Karl von Gebler, Galileo and the Roman Curia (London 1879), 201 This was the first stage in Galileo's trial and persecution by the Inquisition. Maculani personally delivered the report of the First Examination to Pope Urban VIII and the Cardinals on 27 April 1633Gebler, 213. Maculani also presided at the Third Examination on 10 May 1633.Domenico Berti, Il processo originale di Galileo (Roma 1876), 82. Urban VIII ordered a Fourth Examination, to inquire into Galileo's 'intent' in publishing his Dialogue, and specifically authorized Maculani to threaten to use torture.Berti, 118-119. However, while Maculani was generally cold and uncaring, it was he who determined that Galileo was too old and too ill to undergo torture.Retrying Galileo, 1633-1992 by Maurice A. Finocchiaro (University of California Press, 2007) Architecture in Rome The Porta Portese; commissioned by Pope Urban VIII and constructed by Maculani. Once in the service of Pope Urban, Maculani was tasked with overseeing the Pope's vast military-centric building program. First, Maculani added fortifications (including moats and ramparts) to the Castel Sant'Angelo. He then constructed defences around the gardens of the Cortile del Belvedere and the Porta Cavalleggeri (and its nearby church). History of the popes; their church and state (Volume III) by Leopold von Ranke (2009, Wellesley College Library) Maculani also constructed walls at Lungara (within the Trastevere) and the Janiculum and extended them to the priory on the Aventine Hill. The walls included the Porta Portese which was finally completed in 1644. In 1639, Pope Urban VIII promoted Fra Vincenzo to the post of Maestro dei Sacri Palazzi.J. Catalano, De magistro sacri palatii apostolici (Romae 1751, 158-163. This position gave him the responsibility of reviewing every book presented for publication in Rome, and the power of granting, or not granting, the imprimatur. Wars of Castro During the Wars of Castro, Pope Urban again put Maculani's architectural skills to good use - he was sent ahead of papal forces (led by Antonio Barberini and Luigi Mattei) to oversee the fortification of various towns, palaces and castles under threat from the forces of the Dukes of Parma. Contemporary John Bargrave suggested his work put him in good stead with the Pope and his family, the Barberini, but made him incredibly unpopular with the people and with local nobles. This included the Mattei (rather ironic, given one of their sons was leading papal forces) who lost half a villa to the construction of fortifications. Cardinalate Maculani was elevated to the Cardinalate on 16 December 1641Catholic Hierarchy: Vincenzo (Gaspare) Cardinal Maculani and was appointed Cardinal- Priest of the Basilica di San Clemente in 1642. He was elected Archbishop of Benevento in that year and was consecrated in the Sistine Chapel by Cardinal Antonio Marcello Barberini, brother of Pope Urban VIII. In 1643 he was recalled to Rome to serve the Pope and resigned his archdiocese but Urban VIII died in 1644. Maculani participated in the papal conclave of 1644 which elected Pope Innocent X. Conclave of 1644. In the middle of the Conclave, after the first candidate proposed by the Barberini faction, Cardinal Giulio Cesare Sacchetti, had failed to win enough support, Maculani was offered as a candidate. But he had enemies, including Fra Michele Mazarin, OP, the brother of Cardinal Mazarin. He did not, therefore, have the support of the French faction. Again recognising his architectural skills, the new Pope sent him to Malta to oversee construction of the new fortifications for the island, in particular the Lascaris towers. Upon his return he continued work on the Castel Sant'Angelo and the walls started during Urban's reign.S.

By the late 1960s she prepared some volume of documents, descriptions, and so on (about 3000 typed pages) on the history of the Russian folk puppet theatre. In 1993 a small part of this work was printed in the book Puppets come in the stage. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Inna Solomonik turned to studies of oriental puppet performances. In 1980 she was ready with her PhD thesis. The kernel of this research was a semiotic analysis of the silhouettes of Wayang Purwa figures. Later Inna Solomonik continued to study the Asian puppet theatre, and published two monographs on the subject (1983, 1992). In 2001 she published the book-album on Javanese Wayang Beber.

Biography Druzhinin was born into a wealthy family in the district of Golov, part of Saint Petersburg Governorate. He was educated at home until the age of sixteen, and then sent to military school. Upon graduation in 1843, he joined the Life-Guards Finland Regiment of the Russian Imperial Guard, where he was chosen as regimental librarian. In 1846 he retired from the military and took up a civil service post. He left the civil service after five years in order to devote himself entirely to literary pursuits. From 1848 to 1855 he was the literary editor of the important journal Sovremennik (The Contemporary). During this time he published a large number of short novels, stories, and feuilletons, translated various works of English literature into Russian and wrote a biography of the painter Pavel Fedotov. In 1847 he published his most popular work, the epistolary novella Polinka Saks. He followed this up with The Story of Aleksei Dmitrich in 1848. Both were published in Sovremennik, and received praise from the prominent critic Vissarion Belinsky. After the death of Belinsky in 1848, Druzhinin and Pavel Annenkov became Russia's most prominent critics. After he left Sovremennik, he edited the journal The Library for Reading, where he espoused a conservative view of literature, denying that it should be subordinated to social and political aims, which was the approach advocated by Chernyshevsky and Dobrolyubov, the ideological voices of Sovremennik. Druzhinin became one of the chief proponents of the aesthetic movement in Russian literature, along with Pavel Annenkov and Vasily Botkin. Druzhinin was also the major initiator of the Literary Fund, an organization whose purpose was to give financial assistance to needy writers. Fyodor Dostoyevsky served as secretary to the fund between 1863 and 1865. Dostoyevsky also participated with Druzhinin in fundraising for the organization. Druzhinin was on friendly terms with many of his more famous contemporaries, including Leo Tolstoy, Alexander Ostrovsky, and Ivan Turgenev, whom he exchanged letters with. He died of tuberculosis in 1864, and was buried in Volkovo Cemetery in Saint Petersburg. English literature Druzhinin worked hard to acquaint Russian readers with English literature. He translated three of Shakespeare's plays; King Lear, Coriolanus and Richard III; he published a series of essays entitled Boswell and Johnson, about English life in the eighteenth century; and he wrote a life of George Crabbe which included numerous extracts from his poetry.

Its political base is in the south of the country, but the party is headquartered in the capital Bishkek. The party is led by Kamchybek Tashiyev, and has previously supported the ousted former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. 2010 parliamentary elections In the Kyrgyzstani parliamentary election, 2010, the party said it would seek to restore Bakiyev to power, and claimed it was more popular than the interim government. The party also suggested it would roll back the 2010 referendum and restore the presidency to its former state. On 7 October, the party's headquarters in Bishkek were ransacked and party literature set on fire by a groups of demonstrators who called for the party to be banned. The demonstrators allegedly included family members of the victims of April 2010 violence in Bishkek. In the election, the party won a number of seats from its traditional southern bastion, though it barely passed the threshold in the capital and the Chuy region. The party received the votes of 8.89% of eligible voters, giving it 28 of 120 seats in parliament. This result made the party the first of five parties to surpass the support threshold of 5% of eligible voters necessary to enter parliament.

Oggar was a villain of Captain Marvel chronology in Pre-Crisis; he made no Post-Crisis appearances. He first appeared in Captain Marvel Adventures # 61 (May 1946, Fawcett Comics). His first appearance in DC Comics was in World's Finest Comics # 264 (August 1980). He was a major recurring enemy of the Marvels in the DC Comics stories published before the continuity- resetting Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries in 1985. Fictional character biography Originally, the Wizard Shazam was called Shazamo. He was a powerful wizard and led a pantheon of heroes whose initials formed its name: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, Mercury ... and Oggar. However, power corrupted Oggar, who was a former pupil of Shazamo. At one point, Oggar refused an order from Shazamo to help a small nation that was being invaded by a tyrant. Oggar stated that Shazamo was getting old and that Oggar himself should lead the pantheon. After engaging in combat with Shazamo, he could not counter the wizard's power. Shazamo consequently condemned Oggar to live among mortals and subsequently removed the \\"O\\" from his name. Before leaving, Oggar remained close enough to the gates of the Shazamo temple that he heard a prophecy: In the twentieth century, the wizard (now Shazam) would die and would have a successor named Billy Batson. Billy was destined to become Captain Marvel and acquire the combined powers of the remaining heroes of the pantheon. Oggar thought it would be wise to wait until the twentieth century when there would only be Captain Marvel rather than seven enemies to defeat. However, 3000 years ago in the mortal world, Oggar tried to seduce the beautiful Circe to be his queen while attempting to conquer the world, but she refused (Note: This is Earth-S Circe; yet she resembles the mythological figure but is not the same Circe from the actual DC Universe). Oggar tried to avenge himself, but his magic was unable to harm women. So instead he gave her a gift by making her immortal. However, the spell did nothing to mitigate the effects of aging and after about 200 years she was still alive but terribly ugly and wrinkled. She eventually developed a mortal hatred of all men who were now horrified by her face. She learned witchcraft and how to turn men into animals. After his rebellion, the wizard Shazam cursed Oggar with cloven hooves. Oggar returned in the 20th Century and battled Captain Marvel as he tried to recruit people to the Cult of the Curse. If they left, they were driven mad. However, he finally encountered Circe, who turned him into a boar. In this form, he fell off of a precipice and died. However, he was able to reform himself with his magic due to the help of Mr. Mind and joined the Monster Society of Evil. He and Black Adam went to conquer Egypt. With his magic he turned Billy mute, then summoned up an army from the sand for Black Adam to lead. However Mary Marvel was able to trick him into striking Billy with lightning, after which the two Marvels defeat the army. Oggar and the rest of the Society attack the Rock of Eternity, forcing the entire Marvel Family to fight them. Mary disguises herself as her brother and gets close enough to Oggar to bind and gag him. Powers and abilities Oggar has divine strength and durability equal to Captain Marvel's. He possesses magic that enables him to do nearly anything, like turning Captain Marvel back with lightning or muting people, although each spell could only be used once against the same person. Oggar's power cannot be used to directly harm a female target, which makes Mary Marvel the preferred member of the Marvel Family to deal with him (however, Oggar has repeatedly worked around this limitation; one time by giving immortality to Circe without giving her an eternally youthful appearance, and another time by directing the magical lightning against the ground beneath Mary Marvel). Oggar can also fly, is immortal, and cannot age. However, he is vulnerable to magical transformation spells.

It aired on November 8, 2010. It is also the first episode to feature Amber Tamblyn as Martha Masters, as a replacement of Thirteen (Olivia Wilde). Plot A New Jersey senator Hal Andersons campaign manager Joe Dugan (played by Jack Coleman) falls ill with liver failure and temporary paralysis. Meanwhile, Cuddy pressures House to add a female doctor to his team but eventually tells him that she has chosen for him: a third-year med student named Martha Masters, who is a genius. Taub appears to have a problem with Masters, which Foreman and Chase try to figure out. Throughout the episode, House keeps firing and rehiring Masters, rehiring her whenever he needs her for an idea, and firing her again as soon as he's done talking to her. Masters suggests a neuroendocrine tumor, and the team also considers DIC. The team give Joe an MRI to look for a tumor, but don't find one. Taub runs Joe's blood, which also comes back normal. Looking at the senator on TV delivering a speech, House suspects the senator has Hepatitis C, and thinks that he's had sex with Joe, and thinks Joe has Hepatitis C as well. He gives Joe interferon, but Joe doesn't get better. Masters notes that a German research study has shown that 15% of people with Hepatitis C who have been injected with Hepatitis A got better. When Cuddy says trying this exposes the hospital to liability, Masters tells her that she's being a coward. Foreman and Chase eventually find out that Taub dislikes her because he interviewed her for Hopkins Med School for an hour and she didn't remember him, even though she remembered the 20th decimal place of Euler's number. At the end of the episode, Taub learns the truth about Masters. She did remember him but felt awkward reminding him, and he mumbles \\"Is this Grandma's tea cosy?\\" A reference to an earlier conversation Masters had with House. House takes the senator's blood and runs it under Joe's name to get Cuddy to approve on his decision, despite Wilson's warnings that lying to her would be wrong now that they are involved. House also hires Masters in the end, saying she had him when she called Cuddy a coward. The show ends with Cuddy going to the nurses station to check up on House and discovering his lie. She is very visibly upset. Reception=Critical response  Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club graded \\"Office Politics\\" a B+. He praised Amber Tamblyn's portrayal of the new Masters character. Handlen writes, \\"A lot of the credit here goes to Tamblyn, who plays Martha as a collection of tics and insecurities but with a strong, immutable center. This is a character type that appears regularly on other shows (and I'm sure we've seen variations on House before in patient form), but this is the first time we have a major female role who isn't a sexy lady who uses her sexiness to sex up the place. Sex. Tamblyn is adorable in her way, but she's also young, vulnerable, and distinctive, and there's something vital in her confrontations with House.\\" Ratings This episode was watched by 9.63 million U.S. viewers. 2.37 million Canadians watched this episode, ranking seventh for the week.

They formed in the early 1990s and have released seven studio albums and a number of singles. The band first came to prominence in 1992 when they recorded Dinamo ja volim, a rock song which instantly became an unofficial anthem of GNK Dinamo Zagreb football club supporters Bad Blue Boys. On December 6th, 2014, they sold out sporting hall Dom Sportova in Zagreb and played one of the biggest concert of their career.http://www.perun.hr/pips-chips-videoclips  Formation and Shimpoo Pimpoo (1992-1995)  In 1992, Dubravko Ivani≈° and Alen Kraljiƒá met and formed the band. Ivani≈° and Kraljiƒá then recruited Mario Bor≈°ƒçak (bass) and Igor Paradi≈° (drums) in Grill Zapruƒëe, a diner located in Zapruƒëe neighbourhood in Zagreb. The name of the band is a word play on the name of the movie Sex, Lies and Videotape. Their first major hit, \\"Dinamo ja volim\\" was originally intended to be a disco tune, but Kraljiƒá insisted on doing something more heavier, considering Bad Blue Boys were mostly listening to punk music. The song was inspired from The Adicts' version of You'll Never Walk Alone. The song starts off with Ivani≈° singing the poem Popevke sam slagal, originally written by Dragutin Domjaniƒá. The song became an instant hit and is now considered to be the unofficial anthem of GNK Dinamo Zagreb. At the time, the club was called HA≈†K Graƒëanski, much to the dismay of the fans. In December 1993, the band released their first studio album, Shimpoo Pimpoo, which included one of their first songs, \\"Krumpira\\" (\\"Potatoes\\"). Some of the band's other early songs, like \\"Gume na kotaƒçima\\" and \\"Prvi joint u ustima\\", became a staple in band's further live performances. In 1994, the band was supporting Mi≈°o Kovaƒç for a charity concert held in Stadion Poljud. During 1994, songs from Shimpoo Pimpoo were included in Borivoj Radakoviƒá's play Dobro do≈°li u plavi pakao (\\"Welcome to the blue hell\\") and in the following year, the band composed soundtrack for the play Mafija!.  Dernjava (1995-1997)  Sometime before recording their second studio album, guitarist Igor Ratkoviƒá and guitarist Davor Viduka joined the band. In December 1995, the bank released their second studio album, Dernjava. The album was a commercial success. Praised for the lyrics and guitar work, the album received the Porin for the best alternative rock album of 1996. Songs like \\"Po≈°tar lakog sna\\" and \\"Malena\\" have become fan favourites. In 1996, the band shot a music video for \\"Po≈°tar lakog sna\\". Many rock celebrities, such as Kojoti, Goran Bare, and Davor Gobac of Psihomodo Pop appeared in the video. The video was shot in Crna Kuƒáa, a mansion located in Zagreb. The band signed a contract with Duyvis and became their promoter in Croatia. From 1996 to 1999, Duyvis advertisements can be seen in many of band's music videos (\\"Nogomet\\", \\"Po≈°tar lakog sna\\", \\"Plaƒçi\\").

It aired on November 15, 2010. Plot In the 18th century, the Sotos Oosterzoon, a Dutch slave ship, travels to Bermuda. There is an outbreak of smallpox among the African captives and, fearing quarantine, they throw the slaves overboard but it is too late: the ship is fired upon and intentionally sunk, along with its crew and captives, in order to contain the disease. In modern day, a family on vacation dive into the wreckage of the slave ship. A teen girl brings a sealed glass jar back up from the wreck. She accidentally breaks the jar, cutting herself and exposing herself to the contents of the jar: scabs from the diseased captives. House is certain that the disease is smallpox, coming immediately to the same diagnosis as the crew. The family is quarantined, the girl and father, being especially compromised, are put in an isolation room, and the team administers the smallpox vaccine to the two. As soon as the tell-tale blisters begin to appear, the CDC is called per protocol and institutes a lockdown. As the lockdown is occurring, the team discovers a rash on the girl's armpits inconsistent with smallpox, causing House to change his diagnosis. Dr. Dave Broda, the CDC official overseeing the case, blocks House's team from contact with the patients to make a new diagnosis, so they turn to the only other evidence they have: the captain's logs from the wrecked slave vessel. House enlists the aid of a translator, a Dutch webcam stripper he finds on the internet. Based on the information in the logs, House is reconfirmed in his opinion that the girl does not have smallpox. House attempts to lie to get his team into the room to test his hypothesis, but is stopped. Masters, although unable to closely examine the patient, notices that the girl lacks the characteristic pustules that would be expected from smallpox. Meanwhile the girl's father begins to develop smallpox symptoms as well, but more characteristic symptoms. House is confounded as to why it appears that the girl does not have smallpox after all, but her father does. He concludes that the father contracted the disease from the smallpox vaccine they gave him. Unbeknownst to them, the father's immune system has been compromised by the return of his kidney cancer (which had been in remission). House demands they administer the treatment for the smallpox variola. When Broda refuses, House risks his own life by entering the containment room and administers the treatment to save the patient. However, the father does not respond to the medication and dies. House figures now that the disease was likely smallpox after all, and also realizes that he has consequently exposed himself. The rest of the team is despondent, but Masters returns to the journal in desperate search for another diagnosis. She notes that a cat on the ship had lost all his fur and then died, strong evidence for rickettsialpox, a disease easily treatable with antibiotics. Masters tasks House with searching the father's body for eschars. When House successfully spots eschars on the body, Broda orders that the daughter be treated with doxycycline, saving her life. In a subplot, Wilson and Sam reexamine their relationship while treating a young chemotherapy patient whose mother gets locked outside of the hospital during the lockdown. House and Cuddy also face relationship difficulties after Cuddy discovers House lied to her in \\"Office Politics\\" in order to administer an unconventional treatment of Hepatitis C (an injection of Hepatitis A) to a patient.

It aired on November 22, 2010. Plot A patient is admitted to Princeton Plainsboro after reenacting the Crucifixion. During the initial conversation, the patient reveals that he crucified himself to honor a bargain he made with God for curing his daughter's cancer. Taub comes up with a sound diagnosis but the patient starts losing teeth so the team scraps the idea. However, Chase and Masters break into the patient's apartment to see that he has been starving himself which was the likely cause of the tooth loss. Regardless, the patient refuses the treatment because of the promise he made to God to save his daughter. Meanwhile, Cuddy walls House for an apology about lying to her and also pulls him for the wedding dinner of the hospital's chairman-of-board. Chase takes Foreman to the wedding as a wingman and fixes him up with a girl, telling her that Foreman's his boss. At the end of the night, Chase takes off with that very girl and a friend of hers. While House and Cuddy start leaving for the rehearsal dinner, Cuddy makes a cynical remark by telling him that the marrying couple has only nineteen months because, in the state of New Jersey, couples can only divorce after 18 months of living separated, implying they would split-up after their honeymoon. House and Cuddy discuss Cuddy's wedding gown of preference and House says that it wouldn't be Cuddy's first marriage if she married. She says that it would, but deducing from her remark about New Jersey divorce laws, House says that he had checked the records stating that she was married for six days in 1987 and that she lied to him, but he forgives her. Cuddy storms off. Taub notices his wife take her cellphone to the bathroom that morning and suspects that she's having an affair. Confronting her about it, he learns that she's been corresponding with somebody from an infidelity support group. At the wedding dinner, Taub and Rachel have an argument about her friend. Rachel stands her ground, implying taking revenge on Taub's adulterous past. After the dinner, during a conversation with Taub, Foreman, and Wilson, House gets an idea and runs back to the hospital. He visits the patient and tells him that the annual CT scans that his daughter receives were unable to detect tiny spots of remaining tumor and the PET scans he did revealed them. He concludes that the patient should receive the treatment because God had already broken the bargain. Embittered, the patient agrees. Later on, House reveals that he had been lying, but that the patient is recovering. Instead of losing his faith, he thinks that the proof that, even after accepting stem cell treatment, God did not punish him proves that God is merciful and all about love, as his daughter said. Meanwhile, Wilson tells House that Sam asked him to review her medical files in order for things to run smooth for a management change. House checks them in Wilson's absence and remarks that Sam had five files which point towards a misconduct about medicine doses. Wilson struggles for a cover but House reassures him that Sam must have done so because the patients were most likely terminal and overdosing would serve as some sort of relief, adding that Sam and Wilson were a perfect match. Wilson reveals that he's going to propose during the wedding. Wilson proposes to Sam by telling her how impressed he is about her moral sense about those five cases. Sam is afraid of commitment and gets cold feet. She covers it up by accusing Wilson that she was honest when she said she did not interfere and blames Wilson for not trusting her. Wilson comes home to see Sam packing up ready to flee. After a volatile argument about confidence, Sam dumps Wilson and runs away. At the end of the episode, House apologizes to Cuddy and asks for a leap of faith, promising never to lie to her again. That night, Wilson comes over to House's apartment. House tells him that he apologized to Cuddy but in fact he was lying again.

These green areas and old endemic trees of Lahore are home to many resident birds as well as providing to seasonal migrants. The grounds of different habitats such as Lahore Zoo and the Lawrence Gardens, Mayo and Jinnah Gardens, GOR, Jallo Park, Kinnaird College, Government College University, Aitchison College and many others are home to various bird species. Ornithologists of preceding times documented the number of bird species in Lahore. According to one study conducted in 1965 there were 240 bird species. In another study (1992) only 101 bird species from the parks of Lahore were recorded. However, with an increase in the rate of urbanisation, the ecology of Lahore has been considerably affected and bird population reduced to 85, including both residents and migrants. Resident species include Indian grey hornbill, yellow- footed green pigeon, parakeets, bulbuls, doves, spotted owlet, Old World babblers, Old World flycatchers, mynas, woodpeckers, crows, black kites, ashy prinia, redstarts, warblers, red-wattled lapwing, kingfishers, and the Indian white-eye. Three types of migratory birds are regular visitors to Punjab‚Äôs provincial metropolis. These are winter visitors, summer visitors and transit migrants. The winter visitors come in September and stay until May. They come from northern latitudes and higher altitudes and include yellow-browed warbler, common starling, white wagtail, yellow wagtail and white-browed wagtail in search of food. The wagtails eat small insects, spiders, mollusks and soft seeds from moist soil. They roost in tall Typha and reed growth on the banks of ponds and lakes. Summer visitors arrive from southern parts of the country; these include Asian koel, purple sunbird, golden oriole and cuckoos. They also come here in search of food and for breeding.

He has won several national and international medals for India. He is the only shooter in the world who has won the double trap event of the International Shooting Junior World Cup for two consecutive years.  Career = Early career (2005‚Äì2006)  Asher Noria is the son of Gusti Jall Noria, a former double trap specialist from India. He is the younger brother of Youhan Noria, an ex- National shooter. He picked up shooting from his father at a very young age. His mother Mita Noria and father supported him by being there with him when he participated at competitions. Having come from a shooting family, shooting skills came naturally to Noria. As an 11-year-old in 2005, Asher Noria participated in the double trap event. He was first seen at a shooting championship in Hyderabad. Six time Olympian, Juan Giha, saw a lot of promise in Noria at such a young age. Although Noria originally started as a trap shooter, he switched to double trap owing to his success in it. Noria trained for five months under the aegis of Ronjan Sodhi. Noria trains for physical fitness using team games, cardio routines and running around Hyderabad's Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park.  Success (2007 ‚Äì present) Noria represented Andhra Pradesh in national level competitions winning several medals. From 2007 onwards, he started winning medals for India in international competitions. Noria's foray into international competitions began with Cyprus World Championships where he finished sixth. At the Kuwait Asian Shooting Championships, he met Ahmed bin Hasher Al Maktoum, his idol and the gold medal winner in the double trap event at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Noria found this meeting to be inspirational and holds it close to his heart. At the 2008 Singapore Open, Noria won his first international gold medal. His next gold medal came 2 months later at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games, where he bettered the national record set by Rajyavardhan Rathore at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Noria won the gold medal at the 2009 International Junior World Cup Shooting Championship in the same category. At the 2010 World Championships in Munich, Noria won the gold medal in junior double trap event. In the process, he also created a new national record in the junior category. In appreciation of his performance in Munich, the Sahara Group felicitated Noria with a cash prize of . = 2010 Commonwealth Games = Because Rajyavardhan Rathore chose to protest the selection process, Noria was selected to represent India at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. He was chosen for all the shotgun events along with Ronjan Sodhi and Manavjit Singh Sandhu. In the run-up to the Games, India's coach said that Noria was one of the young shooters to watch out for. However, Noria felt that it would be a challenge for him to match Rathore. In the men's double trap pairs event, Noria paired with Ranjan Sodhi to win the silver medal. In the double trap individual event, Noria missed the bronze medal narrowly. Sodhi, who won the silver medal, commended Noria's first international performance in the men's category.  Education  Noria finished his schooling at Hyderabad Public School. He was the school head-boy. In August 2010, he enrolled at Armstrong Atlantic State University with a plan to major in engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Despite moving to the United States, Noria clarified that he will continue the sport for India.

It is a combination of medicare, teaching and research to be in line with the international practices, that provides medical services for patients covered by Beijing social medical insurance, commercial insurance, public medicare and foreign insurances. The overall investment for the hospital is 3.2 billion, with a building area of . It is currently under construction starting from March 2010, and will become the largest single medical building in Asia. The hospital is located in the Zhongguancun Life Science Park. The investment was made by Beijing International Hospital Group. Qide Han, the vice chairperson of the National People's Congress (NPC) of the People's Republic of China, Chief Office of Beijing University Health Science Center, will serve as the Honorary Chairman of the board. Overview The hospital positions itself as a general hospital centering on several dominant disciplines, based on the subject specialties of Peking University. 36 medical centers and 49 medical disciplines are determined. As an affiliated hospital of Peking University, it is inherited from the strong disciplines of the university, as well as evolves many of its subjects. The disciplines to be focused on are: cardiovascular department, neoplasms/blood department, ophthalmology department, women and children's department, neuroscience department, urology department and renal disease department. Scope of service Clinical services: * Cardiovascular * Neoplasms/Blood * Ophthalmology * Women and children's care * Neuroscience * Urology * Renal disease Hospital building design Through a design competition, Peking University International Hospital sought a design for a satellite facility in the growing suburbs. Perkins Eastman proposed a , 12-story hospital for the parcel of land located about northwest of central Beijing. To bring organization to a large site, the design team chose a circle inscribed inside a square as the overall design element. The landscaped square gives the site a defined border, and the circular ambulatory care and cancer center building harmoniously organize different large-scale program elements. The design reflects the three-part organization of the medical zone: patient care towers, outpatient ambulatory care wing, and medical technology space; and gives each portion a distinct and appropriate appearance. Patient bed towers are carefully sited to comply with requirements for direct exposure to the south to provide light and views. The two-phase plan calls for 2,000 hospital beds, an ambulatory care center to serve 10,000 outpatients daily, and a large emergency department with adult and pediatric areas. Specialized services encompass centers for cardiovascular services, oncology, women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs services, and a conference center.Eastman, Beijing University International Hospital introduction References External links  * Official website mainly Chinese * Official website mainly English, only English frame, no content Category:Hospitals in Beijing Category:Buildings and structures under construction in China Category:Haidian District ","title":"Peking University International Hospital"},{"id":"29138873","text":"Ariyamangalam () is one of the four zones of the Tiruchirappalli Municipal Corporation.

Though primarily a penciler and inker of interior comic art, he has also done work as a cover artist, colorist and writer. Early life and influences Rafael Albuquerque was born in 1981 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Career Albuquerque begun his professional career working in advertising, doing work for local companies. He began his comic book career in 2002, after posting his portfolio on the Internet, doing work for the Egyptian publishing company AK Comics, which published books for the Middle East. In 2005, Albuquerque published the creator-owned graphic novel crime story Rumble in La Rambla. It would be published in the United States in 2007 by Image Comics under the title Crimeland. He collaborated with writers Keith Giffen and Alan Grant in 2006 by illustrating issues #4 and #5 of Jeremiah Harm and the first issue of Pirate Tales for Boom! Studios. In 2006 and 2007, he illustrated the mini series Savage Brothers, also for Boom! Studios. In 2007 he drew Wonderlost #2 by writer C. B. Cebulski, and \\"Oil for Blood\\", a story in volume 2 of 24Seven, both published by Image Comics. The latter was nominated for the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Anthology (though the anthology's editor, Ivan Brandon, was the named nominee, and not the individual creators). Albuquerque first gained the notice of U.S. comics readers with his work as the regular artist on the DC Comics monthly series Blue Beetle, which he drew from issues #10 (February 2007) to #34 (February 2009). The series proved to be a challenge to Albuquerque, who thought the mainstream superhero book was not well-suited to his darker style, and approached the book by employing less heavy blacks and ink splats, and a more \\"cartoony\\" storytelling style. His other DC work has included covers of several titles, as well as interior work on issues #52 and #53 of Superman/Batman. and the Robin/Spoiler Special #1 in 2008. That same year, Albuquerque illustrated writer Ivan Brandon's story, \\"Wild Goose\\", which appeared in the Dark Horse Comics anthology Tales of the Fear Agent. In 2009 he drew issues #3 and #4 of Strange Adventures and drew the covers to Marvel Comics' four-issue miniseries Nomad: Girl Without a World. In January 2010, Newsarama named Albuquerque one of ten creators to watch for the coming year. Albuquerque, with Eduardo Medeiros and Mateus Santolouco, wrote Mondo Urbano, a graphic novel published by Oni Press. That same year Albuquerque began illustrating American Vampire, a horror series published by DC Comics' Vertigo imprint, the first five issues of which consisted of two separate stories, one by Scott Snyder and one by Stephen King, marking King's first original work for comics. Albuquerque illustrated the two stories with different styles, representative of both the personalities of the characters and the eras in which they were set, explaining that he utilized high-contrast blacks and whites for the 1920s story featuring Pearl in order to evoke the films of that era, and a \\"dirtier, sketchier technique\\" involving traditional inking, ink wash and pencils for the 1880s story featuring bank robber Skinner, in order to evoke that story's \\"rough and violent\\" setting. The first hardcover collection appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list, and the series won IGN's Best of 2010 Award, 2011 Eisner Award and the 2011 Harvey Award, all of them for Best New Series. In 2012 Albuquerque illustrated and wrote his first story for DC Comics, which appeared in Legends of the Dark Knight. He drew backup stories for Batman vol. 2 #21‚Äì23 (August‚ÄìOctober 2013) as part of the \\"Batman: Zero Year\\" storyline.Manning \\"2010s\\" in Dougall, p. 336: Batman #21 \\"This issue...also featured a back-up tale written by Scott Snyder and James Tynion IV, and drawn by Rafael Albuquerque.\\" Albuquerque publishes a creator- owned webcomic in Brazil titled Tune 8, which follows a time traveler named Joshua who has only a disembodied female voice as to guide him through the foreign and inhospitable place in which he finds himself. Tune 8 was serialized on the Brazilian website IG.com.br, and later became the 5-part mini series Eight, published by Dark Horse Comics. In 2013, he co-scripted with frequent collaborator Scott Snyder the 64-page American Vampire one-shot The Long Road to Hell. Personal life Albuquerque lives in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

A variable with value of 1 corresponds to a cell with an object. Contrary, a variable with value of 0 corresponds to an empty cell‚Äîno hidden object. Overview These puzzles are based on algebra with binary variables taking a pair of values, for example, (no, yes), (false, true), (not exists, exists), (0, 1). It invites the player quickly establish some equations, and inequalities for the solution. The partitioning can be used to reduce the complexity of the problem. Moreover, if the puzzle is prepared in a way that there exists a unique solution only, this fact can be used to eliminate some variables without calculation. The problem can be modeled as binary integer linear programming which is a special case of integer linear programming.Schrijver 1986 History Minesweeper, along with its variants, is the most notable example of this type of puzzle. Algebra with binary variables Below the letters in the mathematical statements are used as variables where each can take the value either 0 or 1 only. A simple example of an equation with binary variables is given below: :a + b = 0 Here there are two variables a and b but one equation. The solution is constrained by the fact that a and b can take only values 0 or 1. There is only one solution here, both a = 0, and b = 0. Another simple example is given below: :a + b = 2 The solution is straightforward: a and b must be 1 to make a + b equal to 2. Another interesting case is shown below: :a + b + c = 2 :a + b ‚â§ 1 Here, the first statement is an equation and the second statement is an inequality indicating the three possible cases: #a = 1 and b = 0, #a = 0 and b = 1, and #a = 0 and b = 0, The last case causes a contradiction on c by forcing c = 2, which is not possible. Therefore, either first or second case is correct. This leads to the fact that c must be 1. The modification of a large equation into smaller form is not difficult. However, an equation set with binary variables cannot be always solved by applying linear algebra. The following is an example for applying the subtraction of two equations: :a + b + c + d = 3 :c + d = 1 The first statement has four variables whereas the second statement has only two variables. The latter one means that the sum of c and d is 1. Using this fact on the first statement, the equations above can be reduced to :a + b = 2 :c + d = 1 The algebra on a board Figure 1: An example puzzle on 4x4 board A game based on the algebra with binary variables can be visualized in many different ways. One generic way is to represent the right side of an equation as a clue in a cell (clue cell), and the neighbors of a clue cell as variables. A simple case is shown in Figure 1. The neighbors can be assumed to be the up/down, left/right, and corner cells that are sharing an edge or a corner. The white cells may contain a hidden object or nothing. In other words, they are the binary variables. They take place on the left side of the equations. Each clue cell, a cell with blue background in Figure 1, contains a positive number corresponding to the number of its neighbors that have hidden objects. The total number of the objects on the board can be given as an additional clue. The same board with variables marked is shown in Figure 2. The reduction into a set of equations with binary variables The main equation is written by using the total number of the hidden objects given. From the first figure this corresponds to the following equation :a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + m = 3 The other equations are composed one by one for each clue cells: :a + b + c + e + f + h + i + j = 1 :f + g + j + m = 1 :h + i + j + k = 2 :i + j + m = 2 Although there are several ways to solve the equations above, the following explicit way can be applied: #It is known from the equation set that i + j + m = 2. However, since j and m are neighbors of a cell with number 1, the following is true: j + m ‚â§ 1. This means that the variable i must be 1. #Since i = 1 and the variable i is the neighbor to the clue cell with number 1, the variables a, b, c, e, f, h, and j must be zero. The same result can be obtained by replacing i = 1 into the second equation as follows: a + b + c + e + f + h + j = 0. This is equivalent to a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, e = 0, f = 0, h = 0, j = 0. #Figure 3 is obtained after Step 1 and Step 2. The grayed cells with '‚Äì' are the variables with value 0. The cell with the symbol Œî corresponds to the variable with value 1. The variable k is the only neighbor of the left most clue cell with value 2. This clue cell has one neighbor with an object and only one remaining cell with variable k. Therefore, k must be 1. #Similarly, the variable m must be 1 too because it is the only remaining variable neighbor to the right most clue cell with value 2. #Since k = 1, m = 1 and i = 1, we complete the marking of three hidden objects therefore d = 0, and g = 0. The final solution is given in Figure 4. {Figure 2: Binary variables are marked  Figure 3: The example solved partially  Figure 4: The example solved } Use of uniqueness In the example above (Figure 2), the variables a, b, c, and e are the neighbors of the clue cell 1 and they are not neighbors of any other cell. It is obvious that the followings are possible solutions: *a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, e = 0 *a = 0, b = 1, c = 0, e = 0 *a = 0, b = 0, c = 1, e = 0 *a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, e = 1 However, if the puzzle is prepared so that we should have one only one (unique) solution, we can set that all these variables a, b, c, and e must be 0. Otherwise there become more than one solutions. Use of partitioning Figure 5: An example for partitioning Some puzzle configurations may allow the player to use partitioningHalmos 1960 for complexity reduction. An example is given in Figure 5. Each partition corresponds to a number of the objects hidden. The sum of the hidden objects in the partitions must be equal to the total number of objects hidden on the board. One possible way to determine a partitioning is to choose the lead clue cells which have no common neighbors. The cells outside of the red transparent zones in Figure 5 must be empty. In other words, there are no hidden objects in the all-white cells. Since there must be a hidden object within the upper partition zone, the third row from top shouldn't contain a hidden object. This leads to the fact that the two variable cells on the bottom row around the clue cell must have hidden objects. The rest of the solution is straightforward. Use of try-and-check method Figure 6: An example for try-and-check method At some cases, the player can set a variable cell as 1 and check if any inconsistency occurs. The example in Figure 6 shows an inconsistency check. The cell marked with an hidden object Œî is under the test. Its marking leads to the set all the variables (grayed cells) to be 0. This follows the inconsistency. The clue cell marked red with value 1 does not have any remaining neighbor that can include a hidden object. Therefore, the cell under the test must not include a hidden object. In algebraic form we have two equations: :a + b + c + d = 1 :a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 1 Here a, b, c, and d correspond to the top four grayed cells in Figure 6. The cell with Œî is represented by the variable f, and the other two grayed cells are marked as e and g. If we set f = 1, then a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, e = 0, g = 0. The first equation above will have the left hand side equal to 0 while the right hand side has 1. A contradiction. Try-and-check may need to be applied consequently in more than one step on some puzzles in order to reach a conclusion. This is equivalent to binary search algorithmDrozdek 2000 to eliminate possible paths which lead to inconsistency. Complexity Because of binary variables, the equation set for the solution does not possess linearity property. In other words, the rank of the equation matrix may not always address the right complexity. The complexity of this class of puzzles can be adjusted in several ways. One of the simplest method is to set a ratio of the number of the clue cells to the total number of the cells on the board. However, this may result a largely varying complexity range for a fixed ratio. Another method is to reduce clue cells based on some problem solving strategies step by step. The complex strategies may be enabled for high complexity levels such as subtracting an equation with another one, or the higher depth of try-and-check steps. When the board size increases, the range of the problem cases increases. The ratio of the number of hidden objects to the total number of cells affects the complexity of the puzzle too.

It was part of the Huguenot rebellions. Background Louis XIII stationed his troops around Montpellier in July 1622. p. 103ff A treaty was agreed upon between Henri, Duke of Rohan, and Louis XIII, through his officer, Marshal Lesdigui√®res; it was signed by Rohan on 22 August 1622. The inhabitants of Montpellier, however, refused to open their gate to royal troops, fearing depredation by Henri, Prince of Cond√© and demanded humiliating conditions if the King wished to enter the city. Siege Cond√© initially led the siege. Outraged, Louis XIII revoked Lesdigui√®res' command, and ordered his troops to set up a siege of the city. The besieging army was placed unter the command of Cond√©. Etienne d'Americ led the defense of Montpellier in an energetic manner. Operations proved to be difficult for the troops of Louis XIII. Royal troops captured the bastion of Saint-Denis on 2 September, which had a commanding position over the city, but the stronghold was recaptured by the Huguenots the following day, leaving 200 dead in the royal army. Also on 2 September, 400 Huguenots under Galonges, the Commander of the Montpellier garrison, made a sortie and defeated 1000 royal troops. On 2 October the Huguenots were able to repel three assaults by royal troops numbering 5,000. The assault left from 300 to 400 dead in the royal camps, and many more wounded. At the same time, the royal army was plagued with sickness and was running short of supplies. Aftermath Lesdigui√®res negotiated the peace between the King and the Huguenots at Montpelliers. Finally, Louis XIII authorized negotiations to be resumed, asking Lesdigui√®res to lead the army once more, and to secretly negotiate at the same time. On 8 October Rohan arrived in front of Montpellier with a relief army 4,000 veterans. He might have fought victoriously, but he desired to negotiate, as he was running short of international support. The inhabitants agreed to make amends, and the King granted his pardon, leading to the signature of the Treaty of Montpellier on 19 October, in which the King fully confirmed the observation of the Edict of Nantes, but the Huguenots agreed to the dismantlement of the fortifications of Montpellier, N√Æmes and Uz√®s. p. 187 Louis XIII finally entered Montpellier on 20 October 1622, bareheaded and unarmed. p. 107 Royal troops entered the city, effectively occupied it, and started to dismantle its fortifications. p. 112] The Citadel of Montpellier was built soon after by Louis XIII in order to better control the city.

It is a version of the arcade game Qix. The game was released for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro in 1984 and for the Commodore 64 in 1985. Description In-game screenshot (BBC Micro) Although the gameplay is similar to Qix, the backstory for Frenzy involves the player controlling a robot craft, attempting to capture deadly sub-atomic Leptons from inside a scientific research centre. In Frenzy, a Lepton is captured if it is trapped in an area enclosed by the player's robot craft or if 95% of the screen area has been filled. The robot craft has two speeds and the score for filling in an area using only the slower speed is subject to a 2x multiplier. Chasers appear in higher levels which can collide with the player's robot craft, causing a life to be lost. The number of Leptons and Chasers increase as the levels progress, up to a maximum of five of each on the most difficult screens‚Äîexcept for Levels 12 and 14, which have a smaller number of Leptons (and no Chasers) but the Leptons move much faster. The player obtains an extra craft on completing the third, sixth and ninth screens. It has been found that after level 14, the last two screens repeat indefinitely. It is stated in the instructions that a good strategy is to build narrow filled blocks using the faster speed across the centre of an unfilled area, and then finally seal the area off by using only the slower mode. This maximises the score while reducing the risk of using \\"slow mode\\" to a minimum. It can be seen that players of the game tend to stick to this strategy. Some players remark that Frenzy is not an exact Qix clone. Although the game is clearly derived from Qix, there are crucial differences. In Qix, completing a line fills in the area not containing the Qix regardless of size, whereas in Frenzy, the smaller area is always coloured, allowing Leptons to be trapped (which kills them). In Qix, filling a set percentage is the only way to complete levels; in Frenzy it is more common to complete levels by killing all the Leptons. Also, in Frenzy, the Leptons move in a regular, completely deterministic pattern, and the player's robot craft is permitted to hesitate, making Frenzy a different playing experience to Qix. Critical reception Generally, the game has received a positive response from both players and reviewers. Frenzy was reviewed in the August 1984 edition of Acorn User (Issue 25) and also in issue 2.06 of Electron User. Adam Young in his review entitled \\"Simplicity Makes a Winner\\" described the game as \\"one of the most amusing and compulsive games on the market\\" and \\"excellent\\". Oliver Robinson stated \\"I always enjoyed playing Frenzy by Micropower\\". Comparing the game to another similar game called Kix he wrote, \\"Although, Kix arguably had better music, Frenzy had better gameplay\\". (The music to Kix is \\"Scarborough Fair\\" and \\"House of the Rising Sun\\"; Frenzy actually has no music at all.) Other players have described the game as \\"a great family favourite\\", a \\"favourite game\\" and \\"Simple, but Addictive\\".

Biography  Chirikov was born in Kazan into a gentry family. His father, a former office in the Imperial Russian Army, was a policeman. He studied mathematics at Kazan University, and became interested in populist ideas, joining revolutionary student circles and an early Marxist group founded in Kazan by N. E. Fedoseyev. He was expelled in 1887 for taking part in student demonstrations, and exiled to Nizhni Novgorod. He was arrested in January 1888 for writing and publicly performing an antimonarchist poem, and in 1892 for his involvement in a group of young followers of Narodnaya Volya. He lived in several cities during this time, always under police surveillance. His first articles appeared in the Kazan newspaper Volga Herald in 1885. He published his first story Red in January 1886, in the same paper. That same year, he met Maxim Gorky while living in Tsaritsyn. A few months later, after moving to Astrakhan, he met radical writer and critic Nikolai Chernyshevsky. He continued to publish his works in the provincial papers until 1894, when one of his stories was accepted by Nikolay Mikhaylovsky for publication in the Saint Petersburg magazine Russkoye Bogatstvo. This publication allowed Chirikov to begin publishing in other major magazines, including Vestnik Evropy and Severny Vestnik. In the 1890s he moved to Samara, a place that exercised a strong influence on his ideological and artistic evolution. He re- examined his old populist views and maintained steady contact with the marxist movement, and though he never became deeply involved, he continued to hold democratic views. His works of the period give truthful and sympathetic depictions of the life of the peasants and their struggles with poverty and government indifference, and the stale and boring lives of lower and middle- class people living in small towns and cities. He was considered as a successor to the Narodnik writers of the 1860s, such as Nikolai Uspensky, Fyodor Mikhaylovich Reshetnikov, and Alexander Levitov. His works of the late 1890s and early 1900s began to be critical of the Populist movement, drawing negative criticism from Mikhaylovsky and fellow Populist Alexander Skabichevsky, and breaking Chirikov's connection with Russkoye Bogatstvo. In 1900-1901 Chirikov contributed to the magazine Life, which also published works by Gorky and Vladimir Lenin. Portrait of Chirikov by Ilia Repin, 1906 After the closing of Life in 1901, he was drawn into the Znanie Publishing Company (Knowledge), by Gorky, which published his collected works in 1908. Chirikov also became a shareholder in Znanie. His most important play The Jews (1903), was directed against national oppression and repression, and the autocratic Tsarist regime. The value of this play, which gained praise from Maxim Gorky, was determined not so much by its artistic qualities, as the relevance of its issues. Its journalistic sharpness, clear demarcation of social characters, and progressive ideological outlook demonstrated an affinity with the dramatic works of Gorky. The play was banned from production on the Russian stage, but was widely performed abroad (Germany, Austria, France and other countries). The significant ideological and creative growth that Chirikov experienced in the period of the Revolution of 1905 testified to his powerful concern for the social and political problems of the time. In the story \\"The Rebels\\" (1905), the drama The Guys (1905), and the story \\"Comrade\\" (1906), he was able to faithfully capture the widespread growth of the revolutionary struggle, and the confusion of the authorities under the onslaught of a powerful popular movement. In the years after the 1905 Revolution, Chirikhov began to disagree with the various changing positions of the revolutionary period: these ideological fluctuations had a negative impact on the writer, leading to his alienation from the revolutionary movement. Chirikov left Znanie and began to publish in decadent journals and collections. This move was regarded by his Marxist friends Gorky, Anatoly Lunacharsky, and Vatslav Vorovsky as an ideological apostasy. Chirikov's departure from the realist tradition started with the publication of his plays Red Lights and Legend of the old castle (both 1907), written under the strong influence of Leonid Andreyev. He next published a series of stories on religious themes (\\"Temptation\\", \\"Devi mountains\\", etc.), and the play Forest Secrets (1911), styled after the works of Aleksey Remizov. However, Chirikov did not give up his attempts at realism, publishing an autobiographical trilogy of novels entitled The Life of Tarkhanov (1911 - 1914), which included the novels Youth, Exile, and The Return (he later wrote a fourth part, Family). The 1917 Russian Revolution led Chirikov to completely break with his past democratic sympathies. In 1921 he left Russia and moved to Sofia, Bulgaria, before settling in Prague in 1922. His novel The Beast from the Abyss, written after he left Russia, was critical of the roles of both the Bolsheviks and the White Guards in the Russian Revolution of 1917. He died in Prague in 1932.

History There is uncertainty about the origins of motocross but it is likely that it began in 1914 when the Scott Trial was started by Alfred Angas Scott, owner and founder of The Scott Motorcycle Company. The Scott Trial was held on the Yorkshire moors in Northern England and after World War I test riders of new British motorcycles started racing against each other on off-road factory courses. The French came up with the term 'moto cross' to describe this off- road racing and the first recorded Motocross competition was on Camberley Heath in Surrey, England on 29 March 1924. Classes The British Motocross Championship competition is organised into classes of MX1 and MX2. MX1 is for 251cc to 450cc (fourstroke) and MX2 for 175cc to 250cc fourstroke motorcycles. In 2007 an additional youth class, the MXY2 class, was added to the programme at selected rounds. A 'Veterans' series was introduced in 2009 with just two rounds but the demand for places was so high that from 2011 the Veterans series will have three rounds, held over six races. Auto-Cycle Union The Auto-Cycle Union (ACU) is the governing body of the British Motocross Championship. The ACU sets the rules for the British Motocross Championship and organises the training of stewards and marshals to ensure track safety. The ACU also sets and checks safety standards and tracks the progress of national championships. The ACU has an important role to defend and develop motorcycle sport and is independent of any commercial organisation. The Patron of the ACU is the Duke of Edinburgh. Sponsorship The British Motocross Championship competition is sponsored by Taiwanese tyre manufacturer MAXXIS and the competition is referred to as the MAXXIS ACU British Motocross Championship.

Early life and education Carl Aller was born in Copenhagen on 25 November 1845, the son of brewer Christian Hansen Aller (1797‚Äì1852) and Juliane Christine Geschel el. Gechel (ca. 1806‚Äì72). He apprenticed as a lithographer in C. F. Aamodt's studio. Career In am early age, Aller invented a new photolithographic method of image production. In 1869, he was awarded the √òrsted Grant for his invention. Together with his wife, Laura Aller, he founded Carl Aller's Etablissement in 1873 and in 1874 they began the publication of Nordisk M√∏nster Tidende (later Femina). In 1877, they launched a new magazine Illustrated Family Journal (Danish: Illustreret Familie Journal), with Laura Aller as editor-in-chief. The magazine experienced immediate success, partly due to the high quality of its illustrations. Aller improved printing techniques by transferring them to a lithographic stone and was for a long time the only publisher in Denmark to offer illustrations in nine colours. The company expanded fast, both through organic growth and acquisitions of numerous other printing businesses. Swedish Aller (Svenska Aller AB) was founded in 1894 and Norwegian Aller (Norsk Aller A/S) in 1897, both under the leadership of one of Carl and Laura Aller's sons. The first art supplement from 1897: Otto Bache's equestrian portrait of Christian IX of Denmark Popularizing art From 1897, Illustrated Family Journal came with an art supplement. This contributed to bringing art into the homes of the wider population and popularizing both artists and artworks. The first art supplement was a reproduction of Otto Bache's equestrian portrait of King Christian IX of Denmark. Private life Laura and Carl Aller Aller married Laura Christiane Bierring (14 January 1849 - 9 October 1917), a daughter of merchant Lauritz J√∏rgen B.

The plot follows Josh Kovaks (Ben Stiller), Charlie Gibbs (Casey Affleck) and Enrique Dev'reaux (Michael Pe√±a), employees of an exclusive apartment building who lose their pensions in the Ponzi scheme of Wall Street businessman Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda). The group enlist the aid of criminal Slide (Eddie Murphy), bankrupt businessman Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) and another employee of the apartment building, Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe), to break into Shaw's apartment and steal back their money while avoiding the FBI agent in charge of his case, Claire Denham (T√©a Leoni). Tower Heist began development as early as 2005, based on an idea by Murphy that would star himself and an all-black cast of comedians as a heist group who rob Trump International Hotel and Tower. As the script developed and changed into an Ocean's Eleven-style caper, Murphy left the project. Ratner continued to develop the idea into what would eventually become Tower Heist, with Murphy later rejoining the production. Filming took place entirely in New York City on a budget of $75 million (after tax rebates), with several buildings provided by Donald Trump used to represent the eponymous tower. The film score was composed by Christophe Beck and released commercially on November 1, 2011. The film received mixed reviews with much of the praise going to the cast, including Broderick, Leoni and Stiller. However, Murphy was repeatedly singled out by critics as the star of the film, with critics feeling that he displayed a welcome return to the comedic style of his early career. Much of the criticism received by the film was focused on the plot, which was considered \\"formulaic,\\" \\"rushed,\\" \\"dull\\" and \\"laborious.\\" The film was released on November 4, 2011 and earned $152 million worldwide. Prior to release, the film was involved in a controversy over plans by Universal Pictures to release it for home viewing on video on demand to 500,000 Comcast customers, only three weeks after its theatrical debut. Concern over the implementation's harming ticket sales and inspiring further films to follow suit resulted in several theater chains' refusal to show the film at all if the plan went ahead, forcing Universal to abandon the idea. Plot Josh Kovaks is the building manager of The Tower, an upscale apartment complex in New York City. Its employees include Josh's brother-in-law, concierge Charlie Gibbs, who is expecting a child with Josh's sister; Enrique Dev'Reaux, a newly hired elevator operator; Lester, the doorman nearing retirement; Odessa Montero, an immigrant maid from Jamaica threatened with deportation; and receptionist Miss Iovenko, who is studying to become a lawyer. One morning Josh witnesses what he believes is Arthur Shaw, The Tower's penthouse tenant, being kidnapped. Josh gives chase, but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham, who explains to Josh that Shaw was actually attempting to flee the country to resist arrest for masterminding a Ponzi scheme, embezzling $2 billion. Josh confesses to the Tower staff that he gave their pensions to Shaw to invest, and they have lost everything; Lester attempts suicide by stepping in front of a train, but survives. After visiting Lester in the hospital, Josh, Charlie, and Enrique confront Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Shaw expresses condolences, but is not sincere enough when he forgets to ask if Lester is all right. Out of anger, Josh smashes the windows of the 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso displayed in Shaw's apartment living room. Josh's boss Mr. Simon fires him for his actions, as well as Charlie and Enrique. Josh meets Denham at a bar where she drunkenly suggests that Shaw has concealed $20 million as a reserve, and that Josh should steal it. Josh, Charlie, Enrique, and evicted Tower tenant Mr. Fitzhugh conspire to find and steal the money from Shaw's assumed safe. They supplement their inexperience by enlisting Josh's childhood friend Slide, a petty criminal, and Odessa, who has locksmith experience that can help open the safe. Charlie is rehired as The Tower's new manager, and still feeling uncomfortable with Josh's plan, warns Josh that he must abandon it, or Charlie will turn him over to the police. Subsequently, Denham informs Josh that Shaw is scheduled to attend court on Thanksgiving during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade to avoid publicity, and that Shaw will likely be set free. Josh and his team decide to break into Shaw's apartment during the parade. Slide attempts to betray the team by reaching the safe ahead of them and taking all of the money for himself, having tricked Odessa into giving him lessons. The team intercepts him at Shaw's apartment, and during the ensuing altercation, they break down a false wall, revealing Shaw's safe, which turns out to be empty. Slide and Fitzhugh fight over Slide's gun, which Fitzhugh accidentally fires, and the bullet hits the Ferrari's hood, revealing gold underneath the paint. They realize that Shaw invested his money in gold, turned it into car parts, and assembled the car to hide the money in plain sight, which is worth 45 millions in total. They then decide to lower it to Fitzhugh's old apartment using a window-washing platform and then push it on top of one of the elevators. Later, Josh finds a ledger of Shaw's illegal finances in the car's glove box, and Charlie rejoins the team after realizing their presence and saves Fitzhugh from falling to his death. Shaw and the FBI return, revealing the Thanksgiving Day court date to be part of Josh's plan. Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe, and remands him back into federal custody until his real court date for violating his bail by not declaring the latter. Denham and the FBI arrest all the conspirators but Slide as they walk out the tower. Josh reveals to Shaw he found the ledger. Shaw tries to negotiate a deal to everyone involved with cash ten times the value of the gold in the car in exchange for their silence, but they refuse his offer, reminding Shaw ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt accept tips at the tower‚Äù. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and will be Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts on the condition that Josh, being the primary conspirator, serve a minimal two-year sentence. Shaw pleads guilty and is sentenced to life in prison. The team retrieves the car from the swimming pool of the tower, takes it apart and sends various parts to Tower employees to compensate for their lost pensions while they spit the remaining of the gold for themselves. As Josh is led to his cell, a satisfied smile slowly forms on his face. Cast * Ben Stiller as Josh Kovaks :The Tower's manager. Stiller was paid $15 million for the role. * Eddie Murphy as Darnell \\"Slide\\" Davis :A petty crook and Josh's childhood friend whom Josh turns to for help. Murphy joined the cast on October 13, 2010, and became a producer on the film. He was paid $7.5 million for his work. * Casey Affleck as Charlie Gibbs :The Tower's concierge and Josh's brother-in-law. Affleck wanted to participate in the film as he was interested in playing a comedy role, saying \\"it sounded like a fun film to do. I wanted to do a comedy, and I thought this was an opportunity to try and be funny.\\" Grazer felt that Affleck would be perfect for the role because of his deadpan timing. * Alan Alda as Arthur Shaw :A Wall Street billionaire placed under house arrest for stealing $2 billion. On his character, Alda said \\"Shaw is sometimes described as a Bernie Madoff like character. I don't think anyone has ever operated on the scale that Madoff did. And I don't know if what Shaw did technically qualifies as a Ponzi scheme. Shaw was willing to steal money from people who really needed it - who couldn't afford to lose it - and was willing to take everything they had‚Ä¶yes, he's in Bernie territory, with both feet.\\" Ratner initially approached Robert Redford to play the role, being a fan of his work in the heist film The Hot Rock, but Redford turned him down. * Matthew Broderick as Mr. Fitzhugh :A bankrupt former Wall Street investor. Broderick joined the cast on October 26, 2010. * T√©a Leoni as Claire Denham :An FBI special agent assigned to Shaw's case. Leoni joined the cast on October 21, 2010. Leoni worked with FBI technical advisor Anne C. Beagan to prepare for her role. On her character and work with Beagan, Leoni said: \\"Agent Denham is your standard-issue, ball- breaking FBI agent. She's certainly a very tough lady, and it's not my first waltz with this type of character. However, I was able to spend some time with Anne, a great technical advisor we had on set. She's got this steely gaze that is terrifying, but what's underneath that is a very interesting lady. Beyond the technical aspects of the job, she provided so much more for me to use.\\" * Michael Pe√±a as Enrique Dev'reaux :The elevator operator and the newest employee of the building staff. Pe√±a was cast on October 19, 2010. * Gabourey Sidibe as Odessa Montero :A Jamaican-born maid threatened with deportation by Shaw's theft. To perform her character's Jamaican accent, Sidibe had three dialect coaches help her prepare along with a friend of Jamaican heritage. Additionally, Sidibe worked with an actual safecracker to accurately portray breaking into locks. Sidibe was cast on October 19, 2010. Judd Hirsch plays Mr. Simon, The Tower's General Manager, and Stephen Henderson plays Lester, The Tower's retiring doorman. Henderson was cast after the filmmakers saw his performance in August Wilson's Fences on Broadway. The cast is rounded out by Nina Arianda as Miss Iovenko, attorney-in-training, Juan Carlos Hernandez as Manuel, The Tower's head of security, Harry O'Reilly as FBI Agent Dansk, Marcia Jean Kurtz as Rose, Peter Van Wagner as attorney Marty Klein, James Colby as Special Agent Huggins and ≈Ωeljko Ivanek as FBI Director Mazin. Jessica Szohr plays Sasha Kovaks-Gibbs, Charlie's pregnant wife, who is also Josh's sister. Heavy D has a cameo appearance as a guard at a courthouse. Model Kate Upton cameos as the mistress of a Tower resident. Robert Downey Sr. has a cameo as Judge Ramos. Production=Development The idea for Tower Heist began development as early as 2005, when Murphy pitched a concept to producer Brian Grazer and Ratner concerning an all-star cast of black comedians including Chris Tucker, Kevin Hart, Dave Chappelle, Tracy Morgan, and Martin Lawrence, as a group of disgruntled employees who plan to rob Donald Trump and Trump International Hotel and Tower. The film was originally titled Trump Heist under this concept. A script was developed by Adam Cooper and Bill Collage and over the course of the next five years, the script was rewritten by several writers including Russell Gewirtz, Rawson Marshall Thurber, Ted Griffin, Leslie Dixon, Noah Baumbach, and Jeff Nathanson, with the bulk of the work - and credit - going to Griffin and Nathanson. Rewrites of the script gradually moved away from the ensemble of comedians and began to focus on two central characters, at which point Murphy left the project. For Ratner however, the modified script reminded him of the Ocean's Eleven remake, a project he had developed but for which he was unavailable due to his commitment to directing Rush Hour 2. The project remained in development for a period of years but Ratner remained committed to the project, having enjoyed the heist films of the 1970s including The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The Hot Rock, and The Anderson Tapes, turning down the opportunity to direct other films such as Horrible Bosses, which he instead produced. Ratner would also claim that he wanted to work with Murphy, whom Ratner partially credited as inspiring his Rush Hour films. As the script began to be finalized, Murphy was drawn back into the much changed project after being informed of Stiller's participation, with Murphy being offered the role of Slide. Murphy rejoined as both a cast member and producer, alongside Grazer and Kim Roth. In late October 2010, the film was finally scheduled for release, being given a November 4, 2011, release date. Writing Feeling the original concept was too close to Ocean's Eleven, Ratner attempted to recruit Rush Hour screenwriter Nathanson to perform additional work on the Tower Heist script, but at that time Nathanson was unavailable. Ratner instead hired Griffin, a writer on the Ocean's Eleven remake. Griffin \\"brought the real motivation and the heart to the concept\\", moving away from the premise of performing an ensemble heist on a rich Donald Trump type, and focusing instead on a group of blue-collar employees who take on a corrupt, thieving Bernard Madoff like businessman who has embezzled their pensions. Ratner enjoyed the pitch and brought it to Grazer who gave his approval. After taking the script to Stiller and bringing him into the project, Ratner had Noah Baumbach perform specific rewrites for Stiller's character. Nathanson then came aboard the project and performed the final rewrites to Griffin's screenplay in October 2010, adding \\"the obstacles, complexities and specificities of the characters.\\" To help develop the script, the filmmakers and writers spoke with the resident managers of several high-profile New York hotels to learn of their experiences interacting with their clientele. This research gave Griffin the idea for Shaw's possessing a vehicle in his apartment, which Grazer and Ratner eventually decided would be a rare 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso which once belonged to Steve McQueen. On his research, Nathanson said: > It was informative, to say the least, to speak with the people who work in > these buildings. I interviewed everyone from doormen to housekeepers to > building managers. There's a whole underworld to the New York building scene > that exists in the basements that most people are unaware of. They make it > all possible, and you just never see it. It's fascinating. Filming Filming recreates the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on location in New York City for the climax of the heist. Filming began on November 2010, taking place entirely in New York City on a budget of $85 million ($75 million after tax rebates). Production designer Kristi Zea visited several upscale hotels and high-rise residences to research the design elements to incorporate into the opulent surroundings of the tower and Shaw's penthouse. Zea created an amalgamation of the elements she saw during her research to create a sophisticated lobby design for the tower. For Shaw's penthouse, Zea took inspiration from a top-floor apartment in the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Central Park West in Columbus Circle. Zea populated the apartment with an assortment of art pieces to represent Shaw's status, based on specific artists and works that Ratner suggested. Zea decided to use modern-classic reproduction designs by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Cy Twombly, and Andy Warhol. Explaining her decision, Zea said \\"These days, it seems wealthy people want to have wall power. They want to have art on their walls that means something and shows people, just like a car, that, 'I'm rich, I'm smart and I know what I'm doing.'\\" Donald Trump allowed the production to use several of his own properties to portray the luxurious locales with the Trump International Hotel and Tower being used for exterior shots of the tower. Sections of the building were recreated on closed green screen sets for some of the film's visual effects. A foot and car chase sequence was filmed on Central Park West and Columbus Avenue. Some vehicle filming occurred on sound stages in Brooklyn. The burglary itself takes place during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, requiring the crew to film parts of the actual parade itself, and then recreate the event one week later for further filming. For Shaw's Ferrari, it was decided that purchasing an actual model - of which only 350 exist and would cost at least $1 million - would be too expensive and the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes. Instead, two replicas were commissioned, a process which took three months under the supervision of prop master Peter Gelfman. The replicas then received additional reinforcement for filming purposes from Steve Kirshoff and the special effects crew. After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors, it was decided to paint the replicas bright red in order to create a lasting impression instead of using the actual metallic brown muted-coloring of McQueen's vehicle. Sidibe and Murphy performed the only improvised scene, in which they are cracking a safe together. Test screenings did not result in any scenes being cut from the film, with Ratner claiming that the theatrical version is his \\"director's cut\\". However, he did remove scenes which he felt \\"didn't fit\\", or did not match the PG-13 rating the filmmakers were targeting. In post-production, Universal decided to film a new scene for the ending that would feature a reunion between Stiller and Murphy's characters. Murphy, however, refused to return unless he was paid a further $500,000 on top of his $7.5 million salary. The studio declined to pay the additional money and the scene was not shot. Music The soundtrack was composed by The Hangovers Christophe Beck. The Tower Heist Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on November 1, 2011, by Var√®se Sarabande. It consists of 22 tracks with a runtime of 40 minutes. Release The world premiere of Tower Heist took place on October 24, 2011, at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City. Box office Tower Heist earned $78,046,570 (51.0%) in the United States and Canada, and a further $74,884,053 (49.0%) elsewhere, for a worldwide box-office gross of $152,930,623. =United States and Canada= Pre-release audience tracking in the United States indicated that the film had strong awareness among males of all ages, followed by older women. Universal Pictures projected opening takings of $25-30 million during the opening weekend - aiming below expectations due to a slow marketplace - with rival studios claiming that the film would need to make at least $30 million to be a success. In the United States and Canada, Tower Heist opened in 3,367 theaters. The film took $85,000 from midnight screenings and a total of $8.5 million opening Friday, becoming the number one grossing film for the day. Although the film had been expected to be the number one film for the weekend, it took $10.5 million on the opening Saturday, falling behind the animated film Puss in Boots ($15.3 million). Tower Heist became the number two film for the weekend with $24 million, behind Puss in Boots ($34 million), with 70% of the audience being over the age of 25‚Äîthe largest segment, 27%, being over 50‚Äîand 56% male. The opening audience was ethnically diverse consisting of 48% Caucasian, 21% African American, and 21% Hispanic. =Markets elsewhere= Tower Heist was released on November 2, 2011, in the United Kingdom and opened in a total of 23 countries, including Germany, Spain, Hong Kong, and India, by November 4, 2011, at a total of 1,948 theaters. The opening weekend saw the film gross $9.5 million - an average of $5,000 per theater - with the largest earnings coming from the United Kingdom ($2.3 million at 416 theaters) where it was the number three film for the weekend, and Spain ($1.6 million at 300 theaters) where it was the number two film. Critical reception Eddie Murphy received praise from several critics who felt his performance was a return to his popular style of the 1980s, following a string of critical and commercial failures. Tower Heist received mixed reviews from critics. It garnered a 67% approval rating from 195 critics - an average rating of 6.17/10 - on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, whose consensus reads: \\"Tower Heist is a true Brett Ratner joint: little brains to this caper, but it's fun fluff, exciting to watch, and showcases a welcome return to form for Eddie Murphy.\\" Metacritic provides a score of 59 out of 100 from 39 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph called the film \\"a tolerably enjoyable Brett Ratner movie\\", labeling it \\"brash, forgettable fun.\\" However, Robey criticized Ratner for having the mostly white characters require the aid of a black character for the heist, saying \\"it's a little embarrassing that they can't conceive of doing this without bailing a black criminal out of jail but cultural sensitivity has never been Ratner's strong suit.\\" The Hollywood Reporter Todd McCarthy said that the film is \\"snappy, well cast and streetwise\\" but felt that it ignored the \\"contemporary economic issues at its core.\\" McCarthy said that Murphy's performance was a return to form as \\"the rude, confrontational, wiseass Murphy audiences have nearly forgotten after all the silly kid comedies and heavy- makeup outings of recent years,\\" and said that with his introduction \\"the film's energy and amusement level kick up a few notches,\\" but that the enjoyment ebbs during the actual break-in, in which \\"Murphy becomes neutered...and the logistics of the heist become too far-fetched and laborious.\\" New Yorks David Edelstein called it \\"a shameless but exuberantly well-done caper comedy,\\" and praised the performances of Stiller, Murphy and Leoni, saying \\"Ben Stiller...and Eddie Murphy... show off two of the best fastballs in comedy, and T√©a Leoni's best scene as an FBI agent - drunk, both sloppy and blunt - makes you wish she had more.\\" Emanuel Levy called Tower Heist a \\"formulaic, haphazardly plotted action comedy... whose best asset is its strong ensemble.\\" Levy said \\"What makes the picture... work is not its plot, which is overly familiar and utterly implausible, but the socio- psychological dynamics that prevail among the [characters].\\" Levy singled out Stiller as \\"well cast\\" and Sidibe as having \\"some of the picture's best lines,\\" but gave individual praise to Murphy, saying that he \\"dominates the second half of the picture,\\" rendering \\"a joyous performance that recalls his witty, charming, streetwise roles of the 1980s.\\" Empires Nick de Semlyen awarded the film three out of five stars, calling it \\"fun if uneven stuff from Ratner,\\" with a \\"fairly dull\\" opening act. Semlyen said it was \\"a welcome return to form for Eddie Murphy,\\" but was critical that he is \\"sorely underused.\\" Semlyen praised Alda, saying that it is his \\"smarm offensive that turns out to be the primary pleasure.\\" The Village Voices Nick Pinkteron said that the film \\"deserves credit as a clean, well-turned job, fleet and funny and inconsequential,\\" and appreciated the cast, praising Leoni as the \\"best thing going,\\" and Murphy's \\"inspired\\" contributions. However, Pinkerton was critical of the script, describing it as \\"amateur as its crooks: the audience isn't even fully aware of who's in on the job when it kicks off, while other threads are left dangling.\\" Roger Ebert awarded the film 2.5 out of 4, saying \\"This isn't a great heist movie for a lot of reasons, beginning with the stupidity of its heist plan and the impossibility of these characters ever being successful at anything more complex than standing in line,\\" but appreciated that the comedy did not \\"go heavy on the excremental, the masturbatory and symphonies of four-letter words\\", calling it \\"funny in an innocent screwball kind of way.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film \\"overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky,\\" and praised Murphy, saying \\"when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor... gooses the movie's energy level... but whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops. Tower Heist is in effect two movies: One belongs to Murphy, the other to the rest of the cast.\\" Time Out Londons Trevor Johnston said that \\"though it's hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler, Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations it's equally hard to dislike,\\" but criticized the finale \\"which might have been a bit more tense had we been able to take it remotely seriously.\\" Conversely, Time Out New Yorks David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying \\"one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off.\\" The New Yorker Anthony Lane criticized the plot, saying \\"toss everything you can find, starting with roughly diced plots, into the blender: such appears to be the method behind Tower Heist.\\" Lane called the characters \\"unlikable people\\" but offered praise to Broderick, saying he \\"underplays [the character] so well.\\" Lane lamented that \\"the notion of a theft from the thieves - from those who are lapped in lofty, screw you wealth - is a tempting one right now, but Tower Heist passes the buck.\\" Varietys Peter Debruge was also critical, saying the film \\"goes wonky on the way to the bank, due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy their paychecks ‚Äì namely, laughs.\\" Debruge felt that the opening 40 minutes were \\"a dull blue-collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes,\\" and while the film \\"picks up some much-needed momentum\\" with the actual heist, the \\"resolution feels rushed.\\" However, Debruge echoed praise for Murphy, calling his performance \\"a welcome return to the comic's irreverent, '80s-era persona,\\" and lamenting his limited screen-time. Video on demand boycott On October 5, 2011, Universal Pictures announced that Tower Heist would be made available for home viewing via parent company Comcast's video on demand system three weeks after its theatrical debut at the rental cost of $59.99. The move was announced as a test case, to be conducted only in Atlanta and Portland. The move met with criticism from cinema chains over concern that the test and any further future implementation would impact ticket sales. The following day, Cinemark Theatres - the third largest cinema chain in the United States - threatened to not show the film at all if Universal proceeded with the test. On October 11, 2011, several independent theater chains, including Galaxy Theatres, Regency Theatres and Emagine Theatres, and small cinema houses representing approximately 50 screens across the country, also threatened not to play Tower Heist. The following day the chains were joined by 950-screen National Amusements theater chain. In response, Universal Pictures released a statement saying that they would no longer pursue the proposed test. Accolades Tower Heist received two NAACP Image Award nominations, for Outstanding Motion Picture and Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for Murphy. Home media Tower Heist was released on DVD and Blu- ray Disc in the United States on February 21, 2012. The DVD and Blu-ray disc versions contain two alternate endings to the film, deleted and alternate scenes, a gag reel of mistakes made during filming, commentary on the film by Ratner, Griffin, Nathanson, and editor Mark Helfrich, and a behind the scenes film that details the development process of the film. The Blu-ray edition additionally contains film storyboards, three videos about the filmmaking process led by Ratner, and musical tracks from the film.

History The Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre (TNSTC) was established in 1983 and is functioning with the financial assistance of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The centre started its operations in 1988 with the setting up of Periyar Science and Technology Centre and the functioning of the Birla Planetarium. The centre functions under the chairmanship of the minister of education. The planetarium was inaugurated on 11 May 1988 by the then President of India R. Venkataraman. In April 2013, the state government upgraded the planetarium into a digital one at a cost of 10 crores. The 3D theatre in the complex was also upgraded. In April 2013, the Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre (TNSTC) announced its plan of setting up a 'Space Gallery' at a cost of 6 million in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The gallery showcases the development of space technology in India. There are plans to showcase models of satellite launch vehicle (SLV), polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV), and geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) in the gallery, in addition to a 10-m long scale-down model of SLV 1.6, kept in a horizontal position, to explain the first, second and third stage of a rocket. A mock-up control room will also be established to explain about how a rocket is launched into the space and the ways to observe the trajectory of the rocket. There are about 8 staff at the planetarium.Andre Heck (2004). StarGuides Plus: A World-Wide Directory of Organizations in Astronomy and Related Space Sciences (Developments in Hydrobiology), Springer The centre has branches in Coimbatore, Vellore and Trichy. Planetarium features The planetarium is equipped with a versatile opto-mechanical GOTO GM II starfield projector, an accompanying special-effects projector and an X-Y table system for simulating various celestial phenomena. The GM II projector has the provision to execute the diurnal, annual, latitudinal, and precessional motions. The pierced hemispherical inner dome of the planetarium, made of aluminium, is 15 m in diameter. The air-conditioned theatre has a seating capacity of 236. The total outlay proposed for the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002‚Äì2007) for the Periyar Science and Technology Centre and B. M. Birla Planetarium was 6.4 million, including 2.6 million for the X-Y table system at the planetarium. A rocket model at the Science Park In 2009, the planetarium established the 360-degree sky theatre, the first in India, with the installation of a full-dome mirror projection system with a DLP projector. The 360-degree effect is created with the help of Wrap, a special software that takes care of curvature correction. The projector was installed at a cost of 2.1 million. The planetarium building features a circumferential hall of fame around the main theatre with portraits and statues of scientists and photographs and models of various heavenly bodies, celestial phenomena and space missions. In 2009, the U.S. Consulate at Chennai donated portraits of Neil Armstrong, Sunita Williams and Kalpana Chawla for display in the hall of fame to commemorate increasing Indo-U.S. space ties. The planetarium also offers courses in astronomy and night-sky observations. There is a seminar hall and a classroom studio at the planetarium, where discussions and workshops are conducted by eminent personalities in the field of astronomy. The planetarium organises a special show on every second Saturday of month to view the night sky from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm. Under Part II Scheme for the year 2011‚Äì2012, the state government has sanctioned an amount of 1.5 million for the modernisation of the planetarium by providing six-segment multimedia projection system. Shows The planetarium conducts sky shows every day at different times in different languages. The shows include the Solar System, sky and seasons, eclipses, Earth, Man on Moon, comets, shooting meteoroids, stellar cycle and the deep sky. As of 2007, since its inception, the planetarium has introduced 35 programmes on these topics. Audio-visual programs on various aspects of astronomy and different cosmic phenomena are also shown. Program themes are changed every 3 months. Shows are conducted in English and Tamil. The planetarium and the Science and Technology Centre is open on all days except on national holidays from 10:00 am to 5:45 pm. The Science and Technology Centre, however, receives complaints on lack of maintenance of the scientific displays at the science park. Other exhibits=DRDO Pavilion In 2013, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) began setting up a DRDO pavilion on the planetarium campus in collaboration with Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre (TNSTC). The DRDO gallery will have a covered area of 5,000 sq ft built in the existing building, with additional open space made available for large life-size models and exhibits. The pavilion, being constructed at a cost of 8.5 million, is aimed to showcase the works undertaken by the DRDO in its 50 laboratories across the nation in the fields of aeronautics, electronics, armaments, engineering systems, instrumentation, missiles, combat vehicles, advanced computing and stimulation, naval systems, special materials, training, information systems, life sciences, and agriculture. The exhibit will showcase various models of gun, including the advanced machine guns and AK47s, historical developments of gun, construction of cut-section of gun, scale-down model of Brahmos 1.3, a supersonic cruise missile, Prithvi, a tactical surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missile, Agni, a family of medium to intercontinental range ballistic missiles, electronic equipments, electronic radars, electronic and communication systems, and life-supporting devices. It was also exhibit a model of a specialised clothing designed by DRDO, used by the Indian soldiers deployed at Siachen Glacier as protection against freezing temperatures. Renovation The planetarium was renovated beginning around May 2018 and was reopened after 18 months in November 2019. The mechanical projector was replaced by hybrid digital opto-mechanical projector that offers a 360-degree immersive video effect creating high-definition images of the simulated night sky and celestial objects. The decommissioned mechanical projector is named ‚ÄúThe Resting Giant‚Äù and has been kept on exhibit within the campus. The project which served the planetarium ever since its inception was a slide projector made in Japan that uses 35-mm film rolls. Its show has been viewed by an estimated 6 million visitors. The hybrid projector is capable of projecting the Sun, Moon, more than 18 bright stars, 12 zodiacal constellations, 26 constellations, Jovian planets and satellites and the rings and two satellites of the Saturn. The renovation also includes an increase in the seating capacity from 236 to 250. In 2019, a center established a new facility named ‚ÄúScience on a Sphere‚Äù (SOS), developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States, to serve as an educational tool to illustrate the Earth from various perspectives such as agriculture, forest, ocean temperature, and climate.

The main parties are the Liberal and National parties of the governing Coalition and the Australian Labor Party. Other minor political parties include the Greens, Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the One Nation, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Keep Sydney Open.. The New South Wales government is sometimes referred to informally as \\"the bear pit\\", as a mark of perceived unruly behaviour within the parliamentary chambers, and 'Macquarie Street', a metonym of the street of that name where Parliament House is located, in Sydney's CBD. State politics=Parliament of New South Wales The Australian state of New South Wales has a bicameral parliament. The Legislative Assembly (lower house) is composed of 93 members of parliament, each of whom represents a single electorate. The voting system is preferential. Until the mid-1990s, members of the Assembly served for up to four years, until the Greiner government made terms a fixed length of four years. The Legislative Council (upper house) comprises 42 members, who serve terms of 8 years. The Queen of Australia is represented by the governor, who formally appoints the premier, as nominated by the majority party in the Assembly. Office holders The formal chief executive of New South Wales is the governor, who is appointed as the Queen's representative on the advice of the head of the governing party. The current governor is Margaret Beazley. The governor holds limited reserve powers, but with few exceptions is required by convention to act on the advice of the government. The premier of New South Wales is currently The Hon. Gladys Berejiklian, of the Liberal Party. Berejiklian is the 45th Premier who assumed office on 23 January 2017 after the resignation of Mike Baird. This follows a succession of resignations as Baird succeeded Barry O'Farrell, who served as premier after a landslide election win at the 2011 election. O'Farrell was forced to resign following an unfortunate appearance at the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption. The Deputy Premier of New South Wales, currently Nationals leader is John Barilaro, MLA, who has held this office since 2016 succeeding Troy Grant who is now the Minister for Police and Minister for Emergency Services. Officially opposing the New South Wales government is the opposition, made up of the Labor Party, currently led by the leader of the opposition, Michael Daley. The government is decided every four years by election. The current election was held in 2019. Political parties New South Wales is currently governed by the Liberal Party. The two main parties are the Liberal Party/National Party Coalition, and the Labor Party. Other currently elected parties in New South Wales politics include the Greens, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Animal Justice Party, the One Nation, the Liberal Democrats and the Keep Sydney Open. State party support by region=Liberal The Liberals strongest base has always been on the North Shore and Northern Beaches as well as the Hills and Forest districts, creating a 'bloc' on the northern side of Sydney Harbour. The last time the Labor party won an electorate wholly within any of these districts was the electorates of Manly, Wakehurst and Willoughby in the 1978 'Wranslide' election. The electoral districts of North Shore and the single Liberal held electorate of Vaucluse in the Eastern Suburbs are the most affluent areas in the state and have never been lost to the Labor party. The Liberals have consistently held the regional electorates of Albury, Bega and Wagga Wagga. Nationals The Nationals (formally the Country Party) are a party representing country issues and farmers and only generally seek to represent rural and regional electorates. Their strongest base within the state has always been the New England, Northern Tablelands, Northern Rivers, Mid North Coast, Riverina and the Central West. The Nationals biggest competitors are the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers and well as local independents from time to time. When there is no incumbent, it is not uncommon for the Liberals to run candidates against the Nationals creating three cornered contests in semi-rural electorates such as Cessnock, Monaro, Golbourn and Wagga Wagga. Labor Labor was traditionally strongest in the Inner West, Western Sydney and South Western Sydney however their status has diminished since the late 2000s in the Inner West with the rise of the left- wing Greens in the electorates of Balmain and Newtown. The continued success of the Liberals in Western Sydney has seen Labor unable to recover over the last decade electorates for which they normally held uninterrupted for multiple electoral cycles including Penrith, East Hills and Parramatta. Labor's significant majorities and continual hold-outs with its highest two- party preferred votes are in the electorates with the highest concentration of lower socioeconomic groups such as Mount Druitt, Blacktown and Canterbury. Labor are equally unchallenged in the electorates with known ethnic enclaves such as Lakemba, Cabramatta, Bankstown and Fairfield respectively. Outside metropolitan Sydney, Labor have consistently recorded majorities in the regions of the Hunter and Central Coast with the Coalition holding only a single electorate in each without interruption, being: Upper Hunter and Terrigal. Labor generally perform well in the Illawarra and in the Far West mining town of Broken Hill. Greens The Greens have solidified support within the Inner West city region of metropolitan Sydney at the expense of Labor. There has been little to no opposition from the Liberals or their predecessors in seats where left-wing candidates have always won by substantial margins such as the current Balmain and Newtown and the former related seats such as Leichhardt, Phillip, Elizabeth, Rozelle and Port Jackson. With the loss of these reliable seats, this creates a harder task for Labor to form majority government into the future. The Greens have seen localised success in the Northern Rivers seat of Ballina which entirely encompasses the Byron Bay district. 'Blue Ribbon' and 'Hard Labor' electorates The following lists current electorates where the opposing party (Liberal/National versus Labor/Greens) have never won each seat or its direct predecessor following a redistribution or since the abolition of proportional representation of the lower house in 1927: Labor/Greens * Aurburn * Balmain * Bankstown * Canterbury * Fairfield * Lakemba * Liverpool * Mount Druitt * Newtown * Shellharbour * Summer Hill * Wallsend * Wollongong Liberal * Baulkham Hills * Castle Hill * Davidson * Epping * Hornsby * Ku-ring-gai * North Shore * Pittwater * Terrigal * Vaucluse Nationals * Clarence * Coffs Harbour * Oxley * Port Macquarie * Tamworth * Upper Hunter Note: Labor and Greens have been grouped together as it is historically evident that the electorates of Newtown and Balmain would likely never be won by a centre-right candidate and were held by the Labor party for nearly 80 years. Marginal seats For governments to change hands, generally there is a quantity of marginal electorates that determine the result of the election which sustain the most attention from the major parties. In New South Wales, most of these electorates are located in Western Sydney and surrounds and generally after redistribution by the New South Wales Electoral Commission they remain marginal or ¬± 5% of the previous margin. In the case of electorates that more than often side with the incoming or continuing government, known as a bellwether, the electorate of Monaro holds the record for all but one (1995) election since 1927 in having sided with the government of the day, the other common bellwethers being Oatley (formerly Georges River) and Ryde (formerly Gladesville and Fuller). Other electorates that often change hands between the major parties include: Drummoyne, Gosford, Maitland, Heathcote, Holsworthy and Wollondilly. Federal politics New South Wales has 48 seats in the Australian House of Representatives, the most of any state. As such, it is nearly impossible to win government without a strong base in New South Wales, while a decent showing in New South Wales can usually make up for a poor night elsewhere. Labor has never won an election without winning a majority in New South Wales, while the Liberal-National Coalition last won an election without a majority in New South Wales in 1961.Green, Antony 2016 federal election preview in New South Wales. ABC News, 2016 The 1996 federal election was an example of how critical New South Wales is in federal elections. The Labor government only suffered a five percent swing to the Coalition nationwide, which is not normally enough in and of itself to cause a change of government. However, the election turned into a Coalition rout in large part due to Labor losing 13 of its 33 seats in New South Wales. Party support by regionLiberals As with the state Liberal strongholds, the federal results are similar in that the party draws most of its continuous support from the North Shore of Sydney Harbour to the Hawkesbury River. The Liberal Party of Australia have never lost the divisions of Berowra, Bradfield, Makellar, North Sydney and Warringah on the northern side of the harbour or the Eastern Suburbs division of Wentworth on the southern side to an opposing center-left or left-wing party endorsed candidate. Two of the safest divisions for the Liberals are Bradfield and the Hills district based division of Mitchell. Labor Unlike with state results, Labor has consistently maintained supremacy over the Greens in the Inner West and the Liberals through the bulk of the Western Sydney basin to the Blue Mountains. The only inner-metropolitan Sydney seat that changes between Labor and Liberal is the division of Reid (formerly Lowe) which is currently held by the Liberals as of 2013. Labor dominate the Hunter and Illawarra regions, as of 2019 holding every seat; the divisions of Gilmore and Paterson being the only historically winnable seats for the Liberals in each region. The Central Coast seats of Dobell and Division of Robertson swing between both parties.

The church was established in July 2005. It is the latest church completed in the Diocese of Penang and also a Christian Community Centre. History The Catholic population in the southern Penang Island was increasing fast. In 1989, H. R. Watts, a parishioner of Holy Spirit Cathedral donated a piece of land to the diocese. He wished to build a Christian Community Centre, to promote ecumenism. In 1996, there was a meeting between Bishop Antony Selvanayagam, the Bishop of Penang, and Major and Mrs Barton (daughter of Mr Watts) as representatives of the land owner. At this meeting Mrs Barton reiterated her father's wish that the land which was donated unconditionally was to be owned and managed by the Roman Catholic Church as a Christian facility. The then parish priest has also proposed a building plans but things did not go on well. In 2002, Msgr Stephen Liew, a former parish priest, formed a building committee under the advice of bishop. The site plan was submitted in 2004 and building plan in May 2005. In November 2004, the cathedral held a poll and listed a few names to decide an appropriate name for the church. The name 'Divine Mercy was chosen by most parishioners, and therefore the church was named after Divine Mercy. The Church of Divine Mercy was officially launched and established in July 2005 by former parish priests, Fr. Francis Anthony and Fr. Henry Rajoo. In total, the church and Christian Community Centre costed RM 8,000,000. Many fundraising drives were held, including a lucky draw, food carnival, a grand dinner and various coffee mornings. Parishioners too donated much money, outstationers also contributed a lot. On 28 November 2007, the groundbreaking ceremony was held, with Bishop Antony Selvanayagam and former parish priests Fr. Francis Anthony and Fr. Henry Rajoo in attendance. On 15 March 2010, the topping up ceremony was held with a mass. In July 2010, the church was finally completed. The church was the first in 41 years to be constructed with the previous churches being constructed in 1969 (Holy Spirit Cathedral and Risen Christ Church). Masses started on 22 August 2010 at the completed church building. On 29 September 2010, Bishop Antony Selvanayagam officiate the opening of the church. Also present were the former parish priests Fr. Francis Anthony, Fr. Henry Rajoo and 8 other priests from Penang Island. About 1,500 Catholics gather for the opening ceremony, which was much anticipated by the people. On 29 September 2013, on its 3rd anniversary, the Church of Divine Mercy was officially elevated to parish status with Fr. Martin Arlando being the first parish priest. In 2015, the church erected a baptismal pool together with a reliquarium. The reliquarium now houses the sacred relics of Catholics saints, Faustina Kowalska and John Paul II. The Church of Divine Mercy is the first church in Malaysia to have obtained the relic of John Paul II. Current status Currently, the Church of Divine Mercy caters to about 2,500 Catholics residing in the Bayan Lepas area. The church capacity is 900 people. The Christian Community Centre has a hall, meeting rooms and classrooms to cater for talks and sessions and also a priests residence. Currently the parish priest is Rev Fr. Martin Arlando.

The Lorenz curve is used to describe the inequality in the distribution of a quantity (usually income or wealth in economics, or size or reproductive output in ecology). The most common summary statistic for the Lorenz curve is the Gini coefficient, which is an overall measure of inequality within the population. The Lorenz asymmetry coefficient can be a useful supplement to the Gini coefficient. The Lorenz asymmetry coefficient is defined as :S = F(\\\\mu)+ L(\\\\mu) where the functions F and L are defined as for the Lorenz curve, and Œº is the mean. If S > 1, then the point where the Lorenz curve is parallel with the line of equality is above the axis of symmetry. Correspondingly, if S < 1, then the point where the Lorenz curve is parallel to the line of equality is below the axis of symmetry. If data arise from the log-normal distribution, then S = 1, i.e., the Lorenz curve is symmetric.Damgaard & Weiner (2000) The sample statistic S can be calculated from n ordered size data, (x_1, ..., x_m,x_{m+1},..., x_n) , using the following equations: :\\\\delta=\\\\frac{\\\\mu - x_m}{x_{m+1} - x_m} :F(\\\\mu)=\\\\frac{m + \\\\delta}{n} :L(\\\\mu)=\\\\frac{L_m + \\\\delta x_{m+1}}{L_n}, where m is the number of individuals with a size or wealth less than Œº and L_i=\\\\sum_{j=1}^i x_j. However, if one or more of the data size is equal to Œº, then S has to defined as an interval instead of a number (see #LAC interval when some data is equal to Œº). The Lorenz asymmetry coefficient characterizes an important aspect of the shape of a Lorenz curve. It tells which size or wealth classes contribute most to the population‚Äôs total inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient. If the LAC is less than 1, the inequality is primarily due to the relatively many small or poor individuals. If the LAC is greater than 1, the inequality is primarily due to the few largest or wealthiest individuals. For incomes distributed according to a log-normal distribution, the LAC is identically 1. LAC interval when some data is equal to Œº The above formulas assume that none of the data values are equal to Œº; strictly speaking we assume that data sizes are continuously distributed, so that P(x_i = \\\\mu) \\\\approx 0. Otherwise, if one or more of x_i = \\\\mu, then a section of the Lorenz curve is parallel to the diagonal, and S has to be defined as an interval instead of a number. The interval can be defined as follows: \\\\left [ \\\\frac{m}{n} + \\\\frac{L_m}{L_n}, \\\\frac{m+a}{n} + \\\\frac{L_{m+a}}{n} \\\\right ] where a is the number of data values that are equal to Œº.

Her career was cut short when she was murdered by conductor Aloys Obrist. Prior to her death, she had broken off a romantic relationship with Obrist and become involved with the bass-baritone Albin Swoboda, Jr. who was just 17 years old at the time. Unusual for an unmarried woman at that time she gave birth to a daughter in 1900 (from Hans Freiherr von Entress-F√ºrsteneck) and to a son in 1902 (from Hugo Reichenberger). During her career she also performed as a guest artist at the Bavarian State Opera, the Berlin State Opera, and the Frankfurt Opera among others.

History  The terminal of Riga‚ÄìJelgava Railway, was opened in 1868 and called Riga-Mitauer Bahnhof back then. This was a very important station, which secured the connection of Riga with Zemgale, but in 1872 one year after construction of the railway bridge across the Daugava, it lost its significance and was renamed Riga III, and later Riga III Commodity Station, which was part of the joint Tor≈Üakalns station. The Jelgava station was located north of the present Tor≈Üakalns station between Uzvaras Boulevard and Akme≈Üu Street. Nowadays the old station building is partly preserved at Akme≈Üu street 19 (the former address - Akme≈Üu iela 38) as a dwelling house. In 1877, trains running along the new line Riga-Tukums line began to stop in Tor≈Üakalns. The present station building was built in the middle of the 1980s. In 1950, after the electrification of the Riga-Dubulti railway section, electric trains began to stop in Tornakalns. In December 1972, the Riga- Jelgava line was electrified and the electric trains in that direction was in service as well. By August 15, 2001, the diesel train Riga-Liepaja was decommissioned.

The village is just off the A361 road about south-west of Lechlade in Gloucestershire. Most of the population lives in the hamlet of Upper Inglesham, which is on the main road about south of the village. The parish forms the extreme north-east corner of the Borough of Swindon and County of Wiltshire, and is bounded to the west and north by the River Thames (which also forms the county boundary with Gloucestershire), and to the east by the county boundary with Oxfordshire (Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes). The River Cole forms part of the eastern boundary. As the parish's population is small it has a parish meeting instead of a parish council. Inglesham's Roundhouse are often used by boaters as a navigation point to denote the westernmost point most cabin cruisers and narrowboats can travel along the Thames, as beyond Inglesham the river becomes too clogged with vegetation and too shallow to effectively navigate.

He was the post-war generation's most important expert in the study of Greek coins and medals and would become Keeper of Coins and Medals at the British Museum in 1965.'A Shining Light', A history of Bloxham School (Simon Batten, 2010), p.49 Jenkins was born in Bristol, England and educated at Bloxham School and Oxford University. Jenkins's introduction to numismatics came during his time at Oxford, while he was studying Classics at Corpus Christi in the late 1930s. He attended the Heberden Coin Room in the Ashmolean Museum and was introduced to the subject under the guidance of Edward Robinson and Humphrey Sutherland. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served as an officer in the Royal Artillery, from 1944 to 1946 flying as a reconnaissance pilot in South East Asia. He returned to Oxford to graduate in 1946, before starting work at the British Museum. Shortly after arriving at the museum, Jenkins met and became friends with a young Indian scholar, A.K. Narain, who was studying at the School of Oriental and African Studies, writing his doctoral thesis on the coins of the ancient Greek kingdoms in the territories of modern Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. It was Jenkins‚Äô involvement in this work that would lead to him eventually becoming Keeper of Coins and Medals at the museum in 1965. During Jenkins's first decade in the British Museum he rapidly built his own expertise and reputation, developing the collection through new acquisitions which he regularly reported in the British Museum Quarterly, so that by 1956 he was promoted to the post of Deputy Keeper. In his second decade he shifted his focus to the western edges of the Greek world to focus on the ancient coinages of Sicily, North Africa and Spain. In 1957 he published a study of a hoard of Carthaginian coins found in southern France. This piece of research revealed to him the poverty of scholarship on this important ancient region. He was introduced to the Celtic coinages of Spain by George Miles, doyen of oriental coinage at the American Numismatic Society (New York). After shorter articles on this topic, he undertook a huge research project on the precious metal coinages of Carthage (working with R.B. Lewis), which set out to create a firm chronology and system for Carthage's coinage. He was awarded the medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1975. He married Cynthia Scott in 1939 and together they had one son and two daughters. He died in Richmond upon Thames, Surrey in 2005 at the age of 86.

Early life Fitzroy was born in Norfolk, England, in 1844. His father was the Reverend Frederick Thomas William Coke Fitzroy (1808‚Äì1862) and his mother was Emilia Le-Strange Styleman. His grandfather was Lt.-Gen. William FitzRoy (1773‚Äì1837), and his great-grandfather was Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton (1737‚Äì1797). He was a distant nephew of Robert FitzRoy, the 2nd Governor of New Zealand, whose grandfather Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton was the elder brother of the 1st Baron Southampton. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge. Canterbury He emigrated to Australia in 1867 and came to New Zealand soon after, where he was initially a cadet at Mesopotamia Station (previously owned by Samuel Butler) and then settled in Heslerton, Canterbury; the main farm is now known as Northbank homestead, located north of the Rakaia River. In total he spent 12 years in Canterbury. The dominant topic for the 1875 election was the abolition of the Provinces. William Reeves, the incumbent, favoured the retention of the provincial system of government, whilst Fitzroy was an abolitionist. Fitzroy narrowly won the election in the Selwyn electorate by 14 votes. He represented the Selwyn electorate for one parliamentary term until 1879, when he retired because he had moved to Hastings. Hawke's Bay He married Susannah Beetham, the daughter of the portrait painter William Beetham, on 21 February 1878 at St James Church in Lower Hutt; his wife had grown up in Lower Hutt. He thus became brother-in-law with George Beetham, who represented the electorate at the same time that he represented Selwyn. He moved to Hastings in Hawke's Bay, where he was involved in local politics before becoming mayor from 1894 to 1899. During his mayoralty, a system of surface drainage was undertaken. He was only opposed once for the mayoralty. He was also on the Hawkes Bay Education Board and the local A & P Association. He was secretary of the Hawkes Bay Club and served for 20 years on the Hawkes Bay Acclimatisation society. He had a seat on the Hospital Board. In the and s, he contested the electorate and came second after the incumbent, James Carroll. He later moved to Havelock North, where he died. He was survived by his wife.

The excavation was directed by French archaeologist Claude Albore Livadie, who described the settlement as the \\"first Pompeii\\". Discovery thumbnail The discovery of two bodies which had been caught by the Pyroclastic flow as they were fleeing a Volcanic eruption from Mount Vesuvius led archaeologists to find the lost settlement. The eruption, which took place in the 2nd millennium BC, covered the village in volcanic ash. The remains of livestock such as goats were found, and various fossils were also found as mud had flowed into the structures and preserved various foodstuffs and plants. Findings Of the entire settlement only three structures remained intact after the eruption. No human remains have been found in the settlement leading archaeologists to believe the populace had escaped, although not all had made it to safety. The lack of personal belongings in the settlement also lead to the belief that the people were given enough time to gather their most precious belongings before leaving.

Young archaeologist Jack Hunter planned only to take a picture of a cuneiform tablet from once unsurpassed Mesopotamian metropolis Ugarit in present Syria, but is caught and has to steal it from a private museum in France. He refuses to join his mentor, professor Frederic \\"Freddie\\" Shaffer, who believes the poem is a coded treasure map, on a relic hunt, until his friend is murdered to steal it. The obvious suspect is Syrian artifact trader Ali, so Jack flies to Damascus. There he must accept working with local, US-educated colleague Nadia and her driver Tariq. Their lives are threatened during the long relic quest, for one by common nemesis Albert Littman, but another secret lurks too. Part 2: Akhenaten, a pharaoh who raided Ugarit, stole its treasure and the second piece of the Star of Heaven. If Jack and his team find the tomb, they will find the treasure and the Star. Loads of action and mystery await. Part 3: The final piece of the puzzle and final film in the film series. It seems the Romans got to Akhenaten's Tomb first. The race is on to see if Jack and his friends can find the treasure and recover the Iris back from Littmann and the Russians.

Education Andrew Lumsden attended Kingswood School in Bath, Somerset (as Andrew Sita-Lumsden) and graduated from St. Catharine's College, Cambridge with Double First Class Honours in Natural Sciences. After visiting Yale University for two years as a Fulbright Scholar, he returned to England to complete his PhD in Developmental Biology at the University of London. Career and research Lumsden has held various lectureships at Guy‚Äôs Hospital Medical School and the United Medical Schools of Guy‚Äôs and St. Thomas‚Äô Hospital before being made a full Professor of the University of London in 1989. He has been an International Scholar of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (1993‚Äì1998) and a Miller Institute visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1994). Lumsden has served on the Medical Research Council Neurosciences and Mental Health Board and Grants Committee (1992‚Äî1998), the Wellcome Trust Neuroscience Funding Committee (1997‚Äî2000), and the Brain Functions Grant Review Committee of the Human Frontier Science Program (1998‚Äî2001). He has also served as editor of Development (1995‚Äî2007) and is co-founder of the on-line, open-access journal Neural Development. In addition, Andrew Lumsden is a co-Head of Section for Faculty of 1000. Andrew Lumsden has co-authored a book entitled The Developing Brain with Michael Brown and Roger Keynes. Following his PhD on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in mammalian development, Lumsden‚Äôs interest moved to the question of how integumental structures, such as teeth and vibrissae acquire their nerve supply, and how the cranial neural crest contributes to their patterning. Studies on the development of the trigeminal nerve and ganglion led on to observations of the organisation of their corresponding motor and sensory regions of the central nervous system. His seminal observations and experiments on the developing hindbrain of mammal and bird embryos confirmed the long suggested but never agreed view that this brain region has a rigidly segmented organisation, much like the body plan of insects and worms. To assist his research, he developed the Lumsden BioScissors‚Ñ¢. Most recently, he has focussed on the developing forebrain, where he discovered signalling properties in a small set of cells that pattern the large surrounding region of the thalamus.  Awards and honours Lumsden was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (elected 1994), a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1998), and a Fellow of King's College London (1999). He was also elected an EMBO Member in 2008. In 2001, he was awarded The Ferrier Lecture and medal by the Royal Society and in 2007, the W. Maxwell Cowan Prize for \\"outstanding contributions in developmental neuroscience\\".

It was developed as part of a Ph.D thesis by Dr. Ir. Linda van den Bedem and is the first surgical robot to incorporate force feedback. Background The Sofie surgical robot was developed as part of the Ph.D work of ir. Linda van den Bedem on the improvement of existing surgical systems. The surgical systems commercially available as of September 2010 (such as the da Vinci Surgical System) all focus on translating movements made by a surgeon at a surgical console into movements by robot arms. However, a great limitation of this generation of robots is a complete lack of any tactile feedback: the surgeon cannot feel what he is doing, so he must rely completely on visual feedback to check his incisions, sutures and so on. A secondary drawback to this generation of robot is the average size and bulkiness, limiting the movements of surgical staff around the table and necessitating time-consuming recalibrations whenever the patient must be moved. The Sofie robot improves upon the design of the previous generation of surgical robots by adding force feedback to the surgeon's controls, restoring the use of tactile senses that surgeons learn to use in their training. Design Like several of the previous generations of surgical robot, Sofie is a master-slave design. The two components (master and slave) are completely separated from each other, however, with all communication between the two taking place over data cables arranged in an overhead wiring boom. The master The master, or control console, is a workstation from which the surgeon controls the robotic arms and surgical tools. The workstation consists of a monitor on which an image of the work area is shown, plus a number of force-feedback joysticks. The console was designed to be a separate module from the slave, which allows it to be placed at some distance from the surgical table; this means that personnel working at the table will not be hampered in their movement by a large control console in the vicinity of the table. The master console was developed by ir. Ron Hendrix. The slave The slave (the actual subject of dr.ir. Van den Bedem's thesis) is a robotic arm frame which can accommodate three independent manipulators (two for surgical tools, one for a camera). The frame for the manipulators is of the type used for pick-and-place robots, allowing the manipulators full freedom of motion in space. This means that the surgeon can also choose the optimal direction of approach for any organ, rather than having to move the patient to suit the machine. Of course the manipulators also provide force feedback through the overhead cable boom. In addition to having a large degree of freedom, the Sofie slave is also quite compact when compared to the generation of surgical robots in current use. Whereas the current generation requires a large robot arm installation next to the surgical table, the slave is small enough to be clamped onto the surgical bed itself. This means that the slave moves with the bed when the surgical table is moved or adjusted and doesn't have to be adjusted separately for the new position of the table in the operating room. Commercial advantages and exploitation Another advantage to the design of Sofie is that its construction is cheaper than that of the previous generation of robot. Although there is no notion yet of what a Sofie-like robot would cost in a commercial offering, it is already clear that the design allows for a robot that costs substantially less than the ‚Ç¨1,000,000 average of the da Vinci Surgical System. As of October 2010, dr.ir. Van den Bedem is investigating the possibilities for commercial exploitation of the basic design. The expectation however, is that any robot could only be available in the market by 2016 at the earliest.
