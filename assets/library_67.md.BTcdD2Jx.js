A quiet and reserved man, he forms an attachment to the younger of the Dashwood sisters, Marianne. Background The younger son of a landed family in Dorsetshire, Brandon made a career in the army, until at the death of his brother he inherited Delaford. We are told that at that point the estate was encumbered, but it appears that at the time of the book's action they had all been resolved: “His property here, his place, his house, - everything in such respectable and excellent condition!”.Jane Austen, Sense and Sensibility (London 1932) p. 61 and p. 337 Character In terms of activities and life experience, Colonel Brandon is perhaps the most Byronic among Austen's leading men.R. Jenkyns, A Fine Brush of Ivory (Oxford 2007) p. 188 He attempts to elope with his teenage cousin Eliza for whom he has a passionate attachment; he has the mortification of seeing her married for mercenary reasons to his elder brother; he serves his country abroad and returns to rescue the dying Eliza from a debtors' prison; he raises her illegitimate daughter, only to have to fight a duel with her seducer; and he forms a second, passionate attachment to another vibrant seventeen-year-old girl, Marianne.R. Jenkyns, A Fine Brush of ivory (Oxford 2007) p. 188 His very name links him to the rake in Richardson's Pamela – Mr B. of Brandon Hall – and his experiences are in many ways a benign retelling (rescuer, not seducer) of the latter's life.J. Harris, Jane Austen's Art of Memory (2003) p. 37 and 49 In social life and in courtship, the Colonel may be considered an uninteresting character. Unlike the traditional romantic suitor, the Colonel is melancholy, taciturn, he cancels expeditions, intrudes at inconvenient moments, speaks only to Elinor and not to Marianne.G. B. Stern Talking of Jane Austen (London 1946) p. 139-144 He is set up in opposition to John Willoughby – the latter having all the romantic trappings, discourse, and marries for money; while the outwardly dull Colonel marries for love.E. Auerbach, Searching for Jane Austen (2004) p. 113 Despite this, critical dissatisfaction with the starkness of the typology, and with the book's outcome, is pervasive.R. Jenkyns, A Fine Brush of Ivory (Oxford 2007) p. 191-2 The Colonel seemed to lack appeal to the 20th-century reader, making his eventual success in wooing seem unlikely.G. B. Stern Talking of Jane Austen (London 1946) p. 144-5 For a figure closer to Jane Austen's time like Henry Austin Dobson, however, the marriage was a mark of her realism: “Every one does not get a Bingley or a Darcy (with a park); but...not a few enthusiasts like Marianne decline at last upon middle-aged colonels with flannel waistcoats”.A. Dobson, 'Introduction', Jane Austen, Sense and Sensibility (London 1932 [1895]) p. xii Some scholars have seen parallels between Colonel Brandon and Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of India. Hastings had been rumoured to be the biological father of Eliza de Feuillide, who was Jane Austen's cousin. Linda Robinson Walker argues that Hastings \\"haunts Sense and Sensibility in the character of Colonel Brandon\\": both left for India at age seventeen; both may have had illegitimate daughters named Eliza; both participated in a duel.

Once a significant and independent estate, it was bought by the Duboscq family of Château Haut-Marbuzet in 1988 and the brand has since then been used to label the second wine of their production.Suckling, James, Wine Spectator (March 31, 2007). \\"50 Best Bordeaux under $50\\", p. 81Kissack, Chris, thewinedoctor.com Chateau Haut-Marbuzet  History  The estate was named after Dennis MacCarthy (1719–1796), a member of the eldest branch of clan MacCarthy-Diarmuid-Reagh, formerly established at Cloghan Castel, county Cork, Ireland. It is believed that the MacCarthys were Jacobite Catholics who followed King James II Stuart to France in 1692, after his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne. Among other noble Irishmen, like the Lynchs, the Clarkes and the Dillons, Dennis MacCarthy settled near Bordeaux, an active French port of the time, where he established his family. Applied to Bordeaux, the broader movement of Irish exiles to Continental Europe known as Flight of the Wild Geese is called the \\"Flight of the Wine Geese\\" as many of them left traces in the Médoc wine industry by creating estates which bore their names. In Bordeaux, their fortunes prospered. Dennis MacCarthy became a prominent citizen, director of the Chamber of Commerce in 1767, then Premier Consul of the city in 1767-1768. His nephews John and Donald MacCarthy founded MacCarthy Frères a négociant company specialized in shipping wines to the British Isles and Scandinavia. A rue MacCarthy in Bordeaux-Caudéran commemorates their ascension. In 1815, all the vines of Marbuzet formed part of MacCarthy estate. In 1854, they were forced to divide up the estate and sell it to the Raymond family.Coates, Clive (1995). Grands Vins. University of California Press. p. 210.

World War I Beales was the son of Alderman W. S. Beales. The younger Beales joined the Royal Flying Corps as a despatch rider in December 1914 and earned the 1914-1915 Star. Beales then switched roles to that of observer/gunner in the Bristol F.2 Fighters of 48 Squadron, which was operating on the Western Front. He scored his first aerial victory on 21 March 1918, destroying a German Pfalz D.III while piloted by William Lewis Wells. Two days later, the crew of Beales and Wells destroyed an LVG reconnaissance plane in the morning, and another LVG and a Pfalz D.III in the evening. On 28 March, Corporal Beales was wounded in the hand while in a dogfight with a German fighter; though Beales claimed he drove down the fighter out of control, the win went unverified. Beales brought down his fifth victim, an Albatros D.V, out of control on 1 April. On the 25th, flying with Charles Napier as his pilot, Beales destroyed a Rumpler. On 9 May, in a ten-minute dogfight, Beales and Napier drove down two Fokker Dr.I triplanes and a Pfalz D.III; in turn, they were brought down, probably by Germans from Jasta 46, but survived. Beales final tally was five German aeroplanes shot down and destroyed, four driven down out of control. For his efforts, Beales was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal in April; it would be gazetted on 26 June 1918. Post World War I Beales became a mortician at Weelsby Grove, Grimsby postwar. A Walter Beales was the licensee of the Victoria Arms public house in North Creake, Norfolk from 1922 to 1937. In World War II, he would accept a commission in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and command a gliding school. He would later command his local Air Training Corps unit. He gave up his commission as a flying officer in the RAFVR on 1 May 1951. Honours and awards ;Distinguished Conduct Medal :2565 Corporal W. Beales, RAF. (Grimsby). :For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Whilst returning alone from a reconnaissance he was attacked by three enemy machines. Though he was wounded in the hand he drove down one of them out of control, and drove off the others in a running fight lasting ten minutes. On a later occasion he ably assisted his pilot in bringing down two enemy machines, one of which went down in flames.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was vested in the Trust on 1 July 1988. The church is all that remains of Tarrant Abbey, for which it may have been a lay church. The Abbey was founded in the 13th century by Ralph de Kahaines (of nearby Tarrant Keyneston) as a Cistercian nunnery. The flint chancel, dates from the 12th century, with the nave, tower and porch being built in the 14th century. The 15th-century tower houses three bells, two of them medieval and one 17th century. The nave roof added in the early 16th century. In 1911 a major restoration of the church was undertaken. Murals The interior includes several coffin lids from the 13th century. These have been moved from the Abbey and may relate to two of the famous people associated with it. The first is Queen Joan, the wife of Alexander II of Scotland and daughter of King John of England (Richard I's brother and successor) who is buried in the grave yard (supposedly in a golden coffin). The second is Bishop Richard Poore, builder of Salisbury Cathedral, who was baptised in the abbey church and later (in 1237) buried in the abbey, which he founded. He was at one time Dean of the old cathedral at Old Sarum, and later became bishop of first Chichester, then Salisbury and finally Durham. There are also 15th century stained glass, a font from the 16th century and an octagonal pulpit pews with moulded panelling from the 17th century. Mediaeval wall paintings cover most of the walls of the nave and chancel, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries. One set of pictures depicts the acts of St Margaret of Antioch. The Annunciation dates from the 14th century and shows the winged figure of Gabriel and the virgin. The south wall has two rows of paintings one above the other. The lower set show three kings or princes, and three skeletons, which are believed to represent \\"the emptiness of earthly rank and riches\\". Attendance at the church fell after World War II and it was declared redundant becoming the responsibility of the Churches Conservation Trust in 1988. £100,000 was spent on masonry repairs and make it weather-proof. Another £68,000 was spent between 2003 and 2007 to improve the drainage, eradicate death watch beetle and stabilise and re-roof the tower.

Earth's shadow (or Earth shadow) is the shadow that Earth itself casts through its atmosphere and into outer space, toward the antisolar point. During the twilight period (both early dusk and late dawn), the shadow's visible fringe – sometimes called the dark segment or twilight wedgehttp://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=optics&subcat;=twilight_wedge – appears as a dark and diffuse band just above the horizon, most distinct when the sky is clear. Since Earth's diameter is 3.7 times the Moon's, the length of the planet's umbra is correspondingly 3.7 times that of the lunar umbra: roughly . Appearance Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus at dusk, looking east from the Marin Headlands just north of San Francisco in October 2010. Earth's shadow cast onto the atmosphere can be viewed during the \\"civil\\" stage of twilight, assuming the sky is clear and the horizon is relatively unobstructed. The shadow's fringe appears as a dark bluish to purplish band that stretches over 180° of the horizon opposite the Sun, i.e. in the eastern sky at dusk and in the western sky at dawn. Before sunrise, Earth's shadow appears to recede as the Sun rises; after sunset, the shadow appears to rise as the Sun sets. Earth's shadow is best seen when the horizon is low, such as over the sea, and when the sky conditions are clear. In addition, the higher the observer's elevation is to view the horizon, the sharper the shadow appears. Belt of Venus Full moon rising, as seen through the Belt of Venus. A very small part of the Earth's shadow (dark blue) is also visible in this image, but the horizon here is too high for more of the Earth's shadow to be seen. A related phenomenon in the same part of the sky is the Belt of Venus, or anti-twilight arch, a pinkish band visible above the bluish shade of Earth's shadow, named after the planet Venus which, when visible, is typically located in this region of the sky. No defined line divides the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus; one colored band blends into the other in the sky. The Belt of Venus is quite a different phenomenon from the afterglow, which appears in the geometrically opposite part of the sky. Color When the Sun is near the horizon around sunset or sunrise, the sunlight appears reddish. This is because the light rays are penetrating an especially thick layer of the atmosphere, which works as a filter, scattering all but the longer (redder) wavelengths. From the observer's perspective, the red sunlight directly illuminates small particles in the lower atmosphere in the sky opposite of the Sun. The red light is backscattered to the observer, which is the reason why the Belt of Venus appears pink. The lower the setting Sun descends, the less defined the boundary between Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus appears. This is because the setting Sun now illuminates a thinner part of the upper atmosphere. There the red light is not scattered because fewer particles are present, and the eye only sees the \\"normal\\" (usual) blue sky, which is due to Rayleigh scattering from air molecules. Eventually, both Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus dissolve into the darkness of the night sky. Color of lunar eclipses A total lunar eclipse on December 21, 2010, shows the reddish light falling on the Moon's surface. Earth's shadow is as curved as the planet is, and its umbra extends into outer space. (The antumbra, however, extends indefinitely.) When the Sun, Earth, and the Moon are aligned perfectly (or nearly so), with Earth between the Sun and the Moon, Earth's shadow falls onto the lunar surface facing the night side of the planet, such that the shadow gradually darkens the full Moon, causing a lunar eclipse. Even during a total lunar eclipse, a small amount of sunlight however still reaches the Moon. This indirect sunlight has been refracted as it passed through Earth's atmosphere. The air molecules and particulates in Earth's atmosphere scatter the shorter wavelengths of this sunlight; thus, the longer wavelengths of reddish light reaches the Moon, in the same way that light at sunset or sunrise appears reddish. This weak red illumination gives the eclipsed Moon a dimly reddish or copper color.

History  Backstage pass for the Craven and Camrose events. The event was first held in 1983 as the Big Valley Jamboree, with Roy Orbison as a headline act. The event was originally founded by Roman Catholic priest Lucien Larré as a fundraiser for his youth housing charity Bosco Homes. A historic feature of the festival has been the \\"Gopher Run\\", a rush seating line where up to 3,000 spectators can bring their own chairs for the front row. In the late-1980's, the Jamboree came under government oversight due to an abuse scandal involving Larré. In 1993, the Jamboree was sold to the Alberta-based Vinco Foods, who began to hold a sister event in Camrose, Alberta. By then, the event had begun to see declines in ticket sales and revenue, leading to changes such as a cap on ticket sales, and replacement of the \\"Gopher Run\\" with reserved \\"VIP\\" seats in 1995. A more raucous atmosphere also began to develop at the Jamboree (in comparison to its roots as a family- oriented event), to the point that the Ministry of Health distributed free condoms at it in 1993, a Regina-based company organized a strip show at the local curling rink in 1994, and an attendee in 1995 was quoted as saying she was in search of \\"fast horses, faster men and more beer\\". After going into receivership, the Big Valley Jamboree was sold to the Queen City Kinsmen in February 1996, who ran the festival with a \\"back to the basics\\" approach with less commercialization. Unable to return the event to profitability, the Kinsmen relaunched the Jamboree as a classic rock festival in 2000, known as Rock 'N The Valley. In 2005, promoter Troy Vollhoffer (who had previously worked as a stagehand for early editions of the event) took over the festival, and relaunched it with a return to country music as the Craven Country Jamboree. The Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose has continued to be held. On October 27, 2016, it was announced that the event had been rebranded as part of the Country Thunder series of festivals (which are run by Vollhoffer via his company Premier Global Productions), with organizers stating that the integration gave it more \\"buying power\\" in terms of attracting larger acts. In 2020, the festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The New York Times has called her the \\"matriarch of the eat-locally-think-globally food movement.\\"  Biography  Born in 1928 in Alhambra, California, Gussow grew up in a California landscape dominated by clear skies, orange groves, peach orchards and lines of eucalyptus trees. She graduated from Pomona College in Claremont, California in 1950, with a BA (pre-medical) and moved east to New York City. In 1956, she married Alan Gussow (1931–1997). Gussow spent seven years as a researcher at Time Magazine and five years as a suburban wife and mother. After becoming a researcher at Yeshiva’s Graduate School of Education, she returned to school in 1969 to earn an M.Ed and an Ed. D. in Nutrition Education from Columbia’s Teachers College. Shortly after graduating, she was hired by Teachers College to become the chair of the nutrition department, creating the legendary course, Nutritional Ecology. In 1971, she testified in front of a Congressional Committee about the poor quality of the foods advertised to children on television. Her testimony was also published in the Journal of Nutrition Education scandalizing significant portions of her chosen profession. She has served in a number of capacities for various public, private, and governmental organizations, including chairing the Boards of the National Gardening Association, the Society for Nutrition Education, the Jesse Smith Noyes Foundation, Rockland Farm Alliance and Just Food, serving two terms on the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, a term on the FDA's Food Advisory Committee and a term on the National Organic Standards Board. Joan Dye Gussow, EdD, is the first Mary Swartz Rose Professor emerita and former chair of the Nutrition Education Program at Teachers College, Columbia University, where she has been a long-time analyst and critic of the U.S. food system. In her classic 1978 book The Feeding Web: Issues in Nutritional Ecology, which tracked the environmental hazards of an increasingly globalizing food system, she foreshadowed by several decades the current interest in relocalizing the food supply. This manifesto has also made her one of the most influential people in food thinking. She has influenced the likes of Barbara Kingsolver, Michael Pollan, and Marion Nestle. Her subsequent books include The Nutrition Debate (1986), Chicken Little, Tomato Sauce and Agriculture (1991), and This Organic Life: Confessions of a Suburban Homesteader (2001), the latter based on the lessons learned from transitioning to growing virtually all of her own food at the home she shared with her husband in Piermont, New York; her husband, Alan, died while she was writing the book. Her 2010 book, Growing, Older, is as its subtitle suggests, a garden-based collection of “reflections on death, life and vegetables”. In addition to her books, she has also produced a variety of articles on food- related topics. Gussow currently lives, writes, and grows organic vegetables on the west bank of the Hudson River. She is at work on a new book based on the complete destruction and miraculous resurrection of her beloved garden. Her tentative title: “Starting Over at 81”.

The attack, a part of an anti-Jewish wave of unrest across the Middle East and North Africa, resulted in some 75 Jews murdered and several hundred wounded. In the aftermath of the riots, half the city's Jewish population fled the city. History Syria gained independence from France in April 1946. The Haganah's illegal immigration operative Akiva Feinstein wrote in 1947 that the new Syrian government then commenced persecuting the Jewish minority, that all Jewish clerks working for the French bureaucracy were fired, and the government tried to stifle Jewish businesses. At the time of the United Nations vote on November 29, 1947, the Jewish community in Aleppo numbered around 10,000 and went back around two thousand years. After the vote in favour of the partition of Palestine, the government abetted and organised Aleppo's Arab inhabitants to attack the city's Jewish population. The exact number of those killed remains unknown, but estimates are put at around 75, with several hundred wounded.Daniel Pipes, Greater Syria: The History of an Ambition, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990) p. 57, records 75 victims of the Aleppo massacre. Ten synagogues, five schools, an orphanage and a youth club, along with several Jewish shops and 150 houses were set ablaze and destroyed. Damaged property was estimated to be valued at US$2.5m. During the pogrom the Aleppo Codex, an important medieval manuscript of the Torah, was lost and feared destroyed. The book reappeared (with pages missing) in Israel in 1958. Following the attack, the Jewish community went into a steep decline. Wealthy Jews escaped the day after the pogrom and many more fled in small groups in subsequent months. Their property was forfeited and on December 22 the Syrian Government enacted a law forbidding Jews from selling their property. As of 2012, no Jews live in Aleppo.

The NWMC operated from 1989 to 2003 with branches in all Australian States and Territories with the exception of the Northern Territory. Before its final incarnation as the National Women’s Media Centre, the organisation was known as MediaSwitch, and was established to monitor and improve the portrayal of women in the media. As of 2003, the organisation ceased operations after more than a decade of campaigning for women’s rights. Background Archetypes have helped us to define the gender roles and behaviour of young women. To avoid being labelled, women have to delicately navigate the mixed messages directed at them on a daily basis. As feminists have challenged the conceptions of a ‘proper women’, dichotomies like housewife/professional are dismantled. With access to education and career paths, successful women have confidently entered traditional masculine domains.Bottrell, Dorothy. \\"The Idea of the ‘Bad Girl’.\\" Australian Review of Public Affairs July (2008): n. pag. APA FT. Web. 8 Oct. 2010. Many argue that skinny models are teaching young women to loathe their own bodies. The images cause teenagers to torture themselves with diets, beauty regimes and exercise, all in order to fit the mould. This argument is constantly repeated in popular feminist debate where many feel that advertising, commercial television and pornography routinely degrade and misrepresent women, turning them into sex objects for the perusal of men.Lumby, Catharine. \\"Girls and the New Media.\\" Meanjin 56.1 (1997): 105-113. APA FT. Web. 8 Oct. 2010. A 1994 study conducted by Mediawatch, a non-profit feminist organization which monitors the portrayal of women and girls in the media, showed that most women were negatively affected by advertisements. And recent studies still show this fact to be true. Women were polled across the country. It was uncovered that the vast majority of women were offended by the portrayal of women in ads. Tackling the sexist portrayal of women in advertising has been on the feminist agenda for decades. Mediawatch's study showed that the widespread dissatisfaction women feel with the female images used to sell them products manifests itself in different ways. While only eight per cent of women polled voiced their disapproval by writing a letter and 13 per cent made a phone call, 53 per cent said they boycotted products marketed to them in a way they found offensive. Despite these numbers, advertisers have been slow to re-evaluate the way in which they design their ad campaigns, considering that women are the principal buyers in everything from food to men's clothing. Women in advertising (mostly white and under 25) are still depicted as passive sexual objects whose weight and appearance portray them more as mannequins than humans. However, in recent years, under increasing pressure from activists groups, advertisers have, to a degree, responded to the feminists’ call and attempted to portray women in more equal and diverse roles in advertisements. The advertising industry has responded to these criticisms and pressures by portraying women in more equal roles, for example, in positions of power and responsibility.Napoli, Julie and Marie Murgolo-Poore. \\"Female Gender Images in Adolescent Magazine Advertising.\\" Australasian Marketing Journal 11.1 (2003): 60-69. APA FT. Web. 8 Oct. 2010. Resources and campaigns Aside from the issue of women’s rights and portrayals in the media, the National Women’s Media Centre also lent its weight to various political, media and socio-economic campaigns such as the ‘Support the ABC’, ‘Free Tibet’, and the ‘Net Censorship’ campaigns. The organisation had also previously released resources to empower women in managing the media and its impact on their lives. These resources included tips on how to write letters to the editor, a how-to guide on lodging complaints about issues in the media, contact lists for the various media sources and federal politicians, a guide on handling interviews and an activists’ handbook called Lobbying Made Easy. Also provided was a paid media release scheme known as Media Assist, where the National Women’s Media Centre could be engaged to provide services in planning media and public relations campaigns. Advertising standards The organisation lobbied extensively as a representative of women’s interests in negotiations between the Government, the advertising industry and consumers regarding the establishment of a new Advertising Standards system. The main intention was to persuade the Government to intervene in order to regulate an industry where the organisation viewed there was a lack of access and attention to the issues of importance to women. In October 1997, the organisation launched the Advertising Complaints Hotline as a means of providing an accessible outlet of complaint for women feeling aggrieved about sexualized advertising campaigns. The main aims of this action were to: *Keep a register of the complaints to develop an overview of women’s opinions about advertising and to monitor which complaints are being addressed by the new industry regulation systems and which are being rejected. *Assist women in framing their complaints in line with the codes. *Forward relevant complaints to the advertising industry’s regulatory system, the media carriers, and relevant members of parliament. Global Media Monitoring Project The first Global Media Monitoring Project was an imitative of the 1994 Women and Media Conference in Bangkok which was undertaken by Mediawatch Canada and executed in 1995 with the participation of seventy-one countries. The report was launched at the Beijing Women’s Forum. The second Global Media Monitoring Project was proposed at the 1997 Women and Communication Policy Forum in Manila and the National Women’s Media Centre was to co-ordinate the project in partnership with Deakin University and Mediawatch Canada.

Life  Balcar studied at the Czech Technical University in Prague (1984-1985) and at the University of Economics, Prague (1986-1987). In 1992 he enrolled Academy of Fine Arts in Prague and graduated in 1999 from studio of professor Zdeněk Beran. Most of his exhibitions since then have been in Prague, including venues such as the Liechtenstein Palace, town hall and the Rudolfinum but also the cities of Brno, Hradec Králové and at the Czech Centre in New York City. He lives and works in Prague.  Work  Motto: What I regard as important I paint, especially the important things that fascinate me. A selection-oriented approach to the concept of portrayal painting, the type of specialized orientation on figures, along with characteristic content, distinguishes Karel Balcar’s work from the majority of mainstream production in the Czech Republic – a conviction which has been confirmed by all the exhibits he has taken part in. Nonetheless, when one accounts for what the recent and contemporary events of the richly stratified pluralist scene of modern art in the world, it can be said with a clean conscience that an entirely evident and cogent context is at work here. In his voluminous publication “Art Today” Edward Lucie-Smith writes in one of several chapters dedicated to portrayal painting: One of the most surprising changes brought by the development of art in the last thirty years is that many artists have once again begun to scrutinize the pre-modernist past.Edward Lucie-Smith, Art Today, Phaidon Press (en), 1999, “Contemporary artists have, in fact, made an interesting discovery: as a result of the gulf between 20th century art and art of a distant past, they have found that there is something held in common with all the works of the masters of old – diversity – such as was once attributed only to art that was not of western origin.“ Some – mostly younger – artists are fascinated by this absurd situation. So as to avoid the danger of convention in overly cheap modern academism that runs to weeds everything in an intensely base form, they rather make a radical return to the past.

As both a direct and indirect consequence of manifold skepticism towards perspectives of contemporary civilization, it is possible to find the key amongst a great many of today’s artists, to the tendency of regressions to form portrayal, the legitimate components of which are also a path leading to the exploration of pictorial memory. The work of Karel Balcar can be categorized (even period- wise) among these contemporary endeavours, which have actually appeared throughout the entire course of the second half of the century, and which draws on the traditions of classicism, mannerism and primarily baroque illusionism. Figurative painting is, as it has been since the very beginning, a matter of cardinal destiny for Karel Balcar. He deals with it in a conscious and programmed manner. At first sight, the technical sovereignty with which the form of portrayal is handled here is arresting, however its concurrent secretiveness may be dissuading. In any case, its appeal is – in spite of the many shifts in opinion even in our constricted post-modern scene – exceptional all the same. What does this nonconformity reside in? A paradox, as if implicit within the process of originating itself, and of course also in the final form of his paintings. It seems nearly implausible that Karel Balcar himself belonged to a rare sort of talents in college, amongst whom the obstinate striving for personal release has stood far to the forefront ahead of the problems of technique itself. Such release then became the driving force in overcoming difficulty, which has simply capitulated to this will. Contentual and formal intransigence, led provocatively across temporal dimensions, may be the very fruit of such endeavour. Today, Karel Balcar controls suitable means of painting to such a degree, that he is capable to manipulate them to suit his own unconventional imagination. He is able to elicit shreds of grim tales in his pictures, in which it seems like spirits of renewed tendencies of romanticism circumambulate, multiplied by accents of stylized aggression and salacious shadiness. At the same time he manages to eschew tawdry effects of fantasy or any feigning of the cryptic, which is particularly noteworthy – he need not deviate towards even a hint of banally empty symbolist stylization. The torsos of figures, often isolated in an ambiguous environment, become kinds of lone phantoms of reality themselves, chess figures in an unfinished match. It is likely for that very reason that we feel a distinct detachment, delineating this work as postmodernist rule. The practice, hermetic forms of real form create a barrier between the stage and the auditorium. The spectator is not allowed to join in. It is as if a legacy of classicism were at work here, of that tributary of European thought that has long been furthest from modern art in its objective.

Saurashtrians trace their ancestry to the historical region of Saurashtra in Western India. Their migration to Southern India owes to the forays and desecration of the Somnath temple triggered by the frequent Muslim invasions, most notably by Mahmud Ghazni. They were a prominent industrious and prosperous mercantile community of merchants and weavers in southern India until the 20th century. Saurashtrians are Brahmins, and are also referred to as Saurashtra Brahmins. Further, like all traditional orthodox Brahmins, they are classified based on their gotra, or patrilineal descent. The majority of the people are Vaishnavas, though there is a significant proportion of Shaivas as well. They are prominently known by their unique family names and also use the titles Sharma, Rao, Iyer, Iyengar and Achary as their surnames but belong to linguistic minorities. Names Their name has many alternate spellings, including Sourashtra, Sowrashtra, Sowrastra and Sourashtri. Saurashtrians are colloquially called as Palkar among themselves. They have also been known as Patnūlkarar, but the term is obsolete.  Etymology  The word Saurashtra literally means \\"a good state\\". It is derived from Su meaning good, Rashtra meaning state and the other compound of Saura and Rashtra, meaning \\"the land of the Sun\\". These people were once sun worshipers and have built sun temples. The people worshiping Surya or Saura and inhabiting the land of the Sun are called as Saurashtrians. The Tamil name by which these people were also known in Tamil Nadu is Patnūlkarar, which means silk-thread people, mostly silk-thread merchants and silk weavers, since the early settlers set up silk-weaving guilds and were involved in the trade of silk clothes and diamonds to the royal families of Tamil country. After the Gupta dynasty, silk became the attire of royal families, the Saurashtrians were patronized by several dynasties across North India and the Chola, Pandya, Vijayanagara, Nayak and Thanjavur Maratha rulers patronized them in ancient South India. Their specialty was considered so honorable and complicated that they were in some cases exchanged as a major aspect of marriage settlements or as endowments to neighbouring kingdoms. These people are first mentioned as Pattavayaka, the Sanskrit equivalent of Patnūlkarar in the Mandasor (present day Madhya Pradesh) inscriptions of Kumaragupta I belonging to the 5th century AD. They are also mentioned by the same name in the Patteeswaram inscriptions of Thanjavur belonging to the mid 16th century AD and in the inscriptions of Rani Mangammal of Madurai belonging to the 17th century AD. Identity Saurashtrians are well assimilated in Tamil society, without any outward differentiation. Apart from certain religious adherences, brahminism and vegetarianism, their culture is similar to the rest of Tamil Nadu. Though, their physical features are not similar to Tamils, they have Tamil names and are essentially a part of Tamil people, yet distinct in their ethnic identity and can be called as Saurashtrian Tamils.  Origin  The Bhagavata Purana mentions that the ancient Abhiras were the rulers of Saurashtra Kingdom and Avanti Kingdom and they were followers of the Vedas, who worshiped Vishnu as their supreme deity. These ancient provinces as depicted in the epic literature of Mahabharata roughly corresponds to the present day Saurashtra region of southern Gujarat and Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh. Their origin is Dwarka, land of Lord Krishna, the origin of the name date backs to the time when the ancestors of these people inhabited the Lata region of Saurashtra in southern Gujarat.J.S. Venkatavarma, Sourashtra Charitra Sangraham (Madura, 1915) Saurashtrians are originally Gauda Brahmins and belong to Pancha-Gauda Brahmins. After their southward migration they have been called as Saurashtra Brahmins. They had their original homes in present-day Gujarat and migrated to South India over a millennium ago. They are currently scattered over various places of Tamil Nadu and are mostly concentrated in Madurai, Thanjavur and Salem Districts.\\"The Saurashtra Community in Madurai, South India\\", Albert James Saunders, The American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 32, No. 5 (Mar. 1927) pp. 787-799, published by: The University of Chicago Press.  History  Saurashtrians migrated from southern Gujarat in 11th century AD after the fall of Somnath Temple when Mahmud of Ghazni invaded India. It is said that the Saurashtrians lived in Devagiri, the present day Daulatabad of Maharashtra during the regime of the Yadava kings up to 13th century AD. After the fall of Yadavas in 14th century AD they moved to Vijayanagar Empire, with its capital at Hampi in present-day Karnataka by the invitation of the Kings. The expansion of Vijayanagar empire brought the Saurashtrians into South India in 14th century AD, since they were highly skilled manufacturers of fine silk garments and were patronized by the Kings and their families. After the fall of Vijayanagar empire they were welcomed by the Nayak Kings of Thanjavur during mid 16th century AD and Madurai during 17th century AD and were allowed to settle near the Thirumalai Nayakkar Palace.  Social Division =Occupation, divisions, sects and gotras From the view point of an outsider the community may be seen as a homogenous one. However, in reality many subdivisions exist among them at various levels. Occupationally, the Saurashtrians may be classified broadly as priests, merchants and weavers. =Divisions= When the Saurashtrians settled in the South, they reproduced the institutions of their mother country in the new land, but, owing to the influence of the Southern Dravidians, some of the institutions became extinct. During their migrations, the men were under the guidance of their leader and the process of migration tended to increase the power of kinship. The people were divided into 5 heads - *Goundans (Chiefs); *Soulins (Elders); *Voyduns (Physicians); *Bhoutuls (Religious men); *Karesthals (Commons). Traces of this institution still survive. The Goundans were the judges in both civil and criminal affairs. They were aided in deciding cases by a body of nobles called Soulins. The office of the Soulins is to make enquiries, and try all cases connected with the community, and to abide by the decision of the chiefs. The Voyduns (vaidyas) and Bhoutuls (pandits, joshis and kavis) also ranked with Voyduns and had their honours on all important occasions, and they are placed in the same rank with the elders. The Karesthals (commons), are the whole body of masses. Their voice is necessary on certain important occasions, as during the ceremonies of excommunication, prayaschittas for admitting renegades, and during periodical meetings of the community. =Sects= The Saurashtrians may further be divided into three sects on a religious basis. viz., * Vaishnavites, who wear the vertical Vaishnavite mark, and call themselves northerners; * Smarthas, who wear horizontal marks; * Madhvas, who wear gopi (Sandal paste) as their sect mark. All the above three divisions intermarry and interdine, and the religious difference does not create a distinction in the community. The Saurashtrians classify their ancestors as originally belonging to the two lines of Thiriyarisham and Pancharisham descent groups. They follow Apastamba Dharmasutra and belong to the Ahobila and Sankaracharya Mathas. Their religion is Hinduism, they follow Yajurveda, and they were originally Madhvas. After their settlement in Southern India, some of them, owing to the preachings of Sankaracharya and Ramanujacharya, were converted into Saivites and Vaishnavites respectively. =Gotras= Saurashtrians, like all other Hindu Brahmins, trace their paternal ancestors to one of the seven or eight sages, the saptarishis. They classify themselves into gotras, named after the ancestor rishi and each gotra consists of different family names. The gotra was inherited from Guru at the time of Upanayana, in ancient times, so it is a remnant of Guru-shishya tradition, but since the tradition is no longer followed, during Upanayana ceremony father acts as Guru of his son, so the son inherits his father's gotra. The entire community consists of 64 gotras. Saurashtrians belong to following gotras. Marriage within common gotra is strictly prohibited. =Kuladevatas= Every Saurashtrian family has their own family patron deity or the Kuladevata. This deity is common to a lineage or a clan of several families who are connected to each other through a common ancestor. The practice of worshiping local or territorial deities as Kuladevata began in the period of the Yadava dynasty.  Culture =Saṃskāras, rituals and Festivals Saurashtrians have been traditionally an orthodox and closely knit community. They are essentially northern in their customs, manners and social structure. Traditionally, joint family was a social and economic unit for them. Moreover, the pattern of joint family helped them transmit their traditional culture to the younger generations. =Saṃskāras= Saurashtrians strictly adhere to all the Ṣoḍaśa Saṃskāra or 16 Hindu Samskaras, out of which, the main social customs among them consist of six social ceremonies in the life of a person. (1) the naming ceremony; (2) the sacred thread ceremony; (3) puberty; (4) marriage; (5) the attainment of the age of sixty; (6) the funeral rites. The rites that are performed following the birth of a child are known as jathakarma. The naming ceremony in particular is known as namakaranam. The main aim of performing these birth ceremonies is to purify and to safeguard the child from diseases. These rituals are believed to check the ill effects of Planetary movement. The above rites were carried out on the eleventh day after birth of the child. Grandfather's name was much preferred for a male child and the name of a female deity was suggested for female child. The vaduhom ceremony (sacred thread ceremony) of Saurashtrians is basically the upanayanam ceremony. This ceremony is exceedingly important among them. This is performed between seventh and thirteenth years. In rare cases when the sacred thread ceremony was not held in the young ages, it would be performed at the time of marriage. The goal of this ceremony was to highlight their Brahminical status. During this ceremony there was much feasting and entertainment which lasted for four days. Among the Saurashtrians, attaining puberty was the greatest event in a girl's life. They also perform a pre-puberty marriage. The wedding ceremony lasted 11 days with as many as 36 rituals. All these rituals were conducted by the Saurashtrian priests who were a separate clan in the community. The Saurashtrians have their own marital arrangements. Before a marriage is fixed, a long negotiation takes place between the parents of both partners. Being traditional orthodox Brahmins they are very much particular in matching the horoscope of the couple. A man may claim his maternal uncle's daughter as his wife, and polygamy is permitted. Girls get married at an early age. Marriage within common gotra is strictly prohibited among them. Death rituals are termed as abarakkirigai or andhiyaeshti in the Saurashtrian community. Andhiyaeshti means the last or final fire. These rituals are carried out by the eldest son of the deceased. In case of no son, the relatives carry out the last rites. Kartha is the name given to the one who carries out this rite. The performance of the rite signifies the belief that the life is continuous and does not end by one's death. Further, the deceased are believed to reach the level of the deities. The period of mourning lasts for ten days, but it is repeated every year in the form of sraddha ceremonies. =Festivals= The Saurashtrians are of a religious bent of mind and they value morality and high character. The chief divinity of Saurashtrians is Venkateshwara of Tirupati. Among other Gods they worshipped Sun God, Rama etc. They made regular visits to Meenakshi temple. They celebrate Kolattam, Chithirai festival and Ramanavami with great enthusiasm, and observe Deepawali, Ganesh Chathurthi, Dussehra, Vaikunta Ekadasi and Avani Avittam as important religious days. Their present social customs differ markedly from the traditional pattern and bear a close resemblance to those of Tamils. Only some orthodox well-to-do merchant families stick to their older customs. Attire The way of living of the Saurashtrian men resembles to that of Iyengar Brahmins and the living of Saurashtrian women resembles to that of Telugu Brahmins . Saurashtrian men wear dhoti or veshti with a shirt and scarf called khesa just like other Brahmin men. The men keep the hair-knot or sikha on the head with a vermilion mark or naamam on their forehead. The Saurashtrian women wear saree in a different manner than the Tamil women. The unmarried ones wear in Bengali style, while the married ones wear in Marathi style. The shape and size of the ornaments worn by the Saurashtrian women are similar to that of Telugu Brahmin women. The ornaments are mostly made of precious diamonds and gold. The women also put vermilion mark on their foreheads just like the males but in smaller length and also decorate their head with flowers called as veni. Cuisine The Saurashtrian cuisine is famous for its mixed rice dishes that includes puliyotharai (tamarind rice), tomato rice with a hint of cinnamon, kalkandu (sugar candy) rice, sakkarai pongal (a dessert made of cotton seed milk) and lemon rice. Apart from these dishes Saurashtrians have special liking towards halva and poli. Other South Indian delicacies such as dosas, idli and sambar etc. are also favored by the Saurashtrians. Several historians believe that it was Saurashtrian textile merchants who introduced idly to South India during the 10th and 12th centuries. There are even claims that a mix of rice and urad dal ground together and later steamed to form cakes had its origins in Gujarat. This was called Iddada. Another dish that the Saurashtrian traders brought to Madurai in the 16th century is a vada made from deep-fried spinach, it became the keerai vadai and remains a specialty of Madurai. =Diet= Traditionally, Saurashtrians are vegetarian and those who are involved in priesthood activities adhere to strict vegetarianism. Rice is their staple food along with sambar, gojju & amti (rasam). However, nowadays, some occasionally take non-vegetarian food. Demographics There are three group of Saurashtrians living in Tamil Nadu. First migrants came to Salem and settled there, second group of migrants settled in Thanjavur and its surrounding places and later third group of migrants settled in Madurai and its surrounding places. Saurashtrians maintain a predominant presence in Madurai, a city, also known as 'Temple City' in the southern part of Tamil Nadu. Though official figures are hard to come by, it is believed that the Saurashtrian population is anywhere between one-fourth and one-fifth of the city's total population. They are present in significant numbers in Ambur, Ammapettai, Ammayappan, Aranthangi, Arni, Ayyampettai, Bhuvanagiri, Chennai, Dharasuram, Dindigul, Erode, Kancheepuram, Kanyakumari, Karaikudi, Kottar, Krishnapuram, Kumbakonam, Namakkal, Nilakottai, Palani, Palayamkottai, Paramakudi, Parambur, Periyakulam, Puducherry, Pudukkottai, Rajapalayam, Ramanathapuram, Salem, Thanjavur, Thirubhuvanam, Thiruvaiyaru, Thiruvarur, Thuvarankurichi, Tirunelveli, Tiruvannamalai, Illuppur, Thiruvappur, Trichy, Vaniyambadi, Veeravanallur, Vellanguli, Pudukudi, Kilakukulam, Krishnapuram, Vellore, Walajapet in Tamil Nadu. They are also present in Trivandrum and Kochi in Kerala, Bengaluru in Karnataka, Hyderabad in Telangana and Tirupati, Vizianagaram, Vijayawada, Nellore, Srikakulam, Vishakapatnam in Andhra Pradesh are said to house several Saurashtrian families, known as Pattusali. Language The mother tongue of Saurashtrians is Saurashtra (alternate names and spellings: Sourashtra, Sowrashtra, Sourashtri, Palkar), a dialect of Gujarati with the amalgamation of present-day Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, Konkani, Kannada, Telugu & Tamil but all of them are bilingual and can speak either Tamil or Telugu or one of the local languages. Saurashtra, an offshoot of Sauraseni Prakrit, once spoken in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, is spoken today chiefly by the population of Saurashtrians settled in parts of Tamil Nadu. With the Saurashtrian language being the only Indo-Aryan language employing a Dravidian script and is heavily influenced by the Dravidian languages such as Tamil and Telugu. However, Census of India places the language under Gujarati.  Genetics  Organisation  The prominent leaders among the community arose in the late 19th century and felt the need of organizing the community. At first, the Madurai Saurashtra Sabha was formed in the year 1895 and it was formally registered in the year 1900 with many objectives. The formation of this Sabha was the first step towards social mobilization. The Sabha's administration is carried out by elected Councillors and office bearers. It has its own rules and regulations regarding holding of elections, rights and duties of office bearers and celebration of social functions. The election to the Sabha is held once in three years. The social life of the Saurashtrians is controlled almost wholly by the Saurashtra Sabha. This organisation is a committee of the leading men of the community, which manages and controls all the schools and public institutions, the temple and its worship, and all political, religious, and social questions among the Saurashtrians. The Saurashtra Madhya (central) Sabha, which has its headquarters at Madurai now remains as the cultural center for all the Saurashtrians living in Tamil Nadu. Many well-to-do merchants and philanthropists of the community have contributed substantially to the growth of these institutions. Today, the Saurashtrians are represented in white collar jobs and professions in large numbers. In 2009, Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat and the current and 14th Prime Minister of India, inaugurated the Research Institute of Saurashtra Heritage and Immigration (RISHI), a project in association with Saurashtra University, Rajkot.  Politics  In the second decade of 20th century, the Saurashtrians emerged as a dominant group in social and political life of Madras Presidency. The Saurashtrians emerged as the dominant social group because of their collective mobilization, intellectual leadership, education, wealth, trade and enterprise. There are several instances when the leaders of the community organised the weavers and made social and economic protests. The well-to-do merchants of the community made donations to TNCC for Salt Satyagraha and welcomed any form of Swadeshi agitation which favoured Indian cloth. The leaders who came to lead the community were not always from the upper class. L. K. Thulasiram, who led the community in Madurai, was not born into the aristocratic family. With his own efforts he travelled abroad which brought prosperity to himself and to the community in general. Thulasiram at first supported the non-Brahmin movement in Tamil Nadu. When he earned the displeasure of his community members who were fighting for Brahminical status, he changed his mind and supported the cause of his own people. He got elected as Municipal Chairman in 1921 amidst a fierce contest. During his tenure he brought many reforms within the community. He introduced free mid-day meal scheme in community owned school for the first time in the country which was later emulated by the Government of Tamil Nadu during the period of K. Kamaraj in the name of noon-meal scheme in Government schools. When he lost his hold in Municipal Council, he became a prominent organizer of non-cooperation movement. Later he impressed the Congress Party and became the leader of the merchants. In this capacity he strove hard to raise the prestige and position of his community. N.M.R. Subbaraman, another leader of the community, financed and led the Civil Disobedience Movement In Madurai from 1930-32. He worked for the advancement of the depressed classes. He, along with A. Vaidyanatha Iyer, organised a temple entry conference and helped the people of the depressed classes to enter Meenakshi Amman Temple. He was involved in the Bhoodan movement and donated his 100 acres of land to the movement. He contributed to establishing the first Gandhi Memorial Museum in Madurai. Later he expressed his dissatisfaction with Civil Disobedience. He felt unhappy about the expenditure incurred on the agitational activities. He mobilized his followers into Municipal politics with the help of Venkatamarama Iyer faction under the Congress banner.

It was screened at The Next Web conference in Amsterdam on 4 April 2008 and broadcast by the Dutch documentary series Backlight () on Nederland 2 on 7 April 2008. It was subsequently made available through American Public Television. The documentary examines the reliability of Wikipedia, and the dichotomy between the contributions of experts and amateur editors. The documentary includes commentary from Wikipedia co-founders Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, The Cult of the Amateur author Andrew Keen, O'Reilly Media chief executive officer Tim O'Reilly, and former editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica Robert McHenry. Keen says that experts should serve as guardians of information during the Web 2.0 phenomenon; this point of view is supported by analysis from Sanger. The Truth According to Wikipedia received a generally positive reception, being described in Film Quarterly as \\"a sharp and wide-ranging overview of wikipistemology\\". The Center for Strategic and International Studies gave the documentary a rating of \\"Good\\", and called it a useful resource to teach students about appropriate sourcing. Media scholar Mirko Tobias Schäfer described it as an apt debate over truth as represented on the website. New media writer Stephen Downes said the documentary was captivating for its ability to place Wikipedia within the wider context of the Web 3.0 social phenomenon. Contents summary Commentary from Larry Sanger supports an analysis made by Andrew Keen in the documentary. Director IJsbrand van Veelen examines questions about Wikipedia, such as whether it will harm traditional encyclopaedias, including Encyclopædia Britannica. He presents commentators who discuss the reliability of Wikipedia. Veelen also addresses the idea that information wants to be free. The documentary notes that within the period of 2006 to 2008, Wikipedia has increasingly been recognized as one of the top most popular websites, and that it often rivaled Google for those searching for information on the Internet. Individuals who are interviewed and appear as commentators in the film include: Wikipedia co-founders Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger; The Cult of the Amateur author Andrew Keen; How Wikipedia Works author and Wikipedia editor Phoebe Ayers; Swahili Wikipedia contributor Ndesanjo Macha; O'Reilly Media chief executive officer Tim O'Reilly; We Think author Charles Leadbeater; and former Encyclopædia Britannica editor-in-chief Robert McHenry. Discussion topics include how the contributions of both unqualified and expert users affect Wikipedia, and more broadly, the Web 2.0 phenomenon. Charles Leadbetter puts forth the notion that the wider online community is an effective method of increasing the ideals of democracy. Leadbetter says the Web is the most effective medium for increasing individual freedoms and rights in totalitarian nations. Andrew Keen is featured prominently in the documentary, and puts forth a thesis that veracity of information should be determined by experts who should function as guardians for such material. Keen says that without expert gatekeepers to discern what actual facts are, the danger exists that the wider community may simply invent its own perceived truths. Keen opines that in this unfortunate situation actual facts would instead be supplanted by \\"truthiness\\". Keen's argument is supported in the documentary by commentary from Larry Sanger, who left Wikipedia over a conflict with Jimmy Wales regarding Sanger's desire for experts to be given additional influence on the project. Sanger acknowledges that in the early stages of Wikipedia, factual accuracy of articles was neglected in favor of a drive to increase raw content on the fledgling website. Production The Truth According to Wikipedia was directed by IJsbrand van Veelen. He had previously directed the Backlight documentary Google: Behind the Screen. Interviews were conducted by Marijntje Denters, Martijn Kieft and IJsbrand van Veelen. William de Bruijn, Marijntje Denters, and Martijn Kieft researched and gathered information for the documentary. Judith van den Berg was the producer, and editors were Jos de Putter and Doke Romeijn. The documentary utilized 60 seconds of footage from a video made by Chris Pirillo, who later objected that such usage was done without obtaining his permission or crediting him with the content. The documentary was released in 2008, during which time the controversy over the censorship of Wikipedia in China was ongoing. The documentary premiered globally at The Next Web conference in Amsterdam on 4 April 2008. It was broadcast by VPRO on Nederland 2 on 7 April 2008, and was made available for viewing on its YouTube channel the same year. The organization American Public Television (APT) began to make the documentary available in the summer of 2008, and was contracted to show the documentary as an APT program from February 2009 through January 2011. Reception Thomas Leitch wrote in his book Wikipedia U that Andrew Keen (pictured) expressed a significant viewpoint in the documentary which merited further debate. The Truth According to Wikipedia received a positive review in the journal Film Quarterly, where author Ben Walters‌ called the documentary, \\"a sharp and wide-ranging overview of wikipistemology\\". In a report entitled Teaching Seven Revolutions: A Tool Kit for Educating Globally Competent Citizens published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the documentary was given a rating of: \\"Good – especially if students think Wikipedia is the one source for everything\\". It was recommended as a resource to learn about information science. Author Thomas Leitch in his book Wikipedia U wrote that Keen's perspective on Wikipedia in particular and Web 2.0 in general as expressed in the documentary was a significant viewpoint. Leitch said the criticism directed at Wikipedia by Keen merited further debate because it reflected assumptions explaining why Wikipedia was met with wariness by educators that discouraged the encyclopedia's use in a classroom setting. Bastard Culture! author Mirko Tobias Schäfer called the documentary a well-received analysis of the discussion over truth on Wikipedia. The Truth According to Wikipedia was given positive reception by Eric Schonfeld of TechCrunch, who commented that the film was expertly created. Though he praised the documentary for displaying multiple different viewpoints, he was critical of the documentary's emphasis on Andrew Keen throughout, and said it became a tool for Keen to publicize his polemics against Wikipedia. Schonfeld assessed that Keen came away as the winner of his thesis by the end of the documentary. Of Keen's argument, Schonfeld pointed out that he did not address how researchers on Wikipedia could either be experts themselves, or subsequently become experts by virtue of improving the quality of articles on the website. Commenting on the documentary himself, Keen called it an enlightening documentary. Media futurist, blogger, and writer Gerd Leonhard recommended the documentary and called it most entertaining. Nicholas Carlson of Gawker Media framed the documentary as a conflict of \\"Experts vs. amateurs\\", and distilled the essence of the documentary down to a 90-second version. Designer and commentator in the fields of online learning and new media Stephen Downes characterized The Truth According to Wikipedia as a fascinating documentary both about its website of focus and the larger phenomenon of Web 2.0. Downes was critical of the film's use a documentary- style format in order to present its message, and argued that the viewpoints presented were not subsequently backed up by documentation. Ernst-Jan Pfauth of The Next Web praised the documentary's director for gathering together a varied group of experts to comment upon Wikipedia for the documentary. He posed questions raised by the documentary's analysis, and wondered whether the Web had succeeded in increasing intelligence and accuracy within society. Pfauth asked: \\"Are equality and truth really reconcilable ideals?\\" See also *Bibliography of Wikipedia *List of films about Wikipedia *Truth in Numbers? *The Virtual Revolution FootnotesReferencesFurther reading * External links * Wiki's Waarheid (in Dutch) at the Backlight website * * Category:Dutch documentary films Category:Dutch films Category:Films about Wikipedia ","title":"The Truth According to Wikipedia"},{"id":"29247840","text":"The Supreme Court of the Republic of Albania () is the highest court of Albania and is the final court of appeal in the judicial system of Albania. It is composed of seventeen judges, the Chief Justice and sixteen Members.http://www.gjykataelarte.gov.al/anetaret.htm Members of the Court The Supreme Court is the highest court in the judicial branch of the country with its premises located in Tirana. Its main mission is to review the decisions of lower instance courts upon the appeal from one of the parties. It reviews the matter at hand dealing with only with issues of law, without judging the facts, thus guaranteeing through its jurisprudence uniformity in the application of the law and a unified judicial practice.http://www.gjykataelarte.gov.al/web/The_Supreme_Court_4_2.php The Supreme Court  History  The historical context of the development of the current Supreme Court can be divided in the following time periods.Background  1912—1920  The Declaration of Independence marked the first steps in institution-building for the nascent Albanian state. The Assembly of Vlora and the Government headed by Ismail Qemali amongst other important initiatives, such as the creation of the main legislative and executive institutions, also focused on organizing the Judiciary among Western European lines. Thus on May 10, 1913 \\"The Canon of Jury\\" was approved; this first Act constituted a cornerstone for the organization and functioning of the courts in the Albanian judicial system. The \\"Canon of Jury\\" envisaged the creation of the Dictation Court, sub-districts Courts of First Instance Courts, which would be competent for civil matters and minor offenses, as well as the Peoples’ Court, composed of a jury of common people who would adjudicate matters in criminal cases. According to historical data, the jury system was implemented only once for a trial in the Province of Elbasan, but it failed to meet expectations and thus it was repealed on June 4, 1914. On that same day a new law was promulgated, which amended the Appeals process by establishing the Primary Appeals Court to serve as a corts of Second Instance and a supreme Dictation Court.  1920—1939  During the interbellum period 1920-1939, the most important issues for the strengthening of the rule of law in Albania concerned legal reform, the reorganization of the Judiciary and the increase of professional competency of its employees. It was during this period that the organization and functioning of the Judiciary in Albania was consolidated and its role strengthened. In 1925, the Fundamental Statute of the Albanian Republic was approved by Parliament, stipulating in Article 102 that any Judge or Prosecutor would be appointed by the President of the Republic on the proposal of the Minister of Justice. During the Albanian Republic, the Judicial system was organized as follows: * Religious Courts - each recognized religion had its independent court. The decisions taken by these courts were enforced by the court execution offices included in the sub-district courts. * Special Military Court - the first such court was created in the city of Shkodra. Its composition involved three Officers, two Lay judges and a civil Prosecutor. The jurisdiction of this Court covered all matters related to the disruption of public order, military officers who had fought against the Republican Guard as well as all those citizens who opposed the orders of government officials. * Special Political Court - this court was headed by an officer and was composed of two judges and two other officers, elected by the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Internal Affairs respectively. The decisions issued by this court needed to be approved by the Minister of the Interior to become final and binding, whereas in the cases when the death penalty was to be imposed the approval of the Chair of Parliament was required. * State Supreme Court - an ad hoc court composed of five Senators and the Heads of the Dictation Courts, competent to judge Minister's and high state officials’ abuse of power, political crimes and allegations of \\"High Treason\\" against the State or the Sovereign. In 1928, Albania transitioned from a Republican government into a Monarchy. As part of this Constitutional transformation, there were also significant changes in the organization of the Albanian Judiciary. For instance, the law “On the organization of the Judiciary“, approved on 1 April 1929, sanctioned the division of courts as follows: * Courts of the Peace - operated at the center of every district and sub- district and were divided into three categories, according to their respective power: * Courts of First Instance - collegiate courts, exercising their jurisdiction within the boundaries of their respective District. These courts were divided into Primary Courts and Collegial Courts: * Primary Courts - First Instance courts responsible for all penal cases that fell under the jurisdiction of the Courts of the Peace, provided that those offences had taken place within the District boundaries. * Collegiate Courts - composed of the President of the court together with two Members, it had jurisdiction on all criminal cases that would qualify for a sentence of imprisonment of over three years. * Dictation Court - the highest court in the land, it was divided into two Departments, respectively the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Penal Affairs. Every Department comprised a President, four associate Members, an assistant Member, a Registrar, all supported by secretaries, clerks and assistants. The Dictation Court also incorporated the Office of the Chief Prosecutor, who was assisted by a Deputy Chief Prosecutor, a secretary, an archivist and an assistant. The separate Departments of the Dictation Court could come together into a Unified Chamber, whose role was overseeing the fair distribution of justice and reviewing the performance of all judges. * Council of State - During the Albanian Kingdom, the functions of a Supreme Administrative Court were exercised by the Albanian Council of State, which was divided into the Judicial section, Administration and Finance section and the Economy and Telecommunications section.  1944—1990  After the end of WWII, the newly formed Communist-controlled government reorganized the Judicial system once again. For this reason, the People's Assembly enacted in 1951 the Law “On the organization of the judiciary”, created a Supreme Court, composed of the following four Colleges: * Penal College * Civil College * Military College * Disciplinary college Each College was responsible for reviewing matters falling within its sphere and it sat as a judicial panel composed of the Chair of the College, one Member of the Supreme Court and two Judicial Assistants. In contrast to the other Colleges, the Disciplinary College was concerned with adjudicating potential from Judges, Court Presidents, members of the Military Courts and members of the Supreme Court. The judicial panel consisted of the President and two members of the Supreme Court, or alternatively the Deputy President and two members as appointed by the President themself. For certain important cases, the Supreme Court could hear cases en banc, where the President, the Deputy Heads of the court as well as all the members of the Supreme Court would be present. The general judicial practice offered by the Supreme Court, served as a guide for lower courts decisions which needed to be compliant with the legislation in power, but also with Communist ideology and the political demands of the time.  1991 - present  Façade of the Supreme Court. With the fall of communism in Albania, a lot of changes needed to be made in the almost every area of life to adapt to the new system, including reforming the Judiciary as a whole. In order to implement the Democratic principles of respecting the Rule of Law and equality before the law, the National Assembly approved on 29 April 1991 the Law No.7491 \\"On the Main Constitutional Provisions”, which structured the Judicial system into a supreme Court of Cassation, the Courts of Appeals, the Courts of First Instance and the Military Courts. According to the new law, the President and Deputy Chairmen of the Court of Cassation were elected by Parliament on the proposal of the President of the Republic, whereas the Judges were elected by the Parliament on the proposal of the Minister of Justice. All members of the Court would be elected for a term of 7 years with no right of reelection. The Court of Cassation could not assess any matters as a court of principal jurisdiction, but it could rule as a court of second instance on a few matters as stipulated by law. The adoption of the Constitution of the Republic of Albania in November 1998, sanctioned a Judicial system of three Instances, providing that \\"The judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court, the Appellate courts and the courts of first instance, which are established by law...\\" . The newly established Supreme Court would be composed of 17 members, appointed to office by the decree of the President of the Republic and the consent of the Assembly, they would serve for a term of 9-years without the right of reelection. The Constitution sanctions the role of the Supreme Court as both of principal jurisdiction and as a court that reviews the decisions of the intermediate (appeals) courts. Therefore, in cases concerning penal charges against the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and members of the Council of Ministers, members of the Parliament and Judges of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court acts as a court of first instance, while it acts as a court of last resort for all other cases. On 15 March 2000 the National Assembly passed Law Nr. 8588 \\"On the Organization and Functioning of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Albania\\", which further improved the organization of the court and strengthened its status as an independent constitutional institution. By virtue of the law and an amendment in 2013 by Law Nr. 151, the Supreme Court is divided into a Civil College, a Penal College, an Administrative College, which have jurisdiction for a specified area, and the en banc United College. When functioning as a court of last resort, the Supreme Court of Albania hears legal recourses from aggrieved parties and reviews the validity of decisions of the lower courts for the case aggrieved. In certain cases when the Supreme Court wants to clarify the interpretation of a given legal provision or change previous court practice, the court may form the Unified Colleges, in which all members hear the case en banc and its decision and interpretation of the law forms part of a unified judicial practice, which is binding on all lower courts and also on the decisions of the separate Colleges of said court. The President of the Supreme Court is appointed by the President, after having been given the consent of Parliament and the members in office of the Supreme Court. The President presides under the same mandate that made the later a member of the Supreme Court. Besides their judicial functions, the President is the official representative of the institution and has the authority to appoint and dismiss Judicial Assistants and support staff, as well as to manage the funds allocated to the institution.  Judges  The Supreme Court is composed of 17 Members. Supreme Court Judges are selected and appointed amongst judges with more than 10 years of seniority or prominent lawyers who have exercised their activity for more than 15 years. The President of the Republic with the consent of Parliament appoints the Members of the Supreme Court. The members of Supreme Court can serve for a single term of 9-years, without the right of reappointment. The Supreme Court of Albania consists of the following members: *Xhezair Zaganjori (President) *Ardian Dvorani *Ardian Nuni *Ariana Fullani *Evelina Qirjako *Guxim Zenelaj *Majlinda Andrea *Andi Çeliku *Aleksandër Muskaj *Mirela Fana (Gjylameti) *Medi Bici *Edmond Islamaj *Shkëlzen Selimi *Artan Zeneli *Admir Thanza *Tom Ndreca *Artan Broci  Law clerks  Members of the Supreme Court are assisted by up to two law clerks, who are officially referred as Judicial Advisors, and who help the judges by examining Appeal Court files, preparing memoranda where they express their opinion on the matters of case under review, responding to complaints, preparing the necessary court documents and performing any other tasks assigned by their judge. Judicial Assistants are selected by the judges themselves and appointed by the President of the Supreme Court. In order to qualify for the position of Judicial Assistant, a candidate must be a lawyer who meets the legal criteria to be appointed as a judge of first instance or appellate courts.

Early life and career Clark was born in Cullen, Banffshire, Scotland, and was educated at Fordyce School. He studied at Aberdeen University, where he took an arts degree with the intention of studying law, and graduated as a M.A., before discovering a preference for medicine. He then went to Edinburgh University, and in 1809 became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.Munk's Roll: Sir James Clark. Munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2012-05-21.Royal College of Physicians: Sir James Clark. Aim25.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2012-05-21. He then entered the medical service of the Royal Navy. He served at the Royal Hospital Haslar, in Hampshire, until July 1810, when he was appointed assistant-surgeon aboard . After the ship was wrecked in 1811 south of Sandy Hook in New Jersey, he returned to Great Britain, where he was promoted to the rank of surgeon, and served successively on HMS Colobrée, which was also wrecked, as well as on Chesapeake and Maidstone. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, he continued his studies in Edinburgh, where he graduated in 1817 with an MD. In 1818, he travelled to the south of France and Switzerland with a gentleman suffering from phthisis (tuberculosis). He began collecting meteorological and other data, and noted the effects of changes in climate on the disease. He settled in Rome in 1819, and developed a medical practice there, with steadily increasing reputation and pecuniary success. One of his patients was the poet John Keats, who arrived in Rome in November 1820. Clark thought that \\"mental exertions and application\\" were \\"the sources of his complaints\\", which he believed were \\"situated in his Stomach\\". When he finally diagnosed consumption, he put Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day, to cut the flow of blood to his stomach. He also regularly drew blood from him, and took away Keats' supply of laudanum for fear that he would take a deliberate overdose. It has been suggested in recent years that Clark's treatment of Keats contributed to the poet's agonising death from tuberculosis in February 1821.Flood, Alison. \\"Doctor's mistakes to blame for Keats's agonising end, says new biography\\". The Guardian, 26 October 2009. Retrieved 29 January 2010. In 1822, while in Rome, Clark published Medical Notes on Climate, Diseases, Hospitals, and Medical Schools in France, Italy, and Switzerland, comprising an Inquiry into the Effects of a Residence in the South of Europe in Cases of Pulmonary Consumption. He also made contact with members of the European royal families and aristocracy, among them Prince Leopold, later King of the Belgians, as well as English aristocrats travelling in Europe. At Carlsbad (now Karlovy Vary), Prince Leopold found Clark examining the waters, and was struck with the desire to learn their uses. On his return to England, he appointed Clark as his physician. Clark returned to London in 1826, and was admitted as a Licentiate of the College of Physicians and appointed physician to St George's Infirmary. He steadily built up a medical practice in London, and in 1829 published what was described as his \\"best and most important work\\", The Influence of Climate in the Prevention and Cure of Chronic Diseases, more particularly of the Chest and Digestive Organs. In it, he systematised and popularised all that was really known upon the subject, and gave a more correct view of the powers of climate and of mineral waters in the treatment of disease than had hitherto existed in the English language. The book established his reputation in London and with the members of his own profession. He promoted the use of mineral waters to treat disease, and became both famous and popular for the care he took in his prescriptions. He thought it \\"not beneath his notice or his dignity to study the art of prescribing practically, and by repeated trials, and his prescriptions compared favourably with those of most of his contemporaries.\\" He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1832. Physician to Queen Victoria A photograph of James Clark In 1834, King Leopold recommended Clark as court physician to his widowed sister, the Duchess of Kent, and her daughter, Princess Victoria. King Leopold made him a knight in his order of Leopold in 1834 and a commander in 1850. This appointment led to a large increase in his business and reputation. He published his Treatise on Pulmonary Consumption, comprehending an Inquiry into the Causes, Nature, Prevention, and Treatment of Tuberculous and Scrofulous Diseases in general, in eight volumes in 1835. On 11 November 1837, sixth months after Victoria's accession to the throne, Clark was appointed the Queen's Physician-in-Ordinary, and was created baronet of St George's Hanover Square, London. His popularity was undermined by scandal when, in January 1839, he was asked to diagnose an abdominal swelling suffered by the unmarried Lady Flora Hastings. Clark said that he could not diagnose her condition without an examination, which Flora initially refused; however, Clark assumed that the swelling was a pregnancy. Flora's enemies, Baroness Louise Lehzen and the Marchioness of Tavistock then spread the rumour that she was pregnant, and the Queen wrote in her journal that she suspected that John Conroy, a man she loathed intensely, was the father. It was assumed by the public at the time that Clark had \\"given support to a slander against [Flora]’s character by sharing suspicions which his medical knowledge should have dissipated.\\" When Flora finally consented to an examination, it was discovered that she was not pregnant but had an advanced, cancerous liver tumour, from which she died a few months later. Conroy and her brother, Lord Hastings, stirred up a press campaign against both the Queen and Clark which attacked them for insulting and disgracing Flora with false rumours, and for plotting against her and her family.Elizabeth Longford, Victoria RI, 1964, Karolyn Shindler, Queen Victoria: the day the people vented their fury, Daily Telegraph, 3 March 2009 The effect upon his practice was immediate; it was years before it passed off, and was never wholly obliterated; but within his lifetime it became generally understood that he had been wrongly blamed. In 1840 Clark was also appointed physician to Prince Albert, and he became a trusted advisor to the royal family on all medical matters. Reportedly, \\"he gradually became most unwittingly a power in the State. Always about the Court, high in the favour of the sovereign, and known to be greatly esteemed by the prince consort, he became the person to whom statesmen constantly referred for advice connected with medical matters and polity. He was always ready with advice, with suggestion, and wise, considered counsel.\\" He served on several Royal Commissions, and on the Senate of the University of London from 1838. He was credited with developing the medical section of the University. Clark also played an influential role in establishing the Royal College of Chemistry in 1845, and served on the General Medical Council from 1858 to 1860. In 1866 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). Retirement and death He began a process of gradual retirement in 1860, and moved to Bagshot Park, Surrey, which the Queen had lent him for life. His wife, Barbara Stephen, known as Minnie, whom he had married in 1820, died in 1862. They had one son, John Forbes Clark. Sir James Clark died at Bagshot Park in 1870, aged 81, and was buried at Kensal Green.

It features demo recordings made during 1964, before the band became famous. Contents In the Beginning compiles demos, some of which were previously unreleased, that were recorded during 1964 at World Pacific Studios in Los Angeles, before the band had secured a recording contract with Columbia Records. Material dating from the band's pre-fame rehearsal sessions at World Pacific had previously appeared on the 1969 album Preflyte, but In the Beginning provides a more comprehensive overview of this period than the earlier compilation. During preparation for the album, Rhino Records elected to include as many previously unreleased versions of songs as possible, rather than simply duplicate the contents of the Preflyte album. As a result of this, of the seventeen tracks that make up In the Beginning, only five are exactly the same recordings that were included on the earlier compilation album. In the Beginning also includes six alternate takes of songs that appeared on Preflyte. In addition, the album also features alternate versions of both sides of a one-off single that the group released on Elektra Records in 1964 (under the pseudonym of the Beefeaters); a primitive acoustic demo of \\"The Only Girl I Adore\\" which had previously been released on the Early LA various artists compilation; a previously unreleased early version of \\"It's No Use\\"; and two recordings of the previously unreleased song \\"Tomorrow Is a Long Ways Away\\". Noting the album's emphasis on newly released material, the Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan commented that In the Beginning took \\"the brave decision to include as many alternate takes as possible, irrespective of their quality\\", and concluded that the \\"CD captured the very genesis of the Byrds.\\" Music historian and journalist Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, has described the music on the album as \\"excellent, though more tentative and less polished than their 'official' Columbia work.\\" However, Unterberger also complained that \\"some of the alternate takes are inferior to those on the original Preflyte album.\\" Upon release, In the Beginning garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, but failed to reach the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart or the UK Albums Chart. The album is currently out of print and has been supplanted by the two exhaustive double CD compilations, The Preflyte Sessions and Preflyte Plus.

Site of Biddeford High School between 1890 and the 1960s. The first public high school in Biddeford was established in 1848. The building for the high school was erected on Washington Street close to the city's downtown. After a rise in Biddeford's population in the late 19th-century, a new high school was constructed in 1888 on a lot in close-by Alfred Street. The former high school building on Washington Street was then converted to a primary school before being demolished in the 1960s. The high school moved to its new building in 1890. The Alfred Street building suffered a massive fire in 1893 and was promptly rebuilt. A rear annex and gymnasium were added in 1925. The high school moved out of the Alfred Street building in the 1960s to its present location farther away from the Downtown core.  Sports  Biddeford High School football has won 12 football state championships since 1950. The school has a long-standing football rivalry with Saco's Thornton Academy dating to 1893 which is referred to as the \\"Battle of the Bridges\\" by residents of both communities. This is in reference to the multiple bridges which interconnect the two cities over the Saco River.

It was formally described as new to science in 2010, based on specimens found growing in a greenhouse in Botanischer Garten Jena, in Germany. Taxonomy The species was first mentioned by Andreas Gminder in a 2005 publication, who provisionally called it Rhodocybe byssisedoides because of its similarity to the species Entoloma byssisedum. Since that publication, a molecular phylogenetics analysis has shown that Clitopilus is nested within Rhodocybe, and both genera have been subsumed into a broader definition of Clitopilus. Clitopilus byssisedoides was formally described in a 2010 Mycotaxon publication. The authors suggest that it should be classified in the section Claudopodes, of the former genus Rhodocybe, as defined by Timothy J. Baroni in 1981. This infrageneric grouping of species is characterized by stipes that are either absent or laterally attached to the cap, and pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) lacking brightly colored pigments. Description Clitopilus byssisedoides was named for its resemblance to Entoloma byssisedum, shown here. The fruit bodies of C. byssisedoides are pleurotoid (referring to gilled mushrooms with off-center stipes that grow on wood), and attached to its substrate with distinct rhizomorphs. The cap is convex, and the margin is wavy and rolled inward, so that each of the individual caps is shell-shaped. The caps attain diameters of up to The color is grayish and the surface smooth and hygrophanous, and partially translucent, so that the outlines of the gills can be seen. The gills are moderately distantly spaced, and initially creamy- gray before turning dark ochre with age. The mushrooms are sessile, lacking a distinct stipe. The mushroom flesh is very thin, and has a watery grayish- cream color. The spores are elliptical to pip-shaped, slightly thick-walled, and covered with isolated bumps and ridges. When viewed in profile under a light microscope they appear weakly angular, and have dimensions of 5.5–7 by 4–4.5 µm. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning the spore walls will readily absorb Methyl blue stain. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are four-spored and measure 15–32 by 5–9 µm. The gill edge is fertile, and lacks cystidia. The cap cuticle is a compact cutis (characterized by hyphae that are repent, that is, running parallel to the cap surface) of narrow (2–6 µm wide), cylindrical hyphae, gradually passing into cap tissue with incrusted pigment. The cap flesh is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring 4–12 µm wide. Clamp connections are absent. Habitat and distribution Clitopilus byssisedoides was found growing on decayed wood in pot with Phalaenopsis (Orchidaceae) in a tropical hothouse in the Jena Botanical Garden. The authors suggest the species is likely of tropical origin.

The chest is among the few surviving contemporaneous depictions of those historically significant events.  History  The Chest was discovered around 1905 in the village of Stanton St John, a village largely owned by New College, Oxford. Found by Warden of the College William Archibald Spooner (of Spoonerism fame) on a 'Warden’s Progress', it was in a barn of a College tenant where it was used as a feed bin! New College, University of Oxford, Treasures and Chattels: http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/courtrai-chestEarly Furniture-I. Coffers by Aymer Vallance, The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, June 1912, volume 21, issue 111, pages 153–161. Nothing is apparently known of the Chest's 600-year journey from Flanders to Oxford.Flanders became the major European centre of flax production and the linen industry in the Middle Ages. English linen merchants were regular visitors and occasional residents there, so one of them is possibly the route by which the Chest was obtained and taken to England.  Description  The Chest surround is a 17th-century construction, but the carved front-face is the Flemish original, measuring 102 cm by 71 cm, dating from the 14th century.Carved Chest at New College, Oxford by Charles Ffoulkes, The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, July 1912, volume 21, issue 112, pages 240–1 The carving illustrates scenes (below) from the Bruges Matins and the Battle of the Golden Spurs. Fought in Kortrijk (Fr. Courtrai), Flanders, on 11 July 1302, the battle was a citizens’ uprising against the French, King Philip IV of France having annexed Flanders some years before. The battle secured an unexpected victory for the Flemish artisan footmen against the army of French knights. An image of the Courtrai Chest at New College, Oxford, can be found on their website. The image below shows the full-sized reconstruction of the original chest, on display at the 'Kortrijk 1302' museum in Belgium, where it is known as 'De Kist van Oxford': centre  Significance  The victory (and thus the Chest) marks an important historical and cultural reference point for the people of Flanders and is commemorated as an official holiday, 'Feestdag van Vlaanderen', by the Flemish Community in Belgium. The battle demonstrated, possibly for the first time, the ability of foot-soldiers to defeat armed mounted knights; a fact that changed the composition, tactics and cost of European armed forces over the following century.Rogers, Clifford J. (1999). The Age of the Hundred Years War. In Keen, Maurice. Medieval Warfare: A History (Reprint ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press. . The Chest is consequently of significant interest to military historians.  Location  The Chest is on deposit at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, where it can be seen in the Medieval gallery. A fine reproduction of the Chest's carving is kept on display at the Kortrijk1302 museum, where it is known as the 'Chest of Oxford', as part of an extensive exhibition of artefacts concerning the 1302 battle.Kortrijk 1302 Museum http://www.kortrijk1302.be/, Kortrijk 1302, Begijnhofpark z/n, 8500 Kortrijk.

Prior to the Protestant Reformation, the school focused on Latin literature. The first teachers were hired from Sárospatak, but the school was not part of the Kollegium of Sárospatak. The number of the students increased during the next decades and there was a need for a new building. However, the school was closed after Rákóczi's War for Independence (1703–1711). The Patent of Toleration under Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, issued in 1782, insured freedom of religion, and the school was re-established. In 1839 Hungarian was chosen as the tutorial language of the institution. An additional building was completed by 1898, but during the World Wars teaching was conducted in other buildings. In the middle of the 20th century all schools were nationalized, including the Lévay József Grammar School, and the building was used to house a different school.

It is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The building was completed in 1936 and served historically as a courthouse and as a government office building. It is located at 511 East San Antonio Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Significance The Courthouse gives the Federal Government a strong, tangible presence in downtown El Paso. Designed and built in the mid-1930s the building is similar in size, style and construction to government buildings of this era across the country. The architects were Percy McGhee, Guy L. Frazer, and Thomas P. Lippincott.Federal Judicial Center Historic Federal Courthouses page. The Neo-Classical Revival facades and durable materials of the blocklike exterior communicate the importance of the functions housed therein to the citizens of the community. The government commissioned artist Thomas C. Lea, III to paint a mural (Pass of the North) in the courthouse in 1938. The basic plan layout is also fairly typical for buildings of this size and era, with spaces configured between and around two large interior courtyards. This arrangement provides light and air to interior rooms, in a way appropriate to the hot, dry climate of Southwest Texas. Originally designed to house two Courts along with offices for related branches of government, growth of the Courts has generated most of the plan changes over time. As of 2010, there were seven courtrooms in the U.S. Courthouse, with an eighth in the planning stage. Architectural description Courthouse in 1936 The United States Courthouse is a rectilinear Neo-Classical Revival composition with Art Deco influences. The plan is rectangular and biaxially symmetrical with respect to the exterior facades, except for a service door on the west side. Rooms are for the most part arranged on either side of an interior corridor around two Light Courts. The elevations are composed of a flat fossilized limestone base, repetitive limestone pilasters separated by windows and a windowless limestone architrave with terra cotta ornament and coping concealing the fifth floor and a flat roof. The dressed stone base extends from grade to the first floor window sill height, where tall casement windows are spanned with limestone panels. The second, third and fourth floor double hung windows are treated as a continuous vertical element between pilasters separated by cast aluminum spandrels. The windowless fifth floor was designed and built with skylights which have now been abandoned. On the facades outside this level the stone architrave is set off with a repeating stylized eagle terra cotta frieze. The fluted pilasters run between the base and architrave, and have no base or capital of their own. The exterior of the building has been largely unaltered with the exception of a limestone faced ramp added for the handicapped. This ramp is compatible with the original building, if less well detailed. Inside the Courthouse additions and alterations have been generally less sensitive. The East Light Court has been enclosed at the first level to accommodate a new courtroom. A second large courtroom was added on the second floor at the west end, two floors below one of the two original courts. These spaces have no historical significance but are adequate and appropriate for their new use. Three other courts have been added to the building, which are of insufficient size and deficient shape for their purpose. Except for the Clerk's Office, functions not directly tied to the Courtrooms have been relocated to renovated spaces, lessening the logic and integrity of the building. Much of the usable basement level has been sacrificed to accommodate hvac ductwork, while the remainder is in original condition. The first floor has been altered to an extent but retains much of its original details and finishes. Almost all of the wood and glass partitions that defined interior spaces and determined their character have been replaced by gypsum board walls. The main public spaces have been best preserved on this level, including the south lobby with its large, important mural across the north wall. The second and third floors retain little of their original character, but the fourth floor retains in largely unaltered form its two courtrooms and its public spaces. The fifth floor was originally toplit and used for storage and a laboratory. With the skylights closed off, it is now dark and confining, housing two Immigration Courts and their related functions. Throughout the building most of the terrazzo flooring, Art Deco hardware, paneled doors with transoms and period light fixtures are still in place.

United States, 564 U.S. 211 (2011), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that individuals, just like states, may have standing to raise Tenth Amendment challenges to a federal law. The issue arose in the prosecution of an individual under the federal Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act for a local assault that used a chemical irritant. The defendant argued, in part, that the application of the law violated the Constitution's federalism limitations on the statutory implementation of treaties by Congress. Having decided the defendant could bring the constitutional challenge, the Court remanded the case without deciding the merits of the claims. Background After the husband of Carol A. Bond of Lansdale, Pennsylvania, impregnated Myrlinda Haynes, Bond told Haynes, \\"I am going to make your life a living hell.\\" Carol Bond stole the poisonous chemical: 10-chlorophenox arsine from her employer (Rohm and Haas) and purchased potassium dichromate from the internet. Bond smeared the chemicals on doorknobs, car doors, and the mailbox. Haynes suffered a chemical burn on her thumb. Bond was indicted for stealing mail and for violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998. Her appeal argued that applying the chemical weapons treaty to her violated the Tenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals found Bond lacked standing to make a Tenth Amendment claim. Decision The Supreme Court concluded unanimously that Bond had standing to argue that a federal statute enforcing the Chemical Weapons Convention in that instance intruded on areas of police power reserved to the states. Justice Kennedy reasoned that actions exceeding the federal government's enumerated powers undermine the sovereign interests of the states. Individuals seeking to challenge such actions are subject to Article III and prudential standing rules, but if the litigant is a party to an otherwise-justiciable case or controversy, the litigant is not forbidden to object that the injury results from disregard of the federal structure of American government. The Court expressed no view on the merits of Bond's challenge to the federal statute and remanded the case to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Subsequent history The Third Circuit, on remand, found that the Supreme Court's decision gave Bond standing to raise federalism questions about the federal government's power to enforce legislation that implements a treaty. However, the circuit court found the 1920 Supreme Court precedent Missouri v. Holland made the legislation indisputably valid since the treaty is valid. The case then returned to the Supreme Court in Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844 (2014) in which it ruled that since the Implementation Act did not reach her conduct, the Court declined to address the constitutional issue. See also * Reid v.

The release was created by the organizers of Record Store Day to bring customers into independent record shops for holiday shopping. A limited number of 5,000 EPs were produced, and were released on Black Friday in 2010, mostly to record shops in North America. The EP features three live tracks on a 12-inch vinyl record, taken from three different concerts during the U2 360° Tour in 2009 and 2010. The EP comprises the songs \\"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\\", \\"Moment of Surrender\\", and \\"Mercy\\", the latter a previously unreleased track that was debuted on tour. Background and release The potential release of an EP was first announced by U2 bassist Adam Clayton in an August 2010 U2.com video, after stating that the band was not yet ready to release another album. In mid-October, listings for the EP appeared on Amazon.com, with a release date of 22 November. Details of the release were officially announced on 26 October with the track listing and release date information, along with details about its exclusive release to independent record stores, despite its listing on Amazon.com. U2.com officially announced the release on 16 November, and \\"Moment of Surrender\\" from the release was streamed on the website exclusively for the site's subscribers, beginning the following the day. On the day of the EP's release, U2.com streamed all three tracks for the site's subscribers for a 48-hour period. The EP originated with the creators of Record Store Day as an exclusive release as part of the \\"Back to Black Friday\\" program along with over 30 releases from other artists. The program's objective was to draw customers to independent record shops on Black Friday and throughout the 2010 holiday shopping season, as opposed to big-box stores and shopping malls. The EP was released by Interscope Records on 26 November 2010, exclusively for independent record shops in the North America, with a select number of copies available in Europe. U2.com stated copies would be available in the United Kingdom and Ireland, although the London newspaper Daily Mail reported that it was only available at Tower Records in Dublin. The release was limited to 5,000 copies, all of which were individually numbered, although some pressings had higher numbers, as jackets damaged during the manufacturing process were destroyed and reprinted with newer numbers. An owner of a Milwaukee, Wisconsin store compared ordering the EP to a roulette, and said he \\"ordered 15 [copies] hoping to get 6\\". Twenty of the copies were given away in a December 2010 sweepstakes for U2.com site subscribers. Pre-orders for the EP were available from online retailer The Ideal Copy, but had sold out by the end of October, almost a month prior to the release. New Jersey-based retailer Vintage Vinyl Records described the EP as an \\"Indie-Exclusive Black Friday item\\", and also sold pre-orders online, but had ended pre-orders early to ensure copies were available for Black Friday. On the day of its release, several record shops in the US reported Wide Awake in Europe as one of their best-sellers. The EP was sold for around US$10–20, but copies were selling on eBay the following day for $75. Content The three live tracks on the EP were recorded during the U2 360° Tour in 2009 and 2010. The title and cover of the EP are references to U2's 1985 EP Wide Awake in America. All the tracks were recorded by Alastair McMillan, and mixed by the EP's producer, Declan Gaffney. Side A of the record features \\"Mercy\\", which was debuted during the U2 360° Tour in September 2010. Previously, \\"Mercy\\" had leaked online as a track from the sessions for U2's 2004 album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, but Wide Awake in Europe was the first official release of the song. The performance included on the EP is taken from band's concert in Brussels during the month of its debut, and was the fourth-ever live performance of the song. Side B features performances of \\"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\\" (from Dublin in July 2009) and \\"Moment of Surrender\\" (from Paris in September 2010), both of which are from U2's 2009 studio album, No Line on the Horizon. The EP's live version of the \\"I'll Go Crazy\\" live remix from Dublin was previously released on the 2009 U2.com member-exclusive remix album, Artificial Horizon, and was remixed by Redanka and Dirty South. The track also features a clip of \\"Beshno Az Ney/Windfall\\" by Sussan Deyhim. In a review published by Sputnikmusic two weeks after Wide Awake in Europe release, critic Irving Tan praised the EP, stating how \\"Mercy\\" was \\"the biggest treat to fans\\", while the \\"I'll Go Crazy\\" remix gives the EP a \\"party vibe\\", and that \\"Moment of Surrender\\" \\"manages to be hopeful, glorious, and resplendent all at once\\". Tan concluded by saying that the EP sends a message of the band's \\"youthful defiance\\" and stated that he looks forward to U2's fourth decade.

History The hunt was formed by the merger of three separate foxhound packs: the Old Surrey, the Burstow and the West Kent. The first recorded pack on the Surrey country was in 1735 at Lovells Grove, Croydon, where the Earl of Onslow lived, and by 1800 a merchant pack was hunting the country. In 1808 is found the first evidence of the Old Surrey pack, based in Godstone, and retaining the merchant membership. The Burstow pack dates from around 1866, having previously been a harrier pack. Having been originally based at Poundhill, the pack moved to Felbridge in 1909. In 1915, the Old Surrey and Burstow hunts amalgamated, and took the Felbridge base of the Burstow as their home. The West Kent hunt dates back to 1776, and did not join with the Old Surrey and Burstow until 1999. Hunt Country The hunt covers three territories, as a result of the merger of the three former hunts, which gives the hunt a large country, although a large portion is not huntable due to urbanisation, roads and railway lines. The country runs from the M23 motorway in the west to Hadlow in the East, and from the Isle of Grain in the North to Fletching in the south. The hunt's best centres are Edenbridge, Horsted Keynes, Penshurst and Mereworth. Pony Club The hunt is linked to branches of The Pony Club including an Old Surrey and Burstow Branch.

Claims that someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works traditionally attributed to him were first explicitly made in the 19th century, though supporters of the theory often argue that coded assertions of alternative authorship exist in texts dating back to Shakespeare's lifetime. Typically, they say that the historical Shakespeare was merely a front to shield the identity of the real author or authors, who, for reasons such as social rank, state security, or gender, could not safely take public credit. Although these claims have attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider them to be fringe theories with no hard evidence, and for the most part disregard them except to rebut or disparage the claims.: \\"Professional Shakespeare scholars mostly pay little attention to it, much as evolutionary biologists ignore creationists and astronomers dismiss UFO sightings.\\"; quotes James Shapiro: \\"There's no documentary evidence linking their 50 or so candidates to the plays.\\"; quotes Gail Kern Paster, director of the Folger Shakespeare Library: \\"To ask me about the authorship question ... is like asking a paleontologist to debate a creationist's account of the fossil record.\\" argues however in an anti-Stratfordian on-line journal that: \\"while Oxfordians have sometimes attacked the academy for ignoring them, the fact is, on the whole, that 'mainstream' Shakespeare scholarship has shown more interest in Oxfordianism than Oxfordians have shown in 'mainstream' Shakespearean scholarship.\\"; : \\"I do not know of a single professor of the 1,300-member Shakespeare Association of America who questions the identity of Shakespeare ... Among editors of Shakespeare in the major publishing houses, none that I know questions the authorship of the Shakespeare canon.\\"; : \\"I am an academic, a member of what is called the 'Shakespeare Establishment,' one of perhaps 20,000 in our land, professors mostly, who make their living, more or less, by teaching, reading, and writing about Shakespeare—and, some say, who participate in a dark conspiracy to suppress the truth about Shakespeare.... I have never met anyone in an academic position like mine, in the Establishment, who entertained the slightest doubt as to Shakespeare's authorship of the general body of plays attributed to him. Like others in my position, I know there is an anti-Stratfordian point of view and understand roughly the case it makes. Like St. Louis, it is out there, I know, somewhere, but it receives little of my attention.\\"; The basis for these theories can be traced to the 18th century, when, more than 150 years after his death, Shakespeare's status was elevated to that of the greatest writer of all time.; Shakespeare’s pre-eminence seemed incongruous with his humble origins and obscure life, arousing suspicion that he was not the author of the works attributed to him.; ; : \\"By the middle of the 19th century, the Authorship Controversy was an accident waiting to happen. In the wake of Romanticism, especially its German variants, such transcendent, quasi-religious claims were being made for the supreme poetic triumph of the Complete Works that it was becoming well-nigh impossible to imagine how any mere human being could have written them all. At the same time the popular understanding of what levels of cultural literacy might have been achieved in 16th-century Stratford was still heavily influenced by a British tradition of Bardolatry (best exemplified by David Garrick's Shakespeare Jubilee) which had its own nationalist reasons for representing Shakespeare as an uninstructed son of the English soil …\\" At the same time, the influence of biblical higher criticism led some authors to take the view that Shakespeare's works could be the product of the collaborative efforts of many authors. Public debate and a prolific body of literature date from the mid-19th century, and numerous historical figures, including Francis Bacon, the Earl of Oxford, Christopher Marlowe and the Earl of Derby, have since been nominated as the true author.: Promoters of various authorship theories assert that their particular candidate is more plausible in terms of education, life experience, and/or social status to be the true author of the Shakespeare canon. Most candidates are either members of the upper social classes or are known poets and playwrights of the day. Proponents argue that the documented life of William Shakespeare lacks the education, aristocratic sensibility, or familiarity with the royal court which they say is apparent in the works.: \\"These two notions—that the Shakespeare canon represented the highest achievement of human culture, while William Shakespeare was a completely uneducated rustic—combined to persuade Delia Bacon and her successors that the Folio’s title page and preliminaries could only be part of a fabulously elaborate charade orchestrated by some more elevated personage, and they accordingly misread the distinctive literary traces of Shakespeare’s solid Elizabethan grammar-school education visible throughout the volume as evidence that the 'real' author had attended Oxford or Cambridge.\\" Mainstream Shakespeare scholars maintain that biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable for attributing authorship,: \\"in voicing dissatisfaction over the apparent lack of continuity between the certain facts of Shakespeare’s life and the spirit of his literary output, anti-Stratfordians adopt the very Modernist assumption that an author’s work must reflect his or her life. Neither Shakespeare nor his fellow Elizabethan writers operated under this assumption.\\"; : \\"Perhaps the point is that deriving an idea of an author from his or her works is always problematic, particularly in a multi-vocal genre like drama, since it crucially underestimates the heterogeneous influences and imaginative reaches of creative writing. Often the authorship debate is premised on the syllogistic and fallacious interchangeability of literature and autobiography.\\"; writes of \\"the junk scholarship that so unhappily defaces the authorship issue\\"; quotes James Shapiro: \\"Once you take away the argument that the life can be found in the works, those who don't believe Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare don't have any argument left.\\" and that the convergence of documentary evidence for Shakespeare’s authorship—title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians and official records—is the same as that for any other author of the time. No such supporting evidence exists for any other candidate,: \\"The problem that confronts all such attempts is that they have to dispose of the many testimonies from Will the player’s own time that he was regarded as the author of the plays and the absence of any clear contravening public claims of the same nature for any of the other favoured candidates.\\"; and Shakespeare’s authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after his death.: \\"No one in Shakespeare’s lifetime or the first two hundred years after his death expressed the slightest doubt about his authorship.\\"; : \\". . . no suspicions regarding Shakespeare's authorship (except for a few mainly humorous comments) were expressed until the middle of the nineteenth century (in Hart's The Romance of Yachting, 1848). For over two hundred years no one had any serious doubts.\\" Despite the scholastic consensus,: \\"Most observers, however, have been more impressed by the anti-Stratfordians' dogged immunity to documentary evidence, not only that which confirms that Shakespeare wrote his own plays, but that which establishes that several of the alternative candidates were long dead before he had finished doing so.\\" a relatively small but highly visible and diverse assortment of supporters, including some prominent public figures, are confident that someone other than William Shakespeare wrote the works attributed to him.: \\"the astonishing hypotheses generated by the endlessly fertile brains of anti-Stratfordians.\\" They campaign to gain public acceptance of the authorship question as a legitimate field of academic inquiry and to promote one or another of the various authorship candidates through publications, organizations, online discussion groups and conferences.

It is listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties and on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic district is where the city's middle and upper- income German community lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Germans were the largest ethnic group to settle in Davenport. Description Ripley Street steps Hamburg is located to the northwest of Davenport's central business district. The neighborhood itself goes as far north as Locust Street and to the west as far as Division Street. with The historic district's boundaries were reduced to the section between Fifth and Ninth (south to north) and Ripley and Vine (east to west). It includes the highest concentration of historic buildings and some of the best examples of architectural styles in the neighborhood. The Mississippi River is located five blocks to the south. There is a gradual slope to the land as one travels to the north. After the alley north of Fifth Street, it dramatically rises into a bluff. It peaks at about Seventh Street and descends less dramatically to Ninth Street. The southern part of this area provides a prominent view of the cityscape and the river. For this reason, it became a prime location for the middle and upper-income Germans who immigrated to Davenport to build their homes. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad tracks built along Fifth Street are yet another boundary for the area. The north side of Sixth Street (along the bluff line) that extends from Ripley Street to Gaines Street is known as the \\"Gold Coast.\\" History US German population in 1872. Davenport is in the center of the dark band along the Mississippi River in Eastern Iowa German immigrants started moving into the city in noticeable numbers starting in the late 1840s. In 1848, 250 Germans came to Davenport and by 1850, that number rose to close to 3,000, or 20% of the city's population. German immigration remained strong through the 1880s. The Iowa census of 1890 showed that a quarter of Scott County's residents were natives of Germany. A disproportionate number of those immigrants came from Schleswig-Holstein, which was in a border and personal rights dispute with Denmark in the 1840s. German “free thinkers” from the two states were leaving in large numbers and many came to Davenport. Their political and philosophical thinking tended to be anti-clerical and secular. It would eventually dominate Davenport politics and set the city apart from communities of similar size in the Midwest. Other German immigrants to Davenport came from Bavaria, Hamburg, Hanover, and Mecklenburg. Davenport's small Hungarian community, refugees from the revolution against Austria in the 1840s, generally lived in the German neighborhoods, as well.Svendsen, 1.10 The former German Methodist Episcopal Church Initially, the native-born citizens of Davenport resented the large numbers of Germans coming to the city and the influence they were asserting. They were also opposed to separate German societies, schools, cultural organizations, and events. Supporting the Temperance movement was one way opponents expressed anti-German sentiments. In 1855, the Know Nothing movement emerged with the goal of keeping local politics to native-born people. By the end of the Civil War, with the sons of both Germans and non-Germans dying for a common cause, there was a sense of acceptance even though the numbers of Germans coming into the city continued to increase.Roba, 78 Because of the size of Davenport's German population, their customs dominated the city's economic, cultural, and political life. Many of those who were leaders in civic life lived in the Hamburg District.Svendsen, 17.1 The lower income Germans tended to live below the hill and above the factories along the Mississippi River. Their neighborhoods are collectively known as the West End, although they were not all German, and included the West Third Street Historic District. Harrison Street is generally the dividing line between the Germans on the west and the non-Germans on the east side. German influence in Davenport started to wane in the early decades of the 20th century, especially with the onset of World War I. The war, coupled with the younger generation's lack of a distinct German identity, led to the decline of German influence. Henry Lischer House Prominent Davenport citizens who lived in the Hamburg District included Henry Lischer, who published the influential German-language newspaper Der Demokrat; merchants August Steffen and his son August as well as F. Max D. Peterson, who was a partner in the J.H.C. Petersen's Sons' Store; brewers Henry Frahm and Henry Koehler; the Mueller's who owned a large lumber mill; H.H. Andressen who founded the German Savings Bank, which was later renamed American Commercial and Savings Bank; politician and German-American leader Hans Reimer Clausen; grocer Charles Beiderbecke; and financier William H. Weise. All of the above-named men had roots in Schleswig-Holstein, they built significant houses in the Hamburg District, and many of their children married a son or daughter from one of the other's families. Architecture Charles Beiderbecke House The geographical location of the Hamburg District is a fairly steep bluff north of the downtown area. The sidewalk on Ripley Street is replaced by steps as it climbs the hill. The area has the largest concentration of historically significant houses in Davenport. As with other areas of the city, the simple Greek Revival style was the first to appear in Hamburg. These homes are generally at the base of the hill. The style is realized in cottages and the more popular two-story, 3-bay front gable homes. Other homes in the district include large Victorian homes in the Gothic Revival, Second Empire, Italianate, and the Queen Anne styles built in the 19th century. Many of these homes crown the bluff and offer vistas overlooking the river valley below. There are also examples of early 20th century Georgian Revival and American Craftsman homes. The historic district is rounded out by smaller and more simple late 19th and early 20th century homes and a few modern dwellings. The Hamburg Historic District is largely a residential area today. Institutional architecture that existed has largely been torn down or converted to residential use. One such building on West Seventh Street was built for Iowa College, which moved from the area in the 1850s to the present College Square Historic District.Svendsen, 17.3 The former German Methodist Episcopal Church remains on West Sixth Street, while Zion and Trinity Lutheran Churches built new buildings outside of the district in the mid-20th century. Many civic, cultural, religious, and commercial buildings that served the German citizens of the city were not built in the Hamburg District. Contributing Properties Deidrich J.

Together with the Matimekosh Reserve, it belongs to the Innu Nation of Matimekush-Lac John. It is geographically within the Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality but administratively not part of it. The reserve is named after the adjacent John Lake. That name was assigned by the Labrador Mining and Smelting Company, which used it on one of its geological maps a little before 1947. History The region was the northern limit of the hunting and trapping grounds of the Innu indigenous people, but they never had resided there permanently. Because of mining development in the early 1950s, the Naskapi from Fort Chimo and a dozen Innu families from Maliotenam arrived at Schefferville to serve as guides for geological exploration work, and help on the railway construction from Sept-Iles. In 1957, the Schefferville municipal authorities moved the Innu and Naskapi to a site on John Lake, where they lived in poverty without sanitation, electricity, schools, or a medical facility. A year later, the site was surveyed for the creation of a reserve. On June 7, 1960, the Government of Québec transferred to the Government of Canada that then formed the Lac-John Reserve. The Innu and Naskapi initially lived in tiny shacks, but by 1962 Indian and Northern Affairs had built 30 houses for them.Natural Resources Canada - Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review - Lac John land title history Following the creation of the Matimekosh Reserve close to the town's centre in 1968, the municipality of Schefferville tried to annex the Lac-John Reserve. In 1972, most of the families on the Lac-John Reserve moved to Matimekosh, but a group of them decided to stay and new residences were built for them in 1975.

He and his sons intermittently represented County Roscommon in the Parliament of Ireland and the United Kingdom Parliament. He was able to transform his support of the Union of Great Britain and Ireland into a peerage, but was frustrated in his subsequent desire to become a viscount. Mahon was the son of Thomas Mahon and Hon. Jane, daughter of Maurice Crosbie, 1st Baron Brandon, and Lady Elizabeth Fitzmaurice. He was born in Strokestown. On 17 June 1765, he married Hon. Catherine (died March 1834), daughter of Stephen Moore, 1st Viscount Mount Cashell and Alicia Colville. They had three sons: Thomas (1766–1835), Stephen (1768–1828), and Maurice (1772–1845). Maurice's father Thomas died in 1782, and Maurice succeeded to the family's Strokestown estate. The Mahons were one of several important electoral interests in Roscommon, and Maurice was able to succeed his father as one of the representatives for County Roscommon in the Irish Parliament. However, he lost the seat to Arthur French, of French Park, in 1783. Mahon was eager to be created a peer, and the widespread bribery preceding the Union provided him with an opportunity. When Viscount Kingsborough succeeded his father as Earl of Kingston in 1799 and triggered a by-election for County Roscommon, Mahon saw an opportunity. The King family's preferred candidate, Hon. Robert King, opposed the Union, and Mahon got the support of the administration by promising them a pro-Union vote. With their help, Mahon won the support of the Catholic and independent interests of the county for his eldest son Thomas, who had recently defended Carlow during the Rebellion of 1798. King ultimately stood down before the poll, and Thomas took the Roscommon seat. However, the Roscommon electors were implacably anti- Union, and Thomas absented himself from Parliament rather than vote for or against the Union. Maurice was forced to buy a seat at Knocktopher for his younger son Stephen to carry out his obligations to the administration. The stratagem worked: Stephen voted for the Union, and on 30 July 1800, Maurice was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Hartland, of Strokestown in the County of Roscommon, as a reward for his support. The administration still wished to conciliate the powerful King family, and without their support, Thomas did not stand for Roscommon in the 1802 election. In the 1806 election, Hartland put forth his younger son Stephen for Roscommon, at a cost of £1,696 18s. in election expenses; he made a strong showing and the Kings conceded without a poll, to the administration's displeasure. Stephen continued to support government on Hartland's instructions, his object being to secure a further promotion to a viscount in the Irish peerage. He was not successful in this, although Stephen did not go into opposition until shortly after his father's death. Hartland died on 4 January 1819, aged 80, and was succeeded in the barony by his son, Thomas.

Not very durable unless exactingly maintained, it was soon replaced by other designs. It consisted of a rigidly mounted axle beam from which the sprung steering and suspension arms pivoted around kingpins mounted on the ends of the axle. The wheels themselves were mounted onto stub axles, suspended by self-contained suspension units outboard of the kingpins. The system featured an encased coil spring and shock absorber, which sealed in the oil needed to lubricate and protect the suspension parts. This was also the weakness of the layout, as any leaks would have negative effects on ride and durability. Front right suspension unit (forward direction to the bottom right) One advantage for a comfortable ride was the reduction in unsprung weight, as the kingpins and steering gear were inboard of the suspension, and not thus counted as sprung mass. This in turn led to 'synchronous' behaviour in many cars with this suspension, where the natural frequency of the front wheel suspension now, unusually for the time, matched that of the rear suspension and their solid driving axle. The mass of the driving axle was greater but with the now softer springs of the lightweight front suspension, Thus both a lower mass and softer springs together still give the same frequency. }} their frequencies became comparable. This was a feature of Opel patents and advertising in the 1930s. Dubonnet's own Hispano- Suiza H6B Dubonnet Xenia The system was invented by French engineer and designer André Dubonnet and (heir to the Dubonnet vermouth fortune), and built into his Hispano-Suiza based special of 1933. He sold it to General Motors who adapted it as their \\"Knee-action ride\\", but the system was also used by many others including Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Simca, and, possibly in its last incarnation, the 1953 Iso Isetta which carried forward to the 1955 BMW Isetta, the 1957 BMW 600 and the 1959 BMW 700. The General Motors connection led to one of the suspension's most numerous uses, with a return to Europe for the pre-war Vauxhall Twelve and Vauxhall Fourteen from 1935 to 1938. The post- war Vauxhall Velox of 1949 reintroduced a similar trailing arm suspension which is widely described as 'Dubonnet' suspension. However this suspension used torsion bars rather than coil springs and so Vauxhall themselves denied that this was the 'true' Dubonnet.

It is under investigation as a viable alternative to conventional photovoltaic cells. Lonnie Johnson invented it and claims the converter exhibits an energy conversion efficiency of as much as 60% compared to the 30% efficiency typical of the best photovoltaic cells; however, this claim is at a theoretical level based on comparison with a Carnot cycle and assumes a temperature gradient of 600 °C. It was originally proposed for funding to the Office of Naval Research but was refused. Johnson obtained later funding by framing the engine as a hydrogen fuel cell. Johnson is collaborating with PARC on development of the engine. Mechanism of action The JTEC converts heat into electrical energy by compressing and expanding hydrogen gas. It operates as a closed system with no moving classical mechanical parts, requires no input of fuel, and creates no exhaust. The engine consists of two stages: A low-temperature compression stage and a high-temperature power stage. Each stage consists of a working fluid chamber that a copper lined membrane electrode assembly (MEA) bisects. A MEA is a proprietary ceramic proton exchange membrane (PEM) that is sandwiched between two electrodes. In the high-temperature power stage, expanding high pressure hydrogen from the compression stage converts the heat energy into electrical energy via the MEA. As the high-temperature, high pressure hydrogen is forced through the PEM it is ionized, producing protons and electrons. The protons pass through the membrane while the electrodes expel the electrons through a load. After passing through the PEM, the protons recombine with the electrons to produce low pressure hydrogen gas that flows out to the compression stage. From the perspective of the high-temperature stage, the load consists of the external load on the engine and the low-temperature compression stage. In the compression stage, electrical potential is applied across the MEA and forces protons to flow through the PEM to produce high pressure hydrogen. As the hydrogen travels between the stages, it passes through a heat exchanger that increases efficiency by helping to keep the high-temperature stage hot and the low-temperature stage cool. The amount of energy available to the external load is the difference in electrical potential between that needed to compress hydrogen at low-temperature and that which expanding it at high temperature generates. Unlike other heat pump devices, the JTEC requires an initial input of electrical energy to start the compression stage and initiate the cycle. The engine can also be operated in reverse to convert electrical energy into a temperature differential, for example in HVAC applications. In the proposed application, solar irradiance would heat the power stage, and the compression stage would connect to an ambient temperature heat sink. Applications The scalability of the engine leads its developers to claim that its potential applications range from providing power for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to functioning as large-scale power plants. The converter can use many diverse forms of fuel without the need for fuel-specific customization as seen in internal combustion engines, and can generate power from fuel combustion, solar irradiance, low grade waste heat from industry, or such other power generation systems as fuel cells, internal combustion engines, or turbines, because it functions as an external combustion engine.

A left-handed pitcher, LeMay appeared in parts of three Major League Baseball seasons (1961–63), but had a long career in minor league baseball. He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and graduated from Withrow High School. LeMay attended the University of Michigan, stood tall and weighed . He signed with the San Francisco Giants in 1958 and was recalled from the minor leagues during the 1961 season, appearing in 27 games for the Giants that season, starting five. He dropped six of nine decisions and recorded an earned run average of 3.56 and one complete game in 83⅓ innings pitched. He had nine-game trials with the 1962 Giants and the 1963 Chicago Cubs, and was winless in two decisions. All told he won three games, lost eight and had a career ERA of 4.17 in 45 Major League games. In 108 innings pitched, he surrendered 100 hits and 49 bases on balls. He struck out 69, and was credited with four saves. In his lone MLB complete game, on June 24, 1961, at Busch Stadium, he defeated the St. Louis Cardinals, 6–1, allowing six hits; future Baseball Hall of Famer Bob Gibson took the loss. After he returned to minor league baseball in 1963, LeMay had a successful career as a starting pitcher at the Triple-A level through 1970, reaching the double digits in wins for six consecutive seasons, including 17- and 16-victory seasons in 1965 and 1968. All told, he won 139 games and lost 124 as a minor league pitcher. LeMay also managed at the Class A level in the Cubs' farm system in 1971–72 and was a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1970s and the Montréal Expos during the 1980s.

Toida: \\"A note on Adam's conjecture\\", Journal of Combinatorial Theory (B), pp. 239–246, October–December 1977 is a refinement of the disproven Ádám's conjecture from 1967. Statement Both conjectures concern circulant graphs. These are graphs defined from a positive integer n and a set S of positive integers. Their vertices can be identified with the numbers from 0 to n-1, and two vertices i and j are connected by an edge whenever their difference modulo n belongs to set S. Every symmetry of the cyclic group of addition modulo n gives rise to a symmetry of the n-vertex circulant graphs, and Ádám conjectured (incorrectly) that these are the only symmetries of the circulant graphs. However, the known counterexamples to Ádám's conjecture involve sets S in which some elements share non-trivial divisors with n. Toida's conjecture states that, when every member of S is relatively prime to n, then the only symmetries of the circulant graph for n and S are symmetries coming from the underlying cyclic group. Proofs The conjecture was proven in the special case where n is a prime power by Klin and Poschel in 1978,Klin, M.H. and R. Poschel: The Konig problem, the isomorphism problem for cyclic graphs and the method of Schur rings, Algebraic methods in graph theory, Vol. I, II., Szeged, 1978, pp. 405–434. and by Golfand, Najmark, and Poschel in 1984.Golfand, J.J., N.L. Najmark and R. Poschel: The structure of S-rings over Z2m , preprint (1984). The conjecture was then fully proven by Muzychuk, Klin, and Poschel in 2001 by using Schur algebra,Klin, M.H., M.

The army was named the Independent Caucasus Army on its creation, and carried this name until August 1923, when it was renamed the Red Banner Caucasus Army. It ceased to exist on May 17, 1935 when it was redesignated as the Transcaucasian Military District in connection with the overall reorganization of the Red Army. The army consisted of 6 territorial divisions, an air force, and some reserve troops. History The army was established at the end of May 1921 from the 11th Army, a unit of the Caucasus Front, which was dissolved on May 29, 1921. The army unified the territorial forces of the Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (but in reality was under the control of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, and later of the Soviet Union). At a meeting of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR on 17 August 1923, it was moved and passed to award the Independent Caucasus Army the Order of the Red Banner and rename it the Red Banner Caucasus Army.Battle exploits of the Red Army (1918-1922) Collection of documents. Moscow: Military Publishing, 1957. 240 pages. Page 195. Units of the Red Banner Caucasus Army, together with units of the OGPU, were involved in fighting partisans, mainly in Chechnya and Dagestan, in the years 1921-1933. Reason for dissolution Amid a perceived increasing threat of armed aggression against the USSR, the old mobilization doctrine and structure of the Red Army was found not optimal for meeting these threats. On May 17, 1935, the military and administrative system of the Red Army was radically changed. Instead of 8 military districts and 2 separate armies, 13 military districts were created: Moscow, Leningrad, Belarus, Kiev, Kharkov, North Caucasus, Transcaucasia, Central Asia, Volga, Urals, Siberia, Transbaikalia, and Far East. In almost all of these new districts the composition of the territorial armies was also changed. Replacing the former distinction between \\"border\\" and \\"interior\\" districts, a new designation of districts as \\"front\\" (combat) or \\"rear\\" (administrative) was made. It was assumed that the \\"front\\" districts would bear the brunt of any fighting, and the \\"rear\\" districts would provide reinforcements and logistical support. For each front district there would be two rear districts.

From 1988 to 1990 he was a front-man of the punk bands «Schnook» («ЧМО») and «Manifesto Committee» («Комитет Манифест»). Between 1990-1991 he took part in the art movement «Expropriation of the Territory of Art» («ЭТИ») together with Anatoly Osmolovsky, Dmitry Pimenov, Grigori Gusarov. From 1993 to 1994 he participated in the art collective Neceziudik («Нецезиудик») together with Alexander Brener, Anatoly Osmolovsky, Dmitry Pimenov, Sendi Revizorov, Alexander Zubarzuk. In 1995, together with the artists Farid Bogdalov, Mavromatti established the art collective «Absolute Love Sect» members of which were also Imperator Wawa, Dmitry Pimenov, Mihail and Tatyana Nikitin, Alena Martynova. The Film Union SUPERNOVA within which Mavromatti has been producing his movies was established by him and Sergej Salnikov in 1995. Other members until 2000 were Sergej Pahomov, Svetlana Baskova, Alexander Maslaev and others. Since 2000 SUPERNOVA productions have been made in Bulgaria and USA, together with artist Boryana Rossa. In 2004 Oleg Mavrmatti and Boryana Rossa established ULTRAFUTURO art collective. Other members are Anton Terziev, Katia Damianova and Miroslav Dimitrov.Кук В. Интервью с Олегом Мавроматти и Боряной Росса // New Media Art Magazine. — 2005. — № 6. The group had made more than 60 performances and public interventions. The work of the group address issues of technology, science and their social and political implications. Works by ULTRAFUTURO were shown at venues such as the Biennial for Electronic Art, Perth (BEAP); Society for Art and Technology (SAT), Montreal; Art Digital at the 2nd Moscow Biennial; Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY; MUMOK, Viena; Zacheta Gallery, Warsaw; RIAP Performance art festival Quebec, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Schenectady Museum, NY and are included in the respected selection Transitland Video Art from central and Eastern Europe 1989-2009.

Oleg Mavromati, performance «Do Not Believe Your Eyes!» On April 1, 2000 at the yard of the Institute of Cultorology in Moscow, Mavromatti shoot a scene of his film «Oil on Canvas». He was a director and an actor in one of the leading roles. The script involved a scene of crucifixion, which later appeared to be controversial for particular fundamentalist formations in the Orthodox Christian Church in Russia.Нехорошев Г. Кого обидел художник // Независимая газета. — 2000. — 13 июля. The story of the film is based on the biography of the young Ukrainian painter Oleg Golosiy, who according to the legend was killed by his best friend. This friend was also an artist, and he committed this crime because of envy. Mavromatti developed the story and added another psychological layer of the character who killed Golosiy. Mavromatti' himself played the role of the killer. According to the script the character repented and in order to prove his sincerity he chose to change the traditional artistic medium he used (paint and canvas) with direct action and physical expression. As a true evidence of his repent the character decided to crucify himself representing an archetype of sacrifice, pain and humiliation. The place where the scene was shot was strategically chosen to be in between the Institute of Cultorology and the temple Christ the Savior. The performance within the film was called «Do Not Believe Your Eyes» and was also meant to address the institutionalization of artistic expression, the commercialization in art and the compromise artists often make with their sincerity, for the sake of money and fame. Several weeks after there was a legal complaint from the chairman of the local Orthodox church community «St. Nikola», a neighbour of the Institute of Culturology and members of the party Russian National Unity against Mavromatti, which was sent back by the Moscow City court, as there was no evidence of crime. Later the same complaint with the help of powerful connections was sent to the General Attorney's Office. Mavromatti's home was searched on 07.07.2000 and all his video and film materials were confiscated. The film “Oil on Canvas” was never finished. Mavromatti was interrogated three times in the special Department of National Religious Matters, by Yurii Krilov. He is persecuted under the article 282 of the Russian Criminal Codex, for «inciting religious animosity» like many other contemporary artists and cultural producers in Russia. Mavromatti is facing 3–5 years of prison. The only remain from the scene is a video tape which was shot separately from the film footage. Later this video became well known as a performance under the name «Do Not Believe Your Eyes!» It was shown internationally at places such as The Museum of Contemporary Art, Denver and is part of the respected monograph «Russian Actionism 1990-2000» by the Russian art historian Andrej Kovalev. In 2000 Mavromatti left Russia and since then he has been living and working in Bulgaria and the US.  On-line Show - a public execution performance \\"Ally/ Foe”  During the Summer of 2010 Mavromatti had re-applied for Russian passport at the Russian consulate in Bulgaria. Mavromatti was informed that because in Russia he is being under Federal investigation under the Article 282, for his performance \\"Do not believe your eyes\\", his passport cannot be extended.Дубровская Н.

The film focuses on the recorded interrogations of Canadian child soldier Omar Khadr, by Canadian intelligence personnel that took place over four days from February 13–16, 2003 while he was held at Guantanamo. It presents these with observations by his lawyers and former cell mates from the Bagram Theater Internment Facility and Guantanamo Bay detention camps. The film premiered at the Festival du nouveau cinéma in Montreal in October 2010. The film was shown to Canadian parliamentarians in October 2010. Khadr's defence attorney's planned to show the film during their summation if Khadr's trial went forward. According to the Montreal Gazette the film-makers Luc Côté and Patricio Henriquez also produced a series of short YouTube videos as a companion to the feature-length documentary. Summary Omar Khadr was taken captive in Pakistan at the age of 15 and ultimately imprisoned at Guantanamo, charged with killing a US soldier. Khadr was finally transferred into Canadian custody in late 2012. He was held in a maximum security prison and transferred in 2014 to a medium-security one. He was released in 2015. Reception Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian, > His unseen interrogator here is a Canadian intelligence officer, evidently > the lead officer in a team, permitted by the Americans to question the > prisoner on the understanding that a friendly seeming fellow countryman > might cause Khadr to open up and give the US valuable intelligence. So far > from being a respite from torture, this insincere friendly chat is a hideous > refinement of cruelty: a horrifying turn of the screw. mirror According to Andrew O'Hehir wrote in Salon, \\"Khadr became a sort of ritual sacrifice by the Canadian government, an offering to its American allies and/or overlords.\\" Sam Kressner wrote in Filmcritic.com:  Awards  The film won the Special Jury Award at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam. The film won an award for \\"best documentary about society\\" at the Prix Gémeaux on September 13, 2011. The film was nominated in the best documentary category for the 2010 Genie awards.

It did not receive a nomination. Politics Shortly before the film's premiere, Canada lost its bid for one of the rotating seats on the United Nations Security Council. According to Rhéal Séguin, writing in The Globe and Mail, the filmmakers \\"are convinced one reason Canada failed to get a seat on the United Nations Security Council was because the federal government has been condemned by many countries for failing to respect Mr. Khadr's human rights and the provisions of the international convention on child soldiers.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Trailer * Full video on TVOntario * Category:2010 films Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:Canadian documentary films Category:2010 documentary films Category:War on Terror Category:Prisoner of war films Category:Documentary films about the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) Category:Documentary films about law in the United States Category:Guantanamo Bay detention camp Category:Canadian prison films ","title":"You Don't Like the Truth"},{"id":"29249456","text":"Fabian Schaar (born 13 March 1989) is a German track and road racing cyclist.

Created by Matt Fraction, Rick Remender, and Howard Chaykin, the character made her first appearance in Punisher War Journal Vol. 2, #20 (August 2008). She is an enemy of the Punisher.  Publication history  Lady Gorgon was introduced Punisher War Journal Vol. 2, #20-21, and reappeared in Franken-Castle #17-18, and Punisher: In the Blood #1-5.  Fictional character biography  A Jōnin of the Hand, Lady Gorgon and her entourage are hired by Jigsaw to assassinate the Punisher for €50,000,000. After having a group of Hand ninja stalk and wound the Punisher, Gorgon and her two partners, Silhouette and Illumination, confront the vigilante, and declare their intent to kill him, and have their masters resurrect him as a servant of the Hand. The ensuing battle between the Punisher and Gorgon is interrupted by S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives Domino, Silver Sable, and Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. While her allies combat the S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Gorgon pursues the Punisher into a flophouse, and draws him out into the open by using her telepathy to make him experience the death of a vagrant whose throat she slits. While overpowering the Punisher, Gorgon is attacked by Silver Sable; due to being distracted by Sable, Gorgon is shot in the head by the Punisher. For failing to assassinate the Punisher, Gorgon was expelled from the Hand. In an attempt to reclaim her honor, Gorgon hires three members of the Shaolin Scientist Squad to help her murder the Punisher, who had since become a Frankenstein's monster-like entity called Franken-Castle. Franken-Castle kills two of the Shaolin Scientist Squad members, while the third is shot in the head from afar by Gorgon to prevent him from being interrogated by Franken-Castle. Gorgon retreats to Tokyo, where she acquires the Izanami-no-Mikoto Sword, a Hand relic that she believes can earn her acceptance back into the organization. Franken-Castle locates Gorgon, and their ensuing battle brings them to the Hand's base in Kabukichō, where Gorgon is impaled with the Izanami-no-Mikoto Sword by her former master, Kazu Yoshiokya. Gorgon again survived, and was approached by Jigsaw and Stuart Clarke, who she allowed to alter her appearance and characteristics (like her voice) so that she could pose as Maria Castle as a part of a plot to kill the Punisher. Gorgon psychologically tortures the Punisher by pretending to be Maria, and later tries to kill him with a flamethrower in Jigsaw's lair. The Punisher surrenders, unable to fight what he believes to be his wife, until he is informed by his ally, Henry, that the woman is an imposter. In a rage, the Punisher beats and stabs Gorgon to death, while she taunts him by saying, \\"Guess you figured it out. Gotta wonder... you could be so easily fooled. Gotta wonder how much you even remember her now? All these years later...  Powers and abilities  Gorgon is a telepath capable of controlling minds, reading thoughts, and linking minds together, the latter being a skill she utilizes in combat by forcing opponents to experience the emotions, pain, and deaths of others. The character is also depicted as being proficient with blades and firearms, and is incapable of being observed through artificial means, such as satellite imaging.

The couple was blessed with three children (Marie born 10-7-1901, Katherine born 5-6-04, Herman Joseph born 9-4-1908). Middle child Katherine died from illness on December 28, 1911 at the age of seven on the large family farm in Monitor Springs, IN just east of Lafayette. The Kerkhoff family of four moved to southeast Missouri in 1911, and attempted to continue farming on a great parcel of land. The family fortune was lost, and the family returned to Lafayette, IN in late 1915. Herman was sworn in as a Lafayette policeman August 18, 1920. He passed at his home in Lafayette, IN on December 3, 1935. Early career Prior to his professional career, Herman played one documented season at Purdue University. He registered at Purdue as a “Special Student” in October 1895 before the Boilermakers played any games. He started all six games at left guard for the Boilermakers scoring a touchdown in an 18–4 win versus Minnesota. Purdue finished 4–3, one win was a forfeit victory Purdue claims versus Iowa State University. It is believed he also suited up for Purdue in 1892-1894 under an assumed name which was a common practice at the time for quality footballers and midwest collegiate football programs. No proof of participation has been documented. He also played football games for local Indiana teams including the Oakland Hill Bumpers (Lafayette, IN), Delphi, IN, Frankfort, IN, and Attica, IN. It is believed he also played for the orange and black clad Pine Village Villagers (Indiana) on occasion, but no proof of participation has been documented. Herman Kerkhoff was added to the Purdue University Football Media Guide as an 1895 football letter winner in 2019 after documentation was submitted on his behalf by his great-great- grandson William A. Fusiek and his triple great-granddaughter Claire Fusiek. Professional career Kerchoff began his professional career with the Indianapolis Artillery football team, which changed its name to the Indianapolis Athletic Association before the opening game in 1896. He was recruited to play for the Chicago Athletic Association by CAA football manager and former player Bill Thompson who would become future Chicago Mayor William “Big Bill” Thompson. The IAA “Gunners” “Athletics” “Cannoneers” played in Chicago several times in 1896, including twice versus the CAA. In 1896, the IAA unveiled its all yellow football uniforms in a football game versus the Chicago Cycling Club in Chicago. Kerkhoff and his “Cherry Circle” teammates claimed the mythical athletic association championship in 1897 after finishing the season 7–1. the CAA played two practice games versus Northwestern University that were somewhat controlled and scripted by the respective coaches; and thus, should not be counted as legitimate competitive games. The Athletics only loss was 16–6 at highly acclaimed Yale late in the season. Kerkhoff played one game for the IAA Athletics and the remainder of the 1897 season and the 1898 campaign for the CAA. From 1899-1901 Kerkhoff suited up for the “Cherry and Black” DAC Denver Athletic Club football team. His skills earned him mentions as “the most feared lineman in the west” at that time. The “guards back” play enabled the extremely fleet footed wonder boy milkman from Lafayette, IN to score touchdowns and become a Denver hero. The 1899 squad finished 7–0, claiming the athletic association champions of the west crown. The Athletics allowed only six points all season. Kerkhoff was named to the “All Colorado Team” by several sources in the 1899 “Silver and Gold” football season summary edition. In 1902, he helped the Pittsburgh Stars win the first and only “inaugural” NFL championship over the Philadelphia Athletics and the Philadelphia Phillies. That version of the National Football League lasted only one year and was not related to the modern NFL. He missed two games during the Stars season with a broken hand, vowing to play with a cage on it, if necessary. He played one game for Pittsburgh in coal miner boots because his huge cleats were on special order. The Pittsburgh team was managed by Dave Berry and played home games in Pittsburgh at The Colosseum. The Stars also practiced and played “home” games in Greensburg, PA. He was signed at the conclusion of the Pittsburgh season by Dave Printz and became a member of the Franklin Athletic Club, which won the 1903 \\"World Championship\\" or American Championship Tournament at Madison Square Garden in New York. Historians later renamed this event the 1903 World Series of Football. Herman scored both touchdowns in the 12-0 title clinching win versus Watertown Red and Black from New York. In a practice that was common at that time, Kerkhoff, his teammates, and residents of Franklin wagered large sums of money on the games, and returned to Franklin as wealthy heroes. In 1904, Kerkhoff joined the Massillon, OH team and in his first game for the squad, he helped Massillon record a key 44–0 win over the Pittsburgh Lyceum. He also contributed in a 28–0 victory over the Shelby Blues, and a 63–0 victory over the Sharon Buhl Club, the self-proclaimed champions of the western Pennsylvania football circuit. The 1904 and 1905 Tigers were unbeaten and claimed the Ohio League championships both years. In 1906, Herman semi-retired from football to pursue a life in politics. Kerkhoff ran for public office as Sheriff of Tippecanoe County Indiana in 1906 as a Democrat. After losing in the election, Canton's coach, Blondy Wallace, signed Kerkhoff and several other Massillon players to his Canton team. (To replace Kerkhoff, Massillon signed Tiny Maxwell.) Canton and Massillon matched money offers until Canton finally offered more, so Herman joined the Bulldogs before the scheduled two-game home and home series against Massillon, which would determine the 1906 \\"Ohio League\\" champions. Canton won the first game 10–5; but the second game and the championship was won by Massillon (13-6). It was alleged the players “fixed” the games to necessitate a third “big money” winner-take-all game to be held in Cleveland. The events surrounding the series resulted in accusations of a betting scandal.

The organization was founded by Abraham Israel in 1997. In April 2012, the Israel Police arrested 10 employees of Hazon, including the head, \\"on suspicion of pocketing millions of dollars from donors abroad for poor people, including Holocaust victims.\\" All information on this page regarding Hazon Yeshaya's charity work are claims made by the organization that were later proved to be untrue. Leadership In 1956, after the Suez War, Abraham Israel's family fled Egypt to escape growing anti- Semitism. They spent three years in Paris, France before immigrating to the United States of America. Abraham Israel received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Baruch College in New York City and worked as a shoe importer. In 1997, Abraham Israel moved to Israel with his family and founded Hazon Yeshaya. Soup kitchens Hazon Yeshaya soup kitchens serve more than 400,000 meals each month at more than 60 distribution points around Israel and is the only organization that provides soup kitchens facilities 365 days of the year in Israel. Beneficiaries included over 10,000 school children whose teachers have identified them to be in need of better nutrition. In 2008, expenditures on soup kitchens, including holiday packages, amounted to $9.9 million. Dental services Hazon Yeshaya Dental Clinics offer free services to an average of 2,000 patients each year. Services offered include implants, endodontics, crowns and bridges, periodontal therapy and surgery, dentures and orthodontic treatment. In 2008, expenditures on free dental clinics amounted to about $204,000. Vocational training Hazon Yeshaya offers a free vocational training for battered, divorced and single women, new immigrants, and discharged soldiers. Programs taught include hairdressing and barbering, cosmetics, computer skills, secretarial skills and office management. In 2008, more than 700 students participated and expenditures on vocational training amounted to about $591,000. Programs for children School Lunches More than 10,000 school children whose teachers have identified as in need of better nutrition receive free school lunches prepared in the Hazon Yeshaya Soup Kitchens. Bar and Bat Mitzvah Celebrations Hazon Yeshaya organizes bar and bat mitzvah services for orphans and children from abusive and broken homes. Approximately 600 children participated in 2008. After- School Programs Hazon Yeshaya provides structured after-school programs for children in math, reading, computer activities and sports. The program serves about 5,000 children per year. Day Care Hazon Yeshaya Day Care Centers provide day care for underprivileged preschooler students whose parents cannot afford tuition. In 2008, there were 250 children enrolled in the program and expenditures amounted to about $942,000. Holocaust registry As part of its activities, Hazon Yeshaya identifies and documents survivors of the Holocaust, many of them impoverished. The organization maintains a registry of some 15,000 names from more than a dozen countries. More than 5,000 individuals who are registered receive services from Hazon Yeshaya. Programs include meals-on- wheels and free dental work. Funding controversy In early 2012, the Israeli Registrar of Non-Profits began conducting an investigation of Hazon Yeshaya after it has received numerous complaints about its financial activities. Many of the international branches of Hazon Yeshaya have ceased channeling funds, including those in the UK, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, South Africa and France. On April 8, 2012, police arrested 10 employees, reportedly including the \\"head of\\" Hazon Yeshaya on suspicion of fraud and embezzlement. News reports suggest that the suspects cheated donors, and perhaps funds received from the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, by not using the funds for their direct intended purpose, to purchase food for the needy and Holocaust survivors. Instead the food was sold to ultra-Orthodox groups and the arrested are suspected of pocketing those funds. The fraud also included claims of fake food distribution centers. In addition to the theft, police suspect the charity of money laundering, aggravated fraudulent receipt of goods,and forging corporate documents. Police raided Hazon Yeshaya's offices in Jerusalem and seized records. The extent of the fraud and theft could be as high as \\"tens of millions of dollars.\\" On July 1, 2012, the Jerusalem District Court gave another Israeli charity organization, Carmei Ha'Ir, responsibility for providing food services formerly provided by Hazon Yehsaya.

In 1775, Vien left Paris as he became director of the French Academy in Rome, and took David with him. Giroust thus decided to move to study with Nicolas Bernard Lépicié. In 1778, after being awarded the Prix de Rome with the painting The Indignation of David, Giroust left for Rome where he once again joined Vien. Once back in France, Giroust was elected at the Academy, on 29 March 1788, with the painting Oedipus at Colonus, a work of pure Neoclassicism. The choice of a blind hero was surely informed by David's 1780 Blind Belisarius. Giroust's career was however brought to an end by the French Revolution. He didn't champion the new regime, and eventually retired to the countryside and hardly painted anymore. Giroust died in 1817.

It includes the modern administrative county and the 'principal areas' of Torfaen, Newport and Blaenau Gwent together with those parts of Cardiff and Caerphilly to the east of the Rhymney River. The geology of Monmouthshire in southeast Wales largely consists of a thick series of sedimentary rocks of different types originating in the Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Triassic and Jurassic periods. The oldest rocks, of Silurian age, occur as a broad, northeast to southwest aligned anticline in the heart of the county. The central portion of this zone, between Usk and Pontypool, comprises the outcrop of the older shales, limestones and sandstones and, surrounded as it is by outcrops of younger rocks, is traditionally referred to as the Usk Inlier. These younger rocks are a mix of sandstones and mudstones of Devonian age and commonly referred to as the Old Red Sandstone or, colloquially the 'ORS'. The oldest rocks of the ORS sequence (and hence lowest in the sequence), the mudstones of the Raglan Mudstone Formation, are also assigned to the Silurian period, though were once considered to be Devonian. Towards the eastern, southeastern and western margins of the county are successive layers of rocks of Carboniferous age. The oldest of these and hence the lowest, resting directly on the ORS are various formations of the Carboniferous Limestone. These in turn are overlain, in the west, by the sandstones and mudstones of the Marros Group (formerly referred to as the 'Millstone Grit series') and lastly by the sandstones, mudstones and coal seams of the South Wales Coal Measures. Along the southern coastal strip are rocks of Triassic age which unconformably overlie the Devonian and Carboniferous rocks. An area of countryside at Llanwern, east of Newport is characterised by rocks of Jurassic age, the youngest solid rocks which occur within the county. Similar though smaller outcrops of Jurassic rocks can be found at Goldcliff on the Severn Estuary and also, concealed beneath more recent sediments, near the mouth of the Ebbw River south of Newport. There are a range of different types of superficial deposits of Quaternary age overlying the solid rocks ranging from estuarine alluvium along the coastal strip, through riverine alluvium in the floors of the major river valleys to glacial till and glacial sands and gravels. These 'drift' deposits also include peat, head and landslipped masses of both bedrock and superficial material.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological maps 214, 215, 232, 233, 249, 250, 263British Geological Survey 1:250,000 scale geological map The Rocks of Wales/Creigiau Cymru, 1st edn, Solid. NERC 1994  Silurian  Geology of Monmouthshire; map There is an inlier of rocks of Silurian age in the heart of the county, west of Usk and straddling the River Usk and known accordingly as the Usk Inlier. These rocks consist of a thick sequence (over 600m / 2000 ft) assigned to the Přídolí, Ludlow and Wenlock series. The oldest parts of the succession, the Wenlock Shales and Wenlock Limestone of early authors are now referred to as the Glascoed Mudstone, Ton Siltstone and Usk Limestone. Together these comprise the local Wenlock succession. Above these are the former Lower Ludlow Shales, now the Lower and Upper Forest Beds, and the Aymestry Limestone, now the Lower Llanbadoc Beds. The Upper Llanbadoc Beds and Lower, Middle and Upper Llangibby Beds (collectively forming the larger part of the former Upper Ludlow Shales) complete the Ludlow series. All of these rocks are of marine origin, their lithologies suggestive of a variety of deep and shallow water environments during deposition. The uppermost Silurian rocks are the Downton Castle Sandstone and the overlying Raglan Mudstones, both of Přídolían age. The Přídolían rocks were deposited in various coastal and floodplain environments.Barclay, W.J. 1989 Geology of the South Wales Coalfield. Part II, the country around Abergavenny, 3rd edn. Mem Br Geol Survey Sheet 232 (England and Wales) (ch2)  Devonian  Within Monmouthshire, the Devonian consists entirely of the Old Red Sandstone. It is widespread in its occurrence from the Black Mountains in the north, wrapping around either side of the centrally located Usk Inlier and extending in a strip north of Newport towards Cardiff. Traditionally divided into three parts, the lowermost Red Marl Group, the middle Red Sandstone Group and uppermost Quartz Conglomerate Group, modern classification of the sequence recognises the St Maughans Formation (which directly overlies the Raglan Mudstone Formation), the Senni Formation and the Brownstones Formation (these three comprising the Lower Devonian) together with the Plateau Beds Formation and Quartz Conglomerate Group of the Upper Devonian. The relatively hard-wearing sandstones of the Brownstones Formation form the greater part of the Black Mountains ridges of Hatterrall Hill and Chwarel y Fan and the conspicuous hills of Sugar Loaf, Ysgyryd Fawr and Bryn Arw. The Brownstones also give rise to a major landscape feature in eastern Monmouthshire, a sinuous though largely unbroken west and northwest-facing escarpment which runs from the Wye Valley at Monmouth south and southwest to Newport and forming the hills at Trellech, Devauden and at Wentwood. Graig Syfyrddin forms a westerly outlier of this scarp.Barclay, W.J. 1989 Geology of the South Wales Coalfield. Part II, the country around Abergavenny, 3rd edn. Mem Br Geol Survey Sheet 232 (England and Wales) (ch3) South of Gaer Wood, west of Trellech, it forms a significant watershed with streams running west, draining into the Usk catchment. The uppermost Devonian age pebbly conglomerates of the Quartz Conglomerate Formation give rise in the east of the county to a secondary, though less pronounced scarp which provides this part of Monmouthshire with its highest elevation, the 306m / 1003 ft high flat-topped eminence of Beacon Hill.  Carboniferous  Carboniferous rocks occur most widely in the west of the county where the deeply dissected plateau of the South Wales Coalfield consists of the Coal Measures sandstones, mudstones and of course, coal seams - all of Westphalian age. The plateau is edged by the outcrop of the Namurian age Millstone Grit and the Dinantian age Carboniferous Limestone. The Carboniferous Limestone also occurs widely in the southeast of the county and along the sides of the Wye Valley. Carboniferous Limestone The limestone of South Wales is subdivided into a number of individual formations, not all of which are present in Monmouthshire and some that are, are notably thinner here than is the case further to the west. Those which outcrop on the north and east facing scarp which forms the edge of the coalfield dip into the coalfield at increasingly steep angles as the outcrop is traced south from Blorenge through Pontypool to the northeastern edge of Cardiff. The outcrop was extensively quarried in the past particularly around Gilwern Hill and Blorenge, in connection with the former ironworking industry. Marros Group Referred to traditionally as the Millstone Grit (Series), the group comprises a basal sandstone overlain by mudstones. The sandstone, formerly known as the Basal Grit but now known formally as the Twrch Sandstone outcrops around Blorenge but can be difficult to distinguish from the overlying sandstone. South Wales Coal Measures The Coal Measures occupy the majority of the western part of the historic county, today's Caerphilly and Blaenau Gwent unitary districts and half of Torfaen. Though now defunct, the legacy of the coal industry in this area is considerable. A sandstone extends widely across the area near the base of the Lower Coal Measures and is overlain by coal and ironstone-rich strata. The uppermost Coal Measures are again dominated by sandstone, the Pennant Sandstone forming the tops of the hills between the 'coalfield valleys'. Recent changes in stratigraphic nomenclature place these sandstones within the Warwickshire Group.  Triassic  The almost flat-lying sandstones of the Triassic unconformably overlie the older rocks which tend to dip to the south. The Triassic sandstones are often known as the New Red Sandstone thereby distinguishing them from the Devonian age Old Red Sandstone. The uppermost beds of the Triassic are the Rhaetian age 'Rhaetic' which occur in the Llanwern and Wilcrick areas and at Goldcliff.Welch, F.B.A. & Trotter, F.M. 1961 Geology of the Country around Monmouth and Chepstow, HMSO, London(Ch.11) At Black Rock near Portskewett are seaweed-covered outcrops of sandstone which form a part of the Mercia Mudstone Group. It was beneath these rocks and through the underlying Pennant Sandstone that the Severn Tunnel was driven between 1873 and 1886 from nearby Sudbrook.  Jurassic  A small outlier of Jurassic age strata occurs east of Newport as does a rather smaller one on the coast at Goldcliff. They comprise rocks assigned to the Lias. The cliff exposure here was commented upon by Gerald of Wales in 1188: Not far hence is a rocky eminence, impending over the Severn, call . . . Gouldcliffe or golden rock, because from the reflections of the sun's rays it assumes a bright golden colour.  Origins of the Wye gorge  The origins of the deeply incised gorge of the River Wye which forms Monmouthshire's eastern border continue to be discussed. One proposal, that of superimposed drainage is that during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, sedimentary rocks similar in part to those found in the Cotswolds, were laid down across the area, burying the older Carboniferous Limestone. During the succeeding Tertiary period, an early version of the Wye flowed across the area, which at that time formed a flat coastal plain, and developed large meanders as it did so. When the land in the area subsequently began to rise relative to sea level the river was able to maintain its course by cutting down into its bed, so incising its course. In time the younger rocks were eroded away entirely whilst the river began to cut down through the underlying Carboniferous rock succession, as revealed in the sometimes craggy sides of the gorge today. Another theory for its formation involves the erosive power of debris-laden glacial meltwater escaping from proglacial lakes.  Igneous rocks  Igneous rocks are limited to a couple of very minor intrusions of monchiquite in the Old Red Sandstone to the southeast of Usk. There appears however to be a common (and mistaken) belief amongst non-geologists that Sugar Loaf is an extinct volcano. Nevertheless, it is formed entirely of sedimentary rocks but has been eroded into a shape which, particularly when viewed from the east, is reminiscent of a stratovolcano.  Structure  There are numerous faults which affect the Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of the county. They are most numerous, or at least have been most intensively mapped, within the Coalfield area. The majority in this area are aligned northwest to southeast. In the north, the major fracture known as the Neath Disturbance cuts north-east trending through the Old Red Sandstone to the north of Sugar Loaf and thence along the Monnow valley to its east. It is the southernmost major tectonic feature of the British Caledonide belt,Barclay, W.J. & Wilby, P.R. 2003 Geology of the Talgarth District; a brief explanation of the geological map. Sheet explanation of the British Geological Survey. 1:50,000 sheet 214 Talgarth (England and Wales). though was active again in the later Variscan orogeny. Three roughly north-south aligned reverse faults are recognised in the Chepstow-Caldicot area.  Quaternary = Glacial legacy  There is clear evidence for glaciation of the uplands in the west of the county having taken place on one or more occasions. The Vale of Ewyas in the Black Mountains and the Sirhowy Valley, Rhymney Valley, Ebbw Vale and the valley of the Ebbw Fach in the Coalfield bear the hallmarks of glacial excavation - U-shaped profiles and over-steepened sides. There are moreover stretches of glacial till spread across their flanks. Substantial moraines are evident in the Usk valley including the Nevill Hall/Llanfoist moraine south of Abergavenny and the Usk Moraine which is believed to represent the furthest advance of an Usk valley glacier during the last Ice Age. The Punchbowl is a well-developed glacial cirque on the eastern side of Blorenge.Barclay, W.J. 1989 Geology of the South Wales Coalfield. Part II, the country around Abergavenny, 3rd edn. Mem Br Geol Survey Sheet 232 (England and Wales) (Ch.8,p114) There are no indications that Cwm Craf on its northern side held a glacier but it is perhaps periglacial in origin.  Landslips Coalfield and fringes= Landslips are common on the steep sides of the coalfield valleys where a combination of glacial over-deepening and the presence of the Pennant Sandstone overlying weaker mudstones has provided favourable conditions for ground movement. Mining activity has reactivated ancient landslips in certain cases. Slips are especially common around Coity Mountain and within the Sirhowy and the two Ebbw valleys. On the northeastern fringe of the coalfield, there are slips in the vicinity of Blorenge, the most well-known of which is the Tumble through which the B4246 road climbs towards Keeper's Pond. A notable example of mass movement is Mynydd Henllys, west of Cwmbran where a large section of the mountain has slipped northwestwards into the post-glacially deepened valley of the Nant Cam, leaving a 2km long degraded fissure feature high on the eastern slopes. It owes its origin to a mass of sandstone slipping in rotational fashion on a surface approximating to the Brithdir coal seam and associated mudstones and seatearths. =Black Mountains= The Black Mountains and nearby lesser hills formed from the Old Red Sandstone are formed from interlayered sandstones and less competent mudstones with the whole typically dipping southwards. The rocks are fractured in places and valley sides have been oversteepened by the passage of glacial ice. Various combinations of these circumstances has led to large numbers of landslips having taken place over millennia. Major slips are apparent on the western flanks of Ysgyryd Fawr and also affecting its southern ridge. Slips occur on either side of Cwm Coedycerrig with the largest affecting the southeastern slopes of Gaer on the north side. The landslipped material fills the valley floor. Smaller slips are evident on the northern slopes of the Sugar Loaf though the largest on that hill is at Graig where a spur extends towards the River Usk. Cwmyoy village famous for the crooked nature of St Martins Church sits on a landslip extending down from Hatterrall Hill which is still moving, albeit slowly. Nearby is the large sandstone cliff of the Darren, the back wall of another large slip. Further slips are evident within the Vale of Ewyas including the ground which rises to the east above Llanthony Priory. Further east in lowland Monmouthshire, though affecting the same rock strata, landslips are recorded around Graig Syfyrddin and towards the Monnow valley as at Coed y Pwll northwest of Skenfrith. =Wye valley= The deep incision of the Wye into the landscape on Monmouthshire’s eastern border has left slopes open to landslip. Two significant examples are seen between St Arvans and Tintern where Black Cliff and Wyndcliff represent the back walls of broad slips which extend down to the riverbank. Both crags are formed from strata of the Black Rock Limestone Subgroup (traditionally referred to as the 'Lower Dolomite'). It sits atop the less competent strata of the Avon Group (traditionally the 'Lower Limestone Shale') which has collapsed under the loading. The A466 road runs through the middle of both slips.  Alluvium  The floodplains of each of the major river valleys within the county are floored by fluviatile alluvium. The most extensive is that of the River Usk though this narrows for a couple of miles south of Llanfihangel nigh Usk. Those of the River Monnow and Afon Lwyd are up to 350m wide in places whilst that of the Trothy is rather narrower. In contrast there are wide spreads of these deposits around the smaller Olway Brook from Raglan southwards. Alluvial flats are restricted within the Wye valley as the river has cut itself a narrow gorge. The Coalfield rivers show similarly restricted floodplain development, occupying as they do, valleys which have been cut largely by glacial action.Barclay, W.J. 1989 Geology of the South Wales Coalfield. Part II, the country around Abergavenny, 3rd edn. Mem Br Geol Survey Sheet 232 (England and Wales) (Ch.8)1:50K and 1\\" geological map sheets There is evidence of river terrace development along the course of both the Usk and the Wye. There are extensive deposits of estuarine alluvium on the shores of the Severn. The bulk of this is in the form of silt of a blue/grey colour. The reclaimed estuarine flats behind the modern sea defences are as much as 5 km in width east of Newport. Tidal flats extend considerably into the Severn estuary.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 geological map sheet (England & Wales 250 Chepstow  Artificial ground  Within the coalfield, as a result of mining activities, there are a number of areas of artificially made ground, consisting for the most part of spoil from both opencasting for coal and deep mining. A high profile example is that of the Canada Tips, an area of excavation and deposition of Coal Measures rocks north of Blaenavon associated in particular with opencasting during the Second World War. It is now included within the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape World Heritage Site. Other areas are formed by material such as slag from former ironworks.  Geoconservation and geotourism  An early appreciation of a landscape shaped by its geology was afforded to those who undertook the Wye Tour in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a significant part of the Picturesque movement. The combination of towering limestone cliffs, wooded hillsides and cultural items such as Tintern Abbey contributed to the perceived sublime nature of the area. In more recent times (1971) it has been designated an area of outstanding natural beauty or AONB. Some sites of special scientific interest within the county (or in a number of cases, straddling its boundaries) have been designated wholly or largely on geological grounds, an example being the Upper Wye Gorge SSSI. Other sites have been recognised as regionally important geodiversity sites or RIGS. The World Heritage Site at Blaenavon (described above) is designated principally for its industrial heritage which is almost wholly based on the local extraction of coal, ironstone, limestone and silica rock for the production of iron. Accordingly it seeks to conserve and promote various of these sites. The hills and mountains of northwest Monmouthshire form a part of the Brecon Beacons National Park designated in 1957. Numerous publications list walks in the area visiting and interpreting the area's industrial archaeology centred on exploitation of its underlying geology.  Economic geology  Monmouthshire extends into the easternmost part of the South Wales Coalfield and accordingly there was historically considerable extractive industry in that area associated not just with coal mining but also workings for ironstone and indeed for limestone. The 'north crop' of the limestone was worked in a semi-continuous line of quarries eastwards from the border with the then county of Brecknock, now Powys. These quarries are found on the broadly north-facing scarps of Mynydd Llangatwg, Gilwern Hill and Blorenge. Substantial quarries also operated within the Clydach Gorge. Shallower workings followed the 'east crop' south from Blorenge along the eastern slopes of Mynydd y Garn-fawr and Mynydd Garnclochdy to Pontypool where the limestone strata is thinner than to the west. Most quarries were served either by tramroads connecting to the canal or else to ironworks such as those at Nantyglo. Limestone was also formerly worked in the Wye Valley on the county's eastern border. The Lower Dolomite was once quarried at Hadnock Quarry on the left (south) bank of the Wye, northeast of Monmouth as it was too at Livox Quarry north of Chepstow and at Beaufort Quarries south of Chepstow. All of these quarries are now abandoned.

What was a private residence was converted into a nursing home in 1955, and a senior apartment facility in 2016. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Henry Kahl Henry Kahl was born in a small cottage on the northwest side of Davenport. By the age of 12 or 13 he was driving a mule team between Davenport and nearby Coal Valley, Illinois. At 16 he started working for Davenport contractor P.T. Walsh and rose up through the ranks of the company that built railroads across the United States. Eventually he became vice president of the company and oversaw the work on the New York Central Railroad. The company was also known for the tunnel system it built for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which moved water from the Colorado River to Southern California. Other projects included train stations in Buffalo, New York, Erie, Pennsylvania, South Bend, Indiana, a sewage disposal plant in Dayton, Ohio, and the Memorial Bridge in Wilmington, Delaware. By the age of 45 he was a partner in the construction firm and a self-made millionaire, and with his money, he invested in various companies and real estate. He bought property along Third Street in downtown Davenport. On one of the parcels he built the Kahl Building. He died in 1931 at the age of 56. History North facade Henry Kahl had the house built for his family home in 1920. It was designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style by Davenport architect Arthur Ebeling. He also designed the Kahl Building downtown. Davenport banker V.O. Figge and his wife Elizabeth, who was Henry Kahl's daughter, donated the house and its property to the Catholic Diocese of Davenport to use for charitable purposes. In 1954 Bishop Ralph Hayes invited the Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm to the diocese and in 1955 they turned the house into a 25-bed, dormitory-style retirement home called the Kahl Home for the Aged and Infirm. Originally, the home housed only women. In 1963 they added a modern building and a chapel onto the main house. This made it possible to care for men as well. A 1987 addition brought the total number of beds to 135. The original house provided living space for the sisters, offices and guest rooms. In 2009 the Sisters announced that they intended to build a new facility on the north side of the city and vacate the central Davenport location. A new $40 million nursing home opened in August 2012 and the old home was vacated. In October 2013 plans were announced to turn the facility into a 68 unit senior apartment building. The facility was bought by Gold Coast Housing LLC from the Carmelite System Inc. in February 2015. The renovation project began in March of the same year. The rooms on the main floor of the mansion will be renovated and used as public space. The study was converted into the manager's office. The lower level houses one large apartment, while the second and third floors were converted into two apartments each. The third floor was originally a ballroom that had been converted into 20 bedrooms. The main staircase has also been restored. The 1963 addition has been renovated into 36 apartments, and the 1987 addition into five apartments. The renovation was completed in late 2016. Architecture The 3½-story house is composed of cream-colored brick in a combination of the Spanish revival and Mission revival styles. It sits high on the bluff on spacious, terraced grounds. The house remains largely intact even though the east side has been modified somewhat to connect to the main nursing home building. with There is a Porte-cochère on the north side of the house, and tall end chimneys with decorative concrete caps at several different locations. Other decorative elements on the houses exterior include Baroque ornamentation surrounding oval windows; a balustraded piazza; and superimposed loggia with columns distyle-in-antis. The entire structure is capped with multiple hipped roofs covered in red ceramic tiles. See also *Donahue Building, headquarters building for the Walsh-Kahl Construction Company.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 1 April 1971, and was vested in the Trust on 23 October 1972. History The church was built in the 13thor 14th century. The chancel and the 15th century tower are the only parts of this mediaeval parish church to survive. In the 1880s the nave was demolished and the new Holy Trinity Church was built in the village by Edward Schroeder Prior. The old church continued to be used as a mortuary chapel until 1971. Subsequently, the chancel was used as a mortuary chapel. In 1971, the dilapidated state of the church lead to it being formally declared redundant and in 1972 it became the responsibility of the Redundant Churches Fund, which became the Churches Conservation Trust. Architecture The stone building now consists of the three-bay chancel with a stone slab roof of arch-braced collar construction. The chancel is approximately long and wide. The two or three-stage tower to the south of the chancel has gargoyles and a parapet. It is supported by short buttresses. The doorway on the west side has a plank door. The interior of the church includes an early Georgian reredos, and a 13th century font although the base and stem are from the 20th century.

G. Springsteen and starring Kent Taylor, Jane Hylton and Kathleen Byron. Plot Renowned scientist Professor Henrik (Hugo Schuster) returns to England from a working trip overseas and is met by his glamorous secretary Joan (Hylton). American Ted O'Hara (Taylor) has come in on the same flight and in the bustle of the airport he and Henrik mistakenly pick up each other's identical briefcases, and O'Hara innocently departs with a briefcase containing a top- secret formula for a revolutionary new type of jet fuel. Later, Henrik is abducted by a group headed by a sinister man named Zelinsky (Karel Štěpánek), who are eager to lay their hands on the formula. They are furious to find that Henrik's briefcase contains nothing more than the everyday bits and pieces of a man called O'Hara. They detail one of their number, the sultry Renée (Byron), to track down O'Hara and gain his confidence. This she does, then a henchman appears and forcibly takes the puzzled O'Hara to the headquarters of the Zelinsky operation. They tell him that he has Henrik's briefcase, which he had not previously known, and that they are prepared to pay handsomely if he passes it over. Rather than cash in on this unexpected turn of events, O'Hara goes to Scotland Yard. He says that he heard Zelinsky mention the name Weber, apparently an espionage agent in Paris. The inspector briefs O'Hara to go to Paris and make contact with Weber. O'Hara is followed by Renée and a cohort, who manage to steal the briefcase during the journey. O'Hara finds Weber (Frederick Valk) in Paris, and learns that he now has the briefcase in his possession but is unable to decipher the contents which appear to be written in a complex code. O'Hara returns to London and explains the situation to Scotland Yard. Not wanting to jeopardise Henrik's safety, the police suggest he should make contact with Joan, who seems the most likely to have the necessary information. O'Hara shadows her waiting for a moment to make unobtrusive contact, but before he can do so he is shocked to see her rendezvous with a member of the Zelinsky gang and hand over some documents to him. The scene is set, as O'Hara and the police try to establish whether the apparently innocent Joan has in fact betrayed Henrik and been a prime mover in the plot all along.

He had a particularly lengthy association with the National Theatre Prague where he was heard annually from 1924-1945. Professional career Born in Ostrava, Kubla studied the violin as a child and already performed as a soloist at the age of seven. His uncle, conductor of a children's choir, advised him to take singing lessons, which he did in Prague with Bohumil Ptak, later with Vaclav Svtech. Before pursuing a music conservatory education, he studied law in his native country. He then entered the Vienna Academy of Music and the Performing Arts in 1911 where he was a pupil through 1914.Pelikánová, Gabriela; Kahánková, Taťána. Rodáci a významné osobnosti Moravskoslezského kraje. Ostrava : Moravskoslezský kraj, 2006. pg. 26 Kubla made has debut as a professional singer in 1910 as a concert soloist. He first appeared on the opera stage in the role of Rodolfo in Puccini's La bohème at the Vienna Volksoper in 1914. He was a member of that opera house until 1920. His next engagement was at the Deutsches Theater Prague (1920–1924), where he sang the principal role in the premiere of the revised version of Alexander von Zemlinsky's opera Kleider machen Leute (20 April 1922). Subsequently, he worked as a permanent guest-artist at the National Theatre Prague, where he had made guest appearances before. He rejoined the Vienna Volksoper as a member during the 1932-1933 season, and again from 1936 until 1938. He made numerous guest-appearances, a.o. at the Vienna State Opera (1919, 1935, 1937) and in opera houses in Munich, Hamburg and Budapest. He also performed in Cairo, Chicago and New York City. His repertoire included one hundred and thirty roles (a.o. many Wagner roles, but also some operetta roles). He retired from the stage in 1945. He died in 1964 at the age of 74.

SpeA and speC are superantigens, which induce inflammation by nonspecifically activating T cells and stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines. SpeB, the most abundant streptococcal extracellular protein, is a cysteine protease. Pyrogenic exotoxins are implicated as the causative agent of scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. There is no consensus on the exact number of pyrogenic exotoxins. Serotypes A-C are the most extensively studied and recognized by all sources, but others note up to thirteen distinct types, categorizing speF through speM as additional superantigens. Erythrogenic toxins are known to damage the plasma membranes of blood capillaries under the skin and produce a red skin rash (characteristic of scarlet fever). Past studies have shown that multiple variants of erythrogenic toxins may be produced, depending on the strain of S. pyogenes in question. Some strains may not produce a detectable toxin at all. Bacteriophage T12 infection of S. pyogenes enables the production of speA, and increases virulence. History=Discovery and nomenclature SpeB was identified in 1919 as an ectoenzyme secreted by certain strains of streptococci. It was originally studied as two separate toxins, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B and streptococcal cysteine proteinase, until it was shown that both proteins were encoded by the speB gene and that the attributed pyrogenic activities were due to contamination by SpeA and SpeC. Pyrogenic, in streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, means \\"causes fever.\\" Erythrogenic refers to the typical red rash of scarlet fever. In older literature, these toxins are also referred to as scarlatina toxins or scarlet fever toxins due to their role as the causative agents of the disease. SpeB is known as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, streptopain and streptococcal cysteine proteinase as a result of its original misidentification as two separate toxins, and is neither an exotoxin nor pyrogenic. Structure=Location of genes The speB and speJ genes are located in the core bacterial chromosome of all strains of S. pyogenes. However, despite its presence and high levels of conservation in the nucleotide sequence, 25-40% of these strains do not express the SpeB toxin in significant amounts. In contrast, speA, speC and speH-M are encoded by bacteriophages. There is a lack of consensus over the location of the speG gene, which has been attributed to both the core chromosome and lysogenic phages. Protein structure Structure of SpeB. SpeB is a 28 kDa protein with three major forms, mSpeB1, mSpeB2 and mSpeB3, which are categorized by variations the primary amino acid sequence. Three amino acids, C192, H340, and W357, are vital for enzymatic activity in all variants. The toxin contains a canonical papain-like domain, and mSpeB2 has an additional human integrin binding domain. Structure of SpeA1. All superantigenic streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins contain two major conserved protein domains that are linked by an α-helix, which consist of an amino-terminal oligosoccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold and a carboxy-terminal β-grasp domain, as well as dodecapeptide binding region. SpeA also has a cystine loop, a low-affinity α-chain MHC II binding site, and the Vβ-TCR binding site. SpeC, SpeG, SpeH and SpeJ contains a Zn2+-dependent high β-chain MHC II binding site in addition to the low affinity site present in SpeA, and lacks the cystine loop. SpeH also has an additional α3-β8 loop that mediates the specificity of the toxin's Vβ-TCR binding site. Processing and regulation The speB gene encodes for an amino acid sequence that becomes the 40 kDa zymogen, known as SpeBz, after cleavage of the signal sequence. SpeBz undergoes autocatalysis through at least eight intermediates to create the 28 kDa SpeBm. Finally cystine-192 and histidine-340 form a catalytic dyad. Each step is tightly regulated by multiple factors, allowing sophisticated temporal expression of the mature proteinase. Mechanisms of action T-cell dependent b-cell activation, showing TH2-cell (left) B-cell (right) and several interaction molecules.T cell receptor. SpeA and speC SpeA and SpeC bind to MHC Class II molecules, are presented to T cells, and bind to the variable region of the beta chain of T cell receptors. Once activated, the T cells release pro- inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The interactions with TCRs are characterized by low affinities and fast dissociation, allowing the toxin to activate multiple T cells in succession. The lack of specificity allow the activation of up to 50% of the T cells in the body. SpeB SpeB cleaves degrades multiple proteins through hydrolysis, including cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins and immunoglobulin. It requires three amino acids before the cleavage site, known as P1, P2 and P3. Of these, SpeB has a preference for hydrophobic P2 and positively charged P1 residues, with greater importance of the P2 amino acid. Roles in Virulence, Pathogenesis and Infection=SpeB Streptococcal cysteine proteinase has roles in immune evasion and apoptosis, as well as potential influence on bacterial internalization. There is contradictory evidence regarding the effect of SpeB on virulence. Some studies have reported increased protease levels in strains that cause scarlet fever in comparison to those associated with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, while others show decreased expression in more virulent strains. SpeB degrades immunoglobulins and cytokines, as well as through cleavage of C3b, inhibiting recruitment of phagocytic cells and the complement activation pathway. This results in decreased inflammation and neutrophil levels around the site of infection, preventing clearance and through phagocytosis and promoting the survival of S. pyogenes. The toxin also induces apoptosis in host cells after GAS internalization. Evidence suggests that this may take place through extrinsic and intrinsic caspase pathways. The receptor- binding pathway and Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway have been implicated in this process. The induction of apoptosis results in necrotizing fasciitis.

Biography He was the third son of Caleb Beck and Catharine Theresa Romeyn, only daughter of Rev. Theodorick Romeyn, D.D., long principal of the Academy of Schenectady, and one of the founders of Union College. While yet a child, in 1798, John Beck lost his father. After that, the care of his education and that of his four brothers, Theodorick Romeyn, Nicholas, Lewis Caleb, and Abraham, rested chiefly with his mother. At the age of 7, John left his home to reside with his uncle, John B. Romeyn, then pastor of the Reformed Dutch Church in Rhinebeck, New York. Here he began his classical studies. In 1804, Romeyn moved to New York City, his nephew accompanying him, and the young man's education continued. In 1809, Beck entered Columbia College, of which his uncle was a trustee, and where John M. Mason was provost. At Columbia, Mason was Beck's mentor throughout his college career. In 1813, Beck graduated with the highest honors of his class, and he was later appointed a trustee of the College. Immediately after his graduation, Beck accompanied his uncle in a voyage to Europe, and spending some time in London, he there applied himself to the study of Hebrew, under the instruction of a Rev. Mr. Humphries, a grandson of Doddridge. Beck learned enough to later take an intelligent interest in Biblical criticism. On his return from England, having determined to study medicine, Beck joined the office of David Hosack. Later medical politics would estrange them, though each always retained a high estimate of the learning and ability of the other. In 1817, Beck graduated from the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons. His thesis was a treatise entitled \\"On Infanticide.\\" The treatise was subsequently incorporated into his brother T. Romeyn Beck's noted work on medical jurisprudence, and became the standard work on infanticide in the English language. In 1822, Beck, in company with Drs. Dyckman and Francis, established the New York Medical and Physical Journal. Beck devoted a large portion of his time to this journal, and published many of his own articles in it. Among Beck's papers may be specially mentioned his paper on laryngitis and several reviews on the contagiousness of yellow fever. Beck continued as the chief editor of the Medical and Physical Journal for seven years, in later years associated with Dr. Peixotto. In 1826, he was elected professor of materia medica and botany in the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons. His appointment stemmed from the simultaneous resignation of all the previous faculty. This mass resignation, the crowning act of a long series of dissensions, threw upon the successors a weight of responsibility difficult to bear. Beck was prompt to take on his share of this weight, and his ability as a controversialist was too well known, and had been too sorely felt, not to insure to him a full share in any odium which the friends of the old could throw on the leaders of the new organization. Beck did well as a teacher, and also served the College as a zealous promoter of its interests, and a ready defender of its policy. In 1835, Beck was appointed as a physician of the New York Hospital, a situation which he filled for ten years. His services at the Hospital had a very favorable effect on Beck's reputation as a practitioner. Hitherto, his brethren had known him only as, for his age, a learned physician, a practised and able writer, and a judicious and attractive lecturer. At the Hospital, he proved himself sagacious in investigating disease at the bedside, and skillful in the application of remedies. Beck aimed to be judicious in the use of a few remedies, rather than to overwhelm disease by a multitude of cures. As a practitioner, he did not lose the opportunity of giving to the students and young physicians connected with the establishment clinical lessons. His was distinguished by great simplicity of language, clearness, and a devotion to utility rather than show. In 1843, he collected together, and published in a volume, a few of the most important of his contributions to periodical medical literature. In 1849, his work on infantile therapeutics appeared, and was received well both at home and abroad. When a very young man, Beck was elected trustee of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and censor of the County Medical Society. He later held the offices of vice president and president of the County Medical Society, vice president and then president of the State Medical Society, before which he delivered an inaugural address on the history of American medicine before the Revolution, which was afterwards published. He took an earnest interest in the organization of the New York Academy of Medicine, and was early elected one of its vice presidents, and, subsequently, orator. Failing health compelled him to decline the latter duty. For the last few years of his life he was a martyr to neuralgia and spasmodic disease from which his sufferings were most intense. He continued to visit patients and to lecture in the College till the beginning of the session of 1850–51. His funeral, two days after his death, was attended by almost all the more eminent members of the profession in the city. An address was delivered by the Rev. Dr. Knox, an old friend. Beck's intellect was characterized by energy: an end being set before him, he pursued it with a vigor, a steadiness of purpose, and a force of will which rarely failed to command success. He also had a clarity of perception: he saw the object presented to his \\"mind's eye\\" with all the distinctness of the most perfect physical vision. This quality was undoubtedly the secret of much of his success as a practitioner of medicine, and a medical writer and teacher. He saw disease just as it was; theories never distorted, nor did prejudice obscure it: all was clear and perfectly distinct from every other object. Having this quality in so eminent a degree, and being both in English and the classics a thorough scholar, he could not fail, as a teacher, to communicate in words a just and accurate idea of the object before him. So in argument and controversy, he saw the question to be discussed, or the point in dispute clearly; it was perfectly definite to his apprehension, and consequently his arguments neither fell short of, nor flew beyond the point. Beck's success as a teacher has already been noticed. He united qualities often seen apart, that made him both useful and popular. His lectures were clear, precise, and singularly practical: no merely specious theories, no rash generalizations, no loose assertions, found place there; all was logical, accurate, true. When the lecture was over, with a ready courtesy he answered the questions and solved the doubts of his pupils, and removed, by repeated and varied illustration, the difficulties in the way of their perfect comprehension of a subject. In regard to personal character, Beck exhibited a steady adherence to principle, an ardent love of truth, an unhesitating, unwavering, almost instinctive preference of the right over the expedient. He was a member of the Reformed Dutch Church, the church of his forefathers. Writings In addition to his thesis treatise, his major publications include: *Medical Essays (1843) *Infant Therapeutics (1849) *Historical Sketch of the State of Medicine in the Colonies (1850) Family Beck's mother lived to be 85 and survive four of her sons. In 1831, John Beck married Anne Tucker, eldest daughter of Fanning C. Tucker, who, with five children, survived him. Two of Beck's brothers, Theodoric Romeyn Beck and Lewis Caleb Beck, were distinguished physicians.

He wrote a chronicle in the 1530s that gives an insight into contemporary thought and contains anecdotes that appear in later writings. The manuscript of the Roit or Quheil of Tyme is kept at the National Library of Scotland, Ms. 1746. It was donated by Lt.-Colonel W. W. Cunninghame of Caprington.Asdair M. Stewart, Alasdair, (1996), 230 note 12. Life Abell was born at Prestonpans around 1480. He was related to the Bellenden family; Robert Bellenden, Abbot of Holyrood was his great-uncle. Abell became a monk at Inchaffray Abbey in 1495, then moved to be an Observantine Franciscan Friar at Jedburgh. His chronicle, the Roit or Quheil of Tyme ends in 1537. Possibly Abell died soon after.Stewart, Alasdair M., (1996), 227-229. The manuscript survived in the family of Sinclair of Roslin Castle.Alasdair M. Stewart, (1996), 229-230 note 12. The Roit or Quheil of Tyme Adam Abell composed the Wheel of Time at Jedburgh Abbey Abell recounts much legendary history including the story of King Lear and his daughters, and Macbeth and the witches.Stewart, Alasdair M., (1996), 232. The chronicle ends in 1537 mentioning a process of divorce between Margaret Tudor, and Harry Stewart, Lord Methven. Norman Macdougall thought the three pages of the Quheil of Tyme that refer to James III of Scotland significant enough to print in his study of the king.Macdougall, Norman, James III, (1982), 314-315. Abell said of the death of James III in 1488: > \\"thai conspirit againis the king and gaif him batell beside striwiling and > thare he wes slane. He wes confessit before with maistir Johne Yrland > proffessor of theologie., ... thai slew him in the mill of > bannoburne..Norman Macdougal, James III (1982), 315. Macdougall found nothing strikingly original in Abell's account of James III, which depends in part on Hector Boece, but was able to infer that his other sources for the reign were sympathetic to James III and Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, and to Abell's contemporary, John Stewart, Duke of Albany.Macdougall, Norman, James III, (1982), 280-282. Writing in 1537 of events in the previous year, Abell tells the story of the visit of James V of Scotland to Mary of Bourbon, with the interesting suggestion that there had been an exchange of portraits; > \\"In ane dissimilit vestement he com to the duik of Vendôme fathir of the > lady that he suld haif marreit.

Alasdair Stewart contends that Abell's moralising handling of his subject matter and the examples he offers show his own strong character, contemporary attitudes and a unique view of international events from the cloister at Jedburgh.Alasdair M.

The station was opened as part of a new motor train service between and . It was the site of major works in 1933 when a plate girder bridge was constructed to replace a level crossing, enabling road traffic to pass underneath through a subway. The station closed in 1952 following a period of temporary closure during the Second World War. The line through Weelsby remained open for freight until December 1980. The trackbed was later reused by Humberside County Council to construct the A16 Peaks Parkway which now runs through the site. Building of the road put an end to the aspirations of the Great Northern and East Lincolnshire Railway plc (now the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway) to reopen the line as a heritage railway. History The station was opened on 11 December 1905 to coincide with the introduction of a motor train service on the East Lincolnshire Railway by the Great Northern Railway. It consisted of two low facing halt platforms to the south of a level crossing over Weelsby Road within the Grimsby town boundary. A small single-storey timber waiting shelter was provided on the up platform, opposite which was a signal box to control the crossing. A crossing keeper's cottage, similar in style to others on the line, lay to the north of the crossing. By 1914, the crossing was causing problems for traffic on Weelsby Road and a proposal was made to replace it with a subway. The First World War put an end to these plans and although the matter was raised again in 1919, it was not until May 1933 that works to construct the subway began under the oversight of the London and North Eastern Railway. The improvement scheme was completed at a cost of £20,000 (£ in ), with the works being carried out by Fletcher & Co. of Mansfield. A plate girder bridge replaced the level crossing, allowing the traffic to pass under via a subway. The works, which were completed a month ahead of schedule in December 1933, required the demolition of the crossing keeper's cottage. The upgraded crossing was opened by the Mayor of Grimsby in early December 1933, who was driven under the bridge in a double-decker bus. The station, at which trains only called upon request, closed as a temporary wartime measure in 1940, with the last train calling on 1 January. Official closure came on 10 March 1952. Present day Tracklifting commenced in early 1981, with the section between Grimsby and - constructed of bullhead rail - being the last to be removed. This section was designated by Humberside County Council for the building of the A16 Peaks Parkway. The roadworks, which run directly through the site of Weelsby Road Halt, put an end to hopes by the Great Northern and East Lincolnshire Railway plc, a preservation society now known as the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway, to reopen the line to Grimsby.

The resolution was drafted by France. Resolution=Observations The Security Council stressed that measures imposed in resolutions 1572 (2004) and 1643 (2005) were aimed at supporting the peace process in Côte d'Ivoire, particularly in light of planned presidential elections on October 31, 2010. It urged the Ivorian stakeholders to ensure that the elections went ahead as scheduled, and were free and fair. The Council noted that while the overall human rights situation had improved in the country, there were still various abuses reported against civilians, including acts of sexual violence. It determined that the situation in Côte d'Ivoire continued to pose a threat to international peace and security. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council renewed sanctions against the country relating to arms, diamonds, financial and travel until April 30, 2011, along with the mandate of the expert panel monitoring their implementation. The measures would be reviewed in light of progress achieved in the electoral and peace process. All Ivorian parties to the Ouagadougou Political Agreement were urged to fully implement the aforementioned measures and provide unhindered access to the expert panel monitoring the sanctions, with the assistance of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI). Furthermore, the Council decided that the arms embargo would not apply to non-lethal equipment for use by the Ivorian security forces for proportionate and appropriate purposes. It reaffirmed that measures would be imposed against persons who threatened the peace process, attacked or obstructed UNOCI or supporting French personnel, violate human rights or international humanitarian law or incited hatred and violence; there was also concern that some media outlets were inciting violence. The resolution asked the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and French forces to inform the Council of weapons supplies to Côte d'Ivoire. Meanwhile, the Kimberley Process was instructed to report on production and illicit export of diamonds from Côte d'Ivoire. All Ivorian parties and others were asked to co-operate and to ensure the safety and freedom of movement of the expert group.

It is known as waxyleaf nightshade. It is native to Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. It is usually classified under the section Cyphomandropsis, within the subgenus Bassovia. It is a rhizomatous plant with a simple stem and shortly branched, growing to 1–2 m tall or more. The leaves are simple, ovate, lanceolate, greenish-gray, and the plant produces 1–2 cm long, bluish purple flowers. The fruit is a globose berry 1–2 cm in diameter, blue-black, and features several seeds inside. It propagates vegetatively by gemmiferous roots of high regeneration capacity in water-saturated soils like edges of lakes. Its consumption by ruminants produces an illness on them.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History Buffalo was the first settlement in Scott County to incorporate (1836). with The first school building in the town was constructed three years later. The first school located at Fourth and Washington Streets was built in 1850. Ten years later Buffalo voted to become an independent school district. Buffalo Township was divided into seven independent school districts. The district that served the town of Buffalo was Independent School District #1. In 1865 they built a two-story frame school building on Fourth Street. By 1894 the town had grown to 500 people and the school building had become overcrowded. The school district hired Davenport architect Gustav Hanssen to design a new building. Plumbeck and Frandzen received the brick contract and likely used brick from the Davenport Paving Brick and Tile Company in Buffalo. Frank and Wrage did the carpentry work. The Knights of Pythias bought the old building and moved it to Third and Jefferson Streets. It remained standing into the 21st century. Opened in 1900 the new school building was a single-story, three-section, structure. It was capped with a hipped roof and had dormers for ventilation. The T-shaped building had a prominent gable-front entry vestibule and a belfry at the center. The building featured three classrooms, which was an increase from two in the previous building, and housed grades 1-8. Restrooms flanked the main entrance and a small office for the superintendent was located where the staircase is now situated. The school building was built for $5,000. The school educated students in eight grades until 1927 when ninth grade was added in preparation for the addition of high school classes. That same year Davenport architect Arthur Ebeling presented plans for the addition of a second story to the school building. A bond issue of $20,000 was passed in January of the following year, and J.H. Hunzinger was hired as the general contractor. The rooms on the new second floor aligned with those on the first floor. An office was located over the main entrance. The lower grades were housed on the first floor. Grades 1 and 2 were located in the west classroom, grades 3 and 4 in the north classroom, and grades 5 and 6 in the east classroom. The second floor housed the upper grades. Grades 7 and 8 were located in the west classroom and grades 9 to 12 were all taught in the east classroom. A science lab and other specialized classes were housed in the north classroom. The basement was also used for classroom space. Home economics was taught in the east room, and mechanical training in the west room. The boiler room was under the north classrooms as it was previously. The first class to graduate from Buffalo High School was in 1931 with 12 students. The smallest graduating classes were in 1932 and 1935 with five students and the largest class was 15 in 1943. There was no graduating class in 1948 as the three students attended Davenport High School. The school colors were red and white until 1942 when they were changed to blue and gold. By 1952 overcrowding was an issue again and a new school building was built on Dodge Street. It was dedicated on February 15, 1953, and the upper grades were moved into the new building. A law was passed in Iowa in 1958 that required minimum high school standards. Buffalo decided to discontinue their high school program. Because the Davenport Community School District refused to take the Buffalo students, they were bused to Bettendorf High School. Another state law was passed in 1966 requiring contingent districts to accept students, so Buffalo became part of the Davenport school district and their students attended Central High School. The 1953 Buffalo school was used as an elementary and intermediate school. Some classes were still held in the old Buffalo High School building through the mid-1970s. In 1976 the city of Buffalo bought the old high school building from the Davenport school district. They used it as a community center to house various offices and organizations, including the town's library. Davenport schools built a new school on the north edge of town in 2002. Many of the community offices moved from the old high school building to the 1953 building, which left the old building vacant. In 2004 it was sold to Thomas and Maria Caudle for $49,500. They converted it into a home. Developers Jesse Hammes and Tom Swanwick bought the building in 2010 with plans to convert the structure into a four condo complex.

It opened in 1962 and remains in use today. It was known as Butlin's Minehead until 1987, and as Somerwest World from then until 1999, when it reopened as Butlins Minehead Resort. History 6229 Duchess of Hamilton steam locomotive Butlins Holiday Camp Minehead 14 August 1974 Butlins Minehead Resort October 2010 typical scene In the winter of 1961, Billy Butlin began work on creating his camp in Minehead. The site was selected because of its flatness, good rail links, and proximity to the town and sea. The site was not without its problems, however, including flooding. In order to solve this, a trench was excavated around the site and an earth wall constructed. The trench later became the site's boating pond. The site opened to the public on 26 May 1962, the construction having cost £2 million. Over the next decade several attractions were added: the miniature railway in 1964, the chairlifts in 1965, and the monorail in 1967. Full size locomotives, Duchess of Hamilton and Knowle, were added in 1964. The locomotives left the camp in 1974 and have since been restored and preserved. Butlins Minehead underwent major development during the 1980s, when problems with flooding were finally fixed, and both the indoor and outdoor swimming pools were converted into funpools with the addition of waterslides, water cannons, and various other novelty features. Additional accommodation was constructed, and caravan accommodation was introduced. Following the redevelopment work, the camp was renamed Somerwest World. As at Bognor and Skegness, Minehead resort underwent further changes in 1998 and 1999 with the demolition of the Windsor building, relocation of the outdoor funpool and construction of the Skyline Pavilion in its place. However the changes at Minehead were less extensive than at the other two remaining Butlins resorts, and most of the original structures and layout remained intact. In 2007, further work in the Minehead resort was undertaken with the creation of new luxury timeshare apartments known as BlueSkies but has now been rebranded to the BaySide Apartments. Entertainment Butlins Minehead has a lot to offer from Go-Karting, Little Stars Fairground inc. softplay, outdoor and indoor sports, Splash Waterworld, mini-golf, driving school, a Dotto Train and a reasonably sized outdoor fairground including a historic Carousel, Mobile Trampolines, swing boats called Little Gems, a historic Waltzer (originally a Knight Rider), classic Dodgems, Paratrooper, Zierer Wave Swinger, traditional Helter Skelter and a Zamperla Rockin\` Tug. Ex More Adventures Butlins Minehead developed the Ex More Adventures which include a climbing wall, diving courses, horse riding, Land Rover safari, fly fishing and sea fishing, sailing, canoeing and coasteering, some of which are held at Exmoor National Park.

Production The show featured child actors and elaborate puppets created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The show featured puppeteers Mike Quinn, Mak Wilson, and Karen Prell as various characters, along with Angie Passmore as the titular Mother Goose. Fourteen of the episodes were based on stories in L. Frank Baum's 1897 book Mother Goose in Prose, while the others were original tales written for the show. The general look of the characters was based on the work of Maxfield Parrish, the artist who illustrated Baum's book. The series was originally conceived as a co- production between the Jim Henson Company and Television South West for British television and was first broadcast on Children's ITV in the UK in 1988. A pilot episode, the story of \\"Humpty Dumpty\\", was produced in 1987 along with other episodes. The series was considered for a network slot in 1987, but was passed on. The first release of the series came in 1988 through a home video release as part of Jim Henson's Play-Along Video series. The video featured three episodes of the show, \\"Little Miss Muffet\\", \\"A Song of Sixpence\\" and \\"Boy Blue\\", plus original linking footage between each story. The series finally found a home as a broadcast series on The Disney Channel starting on August 25, 1990, and was the company's first new television series to debut after the death of Jim Henson. Mother Goose Stories had three production seasons, spawning thirty-nine eight-minute episodes. For airing on The Disney Channel, the 39 independently produced episodes were grouped into 13 broadcast episodes to fit the half-hour time slot. Each of these broadcast episodes was composed of three separate stories (with individual opening titles and closing credits attached to each one). The show continued to air on The Disney Channel until 1993.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 11, no. 1, December 1992/January 1993: pp. 30, 42.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 11, no. 2, February/March 1993: p. 26. The first and third seasons of Mother Goose Stories were directed by Brian Henson, in one of his earliest directorial efforts for The Jim Henson Company, while Michael Kerrigan directed the episodes in the second season. Henson and Kerrigan received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Children's Program for their work on the show.

Outside of the building, Hamza and Kerim find Adis, who has died. They take him to the cemetery to be buried. On the wooden headstone placed on the grave, Kerim writes 'Adis', and encircles the name. In many scenes Hamza is seen with the two kids speaking monologues, while observing photos of his wife and daughter. All the poetry cited in the film by Hamza are verses written by Abdulah Sidran, renowned Bosnian writer and poet.

The screenplay was retooled during the siege while the director and writers took refuge in a Holiday Inn that had originally been constructed for the 1984 Olympics. Filming began again in 1996 after the signing of the Dayton Peace Accord and after director Ademir Kenović had gotten permission from the United Nations, whose forces were still monitoring the area. The film would go on to become the first Bosnian feature released after the 1992 Bosnian independence referendum, making it in some sense the first Bosnian film.

Huff was born in Portland, Maine, on April 24, 1942. He was trained as a sociologist but has been increasingly drawn to questions in the history, philosophy and sociology of science. Those inquiries led him to undertake Max Weber-inspired studies of the Arab and Muslim world, as well as China, including field work in Malaysia.The Writer’s Directory, 2010; Who’s Who in American Education, 2007-2008 He is best known for his book The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West. Career and contributions Huff earned a B.A. from Northeastern University, a Master’s from Northwestern University, and his Ph.D. from The New School For Social Research in 1971. He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey (1978–79) and prior to that was a Post-doctoral Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley working with Robert Bellah. Huff has been a Visiting Scholar at the National University of Singapore, the University of Malaya, and the Max Weber College in Erfurt, Germany. He taught sociology for thirty-four years at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth before becoming Chancellor Professor Emeritus in 2005. Since then he has been a Research Associate in the Department of Astronomy at Harvard University. At the New School Huff’s mentor was Benjamin Nelson On the Roads to Modernity: Conscience, Science and Civilizations, Selected Writings by Benjamin Nelson, edited by Toby E. Huff, Totowa, New Jersey: Rowman and Littlefield, 1981. who was then taking up “ the Needham Question,” the question of why modern science arose only in the West and not in China. Influenced by Nelson but also Robert Merton, Huff continued that line of inquiry that resulted in The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West.Huff, The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993, 2nd ed. 2003. It has been translated into Arabic, Turkish, Korean and Chinese. It is still being used in classroom teaching seventeen years after its first publication. By exploring questions in the history of science in the Arab-Muslim world, Huff further extended questions initially raised by R. K. Merton about religious and institutional factors supporting 17th century science in England. By questioning the cultural embeddedness of science in Islamic culture and civilization, Huff also stimulated controversy. That discussion has been taken a step further by exploring evidence of scientific curiosity in China, Mughal India, and the Ottoman Empire in comparison to Europe in the seventeenth century. The results of that inquiry are in his Intellectual Curiosity and the Scientific Revolution. A Global Perspective.Huff, Intellectual Curiosity and the Scientific Revolution. A Global Perspective. New York: Cambridge University Press, October 2010. Additional influence of Max Weber on Huff can be seen in two books, his Max Weber and the Methodology of the Social Sciences;Huff, Max Weber and the Methodology of the Social Sciences, Transactions Books, 1984 and Max Weber and Islam,Huff, Max Weber and Islam, co-edited with Wolfgang Schluchter, Transaction Books, 1999. co-edited with Wolfgang Schluchter. Early in his career Huff was influenced by a number of philosophers of science, especially N.R. Hanson and Karl Popper.Huff, Max Weber and the Methodology of the Social Sciences, pp. 1-2. That intersection of questions in the philosophy and history of science is seen in his contribution to the Karl Popper Centenary volume: The Open Society, Metaphysical Beliefs , and Platonic Sources of Reason ad Rationality.Huff, “The Open Society, Metaphysical Beliefs and Platonic Sources of Reason and Rationality,” in Karl Popper.

Starting in the early 1990s, Cell 7 was initially influenced by IDM artists such as Autechre and Aphex Twin as well as the more mainstream sounds of Depeche Mode, the Cure and Nine Inch Nails. The band has been referred to as \\"endustrial\\"Sphere Magazine, [ cell 7 ] RE:COGNITION review, July 2010 http://www.soundspheremag.com/reviews/cd/cd-review- cell-7-recognition/ in sound, possibly to indicate the distinction between Cell 7 and the normal perception of the industrial genre. The band is a duo consisting of Nick Mueller and Paul Harrison, with occasional additional live performers. The name Cell 7 is a reference to biological cells rather than incarceration, and the square brackets are part of the official moniker.  History  Nick and Paul both grew up in the hills of Perth, attending the same primary school. Meeting up again at university, after Mueller had trained in classical music, they began experimenting with sounds and instrumentation, combining alt-metal, gothic and industrial noise elements with synthpop, techno and electronica. They built a strong local following which was recognized with Cell 7 winning 3 consecutive WAMI awards (1999, 2000, 2001) and performing live on RTRFM. A limited edition mini-album (300 signed and numbered EPs) Precognition was released, selling out in under 72 hours. In late 2001 both members relocated to Sydney for work reasons, and Cell 7 took a hiatus from live performance. As Nick explained in a 4ZZZ radio interview – \\"real life got in the way\\".'Dark Essence' interview, 4ZZZ radio, Brisbane, April 2010 In 2007, Nick moved to Amsterdam in the Netherlands and there completed the recording and production on a full-length album.

The game requires a minimum of two players, but ideally a minimum of three players, and involves each player passing round cards in an attempt to acquire a hand consisting of all the same value cards. Upon doing so, they silently place their hand of cards on the table. The last player to notice that this has happened is the loser of the round. Playing the game=Setting up In a typical game of Schlafmütze, players will begin each with a hand of four cards, and one player (usually the dealer) has five cards. Sometimes when the group is larger, more than one player may begin with more cards to make game progress more swiftly. Play The player with the five card hand will begin proceedings by passing on one card from their hand to the player to their left. The aim of the game is to end with a four card hand complete with four cards of equal value (for example, four Kings). Players continue to pass around cards, attempting to build a hand of equal cards. When a player receives a card from another player which they have already seen, the card has already been around the entire group, and it can be assumed that no player wants that card, and so it is placed in the center of the playing area (face up). Any player with a card of that value in their playing hand must then put those cards in the pile in the center also (as it is not possible to win on that card). The player who initially put the card down in the center of the table then picks up a card from the remaining pack, which they add to their hand (to replace the card lost), as do all players who placed a matching card down. Cards continue to be passed around the group, with this cycle of events repeating until one player collects four of a kind. If at any point a player picks up a card from the deck which is of a value which has been put down in the center already, that card can be added to the center pile and they can pick another card to replace it. During play, no player may at any point place their cards down on the table/floor. Each player must hold all of their cards throughout the game in their hand until they either win (by collecting four of a kind), or notice another player has done so (see Winning below). Winning The winner of the game Schlafmütze is the player who first collects four of a kind. However, unlike in many of its sister card games, the winner does not announce when they have collected said cards. Instead, they place their cards face down on the table, or playing area. This is usually done slyly so as not to notify other players immediately. It is for this reason that no player is permitted to place their cards down at any point during the game, apart from when they have won the game. Once the player has placed their cards faced down, other players should do the same upon realizing their co-player has won (i.e. when the winner puts their cards down, every other player who notices this also puts their cards down). If the original winner puts their cards down carefully, it is less obvious to other players which means some players may play on for a short while before noticing. Sometimes, players who have put their cards down will continue to pass cards around (not actually playing the game), so as to give the image of playing, until the point where other players eventually realize they are out. The loser of the game is the last player to put their hand face down on the playing table. As a forfeit they have to wear a nightcap (German: Schlafmütze, hence the name) for the duration of the next game. Tips *If you are dealt a pair or three of a kind, stick to that value card throughout the game. *Make sure to never place your cards down during the game, unless you have won. This will suggest to other players that you have collected four of a kind and you will be disqualified for cheating. *Be sure to watch other players around to see when they have put their playing hands down on the playing table. *If you do collect four of a kind, be sure to place your cards down fairly quickly, but also secretively so as not to immediately alert other players of the situation. *When you have declared yourself out by putting your cards down, continue to pass cards around (sometimes even without looking at them), so that at first glance opponents believe you are still in play. *Upon seeing another player put their cards down, act quickly and put your hand down. Variation Sometimes a variation of Schlafmütze is played which involves dealing out a series of 'punishments' to the losing player. Upon completing a round of the game, the deck is collected and re-shuffled, and then placed face down next to the dealer (or the person to the left of the dealer if the dealer lost). The loser then chooses any card of the pack, and the dealer deals out every card in order from the bottom of the deck until reaching the loser's chosen card (so any number of cards, representing the number of punishments gained, between one card and the full 52 card deck could be awarded here). For example, if the loser chose the Seven of Hearts, the deck is dealt from the bottom, one by one, until coming to that card. The number of cards dealt in this new pile denotes the number of 'punishments' that player, the loser, will receive. Each punishment is done one-by-one, in turn around the player order. Different suits represent different types of punishment, which are usually agreed upon by the players beforehand. The higher the number on the card face (usually playing Aces as the highest card), the more severe the punishment. This variation is more often played as a drinking game.

It is the first of his Typhonian Trilogy, which comprises this work and two others—Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God (1973) and Cults of the Shadow (1975). In this work, he first introduced his theory that American horror author H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos was psychic revelation presented as fiction, an idea which he would elaborate and extend further in his later works. This idea - that what is ostensibly presented as fiction is often a vehicle masking deeper realities - has precedence in the inclusion by Aleister Crowley of many works of fiction in the official reading syllabus of his mystical and magical order, the Argentum Astrum ; Grant's recognition of Lovecraft's value may be seen as simply a detailed continuation, an \\"updating\\" of this basic idea using material which Crowley simply hadn't had the opportunity to read. Grant also claimed in this work that there was an unconscious connection between Lovecraft and occultist Aleister Crowley, arguing that both of them channeled their work from the same occult forces, although Lovecraft was not consciously aware of the alleged otherworldly sources of his literary inspirations. According to Professor Joshua Gunn of the University of Texas, The Magical Revival has been criticised by many occultists and historians alike for its \\"creative history making\\". On the other hand, Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology gave a more favourable review, calling it \\"a very informative survey of occult theory and practice in modern times\\".

History In 1962 the Bundeswehr planned to replace its fleet of vehicles which at the time still stemmed from the time the Army had been founded. The Bundeswehr desired amphibious two-, three- and four-axle vehicles in the 4 to 10 ton payload range. Because a high degree of new development was necessary, the German Federal Agency for Defence Technology and Procurement (Bundesamt für Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung, BWB) found itself unable to accept the responsibility for a decision, so suggested the bidding companies form a common development bureau and agree on one unified project. Two years later in 1964, the \\"Common Bureau of the German Utility Vehicle Industry\\" (Gemeinschaftsbüro der deutschen Nutzfahrzeugindustrie) was formed under the leadership of MAN. The manufacturers Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD), Büssing, Krupp and Henschel were also on board. On 12 August 1964, BWB drafted its second generation requirements. Specification of the next generation called for mostly standard commercial vehicles with unlimited cross-country mobility, amphibious, with permanent all-wheel drive, low-pressure run flat tires, a steel cab, NBC protection, a multifuel engine, and a minimum service life of ten years. Because procurement costs would have run too high and NATO established a new standard, the amphibious, NBC and multifuel capabilities were subsequently cancelled and requirements were re-drafted again. Payload of the twin-axle version was increased to 5 t, fording depth specified to 1,200 mm, loadbed height raised to 1,650 mm, and air cooled Deutz V8 engines with and without turbocharger as well as 14.00 R 20 size tyres were specified. However, even this 'trimmed-down' version was too expensive for comprehensive procurement. After further deliberations it was decided to procure a smaller number of the specialised, newly developed high-mobility trucks and supplement them with a number of near-standard trucks. This meant the army procured six different new truck models, initially three of them in the high-mobility off- road category. On 4 December 1975, the Bundeswehr and MAN signed the procurement contract covering the delivery of the special military trucks, now split even further into two more categories. The first Kategorie I-MAN, the 10 t mil gl, was delivered on 29 November 1976. The original intention was to build a family of logistics vehicles which could carry full loads across severe terrain whilst keeping up with modern main battle tanks. The first model produced was 8x8; 6x6 and 4x4 variants followed. The original KAT 1 design evolved into the MAN SX. A few ex-military MAN KAT1 vehicles are released onto the second-hand market in Germany. US military The United States Army and the United States Air Force operated four variations of the KAT 1 8x8 under the designations M1001, M1002, M1013 and M1014. * Truck Tractor w/Crane, 10-ton, 8X8 M1001 (NSN 2320-12-191-5422) * Truck Tractor w/Crane, 10-ton, 8X8, M1002 (NSN 2320-12-191-5423) * Truck Tractor w/Crane, 10-ton, 8X8, M1013 (NSN 2320-12-191-5424) * Truck Tractor w/o Crane, 10-ton, 8X8, M1014 (NSN 2320-12-191-5425) The M1001 was used by the US Army as the prime mover for the Pershing II nuclear missile. The tractor was configured with a fifth wheel to tow the erector launcher, an Atlas Maschinen GmbH 8-ton crane for handling missile components and a 30 kW generator to power the erector launcher. The M1002 was configured as a recovery vehicle with a Rotzler recovery unit, earth spades, Atlas Maschinen GmbH AK4300 M5 crane, and carriers for two erector launcher spare tires. The M1013 was used by the US Air Force as the prime mover for the Gryphon Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM). The tractor was configured with a fifth wheel to tow the launcher, a 2-ton material handling crane and a self-recovery winch. The M1014 was also configured as a prime mover and had a tire carrier for a launcher spare tire. General characteristics Cockpit of a MAN 10 t mil gl Identical to 5 t and 7 t Trailer hitch of MAN mil gl Introduced as the mil gl (for \\"militarisiert geländegängig\\" - military, cross country mobile), the MAN KAT 1 series is used by all branches of the Bundeswehr. Militarization includes a full blackout lights circuit completely separated from the standard lights, a military instrument layout with blackout option, an emergency stop switch to cut electrical power, a roof hatch with machine gun mount, and rifle brackets. The vehicles are Category I (KAT I) special military developments, and as such fully cross-country mobile. The KAT I vehicles of the 5 t, 7 t, 10 t payload classes belong to the second generation of Bundeswehr vehicles (Folgegeneration), and the KAT I A1 designated vehicles belong to the \\"expanded second generation\\" which also includes a 15-ton version. KAT I vehicles underwent a complete overhaul in the mid-1990s to extend their service life by another ten years, and replacemnet has only recently begun in earnest. Category I A1.1 vehicles (KAT I A1.1) like the 15 t mil gl \\"Multi\\", supporting the \\"Wechselladersystem Multi\\" multi mission container system, belong to the third generation and have been developed further but are still military special developments. The vehicles are widely known as the \\"5-, 7-, 10-, 15-Tonner\\", which denotes their military payload class (maximum load in metric tons). \\"Tonner\\" has developed into Bundeswehr jargon for \\"truck\\".  Design  All trucks of the KAT 1 and follow-on series share a modular design. They have a torsionally rigid box-section frame with rigid hub- reduction axles linked to the frame via coil springs. The engine is mounted inside the forward-control cab, which is separated into a driver and engine compartment by a firewall. As a distinctive feature, the engine is located to the rear of the driver compartment instead of beneath it. This way, the total height could be kept below 2.9 m, which means the trucks can be transported on standard railway flatcars. The characteristic, cut-away corners of the otherwise box-shaped cab ensure compliance with the railway loading gauge. The cab of early production examples does not tilt forward for maintenance because the vehicles were still based on the amphibious prototypes. The tilting cab was only introduced in the mid-80s. The engine powers the front and rear axles via a torque converter, semi-automatic transmission and a transfer case. In the first batch KAT I, these components form a single, special unit. The later KAT I A1 series uses mass-produced and standard truck components. At the same time, this allowed to raise the number of gears from six to 16, and the theoretical top speed from 90 to about 130 km/h. This in turn led to much lower engine speeds at the usual top speed of 80 km/h, lowering fuel consumption. Vehicle voltage is standard 24 Volts. The tow hitch is a standard NATO coupling suitable for towing trailers even in difficult terrain, although they must be equipped with the matching lunette ring. For self-defense, the vehicles have a swiveling machine gun mount for the Rheinmetall MG3. For the extraterritorial deployment of the Bundeswehr, some vehicles were fitted with an additional modular armour (modulare Schutzausstattung, MSA) to increase crew protection. Some new 3rd generation vehicles have the so-called vehicle protective equipment (Fahrzeugschutzausstattung, FSA) which is part of the vehicle design and factory-installed.  Variants (second generation) = LKW 5 t mil gl KAT I und KAT I A1 (4×4)  5 t gl KAT I covered wagon Introduced between 1976 and 1985, the types 451 and 461 are powered by a Deutz V8 Diesel engine, type F8L413F with 256 hp. These trucks are mainly flatbeds and covered wagons used to transport material and troops, carriers for the Kabine II of the fire control system (FERA) of the Light Artillery Rocket System (LARS) and as recovery vehicle for the KZO \\"Brevel\\" drone, equipped with a 1-ton crane by Atlas-Weyhausen. A specialty are the tank trucks based on the 5 t mil gl. With the tank attachment (\\"Tankaufsatz\\", TA) with pump, either with 1x 4600 l or 2x 2300 l tanks, they exceed the max. gross weight by one ton. After tests and with the consent of the tire manufacturer, it was decided to increase the tire pressure to compensate. All of these vehicles have a certificate of exemption. In contrast to type 451, the type 461 vehicles are equipped with a 5-ton winch with 30m of steel cable, denoted by the letter \\"w\\" in their designation (5 t mil glw). The cable can be played out to the front and to the rear. Almost all of the 2,073 winch-equipped trucks went to the army branch. Between 1986 and 1993, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) ordered further vehicles which could be airlifted in Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Transall C-160 transport aircraft. This new generation, termed KAT I A1, had some minor improvements over the first generation and some slight modifications. For example, the fixed cab was modified to expedite changing the engine. For airlift, the cab received a bolt-on hardtop.  LKW 7 t mil gl KAT I and KAT I A1 (6x6)  THW truck with loading crane and aluminum drop sides Multiple rocket launcher 110 SF on MAN 6x6 7t gl (Lars2) The 7-ton payload trucks were the second vehicle of the second generation of MAN Kat1 series trucks. These are very similar to the 5-ton truck but with a second, powered rear axle and a more powerful air-cooled 320 hp Deutz engine with turbocharger and intercooler. The second rear axle is powered by a fixed drive through the first one. MAN produced five types of these between 1977 and 1985. The types 452, 462 (with winch) and 463 served as flatbed trucks, carriers for the reconnaissance drone CL289, carriers for the LARS multiple rocket launcher, and with engineer units as a tractor for the mine-laying trailer 85 (MiV85) and the three-axle flatbed trailer 15 t. The type 453 was built as a dump truck with winch for the engineer units and a container truck for the medical corps. The fifth type of the follow-up generation was a carrier for the folding pontoon bridges. This type 455 has a lengthened wheelbase and flatbed to carry all components of the bridge and the M-Boot 3 motorboat. Like the type 462, it also has a 5-ton winch. In total, MAN produced 3,500 KAT I trucks of the 7-ton class. In the early 1980s, the Luftwaffe ordered additional vehicles as it had done with the 5-ton version. Between 1986 and 1993, MAN supplied vehicles of the improved KAT I A1 version for the MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system. The truck served as carrier for the fire control and engagement control systems as well as the electric power plant 2×150 kW and the antenna mast group.  LKW 10 t mil gl KAT I (8x8)  The final member of the KAT-I family is the four-axle, 10-ton version. Equipped with a 320 hp Deutz engine, turbocharger and intercooler, this truck is used by the supply units on the division, brigade and corps level of the German army. It has an extended bed and is used to supply the combat units with mass consumables like ammunition and fuel. Between 1976 and 1985, MAN built two versions. Type 454 only had a 5-ton winch by Rotzler and depended on fork lift trucks and the like. The type 464 had a 1-ton loading crane by Atlas-Weyhausen, mounted in the middle of the bed to the left. Because of the crane, this type can only carry nine EUR-pallets.

The 15 t mil gl BR A1 trucks, modified with a wider track of 2,900 mm, served as carriers and launcher systems of the Roland and Patriot weapon systems. The missiles are transported with a standard chassis truck with flatbed and 2.5-ton swiveling crane by Atlas. The four-axle truck is powered by a Deutz 8-cylinder Diesel engine with 360 hp, turbocharger and intercooler. Like the 5-, 7- and 10-ton classes, some of the vehicles have a Rotzler winch. Introduced on 19 January 2006, the COBRA counter-battery radar also uses surplus chassis of the KAT I A1 generation. Bundeswehr replacement On 6 July 2017 Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles announced it had entered a framework agreement with the German Bundeswehr to supply 2271 MAN HX2 trucks under the Bundeswehr’s Unprotected Transport Vehicle (UTF) programme. UTF will replace the older KAT 1 trucks. The contract award has a potential value of around €900 million. An initial order for 558 trucks with a value of around €240 million was placed, this including special tools and training support. Delivery was to take place during the 2018-2021 timeframe. RMMV announced on 12 June 2019 that the Bundeswehr had placed an order with the company for a second batch of unprotected transport vehicles. The order calls for 252 trucks (161 5-tonne and 91 15-tonne) and is valued at EUR92 million. The 252 vehicles ordered will be delivered during 2019 and deliveries will follow those of the original 558 trucks ordered at contract signing, the delivery timeline for these now expedited.

The country's highest mountains, the Caucasus, are confined to younger orogens. East European craton The European part of Russia lies on the East European platform, a region up to wide covered by more than of metamorphosed sediments dating back to the Riphean stage (middle to late Proterozoic, from 1,400 to 800 million years ago). These sediments lie on the East European craton, a remnant of Precambrian continental crust composed of magmatic and metamorphic rocks. The East European craton itself was created between 2.0 and 1.7 billion years ago when the microcontinents of Fennoscandia, Sarmatia and Volgo-Uralia collided. Timan Ridge The Timan Ridge ( – Timansky Kryazh) lies west of the Northern Ural mountains. It strikes northwest–southeast, extending from the settlement of Troitsko-Pechorsk to the Kanin Peninsula. This ridge can be correlated with outcrops on the Varanger Peninsula which together form the Timan-Varanger belt. The Timan-Varanger belt consists of Neoproterozoic (late Precambrian) sediments that were metamorphosed and deformed during the Timanian (or Baikalian) orogeny, a late Neoproterozoic mountain-building event coincident with the Cadomian orogeny in western Europe. Timan-Pechora Basin The Timan-Pechora Basin is a sedimentary basin that lies between the Timan Ridge and the Urals foreland basin. The basin extends into the southern part of the Barents sea and includes Kolguyev Island. It is covered by of sediments that were deposited during a series of marine regression and transgression events from the Proterozoic to the Cenozoic. The eastern basin was deformed when the Ural mountains were formed. The Basin is further divided into the Izhma-Pechora basin, Pechora-Kolva basin, Khoreiver basin and the Northern Pre-Urals. Volgo-Uralian Block The Volgo-Uralian Block is a basement of Archean craton covered by younger sediments, making up the eastern third of the East European Craton. This crystalline basement is made up of amphibolite to granulite facies, mostly forming domes. Granitoids deformed into gneisses are contained. The sedimentary rocks covering these domes are of Neoproterozoic to Phanerozoic age. Caucasus Mountains The Arabian plate has been converging towards the East European craton at 29 mm/yr; however, subduction has not occurred because of the presence of three blocks separating the plate and craton. The convergence has forced up the Caucasus Mountains. The core of the mountains is mostly composed of metasedimentary Paleozoic rocks. Deformation outside the core has mostly taken place on the southern slopes of the mountains; however, there is some deformation on the North slopes. This deformation is differentiated on the north slopes from East to West. In the west, some thrusting to the North of the Crest has taken place into the Kuban Basin. When the thrusting die out the north slopes of the central Greater Caucasus form a basement uplift, forming a monocline dipping North. Dagestan to the Eastern end of the range is the where most thrusting to the North occurs and has formed a folded zone of sediments, overlying some of the Terek Basin. Caspian Basin The Caspian Basin is a system of basins and platforms. It is divided into smaller basins, in the North, the North Caspian Basin. The north is a basin at the edge of the cratons to the north. It is composed of Paleozoic carbonate platforms. The North Basin overlies a basement of European Craton. Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments deposited by a variety of methods have covered the continental crust. Ural orogen The Ural Mountains, a 2,500 kilometre (1,600 mi) long mountain chain that runs north–south at approximately 60° E longitude, formed in the Ural orogeny, a long series of mountain-building events occurring at the eastern margin of what is now the East European craton in association with its collision with another microcontinent (the Kazakhstania terrane) to the east. The first phase of orogenic development occurred in the late Devonian and early Carboniferous, when volcanic island arcs developed and accreted to the continental margin. During the subsequent collision stage, extensive folding, faulting, and metamorphism occurred. Deformation during the collision stage propagated from the south northwards, reaching the Pay-Khoy mountains during the Jurassic. The strong influence of strike-slip movements during the orogeny caused the unusual straightness of the mountain chain. West Siberian basin Western Siberian plain on a satellite map of North Asia. The West Siberian basin lies between the Ural mountains and the Siberian craton to its east. It corresponds to the geographic region of the West Siberian plain. Deposition in rift valleys resulting from prolonged subsidence of the Triassic Koltogor-Urengoy graben in an intra-cratonic sag basin beginning in the Jurassic has resulted in a thick 'basin fill' of sedimentary deposits ranging from Jurassic to Cenozoic in age. There are two major north–south trending rift structures of Triassic age buried beneath the basin fill: the Urengoy and the Khudosey rift. These rifts are mainly filled with Lower Triassic basic volcanic rocks. The West Siberian basin and its offshore portions in the south Kara sea are the largest oil province in the world. It has an area of and the USGS estimates oil and gas reserves of 360 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the basin. Yenisey fold belt Dividing the Siberian craton from the West Siberian basin is the Yenisey fold belt, which extends about , with NW-SE strike. This belt is divided into northern and southern regions by the Angara fault which has left slip. Much of the rock was formed by Neoprotozoic accretion. North of the fault, the area is made up of thrust sheets divided into three primarily Neoproterozoic terranes, the East Angara, Central Angara and the Isakov. Each one overrides another, and volcanism is generally limited to the Central and Isakov terranes. South of the fault are the Predivinsk terrane, made of island arc accretion, and the Angara-Kan micro-craton, which is sometimes considered separate from the fold belt. Siberian craton Central Siberian Plateau's location in Asia. The Siberian craton (or West-Siberian craton) coincides with the Central Siberian plateau that lies between the Yenisei and Lena rivers. In the west it borders the West Siberian basin. The Yenisei-Katanga trough lies in the north. In the south lies the Central Asian fold belt, the Baikal rift and the Mongol-Okhotsk fold belt. The eastern border is the Verkhoyansk-Kolyma orogenic system. The Siberian craton formed in the Precambrian and is largely covered by sedimentary and volcanic rocks of more recent age. Precambrian rocks are exposed in two distinct uplifts, the Anabar massif in the northeast and the Aldanian shield in the southeast. Other basement outcrops include Olenyok, Sharyzhalgay and the raised Southern Yenisei horst. Basins include the Tunguska basin, the Vilui basin (Viluiskaya-Tunguska syncline), the Low- Angara (Angara-Lena trough) basin, and the Kan-Taseeva basin. The volcanically produced Siberian Traps, the largest flood basalts of the Phanerozoic (the last 542 million years), mantle about 40 percent of the Siberian craton. The Siberian craton is known for its large mineral resources. The town of Norilsk is the world's largest supplier of nickel. In 2011 one-fifth of the world's production of this metal came from Russia. Verhoyansk-Chukotka collision zone Lena River and Verkhoyansk Range (East Siberia). The Verhoyansk- Chukotka collision zone is commonly divided into the Verhoyansk-Kolyma and the Novosibirsk-Chukotka (or Novosibirsk-Chukchi) orogens. It stretches from the Lena river in the west to the Chukchi Peninsula in the east. Verkhoyansk- Kolyma orogen The Verkhoyansk-Kolyma orogen is composed of three parts: the Verkhoyansk fold-and-thrust belt, the Chersky collisional zone, and the Kolyma-Omolon microcontinent. The Verkhoyansk fold-and-thrust belt consists of a sedimentary succession, most of which was deposited between the Carboniferous and Middle Jurassic. The Lena River runs along the most frontal, or most western thrust of the Verkhoyansk fold and thrust belt. In the east of the Verkhoyansk lies the Chersky collisional belt. It consists of late Permian to Jurassic oceanic turbidites and volcanic deposits that are folded and were intruded by molten granite in the Cretaceous. The Kolyma-Omolon microcontinent formed when the Prikolyma and Omolon terranes collided with the Alazeya island arc (or Alazeya-Oloy volcanic arc). When the Kolyma-Omolon microcontinent collided with the Siberian craton the sedimentary stack of the Verhoyansk was folded and uplifted. Deformation took place between the Middle Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous. Novosibirsk-Chukotka orogen The Novosibirsk-Chukotka orogen lies in the northeasternmost part of Russia on the Chukchi Peninsula and also is exposed on the island of New Siberia, Anzhu Islands. The orogen is composed of metamorphic basement rocks and cover made up of shallow water sediments, deposited between the Permian and the Triassic. The Chukchi massif is an outcrop of Precambrian basement that stretches to the Seward Peninsula in Alaska. The Novosibirsk-Chukotka orogen is connected under the Chukchi Sea with the Brooks fold-and-thrust belt in Alaska. Central Asian Orogenic Belt The Central Asian Orogenic Belt is an orogen that covers much of Central Asia, extending from the Urals to the Pacific and dividing the Siberian and Eastern European cratons from the North China and Tarim cratons. It has been accepted that the belt was formed by accretion, but there is debate over the relative timing and nature of the various accretions. The accretion orogens form one of the largest areas of continental growth, representing 800 Ma of development. The part of the Belt in Russia is believed to have formed when the Kokchetav and Altai-Mongolian terranes collided with the Siberia Craton. The Altai Structures reach into Russia, representing the extent of a mobile belt primarily lying south of the border. This is known as the Altai-Sayan orogen and is part of the belt present in Russia, along with the Transbaikalia and Primorje orogens. Baikal-Stanovoy Region The Baikal- Stanovoy region is commonly held to be caused by various factors to account for the differing structures throughout the region. The Baikal-Stanovoy seismic belt underlies the region and is a long thin activity region. Compressive stresses dominate the eastern Stanovoy Ranges, whereas the Baikal rift zone is an extension zone. Baikal Rift Zone The Baikal rift zone is an extension zone separating the Siberian platform from the Sayan Baikal range. This zone is revealed by a series of basins more than long. Some strike-slip action also takes place in the area. The driving forces of the rift are unknown; however, possibilities include the subduction of the Pacific Plate and the collision of the Indian subcontinent with Eurasia. Locally, there may be a mantle up-welling driving the extension. The area was originally characterized by Precambrian and Paleozoic northeast-southwest fold and thrust belts. Volcanism began in the late Cretaceous in limited areas, but is mostly limited to the Miocene. It is also the age of sedimentary rocks in some basins, and the same series lasted into the Eocene. Rifting resumed beginning in the Oligocene, and is commonly held to have increased since the middle Pliocene, causing the formation of basins in the form of grabens. The new rift structure may follow the Precambrian and Paleozoic faults. Magmatic activity and rifting may also be independent events. Outside of the grabens basalt volcanics erupted from either end of the rift system during the uplift. The grabens mostly spread without releasing magma, except the Tunka depression. Dzhugdzhur and Stanovoy Ranges The Dzhugdzhur Range and Stanovoy Range are two eastern mountain ranges, where the Stonovoy is west of the Dzhugdzhur. Together the ranges make up a folded block structure, which first formed during the Archean and Proterozoic. The Stanovoy range is composed of granodiorite batholiths, mostly of the Udskaya series, which contains Mesozoic massifs in the form of intrusions of granite, granodiorite, and diorite. Seismic activity in the area is found in an east trending narrow zone, called the Stanovoy strike-slip zone. In the range, this belt is revealed by strike-slip displacement. This left fault joins the Sea of Okhotsk to the Sakhalin deformation zones. The belt formed by this zone extends to lake Baikal. The area is under compressive stresses. The Dzhugdzhur range has a basement formed out of a block which is from the early Proterozoic. It is sometimes considered part of the Aldan Shield. It contains a late Archean granulite basement. This basement can be broken into two sequences, the lower is primarily a plagiogneiss-enderbite, and the upper is made up of biotite and gneisses and garnets mixed with biotite. Okhotsk-Chukotka Volcanic Belt Map of the Okhotsk Plate and its neighbouring plates. The Okhotsk-Chukotka Volcanic Belt stretches from the settlement of Okhotsk and runs along the northern shore of the Sea of Okhotsk. In the Shelikhov Gulf the belt runs northeast across most of the Chukchi Peninsula and then bends southeast and runs along the Pacific shoreline and terminates between the peninsula and St. Lawrence Island. The Okhotsk-Chukotka Volcanic Belt was formed during the Cretaceous by the subduction of the Kula or Isanagai oceanic plate under the Verkhoyansk-Chukotka orogen. The activity ended with the subduction moving farther east. Mineral resources found in the Okhotsk-Chukotka belt include gold, silver, tin and mercury. Pacific rim orogenies=Kuril Islands arc The Kuril arc is a 2,300 kilometre (1,400 mi) long chain of volcanic islands stretching from the Kamchatka peninsula to Hokkaido (Japan). The islands formed as a part of the Kurile-Kamchatkan subduction system when the Pacific Plate started to subduct under the Okhotsk Plate during the Paleogene. This process is still active today with 40 of its 100 volcanoes being active. Currently the subduction is oblique and progressing at per year. The Kuril- Kamchatka Trench on the pacific side of the islands is one of the deepest ones known, with parts reaching in depth. In the north the Kurile island arc connects with the Aleutian arc at the Kamchatka-Aleutian junction. West Kamchatka orogen The West Kamchatka orogen is a regional geosynclinal complex of the Upper Cretaceous, which is superimposed on a granite-gneiss and schist-basic foundation, and which, after folding, was overlain by Paleogene- Neogene rocks. On the Central and Eastern Kamchatka-Olyutor systems of the Upper Cretaceous is built up a complex of paleogene volcanic-sedimentary strata. During the Late Pliocene – Early Pleistocene in the central zone there developed large basaltic shield volcanoes. The Eastern Zone is characterized by current day volcanism (28 active volcanoes), coinciding with recent graben- like structures. Koryak orogeny The Koryak fold and thrust belt consists of Lower Palaeozoic to Cenozoic terranes, including early Carboniferous metamorphic terranes composed of folds, domes and shear zones with related high-pressure and low-temperature metamorphism. The latest Jurassic to early Cretaceous (early Albian) thrusting was accompanied by dextral strike-slip faulting, and this formed imbricated (overlapping) fans of thrusts and folds with southeast vergence, creating a broken formation and serpentinite mélange. Some of the rocks were metamorphosed to blueschist. These structures are now overlapped by Upper Albian sedimentary rocks with an angular unconformity. A late Cretaceous to Cenozoic deformational event characterized by significant sinistral strike-slip displacement at higher crustal levels resulted in a new set of structures and the rotation of pre-existing structures. The latest Jurassic to early Cretaceous (early Albian) thrusting, and a late Cretaceous to Cenozoic deformational event correspond to assumed proto-Pacific plate motions based on palaeomagnetic data. Sakhalin Cenozoic orogeny Sakhalin. The Sakhalin Cenozoic orogeny is divided into East and West zones separated by the Central Sakhalin graben. Oil and gas are associated with the North Sakhalin basin, and there are coal-bearing deposits in mountains associated with the middle Miocene. Geology of the Russian Arctic=Kara terrane Severnaya Zemlya and the northern part of the Taimyr Peninsula formed an independent microcontinent during the Paleozoic, the Kara Terrane or North Kara Terrane. It consists of a Neoproterozoic basement, consisting of metamorphosed sedimentary rocks intruded by granites, which is covered by Upper Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. The North Kara Terrane collided with Siberia around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. This collision, which is related to the Caledonian orogeny, is called the Severnaya Zemlya episode.

It is also a therapy strategy to teach their families how to foster their success in recovery.Duncan, Melanie. \\"Dr\\". THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE-BASED CLEARINGHOUSE FOR CHILD WELFARE. Retrieved 26 March 2019. The goals of MST are to lower rates of criminal behavior in juvenile offenders. There are several things MST therapy must include: integration of empirically based treatment to acknowledge a large variety of risk factors that may be influencing the behavior; rewards for positive changes in behavior and environment to ultimately empower caregivers; and many thorough quality assurance mechanisms that focus on completing objectives set in treatment Medical uses A 2017 meta-analysis of family-based treatments for serious juvenile offenders found \\"modest, yet long-lasting, treatment effects\\" in reducing antisocial behavior and improving other outcomes when compared with conventional community services. A meta-analysis of MST in 2014 reported small improvements in delinquency, psychological problems, and substance use, particularly with younger juveniles. In 2012 a literature review compared common treatments including cognitive behavioral therapy, 12-step facilitation, multisystemic therapy, psychoeducation, and motivational interviewing in an attempt to identify the best treatments for substance- abusing adolescents with conduct problems. The authors concluded that family- based interventions produced superior outcomes, and that MST had \\"the most compelling evidence\\", noting that the providers are often well trained and supervised. Methods Multisystemic therapy (MST) is a home and community based intervention for juvenile offenders. It draws upon many practices from strategic family therapy, structural family therapy, and cognitive behavior therapy in intensive interventions over four to six months. It is based in part on ecological systems theory. Treatment is individualized depending on the social systems surrounding the youth. Although treatment is highly variable, it always includes nine core principles. Which are: # The client exists within a series of systems # Practitioners use existing positive systems to help client create change # Interventions should include increased responsibility of family members # MST is present-focused and action-oriented # Each interventions targets a specific behavior # MST interventions should match the developmental age of the child for which they are created # Family members are needed to enact interventions # Evaluation of interventions occur from multiple perspectives # Each intervention is made to be used over long terms and in multiple settings History The MST method was originally a collection of procedures practiced by Dr. Scott Henggeler in the 1970s. He soon brought in Charles Bourdain and Molly Brunk, two of his doctoral students, to help with the theory’s documentation. To bring their project to fruition, Henggeler, Bourdain, and Brunk combined evidence-based practice models with the positive aspects of other behavior theories, and created the calling card of MST by emphasizing family preservation and strengthening of relationships among juvenile delinquents.Claiborne, Christy Ann, \\"Multisystemic Therapy: Why there is a need for it, what it is, how it works, and an intern's experiences in a mental health agency utilizing multisystemic therapy\\" (2002). University of Tennessee Honors Thesis Projects. https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_chanhonoproj/524 Since then there have been a few tweaks to the original design so in 1990 MST as it is known today was born. For being so new, MST has been tested many times in many settings, and in most it has shown to have the longest lasting positive effects for troubled youth and their families.Office of the Surgeon General (US); National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (US); National Institute of Mental Health (US); Center for Mental Health Services (US). Youth Violence: A Report of the Surgeon General. Rockville (MD): Office of the Surgeon General (US); 2001. [Table, Multisystemic Therapy (MST)]. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44295/table/A13142/ After the finalization of the MST method, the MST Institute was founded as a nonprofit corporation to be \\"responsible for setting quality assurance standards and monitoring the implementation of Multisystemic Therapy in all programs worldwide\\"  Use in the Juvenile Justice System  Practitioners increasingly use Multisystemic Therapy to help youth within the juvenile justice system to reintegrate into society rather than standard probation or treatment as usual (TAU). MST differs from the usual tactics in that it targets criminogenic factors related to an individual's social environment, particularly within the family system. It has been identified as a promising treatment model for juvenile offenders by the U.S. Surgeon General in reducing rates of recidivism.

According to INAH, this archaeological site is locally called Cerro de la Campana, due to the popular belief that in one of its buildings or mounds a gold bell lies buried. Geographical charts assign the locality Cerro la Cantera since even today pink stone is extracted from quarry deposits. This quarry is of high quality and very useful to construct modern buildings. The site is also known by Huijazoo, which means \\"war fortress\\" in the Zapotec Language. Historical brief According to the Municipalities Encyclopedia, Suchilquitongo name is a contraction of the Nahuatl word Xochiliquitonco, consisting of Xochitl, \\"flower\\", Quilitl (Sp), quelitón, quelite, and Tontli, \\"diminutive\\" of Co, \\"in\\"; means: \\"in the flowered quelites\\". According to studies conducted by archaeologist Enrique Mendez, this human settlement presumably developed approximately 1000 BCE., becoming part of a social nucleus already properly structured, with a correct social formation, territory and proper government forms, by the year 300 or 400 CE., thus forming the main seat of which was the high guijazoo lordship, with chosen buildings where guijazoo powers sat, forming a horseshoe figure, between the towns of San Pablo Huitzo in the north and Santiago Suchilquitongo to the south. The latter, where on the “cerro de la campana” is located the famous Tomb number 5, which has been described as the Zapotec art “Sistine Chapel” which in 1985, was a source of controversy among authorities and people of Santiago Suchilquitongo and San Pablo Huitzo, who claimed ownership of the territory where this archaeological jewel is located, rather this dispute arises from a misunderstanding, when it was mentioned that Tomb 5 was found in cerro de la campana. Both Huitzo and Suchilquitongo, by coincidence, each have such a named hill within their respective territories. Suchilquitecos also call their own hill, “El Mogote”, or the Mound of the Old Lady. On the mound a fortress was discovered, decorated with serpents and a figure representing Quetzalcoatl, who was worshiped by Mesoamerican cultures. However, according to the Municipalities Encyclopedia for San Pablo Huitzo the name in Spanish means “Espinazo” (Ridge). Also Huexolotitlan means place where there are Guajolotes (Turkey). Huexolotl, Turkey; titlan place of. The Zapotec called this town Huijazoo, which means: Atalaya place of warriors. The historical research of San Pablo Huitzo notes that the town has a history dating back to 1200 BCE. Approximately, history tells us that by the year 1400 CE., the place was known with the Huijazoo name and years later, when it was conquered by the Aztecs, the town was then named Gueixolotitlan and by the 1700s its name was again changed to what is known today. Site history  As a result of archaeological explorations, constructive evidence, and human occupation evidence suggest that the oldest remains, within the Huitzo municipality, are those of Barrio del Rosario and the latest or more recent evidence is located within the territorial limits of the municipality of Santiago Suchilquitongo. The “Cueva de la Vieja” complex has not yet been explored. It is believed that the settlement evolution dates back to the earliest times of human development in the Oaxaca valleys, since ancient human evidence have been found from 2799 years ago in the known Barrio del Rosario, in Huitzo. Local historians and some scholars link this site with the mythical Huijazo or Atalaya War where Zapotec defended their country against Mixtec invaders, fact that remains to be documented by the archaeological record. So far it is not known the year in which this ceremonial center was abandoned. The Site The architectural complex is located on the summit of a hill, at a height of 150 meters above the floor of the Valley of Oaxaca, provides an exceptional viewing position, which on a clear day provides a view of up to forty kilometers, with clear air and accurate view. The site is on a small artificially leveled crest, which allows foundation for eight buildings more than four meters high and with foundation bases of up to 25 m per side. At its apogee, the hill slopes were contained by rough walls which were coated with flattened stucco lime, giving the complex a fortress aspect. During the ascent to the Summit the remains of platforms and smaller buildings as well as steps are notorious; all of them are coated with lime stucco so it is considered that access should have been restricted to common people. Three of the partially restored buildings show simple walls superimposed with recessed stairways against its façade. One is highlighted by lateral stairways main access. Each of the eight buildings has on top, a single room with a short hallway in front. Due to recovered evidence, possibly priests, sorcerers and nobles used them to perform ceremonies, astronomical observations, and human sacrifices. It is deduced by the decorations that some of these buildings had on their facades that such acts perhaps were dedicated to the rain god Cocijo cult. Future archaeological excavations may verify the hypothesis that each of the eight existing buildings contains internal tombs; this sector may be a necropolis. The complex longitudinal axis was drawn from east to east, leaving the floors of the three existing plazas at different levels in relation to the sunken patio sunk or ballgame court. The level difference is evident between building 1 platform and the sunken patio floor, 6.50 meters, while the difference between building 3 patio and the floor of the Main Plaza is just 4.6 meters. Tomb No. 5 An important finding was made in 1985 with the discovery of tomb 5, located in building 1. Together with the Monte Alban 105 tomb, both contemporary, these could be considered as the most beautiful archaeology funeral samples in the Oaxaca region. This tomb is below the building at a depth of about six and a half meters, same elevation of the sunken patio floor in the Center of the complex. The Tomb was built during the Zapotec culture classical period (650-900 CE)., hence it is about 1240 years old; some scholars believe that it was used at least twice after the Great Lord who originally ordered its construction for his own burial ceremony, known as “Señor 12 Monos (12 monkey) who probably ruled this land. Entrance is down nine steps leading to a hall, that at the time of its discovery was sealed with a large stone block. Two stones carved in bas-relief with the representation of richly dressed priests form the entry, on top is a large monolithic lintel holding a feline head with open jaws, a precious bird head sticks out the mouth. This realistic representation is framed with abstract God Cocijo elements such as the headdress on the feline as ornament, and symbols of defended mountains, water and force winds to the sides of the head. Is noteworthy that the entire composition is embedded inside of a double scapular panel, which except in exceptional cases, only was used as a decorative element of the facades of monumental buildings of the classic period in the valleys of Oaxaca. Past the portico is the antechamber, which resembles a courtyard flanked by two niches with east and west lintels, communicating the main burial chamber by three short steps which are inserted on a pair of double scapular boards. Each of the existing room spaces has finely bas-reliefs carved jambs painted red, representing governing couples preceding the rule of “12 mono”. The antechamber walls are painted with frescos from the ceremony of burial of the original Tomb; ceremony attended by warriors, priests, whiners (plañideras), musicians, sorcerers and fantastic characters, as well as ballgame players, all of this with a polychromy handling never seen in similar funerary representation. The access lintel to the main chamber is richly decorated with a character who wearing a helmet with God Cocijo attributes and the symbol of “bundle of years” that some wish to identify with the intertwined triangles that prehispanic astronomers used in their measurements. Both described lintels decorations were made in fine stone masonry coated with lime plaster. Red dominates all antechamber space, as representing death for the Zapotec. The burial chamber is a masonry decorated rectangle with frescos from the Lords of the villages under the domination of “12 mono” at the time of his death and at least sixteen individuals dressed as ballgame players, some with the helmet in hand and preceded by a couple of warriors. At the back of the camera is a fine bas- relief carved stonework piece, painted red representing the transmission charge from “12 Mono” parents; “11 movimiento” and lady “4 turquesa”, made in favor of his son and his wife then, lady “10 Mono”. The magnificent carving of face details of the represented characters is striking, as well as their clothing and furnishings used to sit, particularly those used by the main character, located in the far right of the top box of the tombstone. The archaeological site of the Cerro de la Campana lacks public services at the time. In the Centre of the village of Santiago Suchilquitongo, visitors can visit the Community Museum that has a replica of 5 Tomb, as well as some of the pieces found in the interior. Tomb 5 is closed to the public due to the fragile nature of the paintings contained within. It can be entered only enter with INAH permission. Site Museum The archaeological site lacks public services. In the Centre of the village of Santiago Suchilquitongo, is a Community Museum that has a replica of Tomb 5, as well as some of the pieces found in its interior. In San Pablo Huitzo, is another small museum with prehispanic items and colonial religious art. Huijazoo site Orientation George DeLange is an astronomer and has been one for over thirty five years. He noticed one unusual alignment, the entire plan of this city seems to be on a very different alignment than most of the cities in Mesoamerica. It seems to be aligned on a SE to NW alignment. He suspects that alignment may have been to the solstices rather than to equinox, as most of the Mesoamerican cities show.

Its population was 5,102 in 2009. The village is in an area in the north-western part of the Fergana Valley where the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan meet. The settlement is at least one thousand years old and is mentioned in medieval, Arabic and Persian scriptures under the name Isbid Bulan.http://www.fergananews.com/article.php?id=1980 The hamlet of Safed- Bulan, located near the village of Ala-Buka at the junction of the Padisha Ata and the Chanach-Sai rivers, is named after Bulan (woman), a black African maiden. According to legend, Bulan came to the lands of Central Asia with the army of Arabic warriors led by her beloved and, perhaps, her master -Shah- Jarir (grandson of Prophet Mohammad). Apparently this wave of the Muslim conquests was a successful one, since historical sources tell that the local tribal inhabitants \\"pretended to accept\\" a new religion of Islam. According to the legend, the locals attacked while the Arabs had laid down their weapons for their Friday prayers. While some warriors were able to flee, many defenseless Arabs were beheaded on the spot. Bulan unsuccessfully searched for her lover who, it is believed, had fled back to Arabia. Though everyone was prohibited from burying the dead, Bulan gathered the 2700 heads of the decapitated Arabs, washed them of blood in the river and buried them all. She was blessed for her deed by becoming completely white all over. Hence the name: Safed (or safid) Bulan (or Bulon)(White Woman). Some historians believe that Safed Bulan's hair turned white due to the shock she had experienced witnessing the massacre. When Safed Bulan died, she was buried near the slain Arab warriors. Her grave became a place of pilgrimage, or a mazar ( Arabic for holy mausoleum). Kirin mechet, the place where the warriors were beheaded, stands nearby on the left. According to the legend, the rock that stands at the mazar's entry marks the exact spot where Safed Bulan washed the heads of the warriors. Women visit the mausoleum to pray and ask for Safed-Bulan's blessings. Those who have a hard time conceiving children visit in order to touch the \\"fertility rock\\" that lies in the small yard of the mausoleum. Ferghana's ruler Shah Fazil (born:Mahmud Ibn Nasir,a firm believer in Islam and a son of Shah Jarir) is also buried nearby in the 11th-12th century Shakh Fazil mausoleum that is named after him. His mausoleum is a place of pilgrimage as well; it contains Islamic art, Arabic ornaments, passages from the Qur'an and quotes in Persian. The Shah Fazil mausoleum is on the wait list to be added to the UNESCO registry. Descriptions of the site appear in several scholarly studies.Cohn-Wiener, Ernst. \\"A Turanic monument of the twelfth century AD.\\" Ars Islamica 6.1 (1939): 88-91. In 2002, the U.S. Embassy in Kyrgyzstan funded a restoration of the mausoleum. \\"The tale of Safed Bulan\\" (Сафед Булон қиссаси), a literary document written by Shah Khakim Halisa in 1811, is a historical resource that offers information on various mazars of Central Asia.

Linguists had important positions in the early Soviet state, as they were needed to develop alphabets for languages that previously had never been written. In the 1920s, language began to be seen as a social phenomenon, and Russian and Soviet linguists tried to give a sociological explanation to features of language. At the same time, Soviet linguists sought to develop a \\"Marxist\\" linguistics, as opposed to the early theories that were viewed as bourgeois. Based on this, linguists focused more on the spoken forms of the language, and devoted more time to the study of non-standard dialects than previous linguists had done. This can be seen in the work of Boris Alexandrovich Larin and Lev Petrovich Iakubinskii. The leading linguist of the early Soviet era was Nicholas Marr, known for his Japhetic theory. The theory suggested that the Kartvelian languages had a common origin with the Semitic languages. He also applied the idea of class struggle to the development of language. After Marr died, a likely ghost-written article credited to Stalin blasted Marr's theory, stating \\"Soviet linguistics cannot be advanced on the basis of an incorrect formula which is contrary to the whole course of the history of peoples and languages.\\" Politically, World War II caused a rise in nationalism, which Japhetic theory argued against.

He played two seasons in the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1967–68 and 1968–69, winning the ABA Finals in 1968 as a member of the Pittsburgh Pipers. Early life Wright grew up in Texas and graduated from Aycock High School (Rockdale) in 1956. He was a four- sport star, playing football, basketball and track and field. He won state championships in both football and basketball during his senior year of 1955–56. College career Wright played basketball at the College of the Pacific from 1957–58 to 1959–60 (freshmen were not allowed to play varsity sports according to NCAA rules when he was in college.) When he became eligible as a sophomore in 1957–58, Wright burst onto the national basketball scene with per game averages of 13.2 points and 17.1 rebounds. A forward, his points per game average increased in each his junior and senior seasons (14.8 and 15.9, respectively) while his rebounding averages were tops in the nation. Wright's average of 25.1 rebounds per game as a junior and 22.4 per game as a senior are the top two in Pacific history, and he became the first player ever to repeat as the NCAA Division I season rebounding champion. He was named the West Coast Conference Co-Player of the Year in his final two collegiate seasons as well, first sharing the honors with San Francisco's Mike Farmer followed by LaRoy Doss of Saint Mary's. Professional career After his collegiate career ended, Wright was selected in the second round (16th overall) of the 1960 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. He never played in the National Basketball Association, however. He spent two seasons playing in the ABA in 1967–68 as a member of the Pittsburgh Pipers and then in 1968–69 when the team relocated to become the Minnesota Pipers. During his rookie season, Pittsburgh won the ABA Finals, four games to three, over the New Orleans Buccaneers. It was the first ABA championship in the league's history. For the season, Wright played in 17 games and averaged 3.4 points and 6.4 rebounds. He played another 13 games during the playoffs in which he averaged 2.0 points and 5.6 rebounds en route to the championship. When the franchise relocated to Minnesota for the following season, Wright remained on the team but only played in 10 games and averaged a diminished 0.8 points and 3.0 rebounds. Since he was 30 years old at that point, Wright's career came to a close when he was not re-signed after the season.

It was unique in that the revolver was clasped in a fist with the barrel protruding between two fingers and the entire handgun was squeezed in order to fire a round. History The Protector Palm Pistol was first patented and built in France in 1882 by Jacques Turbiaux and sold as the \\"Turbiaux Le Protector\\" or the \\"Turbiaux Disc Pistol\\". Later in 1883 it was built in the USA as The Protector by Minneapolis Firearms Co.. Peter H. Finnegan of Austin, Illinois bought the patent in 1892 and founded the Chicago Fire Arms Co. to make and market the pistols. In anticipation of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, he contracted the Ames Sword Company of Chicopee, Massachusetts to manufacture 15,000 pistols. Ames made 1,500 of the pistols by the deadline of the exhibition. Finnegan sued for damages and engaged in a lawsuit with Ames. The company countersued and settled with Finnegan, but, through the years, had amassed a large production run of 12,800 pistols. The company sold the inventory and abandoned the design by 1910. Remington manufactured the rimfire ammunition for this pistol, 32 Extra Short and alternatively 32 Protector, until 1920. Most Protectors were nickel-plated to prevent corrosion from being carried in close contact with the owner. These guns were shipped with hard rubber inserts for additional protection. Some varieties came with pearl inlays and a small percentage were blued. Operation The design of these pistols was based on that patented by Jacques E. Turbiaux of Paris. Turbiaux described his pistol as \\"A revolver which may be held in the hand with no part exposed except the barrel\\". The protector was designed to be the size of a pocketwatch and is a unique pistol in that it is not fired using a conventional trigger, but by the operator squeezing his or her fist when the pistol is in the hand.

A radical modernist, he joined the \\"Unity Men\\" and stressed a creedless \\"ethical basis\\" as the common element for churches.Excerpt from Robinson, David. The Unitarians and the Universalists, 1985, available at . He tried to move Unitarianism away from a Christian focus and became a prominent pacifist at the time of World War I. He was a founder and long-time editor of Unity, a liberal religious weekly magazine.Tauscher, Cathy and Peter Hughes. \\"Jenkin Lloyd Jones.\\" . Early life A view of Llandysul, once a hotbed of Welsh Unitarianism. Jenkin Lloyd Jones was born near Llandysul, a farming town in Cardiganshire, Wales. He was the seventh of ten children born to Richard Lloyd Jones and Mary Thomas James. In 1844, the family emigrated to the United States and settled in Ixonia, Wisconsin, supported by Richard's brother, also named Jenkin. After ten years, Richard and his family moved to Spring Green, Wisconsin. Civil War service and its influence Jenkin, often called \\"Jenk\\", enlisted in 1862 in the 6th Battery of the Wisconsin Volunteer Army. His military service included the battles of Vicksburg, Missionary Ridge, Chattanooga, Lookout Mountain and Atlanta. He suffered a broken foot at Missionary Ridge that required him to walk with a cane for the rest of his life. His experiences during the war convinced him that people must find another way to settle their differences. After he was mustered out of the army, Jenk became an outspoken pacifist. Jenk returned to the family farm in Wisconsin after the war. He soon told his family that he had had a religious experience and decided to study for the ministry. In 1866, he enrolled in the Meadville Theological School in Meadville, Pennsylvania, a Unitarian institution that later became part of Meadville Lombard Theological School. Many of his classmates were also veterans of the war, and he soon became a class leader. He examined the implications of the theory of evolution on ideas about God in his commencement paper, \\"Theological Bearings of Development Theory.\\" Marriage and family Jones met Susan Charlotte Barber during his time in Meadville. Susan Barber was born May 15, 1832 in New York as the eldest daughter of English immigrants, John Barber and Susan Cartwright. The Cartwrights were Unitarians and had moved to Meadville seeking a like-minded community. Susan studied informally at the theological school while working as secretary to the school's founder, Harm Jan Huidekoper, and his son, Professor Frederic Huidekoper.Tauscher, Cathy and Peter Hughes.\\"Susan Charlotte Barber Lloyd Jones.\\" They married after Jones graduation in 1870 and spent their honeymoon in Cleveland, Ohio at the annual meeting of the Western Unitarian Conference (WUC). Then the couple returned to Spring Green, where Jenk's mother died soon after. Jenkin and Susan had two children: Mary and Richard Lloyd Jones; Richard became the owner of the Wisconsin State Journal and then of the Tulsa Tribune. Career as a Unitarian minister=Missionary work Unity Chapel, Jones's rustic church in the Wyoming Valley. Jones became the minister of the Liberal Christian Church in Winnetka, Illinois in 1870. However, he resigned this position in less than a year because he felt it too limiting. He returned to Wisconsin to become a traveling missionary. As a missionary, he founded churches in Racine, Madison, Baraboo and Whitewater. He also worked with the First Independent Society of Liberal Christians in Janesville. In 1875, the WUC hired Jones part-time as Missionary Secretary. He travelled extensively, going as far as California, from then until 1882. His work in this position included helping to find ministers to fill vacant pulpits and attending conferences, installations, ordinations and dedications. In 1876, he was also named Corresponding Secretary of the WUC and liaison to the American Unitarian Association (AUA). Jones was also one of the founders of Unity, a weekly publication, in 1878. He became editor the following year and held that position for the rest of his life. The combination of pastoral duties and missionary work caused health problems, so Jones decided to quit his missionary position in 1880. Instead, the WUC made the Missionary Secretary a full-time position. Jones resigned the Janesville pastorate and retained his WUC job. He and his family moved to the new WUC headquarters in Chicago. All Souls Church (Chicago) The Jones family travelled to Wales in 1882, where Jenk preached and met with family members and other Unitarians. After they returned to Chicago, he met with a dozen members of the nearly defunct Fourth Unitarian Church. By the following year, he had led its reorganization as All Souls Church. In 1884, he resigned his position with the WUC to serve the rest of his life as minister of All Souls. In 1895, the church bought land for a new building that would house both the church and its related social services. The latter included a gymnasium, classrooms, library and reading rooms. This building was completed in 1905 and named the Abraham Lincoln Centre. Peace advocacy At the turn of the twentieth century, most Unitarians were peace advocates. Although Jenkin Lloyd Jones had served in the Civil War and believed that the ending of slavery was a positive outcome, he also believed that war was a bad thing. This caused him to preach openly against the Spanish–American War and the subsequent American intervention in the Philippines. In 1915, Henry Ford sponsored an international conference in Stockholm. He chartered a ship, thereafter known as the Henry Ford Peace Ship, to bring a large delegation of American peace activists to the conference. Jones was one of this delegation. The conference failed to stop the war and was largely discredited in the American press. Support for the war grew until the United States joined the conflict in 1917. The Chicago Peace Society did not speak out against the war, angering Jones to the point of withdrawing his membership. He continued to publicly oppose the war, both in speaking and writing. In 1918 Chicago's postmaster, citing the Emergency Act of 1917, prohibited the mailing of Unity. Jenk petitioned to have the suspension lifted. This was granted shortly before Jenk's death. Death of Susan and remarriage Susan Lloyd Barber's health began to decline in the mid-1890s. She suffered from hearing loss and severe headaches, which prevented her from participating in Jenk's work. Susan died of appendicitis in 1911. In 1915, Jenkin married Mrs. Edith Lackersteen, a long-time co-worker at the Abraham Lincoln Centre. Death Jenkin Lloyd Jones died September 12, 1918 in Tower Hill, Wisconsin. An obituary listed the cause of death as \\"shock following an operation.\\"New York Times. \\"Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones.\\" September 13, 1918.\\" Accessed October 31, 2010.

It premiered October 20, 2010 on Comedy Central in the United States. In the episode, Stan and Mr. Mackey suffer a hoarding disorder. In an attempt to find the cause for it, they get trapped in Mr. Mackey's dream. The episode spoofs the TV show Hoarders, Hoarding: Buried Alive, and the film Inception. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA-LV in the United States and MA15+(a) in Australia. Plot After Wendy expresses concern that Stan suffers from compulsive hoarding, he agrees to have it checked. A hoarding specialist named Dr. Chinstrap, as well as the rest of the student body, help Stan go through his locker, which is stuffed with a number of disgusting items, including a maggot-infested sandwich and broken toothbrush which Stan, who soon loses his composure, refuses to give up, shocking Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, Wendy and the rest of the school. They send him to Mr. Mackey, who does not know what hoarding is; Stan discovers that Mackey is a hoarder himself. Stan and Mackey, along with a sheep herder named Mr. Yelman (repeatedly misidentified as a sheep \\"hoarder\\"), are hooked up to a machine which Chinstrap and his assistant Dr. Pinkerton explains that they will help them figure out why they are hoarders by drifting them to their subconscious. Moments later in Mackey's subconscious he is being bullied by a boy named Billy Thompson, who threatens to attack Mackey at a field trip the next day. Mackey then runs into Stan and the sheep hoarder who, as the scientists explain in reality, are there because of the power of Mackey's dream. Within the dream, Stan goes home with Mackey and tries to talk him out of the dream, but Mackey instead plays with his Lite-Brite and other 70s-era toys and watches ZOOM. Randy insists he has to rescue his son from the dream despite Chinstrap's warning that he will be stuck there forever. The dream moves on to the next morning where Stan, Mackey, the sheep hoarder, and the kids board a bus for the field trip. Stan suddenly sees Randy, who is for some reason a butterfly. Stan asks if he has come to help but Randy reveals that, while that was his intention, he is more concerned with getting \\"butterfly poon\\". Pinkerton claims that they have called in another group of \\"experts\\" in the form of the main characters from Inception (one of them shapeshifting into NFL quarterback Matt Hasselbeck) to go into the dream to create a \\"dream within a dream\\" and rescue them, with Chinstrap providing boombox sounds recreating Inception's music theme during the explanation. The second group, the cast from Inception, comes in shooting at people before going into the dream, where they proceed to shoot even more people in the woods as the group arrives. Stan, the sheep hoarder and Mackey are introduced to Woodsy Owl, an owl with the tagline \\"give a hoot, don't pollute\\" before being put in with Billy and his two friends. Chinstrap and Pinkerton are now seen courting firefighters to get into the dream and begin trying to explain the events to Sharon (Compared to a taco inside of a taco inside a Taco Bell inside a KFC within a mall inside a dream), who claims it all sounds ridiculous and stupid. A pizza guy arrives and is sent in as well, as Sharon is told she does not understand because she is not smart. Within the dream, Mackey and Stan are running from the bullies when Stan convinces Mackey to stand up for himself. Mackey prepares for a fight. Back in reality, Chinstrap decides the dream has become too powerful, and at this point they must court \\"the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world\\" who is Freddy Krueger. While Freddy Krueger does not wish to come back, they convince him to help out a final time. Within Mackey's dream, the second group of experts arrive to kill Billy Thompson and the tormentors before the fire fighters arrive, which they assumed would cure Mackey and end the dream. But when they realized Mackey is not waking up, he remembers what happened, explaining he ran from the bullies and went into a shack, where someone talked nice to him but then touched him in a bad way. Mackey then comes upon that same shack and enters, revealing another young Mackey being sexually molested by Woodsy Owl. Woodsy then turns into a nightmarish monster, killing the sheep hoarder and overpowering the Inception cast before being killed from behind by Freddy Krueger. With Woodsy destroyed, everyone wakes up and Mackey explains he must have become a hoarder because of Woodsy's tagline about not polluting. Freddy is beyond remorse because he could not save the sheep herder (ironically the only one who recognizes him correctly as a shepherd). They suggest to Stan that he move on to his own therapy now, but he claims to have a better idea. He is then seen throwing out the items in his locker. Wendy and Kyle ask him what his problem was and Stan says that after what happened with Mackey, he does not want any therapy. Kyle suggests that maybe that \\"was your therapy\\". Finally, Chinstrap comes out again doing the Inception soundtrack as the episode ends. College Humor borrowings Upon the episode's release, Dan Gurewitch from the humor website CollegeHumor, noted several similarities between Insheeption and his own Inception parody video, \\"Inception Characters Don't Understand Inception\\", which he had made with David Young and first posted to the CollegeHumor website on July 19, 2010. He discovered that many lines from the South Park episode seemed to be lifted almost verbatim from their sketch. Matt Stone later issued an apology, admitting when they had intended to parody the complexity of Inception, they did not have a copy of the film to reference, instead turning to the internet for information on the film. Stone explained: > \\"We thought their joke was that a lot of those lines were actually in the > movie, and they were banging them against each other, and showing that the > Inception characters didn't even know Inception. That was a mistake, and it > was an honest mistake… It's just because we do the show in six days, and > we're stupid and we just threw it together. But in the end, there are some > lines that we had to call and apologize for.\\" Gurewitch has since said that their apology was accepted, and that he and Young plan to \\"meet up with Matt and Trey when they're in New York.\\"  Reception =Ratings In its original American broadcast on October 20, 2010, \\"Insheeption\\" was seen by 2.891 million viewers according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. The episode received a 1.8 rating/3 share, meaning it was seen by 1.8 percent of the population, and 3 percent of people watching television at the time of its broadcast. Among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49, the episode received a 1.6 rating/5 share, dropping three tenths in the ratings in stated demographic since the previous episode. Among male viewers between ages 18 and 34, the episode scored a 3.4 rating/11 share. Critical response  Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating. IGN gave the episode a score of 7 out of 10 and wrote: \\"This episode had a great premise, and I did find myself laughing a couple of times (Cartman's few lines in this story are hilarious), but this installment gave me the impression that the creative team weren't really trying that hard. I've said it before, but it bears repeating – it seems like these new episodes are more like Robot Chicken fare (no offense to you RC lovers out there, though South Park is not to be compared to Robot Chicken), than the usual stuff we've come to expect from SP. Maybe the team is distracted by other things, or maybe the debacle with the Mohammed episode took some wind out of their sails, but the spark seems to be missing, and I'm hoping it returns soon.\\" TVfanatic.com rated the episode 4 out of 5 and said, \\"We thought the episode was actually pretty spot on and fantastic.\\" Home release Insheeption, along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's fourteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.

He was Bishop of Cuenca (1272) and Burgos (1275) and Archbishop of Toledo (1280), the first official Primate of Spain (1285) and finally Cardinal-bishop of Albano (1298) at the curia Romana. His early career was that of an international scholar, before he settled into royal service. The future cardinal was born at Toledo in 1238 or 1239Francisco J. Hernández and Peter Linehan, The mozarabic cardinal: the life and times of Gonzalo Pérez Gudiel, Florence, 2004, p. 27 into the city's mozarab gentry, to alguacil alcalde Pedro Juanes and his wife Teresa Juanes, daughter of alguacil alcalde Juan Ponce.Balbina Caviró Martínez, \\"El linaje y las armas del arzobispo toledano Gonzalo Pétrez «Gudiel» (1280-1299)\\", Toletum, 57 (2012):131-169 The surname under which he is known, Gudiel, relates to a false tradition about his parentage and was not derived from that family. Gonzalo went to study at the University of Paris. In 1260 he became the rector of the University of Padua. After a sojourn in Rome, he returned to Castile to become a first a canon of the Cathedral of Burgos and then the dean of the chapter at the Cathedral of Toledo. In 1272, Gonzalo was elected Bishop of Cuenca. During this period he served the king at times as a royal notary. In 1274 he received a gift from the king, and the charter was written up by Ferrand Martínez.Joaquín González Muela (ed.), Libro del caballero Zifar (Madrid: Editorial Castralia, 1982), 11–14. On 27 September 1275 he was translated to the see of Burgos (vacant since 1269), and in May 1280 to the archdiocese of Toledo, the most important bishopric in Castile. In 1285 he was recognised as the primate of Spain (primas Hispaniae). Under Sancho IV, Gonzalo was \\"great chancellor in all our realms\\" (chanceller mayor en todos nuestros regnos) and Ferrand Martínez his scribe, but with the king's death in 1295 the archbishop's influence decreased. In the cortes held at Valladolid in the summer of that year, it was declared that ecclesiastical control of the chancery should cease. Chancery notaries should be laymen (legos). Gonzalo was one of those who opposed the assumption of the tutorship of the young king, Ferdinand IV, by his uncle, Henry the Senator, regarding the latter as \\"a great disturber\\" (un gran bolliciador). In the consistory of 4 December 1298 Pope Boniface VIII appointed him to the cardinal-bishopric of Albano. He died not long after in Rome, where he was buried in a \\"very nobly worked\\" (muy noblemente obrada) sarcophagus in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, “near the chapel of presepe domini, where Saint Jerome lies buried.”A quotation from the Libro del caballero Zifar: “çerca de la capilla de presepe domini, do yaze enterrado sant Gerónimo.” In the year 1300, in keeping with a promise he had made to the cardinal some years earlier, Ferrand Martínez went to Rome to fetch his body for burial in the cathedral of Toledo, in the front of the chapel of Santa María la Blanca. The return trip with the cardinal's body was extremely leisurely, making its way through Logroño to Burgos, where the corpse was received by King Ferdinand IV and his court, including Henry the Senator, Diego López V de Haro and Bishop Pedro Rodríguez of Burgos. This was probably between March and May 1301. At Peñafiel outside of Toledo it was received by Gonzalo's nephew, Gonzalo Díaz Palomeque, the new archbishop and by the local lord, Juan Manuel. It was reportedly greeted in the streets of Toledo by a delighted crowd of Christians, Jews and Muslims. The story of Gonzalo's relics is told in the prologue of the near-contemporary chivalric novel Libro del caballero Zifar, possibly written by Ferrand Martínez.González Muela, Libro, 52–53. He notes that \\"the rescue of Gonzalo's body was a true chivalrous request\\" (una verdadera demanda caballeresca), and was probably included for this reason, although the prologue was not printed with the rest of the work in 1512 in Seville.

Symptoms and signs Clinical symptoms of apoplexy associated with the basic mechanism of this disease: This image depicts a set of ovaries, one of which is normally functioning (left), and healthy, whilst the other one is suffering apoplexy, or the hemorrhaging of an organ. The ovary on the right's surface has been breached, and is bleeding. It has been cut off from the body's supply of nutrients and necrosis has set in. Apoplexy can also happen in the brain and the stomach. # Pain, which occurs primarily mid-cycle or after a minor delay in menstruation (at the time of the rupture of a corpus luteum cyst, for example). Pain is most often localized in the lower abdomen. Sometimes the pain may radiate to the rectum or to the lumbar or the umbilical region. # Bleeding into the abdominal cavity, which may be accompanied by: :* low blood pressure :* increase in heart rate :* weakness and dizziness :* syncope :* chills :* fever up to 38°C :* vomiting :* dry mouth Sometimes there may be inter-menstrual bleeding or spotting after menstruation. Quite often, ovarian apoplexy occurs after intercourse or training in the gym, when pressure in the abdomen has increased or ovarian tissue has experienced some stress. However, rupture of ovarian tissue can occur in conjunction with other diseases. Pathogenesis In the ovaries of sexually mature women, follicles grow, and oocyte matures in them, to prepare for potential fertilization. As a menstrual cycle progresses, a dominant follicle begins to stand out, and in the middle of the menstrual cycle it reaches its maximum size of about 20mm. Then the follicle ruptures, releasing a mature egg (ovulation). The location from which the follicle emerges then forms a temporary cyst, called the corpus luteum, which produces hormones to continue the menstrual cycle and mature the uterine lining. This is the normal ovarian cycle. In cases of dystrophic and sclerotic changes in ovarian tissue, acute and chronic inflammatory processes in the uterus, or in polycystic ovary syndrome and some other diseases, as well as the result of medication that stimulate ovulation, certain irregularities in ovulation process and corpus luteum formation occur. As a result, blood vessels in the ovary contract, become dilated, and increase intra-ovarian bleeding. As a result, a hemorrhage can occur in the corpus luteum due to the fragility of blood vessels, causing a hematoma. All this is accompanied by pain, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, pale skin, and/or fainting. If left untreated, internal bleeding may increase, creating a real threat to the health and life of the woman. Other possible causes of ovarian rupture include abdominal trauma, excessive physical stress, vigorous sexual intercourse, horseback riding, etc. Diagnosis Typical complaints appear during the middle or second half of the menstrual cycle. On examination, there is marked soreness of the affected ovary, and positive symptoms of irritation of the peritoneum. In a general blood test, a marked decrease in hemoglobin levels can be seen (in the anemic and mixed forms of ovarian apoplexy). Pelvic ultrasound reveals in the affected ovary a large corpus luteum cyst with signs of hemorrhage in it and/or free fluid (blood) in the abdominal cavity. Because ovarian apoplexy is an acute surgical pathology, diagnosis must be confirmed rapidly, since delays between the event and surgical intervention increases the magnitude of blood loss and may be life-threatening. Classification # Painful type – the primary symptom is pain, without signs of intraperitoneal bleeding. # Anemic type – the primary symptom is internal (abdominal) bleeding, without pain. # Mixed type – a combination of pain and intraperitoneal bleeding. However, according to recent data, this classification is inadequate, because the ovary cannot rupture without bleeding. Therefore, a new pathology has been devised in which the condition is divided according to severity: mild, moderate and severe (depending on the magnitude of blood loss). Treatment Treatment depends on the type of ovary apoplexy and the severity of intra-abdominal bleeding, but the condition must be treated in a hospital. In the case of pain without signs of intra-abdominal bleeding, conservative therapy may be initiated, which includes bed rest, antispasmodics, and physiotherapy. In the presence or suspected internal bleeding, surgery is indicated via laparoscopy or laparotomy. Other treatments may include efforts to stop the bleeding or resection of the affected portion of the ovary. However, in cases in which there is extensive damage to the ovary, it may be necessary to remove it.After being discharged from the hospital, it is important to take steps to prevent a recurrence in the future. Such steps include avoiding risk factors or beginning a regimen of oral contraceptives to control ovarian activity.

They are classified in two types of small and medium enterprises: family businesses and non-family businesses. The Mexican Government has supported PyMEs since 2004. The Mexican Chamber of Economy with the help of the Mexican government creates different types of programs for PyMEs that need to improve their participation in the national market and also for the international market. The PyMEs' size is classified by the number of employees they have. The main sectors are manufacturing, commerce and service.  PyMEs in Mexico  As of 2006 there were about 4 million enterprises in Mexico. Out of those 4 million, 99.8% were small and medium enterprises. About 52% of the Mexican GDP is generated by small and medium size enterprises, while the remaining 48% relies on large enterprises. Small and medium size enterprises make up 72% of the formal employment in Mexico. PyMEs are subdivided into: 15% for Micro, 14.5% for small and 22.5% for medium enterprises. PyMes can be classified by type and size. There is a manufacturing, commerce, and service type. Within these, PyMEs are classified according to the number of employees—10, 50, 250 and more than 250 respectively—into micro, small, medium, and large enterprises. Service enterprises are classed by those with have 10, 50, 100, and more than 100 employees. PyMEs throughout the nation are distributed by region. About 38% of them in the central part of the country, 17% are located southwest, 6% are southeast, 12% are northeast and 27% are center-west. There are two types of PyMEs in Mexico (according to their origin). Those that began as family businesses and those formed by formal partnership. The ones that start as family business are small and only very few of them have some type of projection abroad. These are usually the ones who search for government support mainly for financial and training purposes. The other type of small and Medium size enterprises in Mexico are those who follow an established path. An example of this could be franchises; these do not have a problem expanding abroad. Franchises are small projection of big enterprises who have already done market research before entering a new zone. They have all the possible experience on expanding overseas and very little risk on failing because in most cases they go under the concept of a high brand awareness. PyMEs have been an important part of the country's development, especially in the area of exports. Due to their small size they are versatile, dynamic and have growth potential. This potential also includes entering international markets. They are a major source of job creation in the country and are the most likely to implement new technologies. Since many are located in different regions of the country, they foment local development. The main contribution to enterprise growth lies with PyMEs. The importance of small and medium size enterprises in Mexico has grown through time due to the positive effect these businesses have had on Mexico's economy. Since these enterprises continue to become more important, the government is focusing a lot on supporting them. On the other hand, they also have some disadvantages. In general PyMEs have not developed the habit of reinvesting to improve production or reinvest in equipment. They do not have enough economic resources to hire specialized employees nor to train current ones. This and lack of foresight can lead to insufficient sales, lack of competitiveness, inadequate customer service, low quality and higher prices. Because of the lack of quality control, legal problems such as dealing with VATs and defective products becomes an issue.  Programs for PyME developments  Since 2004, Mexican government has had a number of programs to support PyMEs so that they help Mexico's economic growth. The government has two groups of programs to support PyMEs. The first group helps PyMEs to grow within the national market. The main programs are Emerging Programs, Productive Projects, Centros Mexico Emprende (Mexico undertake program), National System of Loan Guaranties, and Enterprises Consultancy. The main objective of the Programas Emergentes (Emerging Programs) is to help the economic areas that have been affected by natural disasters. This program achieves this objective through loans with special payment conditions. This help is given to the PyMEs that have lost revenue and the ability to generate revenue because of a natural disaster. The Emerging Programs are coordinated and supervised by \\"Fondo PyMe.\\" The regulations that this organization point out is that the PyMEs are supported with special resources with the concepts that the directive council determine that are essential to the economic reactivation of the enterprises. These enterprises have to satisfy certain conditions. Proyectos Productivos (Productive Projects) helps to finance investment projects that improve the competitiveness of PyMes. This helps to trigger the creation and maintenance of jobs and regional development. The most important project is the financing. These funds are mostly targeted to production projects. The projects have to help by developing, expanding and consolidating the enterprise. The Centros Mexico Emprende (Mexico undertake program) is for the execution of public or private services to support PyMEs. The support is given in a comprehensive, accessible, lively, and timely way according to the size and the enterprises potential. The different types of center concepts are: fitting out and infrastructure, designing and updating information systems for planning, and measuring of results generated from the \\"Centros Mexico Emprende.\\" Sistema Nacional de Garantias (National System of Loan Guaranties) provides PyMEs with easy access to the financing programs with competitive conditions and payment periods. The Consultoria Empresarial (Enterprises Consultancy) is a program that helps PyMEs be more productive and profitable. It achieves this objective through the identification of business intervention programs. These programs are applied to one or more fundamental areas of an enterprise as training and consultancy and the development of instructors and consultants.  Programs for existing PyMEs and international expansion  The second group helps PyMEs to maintain a place and to succeed in the international market. The SPyME (Subsecretaría para la Pequeña y Mediana Empresa) was created to promote, encourage, and design tools and programs with the purpose of creating, consolidating and developing micro, small, and medium enterprises in the international market. The Sub-secretary for Small and Medium Enterprise (SPYME), with the purpose of helping primarily small enterprises, created the Programa Nacional de Capacitación y Consultoría (National Program for Training and Consultancy). This program incorporates improvement actions in areas where weaknesses or opportunities are detected. The program stimulates the consolidation of the entrepreneurship through actions like the instrumentation of innovative methodologies in productive priority sectors. The program also foments the application of strategic programs to improve enterprises management.  National Program of Training and Consultancy (Programa Nacional de Capacitación y Consulta)  The Programa de Consultoría General (Program of General Consultancy), that was created for the projects of major demand identified by chambers and managerial associations, that as well as for state and municipal governments, will look for the support of the Fondo PyME (Fund SME). This program was made to take care of the needs of training and consultancy, across proven methodologies that assure they will have quantifiable results. The Programa Moderniza (Modernization Program), the Secretary of Economy (SE) and the Secretary of Tourism (SECTUR) started a System of Management named \\"Modernize\\" that allows to improve the quality of the services offered to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises of the tourist sector. The Secretary of Tourism carries out the consultants' formation, which are the only ones authorized to execute the program and to register in SECTUR. The Formación de Consultores PyME – JICA (SME Consultants' Formation – JICA) establishes the formation of advisers specialized in the methodology of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The process is based on the application of Japanese tools of improvements of high impact with a lower cost. It lasts approximately 1.5 months and is directed to consultants with more than three years of experience in managerial consultancy. This has allowed relying on a base of specialized consultants that multiplies the efforts to offer specialized services of consultancy that generate more competitive enterprises. The Consultoría Empresarial PyME (SME Managerial Consultancy-JICA) stimulates the development and consolidation of the MIPyMES by the application of a model of integral attention of standardized consultancy, carried out by the consultants PYME-JICA and accredited by the Secretary of Economy. The process of consultancy that is offered in the facilities of the company lasts from 3 to 4 months, and is directed for MIPYMES, preferably with two years of operation. The Fondo PyME (Fund SME), along with the National Program of Consultancy PYME-JICA, helps with subsidies that go from 30 to 70 percent of the total cost of the service of managerial consultancy.  PyMEs Exports  It is proven that many economies are based on their exports. Well organized and structured PyMEs can be a significant source of exports. For this reason, the Mexican government gives special attention to PyMEs in this regard, allocating a big part of its economic resources to help small and medium size enterprises expand overseas. Supported PyMEs can mean increasing exports and a more open economy. The \\"Subsecretaria para la pequena y mediana empresa\\" (SPyME) was founded to design, foment and promote programs and other tools that have as objective the creation, consolidation and development of micro, small and medium size enterprises. About 59% of Mexico's exports are controlled by 30% of the total enterprises in the country. Out of all the PyMEs existing only 9% of them export, while the remaining 83% do not have any type of presence overseas. International Commerce in Mexico is mainly based on large enterprises; this is why government is very interested on giving assistance and financial help to small businesses. Out of all the exporting enterprises in Mexico only 64,000 are PyMEs. They are located mostly in the center part of the country, northeast and center-west. There are many ways PyMEs can be supported in Mexico: * Fiscal support to Mexican exporters, * VAT return or VAT compensation, * Programs of foment for the manufacturing industry, * Export services (IMMEX), * Programs for sectorial promotion, * The Drawback Program (through which Government offers VAT returns to Mexican small businesses that export to a country that has imposed tariffs on imports), * Government benefits to high level exporting enterprises (ALTEX), * Government benefits to International commerce enterprises (ECEX), * Mechanisms of Indirect Exports such as VAT elimination or Application of 0% VAT on exports, * Mixed Commission for the Promotion of exports (COMPEX), * An annual incentive named National Exporting Price, * Government aid, such as information or opportunities to expand overseas, consultancy and training, * Commercial opportunities such as market analysis, * Selection and establishment of contact with client within the foreign market, and * Government support for PyMEs though a positioning process. The most important programs supporting for exports are Financing, Consultancy, Training, Exporting, Technical Assistance and Information on exports. The services that the Programa Nacional de Franquicias (Exemption National Program) offers to PyMES are: commercialization, consultancy and financing. Likewise, they approach entrepreneurs, MIPyMES and owners of exemptions, to give them support that offer the opportunity to start a new business taking advantage of the experience of an exemption, stimulate successful business to turn them into exemptions, and develop new exemptions. The program also supports the consolidation of existing exemptions, export models of Mexican exemptions, and strengthens the positioning of the brand of the existing exemptions and helps to realize the re-engineering of existing models of exemptions. The PyMExporta Centers are federal, state and local organizations who have the objective of helping the PyMEs that have the special interest to start, increase, or to diversify their exports worldwide. This organizations join efforts with the Business Mexican Sector to achieve this aim. Some of the advantages and benefits that the centers bring to PyMEs are the training of the export process, a specialized consultancy for the development of export projects, the possibility of being able of promote the PyMEs in the international market, consultancy in customs Mexico requirements, information about markets and legal regulations for exports and the support in the tasks of logistics and management. The PyMExporta Centers work with their own register methodology, accompaniment and management of institutional supports according with what the businesses require. The supporting service is personal and specialized for each need of the enterprises. Services are given depending on the levels of the identification of the enterprises potential, in case the enterprises have the facilities to export its product a document will be signed for the development of each process stage of the export. The commerce strategy identifies the requirements of the product, it supports and advises the businessman since the beginning of the contract of international sale until the end of the sale.

The battalion was first raised in 1915 and served at Gallipoli and the Western Front, primarily as pioneers. \\"By the end of the war, 2227 Maori and 458 Pacific Islanders had served in what became known as the Maori Pioneer Battalion. Of these, 336 died on active service and 734 were wounded. Other Maori enlisted (and died) in other battalions as well.\\" Origins=Recruitment When the First World War broke out, Māori leaders responded in various ways. Some, such as Rua Kenana Hepetipa, maintained total opposition to Māori enlistment. Others such as Āpirana Ngata, Paraire Tomoana, and Maui Pomare, were in favour of Māori enlistment and organised recruitment drives, particularly in the Waikato region of Ngāti Maniapoto and the East Coast Ngāti Porou region. Their recruitment campaign was particularly successful in Ngāti Porou, which enlisted enough men to form its own company in the battalion. Some companies were also supplemented by recruits from the Cook Islands and Niue. By 1916 the battalion was in desperate need of reinforcements. As part of the drive to recruit more soldiers, the song Te Ope Tuatahi was composed by Āpirana Ngata. It became famous during the First World War and was adopted as the anthem of the battalion. In 1917, again in need of reinforcements, Paraire Tomoana composed an additional verse to the song, specifically encouraging enlistment in Ngāti Kahungunu, and other eastern regions of the North Island. New Zealand Pioneer Battalion soldiers at the funeral of Lieutenant-Colonel King at Ypres, October 1917 The Pioneer Battalion performing a haka for Joseph Ward at Bois-de- Warnimont, 30 June 1918 After their initial enlistment, recruits were organised into their respective companies and undertook basic training at Narrow Neck camp in Auckland. Active service=Gallipoli campaign The battalion first departed New Zealand in February 1915 aboard the SS Warrimoo, arriving in March for further training in Egypt. Despite requests made to Major-General Alexander Godley by New Zealand Minister of Defence James Allen and Māori MPs Āpirana Ngata and Maui Pomare, the battalion was not deployed to Gallipoli with the first invasion force in April 1915. Instead it was kept in reserve and placed on garrison duty on the island of Malta, where further training was undertaken. However, increasing casualties among the Anzac forces at Gallipoli led to the deployment of the 461-man battalion. The battalion arrived at Anzac Cove on 3 July 1915. Here they joined the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and were deployed as infantry soldiers. In 1917, the battalion was renamed the New Zealand Maori (Pioneer) Battalion. After Gallipoli there was considerable criticism of three officers of the Māori Pioneers, who were charged with desertion in the face of the enemy, despite strong evidence to the contrary. Godley sent them home and broke up the Māori force when it was sent to France.New Zealand History on line. Maori Pioneer Battalion. In France the Māori troops were interspersed with troops from the Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment who were adapted into the pioneer role after suffering many casualties at Gallipoli. Service on the Western Front Men of the battalion constructing a road, 1917–18 It was intended that the battalion would be broken up and serve as reinforcement for other New Zealand units on the Western Front. However, after a short time the unit was reunited and served the rest of the war as pioneers digging trenches and drains, doing farm work, laying railway lines, erecting wire entanglements, burying artillery cables and building a cinema called \\"Kapai Theatre\\".The last Maopo. p 59. p 71. p 87. p 109 T. Simpson. Oratia Media. 2014. Much of the time the soldiers were engaged in making support or communication trenches well behind the front lines. When they had to work closer to the front they usually worked at night. During the winter months of 1916 the pioneers were well behind the front lines in comfortable billets where they were able to use local cafes and hotels, and socialise with French civilians. Often during these times they were able to play rugby against other military teams. In letters home they praised the French beer which was very cheap, and the good quality champagne.The Last Maopo. p 47. p 71. p 111. T. Simpson. Oratia Media 2014. They had time to observe French farmers and those soldiers with a farming background made critical comments about the backward French methods.T. Simpson. p 77. Although leave was rare most soldiers had a chance to visit England and Scotland to take in the sights. They had the opportunity to visit tourist attractions in London.T. Simpson pp. 86–87. The war diaries of the battalion say casualties were well below the rate for the New Zealand Division,T. Simpson p 108. but this was due to their service being primarily behind the lines. On at least one occasion the battalion was used to launch stealthy attacks on German trenches, armed with bayonets and patu. In late August 1916 the battalion was engaged at the Somme, and began work on creating the communication trench which became known as Turk Lane. It was more than 7 mi long, 5 ft 6in deep, 5 ft 6in wide at the top and 3 ft wide at the bottom, and a contemporary report said the Māori \\"made themselves famous by the digging of the Turk-line\\". At Messines Ridge, the battalion suffered 155 casualties, including 17 deaths. In December 1916, 43 Māori soldiers from the Māori Pioneer Battalion joined the New Zealand Tunnelling Company in the lead-up to the Battle of Arras. In 1917 the remnants of the Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment, which made up 50 per cent of the battalion's remaining strength, was replaced by newly arrived Māori reinforcements. Around the same time a contingent of 150 Niue Islanders was sent home after failing to adapt to the conditions in Western Europe.The Last Maopo .T. Simpson. The last reinforcements was predominantly composed of Cook Islanders, and most were sent to join the Rarotongan company in the Palestine campaign. At the conclusion of the war the battalion was involved in an unpleasant incident when a group of Māori soldiers, possibly suffering from battle fatigue, started shooting in a rest camp. When an officer was sent to investigate he was shot. Post-War After the war, the Pioneer Battalion was the only unit of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force to return home as a formed body. It arrived at Auckland aboard Westmoreland, disembarking on 6 April 1919 to band music and a welcome by Prime Minister James Allen, before marching to the Auckland Domain. In front of various tribal representatives, a pōwhiri (welcome ceremony) was performed. The various companies of the battalion then dispersed to their home regions and further pōwhiri at local marae. Over, 2,200 Māori served in the Pioneer Battalion during the course of the First World War, alongside nearly 460 Pacific Islanders. Over 730 personnel were wounded while 336 died while on active service.

The film was based on the 1941 novel of the same name by John Creasey, the sixth in the series featuring upper-class sleuth Richard Rollison, also known as \\"The Toff\\". This film and another Toff adaptation, Hammer the Toff, were shot back-to-back at Nettlefold Studios in the summer of 1951. They were released to cinemas in January and May 1952 respectively. Neither film was thought to have survived and both were classed as \\"missing, believed lost\\", although there was a degree of hope that they might be lurking as yet uncatalogued in British TV archives. Both films are included on the British Film Institute's \\"75 Most Wanted\\" list of missing British feature films. This changed in 2013 when Salute The Toff was finally released on DVD from Renown Pictures Limited. Plot The Honourable Richard Rollison (Bentley) is a well-known private detective who has friends and contacts in all echelons of society from the wealthy West End set to the lowest East End hovels. He likes to take on cases on behalf of underdogs, and is feared by the criminal underworld for his fearsome reputation of always getting his man. Young secretary Fay Gretton (Marsh) comes to Rollison, worried that her employer has not shown up for work for several days and cannot be contacted. Rollison breaks into the man's flat and finds a body - not that of Fay's missing boss, but the son of a millionaire businessman. The missing man is the prime suspect, and it is up to Rollison to get to the bottom of the case, aided by his East End contacts. After a series of dramatic events, including Fay being abducted and tied up, the truth is finally revealed, the missing man is found, and Rollison proves that he is innocent of any wrongdoing. Cast * John Bentley as Richard Rollison * Carol Marsh as Fay Gretton * Valentine Dyall as Inspector Grice * Shelagh Fraser as Myra Lorne * June Elvin as Lady Anthea * Arthur Hill as Ted Harrison * Michael Golden as Benny Kless * Roddy Hughes as Jolly * Wally Patch as Bert Ebbutt * Vi Stevens as Emily Ebbutt * Tony Britton as Draycott * John Forbes-Robertson as Gerald Harvey * Peter Bull as Lorne Reception Salute the Toff appears to have received a favourable reception from reviewers. Kine Weekly described it as \\"a sturdy, comprehensive yarn\\", while the Daily Film Renter called it \\"a deep and varied plot of robbery and murder, calculated to keep audience attention alert, a popular winner in the mystery and murder category\\". Today's Cinema enjoyed the film, but pointed out that sophisticated fare was not on the menu by classing it as a \\"bustling crime and detection action of the brand beloved by the masses\\".

The East Slavic Buzhan tribe inhabited the area of the Buzan river. The Buzhans are one of various Slavic tribes which formed the modern Russian people. The Volga Delta was subject to territorial disputes between the Nogai Horde and the Russian-annexed Astrakhan Khanate in the 1550s. Negotiations between Ismael Beg and Ivan IV established the Buzan as the boundary between the two realms but proceeded to push the horde back further out of the fertile delta region. The counter-clockwise extremity of the modern Kazakhstan–Russia border reflects this history, largely following the leftmost corridors of the delta.

It has rough, flaky bark at the base of its trunk, smooth cream yellow or grey bark above and sometimes throughout, the smooth bark shed in ribbons. The adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved and the flower buds are arranged in groups of seven. The flowers are white and the fruit is a cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or hemispherical capsule.flower budsfruitjuvenile leaves  Description  Eucalyptus bosistoana is the largest of the \\"box\\" group of eucalypts, grows to a height of up to with a stem diameter of at least and forms a lignotuber. The bark on the lower part of the trunk is thin, greyish brown, rough and flaky. The bark on the upper part of the trunk and on the branches is smooth, white, cream- coloured or grey and is shed in ribbons. Sometimes all the bark is smooth. Young plants and coppice regrowth have rounded stems and oblong to elliptic or egg-shaped, pale green leaves, long and wide with a petiole. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are usually arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from January to April and the flowers are white. The fruit are cup- shaped, barrel-shaped or hemispherical, long and wide on a pedicel long with the valves level with the rim or enclosed. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus bosistoana was first formally described in 1895 by Ferdinand von Mueller. The description was published in the Australasian Journal of Pharmacy. The specific epithet (bosistoana) honours Joseph Bosisto, who was one of the first in Australia to extract essential oils, especially eucalyptus oil. Distribution and habitat Coast grey box occurs in New South Wales and Victoria from as far north as the Wolgan Valley, west of Sydney and as far south as eastern Gippsland. It is found near streams in lowland areas on better quality soils, particularly over limestone, although it may also appear on the tablelands up to above sea level, near Goulburn and Bungonia. Eucalyptus bosistoana is seen growing with E. cypellocarpa, E. longifolia, E. paniculata, E. sideroxylon, Corymbia maculata, E. angophoroides, E. elata, E. muelleriana, E. globoidea and other trees such as Casuarina cunninghamiana.  Uses  A significant timber species, resistant to termites though susceptible to lyctus borers. The interlocked grain timber is highly regarded for heavy engineering. Other uses include construction, piles, poles and sleepers. A durable timber of considerable weight, being 1100 kilograms per cubic metre.

It is notable for its saw mill, hop fields and tourism. It has a sprawling street pattern which makes the small town spread across the valley floor. History The area was first settled by James Reid Scott who named it after a small village in his native Scotland. By 1870 there were only three buildings in the valley but three years later, with the discovery of tin, a shanty town had grown up. By 1877 the population was around 300. By 1883 the town had been proclaimed. Branxholm Post Office opened on 1 August 1876. Tin mining gradually declined to be replaced by timber cutting and in 1970 the first hop fields were planted. Since the official opening of the Blue Derby Mountain bike trails in neighbouring Derby in 2015 tourism as an industry is becoming more important to the economy of Branxholm. In the few years since the opening of the trails new businesses catering to tourists have opened, including cafes and tourist accommodation. Scott Street is the main road through Branxholm. The local IGA supermarket is in the background.  For visitors  For visitors Branxholm's main shopping area provides an IGA supermarket, Cafe and Art Gallery, Italian-style restaurant, wood-fired pizza restaurant and the Elegant Imperial Hotel (circa 1907) with accommodation from $45 night, meals, bar and takeaway alcohol. There are several tourism and short-stay accommodation options in the town. Community_Riverwalk_Branxholm.jpgBranxholm community riverwalk The Branxholm community riverwalk is a great way to enjoy the river for fishing, swimming and picnics. Close to the town Mount Horror, known for excellent scenic views, is surrounded by extensive pine and gum plantations. The Forestry Commission's fire tower is open to the public when attended in the summer.

Water was needed for hydraulic tin-mining and the legacy mining holes, water races and dams are worth exploring. For example, the disused Mount Paris Dam, located on C425 road which has become a photographic icon on Instagram and the Briseis Water Race walking track. The Briseis Race walking track is an easy walk that highlights the tin-mining history of Branxholm. This water race is an amazing feat of engineering. Commenced in 1901, it was hand-built by three gangs of approximately 100 men in each. It was constructed from either end of the 48 km length, simultaneously and section by section over a period of just 15 months. Water harnessed from behind Ringarooma was channelled along the race to Derby, to provide a minimum of 24 million gallons daily to the large scale hydraulic mining at the Briseis Tin Mine, with the first release of water taking three weeks to reach the mine! Today the visitor can ‘walk with history’ along the Great Briseis Water Race Walk at Branxholm, and take in the remains of four metre deep cuttings through solid rock, sections of original stonewalling, remains of timber trestle fluming structures, and many other insights into the character of those who undertook this mighty task.https://digitised- collections.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/24292/305768_UDS2013255-13-0005.pdf  Rail Trail  Construction of the Dorset Rail Trail was a local Scottsdale Rotary Club project. The trail follows the old railway corridor from Tonganah to Tulendeena and hopefully later to Legerwood. The trail is used by cyclists, walkers and horse-riders. Each year in August the Trail Run and Ride competitive event is held. The event distances range from 56 km to 2 km, from Scottsdale township to the top of Billycock Hill and return. Sport The town used to have a football team in the NEFU (North Eastern Football Union). Railway Old_Railway_Station_in_Branxholm,_Tasmania.jpgThe old Branxholm railway station (now a hay barn) sits in a paddock on the outskirts of the town. Branxholm was served by a branch railway line which extended from Launceston to Herrick, 4 km short of Moorina. The State rail connected Branxholm to its system in 1911. By 1978, the last passenger trains closed down in Tasmania and the rail network, including the Launceston-Scottsdale line, focused on carrying freight. By the early 1980s there were just three daily services between Scottsdale and Launceston transporting logs, woodchips and other goods however, by 2005, the line was closed.

The first bridge was built by the Rhenish Railway Company and put into operation at the end of 1873. It was replaced by a new bridge in 1927, which was badly damaged during the Second World War, but rebuilt and is still serves rail traffic between the Ruhr region and Aachen. History  On 23 August 1866, the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, RhE) opened its line between Osterrath and Essen to connect the coal mines in the Ruhr region with its railway network, which at that time was mainly located on the west bank of the Rhine. This line included the Rheinhausen–Hochfeld train ferry. Prior to the Austro-Prussian War, the Prussian military opposed the building of fixed bridges across the Rhine for military reasons, except in fortified cities such as Cologne, Mainz, Koblenz and Düsseldorf. Hints in 1869 that military opinion had changed led the company to apply immediately for permission to construct a bridge from Rheinhausen to Duisburg. The first bridge  The Prussian government issued a concession on 29 July 1871 for the construction of a railway bridge on the Osterrath–Essen line near Rheinhausen on the following conditions: *Chambers with mines were to be built in all bridge piers, *Towers were to be constructed with defensive facilities at both bridgeheads and there were to be swing bridges at the end of the main bridge that could be activated during wartime, *Train ferry facilities on the banks were to be removed, *300 thalers was to be paid to the Prussian government for two military gunboats. Since the Rhenish Railway Company plans for the bridge was largely ready, construction of the double-track bridge was able to begin in 1872. Despite two floods, it was completed in two years. To the west of the Rhine, a 16 span brick approach bridge was built over the flood plain; each span had an internal length of 50 Prussian feet. The central pier of the swing bridge was about 34 metres long and 10 metres wide. In the event of an attack it could be turned 90° and thus made impassable for troops and trains. At the ends of the bridge there were defensive towers, which had pedestrian walkways on each side. The main bridge consisted of four spans, each 98 metres long, which were supported by three piers. Each span consisted of a two-hinged arch truss made of 2,800 tons of wrought iron made by Jacobi, Haniel and Huyssen (later GHH) in Oberhausen. On the eastern side of the Rhine the bridge's defensive tower connected with a swing bridge and a shorter bridge over the flood plain with 6 spans, which were 50 Prussian feet long. The bridge had an overall length of 800 metres. Freight operations on the bridge commenced on 24 December 1873. The passenger trains still used the train ferry until 14 January 1874. All four lines of the ferry could then be demolished. The construction costs for the Rhenish Railway were about 2.5 million thalers. The ever-increasing rail traffic across the bridge and the increasingly heavy trains were already starting to damage to the bridge by 1910 and at the beginning of 1914 the first plans for a new bridge were being drafted, but were dropped because of the First World War. Western section of the bridge with old bridge head =Bombing = On 30 June 1923, during the occupation of the Ruhr a time bomb exploded while a Belgian military train was crossing the bridge. Eight people died and several were injured. The second bridge  The construction of the second bridge began in 1925 and it was commissioned on 13 October 1927. It was built only a few metres downstream of the first bridge. This was demolished as far as the left-bank bridge pylon in order to remove impediments to shipping and the discharge of floods. The new bridge had a clearance for navigation that was nearly 180 metres wide. The main bridge was 20 metres high with spans of 126 metres and 189 metres. It was continued on both sides by spans that were both 104 metres long and 10 metres high and on the eastern approach there was a bridge with a 51.8 metre-long span over local industrial rail tracks. To the west of the Rhine there was a brick viaduct with 19 spans, each 15.60 metres long, over the flood plain. A pedestrian bridge was attached on its northern side. The steel superstructure for the 907 metre-long rail bridge was built by two local construction companies, Friedrich-Alfred-Hütte (part of the Krupp group) of Rheinhausen and Harkort of Duisburg. The eastern end of the bridge was made impassable by a bomb on 22 May 1944 during World War II. The adjacent Krupp factory built a temporary bridge and temporary piers within 17 days and the bridge was extensively repaired. However the following year German troops blew up the entire bridge on 4 March 1945, as they retreated from the western bank of the Rhine. They also completely destroyed the pier in the centre of the river. The third bridge  Victory Bridge at Duisburg - Rheinhausen, built in six days, fifteen hours and twenty minutes - then a record - at long over the Rhine River. Immediately after the American army crossed the Rhine, the 332nd Engineer General Service Regiment (as a member of ADSEC Engineer Group \\"A\\") constructed a replacement railway bridge long over the river in the record time of six days, fifteen hours and twenty minutes. The bridge was completed 8 May 1945 and was named the \\"Victory Bridge\\" in English. This line was put back into operation on 12 May 1945. The ramps were built over the local marshalling yards of Krupp and German railways, partly assembled from the abundant debris that had accumulated on both sides as a result of the war. Old left bank bridge piers at the southwest of the Duisburg-Hochfeld bridge The fourth bridge  In August 1945 work began on the recovery of the remains of the destroyed bridge superstructure. Still usable parts were recovered and reused. Almost half of the old structure was incorporated into the new bridge in its original form. The fourth bridge was put into operation on 1 October 1949 and it remains in operation. In addition to freight trains, the bridge is used by Regionalbahn services RB 31, Der Niederrheiner, and RB 33, Rhein-Niers-Bahn, and Regional-Express service RE 2, Rhein-Haard-Express. On the northern side of the bridge is a wide footpath, which is also used by cyclists.

It stars Tyler Perry as Mabel \\"Madea\\" Simmons, Cassi Davis as Aunt Bam, Palmer Williams, Jr. as Uncle Monroe, and Chandra Currelley-Young as Shirley. Perry began writing \\"Big Happy Family\\" after the death of his mother in December 2009. The main character of Shirley is based on her. Plot Shirley (Chandra Currelley), accompanied by Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis), visits Dr. Frank Wallace (Omarr Dixon). Dr. Wallace tells Shirley that her cancer is active and she might have 4–6 weeks left. Later, Aunt Bam tells Shirley that she invited Madea to come over and help her when she tells her children the news. The scene later switches to the house where Joyce (Cheryl Pepsii Riley) shows up and informs Shirley that she called everybody, later Aunt Bam complains about the fact that she still doesn't have a man. Soon enough, Madea (Tyler Perry) arrives, ready to help Shirley. When Tammy (Crissy Collins) shows up, Madea informs her that she's very angry with her and her husband Harold (Danny Clay): she gave them $275 to fix her car and it didn't start. Byron (Jefferey Lewis) and his girlfriend Rose (Chontelle Moore) arrive, and Aunt Bam tells Rose she wants her $20, which Rose borrowed about a year ago. Rose says it's petty to ask for such a small amount of money back, then reveals that she dropped $900 on eyeshadow and shoes. Madea convinces Aunt Bam to chase after Rose. Kimberly (Támar Davis) arrives demanding to know why her sisters summoned her to the house, but they don't know themselves. When Donnie (Zuri Craig) comes, he tries to kiss Aunt Bam and Madea, who warns him that she got H1N1 from his last kiss. When Madea quizzes him, he says he's 17 and in the 6th grade, to which she responds that at least he's in school and his children will know he's right down the hall from their classrooms. Harold arrives and Madea repeats what she told Tammy, and now that they're both here she tells them both that if her car isn't fixed when she's ready to leave, they'll have to run like hell. Kimberly's husband, Jason (Rico Ball) rushes in to announce that Uncle Monroe (Palmer Williams, Jr.) has arrived; everyone hides their stuff because he's a crack cocaine-addicted kleptomaniac. Uncle Monroe has barely stepped inside when he thinks he smells drugs in the kitchen, which makes him hurry. Karen (Brandi Milton) stalks in demanding to see Byron, which sparks Rose's jealousy. Karen threatens Byron that if he doesn't pay her some child support, 'the popo's gon' be knockin' at yo' do'!', backed up by Aunt Bam. Madea orders Karen to leave, they're having a family moment. Byron, Karen (and her baby), and Rose leave, Kimberly demands to know why she was called, and Jason chides her for her attitude, which angers her more and she storms out. When Harold points out how Kimberly's behavior is similar to Tammy's, Tammy tells him to shut up and he turns away in shame. Uncle Monroe calls a Man Meeting in the kitchen. He talks Harold into standing up for himself, but when Tammy comes in, he pretends the men are having a Bible study. Madea notices Byron sagging and tells him to pull up his pants. Shirley looks upset and Donnie and Byron sing her a gospel song. Meanwhile, Donnie finds out from Aunt Bam that Kimberly is his real mother. Madea leaves the house and tries to start her car, but unfortunately for Tammy and Harold, her car wouldn't start. So she gets her gun and starts chasing after Harold and Tammy. The next day, Shirley's cancer starts taking effect and she assures Joyce that she is all right and that she knows she's close to Heaven. Joyce thanks her for giving her the life they both wanted by Shirley giving her Jesus (You Gave Me Jesus) since Aunt Bam spills that Shirley is sick. That night, Joyce gets a new makeover for the date with Frank that Aunt Bam set up. Then Frank tells her that her mother is in the hospital. Then Shirley tells all her children that she wants them to do the right thing, although she will be gone forever. Shirley dies, and her spirit goes up to Heaven (\\"Heaven Waits for Me\\") and this makes everyone sad (as they strongly cry for her loss) and scared of what will happen in their futures without her (calling out to the Lord). When everyone comes home from the funeral, they gather in the living room. Madea gives everyone advice on what they should do. Karen stops by to express her condolences to Byron, but soon they began to argue. Frustrated, Madea tells Karen to stop worrying about Byron and Rose, stop using her baby to make Byron's life miserable, and keep moving forward. Rose tells Byron it's time to go, but Madea snatches Byron's shirt, re-seating him. When Rose tells Madea she should let her \\"man\\" grow up and be a man, Madea uses Uncle Monroe's \\"Yah, trick!\\"-choke-move on her. She follows up by lecturing them that the elderly should be treated with respect and dignity, after all, they marched for their freedom. She finally lets them leave and moves on to Harold and Tammy: Tammy shouldn't talk to Harold so harshly, but Harold needs to toughen up. Then she talks to Joyce about how God works through people's prayers. Lastly, Madea reveals that Kimberly was raped by an uncle on her father's side at 12 years old. She then tells her that she has love and needs get past the pain and show it more. Kimberly goes upstairs with Jason and sincerely apologizes for all she's done (\\"You Are My Man\\"). Madea goes \\"off-script\\" to talk about things that are happening in \\"the world today.\\" Later, Madea gathers everyone and they all join in singing old songs. Finally, upstairs, Harold asks Tammy to sit down and when she doesn't comply, he yells at her. Harold then resolves the issue between their relationship with a song (\\"If Only For One Night\\").

It originally aired on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on November 3, 2010. The episode was written by Dan O'Shannon and directed by season two's main director, Michael Spiller. In the episode, Claire and Haley are at home sick while Phil tries to find an annoying chirping smoke detector. Gloria and Manny go to Jay's work place much to Jay's dismay and Cameron takes Lily to a commercial shoot against Mitchell's wishes. \\"Chirp\\" received mostly positive reviews. According to the Nielsen Media Research, \\"Chirp\\" was seen by 12.21 million viewers and a 4.8 rating/7% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, a slight drop from the previous episode. Ariel Winter does not appear in the episode.\\"Modern Family\\" Chirp (TV episode 2010) - IMDb. Retrieved December 1, 2012. Plot Gloria (Sofía Vergara) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) go to pick up Jay (Ed O'Neill) from his workplace to take him to a restaurant for lunch. While there one of Jay's employees, Jack (Bryan Krasher), lets Manny handle a forklift which he drives into the wall. Because of the incident, Jay fires Jack, much to Manny's anger and dismay. Meanwhile, Jay tries to figure out what anniversary Gloria is celebrating today, because she celebrates everything, including their first fight. Jay thinks he has figured what they are celebrating, and therefore where he is to meet Gloria despite Manny's efforts to blackmail Jay into hiring Jack again. Manny learns that the reason that Jay will not hire Jack back is because he almost \\"hurt [his] kid.\\" Manny, touched by Jay calling him his kid, tells him the real location of the date. At the Dunphy house, Claire (Julie Bowen) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) get sick and have to stay home. The two initially bond, but soon Dylan (Reid Ewing) calls Haley, making Claire angry. After Dylan hangs up, Claire tries to convince Haley to break up with Dylan and start going out with David a much brighter kid that Claire prefers (albeit without mentioning either name), using one of the useless male characters on All My Children as an example. Unfortunately, Haley thinks Claire is talking about herself and Phil (Ty Burrell). With Claire sick, Phil takes care of her jobs while trying to find an annoying smoke detector that keeps beeping. Seeing this as a sign he is not man, Phil tries his best to find the smoke detector, to do all of Claire's jobs, and to get his clients back, failing at everything. Soon after replacing the batteries in all the new smoke detectors, Phil uses his old cheerleading baton to destroy a couple of the smoke detectors. He soon realizes that Luke (Nolan Gould) had left the old smoke detectors in the attic last year, and they were the ones that were chirping. In the meantime, Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) takes Lily to act in a commercial for a children's furniture store, against Mitchell's (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) decision. Adult actors perform voice over for Lily and another Asian child, using stereotypical dubbed-Japanese accents. Mitchell arrives at the studio and confronts Cameron, pointing out that the commercial is racist because it exploits Lily's Asianness and not her acting ability. Cameron initially denies the charge, but then the director brings in the SaveZilla (Godzilla) monster. Cameron asks the director (Darren Dupree Washington) to tone down the stereotypical accents, but the director refuses, saying that it is a satire. Cameron takes Lily away, but not before choosing the wrong Asian child first. Production The episode was written by Dan O'Shannon, marking his third writing credit for the series. The episode was directed by Michael Spiller, his sixth director's credit. The episode is the first of the season to feature Dylan (Reid Ewing), Haley's boyfriend. The episode is the first to mention the late-2000s recession. In an interview with Zap2it, Sarah Hyland said referring to Claire and Haley's storyline, \\"That's really cute. Me and Julie in bed all day.\\" Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Chirp\\" was viewed by an estimated 12.21 million households and received a Nielsen rating of 7.3 rating/12% share meaning that 7.3% of American households watched the episode and that 12% of all televisions in use at the time were watching it.

Rachael Maddux of New York gave the episode a rather negative review saying \\"this episode in particular seemed stuck in a rut.\\" Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode mostly a positive review saying it felt more \\"modern\\" than usual. The A.V. Club writer Donna Bowman said \\"even though these three molehill versions took a while to get cranked up, they provide satisfying and even elegant expressions of what the art of Modern Family is all about\\". Despite this she stated that the Cameron-Mitchell sub-plot didn't have the \\"ovely ascending—then crashing—arc of the others\\".

During the Franco-Prussian War, German troops had used the hill upon which the fort sits as a spotting and firing location, ideal for the siting of new rifled guns whose range was increased over old-fashioned smooth-bore guns. These weapons could attack Paris from Cormeilles, so a new outer ring of forts had to be built outside the first ring of forts built in 1840–1860 to deny the area to enemy gunners. The Séré de Rivières system was designed as a response to these technological innovations, and to the loss of French territories in Alsace and Lorraine. Description The trapezoidal fort controls the lower Seine valley and the railway line to Pontoise. The walled fort was surrounded by a ditch defended by two double caponiers and an aileron. Entry was over a laterally-rolling bridge. The Fort de Cormeilles was armed with 64 guns, served by 1132 men, 36 officers and 14 horses, and could operate independently for three months. The new fort cost 3.3 million francs d'or. However, as one of the first of the Séré de Rivières system forts, it was built in brick and stone, with an earthen shield. This construction could not withstand new high-explosive shells that were developed in the 1870s, rendering the fort effectively obsolete without concrete reinforcement. This fort was never upgraded. The fort features a chapel, complete with traceried windows, and a monumental three-story caserne. The façades feature an unusual amount of detail and ornamentation. Six detached batteries and one redoubt supported the fort from the rear: * Batteriedu Moulin de Risquetout * Batterie de la Borne de Marbre * Batterie de l'Étang * Batterie du Ront-Point * Batterie du Château-Rouget * Batterie des Cotillons * Redoute de Franconville Another battery, the Batterie du Belvedere was located towards the front on the fort's glacis, with the Batterie de la Petit Montagne on the opposite side. Chapel windows History A 1911 project proposed a 75mm gun turret and two machine gun turrets, as well as a protected 155mm gun battery, never realized. In 1914 the fort was equipped with 75mm anti-aircraft guns to counter Zeppelin raids against Paris. The anti-aircraft artillery was upgraded in the early 1930s with four new 75mm guns, replaced by German 20mm guns during German occupation. After 1940 the fort was used by the German occupiers as an ammunition depot for the German navy. Following World War II the fort was used to lodge members of the French Forces of the Interior (FFI), then as a prison until 1956. From 1956 the fort was used as lodging for prison workers at nearby facilities, such as the Prison de Fresnes. Housing was built on the surface of the fort, and the complex featured a nursery school. The last families, principally North Africans and the family of the fort's keeper, left the fort at the beginning of the 1970s. From 1965 to 1997 the fort was used as a commando training center. The Fort de Cormeilles is now the property of the Green Space Agency of the Île-de-France regional government. Preservation work is in the hands of the Association des Amis du Fort de Cormeilles, a volunteer group, which encourages the use of the facility by artists and by television and movie studios. Public visits are available every month and on special occasions.  Cinema  The Fort de Cormeilles is regularly used as a backdrop for films and television. Films that used the fort include L'Autre Dumas, The Blood of Others, Triple Cross and The Night of the Generals.

The film was based on the 1947 novel of the same name by John Creasey, the 17th in the series featuring upper-class sleuth Richard Rollinson, also known as \\"The Toff\\". This film and another Toff adaptation Salute the Toff were shot back-to-back at Nettlefold Studios in the summer of 1951 with identical production credits and many of the same actors. Hammer the Toff was issued to cinemas in March 1952 as the sequel to Salute the Toff. There would be no further entries in the series of films. Although it was once considered lost, appearing on the British Film Institute's \\"75 Most Wanted\\" list of missing British feature films, it was released on DVD in March 2016. It was produced by Ernest G. Roy. Plot On the train to the seaside resort of Brighthaven, Richard Rollinson (Bentley) is sharing a carriage with an attractive young lady called Susan Lancaster (Dainton). The journey is rudely interrupted when the window of the carriage is shattered by a barrage of bullets. Richard learns from the shaken Susan that she is on her way to join an uncle on holiday, and offers to escort her safely to her hotel. They learn that her uncle has disappeared, but has left Susan a package. Later, Rollinson happens to overhear a pair of shady characters discussing how to kidnap Susan. She explains that her uncle has developed a secret formula which sinister characters are keen to get their hands on, and they have been receiving threats of menace, hence the flight to Brighthaven. Rollinson consults his old colleague Inspector Grice of Scotland Yard, who tells him that the evidence is pointing in the direction of a particular man as being responsible for the abduction. Using his friends and contacts in the East End, Rollinson investigates, while Susan is being kidnapped and tied up. Rollinson finally succeeds in identifying the criminals and their leader \\"The Hammer\\", releasing Susan and proving that the man suspected by the police is innocent.

Dating from the mid 18th century, it is now a museum housing the Kastrupgård Collection (Kastrupgårdsamlingen) of modern art, which is owned and operated by Tårnby Municipality. History and architecture Kastrupgård was designed in rococo style by sculptor and architect Jacob Fortling (1711-1761) for his own use. It was built between 1749 to 1753. Fortling came to Denmark from Germany and became royal master builder and sculptor to the Danish Royal Court. He also founded the nearby Kastrup Pottery and Tile Works (Kastrup Værk). Collections Tårnby municipality decided in 1968 to convert Kastrupgård into a museum and establish an art collection. After the restoration of Kastrupgård, the collection opened as a museum in 1977. In 1983, the south side wing was moved into a new exhibition hall and in 1988 two halls in the main building were arranged for exhibitions and a café. In 2013, the municipality of Tårnby was in charge of extensive refurbishment and redevelopment, so that there is now a museum in all the four wings of the site. Support was provided by Realdania, a private association in Denmark which supports projects in architecture and planning. The museum contains a collection of modern art which has been acquired gradually by Tårnby Municipality since 1970. The emphasis is on graphic arts.

At , it has been called the shortest covered bridge in the United States. The bridge, one of 17 drivable covered bridges in the county, was designed by John Smolen, former Ashtabula County Engineer and the designer of the Smolen–Gulf Bridge, the longest covered bridge in the U.S., also in Ashtabula County. Construction Conceived in 2007, the bridge project proceeded in 2008 when the Ohio Public Works Commission supplied a grant for its construction. The crossing used to be over a concrete culvert. When the culvert needed repairs, it was decided to replace it with a covered bridge, because it would be cheaper (or at least comparable, at $400,000) and also would add to the tourism created by Ashtabula County's other covered bridges. The foundation for the bridge was laid in September 2010, with the bridge proper assembled starting the following month. About 60 students from the Ashtabula County Joint Vocational School (now Ashtabula County Technical and Career Campus, or A-Tech) in nearby Jefferson Township contributed their labor, further defraying the costs. The bridge opened to traffic on August 22, 2011. It was dedicated on October 8, 2011. It has footpaths on both sides that are protected from road traffic.

Founded by members of the Palestinian Diaspora in 2006, the movement has been led by Husam Bajis and continues to gain support by members of the Palestinian Central Council and the Palestinian National Council and strives to bridge the gap between Palestinian nationals and the United States and ensure that American support for an independent Palestinian state remains vital. History Yitzhak Rabin, Bill Clinton, and Arafat during the Oslo Accords on 13 September 1993. In 1993, The United States brought both the Palestinians and the Israelis to Washington. The late PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat, sat together with Shimon Peres, the late Israeli President, and in meetings with U.S. leaders they established the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Chairman Arafat was then democratically elected as first President of the PNA. Later, many countries (with the exception of a few) allowed the PNA to be the only representation of the Palestinian people. This continues to this day, with the PNA not being recognized as the voice of the Palestinian people.

It was introduced in the 1990s because laws prohibited young people from going to dance in bars and nightclubs that served alcoholic drinks. Throughout the 20th century up to the 1980s, the word matinée was used in Argentina for the first film exhibition of the day, usually around 2 p.m. and often intended for children. A matinée would usually feature a double feature of two films, with a live performance in between (usually a singer or comedy act) in the early decades of the century. A loanword to Spanish from French word matinée (in turn from the French matin: 'morning'), the word was used in France (although not in its literal sense) to contrast from soirée (from soir: 'evening') and from nuit ('night'). Features The usual age range is 14 to 18, although some clubs admit 13-year-olds. The official schedule established by the Government of Argentina is from 8 p.m. to midnight; in some provinces, the clubs must close by 11:30. The law prohibits smoking and alcoholic drinks. In practice, smoking is widespread. To circumvent the prohibition of alcohol, many young people drink at a friend's house or in a nearby park before heading to the matinee.

Mary was brought up in Poltalloch, Argyll, Scotland. Until the age of 16, she attended the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in South Kensington, London. She began her television career in 1948, having gained broadcasting experience on the radio during World War II. As more and more men were called up to fight, women became increasingly in demand to fill posts at the BBC. Mary Malcolm was taken on and worked for the Home Service as a continuity announcer from March 1942. With the relaunch of the BBC's television service after the war, she worked alongside Sylvia Peters and McDonald Hobley, with the trio averaging ten days' work a month each. At this time, all television programmes were introduced by an in-vision host or hostess and broadcasts were normally live. Malcolm received no training and became known for her spoonerisms: \\"By the end of the day I was tired, and when I came to the weather forecast I just read it out without really trying. My biggest fear was 'drain and rizzle', which I said more than once.\\" With the advent of commercial rival ITV in 1955, the BBC’s reliance on announcers diminished. Commercial breaks quickly became popular and the BBC decided audiences no longer needed a hostess to soothe them. Malcolm left the BBC in 1956 although she continued to appear as a guest on various programmes including an episode of the comedy series The Goodies.Ross, Robert The Complete Goodies, (London 2000), B T Batsford.

In May 2015 Elizabeth Finn Care came under the Turn2us brand.Turn2us Origins Elizabeth Finn Care was established as the Distressed Gentlefolk's Aid Association in 1897 by Elizabeth Finn, aged 72, and her daughter Constance, after learning that gentlefolk - a British class description for \\"people of the better sort\\" - were living destitute. One of these gentlefolk was an 80-year-old woman, dying of cancer while barely subsisting on the declining returns from her failing investments. The obituary of Colonel W. W. Knollys after his death in 1904 claimed he was one of three founders. An example of its mission is summarised by David Aaronovitch, saying that \\"if the Salvation Army took the most wretched off the streets, Elizabeth Finn’s Distressed Gentlefolk’s Aid Association identified, in the downwardly mobile, a genuine and discrete kind of misery.\\" Change of name In 1989 The New York Times reported that \\"Some supporters and detractors have argued that the Distressed Gentlefolk's Aid Association should change its name in order to appear less class-bound and more up to date.\\" By 2000 the charity had decided to change its name, as \\"gentlefolk\\" had become dated and the organisation decided to honour the memory of its founder by changing its name to the Elizabeth Finn Trust. Described as an opportunity to move with the times, the change was described as necessary by the charity's Chief Executive, Jonathan Welfare, because \\"we describe ourselves as an organisation that helps out with professionals rather than gentlefolk\\". The director of marketing and communications said that \\"by changing the name we hope to be more appealing to people who would otherwise be scared away by the words distressed and gentlefolk.\\" The charity later updated its name to Elizabeth Finn Care. Merger with Turn2us In 2014 the charity embarked on a project to look into the impact of coming under one brand. As a result of this consultation it was announced that Elizabeth Finn Care and Turn2us were to become Turn2us.http://www.turn2us.org.uk/About-Us/News/Elizabeth-Finn-Care-and- Turn2us-to-come-together On 18 May 2015 the charity formally came under the Turn2us name and a new logo and strap-line were produced to reflect the changes. As a result of this merger all charitable activity formerly undertaken by Elizabeth Finn Care now takes place under the Turn2us brand. Current work The charity defines its role as follows: In 2007, the charity supported 2,500 people each year, spending £4 million in weekly grants and one-off payments. The charity set up Turn2us as a separate service in 2007 and they rejoined in 2009. Turn2us allows people to identify welfare benefits, grants and other help available to them. Elizabeth Finn Care operates nine care homes and 10 almshouse cottages through its subsidiary Elizabeth Finn Homes. Elizabeth Finn Care also conducts research into issues of poverty and financial difficulty. In June 2010, they released a report stating that 2 out of 5 people expected to be financially worse off in six months time. Previous research showed that a third of people would skip meals to save money before approaching a debt charity. In April 2010, in research with Roehampton University, they found that the recession was having an effect on the mental health of UK residents due to concerns about job losses and pay cuts.

Journal of Marketing Communications. 21: 65–77. doi:10.1080/13527266.2014.970820. Many businesses utilize fliers, coupons, posters and art displays as a cost-effective alternative to the traditional marketing methods such as television, print and social media.Levinson, Jay (1998). Guerrilla Marketing. New York, New York: Houghton Mifflin Company. pp. 1–89. . Based on the shifting characteristics of modern-day consumers – such as increased product knowledge and expectations of transparency – the goal of street marketing is to utilize direct communication to enhance brand recognition.Ries, A. and J. Trout, 1986. Marketing Warfare. McGraw-Hill, New York. This style of marketing grew in popularity in 1986 when Jay Conrad Levinson published his book Guerrilla Marketing, which paved the future for unconventional and abnormal brand campaigns. Street marketing is often confused with ambient marketing, which is a marketing strategy of placing ads on unusual objects or in unusual places where you wouldn't usually expect to have an advertisement. Unlike typical public marketing campaigns that utilize billboards, street marketing involves the application of multiple techniques and practices in order to establish direct contact with the customers.Luxton, Sandra Lorraine and Lachlan Drummond. “What is this thing called 'Ambient Advertising'?” (2000). The goals of this interaction include causing an emotional reaction in potential customers, and getting people to remember brands in a different way.Hirschman, E.C. and B.B. Stern, 1999. The roles of emotion in consumer research. Adv. Consum. Res., 26: 4-11. Origin By definition, unconventional marketing exists in complete opposition to commercial marketing, which stems from the introduction of McCarthy's 4 Ps in 1960.Marketing and Advertising, vol. 14, no. 3, 2020, p. 336., doi:10.1504/ijima.2020.108726. Over the last five decades, street marketing has become an evolving topic of discussion, especially among SME's (small and medium-sized enterprises) who have little or no advertising budget. In the 1960s and 1970s, street marketing was a massive success since many consumers did not inevitably recognize guerrilla activities as an advertisement at this time because of its uncommon nature.Levinson, Jay (1998). Guerrilla Marketing. New York, New York: Houghton Mifflin Company. pp. 1–89. . The concept of \\"street marketing\\" was first mentioned and analyzed by Jay Conrad Levinson in his 1984 book Guerrilla Marketing. Levinson came up with the idea of this new approach to brand promotion when a student of his asked about a book for marketers without big budgets. After discovering that there was no such book, Levinson decided to write it himself. Thus, the new strategy for SME's was born: “small budget, big results,” which claimed to help many businesses survive in the 1980s and 1990s through these innovative advertising activities.Kim, J., M. Bhargawa and S. Ramaswami, 2001. Advertising productivity: Developing an agenda for research. Int. J. Advertising, 20: 431-454. Early on, the distribution of leaflets, coupons, posters or fliers made up the earliest form of street marketing and could be used in a strategic way to advertise to consumers for smaller businesses. The ease of using this kind of advertising strategy triggered a huge increase in the number of small businesses being opened.Katharina Hutter and Stefan Hoffmann, 2011. Guerrilla Marketing: The Nature of the Concept and Propositions for Further Research. Asian Journal of Marketing, 5: 39-54. There were two combined factors that carried street marketing to success; the first being that consumers had grown cynical and began to feel overwhelmed by the over-saturation of advertisements; the second was a shifting economic environment that forced businesses to create cost-effective ways to market their products. By the time the 2008 financial crisis hit, many large businesses were forced to cut their communication budgets drastically. In 2012, advertising revenue suffered a sharp drop, with television dropping 4.2% and a 8.1% drop for newspaper and press.Roux, Thérèse, and Marcel Saucet. “From Dancing on the Street to Dating Online: Evaluating Guerrilla Street Marketing Performance.” International Journal of Internet These new budget cuts forced larger businesses and corporations to now adopt a new, unconventional way of advertising and promotion in the form of street marketing. Comparison with guerrilla marketing Street marketing is a subset of guerrilla marketing, which is about investing time, energy, and imagination into a business campaign. Guerrilla marketing is popular among large and small businesses alike, as it uses low-cost unconventional communications which can provide a higher impact for a given investment. The use of viral marketing and engagement marketing help to heighten this impact. Guerrilla marketing exploits services which already exist, such as social networking sites, to create brand awareness. This could be spread by word of mouth or by exploiting social media.Gökerik, Mehmet, et al. “Surprise Me with Your Ads! The Impacts of Guerrilla Marketing in Social Media on Brand Image.” Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, vol. 30, no. 5, 2018, pp. 1222–1238., doi:10.1108/apjml-10-2017-0257. Viral messages appeal to individuals who already make high use of social networking, and because the messages do not look like traditional advertising the target audience is less likely to ignore them. Guerrilla marketing targets those who are more likely to share the message with others. Street marketing has the characteristic of being non- conventional. However, unlike other forms of guerrilla marketing, it is limited to the streets or public places and does not make use of other media or processes to establish communication with customers. One popular technique of street marketing is to place advertisements such as billboards and static ads in unexpected or random locations, such as down alleys or behind large buildings. Although the ad itself is conventional, the unexpected placement is intriguing and people may take an extra moment to ponder the ad.[8] Street marketing may also use brand ambassadors (typically one that appeals to the target demographic) who give away samples and coupons to customers that stop and take time to answer questions. Street marketing can be used as a general term encompassing six principal types of activities: * Distribution of flyers or products – this activity is more traditional and the most common form of street marketing employed by brands. * Product animations – the redressing of a high-traffic space using brand imagery. The idea is to create a micro- universe in order to promote a new product or service. * Human animations – creating a space in which the brand's message is communicated through human activity. * Roadshows – a mobile presentation, often using atypical transportation such as a taxibike, Segway, etc. * Uncovered actions – the customization of street elements. * Event actions – spectacles, such as flash mobs or contests. The idea is to promote a product, service, or brand value through the organization of a public event. Before implementing a street- marketing plan, companies and their marketing firms should understand how they are perceived in the marketplace, how their products differ from those of competitors and what their most-appealing features are, and what markets they want to target. After identifying their target customers and where these people gather, specific goals for a street-marketing campaign can be established. Campaign development A successful street marketing campaign strives to meet any combination of the following objectives: 1\\\\. Communicate with consumers in their natural, day-to-day environment. 2\\\\. Generate \\"buzz\\" or word of mouth around a product, brand, cause, or institution. 3\\\\. Create brand awareness and loyalty through real-life participation in memorable experiences. Over the years, street marketing has developed to include campaigns that use the street as a platform for experiences lived by the consumers through interaction with products/brands and the actors or props mobilized for that purpose. Public places for the campaign should be identified, such as beaches, cultural events, places close to schools, sporting events and recreation centers for children. Companies then develop a plan to attract different media and the target market. Street marketing events involve unusual activities and technology, in order to gain the attention of potential consumers. Plans should take into account global communication; the campaign interacts directly with the customers and media at the scene, and through them has the potential to reach a much wider audience. They may also be developed to identify opportunities and collect information about products, markets and competitors. To retain customers, strategies are implemented to prevent losing market position and the street marketing campaign may be augmented with supplemental advertisement through other mediums, such as radio and television.  Legal Concerns  Despite the fact that street marketing campaigns can be highly cost-effective and successful in creating brand loyalty, there are legal concerns that can pop up. By definition, street mobilization campaigns require the use of public space, and that use must be authorized by government authorities to be legal. This includes seemingly simple operations like distributing flyers and handing out coupons.Ay, Canan, et al. “Guerrilla Marketing Communication Tools and Ethical Problems in Guerilla Advertising.” American Journal of Economics and Business Administration, vol. 2, no. 3, 2010, pp. 280–286., doi:10.3844/ajebasp.2010.280.286. Because of the nature of street marketing, other legal concerns can involve trespassing on private property, defacing private or public property and not getting direct permission from these property owners. O'Sullivan, P. and P. Murphy, 1998. Ambush marketing: The ethical issues. Psychol. Market., 15: 349-366.  Ethical Problems  Certain street marketing campaigns that are not executed properly can lead to certain ethical issues, like the 2007 Turner Broadcasting Bomb Scare in Boston, where the company placed LED placards in the shape of a film character for an upcoming movie campaign throughout Boston in random locations. When these placards lit up they resembled characteristics of explosive devices and resulted in the company paying 2 million dollars in fines. Lothian, Dan. “Turner, Contractor to Pay $2M in Boston Bomb Scare.” CNN, Cable News Network, 1 Feb. 2007, edition.cnn.com/2007/US/02/05/boston.turner/index.html. Of course, a provocative campaign that creates awareness and attention is the primary objective of street marketing. However, advertising that becomes too persistent or intruding might also evoke negative emotions such as disappointment, sadness, anger, and fury. Certain campaigns that receive excess attention while also having a negative image could create an impact on the downstream criteria of the chain of effects (e.g., image, purchase intention, loyalty).Hirschman, E.C. and B.B. Stern, 1999. The roles of emotion in consumer research. Adv. Consum. Res., 26: 4-11. Examples The majority of street marketing campaigns have been from small companies, but large companies have also been involved. Most of the examples put into action include costumed persons, the distribution of tickets, and people providing samples. Stencil promoting a documentary in Belgium Distribution of fliers can create awareness in consumers. One example of this took place in Montpelier, Vermont, where the New England Culinary Institute (NECI) sent a group of students to a movie theater to hand out 400 fliers. Those fliers had coupons in which NECI invited people to its monthly theme dinners. Another company, Boston's Kung-Fu Tai Chi Club, chose the option of disseminating fliers to promote its self-defense classes for women. Other businesses apply the technique of sending disguised people to promote things on the streets. For example, a dating website organized a street marketing activity in the \\"Feria del Libro\\" (\\"Book Fair\\") in Madrid. It consisted of a man dressed like a prince who walked among the crowd looking for his \\"true love\\", and got some women to try on a glass slipper. A woman followed him distributing bookmarks with messages such as \\"Times have changed; the way to find love, too\\" with the website's address. In Madrid and Barcelona, a campaign called \\"Avestruz\\" (\\"Ostrich\\") used a group of life-sized ostrich puppets to interact with young people to promote mobile phones. There are enterprises that disseminate passes or tickets to concerts and other events sponsored by a company. A more unusual example is a French fashion retailer which promoted a new store by distributing denim in the neighborhood. An Italian campaign for a video game plastered the streets with Post-it Notes shaped like game characters. Some street marketing may incite the ire of local authorities, such as when an agency attached a styrofoam replica of a car to the side of a downtown building in Houston, Texas. For the cost of a small city-issued fine, the company received front-page advertising in the Houston Chronicle.

It occupies a narrow-necked promontory formed by a curve of the river, which acts as the border between England and Wales. Little remains of the village today, except for the roofless church of St. James.  History  The peninsula forms a strong natural defensive position and the ramparts of an Iron Age fort, known as Spital Meend, across this neck may still be identified today. The site of the fort looks both north and south up and down the Wye, as well as eastwards towards the Severn estuary. The name of Lancaut (historically, sometimes also spelled Llancourt) The English Cyclopaedia, 1867 is an anglicisation of the , or 'Church of Saint Cewydd', an obscure Welsh saint of the 6th century. Offa's Dyke, which was constructed in the late 8th century to define the area controlled by the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia and to deter incursions by the Welsh from the west, passed to the east of Lancaut, and incorporated part of the defences of the Spital Meend hillfort. The peninsula and parish of Lancaut, though on the eastern bank of the river, remained under Welsh control until the 10th century; C. R. Elrington et al., Victoria County History, A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 10: Westbury and Whitstone Hundreds, 1972, pp.50-72 by 956 it had been incorporated within the English king's manor of Tidenham. The village was never large, but in 1306 contained 10 tenant households, and in 1551 had 19 adults. By 1750 the village had only two inhabited houses, and in 1848 the parish was recorded as having a mere 16 inhabitants. The civil parish was merged with Tidenham in 1935. Today there is little remaining of the village except for a still-working farm. In early 1645, during the English Civil War, the local Royalist leader Sir John Wintour (or Winter) marched forces from Lydney to Lancaut in an attempt to fortify a ford across the Wye, but was defeated and forced to escape by boat. This gave rise to the local legend that he had leapt with his horse down the cliffs immediately below Lancaut to safety, the cliffs later becoming known as Wintour's Leap. 12th-century arch across the chancel Piscina  St James' Church  Today the only significant trace of the village above ground is the church of St James, which is a Grade II listed building within the site of a scheduled monument. Ecclesiastical records in the Book of Llandaff refer to a religious establishment of lann ceuid probably at this location, which is likely to have been established by 625 AD.Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, Lancaut and Ban-y-Gor Nature Reserves, local leaflet., pp. 125—126 A monastery was recorded here by 703. However, the construction of the church dates from the 12th century, the arch remaining across the chancel dating from this period. The theory has been put forward that the settlement was connected to the Cistercian monks who founded their substantial Abbey up-river at Tintern in 1131. A cast lead font in the church, comparable to other local examples from the same mould, can be dated precisely to between 1120 and 1140. This font is now in the Lady Chapel of Gloucester cathedral. Another suggestion is that it may once have been the site of a leper colony, Picturesque, Wye Valley AONB Newsletter, Autumn 2010, p.10 and an unusual number of medicinal herbs including the non-native elecampane - once used to treat respiratory ailments - and green hellebore have been found in and around the churchyard. Until 1711 the church was an independent ecclesiastical parish. After this date it was merged with another local parish, the new living being the rectory of Woolaston. Despite this, the church appears to have been substantially restored and rebuilt after this time. The double bell window still visible in the West wall was supplemented by a small bell turret in the roof above. In 1840 the antiquarian George Ormerod made drawings that record the church as having box pews and a pulpit fitted inside. By the 1860s though, the parish congregation was reduced in number and services were only being held here during the summer months. In 1865, the Rector of Woolaston ordered that the church be abandoned. The roof and the interior fittings, together with the font, were removed. Church and village both declined after this time, and the church was deconsecrated. In the 1980s the chancel arch partially collapsed, prompting some restoration and consolidation work, together with archaeological study. Repairs were undertaken to the churchyard wall in 2010. In December 2013, the church building was purchased for a nominal fee of £1 by the Forest of Dean Buildings Preservation Trust. The Trust intends to carry out a programme to stabilise the building. \\"It's yours for a quid!\\", Forest of Dean and Wye Valley Review, 11 December 2013. Retrieved 13 December 2013 Nature Reserves and Wildlife Lancaut, together with the adjacent woodland at Ban-y-Gor immediately to the north, was established in 1971 as a nature reserve, now managed by the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is within the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Both reserves are part of the nationally important Lower Wye Gorge SSSI.Natural England unit information for Lower Wye Gorge Fuller information may be found in the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook.Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al, 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, 'Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust' The River Wye at Lancaut supports a range of wildlife including otters, porpoises, cormorants, goosanders and herons. The woodland contains dormice, the rare lapidary snail, and uncommon plants such as narrow-leaved helleborine and the wild service tree. The narrow tidal banks are a rare example in Britain of a direct transition between natural saltmarsh and woodland. Fishing was historically important in the area, and the river contains traces of several medieval weirs, but salmon numbers have fallen markedly in recent years. Environment Quarrying for limestone was important from medieval times, and the remains of two adjoining limekilns may be seen on the hillside above the church. Although as of January 2011 these had partially collapsed making them unsafe to enter. It developed as a major industry after the building of Avonmouth Docks in 1877, and jetties were built at Lancaut to allow the transport of stone down the river. The quarry at Woodcroft, overlooking Lancaut, operated until the mid-twentieth century.  Access  The River Wye at Lancaut, looking towards the cliffs at Wintour's Leap The only road access to Lancaut is a narrow track to the farm. The church stands below this, down a steep bank. It can also be accessed by foot from Woodcroft, along part of the route of a circular walk from Chepstow which takes around 4 miles, across the 1816 Wye bridge, along the lower banks of the Wye to the church, then climbing up and returning along much the same route, but atop the cliffs of Wintour's Leap. This walk passes through the distinctive woodland of the Wye valley, including such rare and locally endemic species as the small-leaved lime. It crosses a scree slope of large boulders, created when an illegal post-war stone quarry blasted some of the limestone cliffs.

The Dual System of Government is the traditional diarchal political system of Tibetan peoples whereby the Desi (temporal ruler) coexists with the spiritual authority of the realm, usually unified under a third single ruler. The actual distribution of power between institutions varied over time and location. The Tibetan term Cho-sid-nyi (; alternate spellings include Chhos- srid-gnyis, Chhoe-sid-nyi, and Chos-sid-nyi) literally means \\"both Dharma and temporal,\\" but may also be translated as \\"dual system of religion and politics.\\" Because the ultimate ruler is the patron and protector of state religion, some aspects of the dual system of government may be likened to the Supreme Governance of the Church of England, or even to theocracy. However, other aspects resemble secularism, aiming to separate the doctrines of religion and politics. Under the Cho-sid-nyi, both religious and temporal authorities wield actual political power, albeit within officially separate institutions. Religious and secular officials might work side by side, each responsible to different bureaucracies. History The Tibetan Kashag in 1938–39. From 1751 to 1951, the Kashag replaced the office of Desi in the Cho- sid-nyi (dual system) of Tibet Since at least the period of the Mongol presence in Tibet during the 13th and 14th centuries, Buddhist and Bön clerics had participated in secular government, having the same rights as laymen to be appointed state officials, both military and civil. This system stood in stark contrast with that of China, in which the Buddhist view of politics as a \\"dismal science\\" as well as the Confucian monopoly on the bureaucracy precluded such political activity by the Sangha. By the Ming Dynasty (founded 1368), the Sakya held office above the heads of both components, embodying a government of both chos and srid. As a result, there were two sets of laws and officials, the religious () and the temporal (), however the branches shared the government and did not operate exclusively of each other. This system often operated under Mongol and Chinese overlordshipWhether historical Mongol/Chinese power over Tibet is classified as suzerainty or sovereignty is debated, with views often split along modern political lines. with the respective emperor above the local Tibetan administration. The Tibetan form of government from 1642 until 1951 was the Cho-sid-nyi. The dual system was implemented during a period of consolidation under the Fifth Dalai Lama (r. 1642–1682), who unified Tibet religiously and politically after a prolonged civil war. He brought the government of Tibet under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler, the Tsangpa prince. The Tibetan model sought to produce a synthesis of the complementary components of the mundane norm: Dharma () and Samsara (). One basic assumption of this system is that the temporal lord depended on religion for legitimacy, while the institution of state religion depended on patronage and protection from the political élite. In 1751, the Seventh Dalai Lama abolished the post of Desi (or Regent), in whom too much power had been placed. The Desi was replaced by the Kashag (Council) to represent the civil administration. The Dalai Lama thus became the spiritual and political leader of Tibet. Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal instituted the Tibetan Cho-sid-nyi (dual system) in Bhutan In Bhutan, the Cho-sid-nyi was established by Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in the 17th century under the code known as the Tsa Yig. Having fled sectarian persecution in Tibet, Ngawang Namgyal established the Drukpa Lineage as the state religion. Under the Bhutanese system, the powers of the government were split between the religious branch headed by the Je Khenpo of the Drukpa Lineage and the civil administrative branch headed by the Druk Desi. Both the Je Khenpo and Druk Desi were under the nominal authority of the Shabdrung, a reincarnation of Ngawang Namgyal. After the death of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, Bhutan nominally followed the dual system of government. In practice, the Shabdrung was often a child under the control of the Druk Desi, and regional penlops (governors) often administered their districts in defiance of the Druk Desi until the rise of the unified monarchy at the beginning of the 20th century. In Ladakh and Sikkim, two related Chogyal dynasties reigned with absolute control, punctuated by periods of invasion and colonization by Tibet, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and the British Empire. The basis of the Chogyal monarchy in both Ladakh and Sikkim was its recognition by Three Lamas, and the title Chogyal (; \\"Dharma Raja\\" or \\"Religious King\\") itself refers to the dual system of government. Ladakh's Namgyal dynasty lasted from 1470 until 1834. The autonomy of the Tibetan élite in Ladakh, as well as their system of government, ended with the campaigns of General Zorawar Singh and Rajput suzerainty. Ladakh became a region within the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir until 2019, when it was formed into a separate union territory. The Namgyal dynasty continued in Sikkim from 1542 until 1975, when the kingdom voted by plebiscite to join the union of India. Contemporary systems=Kingdom of Bhutan The Bhutanese Druk Gyalpo Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck is the embodiment of the Cho-sid-nyi under the Constitution of Bhutan The only modern example of a sovereign government operating under the Cho-sid-nyi is Bhutan, although it exists in a highly modified form. In 1907, in an effort to reform the dysfunctional political system, the penlops (governors) of Bhutan orchestrated the establishment of a Bhutanese monarchy with Ugyen Wangchuck, the penlop of Trongsa installed as hereditary king, with the support of Britain and against the wishes of Tibet. Since the establishment of the Wangchuck dynasty in 1907, the office of the Druk Desi has been held by the reigning Druk Gyalpo (King of Bhutan). Under the monarchy, the relative influence of the Je Khenpo has diminished. Nonetheless, the position remains a powerful one and the Je Khenpo is typically viewed as the closest and most powerful advisor to the Druk Gyalpo. The office of Shabdrung has fared less well, and has been subsumed by the office of the Druk Gyalpo. The royal family suffered from questions of legitimacy in its early years, with the reincarnations of the various Shabdrungs posing a threat. According to one Drukpa source, the Shabdrung's brother Chhoki Gyeltshen challenged the 1926 accession of King Jigme Wangchuck. He was rumored to have met with Mahatma Gandhi to garner support for the Shabdrung against the King. The Seventh Shabdrung, Jigme Dorji was then \\"retired\\" to Talo monastery and died in 1931, under rumors of assassination. He was the last Shabdrung recognized by Bhutan; subsequent claimants to the incarnation have not been recognized by the government. In 1962, Jigme Ngawang Namgyal, known as Shabdrung Rimpoche to his followers, fled Bhutan for India where he spent the remainder of his life. Until 2002, Bhutanese pilgrims were able to journey to Kalimpong, just south of Bhutan, to visit with the Master. On April 5, 2003, the Shabdrung died. Some of his followers claim he was poisoned, while Kuensel took pains to explain he died after an extended bout with cancer. In early 2007, reports alleged that the current Shabdrung Pema Namgyel, then a small child, had been held under house arrest in Bhutan along with his parents since 2005 after being invited to Bhutan from his home in India. The Constitution of Bhutan, enacted in 2008, confirms Bhutan's commitment to the Cho-sid-nyi system. However the title \\"Druk Desi\\" never appears in the Constitution, and all administrative powers are vested in the Druk Gyalpo and civilian offices directly. Furthermore, the Druk Gyalpo appoints the Je Khenpo on advice of the Five Lopons, and the democratic Constitution itself is the supreme law of the land, as opposed to a Shabdrung figurehead. In the 2008 Constitution, there is no reference whatsoever to the office of Shabdrung. Government of Tibet in exile The Parliament of the Tibetan government in exile consists of 43–46 members including 10 religious delegates (2 members each from the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the traditional Bön school). Aside from seats reserved for religious representatives, offices are generally open to clerics: the Prime Minister of its Parliament is Lobsang Tenzin, a Buddhist monk. The administration of the government in exile was headed for decades by the Dalai Lama, but in 2011, he ceded his temporal (secular) powers, keeping only his role as spiritual leader.

The specific epithet honours Dr John Grant- Mackie, Associate Professor of Geology at Auckland University, in recognition of his support for graduate students and for contributions to avian palaeontology.Millener (1988).

Nierva (born 24 February 1980) is a poet, teacher, journalist, theatre actor, translator, graphic and book designer, and a cultural advocate. He is from the Bikol region of the Philippines. Early life Nierva was born in Naga City. His father was Estelito Aguila Nierva, a railway official. His mother was Grace Pacay Tino, a teacher. His early education came in the central school of Lupi, a rural railroad town in the province of Camarines Sur. This lowly, riverine and hilly town appears in Nierva's poetry. In many literary gatherings he would admit that the town is one of his richest sources of poetic inspiration. Nierva finished basic education in 1992 and entered Ateneo de Naga University (AdNU) for high school and college. In 2000, he earned his degree in Development Communication.  Career  He became a faculty member of AdNU's Department of Media Studies. He works as a freelance writer, translator, and graphic and industrial designer. He is studying for a Masters in Creative Writing at the University of the Philippines Diliman. In 2007, his first book, Antisipasyon asin iba pang Rawitdawit sa Bikol asin Ingles (Anticipation and other Poems in Bikol and English), was published. He maintains a column entitled \\"Mayon Limited\\" in the online Bikol news hub, Vox Bikol. Danton Remoto stated: \\"In less enlightened times, poetry was thought to have been written only in the metropolis, seen as the center of culture and taste. In the last ten years, regional publishing has begun to produce excellent books of literature. One of them is Antisipasyon asin iba pang Rawitdawit sa Bikol asin Ingles, written by Victor Dennis T. Nierva and published by Goldprint, Naga City. Images of the poet's Bicol Region are luxuriant in this book. They are memories, presences, and forebodings. But always, the poet's pen is restrained, the images and lines chiseled. This is a young poet's book, but some of the poems in this collection—whether in their original Bikol or translated into English—are already some of the best poems of his generation. For the lapidary quality of his poetry, the National Book Award for Poetry is given to Antisipasyon asin iba pang rawitdawit sa Bikol asin Ingles.\\" His second book, Doros asin mga Anghel (Translations in Bikol of John Donne's Holy Sonnets and Selected Works) was released by Ateneo de Naga University Press in January 2012.

Her husband found out about the relationship a year later and threw Powers out of their home, having heard about the affair from his servants and then reading details about the relationship in his wife's diary. He was said to have considered divorcing his wife but was afraid of the negative publicity, and knew that under a prenuptial agreement that he had signed, his wife would get half of everything he owned. After the couple separated, Candy Mossler gave Powers money to buy a mobile home business. Employees there testified under oath that Powers had made threats that he would kill Mr. Mossler, who was found dead on June 30, 1964.

Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman led the expedition to clear General Joseph E. Johnston's relief effort from the Vicksburg area. The mission was successful and helped ensure that the Mississippi River remained in Union possession for the remainder of the war. Background In the Vicksburg Campaign, one of the intermediate battles was the Battle of Jackson on May 14, 1863, in which Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee captured the capital city of Jackson, Mississippi, but then evacuated it to move west toward Vicksburg. During the Siege of Vicksburg Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton's beleaguered garrison. Johnston cautiously advanced his 30,000 soldiers toward the rear of Grant's army surrounding Vicksburg. In response, Grant ordered Sherman to deal with Johnston's threat. Expedition By July 1, 1863, Johnston's force was in position along the Big Black River. Sherman used the newly arrived IX Corps to counter this threat. On July 5, the day after the surrender of Vicksburg was made official, Sherman was free to move against Johnston. Johnston hastily withdrew his force across the Big Black River and Champion's Hill battlefields with Sherman in pursuit. Sherman had with him the IX Corps, XV Corps, XIII Corps, and a detachment of the XVI Corps. Siege of Jackson Siege of Jackson On July 10, the Union Army had taken up position around Jackson. The heaviest fighting came on July 12, during an unsuccessful Union attack.Thompson, p. 388. Brig. Gen. Jacob Gartner Lauman ordered a brigade under Col. Isaac C. Pugh to attack the Confederate works manned by Brig. Gen. Daniel Weisiger Adams's brigade. As a result, Lauman was relieved of command for failing to properly carry out the orders of his superior, Maj. Gen. Edward Ord, which resulted in heavy casualties.Gue, p. 164. Instead of risking entrapment, Johnston chose to evacuate the state capital and withdrew on July 16. Sherman's forces occupied the city on the following day. The re-capture of the city effectively ended the last threat to Vicksburg.

Biography Cornélie van Oosterzee was born on August 16, 1863 to Pieter Cornélis van Oosterzee and Johanna Theophanie Bernardina in Jakarta (then Batavia). She had six siblings: three brothers and three sisters. At the age of 5, Cornelie moved with her family to The Hague from Jakarta. There, she began piano lessons with Carel Wirtz at the Royal Conservatoire The Hague and at age 16 started music theory lessons under composer and organist Willem Nicolaï. Her studies ended in 1883, when her family moved to the Dutch East Indies. Describing the end of her musical career as a \\"great cover-up\\" in letters to Clara Schumann, Cornelie asked for advice about the future, and was encouraged to pursue a career as a concert pianist. Returning to the Netherlands upon the death of her mother in 1888, Cornélie resumed her classes with Nicolaï but left soon after for Berlin upon the advice of her friends Julius Rontgen and Johannes Masschaert. After 2 years in Berlin, she moved to Stuttgart to study with composers Samuel de Lange and Robert Radecke. Soon she returned to Berlin upon her acceptance into Heinrich Urban's Master School of Instrumental Composers. In Berlin, Cornélie Van Oosterzee wrote primarily orchestral works.

As an historian, Le Prevost pioneered, along with his friend Arcisse de Caumont, research on the Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Normandy and France. In 1824, he cofounded with de Caumont, Charles de Gerville and Father Gervais de La Rue, the Société des Antiquaires de Normandie, a veritable \\"school in motion of specialists of architecture\\".Matthias Noell, Classement und classification: Ordnungssysteme der Denkmalpflege in Frankreich und Deutschland, Berlin, 2 avril 2005. He was elected a member of the Académie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Rouen in 1813, and chaired, on various occasions, the learned societies of Seine- Inférieure and Eure. He was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1838. Le Prévost, who was fascinated by the History of Normandy, published the five volumes of the Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis' work. He showed his versatility by authoring, among many scientific papers, a Discours sur la poésie romantique in 1825. In 1830, he published two sets of detailed notes on the important discovery of \\"the treasure of Berthouville\\", a fabulous collection of Gallo-Roman silverware listed today among the most valuable pieces medal cabinet of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. He is responsible for the restoration of the Parlement de Normandie in Rouen and conservation of Roman theater of Lillebonne. He began a political career with his election as general counselor in Bernay in 1831, then as deputy in 1834. He was consistently re-elected until the Orleans family fell from power after the French Revolution of 1848. he did not oppose the republic, but said humorously, \\"The Republic and I greet one another, but we do not talk.\\"Quoted by Gilles Rossignol, Eure. Le guide, La Renaissance du livre, 2001. He then resumed scholarly activities he had never really abandoned, and earned the nickname of \\"Norman Pausanias\\". When he died in 1859, he had gone almost blind. He is featured in Jean de La Varende's most famous novel, Leather-Nose (1936), when the hero, Roger Tainchebraye, meets \\"a black man feverishly measuring, looking, counting, an active and tiny insect: it was Auguste Le Prevost, the archaeologist of Bernay, semi-founder of the science that would get such a upswing\\" walks through the ruins of the Abbey of Saint-Evroul. Nez- de-Cuir also mentions a mysterious crypt in the abbey with \\"miscellaneous valuables, rings and bits of sticks, which come from a discovery made around here\\"... The innumerable unpublished Notes historiques et archéologiques by Le Prevost were later published in several volumes between 1866 and 1869 by Louis Passy and Léopold Delisle. They have been widely used by generations of researchers, and are still authoritative. Le Prévost was appointed sub-prefect of Bernay in August 1814 before he was discharged in November 1815. A street of his native town of Bernay was named after him.

He has also represented the British and Irish Lions. His usual position is wing, but he has also played at outside centre. North is the second highest all time try scorer for Wales behind Shane Williams. Early life North was born in 1992 in King's Lynn. His father is English from Yorkshire and his Welsh mother is from Anglesey. The family moved to Anglesey when he was aged two and he is a fluent Welsh language speaker. North was educated at Ysgol Uwchradd Bodedern on Anglesey and later at Llandovery College. Club career North played as a junior for Llangefni, Pwllheli, Rhyl and Gogledd Cymru under-16s. Scarlets: 2010–2013 Before his international call-up, North had played six matches for the Scarlets first team, a record restricted by an injury. Northampton Saints: 2013–2018 On 9 April 2013 it was confirmed that North would sign for Northampton Saints in the English Premiership for a reported fee of over £200,000. This announcement followed the Welsh Rugby Union claiming that Scarlets had attempted to sell North to French clubs, which had been rejected. He scored his first Northampton Saints try against Sale Sharks after some excellent work by Jamie Elliott to make the score 12–0 in a game that finished 33–14 to Northampton. He scored his first Heineken Cup try for Saints on 14 December against Leinster Rugby. He started as Northampton beat Saracens to win the Premiership final. North scored his 150th point for Saints with a try against Exeter Chiefs in the English Premiership on 30 September 2016. North was instrumental in Saints securing a European Rugby Champions Cup place for the 2017–18 season as the side beat both Connacht Rugby and Stade Francais in the European Champions Cup play-off games to claim the final spot in the competition for the following season. Return to Wales: 2018 On 22 November 2017, the Welsh Rugby Union announced that it had signed North to a National Dual Contract, with the WRU funding 60% and a Welsh region funding the remainder, that would take effect upon the expiry of North's contract with Northampton Saints at the end of the 2017–18 season. At the time of announcement, it had not yet been determined which of Wales' four Pro14 sides North would join. On 25 April 2018, the WRU announced that North would join the Ospreys effective with the 2018–19 season. International career After an impressive start to the 2010 season, in October 2010, he was selected to the 33-man squad for the Autumn international series. On 11 November 2010, North was named in the Wales team to face South Africa on 13 November, making him the joint-third youngest player to represent Wales behind Tom Prydie and Norman Biggs and equal to Evan Williams. North made an impressive start to his international career on 13 November 2010 in a match against the reigning world champions, by scoring two tries for Wales as they lost to South Africa 29–25 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. He set a number of Welsh and international records in the match: * North, aged , became the youngest player ever to score a try in his debut for Wales. The previous record holder was Tom Pearson, who was aged 18 years, 238 days when he scored against England in 1891. * He also became the youngest player ever to have scored two tries against a major rugby nation, whether on his debut or not. The previous record holder was James O'Connor of Australia, who was aged 18 years, 343 days when he scored a hat-trick against Italy in 2009. (Taylor Paris of Canada turned 18 in October 2010 and scored two tries in his second appearance against Spain on the same day as North's debut, but Spain is also not considered a major rugby nation, although they have qualified for one World Cup.) Following his international debut at the 2010 end-of-year tests, North soon became a regular fixture for Wales in their starting XV. He was not picked to play for Wales for most of the 2011 Six Nations as coach Warren Gatland generally opted for more experienced wingers Shane Williams and Morgan Stoddart, however during the final weekend of the tournament North was given his opportunity to start on the left wing against France, as Williams was not picked to play and Stoddart was on the replacements bench. 2011 Rugby World Cup After Morgan Stoddart suffered a broken leg during a World Cup warm-up match against England, North was called up as a first-choice winger for Wales for the 2011 Rugby World Cup held in New Zealand. He started on the left wing for Wales' first Pool D match against South Africa, which they narrowly lost by a score of 17–16 against the reigning world champions. North again started on the wing against Samoa and then came on as a replacement in the 55th minute against Namibia, scoring two tries in the latter. He then started against Fiji, scoring a try. North started on the right wing in Wales' 22–10 win over Ireland in their quarter-final. They went on to face France in the semi- finals, but lost 9–8, with North again on the right wing. Six Nations titles in 2012 and 2013 After the World Cup, North continued in his place as a regular starter for Wales. He scored a late try as Wales beat Ireland 23–21 in the opening game of the 2012 Six Nations, and he went on to start all four of the remaining matches as Wales claimed their first Grand Slam since 2008. He then played in every minute of the 2013 Six Nations, scoring the only try of the game as Wales won their first match away to France since 2005. Defeat to Ireland on the opening weekend meant Wales needed a seven-point margin of victory against England in their final match to claim the title; although North failed to score, they ended up winning 30–3 and retained the title for the first time since 1979. 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia He was named as part of the Lions squad for the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. On 22 June in Brisbane, North scored the first Lions try vs Australia; a run from inside his own 10-metre line beating four players. However, North's celebration was slightly over exuberant and he later apologised, saying he felt 'horrendous' after making a triumphant gesture towards Will Genia. The Lions went on to win the First Test 23–21. On 29 June 2013, North carried out a 'fireman's lift' manoeuvre on Australia's Israel Folau while running with the ball in the Second Test between the Lions and Australia in Melbourne, injuring himself in the process as the Lions went down to a 16–15 defeat. On 6 July 2013, in Sydney, North scored his 14th international try and his second Lions Test try as the Lions sealed a 2–1 series win over Australia with a 41–16 victory. Since 2014 North competed for Wales during the 2014 Six Nations, and started all five matches, including a switch to outside centre against France, with Wales hoping that North's size and strength would make him an adequate opponent against the 19-stone frame of Mathieu Bastareaud, who was starting in the same position for Les Bleus. The plan worked, as Wales won 27–6, with North scoring a try after 5 minutes of play. North played four of Wales' five games during the 2015 Six Nations, only missing the match against Scotland in the second round due to a concussion he suffered against England the week before. At the 2015 Rugby World Cup, North played in all but one of Wales' pool matches, rested for the opening match against the bottom side in the group, Uruguay. Although North failed to score, Wales recorded wins against Uruguay, England and Fiji, but defeat to Australia in the final pool match, in which North started at outside centre, meant they finished second in the pool and faced South Africa in the quarter-final at Twickenham. North returned to his usual position on the wing and played the full 80 minutes, but again failed to score and Wales ended up losing 23–19. North played for Wales during the 2016 Six Nations, scoring tries against Scotland, France, England and Italy. The winger was selected in the Wales squad for the Autumn Internationals and after Premiership Rugby decided to allow Welsh players to be selected for the opening test on 5 November 2016, despite that falling outside the designated International window, earned his 63rd cap for Wales against Australia on that day. After heavy criticism from his coaches and the media in 2017, North scored three tries in the 2017 Six Nations, one against Italy on 5 February and a double against Ireland on 10 March, becoming the joint-highest try scorer of the tournament with seven other players. His two tries against Ireland bought his career tally to 32, making him the fourth highest try scorer in Welsh history. After New Zealand winger Julian Savea was dropped from the team for the 2017 Rugby Championship, this made North the highest try scored of all currently active Tier 1 international players. North was selected by the British and Irish Lions for their tour of New Zealand, alongside his Northampton team-mate Courtney Lawes. North played in three fixtures on the tour but was sent home early with fellow injured back Robbie Henshaw after tearing his hamstring. After missing the 2017 end-of-year tests due to injury, North was included in the Welsh squad for the 2018 Six Nations Championship. North did not play in the first week of the competition and returned from injury to play against England on 10 February 2018. Due to stiff competition for a starting place in the competition, North replaced Rhys Patchell off the bench against England with Wales losing 6–12. North was used as a replacement again in the second round of the competition before gaining his starting spot on the right wing back for the final two. North's performance against Italy on 11 March 2018 produced his only two tries of the 2018 Six Nations and allowed Wales to beat Italy 38–14. North's two tries in the 2018 Six Nations bought his career tally to 34. He then featured in all three tests of Wales' summer tour, scoring a try in the first test against Argentina in San Juan, and three of the four autumn internationals, scoring his 36th test try against Scotland and performing well against both Australia and South Africa. North's impressive return to form following his move back to Wales meant that he was an automatic choice for Wales' 2019 Six Nations Championship squad, and the starting XV against France. Despite a sloppy first half performance that allowed Yoann Huget to score in the left corner, North gave one of his best recent performances in the second half, scoring two tries and winning the Man of the Match award. North became a grand slam champion for the second time in his career, in the 2019 Six Nations, as they beat Ireland 25-7 in Cardiff. North was part of the Wales squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, scoring a try in the 76th minute of their match against Georgia. Personal life In June 2019 North married his long-term partner, the Olympic cyclist Becky James. On 5 May 2020 the couple announced the birth of their son Jac.https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/george- becky-north-announce-birth-18205205 ReferencesExternal links * *Scarlets Player Profile *News from Walesonline *Wales profile * Category:1992 births Category:Welsh people of English descent Category:Living people Category:People educated at Llandovery College Category:People educated at Ysgol Uwchradd Bodedern Category:People from Anglesey Category:Sportspeople from King's Lynn Category:Scarlets players Category:Rugby union wings Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from Wales ","title":"George North"},{"id":"29257452","text":"Tatul Altunyan's plaque in Yerevan Tatul Tigrani Altunyan (Altunian) (Armenian: Թաթուլ Տիգրանի Ալթունյան; October 2 (15), 1901, Adana, Adana Vilayet, Ottoman Empire - November 29, 1973, Yerevan, Armenia) was an Armenian conductor, the founder of Armenian State Song-Dance Ensemble (currently named after him), People's Artist of USSR (1965), recipient of the State Prize of the USSR (1950) and university professor.

History Kastrup Værk depicted by an unknown artist in 1730 Kastrup Værk was founded around 1750 by Jacob Fortling, a German sculptor who had emigrated to Denmark in 1729 and established a successful career as Royal Master Builder in Copenhagen. As one of several operators, he was granted rights to extract limestone on Saltholm, a smaller island in Øresund otherwise mainly used for summer grazing, and built an extensive complex of buildings between 1749 and 1753. Constructed on reclaimed land, it included a lime plant, a tile works and a faience factory as well as a main building and gate houses. When Fortling died in 1761, his widow sold the plant to Jess Didrichsen, father of Danish-Norwegian writer Christiane Koren. Together with Jacob Stentzler, he operated the industrial complex under the name Didrichsen and Compagnie. The new owners continued operations until 1777, when it was sold once more and converted for other uses. For a while, in the 19th century, it was used as a brewery. Kastrup Værk today Most of the buildings still exist today. It was renovated from 2006 to 2008 and turned into a mixture of residential units and offices. The location now lies between Copenhagen Airport and Amager Beach Park. The renovated buildings will be part of a larger redevelopment of the site, known as Scanport, will convert the old harbour into a marina and add a number of modern office buildings and hotel facilities. The masterplan for the area has been made by the architectural firm of schmidt hammer lassen. The new national Danish aquarium, The Blue Planet, is located on a neighbouring site.

Life  He was the son of an innkeeper and displayed an early aptitude for drawing. Two of the boarders at his parents' inn were drawing teachers and they encouraged him in his desire to be an artist. Wealthy relatives were won over to the cause and he was soon enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, later attending Charles University, where he studied philosophy.

From 1817 to 1825, he served as Court Painter to the House of Czernin and overseer for their collection of paintings in Vienna. He maintained close contact with many Czech scholars, such as Josef Dobrovský and František Palacký, which deepened his nationalistic feelings. After completing his work in Vienna, he received an Imperial Pension courtesy of Klemens von Metternich, who had been a regular visitor at the Czernins. He spent several years studying in Rome, where he was influenced by the Nazarene movement. He returned to Vienna in 1832, then moved on to Prague in 1836, when he became the first Czech to be appointed Director of the Art Academy. Josef Mánes and Karel Javůrek were among his best-known students there.

Biography He came from a humble family. As a child, he was apprenticed to a button and braid maker. After becoming a journeyman, he travelled throughout Europe and was particularly impressed by Switzerland, which led him to make some attempts at painting. He stayed briefly in Zürich and took some basic lessons from Johann Heinrich Wüest, but was otherwise entirely self-taught. The year 1811 found him in Prague, where he was hired by a button maker. After his employer died, he married his widow and took over the button business. Although successful at his trade, he began to paint more frequently and show his work at the shop. Soon, he was making more money from his paintings and had attracted the attention of the well-known landscape painter, Josef Navrátil. He also earned the admiration of the writer, Adalbert Stifter. He had four daughters. Two of them, Charlotte and Louisa, took lessons from him and also became landscape painters. He died on a farm just outside Prague and was originally buried at the evangelical cemetery in Karlín. Later, he was transferred to a plot at the Olšany Cemetery, which he shares with Louisa and Charlotte.

It is built for the Nguyễn Emperor Tự Đức and took three years to build from 1864-1867\\\\. It is divided into a Temple Area and a Tomb Area.  History  Emperor Tu Duc enjoyed the longest reign of any monarch of the Nguyen dynasty, ruling from 1848-83. Although he had over a hundred wives and concubines, he was unable to father a son (possibly he became sterile after contracting smallpox). Thus, it fell to him to write his own epitaph on the deeds of his reign. He felt this was a bad omen, but the epitaph can still be found inscribed on the stele in the pavilion just to the east of the Emperor's tomb. This stele is the largest of its type in Vietnam, and had to be brought here from a quarry over 500 kilometers away--a trip that took four years. Tu Duc began planning his tomb long before his death in 1883. The major portions of the tomb complex were completed from 1864-67, along with future temple buildings that served as a palatial retreat for Tu Duc and his many wives during his lifetime. Construction of the tomb demanded so much corvee labor and extra taxation that there was an abortive coup against Tu Duc in 1866. This was put down, and for the remainder of his life, Tu Duc continued to use the tomb's palace buildings as his place of residence. Amenities for the living are unmatched at any other tomb in Vietnam. Here, the Emperor could boat on the lake and hunt small game on the tiny island in the lake's middle. He could recline at Xung Khiem Pavilion and recite or compose poetry in the company of his concubines. After trips on the lake, the boats would moor at Du Khiem Pavilion, from which the Emperor and his entourage could walk directly west into the palace area of the tomb. After the Emperor's death in 1883 his adopted son Kien Phuc took over as the Nguyen Emperor. Perhaps because he only ruled seven months before dying, a separate tomb was not established for him. Instead, he was laid to rest in a small corner on the grounds of Tu Duc's tomb. Between the tombs of Tu Duc and his son is the tomb of Empress Le Thien Anh, Tu Duc's primary wife. Despite the grandeur of the site and the amount of time Tu Duc spent here, he was buried in a different, secret location somewhere in Hue. To keep the secret safe the 200 laborers who buried the king were all beheaded after they returned from the secret route. To this day, the real tomb of Tu Duc remains hidden.

Overview During the 1970s, a definitive running program for young athletes to continue competing outside of college did not exist in the United States (U.S.). The formation and success of Athletics West, together with the success and popularity of American runners like Craig Virgin (charter member), Steve Prefontaine, Frank Shorter and Bill Rodgers, helped inspire the 1970s running boom. Bowerman helped to popularize the concept of jogging in the U.S. by publishing Jogging in 1966, after meeting Arthur Lydiard in New Zealand in 1962. History=1970s In 1977 infrastructure and support was absent from the Amateur Athletic Union, the predecessor to USA Track and Field. Because of the demands for amateurism, young American runners needed to finance their own training and travel for competition. While scholastic and collegiate competitions took better care of student athletes, post-collegiate athletes were on their own, a demand was immensely challenging. Bowerman and Knight, who were runners themselves, recognized the situation that their sport existed in, so they decided to take the meager profits from their fledgling Nike company to try to reignite competitive running in the U.S. They recruited Harry Johnson, a high school coach who was known for his warden-like demeanor and rigorous training tactics. Johnson was the winningest coach in Oregon high school history, with the attainment of 25 state titles in his career. Johnson's first acquisition was Craig Virgin, a young Illinois, U.S. Virgin was joined by a team of gifted athletes, including Jim Crawford, an Army vet who specialized in the 1500 meters; Phil Kane, an accounting major and powerhouse in the 1,500-meter event; seminary student and marathoner Jeff Wells; Doug Brown; George Malley; and Mike Manke. (Mac Wilkins and shot putter Al Feuerbach signed on shortly thereafter.) Nationally, the Athletics West men performed well in competitions, with Wells winning the marathon in Honolulu, Virgin winning a title in the 5,000-meter event in Knoxville and Malley placing first in the 1,500-meter event in Corvallis, Oregon. The team then traveled to Europe for two months to engage in international-level competition for the first time. Athletics West's final American meet before their Europe trip was the national championship event, where Virgin won the club's first National Championship in the 10,000 meters, they swept the steeplechase, and Feuerbach won the shot put. In Europe, the team then competed against athletes who had benefited from years of state- sponsored training. However, every single Athletics West runner clocked personal bests while competing in Europe, including eight records apiece set by Virgin and Brown. Although the original nucleus of the team dissolved after the European tour, the experimental opening season of Athletics West was successful. Even though they had been two of the team's best performers, Virgin and Malley left the team due to Coach Johnson's dictatorial coaching style. Johnson announced at the conclusion of the team's first year: \\"Everybody understands and believes in our approach now. They realize the discipline and courage involved in taking a long-term approach to training. I think there's a different perspective now.\\" Between 1979 and 1989, Henry Marsh, Doug Brown and Brian Diemer swept the national steeplechase championship all in the Athletics West uniform. Diemer also won in 1990, but the team name had evolved into Nike International. 1980s Athletic West achieved further success in the U.S. in the 1980s in cross country running competitions. The team won the men's long course team competition on seven occasions: six in succession, from 1981 to 1986, and again in 1989. Anthony Sandoval won the 1980 U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon in 2:10:19 faster than the Olympic Marathon Winner that year. The Games were boycotted by the United States. During the team's second year, more athletes were recruited, doctors and medical testing were introduced, and world-class marathoner Alberto Salazar joined the team in the early 1980s. The team also included women athletes during this decade, such as Joan Benoit Samuelson and Mary Decker Slaney—the women's long course team won in competition six times: once in 1981 and then five consecutive times, from 1985 to 1989. Athletics West later established operations on the East Coast of the United States, prior to global expansion. Relatively unknown Tom Byers defeated a crowd of the top world class 1500 metres runners, including then world record holder Steve Ovett, at the 1981 Bislett Games while wearing an Athletics West uniform. Byers was in the race to be the pacemaker, but the peloton ran tactically and ignored Byers until it was too late. Jeff Drenth, an Athletics West team member, died in the team office following a workout in 1986. Aged 24 years at the time, the cause of Drenth's death remains unknown. Trademark Nike filed a U.S. federal trademark registration for the trademark of the Athletics West name on May 11, 2006. The registration was active until December 13, 2013, when it was canceled under Section 8. Allegations A 1992 book, Swoosh, The Unauthorized Story of Nike and the Men Who Played There, written by Julie Strasser and Laurie Becklund, alleged that Nike had arranged for under-the- table payments to athletes on the Athletics West team, which were forbidden at the time. The book also stated that many athletes on the team used steroids with Nike's knowledge, between 1977 and 1985. Performance-enhancing drugs are still illegal. References 1\\\\.

Biography Johnson made an early start in music when he began singing in his church choir at the age of six. His recording debut came six years later on Atlantic Records, which recorded his group the Humdingers, although the tracks remain unreleased. In 1961, and following a change in name to the Showmen, Johnson and the group recorded “It Will Stand”, a single for Minit Records. It was a chart hit in both 1961 and 1964. Although the Showmen recorded other offerings for Minit and Swan, including such hits as \\"39-21-46\\", they split up in 1968. Johnson attempted an abortive solo career before joining the then new Invictus label in Detroit, Michigan. Steered by Holland-Dozier-Holland, Johnson recruited Danny Woods (ex-The Showmen), Harrison Kennedy, and Eddie Curtis and created Chairmen of the Board. Their debut single \\"Give Me Just a Little More Time\\" rose to #3 in the U.S. Billboard R&B; chart in 1970. Additional hits included \\"(You've Got Me) Dangling on a String\\" and \\"Everything's Tuesday\\". Johnson commenced a career as songwriter with \\"Pay to the Piper\\", becoming a modest success for Chairmen of the Board. Other songs he wrote were successful when recorded by other musicians. These included the Grammy Award-winning \\"Patches\\" for Clarence Carter (Jerry Reed also recorded a country music version). Invictus Records labelmates Honey Cone recorded the Johnson penned tracks \\"Want Ads\\", \\"Stick Up\\", and \\"One Monkey Don't Stop No Show\\". Johnson also wrote \\"Bring the Boys Home\\" for Freda Payne. Chairmen of the Board's popularity diminished in the middle of the 1970s, although Johnson and Woods remained together re-billed as the Chairmen. Johnson tried a solo career again in 1976, and his debut solo album on Arista Records was a modest success. He teamed again with Woods in the following decade, making a living on the beach music circuit. In 1993, Johnson released the album What Goes Around Comes Around (recorded with Woods). In recognition of the contribution that Johnson has made to American popular music, the Virginia General Assembly designated June 9, 2001 as General Johnson Day in Virginia. Johnson died on October 13, 2010 in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. His obituary in The New York Times reported that his family attributed his death to complications of lung cancer. Other obituaries did not mention lung cancer but did note that he was recovering from recent knee surgery.

It is the largest freshwater invertebrate in Antarctica, at long. It lives on bacteria and other organisms, surviving the winter as resting eggs. Distribution B. gaini is found from \\"half-way down the Antarctic Peninsula\\" northwards, including southernmost South America and subantarctic islands such as South Georgia and the South Orkney Islands. It is the only fairy shrimp on mainland Antarctica, where it is \\"rather widespread on the Antarctic Peninsula\\"; records of \\"Branchinecta granulosa\\" from Antarctica are all misidentifications of B. gaini. In the South Shetland Islands, B. gaini has been recorded from the lakes on the ice-free Byers Peninsula of Livingston Island (alongside Boeckella poppei and the benthic cladoceran Macrothrix ciliata), in Lake Wujka, and in Sombre Lake on Signy Island (alongside Boeckella poppei and the carnivorous Parabroteus sarsi). The only known fossil records of the genus Branchinecta are of B. gaini; its eggs have been found in mid to late Holocene (4,200 BP) lake deposits on James Ross Island, on the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula. B. gaini no longer occurs on James Ross Island, presumably because the lakes are unfrozen for too short a period for B. gaini to complete its life cycle. The egg cases were found to be most abundant during the Holocene climatic optimum, indicating that cyanobacterial mats must have been present in the lake then. Eggs dating from 5,500 BP have also been found on Signy Island, where the species persists. Description Branchinecta gaini can reach a total length of , making it the largest freshwater invertebrate in Antarctica. It uses its trunk limbs to scrape food from the substrate. Ecology and life cycle Branchinecta gaini feeds on epiphytes in bacterial mats, and on the mats themselves. The gut contents of B. gaini are dominated by green algae, hyphae and remains of other B. gaini individuals. They live for over six months, and produce resting eggs which can survive the winter, when the lakes are frozen. Although B. gaini often coexists with the copepod Boeckella poppei, they are rarely seen in close contact. They may be in competition for food, or B. gaini may feed on the nauplii of the copepod. B. gaini can be quite abundant, dominating the crustacean biomass in freshwater bodies in the South Orkney and South Shetland islands. The dispersal of B. gaini between lakes is probably passive, with the most likely dispersal vectors being birds; branchiopod eggs swallowed by seabirds, even if still being brooded by the mother, can survive passage through the bird's digestive system. Taxonomic history Branchinecta gaini was first described by the Hungarian biologist Eugen von Daday de Deés (also called Jenö Daday or Jenö Daday de Dées) in 1910 based on material collected from Petermann Island by the ' aboard the Pourquoi Pas ?, captained by Jean- Baptiste Charcot; the specific epithet commemorates the French algologist Louis Gain, who was responsible for preserving the specimens from that expedition.

The stream flows into the North Sea in Bridlington harbour. It is the most northerly of the Yorkshire chalk streams. The Gypsey Race rises in the Great Wold Valley through a series of springs and flows intermittently between Duggleby and West Lutton where it runs underground in the chalk aquifer before re-surfacing in Rudston.

Water from the aquifer running between West Lutton and Wold Newton also heads south to re-appear at Elmswell feeding West Beck and the River Hull. According to folklore, when the Gypsey Race is flowing in flood (The Woe Waters), bad fortune is at hand. It was in flood in the year before the great plague of 1664, the restoration of Charles II (1660) and the landing of William of Orange (1688), before the two world wars and the bad winters of 1947 and 1962.

The film is based on the novel of the same name by F. L. Green. It was shot on location in Newcastle upon Tyne and was released shortly after the outbreak of World War II. It is regarded as an early example of British film noir, with the kind of subject matter and filming style which fell completely out of favour during the war years - when British studios felt that cinemagoers would want either light entertainment and escapism or topical patriotic propaganda pieces - and would not be taken up again until the later 1940s. Film critic David Quinlan describes the film as \\"grim but gripping\\".Brit Noir Film Forum. Retrieved 19-10 2010 Andrew Spicer, in his book European Film Noir, writes: \\"A riveting psychological study.

European Film Noir. Manchester University Press, 2007, p.89 Plot Struggling Tyneside barber, Will Kobling (Richardson), is in financial trouble. One evening, opportunistically and on impulse, he steals £100 from a factory where a window has been left open. He hopes the money will represent a new start for him and wife Kit (Wynyard). His hopes are dashed when Kit confesses to being in debt to the local draper, Pilleger (Henry Oscar), who has been pressuring her to settle it. Most of the stolen cash has to go on this. Pilleger banks the money, only for the police to inform him that the serial numbers of the notes match those stolen from the factory. He professes himself an innocent party, claiming not to know which of his customers they came from, and the police have to let the matter drop. Pilleger blackmails Kobling, promising silence in return for £3 per week. Kobling is horrified at this indefinite burden, but feels obliged to consent. Some time later, and facing the loss of his business through lack of ready cash, Kobling decides to challenge Pilleger. An opportunity presents itself when a fire breaks out, distracting the police and public. He confronts Pilleger and a fight breaks out, ending in Pilleger's death. The police suspect that Kobling is involved and uses psychological tactics to break him down, but he remains grimly silent and sends Kit and their baby to stay with her sister. Kobling was seen at Pilleger's store on the night of his murder by Lizzie Crane (Mary Clare), a well-known eccentric, who talks about what she saw. The populace shun Kobling and call for justice, but the police do not believe Lizzie's word will stand up as evidence. As they continue to put pressure on him, Kobling approaches breaking point. He finally cracks when he is told that Kit has been killed in a road accident.

The headquarters, U.S. distribution center and lens technology center, Signetek, are located in San Marcos, California. Glass lenses and molds are designed and produced at Crossbows Optical, a wholly owned subsidiary located in Northern Ireland. European product distribution is achieved through two distribution centers and four optical laboratories located in England, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands. Signet Armorlite holds worldwide distribution for KODAK Lenses and is an Authorized Distributor for 3M Optical Supplies in the United States. History=1947: Dr. Robert Graham In 1947, Signet Armorlite (SA) was founded in Burbank, California, by Dr. Robert Graham shortly after the end of World War II. Armorlite pioneered plastic (CR-39) lens casting in North America. Since then, Signet Armorlite has brought to the market a wide range of lens designs and proprietary lens materials, coatings and technologies. 1993: KODAK Licensing Agreement Eastman Kodak Company issued a licensing agreement to Signet Armorlite for the exclusive right to use the KODAK brand for premium ophthalmic lenses. Since that time, over fifty ophthalmic products have been developed under the KODAK Lens brand. 2002: KODAK Precise Progressive In 2002, the award-winning KODAK Precise Progressive debuted. This new product was developed using a new patented approach to progressive design, called Vision First Design. With this technology, the traditional design methodology is actually reversed. Instead of calculating the lens surface and then measuring the results, Signet Armorlite designers start by defining the optical properties that constitute superb vision and letting those calculations determine the corresponding lens surface. The resulting smooth, continuous power increase across the entire lens provides significant improvements in visual performance, including stable peripheral vision and rapid recognition of objects in the periphery. 2006-Early 2010: Signetek In March 2006, Signetek, a division of SA, began processing SA lenses. This multimillion-dollar facility contains the newest technology for digital surfacing-to-prescription and coating application. Signetek processes all KODAK Lens and Signet Armorlite products. Among the first new products produced by Signetek is the award-winning KODAK CleAR Anti-Reflective Coating and the digitally surfaced backside progressive KODAK Unique Lens. This new lens design was created with Vision First Design and offers six corridor lengths, selected by sophisticated software based on B measurements and frame size. By November 2009, 50 lens materials are available in the KODAK Unique Lens design. Signetek produced a new generation anti-reflective coating: KODAK Clean'N'CleAR Lens. This treatment offers additional anti-static properties and a slicker top coat that takes clean lenses to a new level. Currently, KODAK CleAR Lenses are offered by Signetek and other authorized labs while KODAK Clean'N'CleAR Lenses remain exclusive to Signetek. In April 2009, Signet Armorlite once again made headway with a new major development: KODAK Lenses with Anti-Fatigue Progressive Technology. This unprecedented technology provides relief for eyestrain symptoms in presbyopes. The concept of incorporating base-in prism in a progressive design to relieve convergence insufficiency (CI) symptoms was conceived and patented by Dr. Jeffrey Krall (Mitchell, SD). An alliance was formed with SA in 2007 to make this idea a reality. In a combined effort between the Illinois College of Optometry and SA's Crossbows Facility, a double-blind study was conducted during 2008 to document the effects of base-in prism to relieve CI symptoms in a test group of presbyopes. With test results proving the concept, Crossbows engineering staff developed the patented technology offered through Signetek in KODAK Unique, Precise, Precise Short and Concise Progressive Lenses. In 2010, Signetek incorporated finishing services into its offering as well as an array of new digital products: * KODAK Precise, Precise Short and Concise Progressives with precision three-dimensional backside improvements for great visual acuity under the umbrella name of KODAK Digital Progressive Lenses. * The KODAK Unique MonitorView Lens is a backside variable-focus design for computer and near-viewing. * A full backside progressive design in two corridor lengths, DirecTek Progressive addresses the need for an economical digital lens alternative. 2010: Essilor Acquisition In April, 2010, Essilor completed the acquisition of Signet Armorlite. http://www.opticalnewsdaily.com/essilor-acquires-signet-armorlite-exclusive- manufacturer-of-kodak-lenses/ ReferencesExternal links * Category:Optics manufacturing companies ","title":"Signet Armorlite"},{"id":"29258323","text":"Amanita rubrovolvata, commonly known as the red volva Amanita, is a species of fungus in the family Amanitaceae. First described scientifically by the Japanese mycologist S. Imai in 1939, it is widely distributed in eastern Asia. The fungus produces small to medium-sized mushrooms, with reddish-orange caps up to wide. The stems are up to tall, cream above the ring and cream to yellowish below it. The stem ends in a roughly spherical bulb at the base, which is covered with bright orange patches. Neither edibility nor toxicity have been established for the fungus, but it is suspected to be associated with neurological anomalies. Several molecular studies have confirmed the mushroom's classification in the subgenus Amanita of the genus Amanita, along with closely related species such as A. muscaria. Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming The species was first described scientifically by the Japanese mycologist Sanshi Imai in 1939, based on various collections made in Japan during 1933–38. Imai designated the Japanese name for mushroom as Hime-beni- tengutake (ヒメベニテングタケ). According to the online taxonomical database MycoBank, the name Amplariella rubrovolvata, proposed by French mycologist Jean-Edouard Gilbert in 1941, is a synonym; the generic name Amplariella has since been subsumed into Amanita. Amanita rubrovolvata is classified in the subgenus Amanita of the genus Amanita, according to the systems proposed by Cornelis Bas (1969), and Rolf Singer (1986). It was one of 49 Amanita species included in a 1998 molecular phylogenetic analysis intended to help clarify natural groups and phylogenetic relationships within the genus. In the cladogram, A. rubrovolvata is on a branch next to a cluster of species including A. pantherina var. lutea, A. gemmata, A. farinosa, and A. sinensis. These results were comparable to those published in later phylogenetic analyses (1999, 2004, 2010) that have included A. rubrovolata as part of a larger dataset. The specific epithet rubrovolvata is derived from the Latin words ruber (\\"red\\"), and the adjective volvatus (\\"closely sheathed\\"). Amanita authority Rodham E. Tulloss has suggested \\"red volva Amanita\\" as an appropriate common name. Description Found in Yunnan Province, China The cap of A. rubrovolvata is wide, convex to flattened, sometimes with a slight umbo. They are dark red to reddish-orange, becoming a paler orange to yellowish at the margin. The cap surface is densely covered with red to orange to yellow, powdery to granular remnants of the volva. The cap margin is grooved—with the grooves extending to between 30% to 60% of the radius—and does not have partial veil remnants hanging along the cap margin. The flesh of the mushroom is white to yellow, or reddish immediately beneath the cap cuticle. The white gills are free from attachment to the stem and are broad. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) are truncate, and typically range in length between 15–50% of the length of the gills. The stem is by thick, roughly cylindrical or slightly larger upwards, with a surface that is cream above the ring and cream to yellowish below. The bulb at the base of the stem is roughly spherical, and wide, with its upper part covered with red, orange to yellow woolly to powdery remnants of the volva. The volva remains in mature specimens as a ring around the upper part of the stem bulb. The ring is membranous, persistent, with an upper surface that is white and a lower surface having a yellowish tinge and an edge that is red to orange. Amanita rubrovolvata produces a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5 µm. They are inamyloid, meaning that they will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14 µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4 µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia. Although the edibility or toxicity of the mushroom is not known with certainty, it has been reported to cause \\"neurological symptoms\\" in mice, as well as increased levels of blood glucose and decreased blood urea nitrogen. Other biochemical changes reported in mice, after peritoneal injection of fruit body extract, include decreases in the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase and reduced levels of liver glycogen. In these experiments, values returned to normal six hours after initial injection, suggesting that the poisoning was not serious, and did not affect liver and kidney performance. Similar species Amanita frostiana Sanmee and colleagues mention that the eastern North American species A. frostiana resembles A. rubrovoltata slightly, but the former has short grooves at the edge of a yellowish-orange cap, slightly larger spores, a yellow volva, and clamps at the basidial bases. Roger Heim reported A. frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but this was probably a misidentification of A. rubrovolvata. Habitat and distribution Amanita rubrovoltata mushrooms grow in groups on the ground. Amanita species form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The original Japanese collections were made in forests dominated by Japanese beech (Fagus crenata), but it has also been found growing near Quercus luecotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum, and Myrica esculenta in India, in Castanopsis-Schima forest in Nepal, and in Castanopsis indica plantations in the Himalayas. The species occurs in China, northern India, Nepal, Gharwal Himalaya, South Korea, and countries of Southeast Asia (for example, Thailand). The southern limit of the distribution extends to southern Malay Peninsula.

It was based on a manga of the same name by Kotomi Aoki, and it was released on 24 October 2009 in Japanese cinemas. The story revolves around Takuma Kakinouchi, a boy who is told he will die before he is 20, and Mayu Taneda, a girl who is in love with him. The film is directed by director Takehiko Shinjo, and stars newcomer actor Masaki Okada and actress Mao Inoue, who played the role of Makino Tsukushi in the television drama and film adaptation of Hana Yori Dango. The film's theme song was sung by Japanese singer Ken Hirai. Plot The film begins when Mayu and Takuma were children. They were friends since they were 8 years old. Takuma has a heart disease and he is treated by a cardiologist who happens to be Mayu's father. One day, Takuma and Mayu overhear that Takuma will not live past the age of 20 due to his condition. However, their friendship grows and Takuma becomes Mayu's first love. When they are out playing in the fields, Takuma promises to marry Mayu when they turn 20. Time passes, and Mayu and Takuma have grown up and are attending junior high school, but their love for each other remains unchanged. However, Takuma, who knows his days are numbered, wanted to push away his feelings for Mayu and distance himself from Mayu, because he cannot stand to see her cry or hurt her more than he already has. He promised to himself that after his last day in junior high, he will leave Mayu. He decided to attend an elite high school, which Takuma thinks that Mayu cannot go into. To Takuma's surprise, Mayu managed to go into that school and had actually done well enough in the school's entrance examination that she became the 1st year student body representative. She scolded Takuma in front of everyone in the school hall, when she should be making her welcome speech. She told Takuma that even if he wanted to abandon her, it will not happen in a 100,000 years. Therefore, they became known to the school as lovers. Mayu then meets Kou, who likes her and asked her to be his girlfriend. However, Mayu refuses. On the other hand, Takuma meets Teru, another patient with the same heart condition as his whom he had met in the past, and Mayu gets jealous when he spent a lot of time visiting her. Kou asked Takuma to give Mayu to him, as Takuma should spare Mayu from the pain when Takuma dies. Mayu and Takuma broke up briefly because Takuma granted Teru her wish of experiencing a kiss before she died. When Takuma visited Teru the next day, he found out that she had died. Takuma then issued Kou a challenge- they would run a 100-meter race, with the loser backing off from Mayu. Kou accepted the challenge but Takuma wins, and went to find Mayu for a date. That day, Kou went out of the school at the same time as Mayu and Takuma, and was knocked down by an oncoming train. Then, Takuma was informed that he had a suitable heart donor. Later, Mayu found out that the donor was the now brain-dead Kou, and tried to hide the fact from Takuma. However, Takuma eventually found out and refused the donation. At the same time, Kou's family saw that Kou had shed tears, and decided that there might be a miracle, and refused the donation as well. Mayu begged them many times, but they still refused to budge, although Kou had registered as a heart donor. Later, Takuma suffered a heart attack. He was rushed to hospital, and the doctor did not give him much chance of living. In his sleep, Takuma prayed that he could have just a short time more to live, and he got a miraculous recovery, and surprised Mayu. He brought Mayu on their \\"honeymoon\\", visiting many places. Finally, at the field where they first kissed, Takuma told Mayu that he was very lucky and was happy with his life, handing over his lucky- charm 'will' to her that he had written when he was eight years old.. Upon their arrival back to the hospital, Takuma suffered another heart attack and despite the best efforts of the doctor, he passed away. Mayu went to the roof and opened his letter, which told everyone to be happy when he was gone. The film ends with Mayu borrowing the urn containing Takuma's ashes, and went to a church to have a \\"wedding\\", thus fulfilling their promise when they were young. The ending scene is a flashback of the first time the 2 met at the hospital when they were 8 years old.

However, Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the Russian State Duma's Security Committee, said that the main goal of the attack may have been local, because of the low number of militants involved. Following a raid on Kadyrov's home village of Tsentoroi on 30 August, this was the second major attack since a controversial change of leadership and consequent split amongst rebels in the North Caucasus. A few months before the attack, Dokka Umarov handed over leadership of the Caucasus Emirate to the Chechen field commander Aslambek Vadalov, only to retract his resignation a few days later, causing a rift in the leadership of the group. Subsequently, the four leading field commanders in Chechnya removed themselves from Umarov's command,\\"Chechen Commanders Rebel Against Umarov\\", RFE/RL, 13 August 2010.\\"Chechen Rebel Field Commanders Renounced Loyalty Oath to Doku Umarov\\" .

Attack According to the Russian investigation, the attack began around 08:45 local time (04:45 UTC) on 19 October, when three men carrying Kalashnikov assault rifles and wearing combat and sand camouflage gear arrived in a Lada taxi at the grounds of the fenced off parliamentary complex. The militants told the driver to follow the deputies' cars, claiming to be bodyguards running late. When the taxi approached the front gate, the three jumped out and headed towards the entrance, opening fire at the two police officers manning the checkpoint as they ran. One policeman was killed and another was severely injured.Чеченские боевики прошли в парламент, Kommersant, 20 October 2010. One of the militants detonated his explosive device near the gates of the complex, while the others managed to enter the parliament building, where they opened fire and killed another policeman guarding the building as well as a parliamentary administrative manager. Six policemen and eleven civilians were wounded. A fierce firefight then ensued, in which at least two rocket- propelled grenades were discharged. Several people, mostly parliament employees, received shrapnel wounds. Meanwhile, people in the building had either escaped to the third floor or been evacuated. Following the initial attack, an operation to eliminate the rebels was launched, with President Ramzan Kadyrov personally in charge. The operation lasted 15–20 minutes. The militants broke into the unguarded parliament building but failed to get further than the ground floor, as Chechen Interior Ministry troops from the special police squad Terek entered the building through another entrance and blocked the staircase. Trapped, the militants kept shooting until they ran out of ammunition and then blew themselves up with bombs. Five Terek personnel were hospitalised. Initially it was reported that four militants were killed during the operation, citing the deputy head of the Interior Ministry of Chechnya, Roman Edilov. However, later investigators reported that three militants took part in the attack and all of them blew themselves up, the last two to avoid capture. Aftermath Only a few hours later, when all three buildings of the Chechen parliament were declared \\"cleared\\" by the special forces and explosives specialists, the meeting of deputies planned for that morning was held. It was attended by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, dressed in a parade uniform for the occasion, and by Russian Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev. According to visiting politicians from Sverdlovsk, who had actually witnessed the attack but escaped it unhurt, Kadyrov first apologised to them for what happened, and then Nurgaliyev praised the Chechen police for conducting \\"the special operation to neutralize terrorists\\" in just 15–20 minutes (eyewitnesses from his delegation and members of the investigation, however, told Kommersant that shooting continued for at least two hours). Nurgaliyev claimed, \\"An operational environment such as today's is very rare. Here, there is stability and security.\\" Kadyrov also accused the exiled Chechen nationalist leader Akhmed Zakayev and his supporters in London of organising the attack from abroad. Investigation One of the attackers, all of whose bodies were badly mutilated, was identified as Muslim Chichkanov, a 22-year-old from the Chechen village of Sernovodsk, who had been an active member of \\"an illegal armed group\\" since the end of 2009. The other two militants remained unidentified. Responsibility According to Russia Today, the Chechen Interior Ministry said it suspected a breakaway faction led by Hussein Gakayev to be responsible for the attack.\\"Probable organizer of Grozny attack named by Chechen government\\" . Russia Today, 24 October 2010. The Caucasian Knot reported that its local experts said the attack was probably organised by Gakayev, Vadalov and others who are now \\"out of Umarov's hands\\". Akhmed Zakayev denied responsibility for the attack. His assistant condemned it and said that Zakayev has \\"always spoken against this sort of actions\\". Zakayev, who previously had formally acknowledged Gakayev as Chechnya's legitimate wartime leader, disclaimed any connection with the attack, or any knowledge of who was behind it.\\"Death Toll In Grozny Parliament Attack May Have Been Far Higher\\". RFE/RL, 29 October 2010. However, Russia's General Prosecutor's Office put Zakayev back on their international wanted list.

He also blamed the UK and Poland saying they were \\"harbouring criminals. Why do they shield bandits who have shed blood where there is western democracy? Where is the justice? ... Sooner or later Zakayev, Gakayev, Umarov, Vadalov and other criminals will get what they deserve ... I have no doubt that it was the drunk and alcoholic Akhmed Zakayev and his backers in London and other western capitals. I want to say that they will not achieve anything.

Usman Ferzauli, spokesman for the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria government-in-exile (in opposition to the Caucasus Emirate), declared that they condemn the attack. Zakayev and the rest of the Ichkerian government-in-exile had already distanced themselves from the Islamists three years before the attack.\\"Statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria\\" . Chechenpress, 31 October 2007.\\"Foreign Minister Of Chechen Separatist Government Resigns\\". RFE/RL, 20 November 2007. Zakayev blames them for associating with figures which \\"spit on Chechen Independence\\", that the existence of the Caucasus emirate damaged Chechen goals of independence by weakening the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, and alleging that a member of the Caucasian Emirate government, Movladi Udugov, is an agent provocateur for Russia.Fuller, Liz.

With this book, Shin reclaimed her place as one of South Korea’s most prominent writers, achieving both critical acclaim and commercial success. The novel tracks down the mother’s life of self-sacrifice, which coincided with South Korea’s dramatic shift from a pre-modern to post-modern society, and in the course has restored a place for motherhood in the South Korean psyche. Foreign rights to Please Look After Mom were sold in 19 countries. *Yi Jin (2007) *Violet (2001) *The Train Departs at Seven (1999) *A Lone Room (1995) Shin was awarded the Manhae Literary Prize for the book in 1996. A Lone Room has been translated and published in France, Germany, Japan and China, and it was translated into English with funding from the American PEN Center. In 2009 the book was awarded the Prix de l’Inapercu in France. *Deep Sorrow (1994) Shin’s first novel is a tale of unrequited love between three childhood friends—Eun-seo, Wan and Se—whose lives continue to intercept as they face new challenges in the unfamiliar terrain of adulthood. As the three friends move on from their utopian rural hometown to the big, brutal cities, their hopes and disappointments collide, bringing them together or sometimes pushing them apart. The rapture of love offers shelter, but never for long, for love cannot be shared equally amongst the three of them.

IQWiG also supplies health information to patients and the general public. The organization is independent of the pharmaceutical industry, contracted solely by the Federal Ministry of Health and the Joint Federal Committee.  Structure  IQWiG was founded in 2004 under the directorship of Dr Peter Sawicki, who was replaced in September 2010 by Dr Jürgen Windeler. Its deputy director is Dr Stefan Lange. IQWiG is divided into the following departments, which publish reports: * Drug Assessment * Non-Drug Interventions * Quality of Health Care * Medical Biometry * Health Economics General health information, written in plain language, is additionally produced by a Health Information department. These departments are also supported by Administration and Communication departments. It regularly communicates with similar organisations in other countries, such as with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK and the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) in France.  Most noticed reports  IQWiG hit international headlines in October 2010 with a report slamming Reboxetine as inefficient and harmful. Similarly, in September 2010, another study rebuffed the use of Venlafaxine and Duloxetine as first-line treatment in major depression, but recommend them as a second line option.
