In a poll conducted in 22 countries for the BBC World Service in July and August 2008, those in all 22 countries preferred Obama. The margin in favor of Obama ranged from 9% in India to 82% in Kenya. On average, 49% of respondents preferred Barack Obama and 12% preferred John McCain, while nearly 40% expressed no preference. Media reaction Media around the world reacted with strong emotions when Obama was elected. Most expressed positive hopes and expectations for the president-elect, but some tried to prepare their readers for disappointment. Editorials varied from elation to cautious optimism, and a few were outright skeptical. Many celebrated Obama's victory as historic and a sign of changing race-relations in America. Commentators said the election results surprised them because there was an international perception that America was too racist to elect a black president. Many also said people in their country were blinded by infatuation with Obama and encouraged them to see him as a normal human being capable of error. Within a week, the excitement and elation subsided somewhat and newspaper editorials began to caution that Obama had enormous obstacles ahead. The election was closely watched from around the world and domestic media like CNN and PBS tracked the international reaction. Major newspapers on every continent covered the election's outcome on their front pages or as their top story, a reflection of the U.S.'s strong influence on world affairs and candidate Obama's international celebrity. Obama's campaign had said it would like to \\"build a fan base across the world.\\" See also * References External links Category:2008 in international relations Category:Foreign relations of the United States Category:International reactions to elections Category:Reactions to 2000s events Category:2008 United States presidential election ","title":"International reactions to the 2008 United States presidential election"},{"id":"20084219","text":"Customer Communications Management (CCM) is software that enables companies to manage customer communications across a wide range of media. Originally, customer communications referred to printed documents, archived digital documents, email and web pages. It has grown to include SMS/MMS, in-app notifications, responsive design mobile experiences and messages over common social media platforms. Gartner IT Glossary It entails an automated process that involves not only the delivery of communication but also the segmentation of messages according to different customer profiles and contexts.  Concept  CCM software allows organizations to deploy a new approach to information exchange thereby improving their ability to maintain relationships with customers and other stakeholders. By using the software, messages disseminated are no longer generic but tailored according to customers' needs and specific platforms (Web, email, SMS, print) and devices (mobile, laptop, tablet, PC). For instance, if a customer interacts with an organization, the data or push messages provided cover not only the needed information but the entire context of the interaction which includes customer profile (e.g. lifestyle and life- stage needs), history of online activity, and personal preferences. This process involves the utilization of high-volume data collected offline and online. Owing to the nature of CCMs, they are also referred to as \\"Intelligent Customer Communications Management\\" systems. History Before the term CCM was used, this technology was referred to as Variable Data Printing (VDP)or Variable Data Publishing. The term TransPromo, short for Transpromotional was in use as the term VDP gave way to CCM in industry generated content. Some Initial CCM concepts were focused upon the utilisation of company transactional documents. These documents such as bank statements, statement of account, invoices and other customer transactional documents were viewed as ideal media to promote company products to customers. The rationale behind this was cited in analyst research by InfoTrends that, \\"transactional documents are opened and read by more than 90% of consumers. Because the average consumer is bombarded with advertising, e-mail, direct mail and other forms of solicitation each day, TransPromo can help you cut through the clutter and stand out\\". Other CCM concepts were shaped by marketing needs, and many CCM technologies improved design, testing, analytic integration, customer journey mapping capabilities to meet the needs of marketers, who became increasingly important in the technology buying process.https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/8-top-findings- in-gartner-cmo-spend-survey-2018-19 The scope of CCM solutions has rapidly grown beyond management and data analysis. Many contemporary solutions offer \\"automatic generation of sales proposals, employment contracts, loan documents, service level agreements, product descriptions and pricing, and other transactional or legal documents where re-usable content can be applied to generate accurate, consistent and personalised documents for a range of business applications\\". Document Boss. (2012). CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS ‚Äì the new frontier for dynamic document management. Retrieved from www.documentboss.com This shift into management flexibility becomes more evident as companies develop CCM solutions and products adaptable to evolving technologies available to businesses. In the recent years, this can be observed with businesses' introduction of tablets and tablet-friendly solutions into their standard scope of work. New Zealand Herald. (2002). Tablet ActiveDocs to be released. Retrieved from www.nzherald.co.nz Components The technology that supports customer communications management also allows sophistication in the content of the messages. Customer communications management technology usually includes or integrates with the following components: # Data Extraction, Transform & Load software # Data Management, Analysis and Location Intelligence software # Data Hygiene database software # Document composition software # Electronic document archive software and perhaps payment processing functionality # Print Stream Engineering / Post Processing Software # Mailing compliance database software # Printer Management Software # High and medium volume production printers # Envelope inserter machines # Email Marketing Software # SMS Communication Software # Mobile Media based content distribution software # Entering the frame more recently social media distribution software # Document Production Reporting Software # Portal Technology # Transpromotional Application software # Customer Journey Mapping # Customer Journey Orchestration All CCM technologies feature design interfaces that primarily use a visual layout software to define the structure of the communication. These design interfaces create a basic visual structure of a communication that is later populated by a production engine with data, variably created data, static content elements, rules-driven content elements, externally referenced content and other elements to create a finished customer communication. There are varying degrees of sophistication that CCM design interfaces handle, depending on the business needs. Some design environments are simple cloud-based interfaces that create communications for quick and easy marketing communications. There are more comprehensive interfaces that can support complex applications like insurance policy generation that require the skills and expertise of many business experts. Most CCM technologies offer data extraction capabilities that present marketers and businesses with an opportunity to combine data from multiple systems across their business to perform customer analysis before composing communications. This allows marketers to evaluate the marketing mix and position individual products to the customer in respect of relevance to the customer or the results of purchase propensity model by applying rules on content elements within the design. The process results in the creation of a data model, data acquisition and decision rules. These enable a document composition engine to follow its own set of document application rules, constructing individual documents on the basis of data items contained within an individual's data record. The Document Composition engine usually produces either a print stream or, XML data. Post processing can be utilised to prepare a print job for production and distribution. This may include tasks such as the application of barcodes to deliver individual mail piece instructions to the inserters and to vary these in terms of the actual inserter being used. For example, one manufacturer‚Äôs inserter may require different barcode instructions to complete the same task than another. Print Management software controls the routing and distribution of print jobs to either a single production printer or a fleet of production printers. Print management software also provides a mechanism for assured delivery (ensuring that all pages get printed) through communication and feedback from print devices. Analysis of resultant data provides insight useful for Document Production Managers. Relevance of communication is seen as key in overcrowded, competitive markets where service differentiation can be difficult. Documents that add value to the customer relationship are a major factor in improving customer retention and acquisition. Employing a Customer Communications Management solution can help organizations improve all these customer experiences efforts on a multi-channel communications level.

The acronym CEDO comes from the Spanish name: Centro Intercultural de Estudios de Desiertos y Oc√©anos. Located in Puerto Pe√±asco, Sonora, Mexico, CEDO is a center for the study of the ecosystems of the Sonoran Desert and the Gulf of California. History In 1975, CEDO's current Executive Director Peggy Turk Boyer visited Puerto Pe√±asco with professors John Hendrickson and Don Thomson of the University of Arizona's Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) Department, as part of the UA's thriving marine biology program. They and their students conducted field activities out of a small beach house beside an experimental shrimp mariculture enterprise which was operated jointly by the UA's Environmental Research Lab (ERL) and the Centro de Investigaci√≥n en Ciencia y Tecnolog√≠a of the Universidad de Sonora (CICTUS). Carl Hodges, ERL's first director and founder of the affiliated nonprofit Desert Development Foundation (DDF), and CICTUS director, Xico Murrieta envisioned a new organization called the Institute for Deserts and Oceans (IDO). It would operate out of a new facility located in the Las Conchas housing development east of the shrimp labs and would be supported with profits from the shrimp mariculture commercial enterprise. Nicholas Yensen was hired as the first director in 1978. After a successful fundraising campaign, Yensen was able to convert the unfinished Las Conchas recreation center and office building into a simple functional biological field station. Conservation and research CEDO is a collaboration between Mexican and US non profit organisations and its mission is to advance and share knowledge about the Northern Gulf of California and the surrounding Sonoran Desert. CEDO also promotes the conservation and sustainable use of natural and cultural resources. This includes sustainable fisheries, coastal conservation, wetland research, community education and monthly climatological reports on Puerto Pe√±asco. Awards In 2007, CEDO won Mexico's National Conservation of Nature Award for their 27-year effort to protect the Gulf of California. CEDO received the 2010 Human Diversity Award from the Organization of Biological Field Stations in Michigan for its achievements in creating collaborative, inclusive systems with local communities and businesses which allowed sustainable fishing and other commercial developments in the Northern Gulf of California.

It is an adaptation of less known novel of the same name by Feri Lain≈°ƒçek. The film is the most acclaimed and most successful Slovenian films of all times, and also the third most successful movie in Slovenia, following Titanic and Troy. Plot The film takes place in the Mura Valley, in the vicinity of Gornja Radgona. David Slavinec, nicknamed ƒêuro (Primo≈æ Bezjak) has recently been laid off from his job. However, his former boss points him to a new job at the automechanic shop owned by his acquaintance Pi≈°ti Gaja≈° (Vlado Novak), which he gladly accepts. Gaja≈° is an experienced, but somewhat naive local car mechanic who frequently talks about the past times when, in his opinion, life was much better for the ordinary people. His friends frequently visit him to play cards and discuss the events happening around them. Cveto Vuksanoviƒá - Lepec, (Dario Varga) the town's biggest thug and the owner of the local night club, frequently visits Gaja≈° to repair his Mercedes. Gaja≈° always repairs the car for him although Lepec always finds an excuse not to pay the bill immediately, preferring payments in various small favors to Gaja≈° and his friends. One day, ƒêuro meets Bronja, (Pia Zemljiƒç), the wife of Lepec who brings in her car for repair. One day she asks ƒêuro to drive her to Austria to get some pills for her friend. They soon start meeting each other. On one occasion she tells ƒêuro that she and her husband have become estranged after the birth of their daughter and the pills were meant to cure her severe nervous breakdown. ƒêuro and Bronja start a passionate affair, which Gaja≈° discovers, but keeps hidden from Lepec, who nevertheless becomes suspicious when he finds the lighter forgotten by ƒêuro in their bedroom. In the meantime, Gaja≈° dreams about Severina, a well-known Croatian pop star, who is on tour in the town. When Lepec drives his car in for a repair again, Gaja≈° demands he pays the debts from the past. This time Lepec pays him some money and gives a promise he will bring Severina to his place to have a dinner with him. Late that evening, Severina comes and joins Gaja≈° at the dinner. The next morning Gaja≈° joyfully tells ƒêuro that he had \\"rooster's breakfast\\" (i.e. morning sex) with Severina, but ƒêuro tells him that the girl he slept with wasn't the real Severina, but a lookalike prostitute. Soon Lepec appears and spots a necklace given to ƒêuro by Bronja, thus discovering their affair. After a quarrel with Lepec, Gaja≈° pulls out the gun and shoots Lepec before he can strike ƒêuro. Some time later, ƒêuro visits Gaja≈° in prison who orders him to take over his workshop and to maintain it in such order as did he. He then settles there with Bronja and her daughter.

It is located at the foot of The Moor (a pedestrianised shopping street), close to the Sheffield Inner Ring Road. Before its construction, The Moor continued across St Mary's Gate onto London Road. The building opened in July 1981.Flickr:Going soon? The building is based around three wings; the East Wing, the West Wing & the North Wing, and floors were originally numbered in the US style with the ground floor as Floor 1 or First Floor. Amongst the facilities originally constructed in the building was a staff restaurant and bar on Floor 2 and a full sized squash court in the basement. As the construction of the building across The Moor effectively severed the traditional access to The Moor from London Road, to satisfy planning conditions, Moorfoot was designed to allow pedestrian access 'through' the building. The pedestrian walkway began with an elevated ramp near the corner of Young Street and South Lane, before proceeding via a tunnel through the building (including a section with a glazed roof as the route crossed the base of an open area in the East Wing. The walkway exited the building above the car park and used sloping ramps to bring the route back to ground level on The Moor near the Entrance to the building. The route was dependent on the completion of a further planned development (where the Premier Inn hotel is currently located) and as this development did not take place, the route was never completed or opened to the public. The building was previously known as the Manpower Services Commission Building and was the headquarters of that agency. It later contained offices belonging to several departments of the British Government, namely: *Training Commission *Training Agency *Department of Employment *Department for Children, Schools and Families *Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills *Department for Work and Pensions *Home Office The building was purchased by Sheffield City Council in the late 2000s with the government departments as sitting tenants pending their relocation. In 2010 the British Government vacated the property, and were replaced by the council's Children, Young Peoples and Families Directorate and Central Finance Service. It was planned that the building would eventually be demolished and the site form part of a new business district. However, in the summer of 2011, many departments from Sheffield Town Hall moved into the Moorfoot Building. In January 2013 Henry Boot Construction announced the award of a contract to refurbish a large part of the building for Sheffield City Council. The multimillion-pound project was to deliver vital services upgrades and a refurbishment to the majority of the building in order to provide office space for SCC employees.

He was born on 10 February 1932 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany as Werner Dietrich Langbein and died on 25 June 2004 in Bad Homburg, Germany. He was married and had a son and two daughters.  Early days  In 1951 Dieter Langbein started his studies in mathematics at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t at Frankfurt am Main, where he met Prof. Friedrich Hund who inspired him to work in theoretical physics. After his diploma in physics in 1956 and his thesis on solid state physics in 1958 he went to the Institute of Theoretical Physics at G√∂ttingen to work with Prof. Hund in investigating galvanomagnetic effects.  Research  In 1962 he joined Farbwerke Hoechst AG where he worked on thermodynamics and reaction kinetics. Dieter Langbein's scientific career was characterized by working closely with experimental physicists as well as with chemists and biologists. He achieved this by joining Battelle-Institut e.V., Frankfurt am Main in 1964. His work on the splitting of the electronic band structure in magnetic fields together with E. Gerlach E. Gerlach and D. Langbein, Phys. Rev. 145, 449 - 457 (1966) led to a guest professorship at James Frank Institute, University of Chicago, Illinois in 1967/1968 followed by a stay at the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio. His research led to the later Hofstadter's butterfly of the electron's energy bands structure. In 1969 he receives the venia legendi for physics at Frankfurt University and in 1972 he becomes Honorary Professor. Back at Battelle- Institute Frankfurt he turned to the field of Van der Waals force. After a Visiting Fellowship at the University of Canberra, Australia he published in 1974 his book Theory of Van der Waals attraction. Around 1976 he learned about the fascination of research under microgravity conditions. He set up a table of about a dozen effects contributing to the separation of monotectic alloys during solidification observed in rocket experiments. His microgravity experiments with transparent liquids proved the importance of the Marangoni effect. He became a member of the managing committee of ELGRA (European Low Gravity Research Association) in 1978, chairman of the German consulting group on fluid physics under low gravity and was scientific consultant at ESA, NASA and JAMIC. Together with the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, he 1985 established The Microgravity Research Experiments (MICREX) Database, for which he was the principal investigator.

The nave and chancel were rebuilt in 1828. The church was added to the National Heritage List for England in 1954 at grade II, the lowest of three grades for listed buildings. St Bridget The medieval church, is believed to be dedicated to the Swedish St Bridget, who was canonised in 1391. Research by the Penwith History Group has found that the earliest reference to Bridget ‚Ä≥of Sweden‚Ä≥ is an April 1928 article in The Cornishman newspaper by Canon Jennings, the vicar of Madron with Morvah and repeated by Walter Frere, the Bishop of Truro on the centenary of the rebuilding of the church in August 1928. A chapel of St Bridget, probably at Morvah, was mentioned in 1390, a year before St Bridget of Sweden (died 1371) was canonised. There is a pattern of churches along the coast being dedicated to Irish saints and it is likely that the St Bridget at Morvah refers to an Irish saint. One such saint is Brigid of Kildare who died in 525 and named after a pagan Irish goddess who seemed to be an important figure in the Celtic church. Further evidence for an Irish connection was the feast of Lughnasa (now Lammas), an Irish pagan festival held on the first Sunday in August until the mid 1800s. The then vicar described it as an event attended ‚Ä≥by disorderly persons of every description‚Ä≥. The dedication is sometimes given as St Morwetha. Morvah was in early times a chapelry dependent on Madron.

Born in Greenock, Scotland, Boyle arrived in Canada from Scotland in 1856 and apprenticed to a blacksmith. He would become a teacher in rural Ontario in 1865, a school principal in Elora 1871-1881, and later a bookseller in Toronto. Boyle followed what were then \\"radical child-centered theories\\"Killan, Gerald. \\"Boyle, David\\" in The Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig Publishers, 1988), Volume 1, p.264. of Johann Pestalozzi. In 1884, Boyle became curator of the Canadian Institute Museum, a post he held until 1896, and was curator of the Ontario Provincial Museum 1886-1911. He cultivated a core of loyal collectors across southern and central Ontario who assisted him in archaeological digs and in collecting artifacts for the museums. These men included Andrew Frederick Hunter, George E. Laidlaw, J. Hugh Hammond, John Long, Dr Thomas W. Beeman, William Wintemberg and Frederick William Waugh. He was also the Secretary of the Ontario Historical Society after 1898, and became highly influential in the local historical societies that grew up in Ontario in the late nineteenth century. In 1898, Boyle also began to conduct ethnographic fieldwork at the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve near Brantford, after having met John Ojijatekha Brant-Sero through the Canadian Institute. He later met Dr. Peter E. Jones of the nearby Mississauga of the New Credit reserve who also assisted him in his fieldwork.Hamilton, Michelle A.

An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate David Boyle's role in Ontario's heritage. His work served as the basis for archaeology as a serious scientific discipline in the province. Between 1887 and 1911, he published Annual Archaeological Reports for Ontario, Canada's first journal primarily dedicated to archaeology. In 1908 he was the third recipient of the Cornplanter Medal. Boyle was also a history buff and preservationist, as well as the author of a book of nonsense poetry for children. He died in 1911 in Toronto after a serious stroke. His papers are housed at the provincial Archives of Ontario, the University of Toronto Archives, and at the Royal Ontario Museum archives.

It was later released in North America by DreamCatcher Interactive. Egypt was a commercial hit, with sales of 550,000 units in Europe alone by December 2000. Gameplay  Synopsis  Ramos√©, a young Theban, is on a mission to exonerate his father, who has been accused of pillaging the tomb of Seti I. In the vault at dawn, he unveils a stone showing a map of the tomb and a monkey, hinting to Hori, a former draughtsman. Ramos√© then sets off to the village of Deir el-Medina where he finds Hori lying dead in his cellar, along with clues alluding to a carpenter bound for the embalmers' workshop, where he discovers a wider plot the next day. He skillfully manages to pass for one of the conspirators and is led to a tomb where a burial is being held. Ramos√© descends to the funerary chamber. He is immured but manages to escape via a tunnel which leads him to the site of a tomb in construction of another noble, Pan√©hesy, where a mourner awaits him. She leads him to the villa of the noble, who has organized a large festivity. Passing for one of the guests, he finds a map of the Festival Hall of Thutmose III in Karnak.

Development  Serious Games and Edutainment Applications suggests that the 1997 video game Versailles 1685, a pioneer in the \\"cultural entertainment\\" genre that merged entertainment with cultural education, paved the way for games such as Egypt. Reception Egypt was a commercial success. French newspaper Les √âchos reported its sales at 250,000 units by November 1998, and noted that it was among 1997's 10 best- selling computer games. According to Cryo Interactive, it sold above 500,000 copies by November 2000. Marketing manager Mattieu Saint-Dennis explained in December that Egypts sales totaled 550,000 units in Europe alone, of which France accounted for 200,000 units. By February 2004, Egypt and its sequel, Egypt II, had achieved combined global sales above 700,000 units.

In 2010, Micro√Øds released an adaptation of the game, split into parts, for the Apple iPhone. Gameplay Plot Development Following the 2002 bankruptcy and liquidation of Cryo Interactive, many of its key assets were purchased by DreamCatcher Interactive to form that company's new European branch. Two development teams, including the one behind Cryo's Egypt series, were among these acquisitions. DreamCatcher subsequently revealed Egypt III in April 2003, under the name The Egyptian Prophecy in North America and Egypt III: The Fate of Ramses in Europe. It was among a slew of announcements by the company in preparation for the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). Initially, Egypt III was developed internally by DreamCatcher Europe. However, in summer 2003, DreamCatcher Europe shuttered the game development divisions it had carried over from Cryo. Adventure Gamers later noted that Egypt III \\"seemed destined for cancellation\\".https://adventuregamers.com/articles/view/17997 A group of those laid off from DreamCatcher Europe, led by Beno√Æt Hozjan, proceeded to found the independent developer Kheops Studio. According to Hozjan, most of the team had already been involved in Egypt III before its development was interrupted, and Kheops received a contract from DreamCatcher to complete the game. Jeux Video reported that Egypt III had \\"quietly resumed development\\" and was nearing completion by January 2004. As Cryo had done for Egypt II, Kheops worked with archeologist Jean-Claude Golvin to increase historical accuracy. However, unlike its predecessors, it was not created in collaboration with the R√©union des Mus√©es Nationaux. Egypt III was targeted primarily at casual gamers.  Reception  Andrew Plotkin of Zarf thought the game contained a thin story backed by copious amounts of educational historical information. Slydos of Adventure-Archiv thought it was entertaining, though not innovative. GameBoomers praised it for not being too long or difficult; mainstays of the genre. Tap-Repeatedly reviewer Toger deemed the game a \\"nice little diversion\\". WorthPlaying recommended the game to Myst fans. Steve Ramsey of Quandary noted that the player doesn't need to have played the game's prequels in order to understand the plot. Dan Ravipinto of Adventure Gamers criticised the game's cluttered environments and slow interface. Jeux Video thought the short and easy game would offer a pleasant Egyptian adventure for the player. Game Chronicles thought the game would only receive acclaim or interest from fans of the adventure game genre.

It was started in 1909 as the press organ of the Labour Party in Hedemarken and its adjoining regions, and was called Demokraten (\\"The Democrat\\") until 1923. It was issued three days a week between 1909 and 1913, six days a week in 1914, three days a week again between 1914 and 1918 before again increasing to six days a week. It was renamed to Arbeideren in 1923, and in the same year it was taken over by the Norwegian Communist Party. The Communist Party incorporated the newspaper Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad into Arbeideren in 1924, and until 1929 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad. After Arbeideren had gone defunct, the name was used by the Communist Party for other newspapers elsewhere. The chief editors of the newspaper were Olav Kringen (1909‚Äì1913), Ole Holmen (1912‚Äì1913), Fredrik Monsen (1913‚Äì1916), Paul O. L√∏kke (1916‚Äì1919), Alfred Aakermann (1919‚Äì1920), Olav Larssen (1920‚Äì1927), and finally Trond Hegna, Ingvald B. Jacobsen, Olav Scheflo, Eivind Petershagen, and J√∏rgen Vogt (between 1927 and 1929). Fredrik Monsen, Evald O. Solbakken and Knut Olai Thorn√¶s were acting editors from 1924 to 1925. Pre-history Demokraten was originally the name of a short-lived newspaper in Hamar started by Leopold Rasmussen in 1852, connected to the Marcus Thrane movement. Rasmussen started a second newspaper, Oplands-Posten, in Hamar later in 1852, to compete with his own Demokraten. An organ for the social liberal labour movement in the district, Arbeiderbladet existed from 1889 to 1892 and was published out of different cities, including in Hamar in the year 1890. A countywide chapter of the Labour Party was established in Hedmark in mid-November 1904. After the countywide party convention in Stange in 1906, the convention summary had to be printed in the Kristiania-based newspaper Social-Demokraten, as it lacked its own local newspaper. The county board thus decided to buy 1,500 copies of the Social-Demokraten to distribute to its members. There was a growing notion that the party needed its own newspaper. In the same year, the labour movement in Sol√∏r (south of Hedmark) bought the paper Solungen, which had existed since 1904. The takeover came into effect on 1 January 1907, and publishing began the following year. Solungen pretended to be the labour movement organ for the whole of Hedmark, and outside of Sol√∏r it was published as Hedemarkens Amts Socialdemokrat (Solungen). However, the rest of Hedmark county was not satisfied with this solution. Labour Party period =1909‚Äì1913= An approximate map where Hedemarken is shown in blue, northern √òsterdalen in red and southern √òsterdalen in yellow. The Hamar-based newspaper Demokraten (\\"The Democrat\\") was started on 15 September 1909. The initiator and first editor was Olav Kringen, who had ample experience as the editor of Social-Demokraten from 1903 until 1906. Demokraten was the Labour Party organ for the Mj√∏sa Cities and Hedemarken, but in its first years it also covered Gudbrandsdalen and √òsterdalen, two northern regions. The name √òstoplandenes Socialistiske Partiblad was considered for the newspaper, but the historical name Demokraten prevailed. The name was suggested by local Labour MP Karl Amundsen. Demokraten's coverage of Gudbrandsdalen soon ended, and in southern √òsterdalen a new labour newspaper, √òsterdalens Arbeiderblad, was set up in 1915. In northern √òsterdalen, Arbeidets Rett was popular among the labour movement. According to reports in Demokraten the newspaper again began to cover news from a part of Gudbrandsdalen, namely the city Lillehammer, in 1912. When it came to building up a new newspaper, Kringen had a certain personal drive, as he ran for parliament in 1909. When he lost the election, he also lost interest to a certain degree. He resigned in 1912 and Ole Holmen, a member of the Vang municipal council, took over as chief editor. However, he ran afoul of other people involved with the newspaper and was fired in 1913. Title, November 1913. The newspaper originally had the tagline (\\"Socialist Paper for Oplandene\\"), but in 1910 this was changed to (\\"Spokesman for the Labour Movement\\"). It was printed by the company A. S√¶ther. The newspaper was issued three times a week until 1 July 1913, from which point it was increased to six times a week. As part of this ambitious increase, Demokraten also had 3,000 copies in circulation, unprecedented in its history. =1913‚Äì1916= In 1913 the newspaper's supervisory council hired school teacher Fredrik Monsen to be the new editor. Olav Larssen started his journalist career as a subeditor in the same year. In the newspaper's supervisory council vote, Monsen edged out Waldemar Carlsen with 22 to 4 votes, and also prevailed over other applicants who were seasoned editors, such as Ingvald F√∏rre and Eug√®ne Olaussen. Larssen prevailed over Carlsen and F√∏rre in the vote for the new subeditor. Only Monsen and Larssen were employed in the newspaper to work with editorial content. In 1913, Monsen managed to contract known personalities from the labour movement as \\"regular contributors\\". These were the nationally known figures Olav Kringen, Gunnar Ousland and Johan Falkberget, in addition to Lillehammer politician Petter Nilssen and the locally known politicians Arne Juland (later MP) and Andr. Juell. Danish expatriate Alfred Kruse joined in the autumn of 1913. However, according to Larssen, the prominent writers contracted to Demokraten \\"seldomly wrote\\" anything. In his memoirs, Larssen wrote that Monsen was \\"often aggressive\\" as editor-in-chief, especially when writing editorials. He got several adversaries in the city's conservative community, especially after donning a badge with the broken rifle, a well- known anti-war symbol. The newspaper competed with the old and popular conservative Hamar Stiftstidende, the liberal left Oplandenes Avis, and the liberal Oplandet. The practice of issuing the newspaper six days a week became harder after the outbreak of the First World War. The war caused a general rise in prices, and newspaper subscriptions and advertisements both declined. Demokraten had to revert to being issued three times a week starting 1 September 1914. In December 1914 it adopted a new tagline, (\\"Organ for the Labour Party in Hamar and the Hamlets of Hedemarken\\"). =1916‚Äì1923= Monsen and Larssen both left Demokraten in 1916. The next editors were Paul O. L√∏kke, who served from 1916 to 1919, and Alfred Aakermann, from 1919 to 1920. Larssen returned in 1920 as editor-in-chief. Georg Svendsen was the subeditor from 1918 until 1921, when Evald O. Solbakken started in the newspaper as subeditor. Still, there were only two people to deliver the editorial content. As the war years went, the newspaper's finances gradually improved. The Norwegian state became more active in production and trade and contributed many advertisements. Demokraten acquired its own type-setting machine in October 1918 and a printing press in 1917, which it used from 1 January 1918. From 1 July 1918, circulation once again increased to six days a week. Communist Party period In 1923, the newspaper was renamed Arbeideren (\\"The Worker\\"), and the first issue with this name was released on 1 May 1923, the International Workers' Day. The change followed a letter in 1922 from the Comintern Executive, which stated that no newspaper belonging to a Comintern member organization should have \\"Social Democrat\\" or \\"Democrat\\" as a part of its title. The printing press of the party changed its name accordingly, to Arbeiderens trykkeri. Logo of Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad. In the same year, 1923, the Labour Party broke out of the Comintern. Subsequently the Communist Party broke away from the Labour Party. The local chapter of the Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with the Communist Party in November 1923, in a 123‚Äì22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the supervisory council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the Communist Party had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad. Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both joined the Communist Party in 1923 and continued running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen was asked by the party to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924‚Äì1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thorn√¶s were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of the Communist Party. In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that the Communist Party should contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party. A local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left the Communist Party, and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the party at the same time. Information differs as to who replaced Larssen. According to Evald Solbakken, and also to the reference bibliography Norske aviser 1763‚Äì1969, the replacement was Olav Scheflo, who needed a stand- in, Ingvald B. Jacobsen, for the first period. According to the encyclopaedia Arbeidernes Leksikon and historian Einhart Lorenz, Trond Hegna was the editor in 1927, before he took over Norges Kommunistblad in the summer of 1927. Hegna's main job was to edit the periodical Mot Dag, but in this period the people of Mot Dag had an informal influence on the Communist Party and several of their newspapers. Scheflo formally edited the newspaper from 1927 to 1928, with Eivind Petershagen as acting editor from late 1927. In 1928 Petershagen formally took over, only to have J√∏rgen Vogt become acting editor later that year. Vogt took over in 1929. As many newspapers belonging to the dwindling Communist Party, Arbeideren would cease to exist before the end of the 1920s. It was still published six times a week, but had to give up its printing press in 1929, switching to Samtrykk in Oslo. The last ever issue of Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad was published on 4 October 1929. Aftermath A month after Arbeideren went defunct, the Communist Party gave its name to a new newspaper, which was set up as the new main newspaper of the Communist Party in 1930. This new paper was based in Oslo as the replacement of Norges Kommunistblad, which had been liquidated as well. Olav Larssen and Evald Solbakken found a new outlet in Hamar Arbeiderblad, which had been set up as the new Hamar organ of the Labour Party in 1925. The Communist Party later tried to create a weekly newspaper in Hamar, R√∏d Front, but it was short-lived and existed only between 1932 and 1933. The Oslo version of Arbeideren went defunct in 1940, and many years after that, the name was used from 1951 to 1953 for a third newspaper, published in Brumunddal, not far from Hamar city.

The third variable is referred to as the moderator variable or simply the moderator. The effect of a moderating variable is characterized statistically as an interaction; that is, a categorical (e.g., sex, ethnicity, class) or quantitative (e.g., level of reward) variable that affects the direction and/or strength of the relation between dependent and independent variables. Specifically within a correlational analysis framework, a moderator is a third variable that affects the zero-order correlation between two other variables, or the value of the slope of the dependent variable on the independent variable. In analysis of variance (ANOVA) terms, a basic moderator effect can be represented as an interaction between a focal independent variable and a factor that specifies the appropriate conditions for its operation.Baron, R. M., & Kenny, D. A. (1986). \\"The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations\\", Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5 (6), 1173‚Äì1182 (page 1174) Example Conceptual diagram of a simple moderation model in which the effect of the focal antecedent (X) on the outcome (Y) is influenced or dependent on a moderator (W). A statistical diagram of a simple moderation model. Moderation analysis in the behavioral sciences involves the use of linear multiple regression analysis or causal modelling. To quantify the effect of a moderating variable in multiple regression analyses, regressing random variable Y on X, an additional term is added to the model. This term is the interaction between X and the proposed moderating variable. Thus, for a response Y and two variables x1 and moderating variable x2,: :Y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3(x_1\\\\times x_2) + \\\\varepsilon \\\\, In this case, the role of x2 as a moderating variable is accomplished by evaluating b3, the parameter estimate for the interaction term. See linear regression for discussion of statistical evaluation of parameter estimates in regression analyses.  Multicollinearity in moderated regression  In moderated regression analysis, a new interaction predictor (x_1x_2) is calculated. However, the new interaction term will be correlated with the two main effects terms used to calculate it. This is the problem of multicollinearity in moderated regression. Multicollinearity tends to cause coefficients to be estimated with higher standard errors and hence greater uncertainty. Mean-centering (subtracting raw scores from the mean) has been suggested as a remedy for multicollinearity. However, mean-centering is unnecessary in any regression analysis, as one uses a correlation matrix and the data are already centered after calculating correlations. Correlations are derived from the cross- product of two standard scores (Z-scores) or statistical moments (hence the name: Pearson Product-Moment Correlation). Also see the article by Kromrey & Foster-Johnson (1998) on \\"Mean-centering in Moderated Regression: Much Ado About Nothing\\".  Post-hoc probing of interactions  Like simple main effect analysis in ANOVA, in post-hoc probing of interactions in regression, we are examining the simple slope of one independent variable at the specific values of the other independent variable. Below is an example of probing two-way interactions. In what follows the regression equation with two variables A and B and an interaction term A*B, :Y = b_0 + b_1A + b_2B + b_3A*B + \\\\varepsilon will be considered. = Two categorical independent variables = If both of the independent variables are categorical variables, we can analyze the results of the regression for one independent variable at a specific level of the other independent variable. For example, suppose that both A and B are single dummy coded (0,1) variables, and that A represents ethnicity (0 = European Americans, 1 = East Asians) and B represents the condition in the study (0 = control, 1 = experimental). Then the interaction effect shows whether the effect of condition on the dependent variable Y is different for European Americans and East Asians and whether the effect of ethnic status is different for the two conditions. The coefficient of A shows the ethnicity effect on Y for the control condition, while the coefficient of B shows the effect of imposing the experimental condition for European American participants. To probe if there is any significant difference between European Americans and East Asians in the experimental condition, we can simply run the analysis with the condition variable reverse-coded (0 = experimental, 1 = control), so that the coefficient for ethnicity represents the ethnicity effect on Y in the experimental condition. In a similar vein, if we want to see whether the treatment has an effect for East Asian participants, we can reverse code the ethnicity variable (0 = East Asians, 1 = European Americans). = One categorical and one continuous independent variable = A statistical diagram that depicts a moderation model with X as a multicategorical independent variable. If the first independent variable is a categorical variable (e.g. gender) and the second is a continuous variable (e.g. scores on the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)), then b1 represents the difference in the dependent variable between males and females when life satisfaction is zero. However, a zero score on the Satisfaction With Life Scale is meaningless as the range of the score is from 7 to 35. This is where centering comes in. If we subtract the mean of the SWLS score for the sample from each participant's score, the mean of the resulting centered SWLS score is zero. When the analysis is run again, b1 now represents the difference between males and females at the mean level of the SWLS score of the sample. An example of conceptual moderation model with one categorical and one continuous independent variable. Cohen et al. (2003) recommended using the following to probe the simple effect of gender on the dependent variable (Y) at three levels of the continuous independent variable: high (one standard deviation above the mean), moderate (at the mean), and low (one standard deviation below the mean). If the scores of the continuous variable are not standardized, one can just calculate these three values by adding or subtracting one standard deviation of the original scores; if the scores of the continuous variable are standardized, one can calculate the three values as follows: high = the standardized score minus 1, moderate (mean = 0), low = the standardized score plus 1. Then one can explore the effects of gender on the dependent variable (Y) at high, moderate, and low levels of the SWLS score. As with two categorical independent variables, b2 represents the effect of the SWLS score on the dependent variable for females. By reverse coding the gender variable, one can get the effect of the SWLS score on the dependent variable for males.  Coding in moderated regression  thumb A statistical diagram that depicts a moderation model with W with 3 levels, as a multi-categorical independent variable. When treating categorical variables such as ethnic groups and experimental treatments as independent variables in moderated regression, one needs to code the variables so that each code variable represents a specific setting of the categorical variable. There are three basic ways of coding: Dummy-variable coding, Effects coding, and Contrast coding. Below is an introduction to these coding systems. thumb Dummy coding is used when one has a reference group or one condition in particular (e.g. a control group in the experiment) that is to be compared to each of the other experimental groups. In this case, the intercept is the mean of the reference group, and each of the unstandardized regression coefficients is the difference in the dependent variable between one of the treatment groups and the mean of the reference group (or control group). This coding system is similar to ANOVA analysis, and is appropriate when researchers have a specific reference group and want to compare each of the other groups with it. Effects coding is used when one does not have a particular comparison or control group and does not have any planned orthogonal contrasts. The intercept is the grand mean (the mean of all the conditions). The regression coefficient is the difference between the mean of one group and the mean of all the group means (e.g. the mean of group A minus the mean of all groups). This coding system is appropriate when the groups represent natural categories. Contrast coding is used when one has a series of orthogonal contrasts or group comparisons that are to be investigated. In this case, the intercept is the unweighted mean of the individual group means. The unstandardized regression coefficient represents the difference between the unweighted mean of the means of one group (A) and the unweighted mean of another group (B), where A and B are two sets of groups in the contrast. This coding system is appropriate when researchers have an a priori hypothesis concerning the specific differences among the group means. = Two continuous independent variables = A Conceptual Diagram of An Additive Multiple Moderation Model interaction effect plot If both of the independent variables are continuous, it is helpful for interpretation to either center or standardize the independent variables, X and Z. (Centering involves subtracting the overall sample mean score from the original score; standardizing does the same followed by dividing by the overall sample standard deviation.) By centering or standardizing the independent variables, the coefficient of X or Z can be interpreted as the effect of that variable on Y at the mean level of the other independent variable.Dawson, J. F. (2013). Moderation in management research: What, why, when and how. Journal of Business and Psychology. . To probe the interaction effect, it is often helpful to plot the effect of X on Y at low and high values of Z (some people prefer to also plot the effect at moderate values of Z, but this is not necessary). Often values of Z that are one standard deviation above and below the mean are chosen for this, but any sensible values can be used (and in some cases there are more meaningful values to choose). The plot is usually drawn by evaluating the values of Y for high and low values of both X and Z, and creating two lines to represent the effect of X on Y at the two values of Z. Sometimes this is supplemented by simple slope analysis, which determines whether the effect of X on Y is statistically significant at particular values of Z. Various internet-based tools exist to help researchers plot and interpret such two-way interactions.http://www.jeremydawson.co.uk/slopes.htm A conceptual diagram of a moderated moderation model, otherwise known as a three-way interaction. = Higher-level interactions = The principles for two-way interactions apply when we want to explore three-way or higher-level interactions. For instance, if we have a three-way interaction between A, B, and C, the regression equation will be as follows: : Y = b_0 + b_1A + b_2B + b_3C + b_4A\\\\cdot B + b_5A\\\\cdot C + b_6B\\\\cdot C + b_7A\\\\cdot B\\\\cdot C + \\\\varepsilon. = Spurious higher-order effects = It is worth noting that the reliability of the higher-order terms depends on the reliability of the lower-order terms. For example, if the reliability for variable A is 0.70, and reliability for variable B is 0.80, then the reliability for the interaction variable A * B is 0.70 √ó 0.80 = 0.56. In this case, low reliability of the interaction term leads to low power; therefore, we may not be able to find the interaction effects between A and B that actually exist. The solution for this problem is to use highly reliable measures for each independent variable. Another caveat for interpreting the interaction effects is that when variable A and variable B are highly correlated, then the A * B term will be highly correlated with the omitted variable A2; consequently what appears to be a significant moderation effect might actually be a significant nonlinear effect of A alone. If this is the case, it is worth testing a nonlinear regression model by adding nonlinear terms in individual variables into the moderated regression analysis to see if the interactions remain significant. If the interaction effect A*B is still significant, we will be more confident in saying that there is indeed a moderation effect; however, if the interaction effect is no longer significant after adding the nonlinear term, we will be less certain about the existence of a moderation effect and the nonlinear model will be preferred because it is more parsimonious.

During winter, the flow of the upper ocean is directed westward from near the Indonesian Archipelago to the Arabian Sea. During the summer, the direction reverses, with eastward flow extending from Somalia into the Bay of Bengal. These variations are due to changes in the wind stress associated with the Indian monsoon. The seasonally reversing open ocean currents that pass south of India are referred to as the Winter Monsoon Current and the Summer Monsoon Current (alternately, the Northeast Monsoon Current and the Southwest Monsoon Current).Shankar, D., P. N. Vinayachandran and A. S. Unnikrishnan, 2002: The monsoon current in the north Indian Ocean, Progress In Oceanography, Volume 52, Issue 1, Pages 63‚Äì120. The Somali Current, which is strongly linked to the Indian monsoon, is also discussed in this article. (topmost current) The Southwest and Northeast Monsoon Drift  Overview  = Historical perspective = Although Mariners have been aware of the existence of the Monsoon current for nearly one thousand years, a detailed understanding did not emerge until after the International Indian Ocean Expedition of the 1960s. The World Ocean Circulation Experiment of the mid 1990s permitted detailed measurement of these currents through an extensive field campaign.Schott, Friedrich A. and Julian P. McCreary, Jr., 2001: The monsoon circulation of the Indian Ocean, Progress In Oceanography, Volume 51, Issue 1, Pages 1‚Äì123. = Atmospheric forcing = In the northern hemisphere tropical regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, surface winds blow predominantly from the northeast year round, with westward-flowing ocean currents underneath. The Indian Ocean differs from the Atlantic and Pacific in that a continental landmass forms a complete northern boundary at relatively low latitudes. Monsoonal circulations are driven by the differences in temperature between land masses and adjacent oceans.Savtchenko, Andrey. \\"An assessment of the Indian Ocean, Monsoon, and Somali Current using NASA's AIRS, MODIS, and QuikSCAT data\\" . NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center, Code 610.2, L-3 Communications Government Service Inc. Retrieved on 2008-11-03. Because water has a larger thermal capacity than air, land surfaces will heat more rapidly during the summer season. The Indian monsoon consists of two phases. During the northern hemisphere winter, the cool Asian landmass contains a broad area of high pressure, whereas lower pressures prevail over the warmer Indian Ocean and hot Australian continent. This pressure pattern helps to reinforce the northeasterly trade winds. During the northern hemisphere summer, the Asian landmass (especially the Indian subcontinent) heats considerably, generating an area of low pressure to the north. Circulation about this low generates strong winds from the southwest over the Arabian Sea and along the Somali coast. These winds are enhanced by the formation of an atmospheric western boundary current created by the high terrain over eastern Africa. A consequence of the Coriolis effect, Ekman theory explains that oceanic flow at the surface is directed at 45 degrees to the right of the wind stress in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, winds blowing from the southwest result in eastward currents, while winds blowing from the northeast result in westward currents.  Structure and evolution  = Winter season structure = The Winter Monsoon Current extends from the Bay of Bengal, around India and Sri Lanka, and across the Arabian Sea at a latitude of approximately 8 degrees North. Currents flow to the southwest along the coast of Somalia to the equator. Measurements of the strengths of these currents have been obtained from ship drift records. The Northeast Monsoon Current is westward only during the months of January through March, and is strongest in February when it reaches 50 cm s‚àí1.Hastenrath, Stefan and Lawrence Greischar, 1991: The Monsoonal Current Regimes of the Tropical Indian Ocean: Observed Surface Flow Fields and Their Geostrophic and Wind-Driven Components, Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 96, No. C7, Pages 12,619‚Äì12,633. Estimates of westward volume transport range from 7 to 14 Sverdrups. = Summer season structure = The Somali Current, which describes the flow along the Horn of Africa from the equator to around 9 degrees north,Lighthill, M.J., 1969: Dynamic Response of the Indian Ocean to Onset of the Southwest Monsoon, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Vol. 265, No. 1159, pp. 45‚Äì92. also shifts direction seasonally with the monsoon winds. It eventually separates from the coastline, turning to the right as it enters the Arabian Sea. The Summer Monsoon Current, located between 10 and 15 North latitude in the Arabian Sea, bends around India and Sri Lanka, and enters the Bay of Bengal. The Great Whirl is a gyre located around 10 N and 55 E, and is only present during the summer season. During the summer when the current flows toward the northeast, Ekman transport (to the right of the flow in the Northern Hemisphere) is offshore, transporting warmer waters deeper into the Arabian sea, and permitting upwelling of cooler waters along the coast. This sea surface temperature pattern (cooler waters west of warmer waters) reinforces the northward current through geostrophic flow. The Southwest Monsoon Current is eastward from April through November, and reaches a peak intensity of 30 cm s‚àí1 during the summer months. During a 1995 field campaign, the Somali current was measured to transport 37 +/- 5 Sv during mid- September.Beal, Lisa and Theresa K. Chereskin, 2003: The volume transport of the Somali Current during the 1995 southwest monsoon, Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, Volume 50, Issues 12‚Äì13, Pages 2077‚Äì2089. = Evolution = The rapid initiation of seasonal currents (over the time period of several weeks) can be explained theoretically in terms of linear theory with a Rossby wave response. The Monsoon Current can also be viewed in terms of local forcing processes that act in concert to create the mature, basin-wide system.

Wolfson is best remembered as the education director of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union during the second half of the 1920s and as a leader of the workers education movement during the 1930s. Biography =Early years= Theresa Wolfson was born July 19, 1897 in Brooklyn, New York. Wolfson's parents, Adolph Wolfson and Rebecca Hochstein Wolfson, were ethnic Jewish radicals who emigrated from Russia in 1894 to escape the pervasive anti-semitism and political persecution of the Tsarist regime. During her elementary school years Wolfson attended public school in Brooklyn before attending high school at Far Rockaway, Long Island.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 253. Wolfson attended Adelphi College in Garden City, New York, where she helped to organize a campus chapter of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society in 1916. Following her graduation in 1917, Wolfson worked as a volunteer health worker at a settlement house in New York City. =Career= In 1918 Wolfson became a field investigator for the National Child Labor Committee, remaining at that job until 1920. In this capacity Wolfson was the author of several reports on child labor in the textile industry of North Carolina. From 1920 to 1922, Wolfson served as Executive Director of the New York Consumers' League, heading its political efforts on behalf of the 8-hour day and minimum wage legislation.\\"Something Rotten in America,\\" Jewish Woman's Archive, jwa.org/ Retrieved May 14, 2011. During this time Wolfson also attended graduate courses, receiving a Master's degree in economics in 1922 from Columbia University and completing her PhD in 1924. She also taught briefly as an instructor at Barnard College in this interval. Following completion of her academic work, Wolfson went to work for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union as the education director of its Union Health Center. She also became involved in the workers' education movement by teaching at the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry and by lecturing at Brookwood Labor College, headed by A.J. Muste. She published her dissertation \\"The Woman Worker and the Trade Unions\\" in 1926. In 1928 Wolfson accepted a post at Brooklyn College (at the time a branch of Hunter College), where she remained as a professor of economics and labor relations until her retirement in 1967. Wolfson also remained active in workers' education as a teacher during summer schools conducted by the American Labor Education Service. For this activity Wolfson was recognized in 1957 with the John Dewey Award of the League for Industrial Democracy.Audrey J. Lezberg Lyke, \\"Theresa Wolfson, 1897-1972,\\" Jewish Women's Archive, jwa.org/ Retrieved May 13, 2011. Wolfson's work in the field of labor relations focused on the education and advancement of women in the workplace, and the unequal treatment of women within trade unions. =Personal life= Wolfson married Dr. Iago Galdston, a psychiatrist, in 1920. The couple had two children before divorcing in 1935. In 1938 Wolfson married Austin Bigelow Wood, a psychology instructor on the staff with her at Brooklyn College. Her brother Victor Wolfson was a notable playwright and novelist. =Death and legacy= Theresa Wolfson died on May 14, 1972 at the age of 74. A scholarship in her name allows a Brooklyn College student to pursue graduate studies in labor economics each year.

In 1962 it became the first colour supplement to be published as a supplement to a UK newspaper, and its arrival \\"broke the mould of weekend newspaper publishing\\".Whatever Happened To Gob-Smacking Surprise?: InPublishing The magazine has in-depth journalism, high-quality photography and an extensive range of subject matter. It has had many famous contributors, including international authors, photographers and artists. History The first edition of The Sunday Times Colour Section was published on 4 February 1962, and included some significant harbingers of the Swinging Sixties. These included 11 photographs on the cover of Jean Shrimpton wearing a Mary Quant dress, photographed by David Bailey, and a new James Bond story by Ian Fleming, entitled \\"The Living Daylights\\" ‚Äì a title that would be used for a Bond film 25 years later. The publication subsequently changed its title to The Sunday Times Colour Magazine, and was modified shortly afterwards to The Sunday Times Magazine. The first editor was Mark Boxer; subsequent editors included Godfrey Smith, Magnus Linklater, Hunter Davies, Ron Hall, Philip Clarke and Robin Morgan. The present editor, Sarah Baxter, took over in 2009. The magazine has published lengthy and detailed articles on major events, from the Great Train Robbery to 9/11, from Beatlemania to Britart, and from the 1969 moon landing to the 2012 London Olympic Games.

He went on to champion the work of such photographers as Terry O'Neill, Brian Duffy, Richard Avedon, Eugene Richards, Diane Arbus, Mary Ellen Mark. The magazine featured images from the Vietnam war by the photographer Don McCullin, a photo-essay on the Vatican by Eve Arnold, many portraits and photo-essays by Lord Snowdon, and Bert Stern's final photoshoot with Marilyn Monroe, among many other photographic collections. The magazine's weekly columnists have included Jilly Cooper, Zo√´ Heller and Daisy Waugh and its best known cover artists have included Sir Peter Blake, David Hockney, Alan Aldridge and Ian Dury. Since 1977 the magazine has published the column \\"A Life In The Day\\", which has revealed intimate everyday details via interviews with many prominent people, including Nelson Mandela, Muhammad Ali, Paul McCartney, Nancy Dell'Olio, Muammar Gaddafi, Kate Winslet and Celine Dion. Recent highlights in the magazine have included David James Smith's account of the 9/11 victims who jumped from the World Trade Center (\\"The Fallen\\"), for which Smith won Features Reporter of the Year at the British Press Awards for 2011;Press Awards 2011: The full list of winners  PressGazette Lynn Barber's 2010 interview with the writer Christopher Hitchens; and John Arlidge's 2009 interview with Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. In 1990 the magazine established the Ian Parry Scholarship, in order to encourage young photographers and help them to undertake the assignments of their choice. The scholarship was created in honour of Ian Parry, who was killed in Romania in 1989, at the age of 24, while on assignment for the magazine. Prizes are still awarded annually to winning entrants. In December 2010, the magazine became viewable on the Apple iPad, and in February 2012 it celebrated its 50th anniversary.

Background Prior to the invention of title insurance buyers in real estate transactions bore sole responsibility for ensuring the validity of the land title held by the seller. If the title were later deemed invalid or found to be fraudulent, the buyer lost their investment. In 1868, the case of Watson v. Muirhead was heard by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Plaintiff Muirhead had lost his investment in a real estate transaction as the result of a prior lien on the property. Defendant Watson, the conveyancer, had discovered the lien prior to the sale but told Muirhead the title was clear after his lawyer had (erroneously) determined that the lien was not valid. The courts ruled that Watson (and others in similar situations) was not liable for mistakes based on professional opinions.57 Pa. 161 (1868) As a result of the case the Pennsylvania legislature included a section allowing for the incorporation of title insurance companies in The General Corporation Act passed an 1874.National Title-Duluth, Inc.

It was one of two early local teleprocessing packages for IBM's DOS/VSE environment. DUCS provided an interface and access method for programmers to 'talk' to monitors. Such access methods later became known as APIs. Initially written for the IBM 2260 running under DOS on IBM mainframes, the original product was free for IBM users. With the advent of DOS/VS and the IBM 3270 series terminals, the original author commercialized the product, circa 1970. The company added transparent remote access about 1972. The product is believed to be the first non-IBM publicly available commercial software package to transmit data via satellite.CFS brochure, 1976  Application  DUCS differed from competing products such as Westi and IBM's own CICS in that it was subordinate to the application's mainline program. Westi, for example, was the mainline program and users wrote subroutines to read and write data to and from terminals and discs. This real time paradigm became known as transaction processing. DUCS reversed that model in that it was, in fact, a subroutine package that read from and wrote to monitors, both local and remote. While DUCS was considerably easier to program and use, it also placed the onus of task management upon the programmer. Correctly designed, a DUCS program was faster than any competing package or access method.  Development  = 2260 = Dick Goran wrote the original DOS 2260 package. Its popularity made him realize it had potential as a commercial product, and he left IBM about 1970, and incorporated in Brookline, Massachusetts as CFS, Inc. = 3270 = In 1972, IBM released DOS/VS with the IBM/370 and the first IBM 3270 terminals, and CFS began a rewrite for the new products. Former New York City IBMer, Leigh Lundin, wrote DUCS Remote, a bi-sync module to handle remote teleprocessing. The bi-sync handler was only 4k, in contrast to IBM's BTAM at 28k, QTAM at 36k, and TCAM at 42k, and VTAM which started at 48k. = Demos = Lundin wrote games in Fortran and Assembler and Goran in COBOL to demonstrate the API for programmers. To model IBM's new light pen, programmers contributed a simple tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses), possibly the only practical use of the subsequently discontinued light pen.  Marketing  DUCS was sold in North America by CFS, Inc, Brookline, Ma. For overseas sales, CFS engaged in both mail order and local vendors.

The concept of pseudoreflection generalizes the concepts of reflection and complex reflection, and is simply called reflection by some mathematicians. It plays an important role in Invariant theory of finite groups, including the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem. Formal Definition Suppose that V is vector space over a field K, whose dimension is a finite number n. A pseudoreflection is an invertible linear transformation g: V\\\\to V such that the order of g is finite and the fixed subspace V^g = { v\\\\in V:\\\\ gv=v } of all vectors in V fixed by g has dimension n-1. Eigenvalues A pseudoreflection g has an eigenvalue 1 of multiplicity n-1 and another eigenvalue r of multiplicity 1. Since g has finite order, the eigenvalue r must be a root of unity in the field K. It is possible that r = 1 (see Transvections). Diagonalizable pseudoreflections Let p be the characteristic of the field K. If the order of g is coprime to p then g is diagonalizable and represented by a diagonal matrix diag(1, ... , 1, r ) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & r \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} where r is a root of unity not equal to 1. This includes the case when K is a field of characteristic zero, such as the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers. A diagonalizable pseudoreflection is sometimes called a semisimple reflection. Real reflections When K is the field of real numbers, a pseudoreflection has matrix form diag(1, ... , 1, -1). A pseudoreflection with such matrix form is called a real reflection. If the space on which this transformation acts admits a symmetric bilinear form so that orthogonality of vectors can be defined, then the transformation is a true reflection. Complex reflections When K is the field of complex numbers, a pseudoreflection is called a complex reflection, which can be represented by a diagonal matrix diag(1, ... , 1, r) where r is a complex root of unity unequal to 1. Transvections If the pseudoreflection g is not diagonalizable then r = 1 and g has Jordan normal form \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 1 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} In such case g is called a transvection. A pseudoreflection g is a transvection if and only if the characteristic p of the field K is positive and the order of g is p. Transvections are useful in the study of finite geometries and the classification of their groups of motions.

Its last assignment was with the United States Air Forces in Europe, based at Neubiberg Air Base, Germany. It was inactivated on 25 September 1947. History Established and organized at Paine Field, Washington in 1943 as a command and control organization. Deployed to the European Theater of Operations (ETO) in late 1943 and assigned to IX Fighter Command, Ninth Air Force. Initial Mission of the Wing was to receive operational orders from Headquarters, IX Fighter Command and direct subordinate groups in attacking enemy targets in Occupied France and the Low Countries in preparation for the Normandy Invasion in June 1944. Targets included bridges, roads, railroads and enemy interceptor aircraft both on the ground as well as in air-to-air combat. After the D-Day invasion, was reassigned to IX Tactical Air Command (IX TAC) and directed to provide ground support for advancing United States First Army forces in France, attacking enemy targets initially in the Cotentin Peninsula, then supported Operation Cobra, the breakout of Normandy and attacked enemy forces in the Falaise-Argentan Gap. Wing headquarters and subordinate units operated primarily from liberated airfields and newly built temporary Advanced Landing Grounds in France, moved into north-central France, its groups attacking enemy targets near Paris then north-west into Belgium and the southern Netherlands. In December 1944/January 1945, engaged enemy targets on the north side of the Battle of the Bulge, then moved eastward into the Northern Rhineland as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Supported First Army as it crossed the Rhine River at Remagen then moved north to attack ground targets in the Ruhr, providing air support as Allied ground forces encircled enemy forces in the Ruhr Pocket, essentially ending organized enemy resistance in Western Germany. First Army halted its advance at the Elbe River in late April 1945, the wing engaging targets of opportunity in enemy- controlled areas until combat was ended on 5 May 1945. Remained in Europe after the war as part of United States Air Forces in Europe, performing occupation duty and the destruction or shipment to the United States of captured enemy combat equipment. Assigned units also performed air defense duty over the American Zone of Occupation.

Located 11 miles north of Onaway, Michigan, the mountain is a popular recreational activity site and is part of the state-owned Black Mountain Forest Recreation Area, which is operated by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. History Black Mountain and the range in which it is situated were created by the glacial movement of the last major ice age. Nearby, Woodland Lake was also created by these glaciers. The area was inhabited by Native Americans until around 1800, when settlers from New England established \\"Ore Creek,\\" which later became known as \\"Brighton.\\" Gradually, the areas around Black Mountain have been developed. The Brighton area is now home to over 7000 people; Black Mountain lies in a residential zone of varying density. Due to deforestation, erosion has become an increasingly severe problem on parts of the mountain. Beginning in the 1990s, the property around Black Mountain was developed; this process continues today. The road next to the mountain was extended. To date, two houses have been built at the base of the mountain. In addition, several lots surrounding the mountain are currently for sale. The owners of the mountain have donated the land to the state of Michigan and it is now a state park. Geography and climate Black Mountain was created by glaciers in the last major ice age. The range is characterized by medium to steep grade, with deep valleys and high peaks. Located in northeastern Michigan, the base elevation is approximately , while the highest point is over . Black Mountain and the surrounding hills range in vertical rise from as little as to as much as on the mountain itself. Woodland Lake lies at the base of the western hills, and is around deep. The area experiences a four-season temperate climate, with cold winters and hot summers. The largest amounts of precipitation occur in the months of December and January, while July and August are the driest. The typical winter season begins in November and lasts well into March. Annual snowfall averages 70 to . Daily January temperatures normally reach 20 to , with nighttime lows of 5 to 15 degrees. July highs are 75 to 85 degrees, and lows are 55 to 65 degrees. Skiing With more than of trails, hikers and skiers have their choice of routes for every skill level. Special pathways have been constructed for the traditional diagonal skier and the skate-skier. Pathways range from \\"Easy\\" to \\"Most Difficult\\". Skiers may find themselves gliding under majestic pines, taking in views of Black Lake and, under the right conditions, even getting a glimpse of Lake Huron. Trail users travel through a number of forest types and are able to see what a managed forest looks like in its various stages of regrowth. Four separate parking lots provide skiers and hikers access to the pathway loops which best suit their abilities or interests. Other Attractions There are multiple trails going around Black Mountain and through it. Three parking lots serve as access points to about of ORV trails and of ORV routes. All terrain vehicles (ATVs) and dirt bike enthusiasts will find plenty to be excited about. In addition to the winding trails and generally straight routes, there is a scramble area for motorcycles and ATVs. (This area is closed to 4X4 trucks). Legal access to trails, routes and the scramble area is at the upper level of Black Lake Campground. The network of paths throughout the mountain, while most often used for dirt biking, are also used for mountain biking, unicycling, and other similar sports. During the winter season, the paths on the mountain are a popular attraction for area snowmobilers.

It advocates the promotion and recognition of the Valencian language, culture and the political sovereignty of the Land of Valencia. As an ideology, it has had varying levels of social and political influence since the nineteenth century, contributing to the consolidation of self-government in the Valencian Community as a political entity tracing its origins to the Ancient Kingdom of Valencia.El valencianisme pol√≠tic del segle XX i el Pa√≠s Valenci√† del segle XXI, Vicent Flor i Moreno a Catalan-nationalist groups are also included under the name of Valencian nationalism, as most Valencian nationalists see the Land of Valencia as part of the Catalan nation. Historically, Valencianism originates in the 19th century as a cultural movement during the Renaixen√ßa, a period of time where intellectuals tried to recover the culture status for the Valencian-Catalan language after centuries of diglossia and the suppression of the Kingdom of Valencia under borbonical absolutism with initiatives like the Floral Games held by Lo Rat Penat. Scissions from this association would be the first political organisations of the Valencianism, appeared at the beginning of the 20th century. The symbolical birthdate of Valencianism is considered to be 1902, when Faust√≠ Barber√† reads De regionalisme i valentinicultura. One of the first milestones for Valencianism would be the Declaraci√≥ Valencianista made in 1918, although it was not until the Second Spanish Republic that Valencianism would achieve certain political influence and a climate prone to achieve a Statute of Autonomy. With the creation of Francoist Spain, the Valencianist tradition was repressed and Valencian regionalism was dissolved and instrumentalised in Spain. In the 1960s Joan Fuster i Ortells emerged as a referent of a modern Valencianism, the Fusteranism that broke with the discourse of the regionalism allowed by the state. The importance given by the Fusteranists to the cultural and linguistic unity of the Catalan Countries, concept that became central in his proposal, would explain the emergence of the blaverism, an anti-catalanist Valencian regionalism.

As a younger son, he would not inherit his father's property, so he entered the army. He became a cornet in the Royal Regiment of Dragoons in 1713, and a captain in the 27th Regiment of Foot in 1716. He rose to the rank of major in 1718 and was Fort Major at Fort St Philip on Menorca. He became Member of Parliament for Renfrewshire in 1722, and represented the constituency until 1727.

Biography =Childhood and adolescence= Avi Schwartz was born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1938. His family was in the diamond business. Early in life he absorbed artistic values at home, where the walls were decorated with pictures from his father's rich art collection. The realityle of portraits and scenery was then considered classic, and Avi strived to imitate it. His opportunity came during World War II, while Bucharest was being bombed, and he and his family were forced to remain at home for long periods of time. During those days he copied the pictures he saw before him. In 1947 his family succeeded in leaving Romania and immigrated to Israel in 1948, via Paris. Here they were met by his grandfather, Moses Josephson, the first president of the Israel Diamond Exchange, who had immigrated to Palestine before the war. In his youth he studied in the \\"Shalva High School in Tel Aviv, and with his parents' encouragement he enrolled in the Avni Institute (a college for Art and Design). He was the youngest student there, and was proud to have successfully passed its entrance exams. The Avni Institute was then run by Moshe Mokady, and among its teachers were Yehezkel Streichman, Avigdor Stematsky, and Marcel Janko. =The Avni Institute and beyond= During this period the prevailing artistic perceptions at the Avni Institute leaned towards abstract art and were in search of a new, modernistic and cosmopolitan language of expression. This was in contradiction to the \\"old Bezalel art\\", \\"tourist paintings\\" and realism that imitated what the eye saw. In the Avni institute Avi became exposed to abstract expressionism, to an approach which considered art to be an intuitive medium for the expression of feelings, reflecting fantasy and the subconscious, etc. According to this view, realistic painting had reached its summit, and had thus come to an end. The process of study at the Institute consisted of basic, primary guidance during the lesson, emphasizing work at home - work by trial and error, then standing up to critique in class. Schwartz did not relate well to these methods, nor to the artistic language of Steimatzky or Streichman and Janco, who belonged to the group called \\"New Horizons\\". He was looking for \\"the real thing\\" according to him, figurative painting. This lack of communication between him and his teachers led to an \\"arid period\\", during which he ceased to paint. When the Sinai Campaign broke out, Avi left the Avni Institute and his high school and enlisted in the army, the IDF. Later he married Nurit, finished his matriculation exams, and for a short period studied history in the Tel Aviv University. To make a living he worked in diamond polishing and later managed the diamond, precious stone and metalworking department in the Ramat Gan ORT School. He began painting again only at the age of 30, when he met the artist Zvi Shorr, who told him that \\"the world is not abstract, and no painting should be abstract - paint the world as you see it\\". Zvi Schor had been exposed to modern art and French Expressionism, and had even lived for some time in Paris. Despite this, his paintings remained descriptive and realistic, made by impressionistic movements of the paintbrush, inspired by the paintings of Edgar Degas, Paul C√©zanne and others. Avi Schwartz was very much influenced by him, and was considered \\"the direct disciple of Zvi Schor\\". =Back to the art world= Schwartz also studied art with Professor Schwartzman, but was most influenced by two artists who became his \\"masters\\"- Shimshon Holzman and Arieh Lubin. Holzman was identified with the artists of the Paris School, and became known as an outstanding aquarelle painter. Aryeh Lubin was influenced by C√©zanne, and painted illuminated Safad synagogues, vendors in the Tiberias marketplace, and Arabic characters in cafes. The friendship that developed between Schwartz, Holzman and Lubin, led to regular meetings, during which the three of them sometimes traveled to the markets of Ramle and Lod, but mostly worked and painted together in cafes and at the Jaffa seafront. They were joined at times by Nachum Gutman. In 1979 Holzman invited Schwartz to Paris to join the workshops that were being held in the famous art school, the \\"Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re\\", and he complied. =Style characteristics= Zvi Shorr, whose personality was formed by European culture, was very pedantic with his pupil Avi Schwartz about the use of colors in his paintings ‚Äìmainly burnt Sienna, Prussian blue, and ochre yellow. On the other hand, Holzman and Lubin exposed him to other color options, emphasizing Israeli sunlight and sharp contrasts. Schwartz incorporated their teaching into his art, and like them was inspired by the sights and experiences he absorbed outside the studio. His works are deeply connected to the viewed object (landscapes, figures, etc.), permeating urban reality, Jaffa neighborhoods, its coffee shops, sea and port, etc. Schwartz' paintings deal with the figurative representation of space, showing figures drawn on site, catching immediate impressions, focusing especially on characters from the marginal strata of society: unfortunate people at rest or at work. Even though his works deal with social themes, it must be emphasized that they do not express any political or socially subversive stand. His subjects are not drawn as a protest against the social wrongs perpetrated against them by the ruling powers, or even to show their \\"miserable existence\\". Schwartz observes his subjects, and translates what he sees from his very personal viewpoint to the canvas. He \\"maps out\\" his figures as viewed from some distance, without being an integral part of the scene.

He was Andrew Loog Oldham's business partner from 1963 to December 1969. During a career spanning over 50 years he was instrumental in promoting a number of successful songs in the UK Singles Chart, including the Rolling Stones \\"Little Red Rooster\\" and \\"Paint It, Black\\", the Small Faces \\"Itchycoo Park\\", Amen Corner's \\"(If Paradise Is) Half as Nice\\", Eddy Grant‚Äôs \\"I Don't Wanna Dance\\" and Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers single \\"Swing the Mood\\". 1960s Calder was born in Surbiton, Surrey to Scottish parents. His grounding in the music industry began in the early 1960s at Decca Records under the direction of Edward Lewis. By day he worked in the sales and marketing department. which gave him a significant insight into the music industry and led him to meeting Brian Epstein, The Beatles, Andrew Loog Oldham and Seymour Stein (who introduced Calder to his all-time record hero George Goldner). In 1962 Calder was hired by Brian Epstein to promote The Beatles single \\"Love Me Do\\", which he did successfully by sending free copies to the top fifty Mecca Ballrooms and also the opposition Top Rank ballrooms, in order to persuade the local independent record shops to order the record. The following year pop impresario Andrew Oldham and Calder merged their clientele to set up the UK's first independent PR-pop company, ‚ÄòIMAGE.‚Äô, and handled the day-to-day management of the Rolling Stones, and later the promotion of the Beach Boys via their publishing contract. In early 1965, Calder did his first and last record production, taking over from Oldham producing Marianne Faithfull, producing her biggest hits \\"Come and Stay With Me\\", which reached Number 4 in the UK Singles Chart and \\"This Little Bird\\", which reached Number 6 in 1965. In 1965 Calder and Oldham formed Immediate Records, the first major independent label in the UK, eventually responsible for acts like The Small Faces, Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, The McCoys, Chris Farlowe, Amen Corner, P.P. Arnold and The Nice. He also worked with Vashti Bunyan for the label, although it was not until the 2000s that she became a cult hero. At the end of 1969 Calder left Immediate Records. 1970s In 1971, Calder signed the new band Bay City Rollers with his booking agent business partner David Apps, but quickly relinquished the contract to Dick Leahy, head of Bell Records. In 1975, Calder was appointed CEO of NEMS Records, where he signed Black Sabbath, Pluto and Marianne Faithfull. However he left this position soon after, and spent the following year setting old friend and fashion designer Ossie Clark back in business; licensing his designs and his name to forge a revival of Clark's image.

Before the information reached the Superintendent, the police officer became aware of the offer. It was held that the officer was entitled to claim the reward. Judgment This case held that advertisements of reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of the perpetrator of a crime is treated as an offer, as the intention to be bound is inferred from the fact that no further bargaining is expected to result from them. The case is sometimes wrongly cited as authority for the proposition that acceptance in ignorance of an offer is effective. A better authority for this proposition is the Australian case of R v Clarke. This case is a weak authority for this proposition because the party claiming reward possessed full knowledge of the offer by the time the offer was accepted; in cases such as this, acceptance is only effective when the prescribed action had been completed, i.e. when information reaches the offeror.Andrew Burrows, 'A Casebook on Contract' (4th edn, Hart Publishing 2013) at page 46 See also *Williams v Carwardine *R v Clarke References Category:1891 in case law Category:1891 in British law Category:English contract case law Category:English agreement case law ","title":"Gibbons v Proctor"},{"id":"20085358","text":"1962 senate campaign Marvella Belle Hern Bayh (February 14, 1933 ‚Äì April 24, 1979) was the wife of Indiana Senator Birch Bayh, the mother of former Indiana Senator Birch Evans Bayh III (Evan), and a national spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society. Life Bayh was born in the Garfield County, Oklahoma, town of Lahoma, and was the daughter of Bernett E. (n√©e Monson) and Delbert Murphy Hern. Her ancestry included Norwegian, German, and English. (Other sources say that she was born in Enid, Oklahoma.) She grew up on a farm in Oklahoma, was elected to the top position in Oklahoma Girls State and president of Girls Nation, and attended Oklahoma State University. In 1951, she defeated her future husband in a national \\"outstanding young orator\\" competition sponsored by the National Farm Bureau. She completed her degree in education at Indiana University in 1960. She married Birch Bayh in August 1952 and moved to Indiana. When he decided to run first for the Indiana House of Representatives in 1954 and then for the US Senate in 1962 she began her career as a political wife. Former senator Bill Bradley described her as \\"a valuable and active half of the Bayh political team.\\" Bayh suffered from a variety of health problems as the result of a car accident shortly after her marriage. Despite recurring back problems and double vision, Bayh remained deeply involved in the Washington political and social scene. She and her husband also survived a plane crash in 1964 that killed two people and critically injured Senator Ted Kennedy. The Bayhs were close friends with Senator Kennedy and his wife Joan Kennedy, as well as President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy. As an Oklahoman, Bayh also formed warm and close relationships with President Lyndon B. Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson. Bayh had a keen interest in current events and public affairs and was a skilled campaigner and public speaker. In 1967, President Johnson recognized her abilities and asked her to become the vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee‚Äîa job she turned down with great reluctance at the request of her husband's staff when he was launching his own Senate re-election campaign. Bayh later described his failure to intervene and support her wish to take the job as \\"totally selfish and insensitive\\" and said, \\"That was the worst mistake I ever made.\\" Personal tragedy also marred her family life. Her mother died early from heart failure, and her father became a violent alcoholic later in life, eventually murdering his second wife and then taking his own life. In 1971, Bayh was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy followed by radiation and 18 months of chemotherapy treatments. In order to support his wife, Birch Bayh announced that he would not be a candidate for president in 1972. After her recovery, Bayh (\\"the first public figure to experience and share her breast cancer publicly\\") became a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society. She wrote extensively about her experiences with cancer in her autobiography, Marvella: A Personal Journey. In 1974, she became a Bicentennial reporter for NBC's Sunday television program, a role she filled through July 4, 1976. In 1978, more than six years after her cancer operation and treatment, the cancer recurred. Despite aggressive treatment, she died on April 24, 1979 at the age of forty-six, at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.Bayh, Marvella and Kotz, Mary Lynn.

Bluebear, an anthropomorphic talking bear with blue fur who originally appeared in the German children's television program Die Sendung mit der Maus, has since then appeared in a film, a novel, a stage musical and various other media, all of which chronicle the character's life as a sailor and adventurer. Outside of Germany, Captain Bluebear is best known for being the protagonist of Moers' novel The 13¬Ω Lives of Captain Bluebear. The name pokes fun at the relative homophony between the German vowel \\"e\\" and umlaut \\"√§\\", when pronounced in a more colloquial, everyday style of language, especially in Northern Germany. In a compound noun the suffix \\"e\\" from \\"-beere\\" (Erdbeere/strawberry, Himbeere/raspberry, etc.) would very often not be pronounced at all: B√§r/Beer(e) - 'bear/berry' ... 'bluebear/blueberry'  Die Sendung mit der Maus  Captain Bluebear originally appeared in K√§pt'n Blaub√§rs Seemannsgarn (‚ÄúCaptain Bluebear's Sailor's Yarn‚Äù), a regular segment in the educational children's television series Die Sendung mit der Maus. Other regular characters of the Seemannsgarn episodes are Bluebear's sailor companion Hein Bl√∂d (an anthropomorphic rat whose name translates as ‚ÄúHarry Dim‚Äù) and his three grandchildren (little bears who have yellow, green and pink fur), all of which live with Bluebear in a ship stranded on a cliff. One episode would usually consist of Bluebear telling a cock-and-bull story to his grandchildren, with the frame narrative being made with animated puppets and Bluebear's story itself being a traditionally animated short film. The stories always take the form of a tall tale and usually have Captain Bluebear overcome some unbelievable obstacle or a seemingly all-powerful adversary who threatens to sink the Captain's ship. The little bears habitually doubt the veracity of their grandfather's tales, while Hein Bl√∂d acts as a buffoon character. The episodes sometimes contained allusions to other popular characters of German children's television like the Sandm√§nnchen, and also to other aspects of Walter Moers' work, e.g. in some episodes one of the little bears wears a pin- back button of Moers' adult comic character Little Asshole. Bluebear, Hein Bl√∂d and the three little bears later became part of other children's TV shows as well, such as K√§pt‚Äôn Blaub√§r Club and Blaub√§r und Bl√∂d.  Film and novel  In 1999 Captain Bluebear simultaneously appeared in a made-for-television feature film and in The 13¬Ω Lives of Captain Bluebear, Walter Moers' first fantasy novel. The novel reveals that Bluebear is a Chromobear (Buntb√§r) and thus belongs to a fictional race of ursines who inhabit the continent of Zamonia, which became a regular setting for most of Moers' fantasy novels. The 13¬Ω Lives of Captain Bluebear is presented as the autobiography of its eponymous hero, which nevertheless covers only the first half of his 27 lives‚Äîimplying that the other half is covered by the television episodes and making the novel a kind of origin story for the character. The novel ends with Bluebear rescuing his fellow Chromobears from slavery. The Chromobears (although not Bluebear himself) return in Moers' second Zamonia novel Ensel and Krete, in which they are shown as having established a touristic paradise in their native forest that the Chromobears nevertheless rule in a militaristic, semi-totalitarian way. The novels depart from the concept of the television program in that they are suited not only for children, but for adult readers as well. The traditionally animated film K√§pt'n Blaub√§r ‚Äì Der Film was written by Moers and directed by Hayo Freitag. It is based on the television episodes rather than the novel. Its plot centers around the mad scientist Prof. Dr. Feinfinger, who, in kidnapping the little bears, seeks revenge against their grandfather, who once thwarted Feinfinger's plan to achieve world domination. Feinfinger is voiced by German comedian Helge Schneider, who had previously participated in the film adaptations of Moers' Little Asshole character, while Bluebear's voice is provided by actor Wolfgang V√∂lz, who already voice-acted the Bluebear puppet in the Seemannsgarn episodes. The film also features an end title theme written and performed by Berlin rock group Die √Ñrzte.

Musicals  In 2006, The 13¬Ω Lives of Captain Bluebear was adapted into a stage musical composed by Martin Lingnau and written by Heiko Wohlgemuth. It premiered in the Musical Dome in Cologne. It was followed by two television musicals in 2008 and 2009 respectively, Die drei B√§rchen und der bl√∂de Wolf (‚ÄúThe Three Little Bears and the Dim Wolf‚Äù) and Abenteuer im Pizzawald (‚ÄúAdventures in the Pizza Forest‚Äù), both of which were in turn based on the television episodes.

It still has a titular absentee bishop (currently the auxiliary Bishop of Sydney, Richard Umbers), who is appointed by the Pope. In 1906, an attack by local bedouin on the French civil administration offices during the Thala-Kasserine Disturbances was the first violent resistance to French authority under the protectorate. Thala was the scene of fierce fighting during World War II, in the late stages of the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. The 10th Panzer Division sought to exploit its early success against US forces. In a series of defensive actions on 21 February 1943, the British 26th Armoured Brigade, part of Nickforce, and the divisional artilley of the U.S. 9th infantry Division, arriving after an 800 mile forced march, blocked an advance by the German division's Kampfgruppe which, despite coming under the personal command of Erwin Rommel, were finally unable to make headway through fire from British tanks and artillery.United States Army in World War II - Mediterranean Theater of Operations - Northwest Africa: Seizing the Initiative In the West, by George F.

The balloon was launched from East Hampton, New York on September 20, 1970, piloted by Malcolm Brighton, with Rodney Anderson and Pamela Brown on board. Background The adventure was conceived by Rodney Anderson and his wife, Pamela Brown. Pamela Brown was the actress daughter of Kentucky politician and attorney John Y. Brown Sr. and the sister of Kentucky Fried Chicken entrepreneur and future Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown Jr. At age 28, she and her 32-year-old husband, commodities broker Rod Anderson, hoped to break records with the first manned balloon flight across the Atlantic. The couple planned to recoup the cost of the venture by writing a book about their experience. When the pilot whom they had been counting on for the flight withdrew close to the time of departure, the Andersons hired Englishman Malcolm Brighton, 32, whose ascent in the Free Life was to be his 100th - and his last. Malcolm Brighton had built several balloons and became the main builder for the Bristol Belle, the name given to the first modern hot air balloon in Europe. The balloon The Free Life attempt was the first use of a Roziere style balloon for an Atlantic attempt, built by Mark Semich, using a combination of helium and hot air. Below the spherical helium gas cell is a conical sleeve where air can be heated by burners in the same way as a normal hot air balloon. By varying the hot air temperature, altitude can be maintained without having to release helium or to drop ballast. The burners are principally used to compensate for the lack of solar heating at night. Voyage After four years of planning and postponements, Brighton still had reservations about the balloon and in an interview, in which Brighton was asked what he thought of Free Life, he said Even experienced balloonists, to whom Brighton had confided his plans to pilot Free Life, advised against it. Despite this, the balloon was launched from George Sid Miller's pasture on Fireplace Road in Springs, New York on September 20, 1970. The weather was perfect; families picnicked and partied; the giant yellow, white and orange balloon, seven stories tall, was spectacular; spirits were high, and the 1,500 well-wishers seemed to share a sense of participating in something extraordinary, cheering their ascent. Disaster struck 30 hours after launch. A hot-air mechanism designed to maintain the balloon‚Äôs altitude at night failed on the second day of the flight. When the balloon encountered a high-altitude cold front and a severe rainstorm, they were forced to ditch in the Atlantic that night, about 600 miles southeast of Newfoundland. On September 21 came the last message from the Free Life. \\"We are ditching,\\" it said. \\"We request search and rescue.\\" The balloon went down in stormy seas off Newfoundland. Three Coast Guard cutters, a Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft and six United States Air Force and United States Coast Guard aircraft scoured the area for fourteen days. A few items from the balloon gondola were spotted, but the rescue effort was unsuccessful. Up to August 1978, ten subsequent transatlantic balloon crossing attempts were made: In February 1974, while making one such attempt, Colonel Thomas Leigh Gatch, Jr. USAR also disappeared in his Light Heart superpressure balloon. Finally, on August 17, 1978, three Americans - Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson, and Larry Newman crossed the Atlantic by balloon, in the Double Eagle II. Tributes In October 1972 Pamela Brown was memorialized with the opening of the Pamela Brown Auditorium, the first and largest theater in the newly built Actors Theatre of Louisville complex. A book commemorating the attempt was published in 1994 by writer and balloonist Anthony Smith. Entitled The Free Life: The Spirit of Courage, Folly and Obsession, the book was awarded the W.W. Norton & Co. thirteenth Annual Editors' Book Award. Smith was not present at the launch of the balloon in 1970, but he had taught Brighton to fly, and he had flown with him more frequently than anyone else.

Overview Within marketing accountability the expression ‚Äúintegrated marketing communications‚Äù (IMC) implies that marketing and communications are integrated within the business and management of the enterprise, not as a stand-alone functional silo. Analogous to other business functions like manufacturing and sales, accountable marketing is based on a set of valid outcome performance indicators and the associated activity input costs. Outcome performance indicators are called Effectiveness Metrics; Effectiveness combined with costs is called Efficiency (effectiveness per dollar spent).Winiarz, Marek P.E., The Method Handbook, Innovative Message for Managing, Method Marketing and Communications, MMC/SAN-06-0003-HB, February 2006. According to the Common Language Marketing Dictionary, Marketing accountability refers to the use of metrics to link a firm's marketing actions to financially relevant outcomes and growth over time. This accountability allows marketing to take responsibility for the profit or loss from investments in marketing activities, and to demonstrate the financial contributions of specific marketing programs to the overall financial objectives of the firm, including brand asset value. Return on marketing investment (ROMI), customer acquisition costs, and retention rates are examples of commonly employed marketing accountability metrics. Marketing Accountability was the subject of a report published in 1997 by Financial Times Management Reports It investigated a widespread problem that consultants McKinsey & Co. had described as \\"marketing's mid life crisis\\". Recent research by the Forbes CMO Practice and the Marketing Accountability Standards Board shows CMO are under growing pressure to show returns on rising investments in marketing assets, new media, data, analytics and technology needed to compete for digitally enabled customers. The complexity of marketing accountability has growth as marketers must add many more investments to the marketing portfolio to adapt to changing customer preferences and compete effectively for market share. According to Forbes research, the CMO of the average Global 5000 company must now allocate resources across at least 20 primary investment types in their annual budget. Methodology In order for indicators to be considered valid for accountability, they must meet a few minimum requirements. They need to measure marketing outcomes from the consumers‚Äô point of view, they need to include all marketing activities, they must be repeated over time, and they must meet statistical and technical criteria required of all measurement systems. The measurements need to be true outcome indicators. Unlike sales where the outcome is easily quantifiable, marketing is more difficult to define: there is not a direct, fast-acting relationship between marketing activities and sales. Some marketing materials are designed to inform, others attempt to portray the product or service attractively, yet others attempt to influence purchasing behavior. Most marketing campaigns include all three orientations; a brand may have glossy ads to boost attractiveness, brochures to convey information, and coupons with expiration dates to stimulate purchases. Thus a multiplicity of channels and contacts that influence target consumers needs to be measured together in order to understand the overall effect, and the separate effectiveness of the programs. The outcome indicator can be called ‚ÄúBrand Experience‚Äù, and only consumers can discern the resultant brand experience in the clutter of the marketplace as each message competes with others for attention.Jamhouri, Oscar, The Brand Experience Handbook, Process and Toolbox for Effective Brand Experience Strategies, Version 4, Integration Marketing Communications, September 2004. To assure meaningful comparisons among activities, brands, markets, and points in time; the metrics must use a common scale‚Äîa ‚Äúcommon currency‚Äù. This is quite obvious in accounting systems for multinational corporations, but in marketing all too often this principle is ignored. Different communications activities are evaluated using different measurements. These methods fall short of accountability in that the activities cannot be compared directly and their synergies cannot be discerned. Only measurement systems that use common units ‚Äì to evaluate each contact, each market, and each competitor ‚Äî can result in marketing accountability.Jamhouri, Oscar; Krause, Hans Ulrich, ‚ÄúBeyond Media Plans: Brand Experience Strategy‚Äù, (European Society of Opinion and Market Research Professionals (ESOMAR) Conference 2002. Marketing activity outcomes must be gathered on a continuous basis in time. While a single reading may provide some insight into the condition before marketing begins, accountability comes from understanding cause and effect. This knowledge comes from repeated examinations over time that show changes from marketing initiatives (from brand and competition) and the evolution of consumers‚Äô needs. Harold Geneen in his groundbreaking book ‚ÄúManaging‚Äù explains the role of an effective CEO: to repeatedly evaluate performance numbers on a continuous basis. Only long term observation brings true insight of unanticipated changes and ‚Äúred flags‚Äù in the data.Geneen, Harold; Moscow, Alvin, Managing, Doubleday and Company Inc., 1984. All measurement systems are prone to misinterpretation and error. Together these form the science of metrology. Measurement accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility, bias, data shifts, and data drifts are only a few common issues identified in measurement, and any useful system must be evaluated from the technical point of view to assure that it addresses these criteria. It is essential that measurement error is quantified so that managers react to changes in conditions, but not changes due to measurement variation. At the very least, all measurements need to show statistical confidence intervals or so-called ‚Äúerror bars‚Äù.Efron, Bradley; Tibshirani, Robert J., An Introduction to the Bootstrap, Chapman & Hall/CRC, 1998. Independent organizations like the Advertising Research Foundation evaluate the validity of commonly used measurement systems.Cook, Dr. William A., ‚ÄúAn (Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) Research Review of Integration Marketing & Communications Limited‚Äôs Market ContactAudit TM Metrics Significance Assessment Methodology‚Äù, ARF ‚Äì The Research Authority, April 2008. These outcome indicators, representing the condition in the marketplace, are combined with financial data to show efficiency of the marketing process. The financials are inputs: dollars spent for marketing activities. The best and most informative systems use Activity based costing (ABC) that track costs by each marketing activity, rather than traditional cost accounting by salaries, facilities, equipment, and materials.ABC: Kaplan, Robert S., Cooper, Robin, Cost and Effect, Using Integrated Cost Systems to Drive Profitability and Performance, Harvard Business School Press, 1997, . ABC methods have the best fidelity as they show contribution efficiency (Brand Experience/$ spent) of each activity, and they may be summed in desired combinations (or campaigns). Understanding competitors costs and brand experience can lead to benchmarking, a comparison to what is considered the best in class.

Dutch Mills is on a small tributary of the Baron Fork of the Illinois River on Arkansas Highway 59, approximately south of U.S. Route 62 and east of the Oklahoma border. Since Dutch Mills is a small rural community, it receives mail delivery from Lincoln (ZIP code 72744). The population of the Lincoln ZCTA was 4,571U.S. Census Bureau U.S. Census website Fact Sheet for Zip Code Tabulation Area 72744 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, AR-MO Metropolitan Statistical Area.  History  Dutch Mills was originally called Hermannsburg, named after its first documented settler, Johann H. Hermann, a German immigrant and former student at the University of Heidelberg. In the early 1850s, Johann Hermann and his brother, Karl F. Hermann acquired the property of the town, built a mill, laid out the lots, and acquired the rights to a United States post office. The brothers operated the mill, a small store, and both served as Postmaster (Johann in 1856 and Karl in 1859). Multiple German families moved there, following the Hermanns.Lemke, W.J. The Hermanns of Old Hermannsburg. Washington County Historical Society, 1965. Hermannsburg was located at a dangerous crossroads between The North and The South during the American Civil War. Bushwackers from both sides of the conflict regularly pillaged the town and conditions worsened after the Battle of Wilson's Creek. Renegade Missouri Governor Claiborne Jackson and his Confederate militia commandeered the Hermann home in Hermannsburg for the night while on their flight to Texas. Because many German immigrants sided with the Union cause, Southern bushwackers would often target them for robbery and even murder. In December 1862, the last 19 German immigrants who remained in the town, including the Hermann brothers and their families, fled Hermannsburg under the cover of night for the safety of the larger German community in St. Louis. After the Civil War, the name of Hermannsburg was changed to Dutch Mills. The name change was likely intended as subtle insult, or perhaps a statement of indifference, by the English descended residents who didn't care to differentiate between the Germans and the Dutch.  Education  Dutch Mills is located within the Lincoln Consolidated School District. Lincoln High School is its sole high school.

He began his musical studies when he was very young and, by the time he reached his teens, was teaching theory, voice, composition, piano, violin and trumpet, the last of which would become his instrument of choice. Upon entering military service, he formed the \\"Banda de Granaderos\\" (Grenadiers). After his tour of duty, he spent his nights working for various orchestras in Buenos Aires. In 1954, he took a job in Medell√≠n. He, his wife and newborn child lived there for two years, but they became homesick and returned to Buenos Aires, where Roy formed his own orchestra, the \\"Banda de Estrellas\\", which played jazz as well as an array of Latin-American musical styles. In the sixties, he was a featured artist in the band \\"Cafiaspirina\\". It was then that he was first presented as \\"Roy Granata y su Trompeta de Oro\\" (Trumpet of Gold). In 1969, he helped organize the Primer Festival Nacional de la M√∫sica Beat which was held in the theater \\"El Nacional\\" and included most of the best-known bands in Argentina. They were awarded prizes for playing, style and execution by a jury of prominent figures from the public, academic and commercial spheres. At the beginning of the seventies, he traveled to Aruba and decided to stay for a few years. In the later seventies and eighties he was part of several theater orchestras in Buenos Aires, until they replaced the musicians with recordings to save money.

(Patented September 2, 1913). Early uses for the Stanley bottle included flying with the pilots on B-17s during World War II, carrying human organs, transporting bull semen by the cattle industry, and accompanying crews on deep sea explorations. More recently the bottle has been used for cooking noodles and hot dogs, transporting temperature-delicate medicines, and carrying coffee or other hot drinks. Timeline thumb In 1913 William Stanley Jr. created the Stanley bottle as a result of his work with transformers, during which he discovered that a welding process he was using could be used to insulate a vacuum bottle with steel instead of glass. By 1915 William Stanley began mass production of the Stanley bottle. He acquired an empty building, renovated and equipped it with machinery for production of insulated jugs, beverage servers, and desk top decanters. In 1916, William Stanley died at the age of 57.William Stanley, 1858 - 1916 A New York City investment company acquired the operation and hired a mechanical engineer, Harry Badger, as General Manager who continued to invent and develop new products which expanded the product line. In 1921, Landers, Frary & Clark (L.F&C;) of New Britain, Connecticut (a household appliance manufacturer) purchased Stanley Insulating Company and added the Stanley line to their appliance and hardware lines. In 1933, the entire Stanley operation moved from Great Barrington, Massachusetts to L.F&C;'s plant in New Britain, Connecticut. During this time, Harry Badger became Chief Product Research and Manufacturing Engineer and in the following years he continued to develop and add more products to the Stanley line. In 1949 Harry Badger retired and John Eza became Chief Product Research and Manufacturing Engineer. From 1949 to 1965, fifteen new products were added and Stanley containers were now used by airlines, railroads, ocean lines, hospitals and mass feeding institutions. In 1953 the Pint Quart and two Quart bottles were modified to utilize common cups, collars, and stoppers. On March 30, 1961, there was a tender offer to acquire controlling stock of L F & C by J. B. Williams Company, a leading producer of pharmaceuticals. Within six weeks J. B. Williams had ownership of 80% of some 404,000 outstanding shares. In 1965, Aladdin acquired the Universal Stanley Division of the J. B. Williams Company, which made the Stanley thermos bottle in Nashville, Tennessee. All of Stanley's operations were moved to Nashville and by 1966 the first Aladdin Stanley bottles were shipped. In 1968 the insulated cup and threaded stopper were designed and manufactured to provide a reduction in manufacturing costs and operating equipment. In 1976, a shorter two-quart Stanley bottle was introduced. In 1988 the bail handle was replaced by a side handle. In the mid 1980s a side handle also was introduced in the one-quart bottle. During this time the 24oz wide mouth bottle with an insulated cup was also produced. In 2002, Stanley was purchased by Seattle, WA based Pacific Market International (PMI).

He is the subject of a documentary 'Poland's Turbulent Priest', shown on BBC World News in 2009, about his struggle with the communist regime and the Polish church.'POLAND'S TURBULENT PRIEST' BBC World News.In the spotlight: Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski Warsaw Business Journal, 5 June 2006.  Life  Isakowicz-Zaleski was born in Krakow to a Polish father and an Armenian mother. Since high school years he was engaged in several Roman Catholic youth organizations. After graduating, he entered a seminary in his native city, which did not prevent him from being called for service in the Polish Army. He served in the years 1975-1977 in Brzeg. In the late 1970s, after returning to the seminary, he joined the anticommunist student movements, such as Student Committee of Solidarity. He co-published a Samizdat magazine Cross of Nowa Huta, also in 1977 he debuted in Tygodnik Powszechny with his poems. In 1980, Isakowicz-Zaleski became engaged in the Solidarity movement; three years later he was ordained and chosen to continue studies at the Papal Armenian Collegium in Rome. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to leave Communist Poland, because of his underground activities. Isakowicz- Zaleski began working in Krakow‚Äôs district of Nowa Huta, where he celebrated Mass for the workers and for the fatherland in the Maximilian Kolbe parish in Mistrzejowice. Throughout the 1980s, he was repressed, and the Communist secret service agents twice brutally beat him. Both incidents happened in 1985, and came in the wake of the notorious 1984 murder of fellow Solidarity priest Jerzy Popie≈Çuszko. The first attack occurred in April at his mother's home, where after gaging him the agents burned a V sign ‚Äì the victory sign of the outlawed Solidarity trade union which he supported ‚Äì on his chest with a cigarette.Priest Leads Push to Expose Clergy Washington Post, 11 January 2007AN END TO THE LIES: The Polish Church's Secret Past Der Spiegel, 16 January 2007 Later in December of the year, he was attacked again, this time at his presbytery. His ordeal was later used by Polish director Maciej Gawlikowski in his 2006 film To Intimidate the Priest. In 1988, as a priest of the workers, he participated in the strike in Nowa Huta‚Äôs Lenin Steel Mill. At the same time, he began helping the poor and the handicapped, together with nuns from local convents. In 1987, he co-founded charitable Foundation of Brother Albert Chmielowski. He remained director of the Foundation, which owns a shelter in the village of Radwanowice in the suburbs of Krakow. In 2006, after months of research at Institute of National Remembrance, he drafted a book on the collaboration between Catholic priests and government agents. But Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz of Krak√≥w denied him the permission to publish it, unless it is vetted in advance by archdiocesan officials. On 3 May 2006, Father Zaleski was awarded one of Poland's highest Orders, the Polonia Restituta (Order of Polish Rebirth) by President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski. In November 2006, he received an apology from the nation's Catholic primate, Cardinal J√≥zef Glemp of Warsaw, for earlier criticizing his research into collaboration between the clergy and the Communist-era secret police./index.cfm?recnum=47667 Controversial Polish priest receives cardinal's apology for criticism Catholic World News (CWN), 15 November 2006. In February 2007 he finally published his controversial book, \\"Ksieza wobec bezpieki na przykladzie archidiecezji krakowskiej\\" (Polish Priests and the Communist Secret Police) on priests who cooperated with communist secret services.Controversial Book Published cracow- life.com, 28 February 2007.  Activities  = Armenian Community in Poland = Reverend Isakowicz-Zaleski is a pastor of Armenian Catholic parish in Gliwice since 1 December 2009. Between 2001 and 2009 he was the national clergyman and national chaplain of the Armenian community of Poland. He popularizes knowledge about the history and culture of Armenia itself, as well as about the rich history of the Armenian minority in Poland. He initiated cooperation between older and newer waves of Armenian immigrants. Father Zaleski, who is related to the Catholic Armenian Rite archbishop of Lviv, Izaak Mikolaj Isakowicz, also promotes the erection of a monument in Krakow to commemorate Armenian Genocide. = Charity and Helping the Disabled = In 1997, Archbishop Franciszek Macharski named Zaleski honorary canon of the Krakow Archdiocese in appreciation for his charity-related activities. However, Zaleski, who is known in Krakow for his charity works, resigned from this post in 2006, protesting allegations aimed at him. Together with Janina Ochojska, he was a participant in several humanitarian convoys to such countries as the former Yugoslavia, Albania, Chechnya and Ukraine. In September 2007, Polish Ombudsman awarded him the Order of Pawel Wlodkowic for courage in fighting for basic values and truths, against the opinions of the majority. He was also awarded the Order of the Smile. Since 2007, he has been cooperating with the Gazeta Polska weekly. Isakowicz-Zaleski runs the Brother Albert Foundation.Mimo wszystko. Foundation of Anna Dymna Ks. Isakowicz- Zaleski under the cross dedicated in honor of Poles murdered by the UPA in Korosciatyn = Massacres of Poles in Volhynia = Zaleski, who lost several members of his family in a campaign of ethnic cleansing of Poles in modern Western Ukraine (formerly inside pre-1939 eastern Polish territory), has for years been fighting to commemorate the Polish victims. In 2008 he unsuccessfully appealed to the Government of Poland, stating that it should officially condemn the Volhynian Genocide. He stated that political correctness in Poland makes it impossible to mention these tragic events.Rzeczpospolita daily, Father Zaleski: To restore memory of victims of UPA In 2008 he wrote the book Subdued Genocide in Kresy, in which, among other things, he describes the fate of his family and of the village of Korosciatyn near Monasterzyska (area of Ternopil), which was destroyed by Ukrainian nationalists, and its inhabitants murdered. He frequently criticizes not only members of the Polish Government, together with president Kaczynski, but also Roman Catholic hierarchy, such as Primate Jozef Glemp and Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, claiming that they have neglected sufferings of Poles in Western Ukraine and they do not protest when Ukrainian nationalists are awarded orders.  Lustration of Polish Clergy  In 2005, during the 25th Anniversary Celebrations of Solidarity, Zaleski was tipped off that there was a pre-1989 secret police file on him in Krakow. By then, under new Polish law, one could view one's own file, as well as those who informed on you. He sought permission from the IPN (Institute of National Remembrance) to study the documents. Subsequently he found some five hundred pages of material on himself alone, names of fellow priests who had allegedly spied on him, and also a video of himself being gagged and beaten by thugs. He was swiftly able to identity several clergymen who had informed on him. Most crucially, evidence suggested that four figures who had risen to bishop status by 2005 were themselves past informers.Spy Storm Swells NH - Cracow Life, 9 January 2006. In February 2006, Zaleski came up with the idea of revealing the names of priests from the Archdiocese of Krak√≥w who had been secret informers of the Communist secret service. As he himself had been victimized by Communist agents, he obtained access to his files, kept by the Institute of National Remembrance, as an injured party. Thus, he appealed publicly for all the priests who had served as secret agents for the Security Service to step forward and reveal themselves, causing a furor. In August of the same year, Zaleski revealed that he had sent letters to priests registered as secret collaborators.Warsaw Voice, Vetting Controversy His activities were harshly criticized by the Krakow Curia and Zaleski received an order from his superiors to refrain from making public statements about this subject. Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz stated that Isakowicz-Zaleski had received a permit to conduct research exclusively into the repression that he himself faced under communism. Dziwisz condemned his \\"irresponsible and harmful\\" activities in a public letter, warned him to stop \\"throwing accusations\\", and finally ordered him to be silentAn Archbishop Falls to a Witch-hunt TIME.The Entity: Five Centuries of Secret Vatican Espionage, by Eric Frattini, tr. Dick Cluster St. Martin's Press, 2008. . Page 364. Eventually Dziwisz gave his permission for Zaleski to notify the clergymen before he identified them and allowed them to comment. Nevertheless, Zaleski persisted saying that the church \\"must repent for the misdeeds of compromised priests\\". He told the Wprost Weekly, that in the fall of 2006 he was in a personal crisis and considered resigning from the priesthood. His research in the secret police files showed that 39 Krakow priests had collaborated with the regime. Four of them were now bishops. \\"The whole tragedy is that the church had 16 years to take care of the problem, and it didn't do a thing\\", stated Zaleski, adding that the Church \\"didn't want to hurt the pope, but actually, more harm was done by keeping silent\\".Polish priest's spy revelations gagged by Canon Law By Maciej Psyk of the Polish Rationalist Association. On 28 February 2007, Znak publishing house issued Zaleski‚Äôs book Ksieza wobec bezpieki na przykladzie diecezji krakowskiej (Polish Priests and the Communist Secret Police, ), in which he addressed the topic of the extent to which Poland‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church was infiltrated by communist security.Znak Publishers In November, Zaleski was awarded the Prize of Jozef Mackiewicz. The book sparked huge public attention, with people signing up at bookstores to make sure they would get a copy. Zaleski decided to donate the royalties to charity.

In early years, it was mainly a learned society, which aimed to promote the use of Finnish language in the engineering profession dominated by the Swedish language. During the World War I, the activities of the association widened into wider sphere of Engineering and Economics. In 1936, the association differentiated itself from the engineers and technicians who had graduated from polytechnics, and started to require a master's degree in engineering () of its members. This was signalled also in the name Suomen teknillinen seura (Finnish technological society), which excluded technicians. The World War II brought about inflation which severely affected the middle classes earning fixed salaries. Little by little, the association increased its activities as the lobbying body of the engineering profession, starting to offer continuing education and pursuing studies on the social and economic standing of its membership. In 1972, the Finnish-speaking STS and its Swedish- speaking counterpart Tekniska f√∂reningen i Finland (TFiF) formed a common trade union KAL, which started to negotiate collectively with the employers as a full-scale trade union. In 1978, the KAL started to insure its members against unemployment and in 1984, the Finnish Association of Mathematicians and Physicists (SMFL) gave the KAL a mandate to negotiate on its behalf. The present structure of the association was formed in 1993, as the KAL and the STS, which had been in close cooperation for two decades, converged into the TEK.TEK. Historia. Retrieved 5-11-2008.

In the private sector, the YTN (Negotiating organization of the upper-level salaried employees) is the body responsible for the collective agreements of university-educated staff. Although rather moderate in its bargaining, the YTN went to strike in 2007 when the collective negotiations in the industrial design bureau branch broke up. The strike included some 6,000 engineers and scientists and lasted 11 days, resulting in a slightly better collective agreement than had been offered earlier by the employers.Suunnittelualalla alkoi aamulla lakko.

Viewed on television and the Internet by millions of people around the globe, Obama's speech focused on the major issues facing the United States and the world, all echoed through his campaign slogan of change. He also mentioned his maternal grandmother Madelyn Dunham, who had died just two nights earlier. References in the speech Crowd at Grant Park during Obama's speech The speech heavily referenced the inaugural addresses of former presidents John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln, and also referred to speeches of Martin Luther King Jr.Obama's victory speech: What happened 221 years ago? Echoing Martin Luther King's \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\" address, he declared, \\"But tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America\\" and \\"The road ahead will be long, our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year, or even in one term‚Äîbut America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there.\\" At another point in the speech he again referenced King when referring to the \\"arc of history\\", a phrase King used regularly, most notably after the Selma to Montgomery marches, saying \\"the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice\\". Obama directly quoted Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address, by saying \\"As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, we are not enemies but friends. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.\\" Obama also referred to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address by saying \\"...that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth\\" Obama proclaimed, \\"It's been a long time coming, but ... change has come to America\\", an allusion to the Sam Cooke song \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\".

The meaning of the privatization is reducing the share and level of intervening which is directly connected with the Israeli government in the Israeli economy, increasing the portion and the economic activity of a private group, on the control and ownership of the assets. The opposite process is nationalization.  Privatization processes  The privatization processes in Israel intensified in 1986 following the intensified privatization in Britain in the 1980s. So far around 90 government companies and subsidiaries have been privatized in Israel, which produced for the country, between the years 1991 and 2003 ‚Äì a revenue amount of 8,749 million U.S. dollars. The privatization processes in Israel belong mainly to the following types: * Gradual Sale: a gradual sale or dilution of the state‚Äôs holdings in the public body to the extent where the state would no longer have a significant holding of the body. A notable example for this is the gradual selling of the Israeli telecommunications provider \\"Bezeq\\" and the gradual selling of the Israeli banks, which were originally nationalized following the Israeli Bank stock crisis in 1983. * One-time sale: A one-time sales or issuing all of the company‚Äôs shares in the stock exchange. This is the method of action which is most common amongst the smaller companies or when there is a single buyer. * Franchises and Licenses: initiating privatization processes by means of outsourcing, transferring of franchise, privileges, etc., especially of certain services which are consumed by government bodies. Such an action is not considered privatization by the definition of the Israeli government. * Disassembly: the disassembly of a governmental body completely due to lack of need of its existence or losses which were made due to the existence of a competitive market. Many refer to the structural change which has happened in many of the kibbutzim in Israel \\"privatization of the kibbutzim\\", although this process does not in relate to privatization processes. The kibbutz is a private voluntary association and not a public association, and the changes which occur in it are not considered Privatization as it is described in this article.  Public sector  The origin of the companies, like the rest of the components of the public sector in Israel, started in the period of the Yishuv, which evolved in parallel with the state. The structure of the Israeli public sector was designed during the pre-state period, a period in which the national institutions were established, which were designed in a large extent continued to operate and become a major part even after the establishment of the state. Through the years, reciprocal ties and cooperation was formed between the public sector and the private sector. These patterns were manifested with the establishment of joint businesses, along with various cases of transition from the private sector to the public sector and from the public sector to the private sector. The various parts of the public sectors recognized the economic importance of their activities, and it is difficult to distinguish between the political motives and considerations and economic considerations. The two were, and would continue to be interwoven with each other. = Components of the public sector in Israel = * The World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency for Israel * The Histadrut * Cabinet of Israel After the state of Israel was founded and the cabinet was established, many dominant institutions which were formed beforehand were transferred to its possession as an \\"inheritance\\". The Israeli government like many other governments acts and intervenes in the economy of the state in order to realize major aims such as: ensuring competition, providing public goods, ensuring the existence of information and preventing restrictions on the ability of the public to choose, ensuring the stability, growth and aid in low point periods and in times of crises. The public sector in Israel contains in it many non-governmental organizations, and the entirety of the organizations is not only a source of budgetary revenue, but also a source of expenditures. The flow of finance from various sources expands the boundaries of the public sector and adds an important dimension to the Israeli political economy. The activities of the public sector are measured to a large extent by the public consumption. A reduction or increase in the consumption reflects the involvement extent of the state in the Israeli economy. The extent of involvement might derive from the security expenditures made by the state and the expenditures made on immigrant absorption.  Implications of privatization  The privatization in Israel consists of ideological problems. The ruling between neo-liberal perceptions or social democratic welfare state perceptions, which are both opposite economic and social perceptions. Arguments in favor of privatization: * Reducing government spending * Promoting competition * Maintaining a strong economy * Increasing efficiency and making services cheaper. The supporters of privatization in Israel claim that reducing the state's involvement increases the involvement of individuals. Thus, promoting competition, encouraging investment, having a strong economy and reducing the state expenses‚Äîwhich would lead to cheaper services. Arguments against privatization: * The transferring of the capital monopoly into the hands of a small group of wealthy private owners. * It would harm the employees. * It would harm the effectiveness. * Losses of the government. * It doesn't always necessarily increase efficiency * Making the manpower cheaper and reducing it. * It would harm the recipients of the services. The opponents of privatization in Israel argue that companies would also be able to be effective under government ownership. Privatization affects employees and leads to the dischargment of employs, leads the workers to choose to get early pension and salary cutbacks. The Israeli economy is gradually becoming controlled by a small number of rich families. The privatization of public services affects the public and especially the poor population, which are the main consumers. One of the main goals of the state is to take care of its citizens, people‚Äôs security, people‚Äôs education, to the profitability and to the preservation of the social community. A state which disclaims those responsibilities violates its own principles. The method which has become customary in Israel in the last decades is selling the control of the public assets into the hands of capital owners, while other countries rather choose to issue the company shares to the public and company employees.

Garth is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is situated next to HMP Wymott. History Garth Prison was opened in October 1988, and a new residential unit (housing 120 prisoners) opened on 2 July 1997. In 1998, inmates put out a contract on a police dog called Scooby because of its track record in locating illegal drugs at the jail, requiring home security measures and, once, armed police. In January 2004, one of Garth's prison chaplains resigned over allegations that she had an affair with a prisoner who worked as a cleaner in the prison chapel. In September 2006 a prison officer from Garth was jailed after it emerged that she had smuggled pills and a mobile phone to an inmate she was having an affair with at the prison. In August 2007, a report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons praised Garth stating that it was \\"an essentially safe, respectful prison, with an increased focus on resettlement.\\" However the report also criticised the prison for its race relations and overcrowded accommodation. The prison has since then experienced severe decline. See The prison today. Further accommodation of 180 places was built at Garth Prison in late 2007 and is notable for being the first prison building to incorporate Interseasonal Heat Transfer. The prison today Garth Prison accepts category B prisoners serving sentences of four years or more. Garth does not accept vulnerable prisoners. Chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke reported that Garth prison has declined severely during the three years up to 2017. Garth holds 800 male prisoners mostly convicted of serious violent or sexual offences. Garth prison was found to be extremely violent, inspectors said it was the most violent prison they had come across and two-thirds of inmates told inspectors they felt unsafe. There is a big problem with illegal drugs and illegally brewed alcohol, 'hooch'. Many violent incidents are related to drugs, debt and gangs. Many prisoners refuse to leave their cells due to a tense, occasionally threatening atmosphere in the wings. Roughly 85 prisoners additionally to sex offenders are held separately due to fears over their safety. Peter Clarke said, \\"The prison was one of the most unsafe we have been to in recent times. Violence and drugs dominated the prisoner experience. A new governor and deputy governor were appointed immediately.\\" Conditions at Garth are not exceptional and other prisons are also problematic, a delegation from the European committee for the prevention of torture reported. ¬£40,000 worth of drugs discovered at 'unsafe' Lancashire prison The Guardian Garth provides a range of training, learning and employment opportunities. Programmes on offer include woodwork, motor mechanics, industrial cleaning and light engineering. The prison also offers NVQs in horticulture and textiles, as well as electrical, mechanical and community workshops. A number of basic skills courses are also offered including literacy, numeracy and ESOL. The prison's gym also offers physical education including a YMCA Gym Instructor qualification, as well as recreational gym.

Mackay (May 17, 1889 ‚Äì June 9, 1983) was a Presbyterian theologian, missionary, and educator. He was a strong advocate of the Ecumenical Movement and World Christianity. Early life and education John A. Mackay was born on May 17, 1889 in Inverness, Scotland, the eldest of five children. The family attended the Free Presbyterian Church, a very small denomination. At the age of 14 at a communion service at Rogart, Scotland, Mackay had a profound religious experience that influenced the remainder of his life.Mackay, God's Order, (1953), 6‚Äì8 As a youth he attended the Inverness Royal Academy where he was a good student, winning several academic prizes upon graduation in 1907. Mackay then studied philosophy and logic at the University of Aberdeen, leaving for a time to pursue theological studies for the Free Presbyterian Church ministry. He returned to Aberdeen to complete his honors degree which he received in 1913. That same year Mackay crossed the Atlantic and enrolled at Princeton Theological Seminary. When he was graduated in 1915, he won a fellowship in didactic and polemic theology, which he used toward studies in Spanish culture at Madrid, Spain, to prepare for missionary work in Latin America.John A. Mackay: Influences on My Life, Journal of Presbyterian History, vol. 56, no. 1 (Spring 1978), 28. Mission Field In 1916 Mackay and Jane Logan Wells, who had been recently married, sailed to Peru where they founded a school, Colegio Anglo Peruano, in Lima, Peru, under the auspices of the Free Church of Scotland.The school's name was later changed to Colegio San Andres The school was a center for progressive ideas during a period when social and educational reforms were sweeping through Latin America. Haya de la Torre, a political leader in Latin America, taught at the school. The mission also started a mission station at Cajamarca in the northern Peru. From his position as school master, Mackay entered intellectual circles and became a member of a literary group that included Victor Andres Belaunde, Professor of Philosophy at San Marcos University. Francisco Garcia Calderon Rey and his brother, Ventura, were the group's European correspondents. Five members were corresponding members of the Spanish Academy. In 1925 Mackay was appointed to the Chair of Modern Philosophy at San Marcos and also accepted the chair in Metaphysics.H. McKennie Goodpasture, \\"The Latin American Soul of John A. Mackay,\\" Journal of Presbyterian History, vol. 48, no. 4 (Winter, 1970), 273. In 1926 the Colegio was sufficiently rooted to survive without his leadership. Mackay joined the Y.M.C.A. as an evangelist and religious teacher moving his family to Montevideo, Uruguay, where the Y.M.C.A. operated a leadership institute. During the next seven and one-half years, he traveled widely through Chile, Brazil, and Argentina as an evangelistic speaker. He attended the Jerusalem Conference of 1928 and traveled extensively in Europe during his furlough in 1930. From April to July 1930 Mackay and his family lived in Bonn, Germany where he attended the lectures of Karl Barth and began a friendship with him. Under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A. Mackay made many significant addresses in Mexico during the revolutionary period of religious persecution, including an address to over 2,000 men and women in the largest theatre in the town of Chihuahua. Over the years he was invited to speak at 35 Latin American universities. North American educator In 1936, Mackay reluctantly left the foreign mission field to become the third President of Princeton Theological Seminary which had recently been weakened by the secession of several professors, including his own former teacher, J. Gresham Machen. For the next 24 years as both President and Professor of Ecumenics, Mackay worked on many fronts to revive the institution's health, inspiring it to evangelical dynamism and leaving it on a sound footing, with expanded faculty, student body, and campus plant.Henry Snyder Gehman, \\"John Alexander Mackay: As President,\\" Princeton Seminary Bulletin, vol. 52, no. 4 (May 1959), 3‚Äì14. In 1944, Mackay founded the journal Theology Today to provide insights \\"into the life of man in the light of God\\". The editorial board included Robert Elliott Speer, Richard Niebuhr, and J. Harvey Cotton. By 1952 Theology Today was the most widely distributed religious quarterly in the world. After retirement from the Seminary, he served from 1961‚Äì1964 as Adjunct Professor of Hispanic Thought at American University, Washington, D.C. Church leader An eloquent and charismatic platform speaker and preacher, Mackay was often called upon to present keynote addresses at conferences, assemblies, and gatherings. As the holder of leadership roles in church organizations, his constituency included tens of millions of Christians. Five leadership roles were particularly significant, the Presidency of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions from 1944‚Äì1951, after which he continued serving as a member of the Mission Board; membership on the Provisional Committee of the World Council of Churches in 1946 and from 1948 membership on the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches; the Chairmanship of the International Missionary Council from January 1, 1948 to 1958; membership on the Executive Committee of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and from 1954 the Presidency of its Executive Committee; and Moderator of the 165th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, USA, 1953‚Äì1954.\\"Memorial Minute,\\" Theology Today, vol. 40, no. 4 (January, 1984), 454. These leadership roles gave Mackay platforms that enhanced his spiritual influence and authority. In addition to writing the influential \\"Letter to Presbyterians\\", which fortified resistance to McCarthyism in the United States, Mackay was also the primary draftsman of a number of other church statements and messages on behalf of various ecclesiastical councils and conferences.James H. Smylie, \\"Mackay and McCarthyism, 1953‚Äì1954,\\" Journal of Church and State, vol. 6, no. 3 (Autumn 1964), 352‚Äì365. Although known primarily for his mission work in Latin America, Mackay worked to advance World Christianity through travels and at conferences in Asia, Europe, and Africa. These included the Eastern Asia Christian Conference in Bangkok in 1949, the Asia Study Conference in Lucknow, India in 1952, the All Africa Church Conference, Ibadan, Nigeria, 1958, and the Joseph Cook Lectureship which took him around the world during, 1960‚Äì1961. Thus, as a fellow Presbyterian leader correctly concluded, Mackay exerted influential leadership in three broad areas: Missions, the Ecumenical Movement, and social and political thought and action.Eugene C. Blake, \\"John Alexander Mackay, An Appreciation,\\" Reformed and Presbyterian World, vol. 25, no. 6 (June 1959), 247. Missionary and ecumenical ideas Mackay strongly emphasized sensitivity to and experience of the reality of God in Christ and authentic conscious experience of life in Christian community. Frequently asked to preach, his sermons called for response on the part of his hearers. Mackay wrote devotional literature in English and Spanish. He believed in a personal and incarnational approach to foreign missions by which the missionary would become a member of the community and earn the right to be heard through particular service that met specific needs within the receiving culture. These might include the demonstration of authentic Christianity in action through educational, medical, or agricultural service. This gift of service offered a platform through which the missionary could effectively proclaim the faith that he held. At the Oxford Conference on Church and State in 1937, Mackay coined the phrase that became the byword of the conference, \\"Let the Church be the Church.\\" He yearned for the Church \\"to become in its historical existence the dynamic instrument of God's will, which it actually was in its eternal essence,\\"Mackay, Ecumenics (1964), 5‚Äì6. He influenced historical development within the ecumenical movement by his strong advocacy, as at the Central Committee meeting of the World Council of Churches at Rolle in August, 1951.Henry P. Van Dusen, \\"Christian Missions and Christian Unity,\\" Theology Today, vol. 16, no. 3 (October, 1959), 324‚Äì325. For him \\"the church is the fellowship of those for whom Jesus Christ is Lord.\\"Mackay, \\"Let Us Remember,\\" Princeton Seminary Bulletin, vol. 65, no. 1 (July, 1972), 28. He believed the Church was truly the Church when it was a missionary Church, and he worked to bring into balance the Church universal, the Una Sancta, with confessional movements within various faith traditions. Mackay advocated visible unity of the Church. His high Christology also stressed a unity of spirit with a diversity of treasures from the various Christian traditions. In this way Mackay helped to lay the foundation for spiritual ecumenism among fellow Christians across denominational lines. Travelling in Chile in 1965 Mackay agreed with Fr. Juan Ochagaria, dean of the Catholic University of Chile's faculty of theology, that the task of both Catholics and Presbyterians is to \\"make Christians.\\"Mackay, \\"The New Mood in the Churches,\\" Christian Century, (November 24, 1965), 1441. In 1964 in Lima, Mackay was presented with the Palmas Magisteriales, a civic honor and the highest government award for educational services to Peru. In his final years Mackay moved to a Presbyterian retirement community in Hightstown, New Jersey, and died early on June 9, 1983. Coincidentally, the General Assembly of his denomination voted to join the Southern Presbyterian Church later that same morning. It would have pleased Mackay because he had worked for many years for the reunion of the Northern and Southern Presbyterian Churches. Each of the Mackays' three daughters married Presbyterian clergyman, and their son, Duncan Alexander Duff Mackay, named for the Scottish Free Church missionary to India, Alexander Duff (missionary), was an active layman and elder, while working for the U.S. Foreign Service and later the Inter-American Development Bank.

Its campus is very close to the River Severn and lies on the border of the Wyre Forest national nature reserve. The school is an educational research partner of the University of Worcester and University of Birmingham and is recognised for its focus on international and cultural education, and hosted the 2019 Global Happiness Conference in partnership with the British Council. . History The school has its origins in The Bewdley Grammar School on Lax Lane, which closed in the 1800s. The former grammar school is now home to a yoga studio and the Bewdley brewery. After the closure of Bewdley Grammar School, Bewdley County Secondary School was built on the opposite side of the river in 1956 with new buildings. In 1972, the area adopted a three-tier system, and the school became Bewdley High School. When the area returned to a two-tier system in 2007, the High School was amalgamated with the two local middle schools to form The Bewdley School as a new secondary school, following extensive building work and landscaping, with new facilities for the arts, science, humanities and outdoor learning. = Headteachers = Charles Goodyear 1955-1968 Jack Harris 1968-1987 Margaret Griffiths 1987-2002 David Derbyshire 2002-2007 Julie Reilly 2007-2016 David Hadley-Pryce 2016-present Present day The Bewdley School Entrance =Bewdley Sixth Form= Bewdley Sixth Form is also part of The Bewdley School, offering GCSE, BTEC and A-Level courses. The sixth form is growing yearly, and in 2018 was the largest Sixth Form in the Wyre Forest District. Bewdley Sixth Form is consistently high performing at A-Level, with students often gaining places at top Russell Group UK universities. =Partnerships= The school is partnered with the University of Worcester for teacher training and further educational research. The University of Birmingham's School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences works closely with The Bewdley School through their ongoing Encompass project. In September 2009, The Bewdley School gained Specialist Art college status via accreditation from Arts Council England. This specialism was later awarded the Arts Mark Gold Award for excellent practice amongst the department. =Results= In 2019, the school achieved 72% of students achieving 5+ GCSE's including English at Maths at grade 4 or above. At Bewdley Sixth Form, 20 of the 21 subjects achieved 100% pass rates at A-Level with 96% of university applicants being successful. The Bewdley School - Arts & Technology The school was inspected by Ofsted in September 2019 under their new framework, and found the school to be consistently Good. The school has held a 'Good' rating from Ofsted since 2012. =House System= The school has three distinct student houses, each made up of two tutor groups each. The houses were named after historical connections to the town of Bewdley. Baldwin - Named after Stanley Baldwin, three times Prime Minister. Stanley Baldwin, as Member of Parliament for Bewdley, is the only British premier to have served under three monarchs (George V, Edward VIII, and George VI). Ribbesford - Named after Ribbesford House. The estate dates from the 11th century (Anglo-Saxon Charter). In 1074 the estate was presented to Ralph de Mortimer in recognition of his services to William of Normandy. It remained in the Mortimer family for many centuries. Severn - Named after the River Severn. The river is about 220 miles long and is considered to be the longest in the United Kingdom. It rises from the Welsh mountains to the Atlantic Ocean at Bristol and it has historically been a route for trade and central to the growth of Bewdley as a market town over the last 500 years. =Awards= In May 2019, The school was nominated for Secondary School of the Year in the county of Worcesterhire, and was announced as a finalist alongside Bishop Perowne Church of England College, St Augustine's High School, Redditch and Bowbrook House School.

He won seven caps for Wales and captained his country in their victory over the 1947 touring Australian team. Two of his brothers, Tom and Ewart, also played first class rugby but they never represented their country. Rugby career Tamplin first played club rugby for smaller second class clubs before joining Pontypool and then in 1939, Newport. Rugby was suspended for the duration of World War II and after the end of hostilities Tamplin joined Cardiff. Tamplin was selected to represent his country late in his rugby career when he was chosen to play, in the 1947 Five Nations Championship. Although missing the opening game against England, Tamplin was selected for the remaining three games of the tournament. His first cap was against Scotland, under the captaincy of Haydn Tanner. Wales enjoyed a high scoring victory, and Tamplin himself scored two conversions and a penalty goal. Tamplin also scored in the next two games of the Championship, with the winning penalty goal against France, and a conversion in the Irish match. In December 1947 Tamplin was not only selected to play for Wales but would captain his country against the touring Australian in 1947. When Tamplin was selected to face Australia, he was still a Cardiff player, and as well as leading the Welsh team he also scored all the points in a victory over the Australians after two successful penalty kicks. In the 1948 Five Nations Championship, Tamplin played in three games, drawing against England, beating Scotland, but most importantly, losing on home soil to France. France were at the time the weakest team in the tournament, and had failed to win in Wales on nine successive occasions. It would be Tamplin's final international game.

The B side was \\"Tossin' and Turnin',\\" recorded at the same session.

Rationale PMAP is to aid the protease researchers in reasoning about proteolytic networks and metabolic pathways. History and funding PMAP was originally created at the Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, California. In 2004 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) selected a team led by Jeffrey W. Smith, to establish the Center on Proteolytic Pathways (CPP). As part of the NIH Roadmap for Biomedical research, the center develops technology to study the behavior of proteins and to disburse that knowledge to the scientific community at large. Focal point Proteases are a class of enzymes that regulate much of what happens in the human body, both inside the cell and out, by cleaving peptide bonds in proteins. Through this activity, they govern the four essential cell functions: differentiation, motility, division and cell death ‚Äî and activate important extracellular episodes, such as the biochemical cascade effect in blood clotting. Simply stated, life could not exist without them. Extensive on-line classification system for proteases (also referred as peptidases) is deposited in the MEROPS database. The goal Proteolytic pathways, or proteolysis, are the series of events controlled by proteases that occur in response to specific stimuli. In addition to the clotting of blood, the production of insulin can be viewed as a proteolytic pathway, as the activation, regulation and inhibition of that protein is the result of proteases reacting to changing glucose levels and triggering other proteases downstream. Database content PMAP integrates five databases. ProteaseDB and SubstrateDB, are driven by an automated annotation pipeline that generates dynamic ‚ÄòMolecule Pages‚Äô, rich in molecular information. CutDBIgarashi Y, Eroshkin A, Gramatikova S, Gramatikoff K, Zhang Y, Smith JW, Osterman AL, Godzik A. CutDB: a proteolytic event database. Nucleic Acids Research. 2007 D546-9 has information on more than 6,600 proteolytic events, and ProfileDB is dedicated to information of the substrate recognition specificity of proteases. PathwayDB, just begun accumulation of metabolic pathways whose function can be dynamically modeled in a rule-based manner. Hypothetical networks are inferred by semi-automated culling from the literature. Additionally, protease software tools are available for the analysis of individual proteases and proteome-wide data sets. Usage Popular destinations in PMAP are Protease Molecule Pages and Substrate Molecule Pages. Protease Molecule Pages show recent news in PubMed literature of the protease, known proteolytic events, protein domain location and protein structure view, as well as a cross annotation in other bioinformatic databases section. Substrate Molecule Pages display protein domains and experimentally derived protease cut-sites for a given protein target of interest.

Academic He was born in Mansfield.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51131 He was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he became Fellow in 1607. His pupils at Christ's included John Lightfoot, Henry More, John Shawe,:s:Shaw, John (1608-1672) (DNB00) and John Milton. In Milton's case, friction with Chappell may have caused him to leave the college temporarily (a rustication) in 1626.http://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~creamer/milton/chronology.html Another explanation is that plague caused an absence, and that Milton's Elegy I has been over-interpreted.Richard Bradford, The Complete Critical Guide to John Milton: A Sourcebook (2001), p. 13. He shared Chappell as tutor with Edward King ‚Äì his Lycidas ‚Äì and it is thought that Damoetas in the poem refers to Chappell (or possibly Joseph Mede).William Bridges Hunter, A Milton Encyclopedia: A-B V. 1 (1978), p. 45.Thomas N. Corns, A Companion to Milton (2003), p. 253. On his return, Milton was taught by Nathaniel Tovey. Despite the personal problems, Milton may have learned from Chappell, who was a theoretician of preaching; this aspect of Milton is discussed in Jameela Lares, Milton and the Preaching Arts (2001). She suggests Andreas Hyperius, and his De formandis concionibus sacris (1553), as influential on Chappell and other writers on preaching and sermon types. Chappell was himself a pupil of William Ames, who left Christ's in 1610. Like Ames, he was a Ramist,http://www.apuritansmind.com/William%20Ames/VlietMoralTheologyAmes.htm though he differed from the Calvinist Ames on doctrine. Chappell was an Arminian, with strong anti-predestinarian beliefs. Lares argues for Chappell as the link to the older Christ's preaching tradition, Milton connected back to William Perkins.Albert C. Labriola, Milton Studies (2004), p. 102. In any case, Chappell had a reputation then for strictness, and for being a hard man in a Latin disputation. Stories gathered about him: John Aubrey, an unreliable source, suggested Chappell had beaten Milton.http://www.nndb.com/people/017/000084762/Donald Lemen Clark, John Milton and William Chappell, The Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 18, No. 4 (Aug. 1955), pp. 329‚Äì350.

The anonymous The Whole Duty of Man (1658) has been attributed to Chappell,http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/mansfieldchurches/mansfieldwoodhouse1.htm though modern opinion suggests Richard Allestree.

Marcy and his men constructed a rectangular fort, with barracks on opposite sides and the quartermaster and commissary facilities at opposite ends. Eventually the fort consisted of thirty buildings constructed of hewn logs, with stone chimneys. Major William H. Emory of the First Cavalry was appointed commander of both Fort Arbuckle and Fort Washita in 1858. He found the facilities at the fort inadequate. Many of the buildings were in a poor state of repair; ordnance stores were depleted; and surplus ammunition and gunpowder had to be buried in order to be weather protected. But before the troops could remedy these faults, they received orders to build another fort, this one named Fort Cobb. On May 3, 1861, after the Civil War broke out, Major Emory ordered the three forts under his command to be evacuated, with the troops going to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, which supported the Union. The government of the Chickasaw Nation had already decided to support the Confederacy. Although Fort Arbuckle was briefly occupied by Confederate troops, no battle occurred in the vicinity, and it played no part in the war. After the war, the post was garrisoned by troops from the Sixth Infantry and Tenth Cavalry. The United States began to undertake campaigns against the Plains Indians west of here. In 1868 General Philip Sheridan planned to use Fort Arbuckle as a supply depot for his campaigns against the Comanche. By the following spring, a great store of hay and grain had been brought by the river to Fort Gibson and then by wagon to Fort Arbuckle. Sheridan sent many of his horses to the fort to be fed. Four companies of the Tenth Cavalry came to Fort Arbuckle for this purpose.Morrison, W. B. \\"Fort Arbuckle.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma 6:1 (March 1928) 26-34. Retrieved June 7, 2013.

It originally aired on ABC on 25 February 1966. The episode was directed by Bill Bain and written by Philip Levene. Plot A butler asks for a pay rise and another butler, Benson, is hailed and hands a gun on a plate to a hidden man in a chair to kill the butler, whose body is then dropped in a lake. Steed visits a barber for a shave. His barber reports that one of three high officers is a spy, and is stabbed dead. Steed investigates the disappearance of the butler in disguises that spoof the styles of the various services. Commander Red wears a full beard, and Major White a small mustache. Squadron Leader Blue sports a great bushy mustache and spouts breezy acronyms. Brigadier \\"Percy\\" Ponsonby-Goddard informs Steed he is unwell and asks him to return at a later date. His butler is later discovered stabbed. Mrs Peel visits Group Capt. \\"Georgie\\" Miles, a suspect who is susceptible to a pretty face, to learn more about him. She seduces him with photographs of herself, and is invited to dinner. Steed visits the training academy which the murdered butlers attended and discovers that Hubert Hemming is both head of the academy and under the employ of Miles. Steed enrolls. He polishes shoes, presses trousers, and learns to adhere to their motto, \\"Brighter, Better, More Beautiful Butling\\". He impresses Hemming, but Hemming's own butler Benson is suspicious and knows Steed to be an imposter. Hemming is later working for the absent Miles; Hemming is lured away and killed by Benson, who returns the gun to the hidden man in the chair. He promises to kill Steed, who discovers Hemming's body. Benson holds Steed at gunpoint and informs him that his false references make him trustworthy. Benson sends Steed to butler for Miles, whilst Miles is forcibly attempting to romance Mrs Peel. Later, Steed and several other butlers get instructions to pour wine over Miles and the others attending a private conference. Benson fetches their jackets. Steed and Mrs Peel discover that Benson has hidden recorders in the jackets for his real boss, the hidden man in the chair, now revealed as no high officer at all. He makes the usual villainous mistake of trying to overpower Mrs Peel in hand-to-hand combat, and the cheerful victors fly off in a helicopter.

Other artists he has worked with include Godsmack, Eagle Eye Cherry, Jewel, Big Head Todd & the Monsters, Socialburn, No Address, Hurt, DoubleDrive, Chelsea Bain as well as the Athens southern rock band Tishamingo. The total number of albums sold that Kurzweg has produced is currently over 40 million copies worldwide (over 58 million according to Creed Discography & Puddle of Mudd's Come Clean) and along with these Kurzweg produced and or mixed 12 #1 hit singles at rock radio, eight top 10 rock radio hits and at least four others in the top 50. Creed's debut My Own Prison (which was recorded in Kurzweg's house), and the third album, Weathered were certified multi-platinum and initially sold more than six million copies each - the second, Human Clay was quickly certified diamond (more than 10 million sold). All three Creed albums were recorded in houses instead of studios, and Kurzweg also played keyboards on My Own Prison and Human Clay. Kurzweg produced Puddle of Mudd's debut album Come Clean which sold more than five million copies and included the band's two most well-known songs, \\"Blurry\\" and \\"She Hates Me\\", both of which achieved the #1 spot on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks. Kurzweg also worked on the majority of their follow-up release Life on Display in 2003 as well as two songs from Volume 4: Songs in the Key of Love & Hate. In 2009 Kurzweg produced and mixed Godsmack‚Äôs Whiskey Hangover which hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, and appeared on the deluxe edition of The Oracle. Prior to his success as record producer Kurzweg was a popular musician in the Tallahassee and Jacksonville, Florida, areas, fronting on lead vocals and guitar for bands such as Slapstick, Radio Bikini, Synergy, and John Kurzweg & the Night as well as one-off gigs on drums for Percy Sledge and Chuck Berry and guitar and keyboards for Mike Angelo & the Idols . In the late 1980s Kurzweg signed as a solo artist with Atlantic Records, and released a record in February 1987 under the name John Philip (his middle name). The album, Wait for the Night (which Ken Scott produced/recorded the first half of) received mostly positive reviews and some airplay for a few weeks but then virtually disappeared from the landscape. After this experience Kurzweg started producing other artists, at first mostly in the Florida-Georgia area. In 2003 he moved to New Mexico and from 2006 till 2015 Kurzweg was the lead guitarist for Santa Fe artist Sean Healen and produced/mixed and co-wrote for the Sean Healen Band's 2008 award-winning album Flood Plain.

He entered on a tutorship at Yale in November 1757 and was soon licensed to preach and was settled Congregationalist minister at Turkey Hill, now part of East Granby, Connecticut, 1761-67. His marriage to Lydia Smith proved to be an embarrassment, when after she had been granted a divorce in February 1759 on grounds of abandonment, her husband, Andrew Burr Jr of New Haven, having gone to the West Indies in January 1755, Burr reappeared and her marriage to Nehemiah Strong was necessarily annulled, and as a result of entanglements he was dismissed from his pastorate at Turkey Hill, 23 June 1767.

Thereafter he resided in Newtown, in New Milford, where he kept an academy for boys, and, from 1803 in Bridgeport, giving occasional sermons and teaching to the time of his death. He resigned his chair at Yale in 1781, in a dispute over his salary, exacerbated by the sense on the part of the Corporation that he was not a sufficiently ardent Patriot. He represented Newtown in the Connecticut General Assembly, May 1784. His portrait by Ralph Earl, painted in 1789-90, was presented to Yale by the artist and remains in the University's collection.

It was the sixteenth tropical storm, eighth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. A late-season hurricane, it set several records for its intensity and formation. Paloma was the third most powerful November hurricane on record in the Atlantic Basin, behind only a 1932 hurricane and 1999's Lenny. It also marked the first time that at least one major hurricane formed in every month of the hurricane season from July to November, with only June not having a major hurricane this season. Paloma developed out of a strong tropical disturbance off the eastern coast of Nicaragua and northern coast of Honduras on November 5. The disturbance had slowly developed into a tropical depression while hugging the coastline. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on November 6, then a hurricane later that day. The next day, Paloma intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, then soon afterward into a Category 3 major hurricane. Early on November 8, Paloma continued to intensify and reached Category 4 intensity, and then weakened rapidly into a Category 2 hurricane before making landfall in Santa Cruz del Sur, Cuba. Paloma weakened into a tropical storm on November 9 while moving over Cuba, where it stalled out. It dissipated later that evening. Hurricane Paloma caused heavy damage in both the Cayman Islands and Cuba. Overall, the total damage from Paloma stands at $454.5 million, with one fatality. Meteorological history In early November 2008, an area of disturbed weather persisted over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. By November 2, a surface trough manifested itself, spurring the development of scattered convection ‚Äî shower and thunderstorm activity ‚Äî across the region. A tropical wave approaching from the east interacted with this trough two days later and enhanced convective organization. Steadily consolidating, the system developed into a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC on November 5 while located 130 mi (215 km) southeast of the Nicaragua/Honduras border. Situated along the southwestern edge of a ridge, the depressed initially generally to the north- northwest before turning north-northeast within 12 hours of formation. Favorable environmental conditions, including low wind shear, allowed for steady intensification following cyclogenesis. The HWRF and GFDL forecast models depicted rapid development of the tropical depression into a Category 3 major hurricane within five days, before striking Cuba, the former of which indicated a peak intensity of and 921 mbar (hPa; 27.20 inHg). The system acquired gale-force winds early on November 6, at which time it was assigned the name Paloma. Aided by good upper-level outflow, deep convection blossomed over the storm's circulation. Further development of banding features and eye resulted in Paloma rapidly intensifying into a Category 1 hurricane by 00:00 UTC on November 7. Infrared satellite image of Hurricane Paloma at 10:08 UTC on November 8, shortly before peak intensity The initial phase of rapid intensification temporarily abated on November 7, though slow strengthening continued. Once its eye became defined on visible satellite imagery that evening, rapid strengthening ensued once more. A localized area of high ocean heat content bolstered this phase. Aided by increasing divergence from an approaching upper-level trough, Paloma's outflow greatly enhanced overnight. The aforementioned trough imparted a slightly more northeasterly track on the hurricane. Around 09:00 UTC on November 8, the hurricane skirted Little Cayman as a Category 3 hurricane. Rapid intensification continued through the first half of the day with Paloma reaching Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) around 10:30 UTC, the first such November system since Hurricane Michelle in 2001. Around this time the storm's center passed over Cayman Brac and Little Cayman shortly thereafter. An unofficial anemometer on Cayman Brac at an elevation of measured sustained winds of . Based on data from reconnaissance aircraft, which found flight- level winds , Paloma peaked with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) at 12:00‚Äì18:00 UTC, along with a minimum barometric pressure of 944 mbar (hPa; 27.88 inHg). This ranked the system as the third-strongest November hurricane on record, only behind the 1932 Santa Cruz del Sur hurricane and Hurricane Lenny in 1999. Additionally, this marked the first time that major hurricanes developed in five separate months during a single year, with Bertha, Gustav, Ike, and Omar reaching this strength in July, August, September, and October respectively. At its peak, Paloma displayed a well- defined eye surrounded by intense convection estimated at . Late on November 8, environmental conditions abruptly became hostile as the hurricane approached Cuba. Interaction with land hastened Paloma's weakening with convection diminishing significantly. The northern eyewall moved ashore around 23:00 UTC while the center itself made landfall at 01:00 UTC on November 9 near Santa Cruz del Sur. Upon moving ashore, Paloma was estimated to have had winds of 100 mph (155 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. Within hours of moving ashore, the center of circulation decoupled from the remaining convection and its forward speed slowed significantly. The system subsequently degraded to a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC, just 24 hours after being a Category 4 hurricane. With no convection redeveloping as the system drifted northward over Cuba, Paloma degenerated into a remnant low six hours later. The low then briefly moved over the Atlantic Ocean before doubling back to the southwest in response to a building ridge farther north. The system crossed Cuba again and re-emerged over the Caribbean Sea by November 12, changing direction this time to the west and later northwest. After crossing western Cuba early on November 13, the remnants of Paloma entered the Gulf of Mexico. Accelerating northward the low became decreasingly organized and ultimately dissipated early the next day about 70 mi (110 km) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. Later on November 14, the system moved inland over the Florida Panhandle where a sudden burst of convective development, akin to that of supercell thunderstorms over the Great Plains, took place. Thereafter, energy from Paloma may have contributed to a storm that generated deadly tornado outbreak in The Carolinas on November 15. Preparations =Cayman Islands= Infrared satellite image of Hurricane Paloma at 11:09 UTC on November 7 as it approached the Cayman Islands At 15:00 UTC on November 6, the Government of the Cayman Islands issued a hurricane watch for all of the territory's islands. This was superseded six hours later by a hurricane warning. The warning was eventually discontinued early on November 9 once Paloma cleared the islands. On November 7, the Red Cross opened a shelter for possible evacuees while stocks of emergency supplies were checked. Schools, businesses, and government offices closed for November 8. Shelters opened on Grand Cayman closed their doors by mid-afternoon in advance of Paloma's arrival to \\"ensure that persons get off the roads.\\" At least 40 people sought refuge in these shelters prior to the storm's arrival. The Seaman's Center, a government office building, was utilized as an unofficial shelter during the storm and housed at least 100 people. The Cayman Islands Government requested all hotels to move guests on ground and first floors to higher rooms. As a precautionary measure, water service was turned off during the evening on November 8. The British ship RFA Wave Ruler was sent to Little Cayman and Cayman Brac for humanitarian assistance, on the order of Governor Stuart Jack. =Cuba= The NHC's forecast track of Hurricane Paloma and associated watches/warnings at 15:00 UTC on November 8 Anticipating hurricane conditions to impact portions of eastern Cuba, the nation's government issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Camag√ºey, Ciego de √Åvila, Granma, Las Tunas, and Sancti Sp√≠ritus at 12:00 UTC on November 7. Six hours later, this was upgraded to a hurricane warning except and by the November 8, warnings covered the entirety of eastern Cuba. These advisories were discontinued following Paloma's rapid dissipation over land on November 9. Fearing a \\"potentially catastrophic\\" storm with a storm surge of , officials in Cuba scrambled to evacuate nearly half a million people in southern areas of the country. Coincidentally, Paloma threatened the same area where a devastating hurricane in 1932 killed more than 3,000 people almost exactly 76 years prior. Plans were put in place to evacuate 345,000 in Holgu√≠n, 324,000 in Granma, 250,000 people in Las Tunas, and 200,000 in Camag√ºey. An estimated 3,000 tourists in Ciego de Avila were brought to shelters. Ultimately, an approximate 1.2 million people, 10.7% of Cuba's entire population, were relocated in advance of the storm's arrival. Of these people, 220,000 sought refuge in 1,448 shelters while the rest stayed with relatives. A total of 927 food processing centers and 72 soup kitchens opened to feed evacuees. Roughly 237,000 animals were moved to safer areas. Holgu√≠n Province was devastated by Hurricane Ike in September with many residents still homeless at the time of Paloma's approach. All domestic flights except those around the Isle of Youth. Former President Fidel Castro urged people to remain positive in the face of yet another hurricane that year. He also issued a written statement to the United States rejecting any aid, citing anger toward the ongoing embargo of Cuba, before a formal offer was even made. The non-profit organization Operation USA provided emergency aid to Cuba. =Elsewhere= Following the classification of Tropical Depression Seventeen late on November 5, a tropical storm watch was issued for coastal areas between Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua and Limon, Honduras. This later expired on November 6 as Paloma moved away from the region. Owing to the threat of heavy rains in Honduras, a red alert was issued for Col√≥n, Gracias a Dios, northern Olancho, and the Bay Islands. Although Paloma was not forecast to directly impact Jamaica, officials opened 15 priority shelters in St. James and all agencies were placed under high-alert on November 8. A flash flood warning was in place from November 6‚Äì9 for the entire island. Early on November 8, a tropical storm watch and later tropical storm warning was issued for the Central Bahamas, including Cat Island, Exuma, Long Island, Rum Cay, San Salvador, Crooked Island, Acklins, and Ragged Island. Accordingly, the National Emergency Operations Centre was partially activated. The warning was allowed to expire the following day as Paloma rapidly weakened over Cuba, and the National Emergency Operations Centre issued an all clear on November 10. Impact =Honduras and Nicaragua= Throughout much of October Central America, was plagued by a series of heavy rain events which resulted in widespread damage and loss of life. The outer bands of then Tropical Storm Paloma exacerbated the situation in parts of Honduras and Nicaragua. Estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellites indicated that Paloma dropped upwards of of rain along coastal areas. The overall impacts of flooding since October in Honduras left at least 60 people dead and more than 300,000 in need of assistance. =Cayman Islands= Passing directly over the small islands Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, with a collective population of 2,695, Hurricane Paloma wrought tremendous damage. Grand Cayman escaped almost entirely unscathed. Throughout the Cayman Islands, Paloma was responsible for $154.4 million in losses of which $124.5 million was incurred from damage. This equates to roughly 7.4 percent of the territory's gross domestic product (GDP). While the overall impact to the islands was offset by a lack of damage on Grand Cayman, the localized losses on Cayman Brac and Little Cayman were tremendous. Discounting the economy of Grand Cayman, the equivalent GDP losses on the two smaller islands was likely similar to that of Hurricane Ivan in 2004, which left damage equal to 183 percent of the territory's GDP. The overall per capita impact there reached $57,925. Despite the severity of damage, no loss of life or injuries took place. Destructive winds and torrential rains battered both Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, with an unofficial elevated observation station reporting maximum sustained winds of during the height of the storm. Grand Cayman saw lesser winds, with a peak sustained observation of at Owen Roberts International Airport. Precipitation on Cayman Brac amounted to and on Grand Cayman. A significant storm surge also impacted the islands, reaching on Cayman Brac and on Little Cayman. Destructive winds were the primary cause of damage across Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, where nearly all homes were affected. Cayman Brac sustained the most severe impact, with 71 homes destroyed and 912 damaged. Although all home on Little Cayman were affected, none experienced major damage. Bodden Town was the only district on Grand Cayman reporting damage, with 11 homes affected. Major damage took place at Cayman Brac's seaport. The port's warehouse and office building were destroyed while anchors and moorings were shifted out of position. The island's fire station and Faith Hospital had major roof damage, with the latter resulting in significant water damage to equipment. The roof of the Seaman's Center, later determined to have been inadequately built, collapsed during the storm and nearly injured people sheltering within it. All schools on Cayman Brac suffered moderate to major damage while the primary school on Little Cayman experienced minor damage. The electrical grid sustained major damage, with all residents on Cayman Brac and Little Cayman losing service. Roughly 400 power poles fell during the storm. Telecommunications experienced similar damage, with landline services disrupted for two to three weeks. Six of the ten affected Digicel sites went down. Effects on the water supply was negligible, with only a few pipes damaged by uprooted trees. Major crop damage took place on Grand Cayman, primarily to bananas, plantains, and peppers, due to high winds. =Jamaica= Flooding was reported in parts of Jamaica as a result of the outer bands of Paloma. One person drowned in Clarendon Parish while crossing a flooded river. Severe flooding also destroyed crops in 100 farms, causing over $100,000 in damages. In St. Catherine, several inches of rain caused flooding in Bog Walk Gorge which inundated several homes and stranded at least 15 people. Numerous vehicles were washed away in the floods. =Cuba= Hurricane Paloma was the final tropical cyclone to impact Cuba during the destructive 2008 season. Preceded by Fay, Gustav, Hanna, and Ike, Paloma compounded damage sustained by the nation. The 2008 season is regarded as the most destructive in Cuban history, primarily due to the effects of Gustav and Ike. Total damage from hurricanes that year amounted to $9.4 billion. Cuban utility officials say Paloma's effect on the power grid was not as bad as the destruction caused by Gustav and Ike earlier in the season. Paloma did, however knock down power and telephone lines, as well as a major communications tower. The hurricane brought with it a 14-foot (4 meter) storm surge which moved the coastline inland by almost a mile (about 1.5 km) in Santa Cruz del Sur, doing extensive damage. In Santa Cruz del Sur where Paloma came ashore, 435 homes were torn to shreds. The sea swept more than a mile inland. The wind and waves left wooden houses in splinters, topped with seaweed. Two of the two-story concrete walls of a factory crumbled into piles of rubble, smashing 57 wooden fishing boats stored inside for safekeeping. An estimated 328 hectares of crops were destroyed by the storm, most of which were in the process of recovery following Hurricane Ike. A total of 8,000 homes in Santa Cruz were damaged and another 670 in Camaguey and Las Tunas. About 7,000 farmers and 4,700 residences were isolated by floodwaters. Overall damages in Cuba totaled to $300 million. =Florida= Infrared satellite image of the remnant of Paloma over the Florida Panhandle After tracking through the Gulf of Mexico, the remnants of Paloma reached the Florida Panhandle on November 14. Shortly before crossing the coastline, convection suddenly and explosively developed, contributing to a swath of heavy rains. The highest amount was recorded in Bloxham at which contributed to flash flooding. Unofficial radar observations indicated rainfall totals up to . The torrential rains marked the highest rainfall for November 14 in the state of Florida. Flood waters south of Tallahassee reached in places, stranding vehicles. One person was trapped by flood waters but was rescued without injury. Aftermath Owing to the hurricane's destructive effects in the Cayman Islands and Cuba, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Paloma in the Spring of 2009 and replaced it with Paulette, which was first used in 2020. The name Paloma will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. =Cayman Islands= Local groups in the Cayman Islands set up funds following Hurricane Paloma. By March 3, 2009, one group raised $120,000 in relief funds and received another $20,000 in donations. Following the storm, the British Red Cross released ¬£15,000 (US$23,500) in emergency funds. The Government of the Cayman Islands and the Adventist Disaster Response Agency distributed basic relief items such as tarpaulins, hygiene items and buckets to victims of the storm. The overall impacts from Hurricane Paloma were reflected in the territory's GDP by a 0.9 percent decrease, worth $33 million, in the expected growth for 2008. Total revenue fell by $11.6 million while expenditures rose by $28.2 million. Strain on the economy prompted inflation to rise slightly above 5.2 percent for the year as well. Between November 18 and December 13, 675 tons of debris was collected which covered an area of 21 acres by tall. =Cuba= Already severely impacted by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, the European Commission, through its Humanitarian Aid department was already providing ‚Ç¨2 million (US$2.7 million) in relief aid. By November 21, about 6,000 volunteers from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies were in Cuba assisting in cleanup efforts and helping victims in shelters. The organization also allocated US$8.8 million in relief funds for 60,000 people affected by Paloma.

It is one of the largest not- for-profit, voluntary care providers in Alberta and British Columbia. Aim The Good Samaritan Society strives to provide a quality of care that will enable the elderly and the physically and mentally challenged to experience an optimum quality of life. Service area The Good Samaritan Society serves over 7500 individuals throughout Alberta and in British Columbia. The society holds an organization-wide three-year accreditation status with Accreditation Canada through 2011. History The society was created in 1949 and built its first facility, a long-term care hospital in 1955. Capital development since then in the greater Edmonton area includes five continuing care centres, four assisted living facilities, an apartment building for independent seniors, and many purpose-built or service-provided homes. In 2001, the society expanded outside of the greater Edmonton area into smaller communities in Alberta and British Columbia. Since that time, GSS has opened programs in Medicine Hat, Lethbridge, Pincher Creek, Magrath, Stony Plain, Hinton, Evansburg, and Rocky Mountain House, and Kelowna, Penticton, Vernon, Salmon Arm, New Westminster, Gibsons and Nanaimo, British Columbia. Facilities are under construction in Taber, Raymond and Cardston, Alberta. Organisation A volunteer Board of Directors governs GSS as a not-for-profit health and social services organization. Registered in Alberta and British Columbia, The society is owned by members who qualify for membership status.

Service areas include independent living; assisted living; complex/continuing care; programs for persons with development disabilities; Telecare personal emergency response services; rehabilitative services; community care programs and day programs. Strategy In 1990, the Board of Directors recommended that the society adopt strategies to meet the service demands, cultural changes, and economic trends that it had forecast. One of the outcomes was the development of assisted living. The first assisted living facility in Canada, Wedman House, officially opened April 1994. Programs The Good Samaritan Society has developed a cottage program for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. The society runs community programs, such as day programs and shared living that seeks to assist people in their own homes and communities.

History On November 4, 2008, Arkansas voters approved a ballot question legalizing the sale of lottery tickets there. The Arkansas Scholarship Lottery Act establishes a Commission to oversee the operation of the Lottery in Arkansas (see Arkansas Lottery Commission below). On July 1, 2009, Arkansas voted to join the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL); it was the 33rd lottery to join. Ticket buyers must be at least 18, which is the usual minimum age for US lotteries, but lower than in neighboring Louisiana. Video lottery is prohibited. Arkansas started selling scratch off tickets on September 28, 2009. Powerball tickets went on sale on October 31, 2009.http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 Mega Millions tickets went on sale in Arkansas on January 31, 2010. Arkansas conducts its in-house draw games using a random number generator (RNG); it is believed to be the first US lottery to begin with computerized drawings. Balls and drawing machines are not used by the Lottery, although this \\"classic\\" drawing method is used in Arkansas' multi-jurisdictional games (Lucky for Life, Mega Millions, and Powerball.) Arkansas Lottery Commission Subchapter 2 of the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery Act established the creation of the Arkansas Lottery Commission. The subchapter established the Commission or Lottery as a self-supporting and revenue-raising agency of the state. The commission had 9 members by law, of whom three were appointed by the Governor, three by the Speaker of the state House of Representatives, and three by the President Pro Tempore of the state Senate. After the initial appointment of commissioners, the normal term of each commissioner was six years. Commissioners were limited to no more than two terms of six years and General Assembly members or anyone in their immediate family were prohibited from serving as commissioners. In the 2015 legislative session of the General Assembly, the Arkansas Lottery Commission was abolished.

History After the southern states seceded from the United States of America, Albert Pike negotiated treaties between the Five Civilized Tribes and the Confederate government, promising that the Confederacy would take over the obligations that the Union failed to fulfill and take over defense for the Indian Territory. Pike was appointed commander of the Department of the Indian Territory in November 1861. His first assignment was to construct a fort north of Bacone College on the Arkansas River near Muskogee. He named this site Cantonment Davis. However, he and his troops were ordered to leave the site to support the Confederate troops at Pea Ridge. They never returned to Cantonment Davis.Morrison, W. B. \\"Fort McCulloch.\\" In: Chronicles of Oklahoma. Volume 4, Number 3, September 1926. Retrieved January 15, 2014. Pike's Native American troops participated in the Battle of Pea Ridge near Leetown, Arkansas in March 1862. The battle was a defeat for the Confederate Army. Pike then considered that his Indian Territory command post at Fort Davis, Cherokee Nation, was vulnerable to a Union attack. He retreated to the Choctaw Nation in southern Indian Territory. Pike chose a site on a bluff on the west side of the Blue River near Nail's Crossing, where he established Fort McCulloch, named for General Benjamin McCulloch, who fell in battle at Pea Ridge. The site, about southwest of the present-day town of Kenefic, Oklahoma, controlled military roads linking Fort Smith with Fort Washita, Fort Gibson and north Texas. The fort had earthworks, but no permanent buildings. Its importance diminished after Pike resigned his command in July 1862. It was not abandoned until the end of the war. Meanwhile, it served as a haven for pro-Confederate refugees. General Stand Watie used it briefly as a command post in 1865.May, Jon D.

The campaign was inaugurated in February with a dramatic ceremony held at the base of the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World). Approximately 200 BSA Statue of Liberty replicas were installed across the United States. BSA Statue of Liberty replicas Statue of Liberty replica, donated by the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), is located at Haldimand Bay, Mackinac Island, Michigan. As part of the Strengthening the Arm of Liberty campaign to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), hundreds of scale replicas of the Statue of Liberty have been created nationwide. The Statue of Liberty, by French sculptor Fr√©d√©ric Auguste Bartholdi, bears the classical appearance of the Roman stola, sandals, and facial expression which are derived from Libertas, ancient Rome's goddess of freedom from slavery, oppression, and tyranny. Her raised right foot is on the move. This symbol of Liberty and Freedom is not standing still or at attention in the harbor, but moving forward, as her left foot tramples broken shackles at her feet, in symbolism of the United States's wish to be free from oppression and tyranny. =Manufacture= Between 1949 and 1952, approximately two hundred 100-inch (2.5 m) replicas of the statue, made of stamped copper, were purchased by Boy Scout troops and donated in 39 states in the U.S. and several of its possessions and territories. The project was the brainchild of Kansas City businessman, J.P. Whitaker, who was then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council. The copper statues were manufactured by Friedley-Voshardt Co. (Chicago, Illinois) and purchased through the Kansas City Boy Scout office by those wanting one. The statues are approximately 8 feet tall without the base, constructed of sheet copper, weigh 290 pounds, and originally cost () plus freight. The mass-produced statues are not meticulously accurate: a conservator notes that \\"her face isn't as mature as the real Liberty. It's rounder and more like a little girl's.\\" =Today= Many of these statues have been lost or destroyed, but preservationists have been able to account for about 100 of them, and BSA Troop 101 of Cheyenne, Wyoming has collected photographs of more than 100 of them. The Wikipedia list is approaching 150 examples. Examples of the statues can be found at Birmingham, Alabama, Fayetteville, Arkansas, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Greeley, Colorado, at the Mississippi riverfront in Burlington, Iowa, at Overland Park, Kansas and at Chimborazo Park in Richmond, Virginia. Over the years, the copper skins on several of the miniature statues began to take on oxidation, perfectly resembling the statue from which they are modeled, and several more had been renovated, and repaired. The statue in Burlington had been taken from its original position in Dankwardt Park, completely renovated, repaired, and polished, and then placed on a pedestal at the riverfront, where it sits today. Other artifacts of the project thumb A Strengthen the Arm of Liberty brass pin was produced for uniform and civilian wear. The pin is in the shape of the Statue of Liberty superimposed on a fleur de lis. The Robbins Company, which made BSA's Eagle medals for many years, made these pins and the winged \\"R\\" hallmark is prominently displayed on the reverse. A commemorative neckerchief slide was made for Boy Scouts and for the Cub Scouts.

The cold ashes were then raked back over the fire so as to cover it. The ashes would then keep smoldering giving warmth without a live fire going. The fire could easily be reignited the next morning by merely adding logs back on and allowing air to vent through the ashes. A benefit of covering up the fire in the evening was the prevention of destructive conflagrations caused by unattended live fires, a major concern since at the time most structures were made of wood and burned easily. Voltaire, in his Universal History, notes the curfew bell acted as an ancient police on fire prevention in towns of the northern hemisphere.Andrews, p. 232-3 History The curfew bell with the associated curfew law is recorded by history as having been started by Alfred the Great.Andrew, p. 229Wood/Peshall, p. 177 The law associated with the curfew bell is a custom that history records as being adopted by William I of England in the year 1068.Brand, p. 221Andrews, p. 232 The curfew lawWood/Peshall, p. 177 imposed upon the people was a compulsory duty they had to do or be punished like a criminal.Brand, p. 221 Historians, poets, and lawyers speak of the Medieval law associated with the curfew bell as being levelled mostly against the conquered Anglo-Saxons. It was initially used as a repressive measure by William I to prevent rebellious meetings of the conquered English. He prohibited the use of live fires after the curfew bell was rung to prevent associations and conspiracies. The strict practice of this medieval tradition was pretty much observed during the reign of King William I and William II of England.Brand, p. 222 The law was eventually repealed by Henry I of England in 1103.Andrews, p. 233 A century later in England the curfew bell was associated more with a time of night rather than an enforced curfew law. The curfew bell was in later centuries rung but just associated with a tradition. In Medieval times the ringing of the curfew bell was of such importance that land was occasionally paid for the service.Andrews, p. 236Andrews, p. 238 There are even recorded instances where the sound of the curfew bell sometimes saved the lives of lost travellers by safely guiding them back to town. In Macaulay's History of Claybrook, Claybrooke Magna, (1791), he says, \\"The custom of ringing curfew, which is still kept up in Claybrook, has probably obtained without intermission since the days of the Norman Conqueror.\\"Brand, p. 223 St Peter's Church, Sandwich, where a curfew bell is still rung at 8 pm every evening. In the Articles for the Sexton of Faversham in England it was written of the curfew bell, The time of the curfew bell changed in later centuries after the Middle Ages to nine in the evening and sometimes even to ten. The custom of ringing the curfew bell continued in many British towns and cities, especially in the north of England, well into the 19th century, although by then it had ceased to have any legal status. The tradition is still practiced in the town of Sandwich, Kent, where a curfew bell known as the \\"Pig Bell\\" at St Peter's Church is rung at 8 pm every evening for ten minutes. At Ruthin in Denbighshire, the custom lapsed in the 1970s but was revived in 2020 after the bells of St Peter‚Äôs Church were restored. Etymology Couvre-feu utensil shield for putting out fireplace fires The English word curfew is from old French carre-feu or cerre-feu. These initial French words later derived into couvre-feu. The word was again later turned into cover-feu in the Norman language after the conquering of the English.Andrews, p. 232 Each of these meant to cover the live flaming fire. There was even a metal utensil cover known as the \\"couvre-feu\\", normally only found in houses of the well-to-do. It resembled a shield and was used to be put over the live fire when the curfew bell rang. The curfew bell was known as ignitegium or peritegium bell in the medieval low Latin.Andrews, p. 232 Daines Barrington shows that in an old Scottish poem published in 1770 the word curfew is written curphour. At Penrith, Cumbria in the 19th century, the curfew was known as the \\"Taggy Bell\\", thought to be derived from the Old Norse t≈ìkke, \\"to cover\\".  Poetry  The tyranny of William I is described by the poet Francis Thompson, Chaucer writes on the curfew bell as just as a time, not a law: Shakespeare had unusual times for the curfew bell. In Romeo and Juliet, iv 4, he has Lord Capulet saying: In Tempest, v. 1, Prospero says: :In King Lear, iii. 4, Edgar speaks, In the sixteenth century Bishop Joseph Hall's \\"Fourth Satire\\" it reads: In the play The Merry Devil of Edmonton (published 1608), the curfew was at nine o'clock in the evening: John Milton's put in his allegorical Il Penseroso's mouth the words: In Handel's L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato these words are accompanied by a pizzicato bass-line, representing a distant bell sound. The most famous mention of the curfew in English poetry is in Thomas Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard (1750), whose opening lines are: T. S. Eliot Gus the theater cat (\\"Old possum's book of practical cats\\") Eleanor Farjeon and Herbert Farjeon, William I - 1066 in Kings and Queens (1932).

It was produced from 1896 to 1931 in Rochester, New York by James Cunningham, Son and Company.  Early history  Foreseeing the necessity to switch to the production of horseless carriages, Cunningham started automobile production in 1908 with gasoline engine cars that sold at approximately $3,500, a very high price at the time. Initially the company made only the chassis. They assembled each car to individual customer requirements, using components from other manufacturers. Engines came from Buffalo or Continental. Cunningham also sold electric cars based on their experimental vehicle from the 1890s. By 1910, the company was producing all its parts and selling its cars in the range of $4,500 to $5,000.  The big four-cylinder cars  From 1911 Cunningham offered complete automobiles that were illustrated in its first catalogue. They were hand-built and production was slow: one and a half cars per worker per year from a workforce of 450. Much of the wood- and metal-work was crafted by hand. The first of these cars was the model J, a very large automobile with a Cunningham-built 4-cylinder engine of 40 HP. Wheelbase was 124 in. There were four bodies: a 7-passenger touring car at $3,500, a runabout at $3,250, and a limousine and a landaulet at $4,500 each. For 1912, the model J was offered without much changes. Choice of bodies went up to seven and included three additional open body styles: a 5-passenger phaeton, a 4-passenger torpedo and a 4-passenger toy tonneau, each at $3,500. Prices for the other models remained unchanged. In 1913, the new model M superseded the J and had a slightly less powerful engine rated at 36,1 HP. Its chassis had the same wheelbase as previously. There was a little shuffling with the body styles as the phaeton and torpedo were listed for 5 passengers now. Again, there were seven body styles but the toy tonneau had gone and a new 7-passenger \\"Berlin Limousine\\" joined the range. Prices remained the same with the exception of the two limousine types whose prices rose to $4,600. The main change in the model R that appeared in 1914 was a wheelbase of 129 in. Listed body styles were reduced to six. The torpedo and the \\"Berlin Limousine\\" were dropped. There were now three touring cars (for 4, 5 or 7 passengers, respectively). Prices rose considerably. The runabout was catalogued at $3,500, the tourers at $3,750, and the limousine and landaulet at $5,000 The Model S, built from 1915 until 1916, was the last of the big four-cylinder Cunninghams. Technically, these cars were quite similar to the model R. Body styles and prices remained unchanged. For 1916, the 5-passenger touring car was dropped.  The Cunningham V8  From the outset, Cunningham automobiles were admired for their clean lines. A radiator shell of Nickel silver was included, and a feature seen on many of these cars was the use of aluminum steps instead of running boards, adding another European touch to the car. A V8 engine was developed in 1916 and introduced in the series V-1 Cunningham. A side-valve design with a displacement of 442 c.i., it was rated at 45 hp by the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce (NACC). Cunningham bought many components from outside vendors. For example, the series V's clutch and transmission came from Brown Lipe, axles and rear-wheel brakes from Timken-Detroit, pistons from Lynite, and an electrical system from Westinghouse. Roads were bad and Cunninghams were equipped with an air pump for easier repair of punctured tires. As there was no service network for the company, and owners did not wish to let local mechanics repair their expensive cars, Cunningham sent its own experts to their customers. Series V Cunninghams had a wheelbase of 132 inches. Twelve body styles were listed in its first year. Open types‚Äîfive- and seven-passenger touring cars, a new two-passenger roadster, a three-passenger runabout and a four-passenger toy tonneau‚Äîwere priced at $3,750. There were three new closed styles at $4,500 each: a four-passenger coup√©, a five- passenger sedan and a four-passenger roadster coup√©. At $5,000 each, the four more formal styles (five-passenger touring sedan, six-passenger town car, and a limousine and a berline that both seated eight passengers) were the most expensive. Individualizing these bodies added to the base prices. Cunningham invited its customers to commission their own bodywork, and assisted with design and execution. Such cars could easily cost twice as much as a comparable catalogued style. Listed as 1917 models, these cars were available from 1916. They are among the earliest V8 engines built in the USA, after the Cadillac V8 model which was introduced in 1914. Series V-2 started with model year 1918 and changes were few. Body styles were reduced to eight and prices increased, starting now at $4,250 for open-bodied cars. With the exception of a reintroduced Landaulet at $5,750, closed cars cost $5,500 each. Gone were the runabout, the roadster coup√©, the touring sedan and, again, the toy tonneau. The roadster now seated four passengers, as did the smaller touring car. For 1919 the berline, town car and coup√© styles were dropped. A special roadster became available to commemorate race car driver Ralph De Palma‚Äôs record-breaking run at Sheepshead Bay that year. 1922 Cunningham V4 Model 82-A Town Limousine With the series V-3 that went into production in 1920 came many improvements. Most significant was a new engine, which had the same 442 c. i. displacement as before. There were 3 main bearings on each cylinder bench, and the counterweighted aluminium crankcase was cast in two parts. Pistons were cast iron and the oil pump was gear-driven. Transmission, again by Brown Lipe, had 4 speeds plus overdrive. Also available was an additional chassis with a wheelbase of 142 inches. Drum-type headlamps were introduced. There were three catalogued body styles on the 132-inch. wheelbase, at substantially higher cost. Roadster and 4-passenger touring were $6,200, and the sedan cost $7,600. On the longer chassis, a 6-passenger touring car was available at $6,700. Three formal styles, called Inside Drive limousine, Town Limousine and Landaulet, priced at $8,100 each, were among the most expensive cars of the time. For 1921, there were few changes. Now, there were a touring car and three formal styles (one of them a Cabriolet convertible sedan) on the smaller chassis, with prices starting at $6,000. On the larger chassis, there were two touring cars at $6,700 and $6,800, and a town car and a cabriolet at $8,100 each. For 1922, Cunningham no longer listed prices, only stating \\"Prices Upon Application\\". The cars now offered a four-speed manual transmission and coincidentally were called the series V-4. The Volney-Lacey designed continued, with 45 hp according to the outdated NACC measuring method‚Äîfor 1923, the rating was 90 bhp. The 132-inch (model 91A) and 142-inch (model 82A) wheelbases continued, with mostly Cunningham-built bodywork. By 1926, the engine remained unchanged, and the cars were now equipped with four-wheel brakes.  Racing  On November 17, 1919, Ralph De Palma drove a stripped but otherwise stock series V-3 Cunningham special roadster at 98 mph in a six-mile trial at the Sheepshead Bay Race Track.

It is likely a visionary and hallucinatory summary of scenes from Chapters 4 and 5Although some imagery from Chapter 6 is also described in this work, of the Book of Revelation when the throne of God was presented to the prophet Saint John the Divine.Fuseli, Blake and the Romantic Imagination.

Paintings and drawings from the series are typically characterised by intense displays of colour and The Four and Twenty Elders is generally held as one of the most vivid examples of Blake's output from the period.Myrone, 109 Blake's Sketch for The Four and Twenty Elders (pencil on paper, 488 x 389 mm), although loosely drawn, anticipates the symmetrical architecture of the finished piece.\\"Sketch for 'The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne'\\".

God is pictured sitting on his throne at the center of the panel and portrayed as an ancient figure with a long and broad white beard, dressed in red clothing. The Deity holds a book or scroll in his right hand, according to scripture, \\"written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals',Revelation 5.1 while his left hand is raised in a gesture of benediction and blessing.Robertson, 68 His throne is enclosed by a rainbow which radiates from below a pointed Gothic arch formed from the wings of angels. Before the throne is a slain lamb, \\"having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth\\".Revelation 5.6 The lamb's seven horns are represented by seven spikes fanned above his corpse, while the seven cherubic heads beneath him allude to the \\"seven Spirits of God\\". Each cherub is crowned by a tongued flame, a reference to the \\"seven lamps of fire\\" described in Revelation 4.5. In Revelation, Saint John wrote, :And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment: and they had on their heads crowns of gold. A row of twelve white-clad bearded figures float on either side of the Deity, although only four figures from each row are visible to the viewer of the panel. Each figure bends towards God, in adoration, to lay a golden crown at his feet. Above the head of God are the Four Beasts, \\"full of eyes before and behind\\".Revelation 4.6 Above and to the left of God perches the Eagle, opposite of whom is the Lion (Psalm 91) Both are portrayed with the pallor of death and both are situated beneath the distorted heads of monstrous birds and animals. The Ox and Angel are positioned behind the throne and peer outwards, according to the Blake collector W. Graham Robertson, \\"dimly [and] half hidden in the pale crimson and violet rays which emanate from the central figure, and shoot up to meet and be absorbed in the rainbow.\\"Robertson, 69 There are many uses of numerical symbolism in The Four and Twenty Elders, and according to the Blake scholar Martin Myrone, \\"the way, as with [Blake's] Ezekiel's Wheels, that multiples and unities meld into one another, underpinned Blakes own poetic conceptions.\\" The painting was first passed to Butts and upon his death was bequeathed to his son.

It is growing very quickly around the world. It is also played by sighted players, but they are not allowed to participate in the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) tournaments. Showdown is widely spread in Europe, but it's also played in: Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. After the success of Showdown at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympics, representatives from more than thirty countries contacted the International Blind Sports Federation Showdown Subcommittee. They wanted information about equipment, blueprints, and rules so they could play this game in their country. Currently, the IBSA Showdown Sub-committee is encouraging regional and national Showdown Tournaments in an effort to have international championships which, hopefully, will lead to sanctioning by the Paralympics.  Equipment  The sport is comparatively inexpensive to start up, requires minimal maintenance, and can be played in a room the size of a classroom. The only equipment needed is the specially designed table, two paddles, a special ball into which BBs have been inserted to make it audible, opaque goggles, and a glove to protect the batting hand. The table can be disassembled and stored away after play if necessary.  How to play the game  The game is played by 2 players, on a rectangular table with a centre board screen, and goal pockets on either short sides. The objective of the game is to bat the ball across the table, under the centreboard screen, into the opponent's goal, while the opponent tries to prevent this from happening. The players have to wear eye protection, to ensure that they won't be able to see the ball. Play is always initiated with a serve. To serve correctly, players must hit the ball so that it bounces off the side wall of the table exactly once, before passing under the centre screen. If not performed correctly, 1 point will be awarded to the opponent. Each player serves two times in a row. A player scores two points for a goal and one point when their opponent hits the ball into the screen, hits the ball off the table, touches the ball with the bat or the batting hand within the goal area, touches the ball with anything but the bat, or traps or stops the ball for more than 2 seconds, making the ball inaudible for the opponent. One point is also awarded to the opponent if a player touches his or her eye protection without first asking permission. Matches are usually played in 3 sets, best of 2 wins. The first player to reach 11 points, leading by 2 or more points wins the set. The exceptions are semifinals, and finals where best of 3 sets wins. Players will change sides after each set in match play. In the last set of the match the players will switch sides after 6 points are scored by 1 player or after half of stop time has expired. Spectators must be quiet during play, so as not to interfere with the players ability to hear the ball. Cheering is however allowed after the referee has whistled.  History  In the 1960s, Joe Lewis, a totally blind Canadian, wanted to find a sport specifically designed so that individuals with visual impairments or blindness could play without sighted assistance. He ended up inventing the game of Showdown, which now is played by the visually impaired, as well as by the sighted, all over the world. Over the years, Patrick York, a totally blind, Canadian athlete, has collaborated with Lewis on refinements to the rules and equipment. Additional rules have evolved from different parts of the world to make the game what it is today. Showdown was an international success at its debut as a recreational sport during the 1980 Olympiad for the Physically Disabled in Arnhem, the Netherlands . International interest was sparked and Showdown was played recreationally at the: 1984 Olympics for the Disabled in Long Island, USA; 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, South Korea; 1990 World Youth Games in St. Etienne, France; 1990 World Championships in Assen, The Netherlands; 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona, Spain; and at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta, the United States. Today, Showdown is being played extensively in countries throughout Europe, and in a few countries in Africa, Asia and South America as well. In North America, where it was invented, it has been slow to cross the borders into mainstream usage.  Showdown countries  = Europe = In Europe Showdown is played in at least 20 countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland http://www.swiss- showdown.ch and Turkey. = Africa = We know that they are playing showdown in the following countries in Africa: Ghana, Uganda, South Africa, Kenya and Morocco. It has however proved to be really hard to get information about How many players there are, and how much they are playing. = Asia = Very little is known about the development of the sport in Asia. In The Philippines they started playing quite recently. In South Korea is so widely played that some players have participated in some international tournaments and Jun Hyoung Kim, Dong Hyun Kim and Min Sun An was the first players in a World Championship, in 2019 in Olbia. In Mongolia they are on their way to do it. In Barein, Kuwait they bought a table and started a few years ago. Players from Sweden have also brought the sport to the Iranian part of Kurdistan. In China and Japan they have been playing for a few years. Unfortunately that's all the information currently available about Asia. = North America = James Mastro is teaching people how to play showdown, or Power-Showdown, as he calls it, in the United States. He is also building tables for it, and it is currently played in 6 different states.

Most are found in the southern port city of Basra, with many speaking Arabic and adhering to Islam. It is estimated that there are roughly 1,500,000 Afro-Iraqis. Iraqis of significant Sub-Saharan African ancestry account for nearly 1 in 6 Iraqis based on mitochondrial DNA, with an average frequency of 17.48% African ancestry.. The origins of the sub-Saharan African genetic material most likely dates back to the time of the Arab slave trade of women from Sub-Saharan Africa. History Most Afro-Iraqis are the descendants of sailors, traders and mostly slave origin that were brought to Iraq from the Zanj region. The term Zanj also used to describe them is attributed to Zanzibar, an island off of the coast of Tanzania. Slave trade begun by early Arab traders started in the 9th century and lasted over a millennium. Most of these slaves were imported to work in large dates and sugarcane plantations. To protest their treatment, Zanj slaves from Basra staged a successful revolt (the Zanj Rebellion) against Baghdad, which lasted for 15 years (869‚Äì883). During this period they created a city called Moktara. In 883, the Army from Baghdad put down the revolt. Afterwards, locals did not engage in large-scale plantation-type slavery. Slavery lasted up until the 19th century. However, there were reports of dark-skinned slaves in Iraq in 2008. Social condition Unlike in the Americas of the 19th century, slaves in the Middle East were allowed to own land and their children were generally not born into slavery. Also conversion to Islam precluded further servitude and gave freedom. Skin color played a distinctive role even amongst slaves. Many activists amongst Afro-Iraqis complain that they are unable to find opportunities to improve their social condition. However, the same complaint is often also made by Iraqis of Arab Semitic descent as well. Heritage Most Afro-Iraqis still are able to maintain rituals related to healing that are of Zanj origin. The languages used in these rituals are Swahili and Arabic. Instruments such as Drums and tambourines are used in these ceremonies. In a song called Dawa Dawa, the words are a mix of Arabic and Swahili. The song, which is about curing people, is used in the shtanga ceremony, for physical health. Another ceremony called nouba, takes its name from Arabic for paroxysm or shift, as Sophi performers take turns at chanting and dancing to ritualistic hymns. There are also unique ceremonies to remember the dead and for occasions such as weddings.

He was born in Budapest. He died in Pasadena, CA.  Biography  Martin was part of the Hungarian team which won the gold medals in the 1952 and the 1956 tournaments. He played two matches, including the \\"Blood in the Water\\" semi- final match against the Soviet Union, and scored five goals. His name is often left out of the 1956 Olympics because he defected to the United States immediately after the games, along with numerous fellow Olympians, and the communist party of Hungary at the time omitted him. In all, the U.S. State Department granted asylum to 34 of the Hungarian athletes.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1200409/3/index.htm In June 2012, the magazine Sports Illustrated published a detailed account of the Hungarian defections that resulted from the Soviet Union's involvement in Hungary. The magazine itself played a key role in facilitating a secret plan to bring defecting Olympians to the United States. When the Hungarian delegation touched down in Darwin, Australia, Martin, one of the only athletes who read English, found a newspaper in the transit lounge and shared its reports. He became one of the primary spokespeople for the group.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1200409/index.htm As the best English speaker among the Hungarian Olympians who defected, Martin found himself quoted so often that he feared he would be punished as a ringleader if he were to return to Hungary. So, with an art history master's degree from the University of Budapest, he enrolled at the University of Southern California but played only one semester of water polo because he found the sport there \\"too Mickey Mouse.\\" He was the first person to receive a water polo scholarship to USC.http://www.pasadenanow.com/main/former-pcc- water-polo-coach-martin-profiled-in-cnn-sports-illustrated-feature Instead he buckled down, earned his B.A. in French in three terms and, after earning a Ph.D. in Romance languages at Princeton on a Woodrow Wilson scholarship, became a professor. \\"The U.S. of that period was a land of endless opportunities,\\" he says, \\"but my teaching career has been like an avalanche, straight down -- from Princeton to USC to Pasadena City College.\\" Although retired from full-time teaching and over 80, he was still an adjunct professor of French at PCC and swam a mile each day. \\"PCC has a gorgeous pool,\\" he says, \\"and I have the key.\\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/magazine/06/13/hungary.sb/index.html In 2006, Colin K.

Reagan most memorably deployed the phrase \\"there you go again\\". \\"There you go again\\" was a phrase spoken during the second presidential debate of 1980 by Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan to his Democratic opponent, incumbent President Jimmy Carter. Reagan would use the line in a few debates over the years, always in a way intended to disarm his opponent. \\"There you go again\\" emerged as a defining phrase of the 1980 presidential election. The phrase has endured in the political lexicon in news headlines, as a way to quickly imply that an opponent is engaged in hyperbole or even hysterical comments. Context The second debate between Reagan and Carter of the 1980 presidential election year was held (October 28) a week before Election Day by the League of Women Voters. At one point, Carter went on the offensive against Reagan's record regarding Medicare. :President Carter: These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country. It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people... Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare. Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it. These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people. Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal. :(Moderator) Howard K. Smith: Governor? :Governor Reagan: There you go again. When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress. I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed. I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them. I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another. An Associated Press article from 2008 stated: > Reagan was a master at capturing a debate moment that everyone will > remember. His 'there you go again' line defused his opponent's attack. Later use Reagan used the phrase during the first Presidential Debate in 1984 against Walter Mondale. Reagan sometimes used the phrase during his presidential press conferences. In the 2008 vice presidential debate, Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin used the line on her Democratic opponent Joe Biden. During the 2012 presidential election, former President Bill Clinton paraphrased the line after criticizing the policies of the Republican platform by saying, \\"There they go again.\\" In the 2016 vice presidential debate, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence used the line \\"There they go again\\" in responding to Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine's statement that Pence was a \\"chief cheerleader for the privatization of social security.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us- news/live/2016/oct/04/tim-kaine-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate-elections- live References External links *Reagan interview regarding the debate *Clip (YouTube) *Reagan uses the line in a 1984 presidential debate (YouTube) Category:Political terminology of the United States Category:American political catchphrases Category:Political quotes Category:Ronald Reagan Category:United States presidential debates Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1980 ","title":"There you go again"},{"id":"20086925","text":"Gregory \\"Greg\\" Heffley is a fictional character and the protagonist of the realistic fiction novel series Diary of a Wimpy Kid created by American cartoonist Jeff Kinney. He serves as the antihero and unreliable narrator of the series. Personality Greg Heffley is mischievous, lazy, paranoid, arrogant, and dishonest. He is known to become jealous easily. He also tends to be a poor friend, something even he agrees with. He doesn't like taking the blame for negative events, and attempts to twist any situation he can in his favor, so that he may go up his \\"popularity ladder.\\" Despite all of these negative traits, he has displayed a kinder side. Throughout the series, Greg's schemes to acquire money and popularity always backfire. He also enjoys playing video games, particularly the fictional \\"Twisted Wizard\\". His best friend is Rowley Jefferson (they often get into arguments). Rowley takes part in Greg's schemes and is sometimes a victim of Greg's manipulation and deception. The two have a very complicated relationship, as Greg sometimes takes advantage of Rowley's good nature, and his own schemes fail due to Rowley's foolishness, such as Rowley's \\"confession\\" to the vandalized wall. Rowley's parents, mostly his father, view Greg as a bad influence on their son. This is because Greg has a tendency for getting himself and Rowley into trouble. In 'Wrecking Ball', it is revealed that Greg truly did have a soft spot for Rowley, as Greg cries when it is time to say goodbye to him. At school, Greg receives bad grades, gets bullied, deals with the hardships of middle school, and is always trying to earn popularity points in order to gain attention and respect (though his plans to do so often result in either his own popularity dropping, or unintentionally boosting Rowley's popularity). At home, Greg has a mixed relationship with his family, especially with his younger brother Manny, who is overly pampered and protected by his parents (particularly his mother Susan). His mother tries to devise ways for Greg and his older brother Rodrick to get along but which never work out. Greg's father, Frank, is annoyed by Greg's antics and laziness and tries to make him more active. Greg has a love/hate relationship with his older brother, Rodrick. Greg is often tormented and bullied by Rodrick and is also the victim of his pranks yet they do care for each other deep down. In addition, he has inherited many of Rodrick's traits (such as laziness, large ego, disdain for sports, being a trickster, etc.). In fact, many of Greg's teachers dislike him because they originally had Rodrick as a student even though Greg's classroom behavior does not mirror Rodrick's. A notable trait of Greg that becomes more apparent as the novels go on is his lack of logical and critical thinking. A lot of his actions are shown to have no thought or consideration prior to being acted out, and usually end in disastrous repercussions. This is shown in when he delays his family by drying his sock after stepping in a slush puddle while heading to an airport, and later burning the sock while attempting to dry it. Greg also has been shown to display constant forgetfulness as well as no linear thinking. A good example of this is when he constantly has to remind himself to put his socks before his shoes after a string of incidents involving him doing the opposite act. Greg is a fan of video games and comic books and he sees them as talents, which annoys his father Frank. His greatest gift is for cartooning and dry humor, evidenced by the many comic strips he has drawn. Another character trait of Greg is his paranoia, which sometimes seems to get the better of him. A notable example of this is in Cabin Fever, in which he is worried that his old doll, Alfrendo, will come back to haunt him, and the Santa's Scout doll that he fears is actually following him around before finally realizing it is Rodrick who is doing it. Another notable example is in 'Wrecking Ball', when Gregs fears an imaginary monster called 'The Grout' and locks himself in his room until his father screws the door out. Greg rarely learns from his ill-fated mistakes and continues to scheme and plot for his various goals. Because of this and his impulsive nature, he usually puts himself and others in trouble, and will often try to find another person to take the blame. Neighboring Greg is his awkward, unpopular and eccentric schoolmate named Fregley, whose vast variety of oddities disgust and befuddle those around him, including Greg, who tries to distance himself from Fregley as much as possible. Though Greg detests the fact that he is next- door-neighbors with Fregley, the only time he has ever shown interest in acquiring friendship with Fregley is in the eighth book Hard Luck, where he becomes friends with Fregley (though this was really to Greg's advantage to become popular). Greg is also noted for having many attractions to girls throughout the series, most notably a girl named Holly Hills, his classmate. His schemes usually fail in the hope of attracting girls though. One very notable example is The Third Wheel, where Greg attempts to use Rowley as a wingman to get himself a date for the upcoming Valentine's Day dance. He succeeds in obtaining the chance to take a girl named Abigail to the dance, but Rowley, who tags along as a third wheel, hence the name, proves to be a better date than Greg at the dance. This ultimately leads to Rowley and Abigail becoming a couple, setting the stage for Hard Luck. Greg has also been known to be very clumsy, as he forgets his homework, and when he was eight, wet the bed. Despite his many flaws and the situations they have landed him in, Greg can be caring, intelligent, courageous, compassionate and thoughtful, and has done a number of good deeds to prove this, such as deceiving his classmates that he threw the cheese away (to save Rowley's reputation), helping Rodrick complete his science project, etc. Greg also showed unusual maturity when he chose to conceal his late Meemaw's diamond ring that he found in an Easter egg, not wanting to see his family fight over it because it had not been willed to anyone. In the films Zachary Gordon as Greg Heffley. In the first three adaptions of the series, Greg was portrayed by actor Zachary Gordon. The first adaption Diary of a Wimpy Kid was directed by Thor Freudenthal. The film was released on March 19, 2010. It was released on DVD, iTunes, and Blu-ray on August 3, 2010. The movie stars Zachary Gordon as Greg, Robert Capron as Rowley, Steve Zahn as Greg's father, Rachael Harris as Greg's mother, Devon Bostick as Rodrick, Chlo√´ Grace Moretz as a new character named Angie, and Connor and Owen Fielding as Manny. The second film Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules was released by 20th Century Fox on March 25, 2011 worldwide and March 17 in Singapore with the old cast reprising as their roles. The film was directed by David Bowers and it follows Greg and Rodrick's mother Susan's misguided attempts to force the two brothers to bond with each other through a system called \\"Mom Bucks\\". It received mixed reviews from critics though it has received several awards and has been nominated for several nominations, mostly at the 33rd Young Artist Awards. The third film in the franchise is titled Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days and was released on August 3, 2012, with the old cast returning in their roles. Bowers returns as director, and the film follows Greg's rough summer break. It is the final film to feature the original cast. The cast was completely changed for the fourth film Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, which was released on May 19, 2017 with Jason Drucker as Greg, Charlie Wright as Rodrick, Owen Asztalos as Rowley, Wyatt and Dylan Walters as Manny, Tom Everett Scott as Frank and Alicia Silverstone as Susan. In other works Greg Heffley appears on Poptropica's 18th island, \\"Wimpy Wonderland,\\" which revolves around the Wimpy Kid series. Greg has also appeared as a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade since 2010. Poptropica's 28th island, \\"Wimpy Boardwalk,\\" also revolves around the Wimpy Kid series. Wimpy Boardwalk was the first time that Greg was shown in color. Reception Although the character was acclaimed by critics in the books, the reception was not the same for the film; Rotten Tomatoes has said that Greg is an \\"unlikable protagonist\\". Pomeranz disliked the character of Greg Heffley, saying \\"I really thought he was unpleasant. I did not want to spend time with him. I couldn't wait for the end of this film.\\" However, these were reviews for the first film and in her review of the Dog Days film, Abby West of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Greg is a likeable kid.

The more likely origin of the tunnel is that local boys would be labelled \\"jessies\\" (Scottish word for effeminate) for using it, rather than crossing the tracks. The third, and most controversial theory, is that the tunnel was named after Jessie, a local inhabitant, who used the tunnel to peddle her wares. This theory however is probably explained by local tavern rumour.Jessie's Tunnel The station features in the novel The Thirty-Nine Steps, written by John Buchan. Richard Hannay walks to the station from Moffat, before catching a night-train south to England. There is a short story \\"Beattock for Moffatt\\" by Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham about a Scotsman with consumption hoping to reach Beattock before he dies.  Current operations  Trains pass at speed on the electrified West Coast Main Line. The remnants of the station are still visible on the site. Following the trackwork associated with the electrification work, Beattock retained the down loop, and an up loop was created.Nock (1974), page 140  References  = Notes = = Sources =  * * External links * RAILSCOT on Caledonian Railway * RAILSCOT on Moffat Railway * Beattock railway station on navigable OS map * Jessie's Tunnel Category:Disused railway stations in Dumfries and Galloway Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1847 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1972 Category:Former Caledonian Railway stations Category:1847 establishments in Scotland Category:William Tite railway stations Category:1972 disestablishments in Scotland ","title":"Beattock railway station"},{"id":"20086937","text":"In mathematics, in the area of quantum information geometry, the Bures metric (named after Donald Bures) or Helstrom metric (named after Carl W. Helstrom) defines an infinitesimal distance between density matrix operators defining quantum states. It is a quantum generalization of the Fisher information metric, and is identical to the Fubini‚ÄìStudy metric when restricted to the pure states alone. Definition The Bures metric G may be defined as : [d(\\\\rho, \\\\rho+d\\\\rho)]^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mbox{tr}( d \\\\rho G ), where G is Hermitian 1-form operator implicitly given by : \\\\rho G + G \\\\rho = d \\\\rho, which is a special case of a continuous Lyapunov equation. Some of the applications of the Bures metric include that given a target error, it allows the calculation of the minimum number of measurements to distinguish two different states and the use of the volume element as a candidate for the Jeffreys prior probability density for mixed quantum states. Bures distance The Bures distance is the finite version of the infinitesimal square distance described above and is given by : D_B(\\\\rho_1,\\\\rho_2)^2 = 2(1-\\\\sqrt{F(\\\\rho_1,\\\\rho_2)}), where the fidelity function is defined as Unfortunately, some authors use a different definition, F(\\\\rho_1,\\\\rho_2) = \\\\mbox{tr}( \\\\sqrt{ \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_1}\\\\rho_2\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_1}}) : F(\\\\rho_1,\\\\rho_2) = \\\\left[ \\\\mbox{tr}( \\\\sqrt{ \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_1}\\\\rho_2\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_1}})\\\\right]^2. Another associated function is the Bures arc also known as Bures angle, Bures length or quantum angle, defined as : D_A(\\\\rho_1,\\\\rho_2) = \\\\arccos \\\\sqrt{F(\\\\rho_1,\\\\rho_2)}, which is a measure of the statistical distance between quantum states. Quantum Fisher information The Bures metric can be seen as the quantum equivalent of the Fisher information metric and can be rewritten in terms of the variation of coordinate parameters as : [d(\\\\rho, \\\\rho+d\\\\rho)]^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mbox{tr}\\\\left( \\\\frac{d \\\\rho}{d \\\\theta^{\\\\mu}} L_{ u} \\\\right) d \\\\theta^{\\\\mu} d\\\\theta^{ u}, which holds as long as \\\\rho and \\\\rho+d\\\\rho have the same rank. In cases where they do not have the same rank, there is an additional term on the right hand side. L_\\\\mu is the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative operator (SLD) defined from : \\\\frac{\\\\rho L_{\\\\mu} + L_{\\\\mu} \\\\rho}{2} = \\\\frac{d \\\\rho^{\\\\,}}{d \\\\theta^{\\\\mu}}. In this way, one has : [d(\\\\rho, \\\\rho+d\\\\rho)]^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mbox{tr}\\\\left[ \\\\rho \\\\frac{L_{\\\\mu} L_{ u} + L_{ u} L_{\\\\mu}}{2} \\\\right] d \\\\theta^{\\\\mu} d\\\\theta^{ u}, where the quantum Fisher metric (tensor components) is identified as : J_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\mbox{tr}\\\\left[ \\\\rho \\\\frac{L_{\\\\mu} L_{ u} + L_{ u} L_{\\\\mu}}{2}\\\\right]. The definition of the SLD implies that the quantum Fisher metric is 4 times the Bures metric. In other words, given that g_{\\\\mu u} are components of the Bures metric tensor, one has : J_{\\\\mu u}^= 4 g_{\\\\mu u}. As it happens with the classical Fisher information metric, the quantum Fisher metric can be used to find the Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound of the covariance. Explicit formulas The actual computation of the Bures metric is not evident from the definition, so, some formulas were developed for that purpose. For 2x2 and 3x3 systems, respectively, the quadratic form of the Bures metric is calculated as : [d(\\\\rho, \\\\rho+d\\\\rho)]^2 = \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\mbox{tr}\\\\left[ d \\\\rho d \\\\rho + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\det(\\\\rho)}(\\\\mathbf{1}-\\\\rho)d\\\\rho (\\\\mathbf{1}-\\\\rho)d\\\\rho \\\\right], : [d(\\\\rho, \\\\rho+d\\\\rho)]^2 = \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\mbox{tr}\\\\left[ d \\\\rho d \\\\rho + \\\\frac{3}{1-\\\\mbox{tr} \\\\rho^3} (\\\\mathbf{1}-\\\\rho)d\\\\rho (\\\\mathbf{1}-\\\\rho)d\\\\rho \\\\+ \\\\frac{3 \\\\det{\\\\rho} }{1-\\\\mbox{tr} \\\\rho^3} (\\\\mathbf{1}-\\\\rho^{-1})d\\\\rho (\\\\mathbf{1}-\\\\rho^{-1})d\\\\rho \\\\right]. For general systems, the Bures metric can be written in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the density matrix \\\\rho=\\\\sum_{j=1}^n\\\\lambda_jj\\\\rangle\\\\langle j as : [d(\\\\rho, \\\\rho+d\\\\rho)]^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\langle j d\\\\rho  k\\\\rangle ^2}{\\\\lambda_j+\\\\lambda_k}, as an integral, : [d(\\\\rho, \\\\rho+d\\\\rho)]^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\text{tr}[e^{-\\\\rho t}d\\\\rho e^{-\\\\rho t}d\\\\rho]\\\\ dt, or in terms of Kronecker product and vectorization, : [d(\\\\rho, \\\\rho+d\\\\rho)]^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\text{vec}[d\\\\rho]^\\\\dagger\\\\big(\\\\overline{\\\\rho}\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{1}+\\\\mathbf{1}\\\\otimes\\\\rho\\\\big)^{-1}\\\\text{vec}[d\\\\rho], where the overbar denotes complex conjugate, and ^\\\\dagger denotes conjugate transpose. Two-level system The state of a two-level system can be parametrized with three variables as : \\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{2}( I + \\\\boldsymbol{r\\\\cdot\\\\sigma} ), where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} is the vector of Pauli matrices and \\\\boldsymbol{r} is the (three-dimensional) Bloch vector satisfying r^2\\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\\\boldsymbol{r\\\\cdot r} \\\\le 1 . The components of the Bures metric in this parametrization can be calculated as : \\\\mathsf{g} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathsf{I}}{4}+\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r\\\\otimes r}}{4(1-r^2)} . The Bures measure can be calculated by taking the square root of the determinant to find : dV_B = \\\\frac{d^3\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{8\\\\sqrt{ 1 - r^2}}, which can be used to calculate the Bures volume as : V_B = \\\\iiint_{r^2\\\\leq 1}\\\\frac{d^3\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{8\\\\sqrt{1-r^2}} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{8} . Three-level system The state of a three-level system can be parametrized with eight variables as : \\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{3}( I + \\\\sqrt{3} \\\\sum_{ u=1}^8\\\\xi_ u\\\\lambda_ u), where \\\\lambda_ u are the eight Gell-Mann matrices and \\\\boldsymbol \\\\xi \\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^8 the 8-dimensional Bloch vector satisfying certain constraints.

Among them are the rebellious Kang I-na, her best friend Yoon Myong-heo, and the class clown Kang Hyun, who harbors an affection for I-na. After several strange incidents, the class is interrupted by a TV showing of the top-ranking student, Min Hye-yeong, being trapped in a glass being slowly filled with water. A voice over the PA system announces that questions will be posed to the class; failure to answer them in time will lead to their death. It also warns them and their two teachers, Hwang Chang-wook and Choi So-yeong, against leaving the school. The class fails to solve the first question to save Hye-yeong. Despite the warning, the class tries to leave, only to find that a teacher and hall monitor, Mr. Lee, was beaten to death, leaving only Mr. Kim to guard them. The students split up and try to answer the questions while also attempting to find a way out. Several students die, then Beom, who earlier tries to strangle I-na and was put in a mental facility, escapes and attempts to kill I-na, but Hyun shields her from the attack and dies. Chang- wook then kills Beom. I-na discovers to her horror that Myong-heo has also been kidnapped by a mysterious woman. They fail to save her and Chang-wook strangles the woman to death. A memorial is held for the students killed, then I-na is kidnapped unnoticed. One final question is posed: have the person who killed his daughter step forward and confess. The person in question, a now- demented Chang-wook, reveals himself and is killed by the mastermind, who turns out to be Mr. Kim. I-na is then freed by So-yeong. Flashbacks reveal that Kim's daughter, Kim Ji-won, worked hard to enter the elite class. However, the parents of the killed students bribed Chang-wook for the entrance test answers, giving them an unfair advantage. After being disqualified and finding out about the fact, Ji-won confronted Chang-wook and he kills her to cover up his misconduct. The sole witness to the incident, Beom, slowly became mad as he felt that Ji-won had been haunting him ever since. Mr. Kim and his wife (the woman who hang Myong-heo) decided to kill Chang-wook and all the students whose parents they deem responsible for their daughter's death. The film closes with I-na seeing that she tops the class ranking, and it is implied that Beom's attacks was due to her being possessed by Ji-won since the beginning.

It was demolished in 1968; the Huntington Metro Station and several condominium complexes were built on the property. History The first colonial landowner of the area that Mount Eagle would be built upon was a tavern owner, John Mathews, who received a land patent for southwest of Hunting Creek in 1669. He eventually sold part of it to the merchant and land speculator, John Colville, of Newcastle upon Tyne, who put together a parcel of over which he called Cleesh. When he died in 1755, he left 1000 acres of Cleesh to his brother, Thomas, for life and thereafter to his cousin's husband, Charles Bennet, 4th Earl of Tankerville. Thomas died in 1764 and named George Washington as one of his executors. Settlement of the estate took over 30 years and lasted through the American Revolution and both of Washington's terms as President of the United States. In the meantime, Bennet had died and the plantation had passed to his son, The Hon. John Astley Bennet.Netherton, pp. 14, 16‚Äì17, 33 The Montebello Condominiums, erected on the former site of Mount Eagle after its 1968 demolition. In 1789 Fairfax, by now a priest in the Episcopal Church, purchased from Bennet and built Mount Eagle, where he lived from 1790 until his death in 1802.Netherton, pp. 33, 38 Fairfax, a great friend of Washington, hosted Washington‚Äôs last meal away from Mount Vernon, on December 7, 1799. After the death of his wife, Jane Donaldson Fairfax, on 1 July 1805, the balance of their property was distributed amongst their heirs. His eldest son, Thomas, was executor of the estate, and began leasing out Mount Eagle with the first advertisement appearing in the Alexandria Gazette in 1806, placed by his cousin John Herbert. Herbert had either bought the property or was acting as Thomas's agent. His half-sister, Anne, and her husband filed suit in 1807 for an accounting of the estate that dragged through the courts until 1829 when it was decided against them. Herbert placed another advertisement in 1811 and his brother, William Herbert, sold the estate to Walter Jenifer six years later. Jenifer had financial problems the following year and attempted to sell Mount Eagle, but could not do so as the deed had not been recorded and the property reverted to William Herbert. He sold it to George Mason VI in 1825, but he only lived there for a few years before moving to Gunston Hall, and was only able to intermittently lease it, possibly because of its small size.Netherton, pp. 41‚Äì42, 88‚Äì89 After Mason's death in 1834, his widow attempted to sell it for many years, but found no buyers until Court Johnson bought the property in 1845.Netherton, pp. 46, 89 During the American Civil War, the Union Army began construction of earthworks on the ridge southwest of Hunting Creek after the defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. The largest and westernmost of these was Fort Lyon, but only a small portion was on the Johnsons' property, unlike the smaller Fort Farnsworth. Fort Lyon was completed in early 1862 while Fort Farnsworth was completed later in the year to cover the southeast approaches to the ridge. The family did not remain in Mount Eagle during the entire war as there are records of it being used to quarter officers at various times.Netherton, pp. 51‚Äì52 On 9 June 1863, a magazine containing of gunpowder and several thousand artillery shells exploded in Fort Lyon, killing 25 soldiers, and shattering windows in nearby buildings. The site of the explosion was inspected by a virtual parade of senior officers and officials the following day.

Many of its vehicles are now part of the American Heritage Museum run by the Collings Foundation in Stow, Massachusetts. History The first acquisition was an unrestored M3A1 Scout Car. The first two tanks arrived on site in 1983, and by 1988 the collection comprised five armored vehicles. Subsequent military vehicles and associated equipment were acquired from dealers, collectors, or in trade with various museums or government agencies in the United States and abroad. By the middle of the 1990s the collection included examples from almost all historically significant land battles of the last half-century. The oldest armored military vehicle in the collection is a World War I era M1917 light tank. The Foundation was established in early 1998. Littlefield's major objective for the Foundation was to preserve the collection for the future. Over 200 armored fighting vehicles are present in the collection, displayed in a exhibition space at Littlefield's Pony Tracks Ranch in the Vista Verde neighborhood. The ranch was once owned by former San Francisco Mayor and California Governor \\"Sunny Jim\\" Rolph. The foundation offered tours of its collection with a mandatory donation until the inventory was transported to the new museum in Stow. In 2012 the foundation started a new program in conjunction with the Boy Scouts of America to start the youth Venturing Crew 551.

In 2015, the Stow Planning Board questioned the educational merit of the proposed museum. The educational purpose was needed in order to allow the planned museum to be built on land that was zoned for residential use.

He is largely credited with elevating Berkeley's mathematics department to a top- tier research department, having recruited many notable mathematicians in the 1930s and 1940s. Biography Evans earned his PhD at Harvard in 1910 under Maxime B√¥cher with a dissertation on Volterra's Integral Equation, after which he did a post-doc for two years at the University of Rome on a Sheldon Fellowship from Harvard.Morrey, C. B. (1983) Griffith Conrad Evans, 1887-1973: A Biographical Memoir, National Academy of Sciences. The experience of working under Vito Volterra shaped his intellectual life and solidified his interest in the application of mathematics to a broad range of fields. Evans became close to Volterra during his time at Rome, being invited on many occasions to lunch with the Volterra family; he would remain in contact with Virginia Volterra, Vito Volterra's nephew, until the 1960s. Evans was appointed assistant professor at Rice University in 1912, with a recommendation letter from Volterra, and promoted to professor in 1916. He married Isabel Mary John in 1917 and they would eventually have 3 children. During his time at Rice, he managed to attract significant mathematicians as visiting professors, such as Szolem Mandelbrojt, Tibor Rado, and Karl Menger. His early research dealt with functional analysis, potential theory, integral equations, and mathematical economics. In 1934, he moved to University of California, Berkeley to chair the mathematics department.AMS Presidents: Griffith Evans Here, Evans was tasked with improving the department, including the initiation of a graduate program. Much of his success was due to his ability to recruit many notable research mathematicians, including Hans Lewy, Jerzy Neyman, and Alfred Tarski. His own research work was in potential theory and mathematics applied to economics. He chaired Berkeley's department until 1949 and retired in 1955, eventually becoming the namesake of Evans Hall at Berkeley.  Mathematical Economics  Evans first work in mathematical economics, entitled A Simple Theory of Competition a restatement of Augustine Cournot's monopoly/duopoly model. Evans expanded Cournot's work in significantly by exploring the analytical implications of a variety of different assumptions as to the behavior and objectives of either the monopolist or the duopolists. His following work, The Dynamics of Monopoly, published in 1924, was one of the first to apply the calculus of variations to economic theory. He frames the same monopolist problem now in an intertemporal framework, that is, instead of seeking immediate profit-maximization, the monopolist aims to make his profits as maximum through an interval of time. His work was followed by his Ph.D. advisee Charles Roos who generalized his monopoly model to a case with multiple competing firms. Roos also managed to express this model within a general equilibrium framework. Roos would also be one of the three founders of the Econometric Society alongside Norwegian economist Ragnar Frisch and American economist Irving Fisher. Evans participated in the foundation of the Society and became one of its first fellows. The first economist to take notice of Evans' work was Harold Hotelling. He met personally with Evans at a meeting of the American Mathematical Society and was immediately impressed by the scope of his work which he deemed to be a \\"dawning economic theory\\" that would bear \\"to the older theories the relations which the Hamiltonian dynamics and the thermodynamics of entropy bear to their predecessors\\". At this time, economics was not seen as a mathematical science, and many economists were even doubtful if mathematics could be useful for social sciences in general. As a result, Evans and Roos found only a small audience properly equipped to understand their works. Even so, the more mathematically inclined economists and mathematicians E. B. Wilson, Irving Fisher, Henry Schultz, and Paul Samuelson all recognized the importance of their theory. Evans main contribution to mathematical economics came in the form of his 1930 textbook Mathematical Introduction to Economics, published by Mc Graw Hill. The book's reception, however, failed to meet Evans' expectations. British economist Arthur L. Bowley, in particular, was very critical stating that the book would be of no use either to the mathematician nor to the economist. R. G. D. Allen, a colleague of Bowley, also criticized the book for not presenting a general economic theory and focusing too much on the resolution of particular problems. Some positive reviews came from Roos and Hotelling, the latter going as far as saying that the book helped \\"lay a groundwork upon which future contributions to political economy of first-rate importance may be expected to be based\\". Despite the mixed reception of his textbook, Evans continued interested in mathematical economics throughout his lifetime. In 1934 he contributed Maximum Production Studied in a Simplified Economic System to the recently established journal Econometrica, published on behalf of the Econometric Society. This work would later be extended by some of his students at Berkeley. He also maintained contact with the field attending seminars and presenting papers at meetings organized by the Econometric Society and the Cowles Commission for Economic Research. During his time at Berkeley Evans arranged a weekly seminar on mathematical economics at his home. He also supervised many Ph.D. theses in the field that followed similar lines of his work. One of his most notable students was economist Ronald Shephard, famous for his derivation of Shephard's lemma. Shephard's 1953 Cost and Production Functions expands Evans' theoretical work on costs functions. He also restates Evans' classical dynamic monopoly problem, better incorporating expectations and price changes. Other notable students include Francis W. Dresch, Kenneth May, and Edward A. Davis. Some authors, such as Roy Weintraub, argue that Evans' impact in mathematical economics was severely limited by his refusal to adopt utility in his economic models. The subjective theory of value stated the individuals aimed to make their pleasure or utility a maximum. Evans argued that the mathematical conditions to assure the existence of an index function such as utility were stiff and artificial. Moreover, he stated that [t]here is no such measurable quantity as 'value' or 'utility' (with all due respect to Jevons, Walras and others) and there is no evaluation of 'the greatest happiness for the greatest number'; or, more flatly,‚Äì there is no such thing. His 1930 book featured two chapters where he criticized utility from the standpoint of the integrability conditions necessary to guarantee that a demand function be the result of the maximization of some utility function. Despite being criticized by many other authors, utility remained a central concept for economics. Additionally, from the 1940s through the 1960s, Keynesianism dominated the macrodynamics discussion. Samuelson's Foundations of Economic Analysis formalized dynamics as the study of the limiting properties of systems of differential equations. In this sense, the analysis was now confined to the stability and convergence of these systems around a steady state. How the system responded to shocks was deemed more relevant than understanding any particular point of equilibrium. General interest in the calculus of variations an intertemporal optimization rekindled with the rise the neoclassical growth literature (e.g. Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model) that ostensibly employed optimal control and Hamiltonians. Standard textbooks in economics now commonly present some stylized version of Evans' monopoly problem.

At the time of its introduction (2008), it was noted for its combination of a 10.2\\" screen and large 6-cell battery as standard, giving a battery life of up to 7.5 hours, a large hard disk drive and a release price of 499 USD (299 GBP). Technical overview =Processor and memory= The Samsung NC10 uses a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N270 processor running at FSB frequency of 533 MHz, and includes 1 GB of DDR2 800/6400 memory as standard. North bridge chipset is Intel 945GSE and south bridge is Intel ICH7-M.http://www.samsung.com/us/support/downloads/NP- NC10-KA01UShttp://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=36331&code;=n270 NC10 may be equipped with DDR2 667 or 800 MHz, but 945GSE GMCH supports DDR2 400/533 MHz only, so there is no reason to install memory faster than 533 MHz (PC2-4200).http://download.intel.com/design/processor/datashts/309219.pdf Internally, the NC10 has one slot for memory accepting memory modules up to 2 GB. =Display= The screen is a non-glossy display and measures 10.2 inches (259 mm) diagonally, and has a resolution of 1024√ó600 pixels. An external display can be used through the standard VGA connector. =Keyboard= The 83-key keyboard is 93% of the size of a full-size keyboard, with 17.7 mm pitch between keys and 2 mm travel on each key press, with some reviews claiming it is the best keyboard of any netbook yet released. The keyboard has also been treated with the anti-bacterial Silver Nano technology. =Storage= The standard internal hard drive size is 160 GB on a SATA 1.5 Gbit/s interface. It also includes an SD card slot, supporting MMC, SD and SDHC cards for additional storage. The standard internal hard drive can be replaced with a Solid State Drive (SSD). =Problems with hardware= Some users noticed a white screen problem. After some time if the brightness is more than 40% screen goes completely white. It has been reported on various forums that the problem relates to a faulty cable between the screen and motherboard. Users have had success in getting this fixed under the Samsung factory warranty. A YouTube video provides a simple DIY solution to the issue by fastening some screws around the screen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn9BbEuv92I Sometimes the main board develops bad through holes which can cause very strange symptoms as mentioned earlier, \\"BigClive\\" has documented a fix for OLED breakout boards with this symptom and a pin from old AMD laptop CPU such as Sempron can be used as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M6rzAMi198 As these netbooks are quite old now the power switches and surrounding plastic are quite prone to failure. Repairing them is feasible and in the short term replacing it with a reed switch pair from old phones and small magnet does work as the switches are hard to find. Part numbers include BA81-0588CA but this is also used on other machines notably the AOA270 and some HP laptops. Also quite common with these are RAM failures, especially with the stock memory. It is believed that the failure is caused by deterioration in the memory chips used for serial presence detect and BIOS failures though rare do sometimes cause \\"black screen\\" similar to the early Aspire One units which can be recoverable using crisis boot disk and Alt Esc method. Another method is to replace the defective BIOS chip entirely, with essential bits copied from a second unit so that the laptop does not then throw a \\"BIOS password\\" related error; these usually cost between ¬£10 and ¬£18 An interesting note with these, the BIOS battery sometimes goes bad and replacing it can solve clock issues as well as being an \\"if all else fails\\" test before resorting to a chip replacement. Due to the way these are made it is sometimes feasible to make a new module using heatshrink, the old salvaged battery cables with nickel tags and some Z axis screen repair tape with blue cure nail varnish as an anti- vibration method if original batteries can't be shipped. Operating Systems =Windows platform= The NC10 was shipped with Windows XP Home Edition and can be upgraded to Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10. =Linux= Linux (e.g. Ubuntu Netbook Edition,Ubuntu ‚Äì Hardware Support for Netbooks Xubuntu, Lubuntu, or DebianDebian on NC10) runs well with the stock 1GB of RAM. =\\"Hackintosh\\" platform= The NC10 can be used as the platform to run Mac OS X using the IDeneb installation method. This combination of installing Apple's operating system on non-Apple hardware is often referred to as a \\"hackintosh\\" computer. In many cases, some features of either the hardware or software may not be totally functional or work as intended. There have been several such issues reported when using the NC10's default hardware. =Cloudready= The netbook can also be effectively turned into a \\"Chromebook\\" by installing the Cloudready operating system by Neverware. The Newest version does work on the NC10, though the SIM slot is not functional. Colors and configurations The NC10 is available in different colors and configurations. Colors include white, black, blue and pink. The configurations may differ in the lack of Bluetooth, e.g. in Spanish markets and some models in German markets, the fitting of a UMTS/HSDPA module, a weaker battery, or a stronger battery and a slightly bigger but non-multitouch touchpad as \\"special edition\\", available in the US. The new model N110 is an upgrade of the basic NC10 design, with improved battery life, modified touchpad and improved styling.

The lane begins at a T-junction with Gogolevsky Boulevard and runs west, roughly parallel to Arbat Street (north) and Prechistenka Street (south), ending at a T-junction with Denezhny Lane, one block short of the Garden Ring. The name of the lane, literally Sivka stream gully, refers to a historical stream now locked in an underground sewer and is only one of two Vrazheks in present-day Moscow (the other being Kozhevnichesky Vrazhek west of Novospassky Bridge). History No. 27, once owned by Alexander Herzen's father Nos. 8 and 6, early 20th century luxury apartments Sivka Stream ran eastward along the present-day lane into Chertoryi Stream that flowed southward on site of present-day Gogolevsky Boulevard into Moskva River. In the 18th century Sivka was locked into an open stone-clad ditch, opening up space for a proper lane, and in the first quarter of the 19th century the ditch was rebuilt into an underground sewer. In the 15th and 16th centuries Sivtsev Vrazhek was part of a road connecting Moscow with Smolensk. The area prospered since taking of Smolensk by Vasily III, but, in the end of the 16th century, construction of Bely Gorod fortress walls separated the street from the center of Moscow; the Smolensk highway changed its track in favor of Arbat Street, and Sivtsev Vrazhek became a quiet residential street. During the 17th century the area was fragmented into four slobodas of different trades employed by the Court: from east to west, these were icon painters, horse grooms, carpenters and mint workers. All of these trades are retained in the names of north‚Äìsouth lanes crossing Sivtsev Vrazhek.Sytin, p. 173 The crisis of Moscow economy caused by Peter I depopulated these slobodas, and in the first half of the 18th century their lands were taken over by aristocracy. The area was dominated by wooden estate houses placed on spacious garden lots, with very few stone buildings.Pamyatniki, p. 97 By the end of the 18th century the area was home to Moscow's oldest, but not necessarily the wealthiest, noble families.Sytin, p. 174 All of the building of this period perished in the Fire of 1812; after the fire, it was repopulated by the same upper-class families. Notable 19th-century residents included Peter Kropotkin, Alexander Herzen, count Fyodor Tolstoy \\"The American\\", Sergey Aksakov; general Yermolov owned the building on the corner of Boulevard Ring but himself lived on Prechistenka Street. In 1863 Leo Tolstoy wrote in his diary that he dreamed of his own place in Sivtsev Vrazhek where he could spend the winter months in country style.Pamyatniki, p. 101 In the end of the 19th century the old aristocratic mansions on the north side of the lane were gradually replaced by mid-rise, upper- and middle-class apartment buildings; the process was interrupted by World War I and the Russian Civil War. The only building added in the interbellum period was a 1932 experimental apartment block designed by Dmitry Lebedev and Nikolai Ladovsky, notable for its combination of segments linked at 120¬∞ angle.No. 15/25, completed 1932. Dmitry Lebedev was the lead architect. Some sources credit Ladovsky directly as a co-author, some, like the official Moscow Heritage Register - as \\"probable\\". More contemporary buildings were added in the 1950s and 1980s (most of them on the north side). The lane has been converted to one-way (westbound) traffic in the 1990s.

She has performed at live concerts onstage as an animated projection along with Crypton Future Media's other Vocaloids (like Hatsune Miku). She was the fourth Vocaloid ever released and the first to sing in Japanese. The name of the character comes directly from her voice provider's name, Haig≈ç Meiko. Meiko's codename was \\"Hanako\\"; it likely came from , a placeholder name for female characters, and the Japanese equivalent to \\"Jane Smith\\". \\"Megumi\\" was also a name considered during her development. Development Meiko was developed by Yamaha and sold by Crypton Future Media. Her voice was created by taking vocal samples from singer Meiko Haig≈ç at a controlled pitch and tone. =Additional software= A Vocaloid 2 update for Meiko was in development, but was canceled after it failed to meet the deadline. A beta version of the vocals were used in Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai. On February 4, 2014, a new version of Meiko, called Meiko V3, was released. It contained four Japanese vocals(Power, Straight, Dark and Whisper) and an English vocal. Once imported into the Vocaloid 4 engine, the four Japanese voices can access the Cross- Synthesis(XSY) function. Marketing Meiko was positively received and sold well compared to her counterpart Kaito, originally being the most popular of the two. For a long time she was the best selling Crypton Future Media Vocaloid, selling 3,000+ units. This lasted until the release of Hatsune Miku. 3,000+ units was three times the number of sales she needed to sell to be classified as successful. By 2010, whereas Kaito appeared in the Crypton ranking of their best-selling products, Meiko had fallen from popularity, receiving the least amount of attention of the Crypton Vocaloids. In the same year, Meiko was ranked as the seventh most popular Vocaloid product they sold and the least popular of Crypton Future Media's own Vocaloids. On December 10, 2011, Meiko, along with the Kagamines' append, were the only Vocaloid software packages not on the top ten list. A month after Meiko V3's release, Meiko took the number one spot on the charts. This was the first time Meiko had ever held a spot in the top 10 since the charts began. However, her number one spot was short lived, and by April she had dropped to the number three spot. This was a much faster fall from number one than Kaito V3, who managed to stay in the position for several months after release. Meiko soon fell behind Kaito V3 in popularity, constantly being one or two places behind his package. By August 2014, Meiko V3 was in sixth spot, while Kaito V3 held the third-place position, losing out only to Hatsune Miku V3 who claimed the number one and number two spot in the ranking. She also lost out this particular month to the Kagamine Rin/Len Vocaloid 2 package, which had temporarily returned to the rankings. Characteristics Crypton confirmed that Meiko's image on her package had nothing to do with her image, but her anime-based appearance appealed to a mainstream audience and the software sold well. As of V3, the image on the box is fully accepted as her official mascot.

His title, however, continued to be used socially and in news reports. Cuevas and his wife sponsored an exhibition in 1940 at the New York World's Fair that included old masters and French moderns borrowed from private collections and valued at $30 million. He founded a new ballet company as the Ballet International in New York City in 1944, performing at a now-destroyed theater in Columbus Circle. The company was variously called the Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo or the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas, but was most commonly called The de Cuevas Ballet by theatergoers. Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas flyer for performances on 5 October 1954. From the Marquis de Cuevas Collection at Ailina Dance Archives. In 1947, Rosella Hightower accepted an invitation from Cuevas to join his new ballet company. The presence there of choreographer Bronislava Nijinska was one of the major factors in Hightower's decision. Nijinska choreographed for Hightower the \\"glitteringly virtuosic\\" Rondo Capriccioso. In addition to classic dances, Hightower's performances included Pi√®ge de Lumi√®re by John Taras, the troupe's choreographer and balletmaster, in which she danced the role of a butterfly in a tropical forest who enchants a group of escaped convicts.Anderson, Jack. \\"Rosella Hightower, Prima Ballerina and School Founder, Is Dead at 88\\", The New York Times (4 November 2008).

The duel was precipitated by an argument over changes to Black and White (Suite en Blanc), a ballet by Lifar that was being presented by the Cuevas ballet company. Lifar had his face slapped in public after insisting that he retained the rights to Black and White. Lifar sent his seconds to Cuevas who refused to extend an apology and chose to duel with swords. As duels had been \\"technically outlawed\\" in the 17th Century, the time and location of the duel were not disclosed to the public.Staff. \\"Season of Duels Opens in France; Marquis de Cuevas, 72, Is Challenged by Dancer, 52, in Dispute Over Ballet\\", The New York Times, 25 March 1958.

The final success of his career was a production of The Sleeping Beauty that debuted in Paris in October 1960 and was well received by critics. His doctors allowed him to attend the ballet's premiere, with Cuevas noting that \\"if I am going to die, I will die backstage.\\" He was rolled onto the stage in a wheelchair after the performance to a standing ovation from the audience. George de Cuevas died at age 75 on 22 February 1961, at his villa, Les D√©lices, in Cannes. His troupe was to have opened Sleeping Beauty in Cannes the night after Cuevas died, and it canceled the performance in his memory.

With her marriage in July 2008, she changed her name to Claudia Crawford. Childhood  Claudia Wiesem√ºller was born in 1966 in Rostock, a city that was in East Germany. In her teenage years she was refused admission to a college preparatory school due to her participation in Catholic church youth activities. East German school officials required her to learn a trade before she could enroll in college, so whilst attending a technical secondary school in Rostock, she took vocational training in marine electronics from 1982 to 1984.

Whitney (December 15, 1994), Kohl Names Abortion Foe To Family Post in Cabinet The New York Times. From 1992 to 1994 she was a member of Thuringia CDU. On 18 November 1994 Nolte became the Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. She was 28 years old, making her the youngest German cabinet minister in German history. She was also one of only three women in the Cabinet and one of only two people from eastern Germany in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 16-member Cabinet; the other was Environment Minister Angela Merkel.Craig R. Whitney (December 15, 1994), Kohl Names Abortion Foe To Family Post in Cabinet The New York Times. On 30 November 1994 she was named the Council of the European Union‚Äôs President - again the youngest ever. In 1998 she left the German cabinet when her party joined the opposition. From 1996 to 2000 Nolte was a member of the CDU presiding council in Germany and from January 1999 to October 2002 she was commissioner of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group for disabled people. From 2002 to 2005, Nolte was vice chairman for United Nations contacts in the German parliament. In 2005 she failed to win a direct seat in the Bundestag representing the Gotha Ilm county electoral district. Under Germany's electoral law she was eligible to return to the German Federal Parliament via the state list in May 2008, but she declined. Later career In January 2006, Nolte moved to Belgrade where she directed the activities of a political foundation, heading the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung offices in Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. In April 2010 she moved to London where she headed the activities of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung offices in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 2013 she moved to Moscow where she heads the Konrad- Adenauer-Stiftung offices in Russia. She is a member of the German American Society, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, Christlich-Demokratische Arbeitnehmerschaft (CDA) and of CDU/CSU's association of medium-sized businesses Mittelstands- und Wirtschaftsvereinigung (MIT).

(1991). The altruism question: Toward a social-psychological answer. Hillsdale: Erlbaum Associates.Batson, C.D. (1987). Prosocial motivation: Is it ever truly altruistic? In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 20, pp. 65-122). New York: Academic Press. These other-oriented emotions include feelings of tenderness, sympathy, compassion, soft-heartedness, and the like. Empathic concern is often and wrongly confused with empathy. To empathize is to respond to another's perceived emotional state by experiencing feeling of a similar sort. Empathic concern or sympathy not only include empathizing, but also entails having a positive regard or a non-fleeting concern for the other person.Chismar, D. (1988). Empathy and sympathy: the important difference. The Journal of Value Inquiry, 22, 257-266. Definition C. Daniel Batson is one pioneer of the term. His mature definition of the term is \\"other-oriented emotion elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need\\".Batson, C.D. (2011). Altruism in Humans, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 11. Batson explains this definition in the following way: Many writers other than Batson use different terms for this construct or very similar constructs. Especially popular-- perhaps more popular than \\"empathic concern\\"--are sympathy, compassion or pity.These are used by numerous philosophers and social scientists including Charles Darwin, Frans de Waal, Nancy Eisenberg, and Stephen Darwall, as documented in Batson's Altruism in Humans, p. 12. Other terms include the tender emotion and sympathetic distress.These latter two terms are due, respectively, to William McDougall and Martin Hoffman. See Batson, C.D. (2011). Altruism in Humans, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 12. Human beings are strongly motivated to be connected to others.Batson, C.D. (1990). How social an animal? The human capacity for caring. American Psychologist 45: 336-346. In humans and higher mammals, an impulse to care for offspring is almost certainly genetically hard-wired, although modifiable by circumstance. Evolutionary origins At the behavioral level it is evident from the descriptions of comparative psychologists and ethologists that behaviors homologous to empathic concern can be observed in other mammalian species. Notably, a variety of reports on ape empathic reactions suggest that, apart from emotional connectedness, apes have an explicit appreciation of the other's situation.De Waal, F.B.M. (1996). Good Natured: The origins of right and wrong in humans and other animals. Harvard: Harvard University Press. Harvard: Harvard University A good example is consolation, defined as reassurance behavior by an uninvolved bystander towards one of the combatants in a previous aggressive incident.De Waal, F.B.M., & van Roosmalen, A. (1979). Reconciliation and consolation among chimpanzees. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 5, 55-66. Developmental origins Empathic concern is thought to emerge later developmental and to require more self-control than either emotional contagion or personal distress.Eisenberg, N., & Strayer, J. (1997). Empathy and its Development. New York: Cambridge University Press. Developmental research indicates a broad range of social competencies children bring to their interpersonal relationships.Decety, J., & Meyer, M. (2008). From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account. Development and Psychopathology, 20, 1053-1080. As early as 2 years of age, they show (a) the cognitive capacity to interpret, in simple ways, the physical and psychological states of others, (b) the emotional capacity to experience, affectively, the state of others, and (c) the behavioral repertoire that permits the possibility of attempts to alleviate discomfort in others.Zahn-Waxler, C, Radke-Yarrow, M., Wagner, E., & Chapman, M. (1992). Development of concern for others. Developmental Psychology, 28, 126-136. Both personal disposition such as temperament and social context contribute to individual differences in concern for others. Some developmental psychologists have hypothesized that empathic concern for others are essential factors inhibiting aggression toward others.Eisenberg, N., & Eggum, N.D. (2009). Empathic responding: sympathy and personal distress. In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp 71-83.Hoffman, M.L. (2000). Empathy and Moral Development. New York: Cambridge University Press. Contribution of social psychology Empathic concern may produce an altruistic motivation to reduce the other person's distress.Batson, C.D., & Shaw, L.L. (1991). Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives. Psychological Inquiry, 2, 107-122). The challenge of demonstrating the existence of altruistic motivation is to show how empathic concern leads to helping in ways that cannot be explained by prevailing theories of egoistic motivation. That is, a clear case needs to be made that it is concern about the other person's welfare, not a desire to improve one's own welfare, that primarily drives one's helping behavior in a particular situation. Empirical studies conducted by social psychologist Daniel Batson have demonstrated that empathic concern is felt when one adopts the perspective of another person in need. His work emphasizes the different emotions evoked when imagining another situation from a self-perspective or imagining from another perspective.Batson, C.D. (2009). Two forms of perspective taking: imagining how another feels and imagining how you would feel. In K.D. Markman, W.M.P. Klein and J.A. Suhr (Eds.), Handbook of Imagination and Mental Simulation (pp. 267-279). New York: Psychology Press. The former is often associated with personal distress (i.e., feelings of discomfort and anxiety), whereas the latter leads to empathic concern. Social neuroscience evidence Social neuroscience explores the biological underpinnings of empathic concern and more generally interpersonal sensitivity, using an integrative approach that bridges the biological and social levels.Decety, J., & Keenan, J.P. (2006). Social neuroscience: A new journal. Social Neuroscience, 1, 1-4. Neural systems, including autonomic functions, that rely on brain stem neuropeptides, such as oxytocin and vasopressin, are plausible correlates for empathic concern. Alternatively, vasopressin might be implicated in situations where a more active strategy is required for an effective response.Carter, C.S., Harris, J., & Porges, S.W. (2009). Neural and evolutionary perspectives on empathy In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT press, pp 169-182. An association between executive functions, underpinned by the prefrontal cortex with reciprocal connections with the limbic system, the sense of agency, and empathic concern has been suggested based on lesion studies in neurological patients and functional neuroimaging experiments in healthy individuals.Decety, J., & Jackson, P.L. (2004). The functional architecture of human empathy. Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews, 3, 71-100. The difference between imaging self versus imaging other is supported by a series of functional neuroimaging studies of affective processing. For instance, Lamm, Batson and Decety (2007) found that participants reported more empathic concern when imagining the pain of others when adopting another perspective, and more personal distress when imagining themselves to be in pain.Lamm, C., Batson, C.D., & Decety, J. (2007). The neural substrate of human empathy: effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19, 42-58. The fMRI scans revealed that imagining self in pain was associated with strong activation in brain areas involved in affective response to threat and pain, including the amygdala, insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Imagine-other instructions produced higher activity in the right temporoparietal junction (or TPJ), which is associated with self-other distinctiveness and the sense of agency.

Picking up shortly after the end of Thunder Oak, the novel centres on the anthropomorphised weasels searching for the humans that mysteriously vanished from their homeland many years before. Following a clue found in the first book, the weasels, led by the outlaw Sylver and pursued by the stoat Sheriff Falshed, journey to a far-away city where they find themselves entangled in a battle between rivalling clans of squirrels. Published in Germany under the title \\"Belagert die Sturmburg.\\" Synopsis After discovering the second clue to the whereabouts of the humans lies at the famed Castle Storm, the outlaw weasels journey to the south of Welkin, where the castle lies, to discover more about the mysterious human evacuation. However, a cascade of rats is swarming down from the marshes in the north of the island to seize power from Prince Poynt. Plot In the unnamed marshes in the north of Welkin, the evil stoat lord Flaggatis plots to eradicate Prince Poynt's grip on power. He sends his evil rats to commence a massive war against the stoats. His main attack source is Castle Rayn, home of the stoats, but he also has other targets, too: County Elleswhere, home of Sylver's band, and County Fearsomeshire, home of Lord Ragnar. Prince Poynt and his stoats are overwhelmed, 'in their beds', as Flaggatis hopes, but not before a ferret messenger is sent to Lord Haukin, ruler of Halfmoon Wood. In the wood, Sylver's band corner the ferret and eventually, when Sylver arrives, they listen to his story. Lord Flaggatis has built a massive wooden god-effigy, more like a monstrous white rat than anything else. After hearing the ferret's alarming tale, the weasels consider what to do and decide to support the stoats in their battle against the rats, as the rats are the enemies of all of Welkin and the weasels start to travel to Castle Rayn. They eventually reach it, although they have to contend with several cowardly stoat mercenaries upon the way, who have deserted the war out of fear of the rats, but eventually the cowardly stoat soldiers join the weasels to attack the rats. The weasels send Scirf and Mawk in to infiltrate the castle, and they eventually enter, but the weasels are captured by Prince Poynt in the process, who throws them in his dungeons. Mawk the doubter convinces their guard to play a game of hollyhockers with him, and appears to lose, but later he reveals that he held the guard's key to the weasels' cell in his mouth all along. After slipping through a grating cover, the weasels worm their way down through the underground rivers and enter an otter colony, where they meet Sleek, an otter obsessed with fashion. Back at Castle Rayn, Prince Poynt appears cleverer than he looks, and tells Sheriff Falshed to follow the weasels and obstruct them in their quest. After allowing him to free them, the weasels then enter an open lake where they meet their old friend Sheriff Falshed, who has been knocked unconscious by the fall from the cliff. After contending with some rats and a giant dragonfly nymph, carnivorous in nature (carnivorous meaning mammal- eating, rather than insect eating) Sheriff Falshed fakes amnesia, and thus the weasels finally make their way to the castle, leaving Sleek the otter to go his own way (to find a fashion industry). Sheriff Falshed fakes amnesia throughout the entire voyage to Castle Storm, where the weasels meet a massive rivalry between the grey squirrels and the highly arrogant red squirrels. The red squirrels are led by Clive of Coldkettle, who sports an extra-large tail, and the grey squirrels are led by Pommf de Fritte. The weasels are accepted by the reds, and are shown around town by Clive, where Sylver encounters a coven of moles, who, much to Sylver's alarm, proclaim him to be Lord of Elleswhere. The weasels are invited to a tournament, where, to their horror, their friend Icham is killed by Torca Marda. Icham dies despite an attempt to revive him by a good stoat doctor. After a feast that night, where the weasels meet two evil ferrets called Rosencrass and Guildenswine, who plot to kill Prince Poynt, and an extremely evil stoat called Torca Marda, who killed Sylver's father. The weasels then journey down beneath the castle to search for the clue, and narrowly avoid death when Torca Marda attempts to kill the weasels by resurrecting a badger, although they kill the fiend by stabbing it with a raptor's claw. Then the dragonfly from the lake breaks out of its aquatic nature and attacks the castle, devouring any creature in its path. The coven of moles, still intent on Sylver being a lord, suggest that they should feed the old and weak animals to the ravenous beast, and Torca Marda agrees on this mad plan. Wodehed the magician comes up with a solution to the problem of the dragonfly: they must journey to the Forest of Lost Birds and retrieve a secret herb, known as Shatter from the goddess Sessile's garden. Sessile is a sentient tree, and in her roots another dimension resides. On their way to the forest, they run into, and escape, a group of birds who are obsessed with the idea of returning home to their island via a ship of Braeburns, and then are attacked by Rosencrass and Guildenswine, who, upon revealing that they have murdered one of the birds, are imprisoned in the trees of the Forest of Lost Birds. The weasels retrieve the herb, return to Castle Storm, and destroy the dragonfly, whereupon it shatters into small, harmless dragonflies. Torca Marda, furious at this loss of chaos, attempts to kill Sylver, but is scared off by Scirf, pretending to be an animal dying from the mange, and falls over a cliff to his death. His priests, attempting to shatter the squirrels into pieces with the herb, are themselves turned into minuscule stoats by the same herb and Welkin is free of the evil of Torca Marda. The next day Lord Ragnar is killed in battle with the rats, and Prince Poynt promises to elect Sylver to a lord if he defeats the rats, thus fulfilling the mole coven's prophecy. Lord Haukin tells Sylver and the weasels to partially knock down the sea walls, allowing a bore to flood to Castle Rayn and destroy the rat hordes, along with the effigy, although Lord Flaggatis escapes, along with most of the rats. The otter Sleek comes to Castle Rayn to make a fashion industry with the stoat princess, Prince Poynt's sister, (who secretly fancies Falshed) and the prince is left to his misery, thinking gloomily about his murdered brother, King Redfur (Poynt refuses to be king as all the previous stoat kings were murdered) who often enters his mind when he is feeling depressed. The novel ends with Poynt overlooking a massive inland saltlake which now spreads around his castle, whereas in the rest of Welkin the sea begins to cascade down into the land.

Puns, references, and literary allusions * The name Torca Marda is derived from that of Tom√°s de Torquemada, underscoring his brutal interrogation methods. * The names Rosencrass and Guildenswine are plays on those of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from Shakespeare's Hamlet. The play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is possibly also referred to, as the first reaction of everyone who meets the ferrets is \\"I heard you two were dead.\\" * Falshed's ramblings when he fakes insanity may have been inspired by the dialogue of Edgar in the guise of Tom o' Bedlam in Shakespeare's King Lear. They also contain many references to other works: ** \\"Ho! See, a candle flame in yon window niche burns brightly, sire. It must be that Lady M walks at this midnight hour!\\" ‚Äì Shakespeare's Macbeth. ** \\"Young Lochinvar has stolen my bride\\" ‚Äì Sir Walter Scott's Marmion. ** \\"What, sir, will you not listen to an elderly mariner?\\" ‚Äì Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. ** \\"Here's bladderwort ‚Äì that's for remembrance ...\\" ‚Äì Shakespeare's Hamlet. ** \\"The moving coffee pot pours, and having poured moves on ...\\" ‚Äì Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. * Darkmoor may be a reference to the real place Dartmoor. * The name Sessile comes from the common name for Quercus petraea, the Sessile Oak. * The name Pommf de Fritte comes from \\"pommes frites\\", the French name for French fries. * The name Poisson d'Avril comes from a French April Fools' Day tradition. * The name Derri√®re comes from the French word meaning 'bottom,' a point for which the character is the butt of many jokes. * The name Furioso comes from the Italian epic Orlando Furioso. * The name Orgoglio comes from that of a character in Edmund Spenser's epic The Faerie Queene, which was heavily inspired by Orlando Furioso. * The mole coven and their addressing of Sylver as \\"Thane of County Elleswhere\\" are allusions to the witches of Shakespeare's Macbeth. * Poynt's complaint \\"Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?\\" before his banishment of Torca Marda is a reference to the story of Thomas Becket. * \\"Patent number 101\\", the torture device Torca Marda uses on Falshed, is a reference to the book Nineteen Eighty-Four's \\"Room 101\\". In Nineteen Eighty-Four, the character Winston is tortured with the threat of having a wire cage of rats strapped to his face. \\"Patent number 101\\" is a wire helmet with two attached cages full of earwigs, which works in a similar way. * The squirrel Link leading the weasels through the secret passages may be a reference to the game The Legend of Zelda. * The claw-of-glory which must be used to kill the ghoul is based on the legendary Hand of Glory.

Location It is situated close to Nantwich's boundary with Henhull, on the north side of Welsh Row (part of the Nantwich-Chester road), and east of the Shropshire Union Canal. History =Grammar school= Malbank School originates in three schools. The oldest is the original Nantwich Grammar School, first recorded in 1572, but believed to have been founded in around 1560.Hall J. A History of the Town and Parish of Nantwich, or Wich Malbank, in the County Palatine of Chester, pp. 373‚Äì82 (2nd edn) (E. J. Morten; 1972) ()Lamberton A, Gray R. Lost Houses in Nantwich, p. 54 (Landmark Publishing; 2005) () The original schoolhouse was in the churchyard of St Mary's Church. In 1860 the school amalgamated with the Blue Cap Charity School, which was founded in around 1700, to form the new Nantwich Grammar School, and moved to 108 Welsh Row, where the former schoolhouse and headmaster's house still stands. In 1885, it combined with Acton Grammar School, becoming Nantwich and Acton Grammar School or NAGS. It moved to its present site in 1921. The horses on the school coat of arms were added purely because of the NAGS acronym.'' In 1960, the school celebrated its 400th anniversary, with the Duchess of Gloucester attending the school prize-giving on 18 November 1960. On the occasion, the Nantwich Guardian reported that the \\"school of ancient history had turned into one of the most up-to-date in the County, catering for all the widely varying needs of individual children.\\" =Comprehensive= Nantwich and Acton Grammar School became a comprehensive school in 1977.

These boarding schools were first established by Christian missionaries of various denominations, who often started schools on reservations, especially in the lightly populated areas of the West. The government paid religious orders to provide basic education to Native American children on reservations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the last residential schools closing as late as 1973. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) founded additional boarding schools based on the assimilation model of the off-reservation Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Children were typically immersed in European-American culture through forced changes that removed indigenous cultural signifiers. These methods included being forced to have European-American style haircuts, being forbidden to speak their Indigenous languages, and having their real names replaced by European names to both \\"civilize\\" and \\"Christianize\\" them. The experience of the schools was usually harsh and sometimes deadly, especially for the younger children who were forcibly separated from their families. The children were forced to abandon their Native American identities and cultures. Investigations of the later twentieth century have revealed many documented cases of sexual, manual, physical and mental abuse occurring mostly in church- run schools. In summarizing the recent scholarship from Native perspectives, Dr. Julie Davis argues: Since those years, tribal nations have increasingly insisted on community-based schools and have also founded numerous tribal colleges and universities. Community schools have also been supported by the federal government through the BIA and legislation. The largest boarding schools have closed. By 2007, most of the schools had been closed down and the number of Native American children in boarding schools had declined to 9,500. During this same period, more Native Americans moved to urban environments accommodating in varying degrees and manners to majority culture. History of education of Native Americans In the late eighteenth century, reformers starting with Washington and Knox, in efforts to \\"civilize\\" or otherwise assimilate Native Americans (as opposed to relegating them to reservations), adopted the practice of assimilating Native American children in current American culture, which was at the time largely based on rural agriculture, with some small towns and few large cities. The Civilization Fund Act of 1819 promoted this civilization policy by providing funding to societies (mostly religious) who worked on Native American education, often at schools established in or near Native American communities. Moses Tom sent his children to an Indian boarding school. One fact that many may not be aware of is the fact that Native Americans had a good education system before being forced to attend boarding schools. They even had one of the first women's colleges. Non-reservation boarding schools In 1634, Fr. Andrew White of the Society of Jesus established a mission in what is now the state of Maryland, and the purpose of the mission, stated through an interpreter to the chief of a Native American tribe there, was \\"to extend civilization and instruction to his ignorant race, and show them the way to heaven.\\"Foley, Henry. Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus. 1875. London: Burns and Oates. p. 352. The mission's annual records report that by 1640, they had founded a community they named St. Mary's, and Native Americans were sending their children there \\"to be educated among the English\\",Foley, p. 379 including the daughter of the Pascatoe chief Tayac. This was either a school for girls, or an early co-ed school. The same records report that in 1677, \\"a school for humanities was opened by our Society in the centre of Maryland, directed by two of the Fathers; and the native youth, applying themselves assiduously to study, made good progress. Maryland and the recently established school sent two boys to St. Omer who yielded in abilities to few Europeans, when competing for the honour of being first in their class. So that not gold, nor silver, nor the other products of the earth alone, but men also are gathered from thence to bring those regions, which foreigners have unjustly called ferocious, to a higher state of virtue and cultivation.\\"Foley, p. 394 Harvard College had an \\"Indian College\\" on its campus in the mid-1600s, supported by the English Society for Propagation of the Gospel. Its few Native American students came from New England, at a time when higher education was very limited for all classes and colleges were more similar to today's high schools. In 1665, Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, \\"from the Wampanoag...did graduate from Harvard, the first Indian to do so in the colonial period\\".Monaghan, E. J., Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America, University of Massachusetts Press. Boston: MA, 2005, pp. 55, 59 In early years, other Indian schools were created by local communities, as with the Indian school in Hanover, New Hampshire, in 1769, which gradually developed into Dartmouth College. Other schools were created in the East, where Indian reservations were less common than they became in the late nineteenth century in western states. West of the Mississippi, schools near indigenous settlements and on reservations were first founded by religious missionaries, who believed they could extend education and Christianity to Native Americans. Some of their efforts were part of the progressive movement after the Civil War. As Native Americans were forced onto reservations following the Indian Wars, missionaries founded additional schools with boarding facilities, as children were enrolled very far from their communities and were not permitted to travel home or receive parental visitation. Carlisle Indian Industrial School  Chiricahua Apaches Four Months After Arriving at Carlisle. Undated photograph taken at Carlisle Indian Industrial School. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School, founded by the Civil War Lieutenant Richard Henry Pratt in 1879 at a former military installation, became a model for others established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The Carlisle Indian Industrial School forced assimilation to Christian culture and lose their Native American traditions, as demonstrated by their motto, ‚ÄúKill the Indian, Save the Man.‚Äù Pratt said in a speech in 1892, \\"A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one. In a sense, I agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race should be dead.\\"Charla Bear, \\"American Indian Boarding Schools Haunt Many\\", Part 1, NPR, 12 May 2008, accessed 5 July 2011 Comanche Chief Tosahwi is reported to have had an exchange with Philip Sheridan where Sheridan purportedly stated \\"The only good Indians I ever saw were dead\\", which was sometimes rephrased as \\"the only good Indian is a dead Indian.\\" In Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Dee Brown attributed the quote to Sheridan, stating that \\"Lieutenant Charles Nordstrom, who was present, remembered the words and passed them on, until in time they were honed into an American aphorism: The only good Indian is a dead Indian.Dee Brown, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1970), 170-172 While Sheridan later denied making either statement, biographer Roy Morris Jr. states that, nevertheless, popular history credits Sheridan with saying \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\\" This variation \\"has been used by friends and enemies ever since to characterize and castigate his Indian-fighting career.\\"Taylor, Morris F. \\"The Carr‚ÄìPenrose Expedition: General Sheridan's Winter Campaign, 1868‚Äì1869.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma 51#2 (June 1973): 159‚Äì76., p. 328. Pratt professed \\"assimilation through total immersion.\\" He conducted a \\"social experiment\\" on Apache prisoners of war at a fort in Florida. He cut their long hair, put them in uniforms, forced them to learn English, and subjected them to strict military protocols. He had arranged for the education of some of the young Native American men at the Hampton Institute, now a historically black college, after he had supervised them as prisoners at a fort in Florida. Hampton Institute was established in the 1870s and in its original form, created a formal education program for Native Americans in 1875 at the end of the American Indian Wars. The United States Army sent seventy-two warriors from the Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche and Caddo Nations, to imprisonment and exile in St. Augustine, Florida. Essentially they were considered hostages to persuade their peoples in the West to keep peace. From this funding Hampton was able to grow into a university, though over time the student population shifted to African-American students. At the prison, he tried to inculcate Native Americans with Anglo-American culture, while giving them some leeway to govern themselves. As at the Hampton Institute, he included in the Carlisle curriculum vocational training for boys and domestic science for girls, including chores around the school and producing goods for market. They also produced a newspaper, had a well-regarded chorus and orchestra, and developed sports programs. The vocational training reflected the administration's understanding of skills needed at most reservations, which were located in rural areas, and reflected a society still based on agriculture. In the summer students often lived with local farm families and townspeople, reinforcing their assimilation, and providing labor at low cost to the families. Carlisle and its curriculum became the model for the Bureau of Indian Affairs; by 1902 there were 25 federally funded non-reservation schools in 15 states and territories, with a total enrollment of over 6,000 students. Federal legislation required Native American children to be educated according to Anglo-American settler-colonial standards. Parents had to authorize their children's attendance at boarding schools, and if they refused officials could use coercion to gain a quota of students from any given reservation. As the model of boarding schools was adopted more widely by the US government, many Native American children were separated from their families and tribes when they were sent or sometimes taken to boarding schools far from their home reservations. These schools ranged from those similar to the federal Carlisle Indian Industrial School, which became a model for BIA-run schools, to the many schools sponsored by religious denominations. In this period, when students arrived at boarding schools their lives altered dramatically. They were given short haircuts (a source of shame for boys of many tribes), uniforms, and English names; sometimes these were based on their own, other times they were assigned at random. They were not allowed to speak their own languages, even between each other, and they were forced to attend church services and convert to Christianity. Discipline was stiff in many schools, and it often included chores, solitary confinement and corporal punishment including beatings with sticks, rulers and belts.cite Jennifer Jones, Dee Ann Bosworth, Amy Lonetree, \\"American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing\\", Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture & Lifeways, 2011, accessed 25 January 2014 The following is a quote from Anna Moore regarding the Phoenix Indian School: Legality  In 1891,http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History- idx?type=turn&entity;=History.AnnRep91p1.p0025&id;=History.AnnRep91p1&isize;=M the government issued a ‚Äúcompulsory attendance‚Äù law that enabled federal officers to forcibly take Native American children from their home and reservation. The American government believed they were rescuing these children from a world of poverty and depression and teaching them \\"life skills\\". Tabatha Tooney Booth, from the University of Oklahoma wrote in her paper, Cheaper Than Bullets, ‚ÄúMany parents had no choice but to send their kids, when Congress authorized the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to withhold rations, clothing, and annuities of those families that refused to send students. Some agents even used reservation police to virtually kidnap youngsters, but experienced difficulties when the Native police officers would resign out of disgust, or when parents taught their kids a special ‚Äúhide and seek‚Äù game. Sometimes resistant fathers found themselves locked up for refusal. In 1895, nineteen men of the Hopi Nation were imprisoned to Alcatraz because they refused to send their children to boarding school. However, in 1978, the Indian Child Welfare Act gave Native American parents the legal right to deny their child's placement in the school. Damning evidence against the morality of Non-Reservation boarding schools contributed to the enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Congress approved of this act in 1978 after first-hand accounts of life in Native American boarding schools. National Indian Child Welfare Association explains, Meriam Report of 1928 In 1926, the Department of the Interior (DOI) commissioned the Brookings Institution to conduct a survey of the overall conditions of the American Indians and to assess federal programs and policies. The Meriam Report, officially titled The Problem of Indian Administration, was submitted February 21, 1928, to the Secretary of the Interior Hubert Work. Related to education of Native American children, it recommended that the government: * Abolish The Uniform Course of Study, which taught only European-American cultural values; * Educate younger children at community schools near home, and have older children attend non- reservation schools for higher grade work; * Have the Indian Service (now Bureau of Indian Affairs) provide American Indians the education and skills they need to adapt both in their own communities and United States society. Despite the Meriam Report, attendance in Indian boarding schools generally grew throughout the first half of the 20th century and doubled in the 1960s. Enrollment reached its highest point in the 1970s. In 1973, 60,000 American Indian children are estimated to have been enrolled in an Indian boarding school.Smith, Andrea. \\"Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools\\", Amnesty Magazine, from Amnesty International website, The rise of pan-Indian activism, tribal nations' continuing complaints about the schools, and studies in the late 1960s and mid-1970s (such as the Kennedy Report and the National Study of American Indian Education) led to passage of the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. This emphasized decentralization of students from boarding schools to community schools. As a result, many large Indian boarding schools closed in the 1980s and early 1990s. By 2007, 9,500 American Indian children were living in Indian boarding school dormitories. This figure includes those in 45 on-reservation boarding schools, seven off-reservation boarding schools, and 14 peripheral dormitories. From 1879 to the present day, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Native Americans as children attended Indian boarding schools. Union of Ontario Indians press release: \\"Time will prove apology's sincerity\\", says Beaucage. Today, a few off-reservation boarding schools still operate, but funding for them is in decline. Disease and death  Throughout non- reservation boarding schools, students became easily susceptible to diseases, like trachoma, tuberculosis, and measles, and death. The overcrowding of the schools and the unfamiliar environment contributed to the rapid spread of disease within the schools. \\"An often-underpaid staff provided irregular medical care. And not least, apathetic boarding school officials frequently failed to heed their own directions calling for the segregation of children in poor health from the rest of the student body\\". Tuberculosis was especially deadly among students. Many children died while in custody at Indian Schools. Often students were prevented from communicating with their families, and parents were not notified when their children fell ill. Many times, children would pass away and the families never knew they were sick. \\"Many of the Indian deaths during the great influenza pandemic of 1918‚Äì19, which hit the Native American population hard, took place in boarding schools.\\" The 1928 Meriam Report noted that infectious disease was often widespread at the schools due to malnutrition, overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, and students weakened by overwork. The report said that death rates for Native American students were six and a half times higher than for other ethnic groups. Another report regarding the Phoenix Indian school stated, \\"In December of 1899, measles broke out at the Phoenix Indian School, reaching epidemic proportions by January. In its wake, 325 cases of measles, 60 cases of pneumonia, and 9 deaths were recorded in a 10-day period.\\"http://www.nativepartnership.org/site/PageServer?pagename=airc_hist_boardingschools\\" Implications of assimilation  The U.S. federal government recognized a need for assimilation of diverse people of color; specifically, assimilation of the Native Americans. From 1810 until 1917 the U.S. federal government subsidized the creation of and education within mission and boarding schools. \\"By 1885, 106 [Indian Schools] had been established, many of them on abandoned military installations\\" using military personnel and Indian prisoners Native American boarding schools in the United States were seen as the means for the government to achieve assimilation of Native Americans into mainstream American culture. Assimilation efforts included forcibly removing Native Americans from their families, converting them to Christianity, preventing them from learning or practicing indigenous culture and customs, and living in a strict military fashion. When students arrived at boarding schools, the routine was typically the same. First, the students were stripped of their tribal clothing and their hair was cut. Second, \\"[t]o instill the necessary discipline, the entire school routine was organized in martial fashion, and every facet of student life followed a strict timetable\\". Since many military personnel ran the boarding schools, military principles mechanized the daily routines. One student recalled, > A small bell was tapped, and each of the pupils drew a chair from under the > table. Supposing this act meant that they were to be seated, I pulled out > mine and at once slipped into it from one side. But when I turned my head, I > saw that I was the only one seated, and all the rest at our table remained > standing. Just as I began to rise, looking shyly around to see how chairs > were to be used, a second bell was sounded. All were seated at last, and I > had to crawl back into my chair again. I heard a man's voice at one end of > the hall, and I looked around to see him. But all the others hung their > heads over their plates. As I glanced at the long chain of tables, I cause > the eyes of a paleface woman upon me. Immediately I dropped my eyes, > wondering why I was so keenly watched by the strange woman. The man ceased > his mutterings, and then a third bell was tapped. Everyone picked up his > knife and fork and began eating. I began crying instead, for by this time I > was afraid to venture anything more. Besides mealtime routines, administrators 'educated' Indians on how to farm using European-based methods. Some boarding schools worked to become small agrarian societies where the school became its own self-sufficient community. From the moment students arrived at school, they could not \\"be Indian\\" in any way\\". To aid in their assimilation to U.S. Anglo culture, boarding school administrations \\"forbade, whether in school or on reservation, tribal singing and dancing, along with the wearing of ceremonial and 'savage' clothes, the practice of native religions, the speaking of tribal languages, the acting out of traditional gender roles\\". School administrators argued that young women needed to be specifically targeted due to their important place in continuing assimilation education in their future homes. Educational administrators and teachers were instructed that \\"Indian girls were to be assured that, because their grandmothers did things in a certain way, there was no reason for them to do the same\\". Reservation schools had been established to help students learn about the dominant European history of the U.S. However, \\"removal to reservations in the West in the early part of the century and the enactment of the Dawes or General Allotment Act in 1887 eventually took nearly 50 million acres of land from Indian control\\". On-reservation schools were either taken over by Anglo leadership or destroyed in the process. Indian-controlled school systems became non-existent while \\"the Indians [were] made captives of federal or mission education\\". Although schools used verbal corrective means to enforce assimilation, often more violent measures were used. Archuleta et al. (2000) noted cases where students had \\"their mouths washed out with lye soap when they spoke their native languages; they could be locked up in the guardhouse with only bread and water for other rule violations; and they faced corporal punishment and other rigid discipline on a daily basis\\". Beyond physical and mental abuse, some school authorities sexually abused students as well. One former student retold, > Intimidation and fear were very much present in our daily lives. For > instance, we would cower from the abusive disciplinary practices of some > superiors, such as the one who yanked my cousin's ear hard enough to tear > it. After a nine-year-old girl was raped in her dormitory bed during the > night, we girls would be so scared that we would jump into each other's bed > as soon as the lights went out. The sustained terror in our hearts further > tested our endurance, as it was better to suffer with a full bladder and be > safe than to walk through the dark, seemingly endless hallway to the > bathroom. When we were older, we girls anguished each time we entered the > classroom of a certain male teacher who stalked and molested girls. Women taken from their families and placed into boarding schools, such as the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, were moved to accomplish the U.S. federal government's vision of \\"educating Indian girls in the hope that women trained as good housewives would help their mates assimilate\\" into U.S. mainstream culture. Historian Brenda Child asserts that boarding schools cultivated pan-Indian-ism and made possible cross-tribal coalitions that have helped many different tribes collaborate in the 20th century. She argues: > People formerly separated by language, culture, and geography lived and > worked together in residential schools. Students formed close bonds and > enjoyed a rich cross-cultural change. Graduates of government schools often > married former classmates, found employment in the Indian Service, migrated > to urban areas, returned to their reservations and entered tribal politics. > Countless new alliances, both personal and political, were forged in > government boarding schools.Brenda J. Child, Boarding schools In Frederick > E. Hoxie, ed. Encyclopedia of North American Indians: Native American > History, Culture, and Life From Paleo-Indians to the Present (1996) p. 80 > online However, this analysis is not widespread amongst boarding school survivors, Native American communities, and particularly within the indigenous resurgence movement. Jacqueline Emery, introducing an anthology of boarding school writings, suggests that these writings prove that the children showed a cultural and personal resilience \\"more common among boarding school students than one might think\\": though the school authorities censored the material, it nonetheless demonstrates multiple methods of resistance to school regimes. Several students educated in boarding schools such as Gertrude Bonnin, Angel De Cora, Francis La Flesche, and Laura Cornelius Kellogg went on to become precursors to modern Indigenous resurgence activists. After release from Indian boarding schools, students were expected to return to their tribes and induce European assimilation there. Many students who returned to their reservations experienced alienation, language and cultural barriers, and confusion, in addition to the posttraumatic stress disorder and legacy of trauma resulting from abuse received in Indian boarding schools. They struggled to respect elders, but also received resistance from family and friends when trying to initiate Anglo-American changes. Since former students who were visited by faculty were rated as successful by the following criteria: \\"orderly households, 'citizen's dress', Christian weddings, 'well- kept' babies, land in severalty, children in school, industrious work habits, and leadership roles in promoting the same 'civilized' lifestyles among family and tribe\\", many students returned to the boarding schools. General Richard Henry Pratt, who was a main administrator, began to recognize that \\"[t]o civilize the Indian, get him into civilization. To keep him civilized, let him stay.\\" Economic repercussions  By controlling the environment and perspective of young Native Americans, the American government used non- reservation boarding schools as a cost-benefit alternative to military campaigns against Western Native Americans. The assimilation of young Native American children eliminated a generation of warriors that potentially posed a threat to US military. These schools also found an economic benefit in the children through their labor. Children often were forced to undertake laborious tasks in order to fund employment, and during the summers, children were \\"leased\\" to work on farms or in the household for wealthy families. Amnesty International argues, \\"In addition to bringing in income, the hard labor prepared children to take their place in white society‚Äîthe only one open to them‚Äîon the bottom rung of the socioeconomic ladder.‚Äù List of Native American boarding schools * Absentee Shawnee Boarding School, near Shawnee, Indian Territory, open 1893‚Äì99 * Albuquerque Indian School, Albuquerque, New MexicoCarter, Kent, compiler. \\"Preliminary Inventory of the Office of the Five Civilized Tribes Agency Muscogee Area of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (Record Group 75).

Eastern Orthodox Christians in Madagascar are under ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa.Orthodox Missionary Fraternity (2017): New projects, new blessings in Madagascar  History  Archdioceses and Dioceses of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa From its first beginnings, Christianity in Madagascar was spreading slowly. First, because of the people being faithful followers of the tribal religions. Even converted followers may show great influence of ancient tribal worship. Also, many settlements are isolated, so that missionaries can't visit them very often and locals may return to their cults. For many African countries, Eastern Orthodox Christianity was brought there by Greek traders. In 1953 in the capital Antananarivo, Greek colonists built an Eastern Orthodox temple. After the 1972 military coup, the church's priest was deported together with other foreigners. Eastern Orthodoxy was first brought for the local population here in 1994 by hieromonk Nectarios (Kellis) who arrived from Australia. After 5 years here, there were more than 12 thousand Eastern Orthodox Christians and those preparing to be christened. In Antananarivo, the capital, the temple of the Assumption of Mary was built, together with eparchial directorate and orphanage for several hundred children. On 26 of March 1995, during the Cross- Bow Week, in the Assumption Cathedral, Metropolitan Zimbabwean Chrysostom ordained deacon Ioann Rikotondrazafi as a presbyter. He is the first Malagasy priest. He became a deacon in the capital of Zimbabwe, the city of Harare. He studied the ministry for three months before that. The other local resident, Jean-Kristos Tsakanias, was sent to study in the seminary in Nairobi, Kenya. On the island by 1995 were 63 Eastern Orthodox parishes, seven schools and 12 priests who were locals. The Eastern Orthodox Church was recognized by the government of Madagascar. With the blessing of Patriarch Peter VII on 23 of September 1997 the Holy Synod of Alexandria Church elected Father Nectarios the first bishop of Madagascar. Madagascar became the independent eparchia, before that it was part of Zimbabwean metropolia. The Eastern Orthodox mission guides several villages and settlements, some of them are fully converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. One of them is the village Ambovandramanesi. It is one of the first villages visited by Father Nectarios. It has one of the strongest Eastern Orthodox communities. This is confirmed by a case which happened here. Once there came to the village two American Baptist missionaries. They sermonized for three days. Finally they promised to build a church, a school, and a hospital if everyone were converted. But the elder of the village speaking for all of the locals answered them: \\"We could demand your departure at the very first day, but we listened to what you wanted to say. Now, when you have finished your sermon, we ask you to leave our village and never come back. We don't need your churches, schools and hospitals as we are Orthodox Christians\\". The locals were not christened at the time and had not given a promise to build something. Later a medical ambulatory clinic was built on a plot of land gifted by Greek Consul. Here also the hierarch Nectarios planned to build a temple, a seminary, a woman cloister, and an eye clinic. Bishop Nectarios also ordained the first Malagasy nun named Christodula. Eastern Orthodoxy is most frequently accepted by poorer people. In the villages and settlements people live in huts made of palm leaves; chapels and temples are usually of the same material. Local priests serve in these temples and chapels straggled in rural areas. In the missions there is a lot of work, and lack of workers. Eastern Orthodox missions are the poorest in terms of the resources, but they try to participate in aid programs. Father Nectarios died in a helicopter crash together with Patriarch Peter VII and 15 other people on 11 September 2004. They were heading to the Holy Mount Athos on board a Greek Army helicopter.

Phyo attended Ewha and Yonsei Universities and studied international business, graduating in 1987 and 1989, respectively. She then graduated from Cornell University with a dual bachelor's in human ecology design and business management, and a minor in nutritional sciences in 1990.

As customer requests increased for packed and prepared foods, the SmartMonkey Foods line of packed dressings, sauces, cheeses, pizza crust, desserts was launched. The company moved to Portland, OR for 4 years 2003‚Äì2006, where SmartMonkey Foods provided catering, packaged prepared foods, classes, retreats, weekly cafes, monthly special events, and their fruit and nut bars called SmartMonkey Bars. Clients included Nike, Adidas, Portland Institute of Contemporary Art, and Carnival Cruise Lines, to name a few. Phyo sold SmartMonkey Foods, which ceased operations in 2009.Smart Monkey announcement Phyo moved to San Francisco and founded a multimedia company called SmartMonkey Media, which produced live multimedia events, including the world's first online fashion show, \\"Fiber,\\" in 1994 Netcast over copper lines before ISDN or T1 lines were available to the U.C. Berkeley multicast backbone (known as MBone), this show was attended by a global audience via the internet, and has changed our marketing landscape. As an early pioneer of the web, Phyo was a part of San Francisco digital lab, Cyberlab 7, and founder of Dimension 7, where she handled CG work on Virtuosity, the early cyber film starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe and produced by Paramount Pictures. A partial client list includes Warner Bros. (Porno For Pyros tour, Perry Farrell), Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, Microsoft, Pacific Bell, and Ninja Tunes UK. Phyo's produced numerous websites, including a 14,000 page rich-media educational site for Simon & Schuster in 1996. One ground breaking project sent video jockeys across the Mediterranean on bicycles with laptops and video cameras. The VJs would post their journals online, shoot video and overnight it to Ani, who would edit them and put them onto the website. The VJs would chat online from a different classroom weekly during their journey, and this occurred more than 10 years prior to YouTube and Facebook. Her book Return on Design was an early educational book on user-centered interaction design for the Web and wireless technologies which came out of the design and media classes she taught at U.C. Berkeley, San Francisco State University, and San Jose State University. Phyo owned a web design studio that sold in 1999. Phyo has been a consultant for the Disney Channel (convergence TV and web), ABC Family, Gymboree, Electronic Arts, and Apple Inc., among others. She lives in Los Angeles, California with her Rhodesian Ridgeback, Kanga.

Life Catherine was the last child of market gardenerWilliam Blake, Osbert Burdett, 1926, Parkstone Press International (reprint), p. 37 William Boucher (1714-1794) and Mary Davis (1716-1782). A \\"demure young woman\\", in response to her mother's queries regarding which of her acquaintances she would take for a husband, she would reply that she had not yet met such a man.William Blake, Osbert Burdett, 1926, Parkstone Press International (reprint), p. 37 She met William Blake in Battersea in 1781, during his brief visit to the area, while he was recovering from an emotional upset following the failure of an earlier relationship. Their courtship was brief. According to early biographers of Blake, Catherine immediately recognised him as her future husband and when she sympathised with him over his earlier emotional troubles he replied \\"do you pity me? Then I love you.\\"Thomas Wright, Life of William Blake, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 9. Blake married Catherine - who was five years his junior - on 18 August 1782 in St. Mary's Church, Battersea. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an 'X' \\"like many brides of her day\\", there being \\"no national schools... and even regular Sunday schools had not been invented\\".William Blake, Osbert Burdett, 1926, Parkstone Press International (reprint), p. 37\\"Catherine Blake, ca.1805\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 5 November 2008. They remained together until his death in 1827.Myrone, 155 Blake taught her to read and write, and also to use his printing-press. She was considered to be the foundation of Blake's \\"invariable type of woman\\" as depicted in his art, \\"tall, slender, and with unusually long legs\\".William Blake, Osbert Burdett, 1926, Parkstone Press International (reprint), p. 37 The couple did not have children, and it has been suggested that Blake wanted to bring a concubine into the relationship to act as a surrogate mother, which was consistent with the theories of Swedenborgianism by which Blake was influenced.Robert Rix, William Blake and the Cultures of Radical Christianity, Ashgate, 2007, p. 193. Blake's earliest biographer Alexander Gilchrist does not mention this, but speaks of unspecified troubles in the early years of the relationship. However, Algernon Charles Swinburne later explicitly asserted that this was the case, but that Blake dropped the idea when he saw that it upset Catherine. No documentary evidence survives supporting this notion, but Blake is known to have stated that he \\"learned from the Bible that wives should be held in common.\\" George Richmond after Tatham's life sketch of Catherine Blake Writers who knew the couple in their later years describe a very happy relationship. In 1802, William Hayley wrote that William \\"and his excellent wife (a true helpmate!) pass the plates thro' a rolling press in their own cottage together\\". On his deathbed, Blake drew a picture of Catherine as his last work, stating \\"you have ever been an angel to me\\". After her husband's death Catherine was taken in by Blake's admirer Frederick Tatham, for whom she nominally worked as a housekeeper. At this period she continued to sell Blake's works. When she died four years later Tatham claimed that she had bequeathed all Blake's works to him. When he later converted to Irvingite beliefs, he destroyed a number of them, asserting that they were inspired by the devil. Catherine and William are buried at Bunhill Cemetery in London. Peter Ackroyd, William Blake, pp. 368‚Äì9. Role in Blake's art Throughout her husband's uneven career, Catherine not only took an active role in the production of William's engravings and illuminated books; she also ran the household finances and offered strong practical support. William's friend J. T. Smith said that Blake \\"allowed her, to the last moment of his practice, to take off his proof impressions and print his works, which she did most carefully.\\" Catherine's role in colouring at least some of William's illuminated books has been wide, although her hand is usually attributed to some of the more clumsily rendered passages. Her work as a printer is held in higher regard. Role in literature It has often been suggested that the figure of Enitharmon in Blake's mythology is partly inspired by Catherine.Sheila A. Spector, Glorious Incomprehensible: The Development of Blake's Kabbalistic Language, Bucknell University Press, 2001, p. 24. Enitharmon is the wife of the \\"eternal prophet\\" Los in Blake's writings. Catherine is explicitly identified as the poet's \\"shadow of delight\\" in the second part of Blake's Milton. Catherine appears as a model wife in William Hayley's writings on ideal marriages. In more recent literature, she is the central character in Janet Adele Warner's novel Other Sorrows, Other Joys: The Marriage of Catherine Sophia Boucher and William Blake (2001) and also features in Tracy Chevalier's novel Burning Bright (2007). She is an amateur detective in short stories by Keith Heller. Jack Shepherd's stage play In Lambeth dramatised a visit by Thomas Paine to the Lambeth home of William and Catherine Blake in 1789. It was first performed at the East Dulwich Tavern in July 1989. The play was later adapted for television in the BBC Two Encounters series (which featured similar fictionalised meetings between historical figures) and was first broadcast on 4 July 1993. It was directed by Sebastian Graham-Jones, and featured Mark Rylance as William, Bob Peck as Paine and Lesley Clare O'Neill as Catherine. Notes References * Myrone, Martin. The Blake Book.

It saw a number of motorists and their own or sponsored automobiles race against the Le Train Bleu, a train that ran between Calais and the French Riviera. The rationale to beat the train was to compare the contemporary automotive performance with locomotive dominance; to showcase recent progress achieved by cars regarding reliability, durability, speed and comfort; to promote the cars, their marques and the adventurous persona of their drivers; and to establish automobiles as a viable and aspirational mode of transport for the individual traveller.  The Blue Train  Le Train Bleu (lit. \\"the blue train\\"), officially the Calais-M√©diterran√©e Express, was a luxury French night express train which carried wealthy and famous passengers between Calais and the French Riviera from 1922 until 1938. It was colloquially referred to as \\"le train bleu\\" in French and the Blue Train in English because of its dark blue sleeping cars, and became formally known as Le Train Bleu after World War II. It was created by a private French railroad company, the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e, or PLM, to take British aristocrats, celebrities and the wealthy to the French Riviera. It made its first journey on December 8, 1922. The prime season for \\"le train bleu\\" was between November and April, when wealthy travellers escaped the British winter to spend their holiday on the French Riviera. It originated at the Gare Maritime in Calais, where it picked up British passengers from the ferries across the English Channel. It departed at 1:00 in the afternoon and went to the Gare du Nord in Paris, then around Paris by the Grande Ceinture line to the Gare de Lyon, where it picked up additional passengers and coaches. It departed Paris early in the evening, and made stops at Dijon, Chalon, and Lyon, before reaching Marseille early in the morning. It then made stops at all the major resort towns of the French Riviera, or C√¥te d'Azur: St. Raphael, Juan-les-Pins, Antibes, Cannes, Nice, Monaco, and its final destination, Menton, near the Italian border.  Rover Light Six  1929 Rover Light Six \\"Blue Train\\" In January 1930, the Rover name was publicised by a race between a Rover and \\"Le train bleu\\" on the train's run between Calais and Cannes. The idea of racing the Blue Train was popular with motor enthusiasts, and each new attempt was received with varying expectations of success. Many had already failed this challenge. Former motorcycle tester and pioneer publicist Dudley Noble had the idea to promote the new Rover Light Six by racing it against the Blue Train across France from St. Raphael on the C√¥te d'Azur to Calais. Noble knew that the average speed of the Blue Train, once all its stops and detours were taken into account, was no more than about . To beat the train, Noble had to drive more or less non-stop from St. Raphael to Calais. The Rover Light Six averaged on its journey to beat the train's expected time of just over 20 hours, which gave the Rover team a 20-minute lead over the train. The Blue Train had been beaten for the first time and the Rover team became celebrities through the Daily Express.References: *Robson, Graham, The Rover Story, [ p. 28] *Brady, Chris and Lorenz, Andrew, End of the Road: The Real Story of the Downfall of Rover *Lewis, Robert, Five Million Rovers (And More), Car Keys *British Motor Heritage Centre, Rover Report on their first 70 years *Pickard, J., Reserved and Refined British Saloon Cars: Official History of Rover and Timeline Milestones, Rover 1904-2004  Alvis Silver Eagle  In early March 1930, E.J.P.

Bentley Speed Six  Woolf Barnato's Speed Six H. J. Mulliner saloon, in which he raced against the Blue Train. In March 1930, at a dinner at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes, talk around the table had swung round to the topic of motor cars; in particular to the advertisement by Rover claiming that its Light Six had gone faster than the famous \\"Le train bleu\\" express. Woolf Barnato, chairman of Bentley and winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1928 and 1929,Barnato would win at Le Mans again the following June. contended that just to go faster than the Blue Train was of no special merit. He raised the stakes by arguing that at the wheel of his Bentley Speed Six, he could be at his club in London before the train reached Calais and bet ¬£100 on that challenge.Burgess-Wise, David, \\"The Slippery Shape of Power\\" Auto Aficionado The next day, 13 March 1930, as the Blue Train steamed out of Cannes station at 17:45h,\\"Special Edition: Bentley Arnage Blue Train\\", The Car Experience Barnato and his relief driver, amateur golfer Dale Bourn, finished their drinks and drove the Bentley away from the bar at the Carlton. From Lyon onwards they had to battle against heavy rain. At 4:20h, in Auxerre, they lost time searching for a refueling rendezvous. Through central France they hit fog, then shortly after Paris they had a burst tyre, requiring the use of their only spare.Young, Eoin, Barnato, Bentley and the Blue Train Mystery, New Zealand Classic Car Magazine, Issue 190 They reached the dock at Boulogne at 10:30h, sailed to England on the cross-Channel packet, and were parking outside The Conservative Club in St. James's Street, London, at 15:20h, four minutes before the Blue Train reached Calais, thus winning the bet. The French authorities promptly fined him a sum far greater than his winnings for racing on public roads, and Bentley was excluded from the 1930 Paris Salon for advertising an unauthorized race. = The Blue Train Bentley controversy = Gurney Nutting Sportsman Coup√©, often believed to be the car that raced the Blue Train despite being delivered to Barnato weeks after the race. Barnato drove an H. J. Mulliner-bodied Bentley Speed Six formal saloon during the race,Brodeur, Nicole, \\"Bentley mystery is revealed\\", The Seattle Times, September 7, 2007Melissen, Wouter, \\"Bentley Speed Six 'Blue Train Special'\\", UltimateCarPage which became known as the Blue Train Bentley. Two months later, on 21 May 1930, he took delivery of a new Bentley Speed Six streamlined fastback \\"Sportsman Coupe\\" by Gurney Nutting. Barnato named it the \\"Blue Train Special\\" in memory of his race, and it too became commonly referred to as the Blue Train Bentley. The H. J. Mulliner-bodywork was stripped off the original car's chassis to make place for a bespoke replacement, as was common practice for automobiles at that time. As time passed, the Gurney Nutting-bodied car was regularly mistaken for or erroneously referred to as being the car that had raced the Blue Train. This was reiterated in articles and in Terence Cuneo's painting of the race, which shows the Gurney Nutting coup√© just ahead of the train. In 2005 Bentley featured the coup√© in the company's promotional material celebrating the race's 75th anniversary. Careful reading of Barnato's account of the race, published in the 1946 British Racing Drivers' Club review, show that Barnato referred to \\"my Speed Six saloon,\\" keeping petrol cans in the boot, and having only one spare tyre, while the Sportsman Coupƒó had no boot and two spare tyres, one on either side of the bonnet. Research efforts by Bruce and Jolene McCaw of Medina, Washington, who bought the Gurney Nutting-built \\"Blue Train Special\\", have further exposed and widely publicised the mistake. The original H. J. Mulliner Blue Train Bentley bodywork was also reconstructed, and both cars have been fully restored. They are both currently owned by the McCaws.

The species is known for its bright and vivid coloration. Native to tropical forests in Western Africa, the fire skink lives fifteen to twenty years. This species is a diurnal lizard that loves to burrow and hide. It is relatively shy and reclusive, but may become tame in captivity. Etymology The specific name, fernandi, refers to the island formerly known as Fernando Po,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Lygosoma fernandi, p. 89). which has been called Bioko since 1979. It is known in the Yoruba language, spoken in Western Africa, as ·ªål·ªçy·ªçmb·∫πÃÅr·∫πÃÅ. Taxonomy Historically, the fire skink has been placed in several different genera and was until recently placed in Riopa together with several skinks from southeast Asia. While these are superficially similar to the African fire skink, they are closer to some other Asian skinks, resulting in their move to Mochlus. The fire skink is not closely related to other skinks and belongs to the genus Mochlus.Wagner P, B√∂hme W, Pauwels OSG, Schmitz A (2009). \\"A review of the African red‚Äìflanked skinks of the Lygosoma fernandi (BURTON, 1836) species group (Squamata: Scincidae) and the role of climate change in their speciation\\". Zootaxa 2050: 1-30. However, a review of the taxonomy of the fire skink did reveal that it, as traditionally defined, actually consists of three separate species. This essentially limits true M. fernandi to tropical Western Africa, while population in Central and East Africa are M. hinkeli and M. striatus. Description The fire skink is a fairly large species of skink, reaching up to in total length (including tail).Reptile Database (5 February 2013). Lepidothyris fernandi. The most notable aspect of the fire skink's appearance is its vivid, bright colors. Smooth, gold scales adorn the fire skink's back, while red and black bars set against a silver background line its sides. The fire skink does not display obvious sexual dimorphism, which makes it difficult to sex. Males are, in general, bulkier than females with a slightly flatter head and wider jaws. Reproduction The fire skink, unlike many other skink species, is oviparous. An adult female will generally lay a clutch of five to nine eggs after mating. Fire skink eggs take forty to fifty days to hatch when incubated at a temperature of . Diet M. fernandi has a large appetite, and it is mainly insectivorous. Insects such as crickets, and larvae such as mealworms, are used for feeding captive specimens.The African fire skink. Reptiles Magazine. In captivity The fire skink is kept as a pet. Many specimens available for sale are wild-caught, but captive-bred skinks are available. The fire skink requires a larger tank with plenty of horizontal space, as well as some vertical space for its occasional tendency to climb. A 40 gallon aquarium is suitable for one adult. Fire Skinks are not social and should be kept alone. It also requires a loose substrate for burrowing. The environment should be moist and humid, with plenty of ground cover to create hiding places. One end of the tank should be warmed with a lamp for basking. Live insects are a proper diet, and some keepers provide an occasional pinkie mouse.

A tropical depression formed on October 8, and became Tropical Storm Odile 18 hours later. The storm paralleled the south coast of Mexico, with the center located only several miles offshore. After peaking in intensity, increasing southeasterly vertical wind shear induced a trend of rapid weakening on the storm. Correspondingly, Odile was downgraded to a tropical depression early on 12 October, subsequently degenerating into a remnant low about 55 mi (85 km) south of Manzanillo, Colima. From thereon, the low proceeded slowly south- southwestward before dissipating on October 13. Since Odile stayed at sea, its effects along coastlines were limited. The most notable damages were caused by flooding along the southern coast of Mexico, mostly in Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoac√°n. The exact amount of damage, however, remains unknown, and no fatalities were reported as a result of the storm. Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on September 23, and merged with the southern end of a decaying frontal system over the Caribbean Sea. The combined disturbance gradually split, with the northernmost section eventually becoming Tropical Storm Marco. The southernmost end moved into the eastern Pacific, which then immediately showed signs of organization. The system stalled just south of El Salvador throughout October 5, where it came under the influence of strong vertical wind shear. The circulation slowly drifted east-northeastward and became absorbed by a neighboring tropical wave, with the broad resultant low re-curving to the west-northwest. In response to relaxing shear aloft, convection redeveloped around the newly formed center of circulation. It subsequently acquired a sufficiently organized structure and post-analysis found that a tropical depression formed at around 1200 UTC on October 8. Upon developing, the depression was designated as Sixteen-E about 120 mi (195 km) south-southwest of San Salvador, El Salvador, and operationally, advisories were initiated at 2100 UTC ‚Äî 9 hours after post- analytic estimates of formation. Despite being in an area with favorable conditions, lack of inner core organization proved difficult for rapid deepening to occur, and initially, model guidance did not forecast any significant strengthening. Contrary to expectations, satellite imagery showed a gradual increase in organization later that evening. Bands of convection deepened in the southern quadrant, indicating that the storm was steadily strengthening. Located just to the south of a large mid-level ridge over Mexico, the system was steered toward the west-northwest, proceeding within a favorable environment. Based on the improved appearance on satellite imagery, it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Odile at 0600 UTC on October 9 about 330 mi (530 km) southeast of Puerto √Ångel, Mexico. Shortly after attaining tropical storm status, Odile began to develop a small area of central dense overcast, and upper-level cirrus outflow became well- defined within the western semicircle of the storm. Convective banding organized to the south and southwest of the circulation, leading Dvorak T-numbers to estimate an intensity of at least . Based on this estimate, the NHC noted a high chance of further intensification into a minimal hurricane. Odile maintained its intensity, as upper-level outflow of the circulation was reduced to the northeast. Although wind shear initially dislocated the circulation from the main convection, a large burst of convection allowed Odile to intensify slightly further to peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) at around 0600 UTC on October 10. Tropical Storm Odile at peak intensity on October 10 Odile closely paralleled the Mexican coastline. The intensification did not last long, in fact, the convection associated with Odile diminished in the afternoon and its rainbands became rather distorted. Another cluster of convection sprung up that evening, this time with cloud tops colder than . The circulation center was well embedded within the convection. As a consequence of the slightly improved organization, Odile had a stronger interaction with the easterlies aloft, therefore increasing forward movement speed. Later that day, a reconnaissance aircraft passed through Odile and observed a rather weak and disorganized tropical cyclone, resulting in meteorologists at the NHC to change its forecasts. Early on October 12, Odile made its closest approach to coastline of Mexico, only about 50 mi (80 km) offshore of Guerrero, Mexico. Increasing southeasterly vertical wind shear took toll on the system. Furthermore, around 0600 UTC, NHC confirmed that Odile weakened into a tropical depression. The last advisory regarding Odile was issued later that day stating that it has subsequently degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area, a swirl of low-level clouds. The remnants of Odile meandered slowly south-southwestward before completely dissipating on October 13. Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Odile shortly before losing its intensity Throughout Odile's existence, the National Weather Service of Mexico declared several tropical storm watches and warnings for the Pacific coast of Mexico spanning from Jalisco to Oaxaca. They were extended and discontinued as Odile progressed westward. On October 11 at around 2 AM PDT, a hurricane watch was declared for the Pacific coast of Mexico from Tecp√°n de Galeana to Punta San Telmo. Six hours later, the hurricane watch was adjusted and in effect for the coast from Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. They were all discontinued later that day as the chance of Odile becoming a hurricane diminished. On October 8, blue alerts were declared for 118 municipalities in Chiapas following the minimal threat of tropical storm-force impact. The civil defense system in the state of Chiapas warned that the storm could leave up to of rainfall. Shippings were closed in the Port of Chiapas, leaving over 3,000 boats stranded ashore on October 9. Flooding in Acapulco forced officials to close schools on October 10. Meanwhile, the state government reported that 232 police were ready to provide assistance to citizens in advance of Odile. Civil defense officials in the state of Guerrero ordered about 10,000 people to evacuate their homes. On October 11, a yellow alert were declared for the state of Michoac√°n, where the civil defense committee also announced that the shelters were opened for schools in the municipality of L√°zaro C√°rdenas and the towns of Playa Azul and Guacamayas. Ports in L√°zaro C√°rdenas were also closed later that day. On October 10, about of rainfall were accumulated in the city of Acapulco. The torrential rainfall caused flooding which damaged more than 100 houses, with two of them completely destroyed. Excess floodwater collapsed walls and covered roads with mud that reached as much as . Nearly 150 homes were inundated with of water. The flooding is also responsible for causing strong current that had swept away parked vehicles, downing of at least 16 trees and carrying debris to the main streets of the port. Odile also managed to cause damage toward the plumbing and sewage supplies of Acapulco, resulting no clean water access in about fifty communities of the suburban areas of Acapulco for several days. The water levels of Papagayo River reached its maximum capacity, damaging electrical supplies. In Michoac√°n, strong winds resulted 30 downed trees and the collapse of 5 power poles, leaving 10 minutes without electricity for a large part of the city.

The Major League Baseball logo was designed by Jerry Dior in 1968 and was included on all on-field uniforms of Major League Baseball (MLB) employees beginning in the 1969 season. Creation According to Dior, the logo was created in a single afternoon. Contrary to popular belief, the silhouette was not modeled on Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew, or any specific player but was drawn with reference to photographs of several players. The silhouette was chosen specifically because of its ambiguity: the batter could be right- or left-handed and of any ethnic background. The MLB \\"Batter\\" logo was commissioned by the Major League Baseball Centennial Committee, and was introduced by the new Baseball Commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, to be used in preparations for, and celebration of, the 1869 - 1969 Professional Baseball Centennial Celebration held July 21, 1969 in Washington, DC. Controversy For many years, the authorship of the logo was a matter of some dispute as two graphic designers laid claim to creating the piece: Jerry Dior (working for the marketing firm of Sandgren & Murtha) and James Sherman, who is probably better known publicly as a comic book illustrator. In November 2008, ESPN writer Paul Lukas managed to clear the matter up and Dior's authorship is no longer in doubt. Upon closely examining the logo, Sherman declared: > \\"That's not my logo, and I was totally unaware that it existed... The logo I > created was very similar, but I designed it in the early 1980s. All I can > say is that I was so sports-unaware that I didn't know about the earlier > logo. I feel like a total idiot now that I didn't know about it. I'm > flabbergasted.\\" Popularity and influence The logo has not been changed in the years since its adoption, except for small variations in the shades of blue and red, and that individual teams sometimes alter the coloring to match their uniform colors. Since its adoption, the basic model of an athlete (or equipment used for the sport) in silhouette flanked by red and blue color blocks has also been incorporated in the logos of the National Basketball Association (with Jerry West as its player model), Minor League Baseball, Women's National Basketball Association, Arena Football League, U.S. Figure Skating, Hockey Canada, American Hockey League, PGA Tour, National Lacrosse League, Indy Racing League, and Major League Gaming. It has also been parodied in Major League Eating. Alan Siegel, who oversaw Dior's logo, deliberately based his NBA logo design off the MLB's in 1969 because NBA Commissioner J. Walter Kennedy wanted a family relationship between the sports seen as being All- American.

Bidders submit bids that report their valuations for the items, without knowing the bids of the other bidders. The auction system assigns the items in a socially optimal manner: it charges each individual the harm they cause to other bidders. It gives bidders an incentive to bid their true valuations, by ensuring that the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuations of the items. It is a generalization of a Vickrey auction for multiple items. The auction is named after William Vickrey, Edward H. Clarke, and Theodore Groves for their papers that successively generalized the idea. The VCG auction is a specific use of the more general VCG Mechanism. While the VCG auction tries to make a socially optimal allocation of items, VCG mechanisms allow for the selection of a socially optimal outcome out of a set of possible outcomes. If collusion is likely to occur among bidders, the VCG outperforms the generalized second-price auction for both revenues produced for the seller and allocative efficiency.  Intuitive description Consider an auction where a set of identical products are being sold. Bidders can take part in the auction by announcing the maximum price they are willing to pay to receive N products. Each buyer is allowed to declare more than one bid, since its willingness-to-pay per unit might be different depending on the total number of units it receives. Bidders cannot see other people's bids at any moment since they are sealed (only visible to the auction system). Once all the bids are made, the auction is closed. All the possible combinations of bids are then considered by the auction system, and the one maximizing the total sum of bids is kept, with the condition that it does not exceed the total amount of products available and that at most one bid from each bidder can be used. Bidders who have made a successful bid then receive the product quantity specified in their bid. The price they pay in exchange, however, is not the amount they had bid initially but only the marginal harm their bid has caused to other bidders (which is at most as high as their original bid). This marginal harm caused to other participants (i.e. the final price paid by each individual with a successful bid) can be calculated as: (sum of bids of the auction from the best combination of bids excluding the participant under consideration) - (what other winning bidders have bid in the current (best) combination of bids). If the sum of bids of the second best combination of bids is the same as that of the best combination, then the price paid by the buyers will be the same as their initial bid. In all other cases, the price paid by the buyers will be lower. At the end of the auction, the total utility has been maximized since all the goods have been attributed to the people with the highest combined willingness-to-pay. If agents are fully rational and in the absence of collusion, we can assume that the willingness to pay have been reported truthfully since only the marginal harm to other bidders will be charged to each participant, making truthful reporting a weakly-dominant strategy. This type of auction, however, will not maximize the seller's revenue unless the sum of bids of the second best combination of bids is equal to the sum of bids of the best combination of bids.  Formal description ; Notation For any set of auctioned items M = {t_1,\\\\ldots,t_m} and any set of bidders N = {b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n}, let V^M_N be the social value of the VCG auction for a given bid-combination. That is, how much each person values the items they've just won, added up across everyone. The value of the item is zero if they do not win. For a bidder b_i and item t_j, let the bidder's bid for the item be v_{i}(t_{j}). The notation A \\\\setminus B means the set of elements of A which are not elements of B. ; Assignment A bidder b_i whose bid for an item t_j is an \\"overbid\\", namely v_{i}(t_{j}), wins the item, but pays V^{M}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}-V^{M \\\\setminus {t_j}}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}, which is the social cost of their winning that is incurred by the rest of the agents. ; Explanation Indeed, the set of bidders other than b_i is N \\\\setminus {b_i}. When item t_j is available, they could attain welfare V^{M}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}. The winning of the item by b_i reduces the set of available items to M \\\\setminus {t_j}, however, so that the attainable welfare is now V^{M \\\\setminus {t_j}}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}. The difference between the two levels of welfare is therefore the loss in attainable welfare suffered by the rest of the bidders, as predicted, given the winner b_i got the item t_j. This quantity depends on the offers of the rest of the agents and is unknown to agent b_i. ; Winner's utility The winning bidder whose bid is the true value A for the item t_j, v_{i}(t_{j})=A, derives maximum utility A - \\\\left(V^{M}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}-V^{M \\\\setminus {t_j}}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}\\\\right). Examples =Two items, three bidders= Suppose two apples are being auctioned among three bidders. * Bidder A wants one apple and is willing to pay $5 for that apple. * Bidder B wants one apple and is willing to pay $2 for it. * Bidder C wants two apples and is willing to pay $6 to have both of them but is uninterested in buying only one without the other. First, the outcome of the auction is determined by maximizing bids: the apples go to bidder A and bidder B, since their combined bid of $5 + $2 = $7 is greater than the bid for two apples by bidder C who is willing to pay only $6. Thus, after the auction, the value achieved by bidder A is $5, by bidder B is $2, and by bidder C is $0 (since bidder C gets nothing). Note that the determination of winners is essentially a knapsack problem. Next, the formula for deciding payments gives: * For bidder A: The payment for winning required of A is determined as follows: First, in an auction that excludes bidder A, the social-welfare maximizing outcome would assign both apples to bidder C for a total social value of $6. Next, the total social value of the original auction excluding A's value is computed as $7 - $5 = $2. Finally, subtract the second value from the first value. Thus, the payment required of A is $6 ‚àí $2 = $4. * For bidder B: Similar to the above, the best outcome for an auction that excludes bidder B assigns both apples to bidder C for $6. The total social value of the original auction minus B's portion is $5. Thus, the payment required of B is $6 ‚àí $5 = $1. * Finally, the payment for bidder C is (($5 + $2) ‚àí ($5 + $2)) = $0. After the auction, A is $1 better off than before (paying $4 to gain $5 of utility), B is $1 better off than before (paying $1 to gain $2 of utility), and C is neutral (having not won anything). =Two bidders= Assume that there are two bidders, b_1 and b_2, two items, t_1 and t_2, and each bidder is allowed to obtain one item. We let v_{i,j} be bidder b_i's valuation for item t_j. Assume v_{1,1} = 10, v_{1,2} = 5, v_{2,1} = 5, and v_{2,2} = 3. We see that both b_1 and b_2 would prefer to receive item t_1; however, the socially optimal assignment gives item t_1 to bidder b_1 (so their achieved value is 10) and item t_2 to bidder b_2 (so their achieved value is 3). Hence, the total achieved value is 13, which is optimal. If person b_2 were not in the auction, person b_1 would still be assigned to t_1, and hence person b_1 can gain nothing more. The current outcome is 10; hence b_2 is charged 10-10=0. If person b_1 were not in the auction, t_1 would be assigned to b_2, and would have valuation 5. The current outcome is 3; hence b_1 is charged 5-3=2. =Example #3= A multiple item auction with n bidders, n houses, and values \\\\tilde v_{ij}, representing the value player i has for house j. Possible outcomes are characterized by bipartite matchings, pairing houses with people. If we know the values, then maximizing social welfare reduces to computing a maximum weight bipartite matching. If we do not know the values, then we instead solicit bids \\\\tilde b_{ij}, asking each player i how much they would wish to bid for house j. Define b_i(a) = \\\\tilde b_{ik} if bidder i receives house k in the matching a. Now compute a^*, a maximum weight bipartite matching with respect to the bids, and compute : p_i = \\\\left[ \\\\max_{a \\\\in A} \\\\sum_{j eq i} b_j(a) \\\\right] - \\\\sum_{j eq i} b_j(a^*) . The first term is another max weight bipartite matching, and the second term can be computed easily from a^*. Optimality of truthful bidding The following is a proof that bidding one's true valuations for the auctioned items is optimal.https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~arielpro/15896/docs/notes14.pdf For each bidder b_i, let v_i be their true valuation of an item t_i, and suppose (without loss of generality) that b_i wins t_i upon submitting their true valuations. Then the net utility U_i attained by b_i is given by their own valuation of the item they've won, minus the price they've paid: : \\\\begin{align} U_i &= v_i-\\\\left(V^{M}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}-V^{M \\\\setminus {t_i}}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}\\\\right) \\\\ &=\\\\sum_{j}v_j-\\\\sum_{j eq i}v_j+V^{M\\\\setminus {t_i}}_{N\\\\setminus {b_i}}-V^M_{N\\\\setminus{b_i}} \\\\ &=\\\\sum_j v_j-V^{M\\\\setminus {t_i}}_{N\\\\setminus {b_i}}+V^{M\\\\setminus {t_i}}_{N\\\\setminus {b_i}}-V^M_{N\\\\setminus{b_i}} \\\\ &=\\\\sum_j v_j-V^M_{N\\\\setminus{b_i}.} \\\\end{align} As V^M_{N\\\\setminus{b_i}} is independent of v_i, the maximization of net utility is pursued by the mechanism along with the maximization of corporate gross utility \\\\sum_j v_j for the declared bid v_i. To make it clearer, let us form the difference U_i - U_j = \\\\left[v_i + V^{M \\\\setminus {t_i}}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}\\\\right] - \\\\left[v_j + V^{M \\\\setminus {t_j}}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}\\\\right] between net utility U_i of b_i under truthful bidding v_i gotten item t_i, and net utility U_j of bidder b_i under non-truthful bidding v'_i for item t_i gotten item t_j on true utility v_j. \\\\left[v_j + V^{M \\\\setminus {t_j}}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}\\\\right] is the corporate gross utility obtained with the non-truthful bidding. But the allocation assigning t_j to b_i is different from the allocation assigning t_i to b_i which gets maximum (true) gross corporate utility. Hence \\\\left[v_i + V^{M \\\\setminus {t_i}}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}\\\\right] - \\\\left[v_j + V^{M \\\\setminus {t_j}}_{N \\\\setminus {b_i}}\\\\right]\\\\geq 0 and U_i\\\\geq U_j q.e.d.

They are best described as \\"off tone\\" wavy lines/streaks or patterns in the molded part around the injection ports. They commonly occur when there is a large variation between cooling speeds of sections of the material as it flows through the mold. Prevention Methods Flow mark causes vary for specific parts and production lines due to the variability in molds, machines, and materials. For the most part they are due to varying cooling speeds of the material as it flows through the mold. The different prevention methods for varying cooling speeds are as follows: = Injection Speed/Pressure = Insufficient Injection speed and pressure can cause the injected material to cool and become stiffer during the injection process which can lead to a dull finish on the surface of the part. Increasing the speed will allow the material shot to fill the mold before it cools. = Material/Mold Temperature = A low temperature will have a similar effect as a slow injection speed due to both causing the material to stiffen before the cycle completes. Increasing the temperature of the material or mold allows the material to flow without stiffening before the cycle completes. If the temperature is increased too high, there is a chance to cause a different type of injection molding defect referred to as a burn mark. = Mold Design = The design of a mold is one of the most important factors in correcting defects due to it controlling most of the process. For flow marks specifically, some causes that can be addressed are varying wall thicknesses, mold gate locations, and rough flow paths. Prevention for varying wall thicknesses is to round the corner where the thickness varies. This prevents the flow rate from suddenly decreasing or changing direction. Moving the location of mold gates away from mold coolant allows the material to flow more evenly and prevent premature cooling. Flow paths in the mold should allow the material to flow smoothly through the mold to prevent drastic variation in flow rate.

It is one of the most important and best-preserved prehistoric sites in the Balearic Islands, although it is largely overgrown with woodland, mainly Quercus ilex (holm oak), making it impossible to see the site as a whole. Definition The talaiots, or talayots, are Bronze Age megalithic structures on the islands of Menorca and Majorca. There are at least 274 of them. Dating from the late second millennium and early first millennium BC (between 1,300‚Äì900BC), they are round or square structures built of rough stone, around a central space at the center of which stood a column. This supported a ceiling of stone slabs which also formed the floor of the next story. Their purpose is not clearly understood: religious or tribal ceremonies, storehouses and distribution centres have been suggested. They are not thought to have been used as dwelling places or as defensive buildings. These monuments pre-date the taulas, which are usually found nearby. The Talaiotic Culture began some 3,000 years ago and ended with the arrival of the Romans in the Balearic Islands in 123BC. Development of the settlement The Ses Pa√Øsses settlement is thought to have begun as a cylindrical talaiot, or \\"turriform\\", built during the first millennium BC (c900‚Äì800BC) on a hillside with a commanding view of the surrounding countryside. Originally it would have stood alone, probably as a territorial marker. The tower is 12m in diameter and still stands 4m tall; there are stairs within the massively thick wall, but the building's central column has not survived. Visitors to the site are not allowed to access this building. A low passageway, roughly 0.75m high, runs right through the building from one side to the other, linking the central chamber to a later room known as \\"the hypostyle chamber\\" adjoining it to the northeast. The hypostyle chamber adjoins the central talayot (to the right) which is thought to be the site's oldest structure The hypostyle chamber is so-called because of the three short columns at the centre of the room and the remains of seven others built into the walls. It has two parallel walls, one square end and a rounded or \\"apsidal\\" end. It measures approximately 12m √ó 8m. Next to the hypostyle chamber, to the south, and also attached to the central talaiot, is another apsidal horseshoe-shaped chamber. It has been dated to the post-Talayotic period (500‚Äì123BC). Excavated in 1959 and 1960, it contained several hearths with fragments of bone, talayotic ceramics and charcoal. A burial and iron tools were also found, indicating later use of the site. The \\"cyclopean\\" perimeter walls (built circa 650‚Äì540BC) are more recent than many of the buildings within A series of kidney-shaped chambers clustered around the south side of the original talaiot has been excavated. There are indications of other buildings in an elliptical central area measuring roughly 65m √ó 55m around the talaiot, and others within the massive outer wall of the settlement, also roughly elliptical, which measures some 140m √ó 105m. Built sometime between 650‚Äì540BC, long after the central talaiot and many of its surrounding buildings, this thick wall of cyclopean masonry consists of a base row of huge outer boulders, some weighing around 8 tonnes, with smaller ones (mostly now scattered) above them; it is faced on the inside with rows of smaller rocks. There seem to have been three entrances in this perimeter wall, which is about 350m long. The main gateway through the outer wall is at the southeast and consists of two vertical boulders with a third balanced on them as a lintel. It opens into a passageway 4.3m long with stairs to either side. There is another similarly-sized entrance to the northeast, though its lintel has disappeared. The southwest gateway, which gave access to a nearby spring, also has no lintel, and is less obvious.

The most powerful carburettor engine (with the S works conversion) and the only non-Works Mini fitted with an oil cooler as standard. It was an instant success and sold out even before cars began to appear in showrooms, which prompted Rover to put a Cooper in full-time production. =Mini Cooper Monte Carlo= *Year: 1994 (January and July) *Based on: Mini Cooper 1.3i *Engine: 1,275 cc *Exterior colour: **Flame Red (CPQ - BLVC1000) **Black (PMF - BLVC644) *Exterior trim: *Decals/badges: \\"John Cooper\\" signature decals, coachline with Monte Carlo decals *Interior: Wooden dashboard, red vinyl seats with cream cloth center panels, red seat belts, red carpets, red leather steering wheel, gear knob, and gaiter *Equipment: Gunmetal Minilite-style alloy wheels, four fog lamps *Production: 200 The 1994 Monte Carlo was released to celebrate Paddy Hopkirk's return to the Monte Carlo Rally, 30 years after his original win. =Mini Cooper Grand Prix= *Year: 1994 (August) - December 1996 *Based on: Mini Cooper *Engine: 1,275 cc *Exterior colour: All available Rover Mini Cooper colors *Exterior trim: Chrome grille, handles and locks *Decals/badges: Coachlines with Grand Prix decals *Interior: Leather trim for doors, leather steering wheel and upholstery, glovebox-mounted plaque, walnut 6-gauge dash, door cappings and door pulls *Equipment: Koni adjustable dampers, four driving lamps, stainless sill plates *Modifications: big-valve, ported, balanced and flowed cylinder head, special cam and valve rocker assemblies, Weber Alpha fuel injection (except for the last few, which had a remapped Rover ECU), catalyzed Janspeed exhaust, revised air filter, oil cooler *Production: 35 Only two of the Grand Prix cars were made in a left-hand-drive configuration.

Black leather interior on Japanese red cars. *Equipment: UK cars - Gunmetal grey centred Minilite-style 4.5x12-inch alloy wheels with silver outer rims, two spotlights, two fog lamps. Japanese cars - silver alloys and no fog lamps. *Production: 200 for the UK market (5 of which received John Cooper Garages S specification) 1501 were manufactured for Japan, the first (used in Rover's Japanese launch brochure) remained in the UK. Japanese cars featured air conditioning as standard and fixed rear quarterlights, omitting the two spot lamps and opening rear quarterlights of the UK spec. The exact split between green and red cars for Japan is unknown, red seems to be rarer. The John Cooper S specification Cooper 35 produced 86 hp. The conversion consisted of a replacement cylinder head, 1.5 roller rockers, Janspeed exhaust, K&N; air filter element and modifications to the injection system. An oil cooler was also fitted. These cars had the roof resprayed in Old English White with matching painted on bonnet stripes which run over the scuttle panel as a tribute to the Cooper Car Co racing cars. Badging was updated with red enamelled Cooper inserts on the winged bonnet and boot badges, and the 1.3i badge on the boot lid was replaced by a Si badge. The original side graphics were retained. They also had a unique dashboard and matching door cappings in elm rather than the walnut which featured on the factory car, and three signed ivory auxiliary dials were added, clock, voltmeter and oil pressure, rather than just a clock on the standard car. Alloy door furniture was fitted, signed on some cars, but not all as the door furniture was redesigned around this time. A steering drop bracket was also standard on the Si. The factory steering wheel and gearknob was retained. Externally, in addition to the changes already highlighted, the Si gained clear indicator lenses, and polished metal Cooper wheel centre badges. A number of cars were subsequently converted to S specification by John Cooper Garages, and the S pack cars can be distinguished from the original five cars by a plaque stating conversion number rather than car number. =Mini Cooper Sports LE= *Year: 1998 (May) *Based on: Mini Cooper *Engine: 1,275 cc *Exterior colours: **Brooklands Green (HFB - BLVC1265) **Black (PMF - BLVC644) **Roof: White *Exterior trim: Chrome grille and handles; white mirrors *Decals/badges: Twin coachlines with BMC- style rosette with the words \\"Mini Cooper\\" to the rear; \\"V\\" flash in yellow (similar to British Vita Logo) above the front side indicator; BMC-style rosette with the words \\"Mini Cooper\\" on the right hand side of boot lid; white bonnet stripes *Equipment: Two spotlamps, sports suspension pack, 13x6-inch Sportspack wheels, Sportspack wheelarches *Interior: Walnut dashboard; dark green leather interior; green carpets; dark green leather and black steering wheel; dark green leather gear change boot and knob *Production: 100 (50 of each colour); there is some doubt that the production color split was not even and that more green than black cars were produced.

The village is close to the county border with north Oxfordshire, some 7 miles northwest of Banbury, the closest town. History The remains of a 12th- century motte and bailey castle are just outside the village, which were designated a Scheduled monument in 1961. The Church of England parish church is Decorated Gothic and almost all of it was built in the 14th century. It is one of a few churches in England dedicated to St. Peter ad Vincula. The Battle of Edge Hill, the first battle of the English Civil War, was fought very near the village. The former Church of England school and local Post Office buildings are still standing but have been converted into houses. Upton House is less than from the village. It houses a fine art collection and is managed by the National Trust. In 1922 the Edge Hill Light Railway was built through the village to carry ironstone from a local quarry. It became disused after a few years and was dismantled in 1946.Information about the railway from the Northamptonshire Industrial Archaeology Group Amenities The village has a public house, the Rose & Crown. Parts of the pub are reputed to be 900 years old. It is also a Grade I listed building. The village has a village hall and a sports pitch with football goals and children's play equipment, both of which can be used by the public.

Early life Fitz was born in 1808 in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The family moved to Albany, New York, some eleven years later and to New York City later on. Fitz as a boy was already very interested in science and mechanics. He initially learned the printing trade from his father. They printed the religious weekly publication called \\"The Gospel Herald\\". With his mechanical ability he learned the locksmith trade. One of the many hobbies he enjoyed was astronomy. In the 1830s Fitz was already well known as an amateur astronomer when he was a boy. His first telescope was made using a lens from a pair of eyeglasses when he was fifteen years old. Mid life A refracting telescope of 1848. Fitz knew Alexander Wolcott, who was working on a speculum mirror for a Cassegrain reflector in the early 1830s. Fitz was able to obtain the half- finished blank that Wolcott had done. He then completed the mirror in 1837 to make a telescope. Fitz traveled to Europe from August to November 1839 learning astronomical and photographic optics. He learned the French were the best makers of high quality glass. The English and German opticians taught Fitz the techniques of sawing and grinding glass. By the 1840s Fitz had turned his amateur astronomer hobby into a successful business building telescopes. Fitz pioneered techniques of correcting poor quality glass which made him one of the first important American telescope makers. He was the first American to make very large professional refracting telescopes.The Observatory, 1888: Henry Fitz, of New York, is credited with being the first American who obtained special distinction for the manufacture of refractors; he constructed 30 with object-glasses varying from 6 to in diameter. Fitz made the largest refractor telescopes in America, five different times.Abrahams, 1994: Fitz was the first important American telescope maker because his pioneering techniques of local correction of poor quality glass allowed him to construct the largest American made refractor on five different occasions. Fitz made forty percent of all the telescopes sold in the United States from 1840 to 1855. He also manufactured eighty percent of all astronomical telescopes made in the United States at this time. American made telescopes were significantly less expensive than comparable instruments from Europe. Manufacturing locally in the United States instead of Europe was an important factor in the proliferation of observatories in the nineteenth century in America. Fitz contributed considerably in the development of astronomical photography. Making telescopes and related astronomical components was a labor of love for him. Often he would be found working after midnight. He was the best known American maker of telescopes and achromatic instruments before the Civil War.Lankford, p. 211 Fitz was in partnership with Wolcott and developed a patented Daguerrotype camera. They had a photographic studio in Baltimore in 1841. Fitz invented and built foot power machines for the grinding of lenses. He also had employees do all the other tasks involved and trained them accordingly in the process of making lenes and mirrors. The critical final mirror polishing he did himself, however, and did not allow his employees to do that. Fitz made a six-inch (152 mm) refractor telescope in 1845 for the American Institute Fair for which he received a gold medal. The South Carolina College at Columbia in 1851 bought a telescope form Fitz for $1,200. The telescope was used by the college for the next decade. After the Civil War it was stolen for scrap brass. The Haverford College in Pennsylvania purchased an eight-inch (203 mm) refractor telescope from Fitz in 1852. The West Point Academy purchased from Fitz in 1856 a refractor telescope costing $5,000. Later life and death After his death his wife recalled Fitz making doublet lenses, with the flint element ground from the bottom of a tumbler and the crown element made from plate glass. The original workshop of Fitz‚Äôs is now in storage at the U.S. National Museum of American History. Fitz‚Äôs telescope business was successful, so in 1863 he was in the process of building a new house. Fitz, however, died suddenly at the end of the year. Some have reported that the cause was when a large chandelier fell from the ceiling of his new home. Obituaries report, however, his demise was from tuberculosis. Before his final illness and death, he was about to sail for Europe to select a glass for a telescope, and to procure patents for a camera involving a new form of lens.

He played college football at UC Berkeley and UCLA. High school and college  A high school All-American at Santa Monica High School, Knox played under the tutelage of coach Jim Sutherland.Fan Has Fond Memories of Knox, Los Angeles Times, July 30, 1988, Pg. 3. He played his freshman season for Pappy Waldorf's California Golden Bears before abruptly transferring to UCLA in the fall of 1954. Knox's stepfather, Harvey Knox, was accused of interfering with the Bears' coaching staff and of making extreme monetary demands on the university. The elder Knox had also interfered with his son's high school coaches and Ronnie played for three different high school teams (Beverly Hills, Inglewood, Santa Monica) in three years. Harvey Knox was also accused of interfering in the business of his stepdaughter, actress Patricia Knox. Knox played one season at UCLA in 1955 before being declared ineligible due to accepting \\"under-the-table\\" financing. Professional football After leaving UCLA, Knox signed a movie contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but he would never appear in any pictures for the studio. Knox signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, but would leave the team after one month to once again pursue a film career. Knox signed with the Calgary Stampeders on October 3, 1956, six days after quitting the Tiger-Cats. Selected in the third round of the 1957 NFL Draft, Knox signed with the Chicago Bears. He was suspended indefinitely by head coach (and owner) George Halas in early October 1957 for violations which included his stepfather's public criticism of the team and missing two practices and a quarterback tutoring session without reason. Due to a bitter dispute with the Bears, Knox was not allowed by Halas to play for the Bears or play for any other NFL team. Instead, he signed with the Toronto Argonauts midway through 1958 CFL season with a promise by Harvey Knox to the team that he would not interfere. His most notable performance came on October 25, 1958 when, playing the Ottawa Rough Riders, he passed for 522 yards, then a team record and still second most in Argonaut history. After splitting up with his stepfather, Knox would play only one more season of football before retiring, saying that football was a \\"game for animals.\\" Film actor, a drifter, and a poet After leaving Toronto, Knox appeared in a few movies and television shows, but did not return to football, despite offers from the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers of the newly formed American Football League. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s Knox drifted around California, residing only a short time in various towns, prior to moving again. In July 1988 a reporter located him as he was moving out of a one-room apartment in Canoga Park. Knox had lived there for just several weeks, spending the majority of his time writing poetry. Aside from past residences in McKinleyville, Malibu, and San Francisco, Knox lived for short periods in other states, i.e. Maine and Texas. He also lived for brief stints in Mexico and Europe. Having been single since a divorce from painter Renate Druks in 1964, his philosophy was to stay free. Knox compared his lifestyle to the noble savage written about by James Fennimore Cooper. He read English literature by the hour, stretched out on a cot or in his worn out twelve-year-old car. He yearned for a life at sea.Poetry in Motion, Los Angeles Times, July 17, 1988, Internet article.

It was a boarding school funded by both the Missouri Conference of the Methodist Church and the government of the Chickasaw Nation. Rev.

The Academy closed during the Civil War, and the property was taken over by the Chickasaw Battalion, a Confederate Army unit. After the war, Carr was appointed to a new position by the Methodist Church South, He had married his third wife in 1865, and the couple moved to Texas. The Chickasaw Nation government took control of Bloomfield Academy and reopened it in 1867. A series of superintendents followed. Perhaps the most notable of these was Douglas H. Johnston, who remained in the post from 1880 until 1895. In 1897, Johnston was elected governor of the Chickasaw Nation, a position he held until the Chickasaw government was abolished by Oklahoma Statehood in 1907. Responsibility for the Academy was taken by the Federal Government, and the school continued in its former surroundings until 1914, when most of the buildings were destroyed by a fire. The school moved to Ardmore, Oklahoma. The school was made coeducational and renamed Carter Seminary in 1934. In 2004, Carter Seminary moved to a new location on Lake Texoma, where it operates at present. Pre-Civil War In the fall of 1847, the Missouri Conference appointed Rev, Carr to superintend the construction of Bloomfield Academy in the Choctaw Nation. In 1852, he selected a site and began the construction, even performing some of the manual labor himself. Carr married has second wife, Miss Angelena Hosmer, a native of Massachusetts, in June, 1852. Funding was always tight. One source was an annual contribution of $1000 from a fund that Congress has voted for George Washington, but which the former president had set apart for educational purposes. The Choctaw Nation and later the Chickasaw Nation contributed two-thirds of the annual operating expenses, while the Methodist Board contributed one-third. Expenditures were held down because Rev. Carr, a skilled woodworker, performed all of the carpentry and cabinet work himself. In addition, he also raised corn, wheat and potatoes on the Academy property. He even added two orchards producing peaches, plums and apples. Mrs. Carr was the teacher of handicrafts (\\"fancy work\\") and music. Prior to the Civil War, Bloomfield's curriculum consisted of basic academics, domestic and religious topics. Domestic classes covered sewing, cooking and housework. Religious instruction mainly involved memorizing Christian scriptures, which the missionaries wanted to replace Chickasaw traditions. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Bloomfield and all other boarding schools in Indian Territory closed.Cobb, Amanda J.

Civil War Right after the firing on Fort Sumpter, which opened the US Civil War, the fathers of many of the students enlisted, and their families called their girls home. Bloomfield Academy closed in May 1861. The Carrs continued to live at the site, but Angelina Carr died there in September, 1864. During the war, the facility was used as a free private school. Initially, the Chickasaw Battalion, a Confederate Army unit, planned to occupy it, but there was not enough space for all the soldiers, so the Carr family was allowed to remain. The soldiers camped outdoors and used a small building in the yard for a doctor's office. They also used the sitting room for stores and the school house as a hospital.http://www.okgenweb.org/schools/county/chickasawnat/bloomfield.htm \\"Bloomfield Academy.\\" Retrieved March 18, 2014. Near the end of the war, Rev. Carr learned that his oldest son, Joel Henry, who had been promoted to first lieutenant, had died of a gunshot wound. Post Civil War =Leadership= Rev. Carr married his third wife, Miss S. J. Johnson, in August, 1865. In September 1866, the Indian Mission Annual Conference met at Bloomfield. Carr was appointed Presiding Elder of Choctaw and Chickasaw District. The Carrs left Bloomfield in December 1867. They settled in Paris, Texas. No longer Presiding Elder, he served for a while as a supply (substitute minister) on the local circuit as needed. Family illnesses caused him to leave this work and take a job at a furniture store. Rev. Carr contracted pneumonia and died on December 29, 1876. The Chickasaw government reopened Bloomfield Academy as a coeducational school in the same year. Captain Frederic Young was put in charge for the first year. Dr. and Mrs. H. F. Murray succeeded Captain Young as superintendent for two years. Professor Robert Cole then led the school from 1870 to 1875. Professor J. E. Wharton was superintendent from 1876 to 1880. He was followed by Robert Boyd, who resigned in 1882. In 1876, the Chickasaw legislature provided for the Chickasaw Manual Labor Academy, a school for Chickasaw boys. Bloomfield Academy once again became a school for girls only. Douglas H. Johnston and his wife completed Boyd's term, then received a new 5-year contract. Mrs. Johnston died during this time, and Johnston remarried in 1885. The couple remained at Bloomfield until 1895. Then Johnston was elected governor of the Chickasaw Nation. Johnston popularized education among the Chickasaws. Professor Elihu B. Hinshaw succeeded Johnston and served until 1906. Hinshaw is credited with obtaining a charter from the Chickasaw Legislature that allowed Bloomfield to confer diplomas on students who completed the school's curriculum. J. R. Hendricks served after Hinshaw, and was succeeded by Annie Ream Addington, who remained in charge until 1914, when the main building burned down. Instead of rebuilding, Bloomfield Academy relocated to Ardmore, Oklahoma. =Postwar curriculum= The focus of the curriculum had changed. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, the aim was \\"...to educate students to become leaders, to participate in both Indian and white communities, and to help Chickasaws transcend significant social and economic boundaries.\\" Domestic training was eliminated and religious training was deemphasized. The academic training became more like that of a junior college. The school became known as the \\"Bryn Mawr of the West.\\" Control passed to the United States government after passage of the Curtis Act in 1898. After relocating to Ardmore, Bloomfield resumed operations. In 1934, it was renamed as Carter Seminary. The new name honored Charles D. Carter. In 1949, Carter Seminary became co-educational and boarded Native American children from all over the United States.O'Dell, Larry. \\"Carter County.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Retrieved January 2, 2018. In 2002, plans were made to relocate the Seminary to 160 acres of land on Lake Texoma, near Kingston, Oklahoma creating a Chickasaw Children's Village. The new facility opened in 2004 and continues to operate until the present. Notes References Further reading * Bryce, J. Y.

Quote: \\"the first person mentioned in traditional sources as having devoted himself to philosophy in the Islamic period is Abu'l-Abbas Iranshahri, who flourished in the 3rd/9th century..\\" Life He was born in Nishapur (modern Khorasan in Iran), the city also known as Iranshahr, hence his title Iranshahri. According to Nasir Khusraw, Iranshahri taught Rhazes and Biruni ancient Iranian philosophy. Religious Beliefs According to Al-Biruni his rare impartiality was rooted in his lack of dependence on a particular religion. He created a religion and invited others to that. Works He authored several books and treatises in Arabic and in Persian. All the books written, some of which are mentioned in passing by Biruni and Nasir Khusraw, have been lost. He wrote three books; Jalil, Athir, and Masael u'ttabi'a, about philosophy and wisdom. Abulma'ali states that Iranshahri brought a new religion with a Persian book and named his miracle Hasti (existence). According to Biruni, he was knowledgeable about Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Hinduism, and Shamanism. Philosophy According to Abu'l Ma'ali, the author of bayan al- Adyan, Iranshahri considered himself a Prophet and wrote a book in Persian which he claimed have received a divine revelation by the angel called Hasti (Existence). He believed in the unity of all religions and considered existing differences among them the results of special interests (·∏°ara≈º¬µ) of their followers. According to Biruni, Iranshahri had said that God took covenant from light and darkness on the days of Nowruz and Mehragan, which may reflect Zurvanite influence. According to Nasir Khusraw, Iranshahri had expressed philosophical concepts in religious terms in such books as Ketab-e jalil and Ketab-e athir, and had led people to the true religion and the understanding of monotheism. He maintained that God was always a creator, and there was not a time when he was non-creative (u-rƒÅ ·π£on ø nabud) before He turned into being creative. According to him, it is requisite that He always be creator, then it is necessary for that in which His creation appeared to be eternal (qadim). His creation makes its appearance (padid-ƒÅyanda ast) in Matter (hayulƒÅ), and therefore, Matter, a sign of the apparent power of God, is eternal; and since Matter, which is eternal, requires the existence of Space (makƒÅn), it follows that Space should be eternal too. His ideas on time were that time, world, and duration (zamƒÅn dahr wa moddat) are names whose meanings are derived from the same essence (jawhar). He also philosophized that Time, a substance in motion and restless (jawhar-e ravanda wa biqarƒÅr), is the sign of God's knowledge, in the same way that Space is the sign of His power; motion is the sign of His action, and the being (jesm) is the sign of His ability, and every one of these signs is infinite and eternal.

Germain. The film follows the life story of David Newell, better known as Mr. McFeely from the children's television show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. This was released two months after the series' 40th anniversary. Speedy Delivery is the first film about Mister Rogers. Shot in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the film is a character study of Newell, examining his mission to help save \\"The Neighborhood\\" following the death of his close friend Fred Rogers. Made on a budget of $4,000, it was funded by grants from two universities: Carnegie Mellon University and Pomona College. It aired regionally on PBS and was screened at The Feel Good Film Festival founded by Kristen Ridgway Flores, Flyway Film Festival, and the 2009 Seattle Children's Film Festival. Plot Speedy Delivery follows David Newell/Mr. McFeely around his own neighborhood, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, examining the two roles he has played for over forty years. Intercut with retrospective interviews, the film explores Newell's life of service, as both playing the character Mr. McFeely and as director of public relations for Family Communications, Inc., the parent company founded by Fred Rogers. This company created and produced Mister Rogers' Neighborhood during the majority of its years on air since its debut in 1967. The film follows Newell on four appearances located in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Beginning in Pittsburgh, he appears at the opening of the Schenley Plaza Carousel, meeting and greeting with fans. Next, he travels to Baltimore, Maryland to help open up a special Mister Rogers traveling exhibit, including a replica of the set. Finally, he returns to Pittsburgh for two more appearances in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania and Cranberry Park. All along the way, the film uses retrospective interviews with former cast members and current co-workers to discuss topics like Newell's childhood, the passing of Fred Rogers, where the character Mr. McFeely came from and what kept Mister Rogers' Neighborhood successful and authentic for over four decades. Alternate versions There are two cuts of Speedy Delivery. The theatrical cut runs approximately one hour and twelve minutes. The television cut runs approximately fifty-seven minutes, standard for PBS specifications. The theatrical cut is available on DVD and includes a director's commentary.

It's not entirely known how they are dispersed, but one idea is that they have evolved to avoid seed dispersal since doing so in such inhospitable environments might not be conducive to its reproduction.Bown, Deni (2000).

There are 30 species of Bucephalandra which have been discovered in Borneo and have been formally described by S.Y. Wong and P.C. Boyce. Most of the species are found in Borneo. Bucephalandra are usually found growing as dense mats over stones or rocks in streams or rivers in moist tropical forest.Bown, Deni (2000). Aroids: Plants of the Arum Family. Timber Press. .  Etymology  Bucephalandra is derived from Greek words, Œ≤Œø·ø¶œÇ (bous; bull or cow), Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ (kephalƒì; head) and ·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ (anƒìr; man), referring to the shape of the single male (staminate) flowers.  Description  These rheophytic (very seldom facultative) herbs can be minute to rather large, about 2 cm to 60 cm tall. Their stems are creeping and rooting, with a few or many leaves. The leaves can be quite delicate or tough and their shapes can be elliptic, oblong, linear, oblanceolate or obovate. Most of the leaf surfaces are rather glossy and the colours of the leaf range from dark blue-green to green, often with white to yellow to red tinges or spots on the back of the leaves. Inflorescence can be solitary or in pair to several. Spathes are mostly white with flush (a few of them are yellow) and shapes can be ellipsoid to lanceolate, narrowing to a point. The limbs (upper part of spathes) drop off during staminate anthesis, leaving the persistent funnel-shaped lower part of the spathe. Spadix consist of a few or no pistillodes at the base, pistillate zone, a few rows of scale-like motile staminodes (interstice staminodes), staminate zone, and appendix. Pistils are depressed globose or depressed trapezoidal in shape, 1-locular and with many ovules. Stamens consist of short filaments with thecae at the tip, dehiscing by a pore. Pollens squeezed out from the theca pore like a droplet. Fruits are berries with round to ellipsoidal shapes.  Anthesis and role of interstice staminodes  The scale-like motile staminodes sandwiched by pistillate and staminate flower zones are called interstice staminodes. These staminodes play a role in controlling pollinators' access to the pistillate flower zone and to protect the developing fruits. During pistillate anthesis, the spathe inflates to create a slit in the limb, stigmas become sticky and emit odour to attract pollinatros, and the interstice staminodes and thecae erect, allowing pollinators to access pistillate zone. When stigmas become non-receptive, the interstice staminodes begin to lower and seal off the lower spathe. During staminate athesis, the staminate flower thecae point upward and emit odour. Shortly after that, the limb splits away from the lower spathe, coincidentally pollen droplet extrudes from the tips of the theca horns. Once the fertilization is successful, the interstice staminodes become photosynthetic, thicken, and harden until the fruits are fully developed. The enlarged berries push the staminodes up and staminodes shed away. The fruits are exposed and quickly become gooey pulp embedded with seeds.  Seed dispersal of Bucephalandra  The seeds of Bucephalandra are dispersed by splash-cup mechanism; water droplets splash into the funnel-shape lower spathe and this motion ejects the seeds. The seeds will then anchor on the mosses or tiny fissures on the surrounding rock. Species  #Bucephalandra akantha S.Y. Wong & P. C. Boyce #Bucephalandra aurantiitheca S.Y. Wong & P. C.

Little, Jr. came up with the idea of renting out the theater for the summer months to present plays. Renting the theater allowed him to begin fulfilling his lifelong dream of owning and operating a quality professional theater. Entering into the first \\"Summer of Musicals,\\" Little was fresh out of graduate school in New York where he had been studying and doing work in the professional theater. When Little began the theater, he called it \\"Summer of Musicals\\" until he actually purchased The Grand Theatre in 1963 and officially changed the name to \\"The Little Theatre on the Square.\\" Mr. Little continued to bring many plays and musicals to the small town throughout his ownership of the theater.Shervey, Beth Conway. The Little Theatre on the Square : Four Decades of a Small-Town Equity Theatre. New York: Southern Illinois UP, 2000. 1-113. After twenty-two years of operating the theater, Mr. Little announced that he would not be putting on a twenty-third season due to the cost of operation and salaries for the stars and supporting actors. Although the twenty-third season was not run by Little, it did occur thanks to Sullivan Theatre, Inc. which put on five shows for the season. With the resignation of Little, the theater went from an independently owned business to a non-profit enterprise. The theater began operating as a not for profit organization in 1981 and continued to produce many plays and musicals. It was run by a board of trustees who represented the regional market area of Central Illinois.Stephens, John. \\"The Little Theatre On The Square Announces 2008 Summer Season Auditions.\\" Shelbyville Daily Union 28 Feb. 2008.

In the year 2000, the theater purchased another building that was used for rehearsal space, a dance studio, and apartments that would house the actors during their stay.

Formally known as Students‚Äô Theatre Arts Reach (S.T.A.R.), the current Future Stars Program provides educational opportunities in the Arts for people ages three through adult. The outreach program was expanded in January, 2004 by adding a touring program to S.T.A.R. The program allowed the students participating in the program to tour to area schools and offer their performances. More than 26,000 students in the area benefited from the tour program before it was discontinued. Currently,The Little Theatre offers two shows during the school year (one in the fall and one in the spring) where area schools can attend a live performance on their stage. In 2017, the education program became Future Stars Dance & Drama and features visiting artists who are working professionals teaching acting, dance and voice. Students form a 50+ mile radius are enrolled in the program. The website is http://danceanddrama.org/home  Adopt a Seat  In 2004, after the theater had finished renovations it began a program called \\"Adopt a Seat.\\" It is a program for theater patrons that allows them to have their name, or the name of someone they want to honor, placed on the seating chart plaque that is located in the lobby. Patrons who wish to participate in this program are asked to donate $1000 to the operating budget and can do so over a three-year period. As of now, over one hundred patrons have agreed to participate in the Adopt-A-Seat program and the money has helped The Little Theatre with the cost of renovations and putting on shows.http://www.thelittletheatre.org/ The Little Theatre On The Square], 30 October 2008>  Cast  Many different actors, both famous and relatively unknown, have shown up on stage throughout the many seasons of the theater in Sullivan.

His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker. He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati. He attended the Catholic Bishop DuBourg High School. In his younger days, Dorsey worked occasionally as a fashion model. By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open-source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by taxicab companies. Dorsey attended the University of Missouri‚ÄìRolla for two-plus years (1995‚Äì97) before transferring to New York University, but he dropped out in 1999, one semester short of graduating. He came up with the idea that he developed as Twitter while studying at NYU. While working on dispatching as a programmer, Dorsey moved to California. In 2000, Dorsey started his company in Oakland to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web. His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a \\"frictionless service market\\". In July 2000, building on dispatching and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service. When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared easily among friends. He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging. Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status-message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks. The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams, a co-founder of that firm in 2005 who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger. Career =Twitter= Dorsey in 2008 Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter, Inc., with Dorsey as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). As CEO, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by venture capitalists. He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits, such as yoga and fashion design. As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority, even over creating revenue‚Äîwhich, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn. Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features. He says his three guiding principles, which he says the company shares, are simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship. On October 16, 2008, Williams took over as CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board. During his time as chairman, Dorsey joined several State Department delegations, including a trip to Iraq in April 2009, led by Jared Cohen.https://www.wired.com/2009/07/ff- iraq/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/5204148/Founder-of- Twitter-sent-to-save- Iraq.htmlhttp://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1893244,00.html In November, when Iranians took to the streets in the Green Revolution, Twitter was scheduled to conduct maintenance of its site, which would entail temporarily shutting down Twitter's servers. Dorsey responded to a request from Cohen to delay the maintenance so that it would not affect the revolution in Iran, because Iranians were using Twitter to communicate and coordinate. Since President Obama had announced that there would be no meddling in Iran, the move sparked controversy.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/world/middleeast/17media.htmlhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/02/the- consequentialisthttps://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/will-the- revolution-be-tweeted In February 2010, Dorsey was part of another State Department delegation, this time to Russia.https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/world/europe/24russia.htmlhttps://fortune.com/2010/02/24/getting- punkd-in-russia/ On March 28, 2011, he returned to Twitter as executive chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as CEO. On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced his resignation as CEO, effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey assumed the post of interim CEO upon Costolo's departure. He was named permanent CEO on October 5, 2015. On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey said it was a hoax. Dorsey and President Barack Obama at Twitter Town Hall in July 2011 In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This was an attempt to entice new users, since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 from about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014. On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter account with 3.9 million followers. After restoring the account, Dorsey tweeted that the suspension was due to an \\"internal mistake\\". In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestani matched a $530,000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers. Their match brought the total donation to $1.59 million. In March 2018, Dorsey announced that an improved version of the verification system would be coming to Twitter. The purpose of redesigning verification was to let people verify more facts about themselves, emphasizing proof of identity. The overhaul was not in place before the U.S midterm election of 2018 to help in verifying the identities of the candidates. In September 2018, Dorsey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee alongside Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg about meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Following this testimony, Twitter shares fell 6 percent. President Donald Trump with Dorsey in the Oval Office of the White House on April 23, 2019 Dorsey met privately with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House and discussed Trump's concerns that Twitter had limited or removed some of his Twitter followers, and those of conservatives. After the meeting, Dorsey tweeted that their discussion included making Twitter \\"healthier and more civil\\". A week earlier, Dorsey took part in a TED talk about the social media platform's spread of abuse and misinformation, which has brought him criticism. On August 30, 2019, Dorsey's personal Twitter account was allegedly breached for nearly an hour by a group calling itself the Chuckling Squad, posting and retweeting numerous racist tweets. On October 23, 2019, Twitter's stock price fell by nearly 24 percent, from $38.83 to $30.75. The reason was an earnings miss off a third-quarter report, which Twitter blamed on ad targeting problems. Dorsey had been making a concerted effort to dampen the effect that Twitter had on political elections, which entailed banning all political ads. This was also seen as a large contributor to the drop. Dorsey announced that, as of November 22, 2019, Twitter would ban all political advertising. The policy applies globally to all marketing campaigns about political issues. On February 29, 2020, it was announced that activist hedge fund Elliott Management led by billionaire Paul Singer was looking to oust Dorsey and nominate four directors to Twitter's board, including Elliott's senior portfolio manager Jesse Cohn. Dorsey received support from entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, among others. The two parties reached an agreement days later, with Dorsey remaining CEO. In October 2020, Dorsey was one of several tech firm CEOs subpoenaed by the US Senate Commerce Committee. Republican Roger Wicker, who chairs the committee, led the charge to force the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google to testify about the legal immunity the tech platforms receive under Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934. =Square, Inc.= Dorsey in 2018 Dorsey, along with co-founder Jim McKelvey, developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader, allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS. The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009 to over 100 by June 2011. Square's office is on Market Street in San Francisco. In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at US$3.2 billion. Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc. On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. As of that date, Dorsey owned 24.4 percent of the company. In March 2020 the FDIC permitted Square to open a bank. It announced plans to launch Square Financial Services in 2021. In May 2020, Dorsey extended to Square employees the same offer he made to those at Twitter, the option to work from home permanently. In 2020, Square began withholding for months up to 30 percent of the funds that merchants collected from customers using its Cash App. =Other projects= In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor. Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him. He served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011. Dorsey is an on-record donor to Democratic Party candidates. Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. In January 2018, it was reported that Dorsey would not seek reelection at Disney's March annual meeting, due to increased difficulty with conflicts of interest. Dorsey is a board member of the Berggruen Institute's Governance Center. Personal life In 2012, Dorsey moved to the Sea Cliff neighborhood of San Francisco. He walks five miles to work each morning and calls it a \\"very clearing time\\". He is a fan of Kendrick Lamar's music and of French radio station FIP. In late 2017, Dorsey completed ten days of meditation known as VipassanƒÅ taught by followers of S. N. Goenka. Dorsey said he was \\"aware of the human rights atrocities\\" in Myanmar. Dorsey has contributed financially to the campaigns of Democratic presidential candidates Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang.

The construction of Ladd Tower necessitated that the Ladd Carriage House, directly adjacent the construction site, temporarily be moved from its foundation; it returned in October 2008. The building is managed by Holland Residential, which also has commercial space on the ground floor. The main residential tower also shares space on the first through third floors with an adjacent church. The tower is Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified. The $80 million building stands tall. The tower was originally slated to sell as condominiums. Only 60 of 200 units were presold. In 2007, Opus Northwest converted the project to rental apartments, returning deposits to approximately 60 buyers. The building was redesigned, with shorter ceilings, leaving the overall building height unchanged, but going from 21 to 23 floors. The apartments were smaller, at 332 apartments, versus 189 condos in the original plan. The original design of the tower put the building flush against the South Park Blocks. A 27-foot setback beginning at the fourth story garnered \\"unanimous approval from the Portland Design Commission, a dramatic turnaround from icy receptions to two earlier proposals\\", according to The Oregonian.

Quex-Ul appeared in the television series Krypton, portrayed by Gordon Alexander. Publication history Quex-Ul first appeared in Superman #157 and was created by Curt Swan and Edmond Hamilton. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= First appearing in Superman #157 (Nov. 1962), Quex-Ul was a Kryptonian exiled to the Phantom Zone when he was convicted of killing Rondors, an endangered species, to use their healing horns for the purpose of profit. He confessed and spent his time in the Zone, but was released by Superman when his time was up. Not a grateful sort, he attempted to lure Superman into a gold kryptonite trap, until Superman discovered that Quex-Ul had actually acted under the mental control of another Kryptonian, Rog-Ar, the true rondor killer. Learning this, Quex-Ul threw himself into the trap to save the hero, losing his powers and memory. In the 1982 The Phantom Zone mini-series, he later works at the Daily Planet, believing himself to be an Earthman named \\"Charlie Kweskill\\". Susceptible to unconscious influence by Phantom Zoners, he unwittingly frees them and is himself trapped in the Zone along with Superman. Together they seek a way out of the Zone, ultimately facing a malevolent entity called Aethyr, whose mind creates the Phantom Zone. On arrival, Superman and Quex-Ul find themselves wearing each other's clothes, and \\"Charlie\\" wonders if he now has super powers. It is unclear whether his powers or memory have actually been restored, the costume swap having been effected as some sort of amusement by Aethyr. To save the Man of Steel, Quex- Ul flies towards Aethyr and dies in a shower of fiery breath, sacrificing his life in a final act of redemption. =Post-Crisis= John Byrne. In the Pocket Universe (which was an alternate version of the pre-Crisis Earth-One), Quex-Ul was freed with General Zod and Zaora from the Phantom Zone by a naive Lex Luthor, whereupon they turned Pocket Earth into a dead world. Quex-Ul and the others were executed by Superman using green kryptonite, a controversial move that haunted him for some time. =Adventure Comics= In Adventure Comics 512 (late May 2010), Quex-Ul makes an appearance under the cover name of Edward Robertson. He was later killed by Squad K of Project 7734. He is also shown in the Phantom Zone with General Zod and the rest of the Phantom Zone criminals, including Jax-Ur, Non, Ursa, Car-Vex, Az-Rel and Nadira. His was a plan developed by Car-Vex aka Officer Romundi and General Sam Lane. Powers and abilities Like all Kryptonians, Quex-Ul possesses superhuman abilities derived from the yellow solar radiation of the sun of Earth's solar system. His basic abilities are superhuman strength, superhuman speed and superhuman stamina sufficient to bend steel in his bare hands, overpower a locomotive, leap over a tall building in a single bound and outrun a speeding bullet; he possesses heightened senses of hearing and sight including X-ray vision as well as telescopic and microscopic vision; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing; longevity; powerful freezing breath; heat vision; and flight. In other media =Television= * Quex-Ul appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Field Trip\\" with his vocal effects provided by Jason J. Lewis. This version is a large Kryptonian with a beard and no hair. As Superman gives Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl a tour of the Fortress of Solitude and are shown the Phantom Zone Projector, General Zod, Faora, and Quex-Ul are released and Superman is accidentally sent to the Phantom Zone. Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl attempt to use a Green Kryptonite fragment on them only for it to be too small for them. Under the yellow sun, General Zod and his two followers gain superpowers and end up in a fight with Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl. As Blue Beetle and Stargirl hold off the Kryptonian villains, Firestorm uses Martin Stein's guidance to learn how to transmutate anything to Kryptonite. Testing on the ice, Firestorm transmutates it to Green Kryptonite which weakens General Zod and his two followers. Afterwards, Superman is freed from the Phantom Zone and General Zod and his followers are thrown into the Phantom Zone. * Quex-Ul appears in Krypton, portrayed by Gordon Alexander, where he's a member of the Military Guild/Kandor's Sagitari and the commander of Lyta-Zod's squadron. In \\"House of El\\", Lyta discovers that the Military Guild plans to purge the slums to draw out Black Zero terrorists and challenges Quex-Ul to a duel to the death for command of the squadron. Lyta then manages to defeat him in combat and mercilessly kills him, despite his pleas for mercy, allowing Lyta to take over as commander of the squadron. =Novels= * In several 'Choose Your Own Adventure'-type novels, Quex-Ul was one of the three prominent Phantom Zone criminals, notable for the fact that he was already very strong before he was exposed to a yellow sun. However, he was not exceptionally intelligent, and relied on General Zod to tell him what to do. This portrayal was more like Non, the movie villain who served as the basis for Quex-Ul's Post-Crisis incarnation.

Biography =Early life and education= Harold Raymond Wayne Benjamin was born March 27, 1893 in Gilmanton, Wisconsin to Harold and Harriet Benjamin. He moved to Oregon with his family in 1904, and graduated from Tualatin Academy in 1910. Benjamin earned degrees from both the Oregon Normal School and the University of Oregon. He later received a Ph.D. from the Stanford Graduate School of Education in 1927 (Ohles 112). =Career= Benjamin‚Äôs professional career was extremely long and illustrious. He began his teaching career at Salem Heights Elementary School in 1915. Benjamin then became the superintendent of schools in Umatilla, Oregon until 1922. He moved on to become an assistant professor of education at the University of Oregon until 1925. Benjamin decided to take a job at Stanford University as a teaching fellow before deciding to enroll in their student teaching program in 1927. After completion of the program in 1931, he moved on to the University of Minnesota where he was a professor of education and the assistant dean of the college of education until 1936. Benjamin decided to take a job at the University of Colorado as the director of the college of education for two years. After two years in Colorado, he took a position as the dean of the college of education at the University of Maryland, College Park where he served for twelve years. In 1951, Benjamin became the chairman of social foundations of education at Peabody College in Tennessee where he ended his career in education in 1958 (Ohles 112). In his career, Benjamin was also a noted figure in comparative international education. He traveled to many Latin countries comparing the way the U.S. and other countries ran their higher education systems, which led him to writing a well-known book Higher Education in the American Republic (Guthrie 169). Harold R.W. Benjamin‚Äôs main purpose in his work was to preserve the democratic processes in American schooling and for an awakening of instructional consciousness toward individual differences. This belief led him to writing another well known book, The Saber-Tooth Curriculum. The Saber-Tooth Curriculum was written by Benjamin in a pseudo name of J. Abner Peddiwell. Published in 1939, The Saber-Tooth Curriculum is satirical commentary explaining how unexamined traditions of schooling can result in resisting needed changes (Guthrie 169). He believed education needs to be responsive to the emerging needs of the life experience and he felt education in his time was sticking to teachings of old rather than of present times.

Westi stood for Westinghouse Terminal Interactive. Westi provided an interface and access method for programmers to 'talk' to monitors and handle data entry. Such access methods later became known as APIs and the handlers a form of transaction processing. In 1981, WESTI was considered the main competitor to CICS, holding second place in market share for IBM mainframe transaction processing monitors. Initially written for the IBM 2260 running under DOS on IBM mainframes, the original product was offered free for IBM users. With the advent of DOS/VS and the IBM 3270 series terminals, Westinghouse realized they could recover part of their development costs and commercialized the product, circa 1970. The company added transparent remote access about 1980. Westi consumed less memory than CICS, which was attractive in the highly memory- constrained computing environments of the 1970s, in which 256KB was considered a large amount of memory. Westi operated as an application's mainline program and, like IBM's soon to follow CICS, programmers wrote subroutines to read and write data to and from terminals and discs. This real time paradigm became known as transaction processing. This differed from Westi's primary competitor, DUCS, which reversed that model in that it was a subroutine package that read from and wrote to monitors. While Westi was not as easy to program and use as DUCS, Westi (like CICS) handled task management. In terms of speed, Westi fell between DUCS and the considerably more process-bound CICS.  Development  = Pittsburgh = Steve Robert O'Donnell wrote the original DOS 2260 package, which was distributed free of charge. Its popularity made Westinghouse realize Westi had potential as a commercial product. = Columbus = In 1972, IBM released DOS/VS with the IBM/370 and the first IBM 3270 terminals, and the Westinghouse Software group began a rewrite for new products. Several new team members were assigned, including John Gaston, who took over lead development following the departure of Steve O'Donnell in the latter 1970s. (Steve O'Donnell went on to found GOAL Systems, Inc.) = Paris = Westinghouse Marketing suffered a schism about the same time, and the result was that Europe established an independent subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Management Systems, SA, or WEMSSA, headquartered in Paris. At that point, the Westinghouse product line, WDU and WESTI, bifurcated, taking independent development paths. = Orlando = The original development team moved to Orlando, Florida, where it eventually came under the management of Dr. Ray Ferguson and focused on integration with VSE and matching features with CICS. = Avignon = WEMSSA, under the direction of Eric Lutaud, contracted with GOAL Systems and eventually developer Leigh Lundin (author of DUCS Remote) for development, which focused on adding remote teleprocessing in Avignon, France. The result was WestiTAM, a 4k bi-sync module, which the Florida group expressed an interest in. In 1978, WEMSSA resumed relations with the Florida group and eventually the two merged, coming under the new director of WEMSSA in London, David Hazlewood. Westinghouse committed to remerging the product line, re-engineering new products under the direction of Dr. Ferguson and Leigh Lundin. However, part way into development, Westinghouse began to break up the division during the outsourcing thrust of the Reaganomics era. Through badly managed negotiations, Westinghouse ended up with neither developers or outsourcing partners, which spelled the end for one of the industries foremost software groups.  Marketing  Westinghouse Electric Management Systems, SA (WEMSSA), had sales offices in Pittsburgh, San Jose, Paris, Lyon, London, Geneva, Z√ºrich, Munich, and Amsterdam.

In the early 1800s it was known as the finest hotel in America, west of Albany. It has been home to several Niagara County businessmen and honored guests. The building has been on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Niagara County, New York since 1974. It has served as a hotel, private home, a fine dining restaurant, museum, and a fast food establishment (McDonald's). It is found in Western New York, about ten minutes from Niagara Falls. Note: This includes and Accompanying two photographs Early history The Frontier House, built in 1824, is situated at 460 Center Street, Lewiston, New York, of Niagara County and was hailed as the best hotel west of Albany. Prominent business men of Lewiston, Benjamin and Samuel Barton along with Joshua Fairbanks headed the building of the tavern.Dictionary of New York Historic Places, Volume two. New York: Somerset Publishers, 1997. The Frontier House was constructed of stone from the Bay of Quinte at the Northeastern end of Lake Ontario. 18 men worked 18 months in laying up the solid stone 30-inch walls. Fifteen fireplaces would keep visitors warm. Everyone in town could see the smoke bellowing from the chimneys on the east and west side of the building. It was an imposing structure that fulfilled Benjamin Barton's expectations and was ready to house Gov. Dewitt Clinton and other state officials who came to Lewiston after the official opening of the Erie Canal in Lockport. When completed, the structure stood four stories tall. Its rectangular shape, double parallel chimneys, oval windows, full-width porch and hipped roof is characterized as the Federal style of architecture. Benjamin Barton's office was on the first floor with a large ballroom on the second floor. The third floor included fourteen bedrooms with fireplaces and the fourth floor was used for meetings, famously for free masons. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic places on July 8, 1974. Guests Dewitt Clinton, President William McKinley, Samuel Clemens, Charles Dickens, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John L. Sullivan and Jenny Lind were all honored guests of the Frontier House. In the 1800s ten coach trains arrived and departed from the Frontier House hotel daily carrying these among other influential people.Laurie, Margaret S. Lewiston:Crown Jewel of Niagara.

George Rector purchased the inn and added the Frontier House Restaurant. Daughters of Rector inherited the hotel in the 1930s. In the economic boom of the 1960s area factories in Niagara Falls were welcoming newcomers at a rate of 11,000. The Frontier House rented its rooms to sleep three for each eight-hour shift because of the growing demand for housing. In June 1964, Mr. and Mrs. James Russell of Buffalo renovated the hotel into a museum and restaurant. Dining rooms, the Lafayette Ballroom was named on the second floor, a Victorian parlor and Early American bedroom styles were presented on the third floor and the fourth was private quarters. In September 1973, the manager and chef of Frontier House were rescued in a fire. One dining room was destroyed along with widespread water damage.\\"Historic Restaurant is damaged in fire.\\" Niagara Gazette, 1973. Two years later the historic hotel of Lewiston's future was handed to William McDonald, who restored the interior and leased it to the McDonald's food chain.

This pre-Incan culture, which overlaps with surrounding Paracas, Moche, and Nasca civilizations, was located in the desert coastal strip of Peru in the Chillon, Rimac and Lurin River valleys. It can be difficult to differentiate the Lima culture from surrounding cultures due to both its physical proximity to other, and better documented cultures, in Coastal Peru, and because it is chronologically very close, if not over lapped, by these other cultures as well. These factors all help contribute to the obscurity of the Lima culture, of which much information is still left to be learned. The Lima civilization was known in part for its ceramic artwork, consisting of styles such as Maranga and Interlocking patterns, which show the influence of the nearby Moche culture. Changes in this pottery style during the Middle Horizon Period also indicate influence from the Wari Empire. Being surrounded by desert, Lima needed to channel water from surrounding rivers in order to cultivate their soil for agricultural purposes. This resulted in the construction and maintenance of an extensive irrigational system, redirecting canals, and method of terracing. The Lima civilization constructed many temples known as wak'as, which are still preserved throughout the city of Lima to this day. Since these archeological sites are buried within modern-day Lima, it is difficult to access the archeological remnants that still exist without disrupting the city, which is another factor that plays a part in the modern-day enigma of ancient Lima culture. Major population centers of ancient Lima were located at Pukllana, Wallamarka, Cajamarquilla, and Pacha Kamaq.Kipfer, Barbara Ann. Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology.

Early development and expansion The history of early Andean culture is essentially the story of a long process in which man learned to dominate nature, turning a desert into a green oasis. Within the Central Coast there is a strong pattern of architectural evidence that suggests organized communal and cultural activity during the Preceramic and Early Horizon Periods. This set the foundations for development of the Lima culture in the Early Intermediate. Despite the desert conditions prevailing in the coastal region, two factors enabled to areas earliest inhabitants to live off the land. First, the proximity to the sea which provided these groups with a diet of fish and shellfish. The second was the varied climate: from May to October moisture trapped by the hills fed vegetation in the slopes, which early populations could use to supplement their seafood diet. Later populations were able to develop a limited and primitive agriculture in low- lying areas, irrigated by nearby rivers and freshwater springs. During the Early Horizon Period, groups began to have the advantage of regular rainfall, and they learned how to domesticate plants and animals. A population surplus also led movement towards the coast. This brings us to the Early Intermediate period, where the Lima culture (among many others within a close time period) began to flourish. These cultures learned how to control nature, creating expansive irrigation systems and artificial canals. These systems provide further evidence of the sophistication of the social organization of the Lima culture, which would have been needed to construct, run, and maintain these irrigation systems. In Coastal Peru, the middle group of rivers of Rimac, Chillon, and Lurin (which flow through what is now metropolitan Lima) serve as the backdrop for the culturally complex and inter-related Lima culture. Small, village scale pyramidal structures in the beginning of the Early Intermediate would slowly transform into the well-organized focus of the successive Lima culture. Evidence of the expansion of Lima culture in ceramics and textiles can be found in surrounding valleys, allowing archaeologists to track the progression of the culture over time. At the start of the Early Intermediate, population was focused in the upper portion of the Lurin valley, characterized by isolated free standing-houses and short irrigation canals. The population gradually expanded, moving down the valley, and utilizing longer irrigation canals to inter-connected dwellings, and eventually major cities and cultural centers. Elite structures on hilltops also began to occur, which would ultimately become the important Huacas of Lima culture. Near the end of the Early Intermediate Period the Lima culture became entirely dominant. Perhaps the most important center of the culture was the wak'a of Pacha Kamaq, which would continue to be important to many cultures for the next 1000 years.Keatinge, Richard W. Peruvian Prehistory : An Overview of Pre-Inca and Inca Society. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1988. Print. Major centers =Pucllana= Wak'a Pukllana and characteristic adobitos. Miraflores District, Lima Wak'a Pukllana was a central archeological complex in ancient Lima culture. Also known as Wak'a Juliana, this important administrative and ceremonial center was built around 500. The Wak'a Pukllana was clearly separated by a large wall (north - south direction) into two different parts: The administrative sector and the urban zone were located towards the east of this wall with places presumably used for public meetings, to discuss control and improvement of production. A number of small buildings, squares, ramps, patios and storage rooms completed this part. The ceremonial sector towards the western part of the wall, contained the pyramid (made of adobe bricks, 500 metres long, more than 100 metres wide, 22 metres high) and adjacent places. In this area priests conducted religious ceremonies honoring the Gods and ancestors.[\\"Huaca Pucllana (Juliana) - Adobe Pyramid.\\" Huaca Pucllana. Web. 08 March 2012. ]. The structure of this wak'a serves to strongly reinforce our concepts of the authoritative composition of the Lima culture, clearly indicating a separation between the common population, the administration of the culture, and the religious leaders.Isbell, William Harris, and Helaine Silverman. Andean Archaeology I: Variations in Sociopolitical Organization. New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum, 2002. Print =Wak'a Wallamarka= The archaeological compound of Wak'a Wallamarka is only a little smaller than Wak'a Pukllana, and is similarly an adobe scaled pyramid, but this wak'a possesses the unique addition of an impressive access ramp. It is believed that this site was a ceremonial center whose access was possibly restricted to only a religious elite, evinced by the fact that the uncovered floors show little wear from use. Since Wak'a Wallamarka endured over a very long period (one that goes from the 3rd century to the coming of the Incas during the 15th century) the patterns of utilization and abandonment are extremely helpful in indicating the shift in funerary practices over time. This site continues to be a significant source of information for ancient burial practices of the Lima and surrounding cultures. The on-site museum today has examples of funeral bundles and the mummy of a local princess.\\"Lima Archaeological and Historical Sites.\\" Welcome to Peru. Web. 6 March 2012. . =Cajamarquilla= The Wak'a Cajamarquilla, located in the Rimac valley, was not a major commercial, not administrative, and not a military site during the Early Intermediate Period, being built around 400-600. Also referred to as \\"the dead city,\\" Cajamarquilla is entirely built in adobe and is unique in the aspect that it is also comprised by a peculiar set of walled palaces. Cajamarquilla does ' stand out as the second biggest urban complex constructed with mud in the ancient Per√∫, with its 167 hectares of extension, surpassed only by the citadel of Chan Chan to the North of Lima.[\\"Lima Archaeological and Historical Sites.\\" Welcome to Peru. http://www.hostellacasanostra.com/hostel-lima- peru/archeological-lima-peru.html]. This site is contested to have been founded by the Huari civilization, but nonetheless was developed while the valley was under the influence of the Lima culture. This centre of regional influence was assembled by pyramids, squares, streets, rooms and mazes clearly distinguishable in the midst of an arid landscape, harshly beaten by floods during the El Ni√±o phenomenon appearances. Nevertheless, this place sustained a very complete and dynamic civilization, as asserted by: the many human burials located in several sectors; the different decorations on objects, some typical of the valley itself, others from the rest of the Coast and others from the southern Sierra; the many underground cellars to keep food; and by the patios devoted to the production of chicha (an alcoholic beverage obtained from the maceration of corn) for celebrations.[\\"Lima Archaeological and Historical Sites.\\" Welcome to Peru. http://www.hostellacasanostra.com/hostel- lima-peru/archeological-lima-peru.html] =Pachacamac= Wak'a Pacha Kamaq, noted for its great pyramidal temples and frescoed adobe walls, is one of the most important and remarkable sites constructed in the Early Intermediate Period. The shrine of this site was dedicated to the god pacha Kamaq, \\"architect of the world and creator of all its creatures\\". Wak'a Pacha Kamaq was the most distinguished pilgrimage destination along the coastal region, drawing worshippers from all over Peru to render tribute and to consult the oracle. The adobe style temple, built entirely on raw mudbricks, has a raised rectangular space in front of it where pilgrims could leave their offerings. This vast religious complex is credited to the Lima culture, being initially constructed and occupied between 200 BC‚ÄìAD 600. Pacha Kamaq continued to be utilized for well over the next thousand years. The Wari culture arrived in the region around 650 and began to use the city as an administrative center for the coastal Andes. Wari influences appear in the construction of the site and on the ceramics and textiles of this period. Pacha Kamaq was so recognizably crucial to the surrounding cultures, that even after the Inka conquest of the area it was left intact and untampered. The Inka civilization instead allowed it to exist along their own practices, adding their own style to the development. In fact the Inka sector, which was added between 1440 - 1533, remains as the best preserved section today.[\\"Lima Archaeological and Historical Sites.\\" Welcome to Peru.

Material culture Skull of a royalty member of the Lima people. =Textiles= Textiles were considered a symbol of status and wealth, many mummies have been found wrapped in many layers of the finest embroidered tapestries symbolizing a person of power in society. They were constructed of a variation of fibers from plants, usually cotton, and various animal furs (usually alpaca or llama). The particular styles of textile in Lima culture have transformed and evolved over time, yielding a variety of textile patterns throughout the culture's history. Segments of Lima culture weaved fine-looking multicolored tapestries and blankets and dyed their creations with natural dyes of which they created more than 190 different shades. At certain periods the textiles used geometric, anthropomorphous and animal designs such as birds and felines. Depicting inanimate objects as animals is a common practice in Andean art, which conveys an association between the object and the qualities that the animal embodies. Textiles would be woven for everything from everyday clothing, to ceremonial robes for religious and political elites, burial mantels and wall-hangings for temples and palaces. It is also clear that the ancient Lima culture appreciated pattern and design for its own sake, as seen in their extensive use of the interlocking pattern in their designs. In this pattern, a series of geometrically stylized animal or human figures interlock so skillfully that the same pattern appears when the fabric is looked at from upside down, and sometimes it is difficult or impossible to determine where one image ends and another starts.[\\"Cloth & Clay: Communicating Culture.\\" Moche. Web. 08 March 2012. http://www.textilemuseum.ca/cloth_clay/LTOS/moche.cfm]. =Written communication= Since the Ancient Peruvians never developed a system of writing, the images and signs woven into cloths or embroidered and painted on fabrics served as a pictorial language to communicate their beliefs about their world. That language has a naturalistic base but it privileges stylization, reducing natural forms to their essential characteristics so that what is represented is a general archetype. =Ceramics= Playa Grande cup style, decorated \\"interlocking\\". MNAAHP. Bottle Niever√≠a sculptural style represents a snake. Larco Museum, Lima - Peru. The ceramics of the Lima culture was developed from the local red and white ceramics of the middle coast. Black, strong colouring and random negative ornament painting are typical of it. Geometric designs which represented crested snakes with triangle-heads are the common ornamental motifs.[\\"The Lima Culture.\\" The Lima Culture, Tampere Art Museum. Web. 08 March 2012. http://www.tampere.fi/ekstrat/taidemuseo/arkisto/peru/800/lima_en.htm]. Ceramics were constructed in various ways, but the use of mold technology is evident. This would have enabled the mass production of certain forms. Ceramics of the Lima culture vary widely in shape and theme, with important social activities documented in pottery, including war, sex, metalwork, and weaving. (SeeMoche Material Culture) =Cosmology= The world view for central Andean cultures was essentially magical-religious. They saw the world as being animated by spirits, and the fertility of the land and health of the people depended on the good will of these spirits. This explains the pattern of human sacrifices found during times of drought or flooding; sacrifices were performed to appease and show respect for the gods. This is also supported by the imagery found on ceramics and textiles depicting sacrifices for a god or deity, and tributes that were presented at temples, such as Pachacamac. =Drug use= Small mortars (grinding bowls), snuff spoons, and wooden tray artifacts indicate that drug usage was particularly prevalent in the Lima culture. Coca leaves were especially common, chewed as a substance to alleviate hypoxia and altitude sickness (useful in highland cultures) and to help ease hunger, useful in times of food scarcity. Hallucinogenic drugs, found in certain cactuses in the area, were also most likely used in religious ceremonies to induce visions, and as a method to increase closeness with the gods.Moseley, Michael Edward. The Incas and Their Ancestors: The Archaeology of Peru. New York, NY: Thames and Hudson, 1997. Print. =Iconography= Male and female figures, and even some that might be additional genders, as well as environmental information, plants, animals, architectural portrayals, subsistence activities, and so on are repeatedly portrayed in Lima culture. One scene that is particularly repetitive is the sacrifice scene, collecting the victim's blood and presenting it to a deity-like figure. From the study of iconography we can tell male and female from body shape, and thus see associated clothes, hairstyles, etc., and correlate these with activities and specific personalities. The goldwork in Colombia portrays animals, usually birds, jaguars, caimans, sharks, probably tied in with shamanism and drug use. Birds and simulations of flight are often related to the supernatural and to hallucinations generated by snuff, coca, other drugs. Specific images that are repeated are a frontal staff bearing figure which represents either human or supernatural power. Trophy heads of slain enemies are also common, and these indicate the belief that \\"blood fertilized the earth\\" and human sacrifice was required to please the gods. A two-headed snake symbolizes \\"the supernatural force that maintains the harmony of the cosmos by uniting the opposed but complementary parts making it up.\\" Special attention is also allotted to fish and sea-birds, since they were a source of food and fertilizer for the fields, and thus were the basis of life in the coastal region.[\\"South American Archaeology: Early Intermediate.\\" Indiana University. Web. 08 March 2012. http://www.indiana.edu/~arch/saa/matrix/saa/saa_mod06.html]. =Sacrifice= Sacrifice was very common in early Andean cultures, and the Lima culture is no exception. Sacrifices would be made to pacify gods, or as part as religious and ceremonial rituals. Human burials, particularly of children, found underneath dwellings related to the belief that this class of offering would contribute to the long life of the building. This custom is still rooted in the cultural tradition of Andean communities, although human beings have been replaced by animals or special objects.Isbell, William Harris, and Helaine Silverman. Andean Archaeology III: North and South. New York: Springer, 2006. Print. Authoritative forces During the Early Intermediate Period, society in Lima culture began to transition. Cultures that were once thought to be group or \\"bottom-up\\" oriented in authoritative structure, and perhaps were, began to develop a social, political, and religious elite. Wealth and power differences became especially notable in architectural structures and layouts (shown in the complexes of Pukllana, Cajamarquilla, Wallamarka, and Pacha Kamaq) as well as in contrasts in the abundance of material wealth possessed by different families. Once in power, these elite individuals must have been involved in underwriting and directing the creation of art and architecture, which further perpetuated their control over the remaining members of the group, and thus sufficiently established an elite authoritative force. Claims of an elite class are substantially supported by ceremonial burials and funerary practices uncovered by archaeologists. There are obvious differences in burials between members of the Lima culture. Certain sites, such as the Burial at Sip√°n, have been uncovered that clearly indicate an elite person. The amount and wealth of objects included in certain burials contrasted with the emptiness and simplicity of others make it obvious that there was an elite and privileged ruling class. It is also apparent that there was a religious ruling class, which is demonstrated by the enclosed construction of religious spaces and temples at important Huacas, meant to restrict access to the religious and political elite, which further reinforced elite power and made the rest of the population even more dependent on the instruction of the ruling class.Isbell, William Harris, and Helaine Silverman. Andean Archaeology. New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum, 2002. Print.Silverman, Helaine, and William Harris Isbell. Handbook of South American Archaeology. New York, NY: Springer, 2008. Print. Decline Starting around 600, climatic and environmental changes in the Andean region were brought about by cycles of droughts and El Ni√±o phenomenon. The Lima and surrounding cultures underwent radical reorganizations and shifting populations in order to compensate for the change in rainfall and water availability, which negatively impacted crops and damaged huacas and dwellings. This marked the beginning of the decline of the Lima culture. As its people were slowly dispersed across Peru in search of better and more reliable living situations, the conglomerate of Lima culture was steadily disbanded, and new culture groups developed and dominated Coastal Peru.[\\"Initial Period through Late Horizon.\\" About.com Archaeology.

This would also likely apply to a potentially habitable hypothetical moon orbiting the gas giant exoplanet (see below). =Host star= HD 153950 is an F-type star with a mass that is 1.13 times the mass of the Sun and a size that is 1.34 times the radius of the Sun. In other words, it is slightly more massive and slightly larger than the Sun is. With an effective temperature of 6076 K, HD 205739 is also hotter than the Sun, although it is younger, at an estimated age of 4.3 billion years, 250‚Äì300 million years younger than the Sun. The star is almost the same as the Sun in terms of metal; its measured metallicity is [Fe/H] = -0.01. HD 153950 cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye because the star has an apparent magnitude (V) of 7.39.  Habitability  HD 153950 b is located within the habitable zone of its star. The exoplanet, with a mass of 2.73 , is too massive to be rocky, and because of this the planet itself is not expected to habitable. However, based on a probable 10‚àí4 fraction of the planet mass as a satellite,Canup R.M., Ward W.R. (2006). A common mass scaling for satellite systems of gaseous planets. Nature, 441: 834‚Äì839. it may have a large enough moon with a sufficient atmosphere and pressure, and liquid water at its surface, potentially making it habitable.The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog: Data of Potential Habitable Worlds On the other hand, this mass can be distributed into many small satellites as well. Discovery HD 153950's designation is from the Henry Draper catalogue. The star was also observed by Hipparcos, which released its catalogue in 1997. The observations that led to the discovery of the planet HD 153950 b started when the N2K Consortium started an extended search for planets around 300 stars not usually targeted by Doppler spectroscopy surveys. In the case of HD 153950, the star was observed using telescopes at the La Silla Observatory in Chile.

It was notable as the seat of the wealthiest member of the Yorba family and as the largest adobe hacienda in Alta California. Construction On August 1, 1834, Mexican Governor Jos√© Figueroa granted to Bernardo Yorba on the north side of the Santa Ana River, about four miles upstream from the Jos√© Antonio Yorba hacienda \\"El Refugio\\" on Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana. =Bernardo Yorba Hacienda= In 1835, Bernardo Yorba began construction on a two-story adobe house that was to be one of the finest and largest in all of Alta California. Construction was completed in stages over several years. The main buildings were arranged to form three sides of a square and boasted 200 rooms, although older, more conservative accounts list at least fifty rooms. The southern face of the main structure was measured to be 106 feet in length and surviving photographs show it to be over 20 feet at the peak of the roof. Pine beams were cut and brought by oxen from the San Bernardino Mountains to add support to the structures. Indian servants who made the adobe bricks used in construction lived in their own camp closer to the river, past the chapel just east of the northern end of the old Yorba Bridge (now Imperial Highway bridge). =Iglesia de San Antonio= Around the time of Bernardo's death in 1858, a small adobe chapel, Iglesia de San Antonio, was built about 1,000 yards southwest of the residence. It was dedicated on April 29, 1860 to San Antonio, patron saint of the Yorba household. In the 1890s the adobe chapel was so weathered that a wooden church was built a few yards away on the west side. The wooden church was abandoned about 1948 and was gone by 1956. =Yorba Cemetery= About the time the adobe chapel was built, a plot of land on the hill overlooking the hacienda to its southeast was set aside as the Yorba Cemetery. Over 400 people were buried there through the 1930s. Bernardo's remains, those of his second wife, and eight other Yorbas were re-interred there in 1923 when the Old Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles was closed due to construction. The last burials were in 1939.County of Orange Life at the Hacienda The rancho headquarters, Hacienda de San Antonio, was also known as Rancho San Antonio. Other names include San Antonio de Santa Ana or San Antonio de los Yorbas. This was the center of all activity in the area in that time. In 1842, Governor Manuel Micheltorena stayed at the Yorba homestead and supplied his soldiers with provisions from the ranch. On January 6, 1847 General Stephen W. Kearny and Commodore Robert F. Stockton camped just down stream from the hacienda, in a Yorba irrigation ditch which ran from the Santa Ana River to Santa Ana Vieja. Just days later they won the Battle of Rio San Gabriel near Los Angeles, securing southern California for the Americans and leading to the end of Mexican rule in California.Stockton and Kearny Campsite marker (1976). Orange Bicentennial Commission. Being far from the nearest town, Los Angeles, Bernado Yorba thought it wise to have all the trades represented on site. There were four woolcombers, two tanners, one soapmaker, and one butter and cheese man who supervised the milking of 50 to 60 cows. There was also a harness maker, two shoe makers, a jeweler, and one plasterer as well as a carpenter and a blacksmith. Yorba also had two errand boys, one sheepherder, a cook and a baker. Also employed were two washer women, one woman to iron, four sewing women, a dressmaker, two gardeners, a schoolmaster and winemakers. Among the wines made, Angelica and Port are mentioned, as well as the distilling of whiskey and brandy. Provisions were brought all the way from San Francisco for the hacienda; dates, dried fruits, fancy crackers and candy were also supplied to surrounding ranches. About 100 Gabriele√±o Indians worked for Bernardo Yorba on the rancho, living in a nearby village. As the auxiliary alcalde, Bernardo needed a place to keep lawbreakers. A jail was located between the main residence and the schoolrooms. The dark cellar below ground was called the 'dungeon' where criminals were locked up. After the death of Bernardo Yorba in 1858, the Indian servants left and the hacienda went into a slow decline as property and land was divided among the Yorba heirs. Destruction In 1917 and again in late 1919, Don Meadows and Roch Bradshaw, two local students, visited the ruins to measure, photograph and study the site. Don Meadows would later write a short account of their explorations, published as \\"The House of Bernardo Yorba\\" by the Orange County Historical Society. The Yorba family and the County Supervisors could not agree on the amount of land to be set aside for the preservation of the Yorba home. In 1926 the property's owner, Samuel Kraemer, demolished the building to prevent further vandalism, and plowed in a new barley field on the site. All the adobe ruins and the remaining trees were torn down and deposited into a barranca nearby. The Yorba cemetery closed in 1939 and thereafter vandals destroyed or stole many of the grave markers. Present day California Historical Landmark #226 as shown in June 1961. California Historical Landmark #226 The site of the hacienda is registered by the state as California Historical Landmark #226. A stone marker, placed by the California Centennials Commission and dedicated 3 May 1950, has a bronze plaque titled \\"Site of Don Bernardo Yorba Hacienda\\" which gives a brief summary of the historical background of the site. The marker faces south and is located on the northeast corner of Esperanza Road and Echo Hill Lane in Yorba Linda, at the entrance to the Fairmont Hill community. According to the plaque, the base was furnished by the Placentia Round Table Club and supposedly contains some of the original adobe bricks from the hacienda structure salvaged from the barranca where it was dumped. There are a few red bricks found on the backside, but most of the base seems to be made of large stones cemented together. The site marker is actually 55 yards northeast from the east wall of the original main structure. Based on survey reports registered with the county, the true site of this structure is parallel with the road in what is now the westbound fast lane of Esperanza road on the north side of the center divider, midway along the left turn lane opposite Echo Hill Lane. The Yorba Cemetery, now surrounded by Woodgate Park and Woodgate Condominium Association, is the only surviving part of the Yorba Hacienda. The cemetery was deeded to the county of Orange in 1967 and is presently (2010) administered by the county parks department. Restoration efforts are underway and tours are available.

He made an important contribution to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. Early life Stephen was born at Lambeth, the third son of James Stephen and brother to George Stephen (1794‚Äì1879). An attack of smallpox during James' infancy caused a permanent weakness of eyesight. He was under various schoolmasters, including John Prior Estlin and the Rev. Henry Jowett of Little Dunham, Norfolk. In 1806 he entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he learned as little as if he had passed the time \\"at the Clarendon Hotel in Bond Street.\\" He took the LL.B. degree in 1812, having been called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 11 November 1811. His father, who was just leaving the bar, transferred some practice to his son, who also began to make a digest of colonial laws. Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst, who was in sympathy with the \\"Clapham Sect,\\" allowed him to inspect official records for the digest, and in 1813 appointed him counsel to the Colonial Office. His duty was to report upon all acts of the colonial legislatures. The work increased, but he was also allowed to practice privately, and in a few years was making ¬£3,000 a year, and in a fair way to the honours of the profession. Colonial Office career On 22 December 1814 Stephen married Jane Catherine, who was the daughter of John Venn, rector of Clapham, one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society. In 1822 Stephen had a severe illness caused by exhaustion. He decided in 1825 to accept the offer of the post of permanent counsel to the Colonial Office and to the Board of Trade, abandoning his private practice. In 1834 Stephen was appointed assistant undersecretary of state for the colonies, and in 1836 under-secretary, giving up his position in the board of trade. The duties became onerous. He had a high reputation for his knowledge of constitutional law, and as an administrator. He gained influence with his superiors, and his colleague, Sir Henry Taylor, said that for many years he \\"literally ruled the colonial empire.\\" The impression of his influence gained him the nicknames of \\"King Stephen\\" and \\"Mr. Oversecretary Stephen\\". Stephen had accepted his position partly with a hope of influencing policy on the slavery question. When abolition became inevitable, he was called on to draw up the Slavery Abolition Act passed in 1833. Between the noons of Saturday and Monday he dictated an elaborate bill of sixty-six sections. He also was writing for the Edinburgh Review, and suffered a breakdown. In April 1837 one of the principal thoroughfares of Melbourne, Australia was named Stephen Street in his honour. In later years Stephen was involved in the establishment of government in Canada; and his views are said to have been more liberal than those of the government. Esteemed by his official superiors, he used formality to keep others at a distance. The health of his youngest son induced him in 1840 to take a house at Brighton for his family, to which he could make only weekly visits. From 1842 to 1846 he lived at Windsor, in order to send his sons to Eton College. In 1846 he was summoned to Dresden by the illness of his eldest son, who died before his parents could reach him. In 1847 he resigned his post. He was made a K.C.B. and a Privy Councillor. Teaching and writing Stephen had meanwhile become known as a writer by a series of articles in the Edinburgh Review, the first of which (on William Wilberforce) appeared in April 1838. They were written in the intervals of his official work, generally in the early morning. He carefully disavowed any pretence to profound research. The articles had, however, shown considerable historical knowledge as well as literary power. He had partly recovered strength, and was anxious for employment. In June 1849 Stephen was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge, a chair vacant by the death of William Smyth. He delivered a course of lectures on the history of France during the summers of 1850 and 1851, which were published in 1852, and praised by De Tocqueville. Another severe illness in the summer of 1850 had forced him to spend a winter abroad. From 1855 to 1857 he held a professorship at the East India Company College, Haileybury, which had been sentenced to extinction. He continued to lecture at Cambridge, but the history school then had little prestige. Keynes asserts in his biography of Malthus that Sir James Stephen was \\"the last holder\\" of Malthus's chair at Haileybury, which Malthus had held for thirty years until his death in 1834. Leslie Stephen \\"used to think nothing\\" of walking from Cambridge to visit his father at Haileybury. Retirement and death Monument, Kensal Green Cemetery Monument detail, Kensal Green Cemetery Stephen passed the last years of his life mainly in London. In 1859 his health showed serious symptoms, and he was ordered to Bad Homburg, Prussia. Becoming worse, he started homewards, but died at Koblenz, Prussia on 14 September 1859. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. His widow died in 1875.

Between the December 1996-August 1997, he was state secretary, chief of Government's Department (GCD), within the government of Victor Ciorbea. The investigations he coordinated in this position uncovered several irregularities of some high officials affiliated to the governmental coalition (the questionable selling of part of the navy's property, dossier Flota-Fleet (http://www.valerianstan.ro/admin/spaw/uploads/files/2%20dosarul%20Flota- site.pdf) \\"Petroklav\\"/Traian Basescu and others), the occupancy or the illegal appropriation of several residences from the state's special locative fund etc.) This fact finally led to his dismissal from the position ‚Äì a decision that later was considered as a mistake by the Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea and Minister Traian Basescu. In the years to come, this measure has had serious consequences in the fight against corruption in Romania.

The steam boilers and machinery for the ironclad were built in DeLamater's foundry during the Civil War.A Well Spent Life; Incidents in the Record of Cornelius H. DeLamater. The New York Times. Feb 10, 1889. Swedish marine engineer and inventor John Ericsson considered DeLamater his closest, most intimate friend. Life Cornelius H. DeLamater was born on August 30, 1821, in Rhinebeck, New York, his family moving to New York City when Cornelius was three years old. His father was hired by a very small iron foundry, the Phoenix Iron Works of James Cunningham on West Street, as cashier and confidential advisor. At 16, Cornelius entered the Phoenix Foundry, and at age 20, upon the death of Cunningham, he formed a co-partnership with Peter Hogg under the name Hogg and DeLamater. This firm continued from 1842 to 1857, when Hogg retired from the business. The firm was re-formed as the DeLamater Iron Works, and moved to the foot of West 13th Street on the West side of Manhattan. At an early age, DeLamater developed an unusual ability in solving problems that were then developing in regard to steam engineering and machinery. During the Civil War he worked with Capt. John Ericsson in the development of the ironclads and , which were constructed in an incredibly short space of time. In time, the DeLamater Iron Works became known as the asylum where inventors and capitalists could go to experiment and attempt new feats. The Iron Witch was next constructed, the first iron steamboat. The hot air engine of Capt. Ericsson was first introduced in the ship Ericsson, which was built entirely by DeLamater. The DeLamater Iron Works was also the place where the first submarine boat, first self-propelled torpedo, first torpedo boat, and the engines for the original Monitor were built.Honors for Capt Ericsson\\".

The DeLamater Estate included everything beyond what is today #325 Asharoken Avenue. This includes the upper half of Asharoken Beach, the Morgan Estate, the Eaton Harbors or Two Acre Zone of Eaton's Neck, and the Bevin Road peninsula in Asharoken. The DeLamater Mansion still stands today on the Eatons Neck peninsula, and was rented in 1942 by French author Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry who wrote The Little Prince while at the mansion. The children and grandchildren of DeLamater also built mansions over time in Eaton's Neck and Asharoken that still stand today, namely \\"The Point\\", \\"The Nest\\", \\"The Crest\\", and \\"The Hill\\". The DeLamaters also renovated two existing colonial structures for family estates, namely \\"Cherry Lawn\\" and \\"Oak Leaf\\".

Washoe County spent the first three quarters of 1965 making shuttle trips between Okinawa, Japan, and Vietnam in support of American forces in Vietnam. The loads she carried during the year included Marine Corps, Naval Beach Group, Naval Beach Jumper, and Amphibious Construction Battalion equipment and personnel. Most of the year's last quarter was devoted to a yard overhaul at Yokosuka which began on 16 September 1965 and ended on 10 December 1965. On 27 December 1965, the ship commenced refresher training which continued into 1966. The ship departed Yokosuka loaded with pontoon barge sections destined for Danang, South Vietnam. Following a short stop in Okinawa, the ship arrived at Danang on 22 February 1966. She then proceeded to Chu Lai and discharged the remainder of the cargo. After hauling cargo to Danang, Chu Lai, Camranh Bay, and Phan Rang, Washoe County joined with an amphibious ready group whose mission was to conduct an amphibious raid, Operation Jackstay against Viet Cong southeast of Saigon. She served in a pioneering role as an advance base providing gunfire support, arms, ammunition, rations, and water to assault boat groups. Washoe County returned to Yokosuka on 28 May 1966 for a brief period of repairs and rehabilitation. On 18 June 1966, the ship sailed for Okinawa to reload supplies, then made a visit to Hong Kong before resuming her duties as a cargo carrier along the Vietnamese coast. In mid-August, she steamed through the Inland Sea of Japan and Shimonoseki Strait on her way to Korea. After a week of training with the Republic of Korea Navy, Washoe County returned to Iwakuni, Japan, and embarked Marines and cargo. Before returning to Yokosuka at the end of October 1966, the ship made two more lifts to Vietnam, carrying cargo to Chu Lai and Qui Nhon and returning equipment from Danang to Naha, Okinawa. The year 1967 began with Washoe County in the port of Naha, Okinawa, loading cargo. She spent the month of January engaged in shuttle runs carrying cargo and personnel along the South Vietnamese coast and Okinawa and then enjoyed a rest and recreation visit to Hong Kong. The ship spent most of February 1967 conducting intracoastal logistic support lifts along the South Vietnam coast. On 20 February 1967, Washoe County participated in Operation De Soto, in which material was offloaded by Marine helicopters operating off the ship's main deck. The operation was concluded on 8 March 1967, and the tank landing ship underwent an upkeep period lasting from 20 March 1967 to 11 April 1967. From 15 April 1967 to 2 June 1967, Washoe County made shuttle runs with cargo and troops to Chi Lung, Taiwan; Danang and Chu Lai, South Vietnam; Naha, Okinawa; Yokosuka, Japan; and Inchon, South Korea. The ship then returned to Yokosuka for upkeep from 7 June 1967 to 22 June 1967, during which time Washoe County became the flagship for Landing Squadron 9. The crew enjoyed liberty at Hong Kong from 11 July 1967 to 16 July 1967; then debarked the commodore and his staff at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, and took Army personnel to Pusan, Korea, before returning to Yokosuka on 3 August 1967 for upkeep which was completed on 7 September 1967. In mid-September, the ship arrived at Danang and participated in three major Operation Fortress Sentry, Operation Formation Leader, and Operation Badger Hunt, from 14 September 1967 to 2 December 1967. Washoe County retired to Subic Bay on 5 December 1967 and soon sailed to Okinawa for training exercises with Marines. She returned to Yokosuka on 18 December 1967 for upkeep which lasted into 1968. On 1 March 1968, Washoe County sailed for Danang, South Vietnam, in company with USS Terrell County (LST-1157) and USS Westchester County (LST-1167), carrying causeway sections to be used at Wunder Beach, South Vietnam. The sections were splashed and moved into place on 17 March 1968. While engaged in the causeway installation, Washoe Countys port shaft was damaged; and she underwent repairs at Subic Bay from 21 March 1968 to 25 March 1968. She then returned to Vietnam, but further problems with the port shaft developed, necessitating more extensive repairs at Subic Bay which lasted until 29 April 1968. The ship then successfully completed sea trials and got underway for Japan and arrived at Yokosuka on 5 May 1968. Washoe County underwent upkeep at Yokosuka which was not finished until early June 1968. On 3 June 1968, she began loading Marine equipment at Naha, and she delivered it at Subic Bay on 8 June 1968.

En route on 20 June 1968, Washoe County embarked two injured personnel from the American freighter SS John C. after that ship had run aground on the north reef of the Paracel Islands. The next day, Washoe County returned to Danang and resumed duties with the amphibious ready group. With the exception of upkeep from 10 July 1968 to 20 July 1968, the ship served in the combat zone continuously through July and much of August. On 24 August 1968, Washoe County headed for her home port and arrived at Yokosuka on 12 September 1968. Washoe County began her last deployment of 1968 off the coast of South Vietnam at the Ca Mau Peninsula for Operation Market Time, sealing off the coastline of South Vietnam and adjacent waterways from communist infiltration. From 27 October 1968 to 9 December 1968, she functioned as an emergency helicopter landing pad in evacuating eight U.S. Navy and United States Coast Guard personnel wounded in action and the body of one Coast Guardsman who had been killed in action ashore. She also dispensed fuel, food, water, and ammunition to 134 patrol boats and fired 42 naval gunfire support missions. Washoe County arrived back at Yokosuka on 19 December 1968 and spent the end of 1968 there. Washoe County began 1969 preparing for the cyclical yard overhaul period which commenced on 19 January 1969 and continued through 10 April 1969. From 20 April 1969 to 6 June 1969, she conducted refresher training and amphibious refresher training. On 12 June 1969, Washoe County got underway for the first deployment of the year as a support ship for Operation Seafloat/Tran Hung Dao III in the Ca Mau Peninsula of South Vietnam. Seafloat was a floating advanced tactical support base primarily for psychological warfare missions conducted in the Cua Lon River at the southernmost tip of South Vietnam. During this period, Washoe County served as a helicopter platform and provided logistics and communications support. On 10 August 1969, after 46 days on station, Washoe County sailed via Subic Bay to Hong Kong for a two-week assignment as station ship. She got underway on 4 September 1969 for Yokosuka but was diverted by a trip from Okinawa to Danang and finally arrived at her home port on 23 September 1969. She remained there until 9 October 1969 when she transported a detachment of Marines and equipment from Okinawa to Numazu, Japan. Departing Japan on 28 October 1969, Washoe County participated in Operation Keystone Cardinal, a major troop redeployment lift from Vietnam. During November, Washoe County steamed more than 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 kilometers) bringing troops and equipment from Vietnam to Okinawa before returning to Yokosuka on 3 December 1969 for annual inspections and the Christmas holiday season. Washoe County took station as a Seafloat support vessel from 20 January 1970 to 12 March 1970 and again from 17 May 1970 to 2 August 1970. Between these two deployments, Washoe County served as station ship in Hong Kong from 18 March 1970 to 27 March 1970. On 12 August 1970, Washoe County arrived at Osaka, Japan, to enjoy four days at the World's Fair, Expo 70. From 19 August 1970 to 19 September 1970, she underwent upkeep at Yokosuka and then made a visit to Hong Kong. After stopping at Chu Lai, Vietnam, and Subic Bay, the Philippines, to load cargo on board, Washoe County headed for the California coast, via Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Diego on 10 November 1970. She offloaded Marine cargo at Camp Pendleton on 13 November 1970, then made a port visit to San Francisco. Washoe County earned a Presidential Unit Citation, a Navy Unit Commendation, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and twelve campaign stars for Vietnam War service.

Military Sealift Command service Washoe County was reactivated in January 1973 to serve as a cargo ship in a non-commissioned status with a civil service crew with the Military Sealift Command in January 1973, being designated the United States Naval Ship USNS Washoe County (T-LST-1165). This service continued until she was stricken from the Navy List on 1 November 1973. At that time, she was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, Benicia, California. The Washoe County was converted to civilian manning at Todd Shipyard in Long Beach, California during the summer of 1972 and was manned on 12 October by her civil service crew. Her Master was Captain Howard I. Gyle, First Officer Frank A. Rogers, 2nd Mate Ned Williams and 3rd Mate Wesley D. Monts. The Radio Officer was Joseph A.

Time Warp captured common everyday events and viewed them again in slow motion to uncover the many principles of physics. To do so, they examined things such as a drop of water, explosions (many of them), gunshots, ballet dancing, cornflour, shallow water diving, X games and sometimes some uncanny things like piercing one's cheek or standing on blades. The high speed cameras were used at as low as 500 frame/second for capturing how dogs drink to as high as 40,000 frame/second for capturing bullets, breaking glass, etc. Speeds above 20,000 frame/second were shot in black and white as the amount of light needed to record in black and white is significantly lower than what's needed to record in color.

The main component of Larchill Demesne, it was created in the mid-18th century, and restored in the mid-1990s. It lies in the townland of Phepotstown near Kilcock, County Kildare, Ireland. History The gardens were formed in the late 18th and early 19th century, by Mr. Robert and Mrs. Watson. A family named de Las Casas bought Larchill in 1994. By then, many of the follies were semi-derelict, the lake had been drained and the walled garden was being used for grazing. They secured a grant for restoration from the 'Great Gardens of Ireland Programme' and, helped by a FAS Community Employment Scheme, the restoration project was carried out between 1994 and 1999, winning a number of awards. Features =Layout= The farm and garden form a rough rectangle, with scenic parkland walks, including beech avenues, linking key features. The walled garden and farmyard are situated at the north end, and a substantial lake at the south end. =Walled garden and farmyard= Restored to a traditional 18th century formal design in the 1990s, the walled garden has multiple beds, including herb and vegetable sections, borders of perennial planting, box hedges, and water features. A feature of the walled garden is the 'Cockle Tower', a circular castellated construction on three-levels in the south west corner. Commenced in 1820, it has rough limestone rubble walls, and an entrance on the first level above ground, reached by steps. Both doorway and windows have pointed arches. The interior was decorated with shells, of which some remain. There is a local legend that Mrs. Watson was buried there, until later owners had her remains moved to a churchyard. Also attached to the walls is an ornamental dairy, on the southern elevation. Begun around 1810, it has an arcade, with columns, arched openings and stained glass windows, and a shell fountain. The Gothic-style farmyard, in the form of two courtyards to north of the main house, has dovecotes, stable ranges and pigsties. The buildings have slate roofs, limestone dressings, and timed-framed and diamond-paned windows. =Lake= The ornamental lake has an area of around , with two islands, each featuring a folly, and a statue of Bacchus between them. There is also an ornamental Gothic boathouse dug into the side of the lake, with a single-arch to the lake, and a wrought-iron gate to the rear. By the lake are water and flower meadows. Fauna include frogs, dragonflies, wild duck and swans. There is a Chinese prayer lantern to the south of the lake, with a Chinoiserie bridge, in place of what used to be a bridge to the Temple Island. =Follies= * The Fox's Earth, an ornamented mausoleum mound, built by Mr. Watson because he believed he would be punished for excessive fox-hunting by being reincarnated as a fox, and would need a refuge. The \\"Earth\\" is a three- bay one-storey fa√ßade set on an artificial hillock, with a small 6-pillar rustic temple on top. Pointed arch openings to three-bay fa√ßade. A rubble stone bridge leads to the site. * Rustic Temple (woodland), commenced between 1800 and 1820, with six rendered columns in a hexagonal plan, stone seats, and a rubble stone dome. The temple is flanked by rendered walls with circular terminating piers. * Temple Island with Lake Temple, whose roof sloped inwards to gather rainwater in a plunge pool * \\"Gibraltar\\" is a miniature triangular fortress, based on Mr. Watson's memories of the Rock of Gibraltar, started around 1820. It has corner towers and turrets, rendered walls with castellations, and openings with pointed arches and gun loops. Mock naval battles were fought on the lake in past centuries. =Other features= There is an 18th-century \\"sheep run\\" and at the north end of the western walk are a 19th-century Chinese prayer lamp and statue. There is also an eel pond, and an \\"eel house\\", a tower in which to catch eels. When the lake was dug in the 18th century, the soil from the excavation was used to form a \\"feuill√©\\", a circular mound with a decorative spiral of beech trees on top. Farm animals Rare breeds of animal were used in the 18th and 19th century in such gardens, and today various breeds of cattle and sheep, along with llamas and emus, graze the parkland, while pigs, goats and fowl can be found in the farmyard. Facilities There is parking for cars and coaches and a picnic area. The gardens open May to June, and for a few days in September-October, and an admission fee is charged. The former general tea room in a converted barn, which also included a gift shop, operates only for groups.

Tinsley, a Capitan rancher and the owner of the K-Bob's Steakhouse restaurant chain. Although the 2nd has historically been the most conservative district in New Mexico, polls showed the race to be very competitive. Ultimately, Teague won in the general election with 56 percent of the vote to Tinsley's 44 percent. He received strong support from the western side of the district, as well as from its large Latino population. Teague and the Democratic Party outspent Tinsley and the Republican Party by over $3 million in the 2008 campaign.

History 25th Street in Ogden The history of 25th Street began with the opening of Union Station, at the west end of the street, during the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Later, another rail line, the Utah Northern Railroad, was built between Franklin, Idaho and Ogden. The Ogden Union Station Depot became the hub for the Utah Northern Railroad, and served as a major railroad junction. The original structure of the Union Station Depot was destroyed by a fire in 1923. During the early 20th century, 25th Street was a center of activity in Ogden.

Named after its original owner, Jos√© Justo Liendo, the plantation was purchased in 1873 by sculptor Elisabet Ney and her husband, physician Edmund Montgomery. The plantation is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The land that is now Liendo Plantation was granted to Jos√© Justo Liendo in 1828, when the region was a part of Mexico. In 1841 the plot was purchased by Leonard Waller Groce, who made the land into a working cotton plantation, adding a plantation home to the site in 1853. During the American Civil War, the facility was turned to Confederate military use as \\"Camp Groce,\\" used first as a training camp and then as a military prison. The Civil War and aftermath 1861-1862 The Confederate Military Post of Hempstead was established in the Spring of 1861. Numerous camps of instruction were established east of town along Clear Creek. Camp Hebert was established on the eastern bank of Clear Creek and south of the Washington Road. Camp Hebert was the earliest camp in the area, and served as the headquarters of the Post of Hempstead early in the war. Camp Groce CSA was established in spring 1862 on Liendo Plantation on the eastern bank of Clear Creek as a camp of instruction for Confederate infantry recruits. Originally named Camp Liendo, the name was changed to Camp Groce in honor of Leonard Waller Groce, the owner of Liendo Plantation[6], and the owner of over 100 slaves. A contract to construct the barracks at Camps Groce and Hebert was let in February 1862. Numerous Confederate infantry regiments were organized, trained, and equipped at Camps Groce and Hebert. In spring 1862, the camps were abandoned due to their sickly locations. Camp Groce was reused as a military camp until spring 1863, but was again abandoned. From 1861 to 1863, nearly 200 Confederate soldiers fell sick at Camps Groce and Hebert and died. Many were taken to the Post Hospital in the Planter's Exchange Hotel located at the southwest corner of 12th and Wilkins Streets in downtown Hempstead. Many died in the hospital and almost all of them are buried on McDade Plantation west of town, which became the hospital cemetery. 1863 In June 1863, Camp Groce was re-opened as a prison camp for Union prisoners captured in the Battles of Galveston (January 1, 1863) and Sabine Pass I (January 21, 1863). The Union prisoners of war taken at the Battle of Sabine Pass II (September 8, 1863) were also sent to Camp Groce. 427 Union prisoners were held at Camp Groce in 1863 and 21 died. Most of the dead were buried northeast of camp where most of them still rest today. 1864 Camp Groce was re-opened in May 1864 for 148 Union prisoners captured at the battle of Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana. The group of prisoners included the crew of the USS Granite City and USS Wave, Tinclad #45, and 37 soldiers. About 40 soldiers from the 1st Texas US Cavalry were sent to Camp Groce in June 1864, and 506 more Union prisoners were transferred to Camp Groce from Camp Ford in August 1864. Yellow fever and other diseases affected the prisoners. They were moved to Camp Gillespie near Bellville in late September 1864 and then to Camp Felder, 6.5 miles north-northwest of Chappell Hill, Texas. 221 prisoners died or were missing from Camps Groce, Gillespie, and Felder in 1864. 444 were paroled in December 1864. 1863: 427 POWs, 21 died, 2 escaped 1864: 683 POWs, 147 died, 28 missing, 18 escaped, 13 deserted to the enemy, 14 status unknown, and 1 political prisoner held by CS authorities until released in May 1865. Totals: 1,110 POWs held, 168 died, 28 missing, 20 escaped, 13 deserted to the enemy, 14 status unknown At least 277 Confederate soldiers died or went missing in and around Hempstead, Texas during the Civil War. Most of the US and CS soldiers who died in and around Hempstead, Texas during the Civil War are still buried in the area. They are buried in 3 primary locations in and around Camp Groce and west of town on the old McDade Plantation Cemetery on Austin Branch Road near Sorsby Road. There is a Texas State Historical Marker there entitled \\"Union Army POW Cemetery,\\" but there are also numerous US Navy POWs buried there along with numerous Confederate soldiers who died in the hospitals in downtown Hempstead. Recently, a Waller County Historical Marker was placed within the boundaries of Camp Groce. It is located on the east side of FM 359 just south of Clear Creek. Entitled \\"Camp Groce Cemetery,\\" the marker commemorates the deaths and burial location of US prisoners of war and Confederate soldiers who died and were buried within the boundaries of Camp Groce. Also, the Washington County Historical Commission has placed a Texas State Historical Marker entitled, \\"Camp Felder\\" on the west side of FM 1155 north of Chappell Hill, Texas to commemorate Camp Felder CSA. 1865 About 8,000 Confederate soldiers from Walker's Division (commanded by Maj. Gen. John H. Forney) were ordered to Hempstead from Louisiana in March 1865. Upon the arrival of the division on March 24‚Äì30, 1865, the division began waiting for Confederate President Jefferson Davis to arrive to make the Last Stand of the Confederacy at Hempstead, Texas. Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865, Johnston surrendered on April 26, 1865, and Davis was captured in Georgia on May 10, 1865 all of which compelled Confederate Maj. Gen. Kirby Smith to surrender the Department of the Trans-Mississippi on June 2, 1865. All Confederate forces in Hempstead and all other CS posts in Texas mostly went home. Immediately after the surrender of CS forces in Texas, it took about a month before US troops entered the state. The first US forces to arrive in Hempstead after the war was the 29th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The 29th was relieved by the 37th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment that garrisoned the US Post of Hempstead, Texas well into 1866. In August 1865, Maj. Gen. George A. Custer arrived in Hempstead with a division of volunteer US cavalry. The division camped in and around Liendo Plantation for about two months before moving to Austin or were mustered out of the service at Hempstead in 1865-66. The cavalry regiments under the command of Custer at Hempstead were the 1st Iowa, 2nd Wisconsin, 7th Indiana, and the 5th and 12th Illinois Cavalry. Company K of the 37th Illinois Volunteer Infantry occupied the town and guarded the railroad line until the regiment was mustered out in May 1866. The headquarters of US Post of Hempstead was located in town and not at Liendo Plantation. US Forces fanned out and set up camps in numerous towns. Their mission was to parole former Confederate troops, collect CS property, and to establish law and order. Many former CS troops did not report for their paroles, however, and many went to Mexico. The volunteer US regiments stationed in Texas were nearly gone from the state by the end of 1865. 1866-1869 In 1866, the 1st Battalion, Companies A and B of the 17th US Infantry, was stationed at Hempstead. The battalion arrived for duty in Hempstead in the Fall of 1866. They set up camp north of the US Post Office in downtown Hempstead. Their mission was primarily in support of the Freedmen's Bureau. In the Fall of 1867, a yellow fever epidemic devastated the civilian population of Hempstead, and nearly 40 soldiers of the 17th US Infantry died as well. On March 4, 1873, the plantation and home were purchased by German American sculptor Elisabet Ney and Scottish American physician and scientist Edmund Montgomery, a married couple moving to Texas from Georgia. Ney and Montgomery occupied the plantation from 1873 through Montgomery's death in 1911, though from 1892 Ney largely removed to Austin, Texas. Both are buried on the grounds. The plantation home was given a state historical marker in 1936, and the entire plantation was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1964. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 21, 1971.

However there was no banning from the first winner, Nadia who was congratulated by the host, Adal Ramones. But the controversy came when Yahir won Breakthrough of the Year because he thanked TV Azteca in a live show transmitted in Televisa Network. =Ang√©lica Rivera= Some prominent media figures disagreed with the presentation of an award to Ang√©lica Rivera because they said she was an actress, not a singer and the other nominees had more seniority in the music field. They contended that the award was given to her primarily because the show was on Televisa and her telenovela was very successful at the time.

The following season it was sold with a 2¬Ω-litre 20 hp engine under the name Rover Light Twenty.  Overview  Announced in October 1929 the Rover Light Six was one of the Rover cars manufactured when Spencer and Maurice Wilks, who joined Rover's team in 1929 and 1930, introduced new management practices and engineering techniques to Rover. Engine The Light Six was powered by a watercooled 2 L straight-6 OHV engine with an output of 45 bhp at 3600 rpm designed by Peter Poppe, which provided the Two-litre saloon a maximum speed of 60 mph (97 km/h). The bore of 65 mm put the engine into the 16 hp taxation class. The car was supplied with a three-speed gearbox controlled by a lever in the centre of the car. The lever was flexible, operated in a gate and had a stop to avoid engaging reverse. The engine clutch and gearbox assembly was mounted and supported at three points, the single one in front, the rear pair by horizontally U-shaped leaf spring attachments.The Motor Show. The Times, Tuesday, Oct 18, 1927; pg. 10; Issue 44715 Brakes suspension steering The suspension was conventional for the time with half elliptic leaf springs all round mounted above the axles. The pedal brakes worked shoes in enclosed drums on all four wheels by rods but the handbrake used those on the back wheels and operated them by chain. There are shock absorbers fore and aft. Body The body was very light weight rattle free fabric bodywork built by Rover under licence from Weymann. For the driver's comfort the clutch pedal is adjustable for travel and the front seat can be adjusted over a range of six inches using wing nuts in the cushion. Publicity The Rover Light Six won attention when it was the first successful participant in the Blue Train Races, a series of record- breaking attempts between automobiles and trains in the late 1920s and early 1930s. It saw a number of motorists and their own or sponsored automobiles race against the Le Train Bleu, a train that ran between Calais and the French Riviera. Please note that TM6124, car/chassis number 430 pictured above is not the actual race car. The car used was an early press demonstrator that Rover retained for development purposes. On the 27 January 1930 the Rover's third and successful attempt started from St Raphael on the Riviera and ended at Calais 20 hours later, averaging 38 mph over 750 miles. The little Rover beat the Blue Train by 20 minutes. Road test Tested by Autocar in late 1929 the car seemed capable of a 70 mph top speed though weather conditions prohibited a formal measurement. The engine's smoothness was fine except under load at speeds below 20 mph in top gear. The car seemed geared for speed and not fuel economy. The single wiper was mounted at the foot of the windscreen to provide the widest possible view. The steering column was nearer horizontal than usual. Roadholding was fair but springing when with two persons aboard needs further adjustment of the shock absorbers. The style of the body is original and to many people attractive.Light Six Rover sportsman's saloon, Autocar, 27 December 1929 External links *Light Six on the road * Light Six 21st century *interior of Gaydon's car References Light Six Category:Vehicles introduced in 1927 ","title":"Rover Light Six"},{"id":"20090588","text":"Giancarlo Carmona Maldonado (born 12 October 1985) is a Peruvian footballer who plays as a centre-back.

Born into a well-known noble judicial family, de Barentin was Advocate General of the Parlement of Paris (1757 to 1775), president of the Cour des Aides (1775 to 1788) and became Keeper of the Seals on 14 September 1788, which post he held until 15 July 1789. Four days earlier, on the advice of his privy council, the king had dismissed his populist Director-General of Finances, Jacques Necker. The public outcry led to the storming of the Bastille three days later, and Louis was forced to recall Necker. The king held de Barentin responsible and sacked him. In November of the same year he was accused by a revolutionary court of conspiring to order troops to fire on the crowd storming the Bastille, but was acquitted, and emigrated to Italy and then England, where he remained until the restoration of the monarchy.

He continued his good form in the 2006-07 Ranji One-day Trophy by scoring 277 runs in 7 matches at an average of 39.57 and a high-score of 112. Vijay played in all seven matches of Tamil Nadu in the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy and scored 582 runs at an average of 58.2 with two hundreds including a high-score of 230* against Saurashtra. After the conclusion of Ranji Trophy, he was selected in the South Zone squad for 2007-08 Duleep Trophy. He batted at 3 in the first match against North Zone and scored a duck and 39. In the second game against East Zone, batting at 3 in the first innings, he scored 46, and registered another duck in the second innings while opening the batting. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy (earlier called Ranji One-day Trophy) that followed, Vijay played seven matches in which he opened the innings thrice and batted at 3 on four occasions. He found success batting at 3, making back-to-back hundreds against Hyderabad and Andhra. In September 2008, Vijay was picked in the India A team to play against the touring New Zealand A team in two 4-day matches. He carried on his good form and made 45 and 59 in the first match, batting at 3, helping India A win by 129 runs. He opened the innings and scored 98 and 0 in the second match, in which New Zealand A secured victory. In October 2008, Vijay was named in the India Red team for the Challenger Trophy. He played as an opener and finished second among highest run-scorers of the tournament with 164 runs from 3 matches at an average of 54.66. Test career Vijay made his Test debut against Australia in the Fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, in Nagpur, in November 2008. He was selected for the match after Gautam Gambhir received a one-Test ban for elbowing Shane Watson in the Third Test of the same series in Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi. Vijay was participating in a Ranji trophy match at the time, and made his Test debut on the final day of that match. Of Vijay's technique, former Australian captain Allan Border said \\"His defensive shots are so assured. And he looks comfortable of both front and back foot. And when he attacks, he doesn't go hard at the deliveries. I can see why this young man is playing\\". Vijay partnered Virender Sehwag, and they got India off to a solid start in both innings. Vijay made 33 and 41, contributing to opening stands of 98 and 116. During Australia's first innings, Vijay caused the first wicket to fall, running out Matthew Hayden with a direct hit from mid on. Hayden was attempting a quick single. He then ran out Michael Hussey when fielding at silly point. Hussey was unaware that Vijay had intercepted the ball at close range and instinctively took a step out of his crease in anticipation of a run, by which time Vijay threw down the stumps. In the second innings, he caught Brett Lee at bat pad from the bowling of Harbhajan Singh to complete his first catch. Following his performance in his debut Test, Vijay was selected for the Indian ODI squad for the first three matches against the touring England team. He did not get to play, and was dropped after the first three matches upon the return of senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar from a break. In December 2009, Vijay was given another opportunity in the Test team when Gambhir withdrew from the Third and final Test against Sri Lanka at Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai in order to attend his sister's wedding. Vijay took two catches at bat pad from Harbhajan in Sri Lanka's first innings. When India replied, he put on 221 for the first wicket with Sehwag, but was out for 87 in sight of his maiden Test century. The Indians went on to complete an innings victory, and become the number 1 Test team.3rd Test: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai (BS), Dec 2-6, 2009  Cricket Scorecard  ESPN Cricinfo. Cricinfo.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-23. Vijay was taken on the tour of Bangladesh in January 2010 as the reserve batsman, and he was called into the team after V. V. S. Laxman injured a finger in the First Test. Vijay played in the Second Test in Mirpur in Laxman's No. 5 position, scoring 30. In the same match, No. 3 batsman Rahul Dravid was injured after being hit under the jaw by a bouncer, so Vijay then played in Dravid's position in the two-Test home series against South Africa. He was later selected as the reserve opener for away series against Sri Lanka in August 2010 and the home series against Australia in October 2010. He played in the Second and Third Tests against Sri Lanka after Gambhir was injured. He got another opportunity when Gambhir, was injured in the first match against Australia and was ruled out of Second Test. Vijay scored 139 runs in the first innings, his maiden Test century, featuring in a triple century partnership with Sachin Tendulkar. Vijay and debutant Cheteshwar Pujara added 72 runs crucial partnership which helped India complete a 2‚Äì0 series win. Though he was dropped from the national squad, however he was brought back in the 2013 home series against Australia replacing out-of-form Gautam Gambhir. Though Vijay failed in the first test, he scored an assured and well paced 167 in the second Test and put on a 370-run record second wicket partnership with Cheteshwar Pujara (204). In the third test at Mohali, he scored his second consecutive 150+ score (153) with a strong opening stand of 289 with debutant Shikhar Dhawan, who scored a whopping 187 off just 174 balls. And then added on 92 runs for the third wicket with Sachin Tendulkar (37). He had an amazing series against Australia and was the highest scorer with 430 runs including two centuries both which were 150+ and an amazing half century. Vijay made his first Test century outside India on 10 July 2014 at Trent Bridge against England when he scored 146. He also made a gutsy half-century in the next innings of the same match. He missed out on consecutive hundred in next match of the same series at the historic Lord's when he was caught behind off James Anderson on 95. His patient 95 proved to be the vital cog in India's one of the greatest test wins abroad. India lost all of the next three tests against England to lose the series 1‚Äì3. Vijay finished as the leading run scorer for India in that series with 402 runs from 5 matches. When India toured Australia later in the same year, Vijay scored a patient and a steady 99 at the Adelaide Oval putting up a partnership of 185 with his skipper Virat Kohli to almost take India to an improbable victory, chasing 364 in the fourth innings. His dismissal triggered the batting collapse and India lost the test by a close margin. Vijay was at his fluent best in the second test at the Gabba, Brisbane. He scored 144 at a brisk pace to take India to a position of strength on the first day. This equaled the highest score by an Indian at the ground. He scored his sixth Test hundred in the one-match Test series against Bangladesh in June 2015. ODI career Vijay debuted in ODIs against South Africa in the third and final one dayer on 27 Feb 2010. He scored a brisk 25 runs off 16 balls.Batting records  One-Day Internationals  Cricinfo Statsguru  ESPN Cricinfo. Stats.cricinfo.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-23. He started a full series during a tri-nations tournament in Zimbabwe when India rested most of the first-choice team. Vijay performed poorly and was dropped for India's fourth match as they came last behind Zimbabwe. Vijay was selected for New Zealand 5 ODI series 2010 and he played first 3 ODI in which he scored an average of 30. Later, he was replaced by wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel for other 2 ODI matches. International T20 career Vijay was selected for 2010 ICC World Twenty20. He fared poorly in India's disastrous campaign averaging just below 15 and failing to provide good starts in all the matches. IPL career Vijay played for IPL franchise from his home town Chennai Super Kings till the sixth edition and represented Delhi Daredevils in IPL7. He was one of the key performers for Chennai in the 3rd edition of IPL in 2010 when Chennai were crowned champions. His first century for Chennai Super Kings was in the third season where he scored 127 runs off 56 balls against the Rajasthan Royals. He was awarded the Man of the Match. In the same year, Vijay had prolific run in the Champions League T20 held in South Africa. Vijay was the top scorer of the tournament with 294 runs. He was instrumental in Chennai winning the cup. In the fourth season of IPL, he was retained by the Chennai Super Kings. Later he was awarded the man of the match in finals and helped Chennai Super Kings to win the IPL trophy for the second time in a row. He scored 95 off 52 balls with 4 fours and 6 sixes with a blistering strike rate of 183. In the beginning of IPL 2012, Vijay struggled to return to form. His first few matches was a disaster for Chennai, as he was out of form yet he was the opening batsmen for Chennai Super Kings. But he had his luck returned to him when he scored 113 off just 59 balls. With the century he became the only Indian cricketer to have scored two centuries in the history of Indian Premier League. With massive buys of Brendon McCullum and Dwayne Smith in the IPL 2014 the Chennai Super Kings released Vijay. In the IPL 2014 Auction held in February, he was sold to Delhi Daredevils for Rs 5 Crores. In April 2016, Vijay was named captain of Kings XI Punjab replacing South African David Miller in middle of the season. He missed out the entire 2017 season due to a wrist surgery. Personal life Murali Vijay is married to Nikita Vanjara They have three children, two sons and one daughter.

The rivers also were of primary importance in the process of Russian exploration and colonization of vast Siberian territories. Since the three great Siberian rivers, Ob River, Yenisei River and Lena River all flow into the Arctic Ocean, the problem was to find parts or branches of these rivers that flow approximately east-west and find short portages between them. Since Siberia is relatively flat, portages were usually short. Because of this, and the weakness of the Siberian tribes, Russian Cossacks were able to expand from the Urals to the Pacific in only 57 years (1582-1639). Southern Route Distances are straight lines and only approximate. Siberian rivers can be very crooked. Dates usually refer to the foundation of the first Russian settlement. Over the Urals: From the Volga River, up the Kama to Perm (1472), then up the Chusovaya River, or the Vishera (see Cherdyn Route). The Urals here are only about 350 meters high, about 150 meters above the surrounding lowlands. Down either the Tavda River or Tura River and a short way up the Tobol River to its juncture with the Irtysh River at Tobolsk (1582). This was the approximate route used by Yermak. Tobolsk is about 700 km east of Perm and 1800 km east of Moscow. The Babinov Road was the first overland path across the Urals. It was established by Artemy Babinov in the late 1590s. In 1598 Verkhoturye was founded along this road as the gateway to Siberia. The Siberian Route, a road begun in the 1730s, ran southeast from Perm to Kungur, then over another low pass to Yekaterinburg (1723) and Tobolsk. By 1885 there was a railway from Perm to Yekaterinburg. Another branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway (1891) goes south of the Urals through Chelyabinsk (1736), Omsk (1716) and Novosibirsk (1893). 600px Ob Basin: Near Tobolsk was the capital of the Khanate of Sibir, which was conquered in 1582. North down the Irtysh to its juncture with the Ob River, then 750km up the Ob to Narym (1594), and up the Ket River (1602) about 300 km to its headwaters. Here a portage leads to the Yenisei River at Yeniseysk (1619). Yeniseysk is about 1400 km from Tobolsk and 3200 km from Moscow. An alternative route led from the Irtysh-Ob juncture 450 km up the Ob to the Vakh, 500 km up the Vakh, then portage to the Sym, down it to the Yenisei, upstream to Yenisesk. Yenisey and Lena Basins: Yeniseysk is on the Yenisei River just north of its juncture with the Angara River. From Yeniseysk east up the Angara to the Ilim River, upstream to Ilimsk (1630), portage to Kuta River, short trip downstream to Ust-Kut (1631) on the Lena River. From here northeast down the Lena about 1400 km to Yakutsk, which is 4900 km east of Moscow. Yakutsk is a major stopping point and administrative center. Then 125 km down the Lena to the Aldan, up the Aldan River to Ust-Maya, then up the Maya River or its right branch, the Yudoma River. Okhotsk: From either of the last two, it is about 150 km over 2000 ft mountains to the Pacific (Okhotsk Coast 1639, Okhotsk town, 1647). Pack horses were used here. Okhotsk is 800 km east southeast of Yakutsk and 5,600 km east of Moscow. After 1715 there were shipbuilding facilities at Okhotsk, allowing sea travel to the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Kuril Islands, the Aleutian Islands and Alaska. To the Amur: From 1643 to 1689 the Russians attempted to penetrate from the Lena south to the Amur region but were driven back by the Manchus. See Russian-Manchu border conflicts. From 1689 to 1859 the Russo-Chinese border was the Argun River and the Stanovoy Mountains. In 1859 Russia annexed the Amur region. From the west, the Russians penetrated to Ulan-Ude (1666), Chita (1653) and Nerchinsk (1654) toward the Argun. From 1727 much Russo-Chinese trade shifted to Kyakhta near where the Selenge River crosses the current Russo-Mongol border. Northern Route From at least the 12th century, Russian Pomors navigated the White and Barents Seas. At some date, they entered the Ob Gulf or portaged across the Yamal Peninsula. From the Gulf of Ob to the Taz Estuary, up the Taz River, past Mangazeya (1601), portage to Yanov Stan on the Turukhan River, leading to Turukhansk (1607) on the Yenisei at its juncture with the Lower Tunguska. East up the Lower Tunguska. Where it turns south, portage to the Chona River, a tributary of the Vilyuy River - the junction of these two rivers has now been flooded, forming the Viluyskoe Reservoir. East along the Vilyuy to the Lena River, and then up the Lena to Yakutsk. It was also possible to continue up the Lower Tunguska to near Kirensk (1630) (175 km northeast of Ust-Kut), make a short portage to the Lena, and down the Lena to Yakutsk. Yakutsk is about 2400 km from the Taz Estuary. After about 1700 most trade shifted south and the route west of Turukhansk was largely abandoned. Northeast From the mouth of the Lena River, along the coast to the mouth of the Kolyma River, up to Bolshoy Anyuy River, portage, down the Anadyr River to Anadyrsk (1650). One could continue down the Anadyr to the Pacific, but the area was too barren to be of interest. The area northeast of this route was avoided because of the warlike Chukchis. About 1700 Russians entered the Kamchatka Peninsula from Anadyrsk and later sailed there from Okhotsk. It is 1800 km from Yakutsk to the Bering Strait. Southwest After the conquest of Astrakhan in 1566, Russia expanded southeast around the southern base of the Urals. This involved increasing political control over the Nogai Horde, the Kalmyks and the northern Kazakhs, followed by varying degrees of peasant colonization. Another route was up the Irtysh toward the Altai country (Semipalatinsk, 1718). Decline of the River Route The importance of the water routes is evinced by this map from a 1773 atlas of the world, which shows a continuous chain of populated places (likely, just villages, but also the town of Ilimsk) along the Angara, Ilim, and Lena. A modern map would show instead a chain of towns along the more direct railway route from Krasnoyarsk to Irkutsk (where nothing much is shown in 1773), with only a few towns (associated with modern hydro dams) on the Angara. The southern border of Siberia corresponds to the forest-steppe boundary. Russian penetration of Asia was confined to the forest zone because the cossacks had the skills to travel through river and forest, because the native peoples were few and weak and because their expansion was paid for by the fur trade. Unlike Russia proper, there was little attempt to penetrate the steppe. Road building began in the 1730s. Although there were always some peasants, massive peasant colonization did not begin until the 1860s. The Trans-Siberian Railway began in 1891. In the twentieth century highways were built, but the stretch north of the Amur is still not complete. It goes without saying that all of this development took place as far south as possible. The result is a pattern in which the Russians form a long narrow belt along the southern border with some extensions northward, mainly to where minerals can be found. The rivers are still used, but largely for north-south transport to and from the Trans-Siberian Railway.

Prior to his election to the Senate, he served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 46th District. History Legg was born in Brooksville and attended Pasco‚ÄìHernando Community College, receiving his associate degree in 1994, and then the University of South Florida, receiving a degree in social work in 1995. In 1998, Legg began working for State Representative Heather Fiorentino as her staff director, a position he would hold until 2001. Legg was a founding member of the Dayspring Academy, a Pasco County-based charter school, in 2000, where he taught middle and high school courses. Florida House of Representatives In 2002, Republican State Representative Mike Fasano was unable to seek re-election due to term limits. Legg ran to succeed him in the 45th District, which stretched from Dunedin to New Port Richey in Pasco County and Pinellas County. Legg faced Tom Anderson, the Mayor of Dunedin, in the Republican primary. Anderson ended up defeating Legg by a wide margin, winning 55% of the vote to Legg's 45%. When State Representative Heather Fiorentino opted to run for Pasco County Superintendent of Schools instead of seeking re-election, Legg ran to succeed her in the 46th District, which stretched from New Port Richey to Shady Hills in western Pasco County. Legg faced attorney John Stewart in the Republican primary, and campaigned on his promise to \\"protect life and the sanctity of marriage\\" and his support for improving the quality of public education, while Stewart focused on environmental protection and limiting medical malpractice lawsuits. During the campaign, Stewart was attacked by a third-party group for allegedly supporting drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants and for opposing then-Governor Jeb Bush's education reforms, an attack that Stewart denounced and that Legg said he did not support. Legg ended up winning the nomination, receiving 54% of the vote to Stewart's 46%, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Dee Thomas, a physical therapist and the Democratic nominee. The Florida Democratic Party and the Republican Party of Florida both heavily invested in the race, given that the Republicans' two-thirds majority in the state House was at risk. Despite the fact that the district voted for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election, Legg defeated Thomas by a wide margin, winning 56% of the vote to her 44%. Legg was re-elected unopposed in 2006. In 2008, he faced Ron Rice, a land surveyor for the city of Clearwater and the Democratic nominee, and John Ubele, a member of a white nationalist organization and an independent candidate. During the campaign, Legg faced a minor scandal when it was discovered that Legg maintained two residences, one inside the district and one outside the district, where he lived with his new wife. Given that legislators are required to live in the districts they represent, Rice noted, \\"It seems to me as if Mr. Legg is having a difficult time choosing between his family and his political career.\\" The Tampa Bay Times endorsed Legg for re- election, praising him as a \\"strong supporter for consumers and senior citizens,\\" and noting that while Rice was \\"an affable advocate for the working class,\\" his experience was less significant than Legg's. Ultimately, Legg was re-elected to a third term in a landslide over his opponents, receiving 58% of the vote to Rice's 39% and Ubele's 3%. Legg was re-elected to his fourth and final term unopposed in 2010. Florida Senate In 2012, following the reconfiguration of the state's legislative districts, Legg, unable to seek a fifth term in the House due to term limits, opted to run for the Florida Senate. He was initially planning on running in the 18th District, and would have faced wealthy egg farmer Wilton Simpson in the primary. Legg ended up withdrawing from the 18th District, however, instead opting to run in the 17th District, challenging Republican State Senator Jim Norman in the primary. Norman, however, ultimately ended up declining to seek another term, and Legg ended up facing former State Representative Rob Wallace and security consultant John Korsak in the primary. The Tampa Bay Times endorsed Legg, citing his \\"ability to develop a consensus\\" to address problems, though noting that he shaped education policy, \\"both good and bad,\\" pushing \\"controversial bills.\\" Legg ended up defeating Wallace and Korsak by a wide margin, winning 62% of the vote to Wallace's 23% and Korsak's 15%. He advanced to the general election, where he was elected unopposed. In 2015, litigation concerning Florida Senate maps was resolved with an admission by the Senate that the maps violated the Fair Districts provision of the Constitution of Florida. Following the inability of the legislature to create and pass new maps into law, the Florida Supreme Court selected maps drawn by the League of Women Voters of Florida. Consequently, Legg was drawn into the 10th District, where Wilton Simpson, the Senate President-designate for the 2018-2020 term, is seeking re-election. He ultimately declined to run for re-election to a second term in 2016. In the meantime, he is considering running for the Senate in 2018 to replace term-limited Senator Jack Latvala, who represents a district that includes parts of Pasco County and Pinellas County.

Early life Scibetta was born and raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, like his future brother-in-law Gravano. He was the only son born to first generation immigrants, his father from Cammarata in the province of Agrigento, Sicily, and his Italian-American mother from Bayonne, New Jersey. Scibetta had two older sisters, Debra and Diane. His mother was a housewife and their father was \\"a terrific father, but very strict\\" man who was a certified electrical engineer who worked the night shift for Western Electric (now AT&T; Technologies) putting together circuit boards for the telephone company. In 1971, Gravano married Debra. Falling out with the Gambino crime family and murder In 1978, Castellano allegedly ordered the murder of Gambino associate Scibetta. A cocaine and alcohol user, Scibetta participated in several public fights and insulted the daughter of George DeCicco. Since Scibetta was Salvatore \\"Sammy the Bull\\" Gravano's brother-in- law, Castellano asked Frank DeCicco to first notify Gravano of the impending hit. When advised of Scibetta's fate, a furious Gravano said he would kill Castellano first. However, Gravano was eventually calmed by DeCicco and accepted Scibetta's death as the punishment earned by his behavior. Another part of the motive for the murder was that Scibetta was suspected of being gay. Gravano later said, \\"I chose against Nicky. I took an oath that Cosa Nostra came before everything.\\" Scibetta was dismembered and his body was never found other than an arm. In popular culture In the made for television HBO movie Gotti, Scibetta is portrayed as \\"Nicky Scibetta\\" by actor Frank Crudele. In the film Witness to the Mob, Nicky is portrayed by actor Kirk Acevedo. He is allegedly a real life inspiration for HBO prison drama series Oz characters father and son, Nino Schibetta and Peter Schibetta. =Discrepancies in film= In the television movie Gotti, Sammy Gravano, portrayed by William Forsythe, murders Nicholas by himself in a construction supply warehouse, while in his autobiography Underboss he states that members of Gravano's own crew, allegedly Liborio Milito and Joseph D'Angelo and Frank DeCicco, carried out the murder contract for Paul Castellano and not Gravano. The Gravano character also states that his wife Debra, the sister of Nicholas, would be divorcing him after he testified in court about being an accomplice in both before and after the fact of Nicholas' gangland execution, Debra did not.

He was the first African American news anchor in South Florida and became one of the state's most watched and longest running anchors. \\"Miami Herald (Archived) (fee-based article retrieval) Early life Dwight Lauderdale was born and raised in a working-class suburb of Columbus, Ohio. He describes his parents as \\"hardworking\\". \\"My parents\\" he says \\" were strict disciplinarians, and while I thought it was unfair back then, I'm glad they were that way because it kept me out of trouble \\" His father, in particular, taught him the importance of being himself. \\"My father\\" he says \\" taught me to never allow anyone to define who I am, that I am the only one who can do that. He taught me to not think of myself as a victim \\" He took this lesson to heart and started on a path that would include entering and winning many oratorical (speech) contests that eventually led to him being publicly recognized in local newspaper articles. One such article would lead to a phone call that would set him on the path to become South Florida's first black anchor. Career At age 17, after winning an oratorical contest, Lauderdale received a job offer from the news director at WTVN-TV (ABC) in Columbus. He accepted the job and started work in November 1968, part-time at night, processing film. (Some sources claim it was WSYX-TV). He did not have to drop school to accept the job. He did everything from processing film, to writing news copy, to producing, and for on-air talent. He completed his education at Ohio University, majoring in Communications and graduating cum laude in 1973. In 1974, Lauderdale moved to South Florida for a reporting opportunity at Channel 7 (WCKT-TV, at the time). Two years later, WPLG offered him a three-year contract as a reporter/weekend anchor, and he accepted the job. He quickly established himself as a prolific street reporter, working half a dozen stories per day, including the Mariel Boatlift. He also managed to score the first one-on-one interview of Bill Clinton's presidency. More than anything, he remembers the rigid ground rules: \\" Seven minutes only, and they were standing there with a stopwatch\\".\\"Miami Herald\\" He was bumped up to the weeknight anchor desk in June 1985 on an interim basis, which was made permanent the following January. His first anchor partner was Ann Bishop and later shared anchoring duties with Diane Magnum, Kristi Krueger and Laurie Jennings. Lasik In July 2004, Lauderdale had his Lasik surgery televised. Lauderdale, who was farsighted, learned that he might be a candidate for corrective eye surgery after viewing a news story about this surgery on his own station. Lauderdale sought a consultation when he realized just how critical the surgery was to his job performance. He never had a problem reading the teleprompter, which was 20 feet away from him, but did have a problem one time when he had to read from a script without his glasses. Lauderdale was treated by monovision and modified monovision (two strategies to treat each eye, one for reading and one for distance).\\"Millennium Laser Eye Center\\" Retirement On February 25, 2008, Dwight Lauderdale announced that he would be retiring in May of that year. WPLG's final broadcast with Lauderdale as an anchor was on May 22, 2008. Awards Dwight Lauderdale has been awarded the N.A.T.A.S Silver Circle Award, The Ohio State Award, and two Florida Emmy's, as well as a Sun-Sentinel reader's award in 1998 as the number one Anchor in the market. South Florida Magazine named him best news anchor in 1990. Additionally, Dwight Lauderdale has a scholarship in his name (The Dwight Lauderdale Scholarship) at Barry University which is awarded to students in broadcast communications each seminar.

Schmidt (May 6, 1938 ‚Äì March 27, 2020) was an American chemist, inventor, author, and Regents Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota. He is well known for his extensive work in surface science, detailed chemistry (microkinetics), chemical reaction engineering, catalysis, and renewable energy. He is also well known for mentoring over a hundred graduate students and his work on millisecond reactors and reactive flash volatilization.  Education and research  Born in Waukegan, Illinois, Schmidt received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1960 from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. From 1960 to 1964, he attended the University of Chicago, where he received a Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry and was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. Among many research endeavors, his thesis on alkali metal adsorption was supervised by Robert Gomer. In 1965, he completed a postdoctoral year at the University of Chicago. = Research at Minnesota = In 1965, he joined the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota as an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. Schmidt's research focused on various aspects of the chemistry and engineering of chemical reactions on solid surfaces. Reaction systems of recent interest are catalytic combustion processes to produce products such as syngas, olefins, and oxygenates by partial oxidation, NOx removal, and incineration by total oxidation. One topic of his research is the characterization of adsorption and reactions on well-defined single-crystal surfaces. A second research topic is steady-state and transient reaction kinetics under conditions from ultrahigh vacuum to atmospheric pressure. Schmidt also researched catalytic reaction engineering, in which detailed models of reactors are constructed to simulate industrial reactor performance, with particular emphasis on chemical synthesis and on catalytic combustion. = Millisecond Reactors = Schmidt's research since the early 1990s has focused on the catalytic partial oxidation of alkanes (particularly methane) and oxygenates in continuous flow fixed bed supported catalyst reactors. In 2004, Schmidt and his graduate students demonstrated that biomass-derived ethanol could be converted to molecular hydrogen for fuel cell at greater than 100% selectivity. The significant potential of this discovery has been well- described: > There is, however, a better way of storing the hydrogen needed for fuel > cells: in ethanol, each molecule of which bundles six hydrogen atoms, two > carbon atoms, and one oxygen atom into a package far more compact than > gaseous hydrogen. Until recently, no one could figure out how to unbundle > the ethanol molecules in an energy-efficient way. But Lanny Schmidt, a > chemical engineer at the University of Minnesota, may now have found a > silver bullet. He has developed a glass tube containing a series of metal > plates about the size of a Bic lighter. Made out of the exotic metals > rhodium and cerium, these plates can suck the hydrogen out of ethanol and > feed it into a fuel cell. (Ironically, Schmidt had been looking for a > catalyst that would strip hydrogen from plain old gasoline, but the ethanol > turned out to work even better.)\\" -- Sam Jaffe, Washington Monthly The discovery has been referenced over 200 times, and it led to Schmidt being listed among the Scientific American top 50 researchers of 2004.  Academic accomplishments  Lanny Schmidt receives the Neal R. Amundson Award at the North American Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering. Schmidt has published over 350 papers in refereed journals and was a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He has supervised approximately 90 Ph.D. theses and 15 M.S. theses at Minnesota, and 14 of his former students hold university teaching positions including Maria Flytzani-Stephanopoulos, Raymond Gorte and Dionisios Vlachos. In 2013, he was awarded the Neal R. Amundson Award at the 3rd North American Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering. Schmidt has previously been awarded the Parravano Award (1997) by the Michigan Catalysis Society, the Alpha Xi Sigma Award (1993) by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and a Humboldt Prize (1994) from Germany. He has been honored by several institutions through supported lectures including the Reilly Lectures (1990) at Notre Dame, the Dodge Lectures (1992) at Yale University, the Mason Lectures (1996) at Stanford University, the Merck Lecture (1997) at Rutgers University, the Centennial Lecture (1997) at Purdue University, the Schiut Lecture (1997) at the University of Delaware and the Hottell Lecture (1999) at MIT. In 2000, he was a plenary speaker at the International Congress on Catalysis in Spain, and in 1998 he served as the Fairchild Scholar at the California Institute of Technology.  Policy and public service  Throughout his career, Schmidt has promoted the importance of reaction engineering to chemical engineering and chemistry as a separate discipline. In 2004, he published the second edition of his best-selling textbook, The Engineering of Chemical Reactions, which stressed the importance of the relationships between thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport phenomena for a full understanding of reactor design. Since 2003, Schmidt has been a strong advocate of biomass-derived energy and a supporter of biomass processing research as a solution to the decreasing petroleum supply. He frequently argued that thermochemical (non-biological) biomass conversion processes have significant advantages over biological processes that will eventually permit small-scale, highly efficient biomass-to-fuel chemical plants.  Achievements and key publications  Schmidt has authored the following journal articles describing significant advances in chemical reaction engineering:  * References  External links  *Schmidt Research Group at the University of Minnesota *Lanny D.

Born and raised in Chicago, Sopkin was about twelve years old when he first played the cello. By age eighteen, six years later, he was auditioning for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Frederick Stock looked at Sopkin and said, \\"So we're taking Boy Scouts now?\\". Stock gave him the job, making him one of the youngest performers with the orchestra. He earned $65 per week for the symphony's 28-week season, plus a seven-week summer session, a respectable income for the Great Depression, especially for a teenager. Sopkin spent eight years with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.Silvers, Amy Rabideau. \\"Cellist Sopkin lived for music\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 1, 2008. Accessed November 5, 2008. He left in symphony in 1941 to form the Fine Arts Quartet together with violinist Leonard Sorkin, who had also performed with the Chicago Symphony. Sopkin served together with other musicians in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II in Orlando, Florida. Sopkin and other musicians made records of their performances that were sold at the PX. After returning from military service, the Fine Arts Quartet was revived, operating in Chicago under the auspices of the American Broadcasting Company. The members of the quartet joined the music faculty of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee in 1964, and the quartet relocated there. Sopkin left the Fine Arts Quartet in 1979 following a hand injury and a detached retina, but continued to make occasional guest appearances with the group. Violinist Abram Loft, who played with the quartet from 1954 until 1979, noted that they had made 60 records and played in 270 cities in 28 countries during the 25 years they spent together in the quartet. After retiring and moving to Maine, Sopkin became involved with the annual school and chamber music festival at Kneisel Hall, joining the school's staff in 1995. He advocated for the addition of sessions for adult and amateur musicians. He pushed for the creation of the annual House concerts, which have provided a major source of additional revenue for the school. Sopkin's efforts led to bringing students to Maine early so that they could perform in area schools before the summer programs began.Hewitt, Rich. \\"Cellist George Sopkin of Surry dies at 94\\", Bangor Daily News.

Today the site, known as Tel Tzafit, is an Israeli national park incorporating archaeological remains which some have identified as the Philistine city of Gath, mentioned in the Bible.Hastings and Driver, 2004, p. 114 The remains of the Crusader fort and the Arab village can also be seen on the tell. Geography Tel Tzafit excavations Tell es-Safi sits on a site above the plain of Philistia and above sea level, and its white-faced precipices can be seen from the north and west from several hours distant. Tell es-Safi is situated between the Israeli cities of Ashkelon and Beit Shemesh and is one of the country's largest Bronze and Iron Age sites.Archaeology: The Science of the Human Past, Mark Sulton History Excavations at Tell es-Safi since 1996 indicate that the site was settled, \\"virtually continuously from the Chalcolithic until the modern periods.\\"Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 445 =Bronze and Iron Ages= Stratigraphic evidence attests to settlement in the Late Bronze and Iron Age (I & II) periods. A large city in the Iron Age, the site was \\"enclosed on three sides by a large man-made siege-moat.\\"Wigoder, 2005, pp. 348‚Äì9. Victor Gu√©rin thought that Tell es-Safi was the \\"watch-tower\\" mentioned in , based on its etymological meaning,Gu√©rin, V. (1869), p. 90‚Äìff. but the site is now believed to be the site of the Philistine city of Gath. The identification was opposed by Albright, who noted its proximity to Tel Miqne (Ekron), but later excavations turned up more supportive evidence for Tell es-Safi.Gath in the Bible gath.wordpress.comBromiley, 1982, pp. 411-413 Schniedewind writes that Gath was important for the Philistines in the eighth century BCE because of its easily defended geographical position. Albright argued that Tell es-Safi was too close to Tel Miqne/Ekron to be Gath. The sites are only 8 km apart. However, both Tell es-Safi and Tel Miqne were major sites in the Middle Bronze through the Iron Age. The agricultural features of this region of the southern coastal plain may be part of the explanation. Additionally, there is no certainty that the two sites flourished simultaneously. Literary sources suggest that Gath flourished in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages until its destruction by the Assyrians in the late eighth century B.C.E. The heyday of Ekron was the seventh century B.C.E., after the site was taken over by the Assyrians as an agricultural administrative center (Dothan and Gitin 1993).William M. Schniedewind, The Geopolitical History of Philistine Gath. Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 309 (Feb., 1998), pp. 69‚Äì77 According to 2010 reports, Israeli archaeologists uncovered a Philistines temple and evidence of a major earthquake in biblical times. Other major finds were evidence of destruction by Hazael King of Aram-Damascus around 830 BCE, and evidence of the first Philistine settlement in Canaan.In the Spotlight, Jerusalem Post. 07/29/2010 Radiocarbon dating in 2015 showed an early appearance of Philistine material culture in the city.RADIOCARBON DATING SHOWS AN EARLY APPEARANCE OF PHILISTINE MATERIAL CULTURE IN TELL ES-SAFI/GATH, PHILISTIA, University of Melbourne The Tell es-Safi inscription dated to ca 1000 BCE was found at the site in 2005. Archaeologists have also discovered a horned altar dating to the ninth century B.C.E. The stone altar is over 3 feet (one meter) tall, and is the earliest ever found in Philistia. The altar features a pair of horns, which is similar to the ancient Israelite altars described in the Hebrew Bible.Exodus 27:1‚Äì2; 1 Kings 1:50 Nevertheless, the Israelite altars typically have four horns, such as found in Tel Be'er Sheva, for example, as opposed to two.Horned Philistine Altar Discovered at Gath July 26, 2011 biblicalarchaeology.org =Byzantine period= View from the mound to the east The place appears on the Madaba Map as Saphitha ().Kallai-Kleinmann (1958), p. 155 =Crusader and Ayyubid period= During the Crusades, the site was called Blanchegarde, (\\"White guard\\"), likely referring to the white rock outcrop next to the site.Khalidi, 1992, p. 222 In 1142 a fort was built on the site by King Fulk, it was dismantled after being taken by Saladin in 1191,Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 440 but reconstructed by Richard of England in 1192.

He noted the remains of a well and the crumbling stone walls of a pool. The surrounding land was planted by Israeli farmers with citrus trees, sunflowers, and grain. A few tents belonging to Bedouin were occasionally pitched nearby.

However the grape did not provide the same level of fruit and softening effect that Canaiolo did and fell out of favour. In the late 1980s, there was a surge of interest in the variety among Tuscan winemakers who saw in this local grape variety similarity to the role Petit Verdot plays in Bordeaux blends. Colorino was planted and used to add darker colours and structure from phenolic compounds in the grape's thick skin without the overpowering aromatics that Cabernet Sauvignon could add.

The Coptic Christians killed in this incident were considered martyrs of the Coptic Orthodox Church by Pope Shenouda III. A book entitled Massacre at the Millennium was published in 2001 by Freedom House documenting the events. Kosheh Kosheh is located on the east bank of the Nile in Sohag governorate, a few miles east of Balyana. The population of Kosheh is about 35,000 and 70% of the village are Christian Copts. Kosheh is the trading center for a number of villages in the area. There is little farmland in Kosheh; it serves rather as the shopping nexus for the rural areas around it. Most of the shopkeepers are Copts, while most of the farmers in the surrounding villages are Muslims from Arab tribes. First Kosheh Massacre Tensions between Christians and Muslims had started a few years earlier, in August 1998, in what is known as the First Kosheh Massacre. In this incident, two Copts were murdered by Muslims. The Muslims in turn were allegedly seeking revenge for the \\"poisoning\\" of a brother. In response, the Egyptian police responded by rounding up about 1,200 Christians for investigation into the murder. When Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, criticised the arrests, he was himself arrested with two of his priests, and was charged with inciting strife and damaging national unity between Christians and Muslims. In October 1998, an article by Christina Lamb in London's Daily Telegraph reported that some of the arrested Copts had undergone mock crucifixions and that Metropolitan Wissa faced possible execution. The Egyptian government was outraged at the negative publicity, and arrested the head of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), whom it accused of having given the story to the Daily Telegraph. The head of the EOHR and Metropolitan Wissa were eventually released. Although the government promised to punish any police officers who had acted improperly, some of the police officers involved in the human rights violations against the Copts in el-Kosheh were in fact promoted. Thus, the First Kosheh Massacre turned into an international incident. As a result, Coptic groups in the West began to push for the US Congress to include Egypt among nations that discriminate against Christians. Second Kosheh Massacre The Second Kosheh Massacre took place about one year later, on Friday 31 December 1999. The incidence stemmed from a quarrel between a Christian merchant and a Muslim customer. The misunderstanding strained Muslim-Christian relations in the community. Relatives of the Muslim customer targeted Christian-owned shops and homes, which were looted, destroyed, and burned. Initially, the police was able to contain the situation. However, two days later on Sunday 2 January 2000, riots spread violence into neighbouring villages and lead to the murders of 20 Christians. One Muslim was also accidentally shot dead by a fellow Muslim. More than 40 people were injured in the two-day incident. 260 shops, houses and kiosks were also deliberately burnt or damaged. Most of the killings took place in the outskirts of el-Kosheh, especially in the agriculture fields. This event was one of Egypt's bloodiest massacres. The local authorities during the incident did little to control the situation. There were some cases where these officers participated in the killings. Following the massacre, the entire Coptic community felt that these events epitomised the criminal negligence of the Egyptian administration, represented in its police force, when it comes to protecting Coptic lives and property. Since local police units are often drawn from the local community, local feuds including Muslim resentment of Christian families can very well influence police behaviour. On 1 December 2000, a criminal court in Egypt's Sohag governorate released without bail all 89 defendants charged in the New Year's massacre in el- Kosheh. It was unprecedented in Egypt that several dozen murder suspects would be released without bail a month before their verdict was determined. All suspects that were initially arrested in connection to this massacre were eventually acquitted had their charges dropped. The only person convicted in the massacre was a Muslim charged with accidental killing of another Muslim, and sentenced to 13 years in prison. No one was ever convicted for the murder of the 21 Christian victims. This led to outrage in the Coptic community who felt that these suspects should be in custody. The Pope of Alexandria Shenouda III rejected the verdict openly, and told reporters \\"We want to challenge this ruling. We don't accept it.\\" Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, called the ruling \\"A shame that defames the reputation of Egypt and an invitation for more violence\\". Egypt's Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahid appealed the acquittal verdict of the defendants, stating that \\"there is no doubt that 21 people were killed, and the killers must be brought to justice,\\" \\"We never imagined that they would release the killers, but this is Egypt\\" a Copt from el-Kosheh admitted by telephone. Six days following the acquittal of the defendants, the homes of four Christian families in el-Kosheh were set to fire and completely destroyed. One of the homeowners who reported the arson to the Egyptian police was tortured and forced to sign a statement prepared by a public prosecutor charging him with perpetrating the whole incident. He was subsequently forced to post bail for his own release.

It constitutes one of the most influential and controversial urban doctrines of European modernism. Although Le Corbusier had exhibited his ideas for the ideal city, the Ville contemporaine in the 1920s, during contact with international planners he began work on the Ville Radieuse. In 1930 he had become an active member of the syndicalist movement and proposed the Ville radieuse as a blueprint of social reform. The principles of the Ville radieuse were incorporated into his later publication, the Athens Charter published in 1933. His utopian ideal formed the basis of a number of urban plans during the 1930s and 1940s culminating in the design and construction of the first Unit√© d'habitation in Marseille in 1952. The development of an ideal In the late 1920s Le Corbusier lost confidence in big business to realise his dreams of utopia represented in the Ville Contemporaine and Plan Voisin (1925). Influenced by the linear city ideas of Arturo Soria y Mata (which Milyutin also employed) and the theories of the syndicalist movement (that he had recently joined) he formulated a new vision of the ideal city, the Ville Radieuse. It represented a utopian dream to reunite man within a well-ordered environment. Unlike the radial design of the Ville Contemporaine, the Ville Radieuse was a linear city based upon the abstract shape of the human body with head, spine, arms and legs. The design maintained the idea of high-rise housing blocks, free circulation and abundant green spaces proposed in his earlier work. The blocks of housing were laid out in long lines stepping in and out. Like the Swiss Pavilion they were glazed on their south side and were raised up on pilotis. They had roof terraces and running tracks on their roofs. The Ville Radieuse also made reference to Corbusier's work in Russia. In 1930, he wrote a 59-page Reply to Moscow when commenting upon a competition in Moscow. The report contained drawings defining an alternative urban model for the planning of the city. He exhibited the first representations of his ideas at the third CIAM meeting in Brussels in 1930 (although he withdrew the Moscow proposals). In addition he developed proposals for the Ferme Radieuse (Radiant Farm) and Village Radieuse (Radiant Village). Spreading the idea Throughout the thirties Le Corbusier spread the message of his new, ideal city. Discussions at the fourth CIAM meeting on board the SS Patris bound for Athens were incorporated into Corbusier's book, The Radiant City (published in 1933). This in turn influenced the Athens Charter. Between 1931 and 1940 Corbusier undertook a series of town planning proposals for Algiers. During that period Algiers was the administrative capital of French North Africa. Although he was not officially invited to submit proposals for the city, he knew the mayor was interested so he tried his luck. The plan had to incorporate the existing casbah whilst allowing for the linear growth of the increasing population. The resulting Obus Plan was a variation on the Ville Radieuse, adapted for a very specific culture and landscape. It comprised four main elements: an administration area by the water in two slab blocks, convex and concave apartment blocks for the middle classes up on the slopes above the city, an elevated roadway on a north-south axis above the casbah and a meandering viaduct with a road on top meandering down the coast. In 1933 in Nemours, North Africa he proposed eighteen Unit√© apartment blocks orientated north- south against a backdrop of mountains. On his 1935 trip to the United States, Corbusier criticised the skyscrapers of Manhattan for being too small and too close together. He proposed replacing all the existing buildings with one huge Cartesian Skyscraper equipped with living and working units. This would have cleared the way for more parkland, thus conforming to the ideals of the Ville Radieuse. Even as late as the 1940s he was trying to court both Mussolini and the Vichy government to adopt his ideal city plans. Corbusier's best opportunity for the realisation of his plans were the designs for Chandigarh, India, which he developed in 1949. From 1945 to 1952 he undertook the design and construction of the Unit√© d'Habitation in Marseilles. The Unit√© embodied the ideas of the Ville Radieuse that he had developed in Nemours and Algiers. When designing the layout for Brasilia, architects L√∫cio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer were influenced by the plans for the Ville Radieuse.

Background Liu Zi was born in 729, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family traced its ancestry to the imperial house of Han Dynasty and a line of officials of the Jin Dynasty (265-420), Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Sui Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty.New Book of Tang, vol. 71.. Liu Zi's grandfather Liu Zixuan was a prominent official and historian during Emperor Xuanzong's reign, and his father Liu Kuang (ÂäâË≤∫) continued in the role of historian thereafter.Old Book of Tang, vol. 136 . Career prior to chancellorship Because of his heritage, Liu Zi was made a scribe to the crown prince when he was young.As it is not known during which emperor's reign this occurred, it is not known which crown prince Liu Zi served under. He later served as the magistrate of Lianshui County (Êº£Ê∞¥, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu). Thereafter, the deputy minister of civil service affairs, Yang Wan, recommended him as someone who can serve as an advisor to the emperor, and so he was recalled to be Zuo Bujue (Â∑¶Ë£úÈóï), a low-level official at the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng).It is not known which year Yang Wan became deputy minister of civil service affairs, but it was after 764, and he was moved to another position in 770, and therefore this must have happened during those years. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 119 . He later resigned in order to take care of his mother, then at the eastern capital Luoyang, and while there, Li Yi (ÊùéÂªô) the mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region) commissioned him to be a civil service officer. When his mother died, he left government service to observe a period of mourning for her. After the period of mourning was over, he was recalled to the imperial government to serve as Tuntian Yuanwailang (Â±ØÁî∞Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®, Gongbu). He later served as Sixun Yuanwailang (Âè∏Âã≥Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, L√¨bu), but took on the additional responsibility of selecting low level officials. It was said that he was diligent in his duties and followed the law. He was later promoted to be Sixun Langzhong (Âè∏Âã≥ÈÉé‰∏≠), the supervisor of the officials who served as Sixun Yuanwailang, and yet later became an imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong). In 783, Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong was forced to flee the capital Chang'an when soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (Ê∂áÂéü, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) mutinied and supported the general Zhu Ci as their leader. Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian (Â•âÂ§©, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. Liu Zi followed him there, and served as deputy minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Â∞ëÂçø, Taichang Shaoqing), in charge of ceremonies. In 784, he was made the deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). At that time, as the persons from the southern parts of the empire, who normally would have gone to Chang'an to stand for imperial examinations, were unable to do so due to the wars and the famine in the Chang'an region at the time, Emperor Dezong sent Liu to Hong Prefecture (Ê¥™Â∑û, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), to examine them there. It was said that he carried out his duties well there. During and after chancellorship In 786, Liu Zi was made Zuo Sanqi Changshi (Â∑¶Êï£È®éÂ∏∏‰æç), a high-level consultant at the examination bureau, and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto, along with Qi Ying and Cui Zao. It was said that Emperor Dezong gave Cui the responsibilities because Cui was daring to speak and act, and that Liu and Qi were both thus yielding much of the responsibilities to Cui. Emperor Dezong also put the chancellors in direct command over the six ministries of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), and Liu was given the responsibilities over the ministries of civil service affair and rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, L«êbu, notice different tone than the ministry of civil service affairs). In 787, he was removed from his chancellor position and served as Zuo Sanqi Changshi only.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. In 788, he was again deputy minister of civil service affairs, and in 790 he was made the minister of civil service affairs. While Dou Can was chancellor, because Dou wanted to also be minister of civil service affairs, Liu was made the minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu).As Dou was chancellor from 789 to 792, this change in position must have occurred before 792. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 136. Soon thereafter, Liu was indicted by imperial censor Wei Zhenbo (ÈüãË≤û‰ºØ) for having been insufficiently selective when selecting officials at the ministry of civil service affairs, and he, while not demoted, was stripped of the privilege of wearing gold and purple as due an official of his rank, along with his deputy minister Du Huangchang.New Book of Tang, vol. 132. Despite this, Liu's biography in the Old Book of Tang stated that he was well-learned, good at commenting, frugal, hard-working, and hated wickedness, and that while selecting officials, he was careful in examining officials' qualifications. It also stated that, as a result, those who submitted false credentials were particularly fearful of him. He died in 794 and was given posthumous honors.

It was composed in 1930 and given its first performance on 2 October of that year by its dedicatee, Helen Perkin (1909‚Äì1996), at a Promenade Concert in the Queen's Hall.Hyperion: The Romantic Concerto 39 The work was an immediate success and was frequently performed by pianists such as Clifford Curzon, Moura Lympany, Eileen Joyce, Gina Bachauer and Arthur Rubinstein. While it is considered one of the best piano concertos ever written by an Englishman, John Ireland Trust it is not often heard nowadays and is not part of the standard repertoire. Encouraged by its success, Ireland planned to write a second concerto, but he only completed one movement, which he called Legend. This was also dedicated to Helen Perkin and she performed it for the first time on 12 January 1934, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Adrian Boult. Ireland was romantically interested in Perkin, but these feelings were not reciprocated. Perkin took up with George Mountford Adie (1901‚Äì1989), an architectRichards, Fiona,\\"Helen Perkin: Pianist, Composer, and Muse of John Ireland\\" in Foreman (Ed) \\"The John Ireland Companion\\". Boydell Press, 2011, p. 137. and a disciple of George Gurdjieff, later marrying him and moving with him to Australia. As a result, Ireland withdrew the dedications of both works. Helen Perkin had played Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 at the Royal College of Music, and it is likely Ireland heard this performance and was influenced by the Russian's work. He had not, however, heard Ravel's G major Concerto since it did not appear until after Ireland's concerto was published. It is puzzling, therefore, that many commentators see echoes in Ireland's concerto not only of Prokofiev's concerto but also of Ravel's. In its jazzy rhythms, there are also hints of George Gershwin. The first person to record the Piano Concerto in E-flat was Eileen Joyce, in 1942, with the Hall√© Orchestra under Leslie Heward. She was also the soloist when the concerto was played at a special Proms concert in 1949, to celebrate Ireland's 70th birthday (this performance was also recorded, and released commercially). After the concert, Eileen Joyce and her partner took Ireland to dinner, and Percy Grainger also attended.Eileen Joyce timeline The concerto was again played at Ireland's 80th birthday concert. It has also been recorded by Eric Parkin (twice), Piers Lane, Kathryn Stott, Colin Horsley, Geoffrey Tozer, Mark Bebbington (as part of his complete John Ireland piano music edition) and John Lenehan. The Piano Concerto is in three movements, with the slow movement leading directly into the finale without a break. Ireland is said to have included a quotation from Helen Perkin's Phantasy String Quartet, which won a Cobbett Prize for composition earlier that year. But Perkin herself said it was \\"more a reminiscence than a direct quotation\\".Richards, Fiona: The Music of John Ireland, Ashgate, 2000 Notes Sources * Hyperion Records: The Romantic Piano Concerto, Vol. 39 ‚Äì Delius & Ireland * Alan Bush Music Trust: The Correspondence of Alan Bush and John Ireland * Review of Piers Lane recording Ireland Category:Concertos by John Ireland Category:Piano music by John Ireland Category:1930 compositions Category:Compositions in E-flat major ","title":"Piano Concerto (John Ireland)"},{"id":"20091265","text":"USS Wexford County (LST-1168), previously USS LST-1168, was a United States Navy landing ship tank (LST) in commission from 1953 to 1971, which saw service in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific and served in the Vietnam War..  Construction and commissioning  USS LST-1168 was laid down on 27 February 1952 by the Christy Corporation, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. She was launched on 28 November 1953, sponsored by Mrs. Philip K. Wrigley, and commissioned on 15 June 1954 with Lieutenant Commander Victor Vansant in command.  Atlantic and Caribbean service  Following commissioning, LST-1168 was assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet with a home port at Norfolk, Virginia. She spent the remainder of 1954 in training, shakedown, upkeep, and independent ship exercises. On 14 February 1955, LST-1168 departed Norfolk for a three-month tour of duty in the Caribbean, operating from the Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. While in the Caribbean, the ship visited San Juan and Ponce, Puerto Rico and St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. Upon returning to Norfolk in May, she engaged in exercises and spent the summer of 1955 on United States Naval Reserve cruises and midshipmen training exercises. Her name was changed from USS LST‚Äî1168 to USS Wexford County (LST-1168) on 1 July 1955. In late 1955, Wexford County entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for overhaul and remained there into April 1956. She completed overhaul and arrived at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia Beach, Virginia, on 4 April 1956. The ship then participated in United States East Coast operations until July 1956, when she deployed to the Caribbean. After stops at Vieques Island and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, she returned briefly to Little Creek, then set out for the United States West Coast via the Panama Canal.  Pacific service  Wexford County arrived at Long Beach, California, on 2 September 1956 and spent the rest of 1956 conducting routine operations off the California coast. In January 1957, Wexford County reported to Long Beach for overhaul and remained there until April 1957. She departed for San Francisco, California, on 4 April 1957 and entered an upkeep period which lasted until 20 June 1957. She arrived at San Diego, California, on 22 July 1957, where she continued operations along the California coast. Wexford County departed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and her first deployment to the Western Pacific on 23 January 1958 en route to Yokosuka, Japan. From Yokosuka, the ship made stops in Hong Kong; Sasebo, Japan; and Inchon, South Korea. On 24 June 1958, she left for San Diego and arrived there on 18 August 1958. After several months of activity, she went into upkeep on 5 December 1958 at Long Beach. On 29 January 1959, Wexford County departed for Yokosuka again via Hong Kong and Okinawa. She arrived at Yokosuka on 24 March 1959. The ship made several shuttles between Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan, and Naha, Okinawa. She left Yokosuka for San Diego, arriving there on 7 June 1959. The remainder of 1959 was spent in exercises off the coast and routine upkeep. During the next several years, Wexford County was involved in numerous routine operations along the California coast. A highlight of these years was a deployment to Guam, for which she departed San Diego on 2 January 1962. After steaming 5,480 nautical miles (10,149 kilometers), she arrived on 23 January 1962. She conducted operations for reconnaissance and installation of weather stations in the eastern Caroline Islands. The ship returned to San Diego on 1 September 1962. On 10 July 1963, she commenced overhaul at the Naval Station in San Diego, California, which lasted through late November 1963. January and February 1964 found Wexford County engaged in training. She was in a restricted availability status during March and April 1964. In May, she participated in Exercise Pine Tree, in which she served as a secondary control ship. During July 1964, she was in landing ship tank training. This was followed by Exercise Sea Bar, held near Fort Lewis, Washington, in conjunction with the United States Army. In this exercise, Wexford County acted as primary control ship. Returning to San Diego in mid-September, Wexford County entered upkeep for several weeks. She then took part in amphibious exercises with United States Marine Corps forces. Upon completion of various training exercises, the ship entered a Christmas holiday upkeep period. In early 1965, Wexford County took part in Operation Bubble Ops and Operation Silver Lance, which were at that time the largest peacetime amphibious operations ever conducted in the Pacific Ocean. Shortly after, she departed for Okinawa and Yokosuka, Japan. Following a brief stay, she sailed in early May 1965 for San Diego. During June and July 1965, she carried out local operations.  Vietnam War service  In August 1965, Wexford County again deployed for the Western Pacific and spent September 1965 in Da Nang, South Vietnam. Subsequent stops were made in Chu Lai and Qui Nhon, South Vietnam, and at Hong Kong. In December 1965, Wexford County returned to San Diego for the duration of the year. Wexford County was involved in local operations from January through April 1966 and provided services for the Amphibious School, Coronado, California. In late April, she steamed to Newport, Oregon, to participate in Newport's Loyalty Day celebration. On 1 May 1966, Wexford County returned to San Diego. On 12 July 1966, she arrived at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in Long Beach, California, for overhaul. She returned to San Diego on 9 November 1966 and began underway and refresher training on 27 November 1966. This training period ended on 16 December 1966. Amphibious training for Wexford County commenced on 16 January 1967 and continued through 27 January 1967. She briefly returned to Long Beach for further repair, then continued on to Hawaii to participate in landing exercises on Moloka'i and to lift U.S. Marine Corps forces to San Diego. In June 1967, Wexford County sailed to San Francisco, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, Washington, to embark U.S. Marine Corps troops bound for training at Camp Pendleton, California. She participated in various operations during July 1967, and, in late August, she repeated her stops along the United States West Coast to return Marine Corps units to their respective home ports. After returning to San Diego in September 1967, Wexford County began a tender availability period. Amphibious exercises and deployment preparations lasted through October 1967. In early November 1967, she sailed for South Vietnam by way of Pearl Harbor and Yokosuka. In December 1967, Wexford County reached South Vietnam and assumed her duties. On 4 January 1968, Wexford County arrived in Subic Bay, the Philippines, to off-load cargo and departed on 14 January 1968 to return to South Vietnam. She remained on station until 13 March 1968, at which time she left for Subic Bay, arriving there on 16 March 1968. She returned to Vietnam, via Hong Kong, on 5 April 1968 to rejoin forces off Vietnam. Wexford County left Vietnam in early May 1968 and returned to San Diego via Taiwan, Yokosuka, and Pearl Harbor. She arrived in San Diego on 26 June 1968, after approximately seven and one-half months overseas. For the next two months, she was in a restricted availability status. On 28 August 1968, she got underway for South Bend, Washington, to help celebrate the city's Labor Day festival. She returned to San Diego on 6 September 1968. Throughout September and October 1968, Wexford County carried out operations along the California coast. On 15 November 1968, she entered drydock at San Diego. Wexford County got underway on 12 January 1969 with a task group headed for Mazatl√°n, Mexico, arriving on 18 January 1969. She spent two weeks there involved in various training exercises. In February and March 1969, Wexford County was again in San Diego for routine maintenance. She departed for exercises at Treasure Island, California, on 14 April 1969. She sustained heavy damage to a main engine and spent May 1969 undergoing repairs at San Diego. A midshipmen cruise occupied the months of June and July 1969. August and September 1969 were devoted to exercises, and Wexford County spent the rest of 1969 in overhaul at San Diego. The yard period ended on 20 February 1970. Inspections, training, and preparations for deployment occurred from March through May 1970; and, on 2 June 1970, the ship left for Pearl Harbor and Guam. Wexford County reached Guam on 25 June 1970, and, after taking on new cargo, she left for Subic Bay, Philippines, and then to Vietnam. After unloading a construction battalion and their equipment, she departed for Hong Kong, arriving there on 30 July 1970. From 2 September 1970 through early November 1970, Wexford County was involved in numerous troop lifts, cargo transports, and exercises between Okinawa and Yokosuka and Numazu, Japan. On 2 November 1970, she detached and began the voyage back to San Diego via Subic Bay, Guam, Ponape, the Caroline Islands, and Pearl Harbor. She arrived at San Diego on 22 December 1970. Wexford County received a Meritorious Unit Commendation and five battle stars for her Vietnam War service.  Decommissioning and transfer to Spain  Wexford County spent 1971 in preparation for transfer to Spain. She was decommissioned on 29 October 1971 and transferred to the Spanish Navy through the Security Assistance Program that same day, although she was not stricken from the Navy List until 1 November 1976. In the Spanish Navy, she served as Martin Alvarez (L 12) from 1971 until 1995, when she was decommissioned and sold for scrapping.

All areas of government (national, state/provincial, and local) use written requirements to buy products or services to make purchasing fair and reduce costs. Outside of business circles, government proposal is commonly used to mean a legislative or other proposal by a government, in other words a legislative motion. Governments request competitive contract proposals when they believe there are more issues than initial cost in buying a needed product or service. In addition to cost, governments often consider issues such as risk (i.e., Will the product or service meet the government need?), schedule (i.e., Will the product or service be delivered or finished in time?), quality (i.e., Will the product or service meet the need each time it is delivered or needed?), long-term cost (i.e., What is the total cost of a product or service over its lifetime?). Most governments use proposals to buy any product that is not a commodity or to buy services that are not routine. In the United States, federal proposals are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, commonly referred to as the FAR. Most countries have at least some form of purchasing regulations that govern proposals. Regional and local governments have similar laws, although enforcement varies greatly. Government proposals are written in response to specific requests for proposals (RFPs). The RFPs specify the government's requirements for the product or service it intends to buy. In the United States, federal RFPs also specify, in accordance with the FAR, how the proposal should be prepared (Section L in the RFP) and what criteria will be used to evaluate proposals (Section M) Federal Acquisition Regulations. Other countries, states and local governments may also provide requirements for proposal preparation and evaluation criteria, although this is not always the case. Government proposal contents Most government proposals contain the following sections: *Requirements matrix, a pairing proposal requirements with where in the proposal the vendor's response will be found *Executive summary, a synopsis of why the government customer should buy from the proposing vendor *Technical/management discussion, a requirement-by-requirement narrative of how the vendor meets the requirements and a discussion of how the vendor will manage the contract if it is awarded *Cost volume, a presentation of all costs, including the cost basis (e.g., how labor rates were calculated), implementation plan, and implementation schedule * Past performance/relevant experience volume, detailing performance on past contracts of similar size and scope Most government proposals require a quality assurance plan, usually synonymous with AS9100. Size Because government proposals are always produced in response to written requirements, the proposals are lengthy in order to address adequately each requirement and, in the case of competitive proposals, the vendor's need to differentiate its product or service from other vendors. Short government proposals, including cost data, are at least 10 pages. Large proposals can range up to thousands of pages. Expense Government proposals are expensive to produce because of detailed requirements and necessary cost and scheduling information. Experts estimate the cost of producing a successful government proposal to be in the range of 0.5% to 2% of the initial contract value.

These casas-grandes were predominantly located in the northeast of Brazil (areas such as present day Bahia and Pernambuco). Additionally, sugar cane was grown in the interior, in the states of S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The casa-grande was made up of three main components: the Big House, the senzala (slave quarters), and the engenho (sugar cane mill). The master of sugar production was called the senhor de engenho (\\"master of the sugar works\\"). His word was final, and he had control over the land, the slaves, and the women who made up the plantation community.Death Without Weeping: The Violence of Everyday Life in Brazil, Nancy Scheper-Hughes, University of California Press, page 37-9At Home in the Street: Street Children of Northeast Brazil, Cambridge University Press, Tobias Hecht, page 155 The larger casas-grandes were self-sustaining, since they were isolated from the more developed coastal regions. Essential structures that were built included the school, the nursery, the infirmary, the family chapel, the master‚Äôs harem, the bank, and the cemetery. In the early days it was necessary to maintain an army on the plantation. Those armies were sometimes very large, having up to one hundred Indians/half- breeds. These plantations constituted a largely self-contained economic, social, political, and cultural system.The Repeating Island: The Caribbean and the Postmodern Perspective, Antonio Benitez-Rojo, Duke University Press, page 72  Master of sugar works  Gilberto Freyre wrote in his book Casa-Grande & Senzala, ‚ÄúOnce the Jesuit was overthrown the senhor de engenho dominated colonial life almost without interference. He was the true master of Brazil, more powerful than viceroys or bishops.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúThe truth is that around these senhores de engenho was created the most stable type of civilization in Hispanic America; and that type of civilization is exemplified by the heavy- set, horizontal architecture of the Big House.\\"The Epic of Latin America, Fourth Edition, University of California Press, John A. Crow, page 385 These land owners were usually very powerful Portuguese men, and they did their best to keep their blood pure. This of course meant heavy inbreeding to keep the aristocracy. Freyre also says in his book that their motto was ‚Äú A white woman to marry, a mulatto to take to bed, a Negress to do the work.‚ÄùThe Epic of Latin America, Fourth Edition, University of California Press, John A. Crow, page 386 These sugar cane plantations were somewhat similar to the larger Southern plantations in the U.S., being an agricultural industry run on slave labor, which became very powerful in both Brazil and the United States.

Along with the Administrative Litigation Act, it provides rules for the appeal and review of government decisions. Types of appeal There are three types of appeal provided under the Act: * , filed against the deciding entity * , filed against an entity which has oversight over the deciding entity * , an appeal of a review Ordinarily, when the deciding entity has no administrative oversight (e.g. a cabinet ministry, mayor or governor), an objection must be filed in the first instance. When the deciding entity has an overseeing entity, a demand for review must be filed in the first instance. There are a number of exceptions provided by statute, however. Moreover, where the appeal concerns a failure to act, either an objection or a demand for review may be used at the discretion of the petitioner. An objection or demand for review must be filed within 60 days of receiving notice of the act in question, and within one year of the act itself (the one-year limit may be extended upon showing of cause). There is no time limit on filing appeal of an inaction. All substantive portions of these procedures are conducted in writing, although parties may be called to give oral testimony as part of the process. Injunctions An appeal petition does not ordinarily stop the government from continuing the act in question. However, there are two situations where the government may be enjoined from further action: # In a demand for review, the overseeing entity may voluntarily order the deciding entity to suspend execution of its decision pending resolution of the appeal. This injunction may be issued unilaterally or at the request of the petitioner. # An injunction must be granted by an overseeing entity if necessary to avoid grave harm to the petitioner as a result of the decision; however, if the injunction would cause major effects on the public welfare, the injunction may be withheld. Decision The response to an objection is called a , and the response to a demand for review is called a . In either case, there may be one of four results: # is decided when the appeal has procedural flaws, such as when it is provided in an incorrect format or outside the prescribed time frame. # is decided when the appeal is procedurally sound, but when there is no factual reason to support the appeal. #A decision or ruling is issued where the appeal has merit, but where overturning the decision would cause major harm to the public. This has the same effect as dismissal on the merits. #Otherwise, of the appeal is issued. Should the appeal be accepted, the act in question may be overturned in whole or in part and any past enforcement may be declared invalid (and the appellant restored to their pre-enforcement position). The act may also be amended to the extent necessary to make it legal. If an appeal of an inaction is accepted, the non-acting entity must act promptly following the acceptance of the appeal.

Plot  Summary of Toofan aur Diya The film depicts a period in our society, not so long past, when the postcard was a trusted and cheap means of communication and the cycle the most common mode of commuting ;when people were sensitive to the sufferings of others in their neighborhood and faith was the rule rather than exception in social relationships . The film relates the inspiring story of a boy ,Sadanand and his sister Nandini who endeavor to live with honor after their father(poet Milind Madhav) died in penury. Many people who were uprooted from familiar surroundings following partition of the country and had to endure numerous struggles to survive , rebuild their lives and bring up their families in new surroundings will be able to identify themselves with the travails of Sadanand and his sister. The boy, aptly called Sadanand , is ever cheerful and active and assumes the responsibility of his sister and their sick mother.The boy sacrifices his studies to do several odd jobs -selling vegetables, newspapers, carrying luggage at railway station etc.- while his simple and sensitive elder sister Nandini chips in with preparing and feeding lunch to a few regulars who conduct themselves more like family members than customers. The regulars include young Satish Sharma (called Masterji by Sadanand) a college student with scholarly inclinations. A mutual affection develops between Masterji and Nandini which is a regular topic of playful banter between the siblings. The film opens with Masterji being presented with a gold medal for his literary essay on the poetic works of late Milind Madhav. Masterji shares the happy tidings with Chachiji (widow of the deceased poet )who is moved to tears seeing on the gold medal the image of her late husband who never got recognition for his works and had to battle with poverty throughout his life. Sometime thereafter, Masterji having completed his course, decides to take up employment nearer to his native village so as to help his father who has run into debt for educating him. Chachiji tells him that her end is nearing and requests him to marry Nandini so that she can die peacefully . However, Masterji is not ready to marry as he has three unmarried younger sisters at home and takes leave wishing well for Nandini‚Äôs marriage into a good family. When their mother dies, the siblings decide to move away from painful memories associated with the familiar surroundings and sell away their meager possessions including their father‚Äôs collection of books and Sadanand‚Äôs beloved(‚Äúpyari‚Äù) cycle to settle their debts. They leave the town and take shelter in a remote temple with the permission of a Sanyasi who meditates there in seclusion. Assured that her sister is safe with the holy man around, Sadanand goes daily to the nearby town selling vegetables door to door to earn a living . One day, he comes across Alkaji , a dancer whose luggage he had earlier carried at the railway station.She takes an instant liking for him as she sees the likeness of her own son in Sadanand . She assures him that she will be the first customer of whatever wares he sells and asks him to visit her regularly. One day when Sadanand asks why her son is not staying with her, the dancer confides that she sends money regularly for his upkeep in a different town and if she keeps him with her, she will have to live in poverty as she will not be able to pursue her dancing business.This upsets Sadanand who walks away saying he will come back only when her son comes to live with her. Knowing the mutual affection between Nandini and Masterji, Sadanand writes regularly to Masterji to keep him informed of their welfare.However, the course of life does not run smooth for them as Nandini who has been long complaining of watering in her eyes, becomes blind. Sadanand is devastated with grief and guilt when he learns this. He holds himself responsible for not arranging timely medical treatment for her and runs to jump into the river. The holy man saves him in time and reprimands him for trying to run away from the problem. He assures him that Nandini will recover her sight with treatment as she was not born blind. With monetary help from the kindly dancer, Sadanand gets the operation done and Nandini recovers her eyesight. While they are still rejoicing over this, news comes that Masterji is bedridden with typhoid in a nearby town and there is no one to take care of him. Sadanand rushes there to learn that his condition is serious and he needs urgent treatment with some costly medicines. With self belief and faith in God , he toils day and night and arranges the medicines and Masterji recovers. Masterji and Nandini get married in the temple and after a tearful departure of the newly wed couple , Sadanand bursts out crying that he is now left all alone. The holy man assures him that he is not alone as his sense of purpose, selfless dedication and determination have compelled a Sanyasi to willingly give up his ‚Äú Sanyas ‚Äú. He will now take care of Sadanand so that he completes his studies as he foresees that Sadanand is destined to achieve great accomplishments for the country in future. The film ends with a grateful and beaming Sadanand hugging the holy man. While Sadanand is away to take care of Masterji, Alkaji , the dancer goes to the temple looking for him . Learning that he is away, she asks the Sanyasi to inform Sadanand that he has helped a woman gone astray to mend her ways and reform and she is leaving the town to live with her son. It is an inspiring film with an absorbing story, with the young protagonist‚Äôs role well enacted by child actor Satish Vyas. Nanda does justice to her role as Nandini and so do the actors playing the roles of Sanyasi and Alkaji. Rajendra Kumar is alright in his limited appearance as Masterji. It should be a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù for all people, especially youngsters, as it inspires people to be upright and conscientious in performing their duties and not to lose heart when faced with setbacks but to face them with determination and faith in God. The lyrics by Bharat Vyas and music by Vasant Desai only add to the inspirational and sublime tenor of the story. The film‚Äôs title song ( nirbhal ki ladayi balwaanse - - )soulfully rendered by the inimitable Manna De, recurs several times during the film highlighting the exigent situation the protagonist is faced with. The song will continue to ring in your ears long after the film has ended conveying the sublime message of hope and belief that with determination, unstinting efforts and faith in God , no adversity is impossible to overcome.

It consists of undergraduate students who are attending at NJIT, majoring in civil engineering, and also members of ASCE. Every year, the team competes against other schools in a steel bridge competition. Every year, the team has a few fund raising events, which are very crucial for the competition because the team needs to have proper finance in order to order parts and fabricate them. Besides fund raising, sponsors from other corporates and companies are very important too. A lot of time the team members get together and have outside activities such as hiking, paint ball, go cart, or whatever anyone wants to do. The team also does many productive activities such as visiting high schools and talking about civil engineering and the steel bridge competition. There is at least a meeting every week talking about the process of the team and keeping members informed. Meetings are always held during common hours. Sometimes pizzas and drinks are served.  The competition  The objective of the competition is to design a light bridge yet strong and economically and assembly it fast with as few team members as possible. The competition has 3 processes: Design & testing, which students do that themselves using programs, knowledges they learned from classes, and sometimes help from professors and alumni; Fabrication, which is when students grind, weld, and fit the parts together; and finally Assembly, which is when students put the parts together to achieve the designed bridge. There are 6 categories in scoring: Display (how the bridge look), construction speed (time management), construction economy (low cost to build), lightness, stiffness (aggregate deflection), and structural efficiency (a formula used to calculate this based on weight and deflection). The competition occurs every year. It is hosted at different places every time. This year, 2008, the regional competition will be hosted at Polytechnic Institute of NYU, New York City, on Saturday April 4, 2009; and the national competition will be hosted at University of Nevada, Las Vegas on May 22 and May 23.

The American Civil War era camp was established in 1863 as a depot for the Union Army during the Civil War. It became a recruiting ground for new soldiers from Eastern Tennessee and enslaved people, many of whom had fled their living conditions to be soldiers.Strecker p. 39. On October 26, 2018, President Donald Trump proclaimed the site as Camp Nelson National Monument, the 418th unit of the National Park Service (NPS) system. It was renamed to include \\"Heritage\\" in the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed March 12, 2019. The forested portion overlooking Hickman Creek was funded by the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves' Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund. History =Early years= Camp Nelson was established as a supply depot for Union advances into Tennessee. It was named for Major General William \\"Bull\\" Nelson, who had recently been murdered. It was placed near Hickman Bridge, the only bridge across the Kentucky River upriver from the state capital (Frankfort, Kentucky). The site was selected to protect the bridge, to have a base of operations in central Kentucky, and to prepare to secure the Cumberland Gap and eastern Tennessee. The camp was also used as a site to train new soldiers for the Union army. The Kentucky River and Hickman Creek steep palisades contributed to the selection of the site. Only the northern side needed fortifications against Confederate attack since three sides have 400‚Äì500 feet almost vertical steep cliffs .Sears pp. 21-23. Camp Nelson may have been the choice for a central Kentucky depot, but it had disadvantages. When Union Major General Ambrose Burnside attacked the Cumberland Gap and Knoxville, Tennessee, Camp Nelson's distance from the Gap and Knoxville, combined with lack of railroads and the weather, hampered the Union advance.Sears p. 28. Its drawbacks as a well situated supply depot led General William Tecumseh Sherman to prioritize Camp Nelson to take a major role in training 10,000 black soldiers who volunteered there for the U.S. Colored Troops. He advocated this role in response to overall Union commander Ulysses S. Grant who visited Camp Nelson in January 1864. Grant had observed the inadequacies in the overland supply routes employed and leaned toward abandoning it entirely.Sears lxii Despite Grant's misgivings, Camp Nelson continued supplying major battles in 1864 such as Saltville VA I and Saltville VA II, as well as Atlanta for which the site provided 10,000 horses. Recognizing that the Camp Nelson supply depot and the nearby Hickman Bridge were valuable targets for Confederate raider General John Hunt Morgan, Union forces geared up for attacks in July 1863 and June 1864. The most serious threat was mid-June 1864 when Brig. General Speed S. Fry called upon volunteers from among civilian employees. Six hundred were armed and performed guard duty at the northern fortifications around the clock for 6 days. Major C. E. Compton said that due to these civilians, ‚Äúthe depot was saved from capture and destruction.‚Äù = Black History: troops, impressed workers, refugees, and emancipation = Kentucky was one of four slaveholding states not joining the 11 other slaveholding southern states in forming the Confederate States of America which was in a rebellion rooted in decades of disputes over slavery. Kentucky blacks, enslaved and not, men and women, majorly contributed to the Union war effort in Kentucky initially as laborers, but ultimately as soldiers in infantry, artillery, and cavalry. Because Kentucky was a slaveholding state, but not one in rebellion, those escaping could not be included as contrabands as defined by the Confiscation Act of 1861. This law applied to the Confederacy only and declared that if enslaved people are considered property, then the military has the right to not only deny the access to the owner but also to impress these individuals into work. Nonetheless, the Union Army in the state began impressing thousands, initially only of the disloyal or those who had already fled into Union camps. In the case of disloyal or unknown slave holders, wages and subsistence were paid to the enslaved person. Loyal slaveholders were compensated. Specific to Camp Nelson August 1863, Brig. General Jeremiah Boyle, authorized Commander Speed S. Fry to impress enslaved males, ages 16‚Äì45 within 14 counties of Central Kentucky, up to one-third of the owner's workforce. Just as the military contracted to buy food and livestock, likewise it contracted with slave owning Union loyalists to procure enslaved men to labor at Camp Nelson. An example is agent George Denny who impressed Gabriel Burdett from nearby farm of Hiram Burdett. Compensation of $30 per month for each impressed worker went to slave owners. By 1864, some like Gabriel Burdett would eventually enlist in the U.S. Colored Troops. Consequentially, an estimated 3,000 impressed workers were stationed at Camp Nelson in 1863 performing labor-intensive tasks critical to the camp's founding and defense. Starting with fortifying the strategic Hickman Bridge in May, 1863, they aided in the construction of railroads, the northern fortifications and forts, and the 300 buildings. President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 freed the enslaved only in the rebellious 11 states in the Confederacy. The War Department then publicly authorized the recruitment and training of African Americans in these states. Though a slave holding state, Kentucky was not in rebellion, so the proclamation and the military authorization did not apply. Upon enlistment African Americans were emancipated from slavery in exchange for service in the Union Army. Kentucky recruited and trained more that 23,000 of the approximate 200,000 U.S. Colored Troops (USCT), making it the second largest contributor of any state. Camp Nelson was the largest state site with more than 10,000 recruits. Eight regiments were founded at Camp Nelson and five others were stationed there during the war. Recruitment broadside written by Frederick Douglass in 1863 With the goal of enlistment of Kentucky blacks into the Union Army, Lincoln authorized a special census in 1863 which showed 1,650 freemen and 40,000 enslaved males of military age. Given this figure and using the justification that whites were not fulfilling the state's draft quota, pro- slavery Governor Thomas E. Bramlette reluctantly agreed in March 1864 that African-American men in Kentucky were allowed to join the US Army with consent of their owners who received $300. By April, enslaved men, despite the stipulation of owner consent, fled to enlist. The military, when uncertain of the consent, routinely sent men back to their owners. This situation led to a wave of violence as the military allowed squads hired to seize runaways into Camp Nelson. Chief Quartermaster Captain Theron E. Hall reported the site had become a ‚Äúhunting ground for fugitives.‚Äù The army‚Äôs help led to brutality. Owners severed ears and flayed men alive as they were bound to trees. Due to the wave of violence, by June 1864 owners‚Äô consent was no longer required, as ordered by Union Army Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas. alt= Among groups of African- American recruits, the largest arrived between June and October 1864, with 322 men enlisting on a single day on July 25. In May, 1864, the first large group arrived, 250 recruits from Danville, a distance of 16 miles. These groups and others en route to Camp Nelson were subject to harassment and violence. For example, the Danville group ‚Äúwas assailed with stones and the content of revolvers,‚Äù reported Thomas Butler, superintendent of the United States Sanitary Commission. Peter Bruner's attempt to enlist was initially thwarted when he was captured by men unknown to him and jailed in nearby Nicholasville with 24 others seeking USCT enlistment at Camp Nelson. Rev. John Gregg Fee of the American Missionary Association observed that ‚Äúthree of five recruits bore on their bodies marks of cruelty.‚Äù Despite this, army surgeons upon examining recruits found the vast majority to be healthy and very fit to serve. left Families of soldiers and others fleeing slavery seeking refuge at Union camps such as Camp Nelson were referred to as refugees. Unlike the soldiers, the refugees were initially not eligible for emancipation. The army did not have a clear policy for refugees, but they were allowed to establish a shanty village at Camp Nelson. However, on November 22‚Äì25, 1864, District Commander Speed S. Fry, native of Danville, KY, under pressure from slave-owners, reversed this practice. He ordered soldiers to force out under threat of death 400 women and children onto wagons and escort them out of the camp. Fry ordered soldiers to torch the refugee huts. Temperatures that day were well below freezing. The refugees suffered 102 deaths due to exposure and disease. Camp Nelson Chief Quartermaster Theron E. Hall and Reverend John Gregg Fee of the American Missionary Association led a public outcry to newspapers, high ranking Washington officials, and the northern public. Hall gathered testimony from USCT soldiers on the battered conditions of their families and submitted them to Brig. General Stephen G. Burbridge, commander of the District of Kentucky. Burbridge ordered Fry to immediately cease expulsions, allow the families to return, and provide quarters. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Lincoln‚Äôs Secretary of War, followed up with an order that a permanent shelter be established for _all_ refugees, regardless of any family ties to USCT troops. The New York Tribune published a front page account on Nov. 28, 1864 entitled Cruel Treatment of the Wives and Children of U.S. Colored Soldiers. ‚ÄúAt this moment, over four hundred helpless human beings....having been driven from their homes by United States soldiers, are now lying in barns and mule sheds, wandering through the woods....literally starving, for no other crime than their husbands and fathers having thrown aside the manacles of Slavery to shoulder Union muskets.‚Äù By December 1864, the military reversed its policies, and authorized the construction of the Home for Colored Refugees. Included were 16 by 16 foot duplex cottages for families, a mess hall, barracks, a school, teachers‚Äô quarters and a dormitory. Spurred by these events, on March 3, 1865, a Congressional Act was passed that freed the wives and children of the U.S. Colored Troops. This blow to slavery caused the population of the Home to peak at 3,060 by July 1865. This surpassed capacity, and added were 60 army supplied large wall tents as well makeshift housing constructed by the refugees, similar to before the expulsion. An obelisk at the refugee cemetery north of the Interpretive Center honors the memory of about 300 of the refugees who died at Camp Nelson. Some of those perished as a result of the expulsion of November 1864. The two story school was staffed by the American Missionary Association and the Western Freedman's Aid Commission. Two African Americans were included, E. Belle Mitchell and Reverend Gabriel Burdett. Mitchell's stay was brief due to prejudices of other staff. Burdett was also a USCT soldier and assisted Fee in ministry work. Also included were two barracks that became the refugee hospital. Infectious disease was prevalent and some 1300 refugees died at Camp Nelson. Units raised at Camp Nelson are the 5th and 6th U.S. Colored Cavalry (USCC); the 114th, 116th, 119th, and 124th Colored Infantry; and the 13th and 12th United States Colored Heavy Artillery. =Notable engagements of Camp Nelson Colored Troops= Among notable engagements of the 5th and 6th USCC are the Battle of Saltville I and the Battle of Saltville II in southwestern Virginia. Brig. General Stephen G. Burbridge lead the Ill-fated Saltville I, the objective of which was to destroy the Confederate saltworks, which had been fortified by impressed enslaved workers whose owners were compensated. Though Saltville I in October 1864 was a defeat, Colonel James Sanks Brisbin reported his admiration for the bravery and tenacity of the 400 soldiers, noting that he'd been in 27 battles with the white troops and seen none more courageous. Of the colored troops, 10 were killed in action and 37 wounded. Post battle, a scene of criminal violence was unleashed. Soldiers in the 5th USCC and in two companies of the 6th USCC were murdered, totaling 47. Leading these attacks was Champ Ferguson, who after the war was tried in Nashville, TN for War crimes, sentenced to death, and hanged in October 1865. In December 1864, in the successful second assault on Saltville were the 5th and 6th USCC, units which included survivors of the first battle. General George Stoneman and Burbridge engaged General John C. Breckinridge, a Kentuckian and former Vice President, in nearby Marion, VA, outnumbering their opponents by four to one. Breckinridge retreated after two days. Union troops destroyed the saltworks, and considerably damaged neighboring lead mines and railroads. The USCC troops continued to add to their hard-won reputation. The USCC 5th were again subjected to a murderous assault like that of Saltville I in January 1865 in Simpsonville, KY. Assigned to herd about 1,000 cattle from Camp Nelson to Louisville, KY, 80 soldiers of Company E 5th USCC were ambushed by Confederate guerrillas led by Capt. Dick Taylor. First attacked were the 41 soldiers bringing up the rear, most of whom could not fire due to fouled powder. Locals found 15 dead and 20 wounded and reported Taylor's men boasting about murdering 19 Union soldiers. Lt. Colonel Louis H. Carpenter of the 5th documented the names of the guerrillas and urged a prosecution. This never happened. In 2009, a memorial was placed on the site of the ambush. The 6th USCC and the 114th and 116 Colored Infantry were active in General Grant's Appomattox Campaign, March to April 1864. These units took part in the both the siege of Petersburg, VA and of Richmond, VA, the capitol and seat of government of the Confederacy. These soldiers were engaged in the pursuit of Confederate General Robert E. Lee to the Appomattox Courthouse where they witnessed the surrender of the Confederate Army. =White Refugees and Union Troops from East Tennessee= Though Tennessee was officially a state in rebellion, loyalty to the Confederacy was weak in its eastern Appalachian section. This may be attributable to the comparably low rate of enslaved population, which ranged from 3.5 to 11% as opposed to the 40% to 50% in the western part of the state. View this on an 1860 U.S. Census map, which shows this rate for all counties in slave-holding states. Thousands of the destitute from this area came in a constant steam seeking succor at Camp Nelson. Thomas D. Butler, a superintendent of the United States Sanitary Commission, who had as his responsibility their care, described the situation of one refugee family with six children, ‚Äú...the rebels had driven her and her children from their home, and destroyed their property...for many weeks...wandered, homeless, hungry and sick, through cold and stormy weather, to reach Camp Nelson.‚Äù The husband was a discharged Union soldier who was captured en route with the family. He escaped and journeyed to Camp Nelson where the family was reunited. Union loyalist Felix A. Reeve raised and commanded the 8th Tennessee Volunteer Infantry. Several East Tennessee regiments were trained and organized here. * Commanded by Felix A. Reeve, the 8th Tennessee Volunteer Infantry, organized at Camp Dick Robinson and Camp Nelson from November 1862 to August 1863, participated in the Knoxville Campaign and subsequent East Tennessee operations from November 4 to December 23, 1863. * Five companies of the 5th East Tennessee Cavalry (also known as the 8th Tennessee Cavalry) June to August 1863 * The 10th, 12th, 13th Cavalry and Battery E of First Tennessee Light Artillery For a 10-minute video summary of the site's history and significance narrated by Dr. W. Stephen McBride, director of interpretation and archaeology, go to this link. =Post War= After the war, Camp Nelson was a center for giving ex-slaves their emancipation papers. Many have considered the camp as their \\"cradle of freedom\\". The United States Sanitary Commission (USSC) operated a soldiers' home for a time at Camp Nelson, in former barracks. It was one of a series of homes and rest houses they operated for soldiers. Here are some post-war achievements of Camp Nelson U.S. Colored Troops. Angus Burleigh was literate and enlisted at age 16, becoming a sergeant with the 12th Regiment Heavy Artillery U.S. Colored Troops after an escape from an Anderson County farm. In 1875, he was the first black graduate of Berea College as well as the first black adult male to enroll. The college was founded by John Fee and the American Missionary Association in 1855 and students, black and white, were enrolled. He was among blacks from Berea and Oberlin College who taught in Freedman's Schools, conducting a school in Garrard County in 1869. Later he was ordained a Methodist Episcopal minister and held pastorates in several states and served as chaplain to the Illinois State Senate. He lived until 1914 when he was Berea's oldest living graduate. Rev. Elijah P. Marrs 1915 Elijah P. Marrs led 27 others from to Louisville from neighboring Simpsonville, Ky. to join the USCT. Marrs, another sergeant with the 12th US Colored Heavy Artillery, trained at Camp Nelson where he also taught reading. After the war, Marrs taught school and was ordained a Baptist minister. In 1879, he and his brother founded Baptist Normal and Theological Institute in Louisville, which became Simmons Bible College. Marrs was active with the Republican party in Kentucky. His autobiography is downloadable from the University of North Carolina's Documenting the American South Digital Publishing Initiative. Peter Bruner at Miami University in Ohio where he worked. Peter Bruner wrote with his daughter his autobiography, A Slave‚Äôs Adventure Toward Freedom, Not Fiction, but the True Story of a Struggle, also included in the UNC's Documenting the American South. He recounts his frequently made unsuccessful escape attempts and subsequent severe punishments. Another member of the 12th, he enlisted with 16 other men, walking 41 miles from Irvine, Ky. Post war, Bruner moved to Oxford, Ohio and became the first African American to work at Miami University where he also enrolled. In addition to his work as a custodian and messenger, he served as a ceremonial greeter wearing a top hat and tails. He raised five children with his wife Frances Proctor. He is listed on plaque B-26 at the African American Civil War Memorial in Washington DC. His ceremonial top hat is on display at the McGuffey House and Museum of Miami University. Gabriel Burdette while enslaved in neighboring Garrard County became active in the ministry serving at the Forks Dix River Church. He enlisted July 1864 in the 114th U.S. Colored Infantry. He served as a teacher, nurse, and minister, leading in the development of education, housing, and aid for the refugees. He began a 12 year association with John Fee and the American Missionary Association. After serving in both Tennessee and Texas, Burdett returned and was instrumental in establishing Ariel Academy. He became the first African American on the Berea College Board of Trustees, serving 12 years. Involved in the Republican Party, the same party of President Lincoln, he campaigned in the 1872 presidential for the reelection of former Union General Grant. He served as a voting member at both the 1872 and 1876 Republican National Conventions. The violence associated with the 1876 election convinced Burdett to join the Exodusters Movement to the West and emigrate with his family to Kansas. The path of his life is followed in some detail in this account of African Americans‚Äô struggle for freedom during and post Civil War. Recent times alt= alt= Presently, of the original property are preserved as the Camp Nelson Heritage National Monument. Most of the buildings at the camp were sold.[\\"Nelson's stock soars\\"], The Kentucky Civil War Bugle Second Quarter, 2008, pg.1-8 The camp is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and was declared a National Historic Landmark District (NHLD) in March 2013. The site is also part of the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, which runs through several states and has sites in Canada and the Antilles. In a more rural area than the other former USCT recruitment sites, Camp Nelson is the only one whose land was never developed after the war for other purposes. During its existence as Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park, Camp Nelson was controlled by the Jessamine County Fiscal Court. The forested portion overlooking Hickman Creek was funded by the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves' Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund. In August 2017, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke suggested to President Trump that Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park be made into a national monument. On June 5, 2018, the United States House of Representatives approved U.S. Representative Andy Barr's sponsored H.R. 5655, \\"Camp Nelson Heritage National Monument Act\\". On July 26, 2018, a bill, S. 3287, titled the \\"Camp Nelson Heritage National Monument Act\\", was introduced in the United States Senate, aiming at establishing Camp Nelson as a part of the national park system. On August 15, 2018, a national park committee hearing was held regarding the bill, but Congress took no further action on the legislation. On October 26, 2018, President Trump used the Antiquities Act to approve the creation of Camp Nelson National Monument, transferring ownership and management of Camp Nelson to the National Park Service. On March 12, 2019, President Trump signed legislation that renamed the National Monument \\"Camp Nelson Heritage National Monument.\\" The Oliver Perry House is the only surviving structure from its years as a camp. It was built in about 1846 for the newlywed couple of Oliver Perry and the former Fannie Scott. General Burnside confiscated the house during the war to serve as officers quarters. In many official letters, the house was called the \\"White House\\". It currently is operated as a historic house museum for the park.\\"Camp Nelson\\" , Jessamine County, KY official site, accessed November 7, 2008 The park has five miles of walking trails, open dawn to dusk, lining the northern border where remnants of the forts and fortifications are marked with historic signage. Fort Putnam has been reconstructed to the specifications of the original engineering plan. Re- enactors of the USCC 5th fire the site's Napol√©on 12 pound cannon there during the Annual Civil War Heritage Weekend held in mid-September. The date of President Lincoln's death, April 15, 1865, is commemorated with a ceremonial firing at Fort Putnam. The interpretive center is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday with tours available 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Ghost tours are occasionally available. Camp Nelson National Cemetery is one mile to the south. It has organized records of burials online so that families may trace relatives buried here, in addition to those who trained or lived at the camp.

Its capital and administrative center is Oca√±a. The comarca is located in the northeast part of the province, and encompasses an area that includes several hundred meters of the Tajo River Valley. The comarca is bordered on the North by Aranjuez (Las Vegas); to the south by Los Y√©benes and the comarca; to the West by La Sagra and Toledo; and to the East by the Mancha Alta de Toledo and .  Geography  = Geomorphology = The altitude changes radically through the region. The height differences between the escarpments of the banks of the Tajo river to the North versus the steppes of La Guardia, and between the valleys and ravines of the Algodor River to the West and those of the Cedr√≥n River to the East, have given rise the region's nickname of \\"the staircase.\\" The area has a very distinct and unique set of geological formations which set it apart from its neighbors. = Location = The comarca consists of 1,453.49 km2, and contains the following municipalities: Caba√±as de Yepes (17.97 km2), Ciruelos(22.94 km2), Dosbarrios (111.59 km2), La Guardia (195.59 km2), Huerta de Valdecar√°banos (83.00 km2), Noblejas (69.67 km2), Oca√±a (147.91 km2), Ont√≠gola (41.49 km2), Santa Cruz de la Zarza (264.54 km2), Villarrubia de Santiago (155.29 km2), Villasequilla (76.95 km2), Villatobas (181.58 km2), and Yepes (84.97 km2). = Climate = The comarca's climate can be considered continental mediterranean due to its extreme temperatures. Average summer temperatures are over 26 ¬∞C, while winters average less than 6 ¬∞C.  Demographics  According to the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica in 2007, the population of the comarca is 39,175, with an average population density of 26.94 people/km2.

Mesa de Oca√±a has a rich cultural and architectural heritage, not to mention the area's many archeological treasures which document the lives of various different cultures who settled the area throughout the centuries. One of the most spectacular of these architectural treasures is the \\"Plaza de Moros\\" in Villatobas, an Iron Age village whose walls are covered in murals. The ancient town of Oca√±a itself is considered a historical monument in and of itself. The town of Yepes was an ecclesiastical dominion during the rule of the archbishop of Toledo, and is now a historical and artistic monument. The towns which make up the comarca share two common characteristics: a plethora of religious architecture and the remains of ancient medieval fortifications. The many religious buildings -- churches, monasteries, convents, and hermitages‚Äîare reminders of bygone days of military orders and ecclesiastical dominions. Old defensive buildings include castles in Ont√≠gola and Dosbarrios, the ruins of the castle in Valdecar√°banos, and the fortress in La Guardia.  Handicrafts  The local handicrafts are very traditional and varied. These include pottery, a legacy of the Moors, which is popular in Oca√±a, Villarrubia de Santiago, Santa Cruz de la Zarza, and Villamuelas. Ironwork, carpentry, wickerwork, basketweaving, cooperage and crafting with glass and ebony, along with the production of wineskins are all popular traditional trades.  Cuisine  Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. The cuisine of Mesa de Oca√±a is typical of Castilla-La Mancha, with many game-based dishes, especially partridge. Other traditional dishes include various types of roasts, lamb stew, gachas, migas, , hare, and cuchifritos. Popular desserts include a wide range of sweets and pastries, including , puff pastries, and borrachos de Oca√±a (literally \\"the drunks of Oca√±a\\"). In terms of wine, the comarca is a part of the Denominaci√≥n de Origen La Mancha, and its wineries enjoy the same international acclaim as those of . The most- developed winemaking municipalities include Villamuelas, Oca√±a, Yepes, Villarrubia de Santiago, Santa Cruz de la Zarza, and Noblejas.

Early days Curtis was born in Barnstaple, Devon, the youngest of four brothers. His paternal grandfather, a Norman by the name of Courtois, had settled at Barnstaple many years previously. Like his brothers, Curtis worked as a garden boy at the local Bale's Nursery. On completing his education, Curtis joined James Veitch & Sons' Royal Exotic Nursery at Chelsea, London in 1874, where he received his botanical training in the \\"New Plant Department\\". Plant hunting In 1878, Harry Veitch despatched him to Mauritius and Madagascar, from where he sent seeds of Nepenthes madagascariensis, a species of pitcher plant, and various other tropical plants, including Angraecum sesquipedale. Unfortunately, following \\"treachery\\" by one of the African helpers, who cut the rope which held the raft on which the plants were being floated downriver, the first consignment of plants collected was lost and, as a result, the collecting work had to be repeated. Marianne North's painting of Nepenthes northiana, showing a lower and an upper pitcher Curtis returned to England in 1879, but a year later was sent to the Dutch East Indies, where he explored Borneo, Sumatra, Java and the Moluccas. Veitch instructed him to collect specimens of Nepenthes northiana, which had been discovered by Marianne North in Borneo, although the precise locality where the plant grew was unknown. On the trip to Borneo, Curtis was accompanied by a young gardener, David Burke, who later became a plant collector himself. The search for the elusive pitcher plant was unsuccessful, but the pair discovered many other species, including many interesting stove (hot-house) plants, palms, and orchids. At the end of the trip, Curtis accompanied Burke to Singapore, from where Burke returned to England with the collection of plants, including large consignments of the slipper orchids, Paphiopedilum stonei and P. lowii, as well as many Vandas, Rhododendrons, and the beautiful foliage plant for British hot-houses, Leea amabilis. Paphiopedilum superbiens From Singapore, Curtis travelled to Pontianak in Dutch Borneo, with the special object of obtaining a consignment of Phalaenopsis violacea, then known in England but still rare. He was successful in locating the plant, but again, owing to a mishap with the boat, a month's collections and all his clothes and instruments were lost, and he narrowly escaped with his life. In 1882, Curtis eventually located Nepenthes northiana in Borneo and sent seeds back to Chelsea, as well as N. stenophylla and seed from a plant that became known as N. curtisii, although now known as N. maxima. Curtis was not meticulous in recording where he located individual plants ‚Äì although it was originally believed that he collected N. curtisii in Borneo, Charles Clarke points out that he also visited Sulawesi on the same trip, and N. maxima is common there.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. He also sent back the orchid which was originally named Paphiopedilum curtisii, although now known as a synonym for Paphiopedilum superbiens; Curtis did not reveal where he found the plants, other than saying that this was in Sumatra. According to the account in Hortus Veitchii, Curtis had been commissioned to go in search of Nepenthes northiana, and > \\"after long and unsuccessful effort, Curtis gave up hope, under the > impression that Miss North had been wrongly informed, but fortunately before > leaving the district it occurred to him to look over a steep escarpment in > the hill-side, accomplished by lying prostrate on the ground, when to his > great joy he discovered the long-looked-for plant some distance below. He > succeeded in gathering ripe capsules, and lost no time in transmitting them > to Chelsea, where the seed soon germinated\\", and was introduced in the James Veitch & Sons catalogue in 1883. Other plants introduced to England by Curtis, include two species of Vireya rhododendron ‚Äì Rhododendron multicolor (with the red variety Curtisii named after him) and R. teysmannii (now considered to be subspecies of R. javanicum) ‚Äì before he terminated his engagement with Veitch early in 1884. Honours Nepenthes maxima Amongst the many plant species named after Curtis in recognition of his services to botany and horticulture were the following: *Acanthephippium curtisii *Cirrhopetalum curtisii *Gastrochilus curtisii *Luisia curtisii *Medinilla curtisii *Nepenthes curtisii (subsequently synonymised with Nepenthes maxima) *Paphiopedilum curtisii (subsequently synonymised with Paphiopedilum superbiens) *Pentace curtisii *Rhododendron multicolor var. curtisii *Shorea curtisii (dark red meranti) He was also honoured by the genus Curtisina, but the only member of the genus, Curtisina penangensis, was subsequently identified as a taxonomic synonym of Dacryodes longifolia. Penang Botanic Gardens In mid-1884, following a recommendation from Kew Gardens, Curtis was appointed to the position as Assistant Superintendent of Forests and Gardens under the Straits Settlements administration. Curtis reported to a Superintendent, Nathaniel Cantley, who was also the Curator of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Curtis was placed in charge of the Penang region of the Forest and Gardens Department, which included the \\"Waterfall Gardens\\", together with some 3,575 ha of forest reserves. The forest reserves included areas reserved for recreational, fuel, forestry harvesting and protection purposes, mostly on Penang Island. The Forests and Gardens Department was initially engaged mainly in the cultivation of essential commercial plants, inspecting crops and advising the planting community. When the department's work in connection with economic crops and forestry was taken over by the Agriculture and Forestry Departments, Curtis was appointed the first superintendent of the newly re-created Penang Botanic Gardens,Simon Gardner, Pindar Sidisunthorn and Lai Ee May, 2011. Heritage Trees of Penang. Penang: Areca Books. responsible for the layout of the gardens, and their transformation from an old granite quarry site. The Gardens, as distinct from the Forest Reserves, became Curtis' passion. Curtis was presented with a tropical valley, including a nutmeg plantation with associated structures, and a prominent location on the trail to and at the foot of the \\"Great Waterfall\\". While an avid and acknowledged botanist and plant collector, he proved himself to be a creative landscape designer in crafting the design and development of the Gardens. On accepting the position, Curtis proposed a long term strategy as to the development of the gardens and its potential role as a botanical repository and clearing house. Curtis' immediate actions were to develop a plant nursery and undertake a programme of works to create a pleasurable recreational and botanical garden in the valley. This vision was spelt out in detail in his 1885 annual report to Cantley as part of the Department's Annual Report. This included proposals to extend and develop the existing \\"Waterfall Gardens\\", the construction of road circuits, the erection of plant-houses for the propagation and cultivation of various species, and the provision of recreational venues. His immediate steps in 1885-86 were focussed upon increasing the area of the Gardens in the valley together with improving road and pedestrian access. In his 1885 report, Curtis commented on \\"the poor gravelly soil in the valley\\" which required that considerable attention should be given to the preparation of the ground for tree planting. However, the \\"natural advantages of the surroundings, from a landscape gardening point of view, ... in a great measure compensate for this defect.\\" From the outset, Curtis introduced aesthetic considerations into the design of the Gardens, through the strategic placement of trees and the clearance of jungle. The circular road circuits he had constructed carefully weave through the valley opening up views, framing vantage points, and providing surprises to the visitor. Curtis' design was motivated by his objective to take advantage of and exploit the natural landscape in the first instance, and then locate plantings in functional or species family associations. A later curator, Frederick Sydney Banfield, observed of the planting design structure established by Curtis that: \\"There is little systematic arrangement even in the botanical sections, the principal aim having been to arrange the plants in such a way as to enhance the natural beauty of the Gardens\\". On short leaves of absence he made collections of both living and herbarium specimens at Penang, Burma and neighbouring coastal areas. On some of the trips he was accompanied by Henry Nicholas Ridley, superintendent of The Singapore Botanic Gardens. Both men were interested in the development of the rubber industry, and experiments they made in Penang proved exceedingly valuable to planters. Curtis' health began to deteriorate from 1890 onwards. He took leave of absence from Penang \\"on account of ill-health\\" from 26 January to 25 December 1891. Curtis blamed his ill-health on the quality and location of the accommodation made available to him. Returning in December 1891, Curtis spent another five months at the quarters \\"during which the health of myself and family suffered severely from fever\\" forcing him to vacate the house and rent accommodation elsewhere. His 1892 Annual Report includes \\"A list of the more important Plants and Trees flowered in the Botanic Gardens, Penang, 1892\\", and provides an extensive review of the flowering species in the Gardens' collection. Two years later he published \\"An Extensive Catalogue of Flowering Plants and Ferns Found Growing Wild in the island of Penang\\" in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society: containing 1,971 species of 793 genera and 129 natural orders, it is a significant record of Malaysian flora. Curtis also maintained his professional association with the Veitch family during his tenure as Assistant Superintendent. Often forwarding specimens to their nursery, he always visited them while on leave in England, and James Herbert Veitch reported on the Gardens during a visit in 1896, as part of an extensive tour of inspection of South East Asian and Australasian botanic gardens and public gardens, in his \\"Traveller's Notes\\" (1896). In March 1903, Curtis took early long service leave due to a \\"complete breakdown in February\\" from fever. Walter Fox was appointed Superintendent on 7 December 1903, \\"the date of Mr Curtis's retirement\\". Following his appointment, Fox reflected that Curtis' administration was one of important developments in Penang: > \\"In Curtis's retirement the Government loses an able conscientious and > hardworking officer. It falls to the lot of few men on their retirement to > leave their life's work in so visible and concrete a form. Eighteen years > ago the site of the present beautiful Gardens was practically a waste > ground. It is now the pride of the Colony and the admiration of all who > visit it\\". Ridley recorded in 1910 that \\"Mr Curtis was a man full of energy and skill as a landscape gardener and was not to be daunted by difficulties\\". Retirement Following his retirement, his main herbarium was transferred to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Curtis returned to England, settling in his native town of Barnstaple, in Devon, where he spent his retirement tending his own collection of peach trees, carnations, orchids, sweet peas, streptocarpus, and meconopsis in a garden close to Barnstaple Victoria Road railway station. In the summer of 1928 he fell ill and in need of an operation in hospital. For a while it appeared as though he might make a full recovery, but five weeks after surgery, on 23 August, he died at his home at Barnstaple.

As Director of the Model Water Code Project, he led in the drafting of the Appropriative Rights Model Water Code and the Regulated Riparian Model Water Code, and supervised the preparation of Model Agreements for Sharing and Use of Transboundary Waters and Model Water Regulations for Administration and Trading in Humid Areas. As Rapporteur, he led the revision of the Helsinki Rules, the generally recognized summary of the customary international law on water resources, a revision that resulted in the International Law Association's approval in August 2004 of the Berlin Rules on Water Resources to replace the Helsinki Rules. He has served as chair of the Water Regulatory Standards Committee of the Environment and Water Resources Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers since 1996 and as Vice-Chair of the Standards Development Council of the Institute since 2006. He also is co-chair of the Committee on International Environmental Law of the Section of International Law and Practice of the American Bar Association.  International and Comparative Law  Dellapenna has taught and practiced extensively in the area of international and comparative law. Among the courses he has taught in this area are: Admiralty, Chinese Law, Comparative Law, Conflicts of Law (Private International Law), Law of the Sea, Public International Law, and Transnational Litigation, as well as the already mentioned courses on International Trade and the Environment and on Ocean and Coastal Law. He has represented clients, consulted with attorneys and governments, and served as an expert witness in litigation in the United States and other countries. He is particularly well known as an expert on foreign state immunity and works frequently on such cases. His book, Suing Foreign Governments and Their Corporations (1st ed., The Bureau of National Affairs: Washington, DC 1988; 2nd ed., Transnational Publishers: Ardsley, NY 2003) was described by one book reviewer as the \\"bible\\" for liti¬¨gation under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. The book was cited by both Justice David Souter (writing for the majority) and Justice John Paul Stevens (writing in dissent) in Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.S. 349 (1993), as well as in numerous lower courts, as authoritative for the interpretation of the Act. He has also written numerous other articles on the above topics. Perhaps Dellapenna's most noteworthy litigation was as co-counsel for the family of Raoul Wallenberg in a case brought by Wallenberg's half-brother, Guy von Dardel. Von Dardel v. U.S.S.R., 623 F. Supp. 246 (D.D.C. 1985). Although the judgment subsequently was vacated, 736 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1990), the Soviet government then opened its records to the family regarding Wallenberg's fate, resulting in a report jointly released by the Swedish and Russian governments in 2000 confirming Wallenberg's murder in 1947. Dellapenna's work on this case was recognized with his award of the Wallenberg medal by the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation in 2008. His work was also featured prominently in a book about Wallenberg and the efforts to secure his release: Alan Gersten, A Conspiracy of Indifference: The Raoul Wallenberg Story 200-82 (2001). Dellapenna chaired the Committee on International Litigation of the Section of International Law and Practice of the American Bar Association from 1993-1995 and the Section's Committee on Chinese Law from 1995-1999. He was a member of the Working Group of the Section of International Law and Practice of the American Bar Association that drafted a proposed set of amendments to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that the Association's House of Delegates approved in 2002. Other Fields of Law: Dellapenna has also taught several courses on contracts and commercial law and occasionally serves as an attorney in such cases. This includes more than 20 years in teaching basic contracts. He has also developed a special interest in the history of abortion and abortion law in England and America. This led to his book, Dispelling the Myths of Abortion History (Carolina Academic Press: 2006), a book that several reviewers has described as \\"definitive\\". He has also presented amicus briefs on the history of abortion in three cases before the Supreme Court of the United States and several lower courts.  Honors  Dellapenna was awarded the Raoul Wallenberg Medal by the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation for his work on litigation seeking to determine what became of Wallenberg, a hero of the holocaust who disappeared after World War II. He has also been selected as a distinguished lecturer several times.

By April 1944 a large number of the committee members were arrested by the German security agencies. History The original initiative to form the committee came from the Estonian former pre-plebiscite of 1933 opposition parties and it denied the constitutional authority of J√ºri Uluots, the last pre-war Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia. The Committee aimed to establish a provisional government, during the German withdrawal expected as the Red Army had reached the border of Estonia on February 2, 1944. On 1 August 1944 the \\"committee\\" declared itself even the bearer of the supreme power of State (instead of people). The Committee succeeded in establishing a communication network with the Estonian diplomats in Finland and Sweden. In response to this unconstitutional \\"committee\\", on 20 April 1944, J√ºri Uluots convened the Electoral Committee of the Republic of Estonia (Vabariigi Presidendi Aset√§itja Valimiskogu, the institution specified in the Constitution for electing the Acting President of the Republic),https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Estonian_Republic_(1938) Art. 46. which held a clandestine meeting in Tallinn. The participants included: *J√ºri Uluots, the last Prime Minister of Estonia before the Soviet occupation, appointed 12 October 1939, *Johan Holberg, the acting Commander- in-Chief of the Armed Forces, appointed 1 December 1943, *Otto Pukk, the Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, elected 17 October 1939, *Alfred Maurer, the Second deputy Vice-Chairman of the National Council, elected 21 April 1938, *Mihkel Klaassen, Chairman off the Administrative Department of the State Court of Estonia, appointed 26 September 1938. The Committee determined that the Soviet-era appointment of Johannes Vares as Prime Minister by Konstantin P√§ts had been illegal and that Uluots had assumed the President's duties from June 21, 1940 onwards.L.

Thus some members of the \\"national committee\\" became now members of the constitutional government. On 20 September 1944, Uluots departed for Sweden. Tief assumed office in accordance with the constitution and took the opportunity, with the departure of the Germans, to declare the legitimate Estonian government restored. Most of members of this government left from Tallinn on 21 September and Tief on 22 September. As reported by the Royal Institute of International Affairs at the time, the Estonian national government was proclaimed in Estonia and Estonian military units seized the national government buildings in Toompea Castle and ordered the German forces to leave.By Royal Institute of International Affairs. Information Dept. Published 1945 The flag of Germany was replaced with the flag of Estonia in the Pikk Hermann tower of Toompea. Tief‚Äôs government, however, failed to stay in power as Estonian military units led by Johan Pitka clashed with both Germans and Soviets. On 22 September, the Soviet Leningrad Front took control of Tallinn. Most of the members and officials including Tief were caught, jailed, deported, or executed. Tief managed to survive a decade in Siberia and, after return from deportation, died in 1976. Kaarel Liidak, Minister of Agriculture, died in hiding on 16 January 1945. After Uluots died on January 9, 1945 in Sweden, August Rei, as the most senior surviving member of the government, assumed the role of acting head of state. Rei was supported by the surviving members of the Tief's government in Sweden. Rei was the last Estonian envoy in Moscow before the Soviet annexation and had managed to escape from Moscow through Riga to Stockholm in June 1940.Diplomats Without a Country By James T.

He is remembered best for his 1941 novel Hold Autumn in Your Hand, which won the National Book Award and the Texas Institute of Letters award in 1941. In 1945, French director Jean Renoir directed The Southerner, based on Hold Autumn in Your Hand, starring Zachary Scott and Beulah Bondi. The critical praise and comparisons to John Steinbeck established Perry as one of the top writers of his era. Early days Born in Rockdale, Texas, he was the only son of Andrew Perry, a businessman who owned the local drug store, and Laura Perry. After the death of his father in 1922 and the suicide of his mother a year later, George lived with his maternal grandmother Mai Van de Venter, whom he later immortalized in his book My Granny Van, and his Uncle Perry. He spent a year at Southwestern University in nearby Georgetown, the first of three attempts at a college education that included stints at Southwestern, Purdue and the University of Houston, never earning a degree. At Southwestern he met Claire Hodges, daughter of a Beaumont medical doctor. Career In 1931, he returned from traveling abroad to marry Claire and move back to Rockdale. Insulated from the worst effects of the Great Depression by a small inherited income, Perry spent the next six years writing six novels and more than 50 short stories about rural and small-town Texas and the semifeudal system of tenant farming that prevailed at the time. Claire Perry acted as his typist, grammarian, and audience. In 1937, The Saturday Evening Post published one of his stories, and soon thereafter Doubleday published his first book Walls Rise Up, a comic novel about three vagrants living along the Brazos River. In 1941, Perry firmly established his place on the Texas literary scene with Hold Autumn in Your Hand, a novel about a year in the life of a tenant farmer, perhaps the best agrarian novel about Texas. The book won the Texas Institute of Letters \\"Book of the Year\\" award in 1941 and became the first Texas book to win the National Book Award. The novel also was named Bookseller Discovery of 1941, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. According to The New York Times, the Discovery was \\"a sort of consolation prize that the booksellers hope will draw attention to his work\\"; 7,000 copies had been sold. \\"Neglected Author Gets High Honor: 1941 Book Award Presented to George Perry for Hold Autumn In Your Hand, The New York Times, February 11, 1942, page 18. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851-2007). The Discovery was the only National Book Award for 1941 books and the last before the awards were re-established for 1949 books. George and Claire Perry acquired a second home in Guilford, Connecticut in the late 1940s. He became one of the most popular writers in the nation in the postwar period as a correspondent for The Saturday Evening Post, particularly with the series \\"Cities of America\\" and \\"Families of America.\\" To the consternation of many of his fans and literary critics, however, he never returned to novels. In declining physical and mental health in his later years, he disappeared on December 13, 1956 after walking into a river near his home there; his body was recovered February 13, 1957 in a small stream and a coroner's inquest ruled accidental drowning.\\"Perry, George Sessions\\".

McDonald (died May 10, 2005) was a provincial court judge in Manitoba, Canada. He resigned in 1993, following controversy about racist and sexist statements he had made from the bench. Early career McDonald became a judge in Portage la Prairie in 1962. He was criticized in 1987 for issuing only a $500 fine in a drunk driving case that resulted in a man's death.\\"$500 FINE IN MAN'S DEATH GALLS SISTERS\\", Toronto Star, 7 July 1987, A9. By the 1990s, he was one of the last small-town resident judges in the province.Randy Turner, \\"Accused love 'big pussycat'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 May 1993. Controversy Three of McDonald's rulings in 1992-93 attracted widespread attention and condemnation. In August 1992, he declined a request for assistance from a woman who worked in the same office as her ex-boyfriend, whom she accused of harassment. McDonald was quoted as saying, \\"Ever thought of quitting work?\\".Ruth Teichrob, \\"Judge downplays sex crime, cites offender's 'curiosity'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 April 1993. A few months later, the Winnipeg Free Press reported that McDonald declined a woman's request for a peace bond, and told her to \\"work something out\\" with the man she accused of assaulting her. The woman, a resident of the Sandy Bay Indian Reserve, said that she was humiliated by the experience, and that McDonald's comments made it seem as though she was at fault. Advocates for abused women said the incident made a mockery of Manitoba's zero tolerance rules against domestic violence.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Judge refuses peace bond\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 March 1993; \\"NDP calls for removal of judge\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 March 1993. McDonald's decision was overturned in May 1993. See Ruth Teichrob, \\"Judge rules peace bond refusal wrong\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 May 1993. In April 1993, McDonald ruled that a 73-year-old man who pleaded guilty to sexual assault against four of his relatives was motivated by \\"curiosity\\", and sentenced him to two years' probation. In response, several critics argued that McDonald was insensitive to issues of abuse. Ann McGillvray of the University of Manitoba said that his approach was \\"40 years out of date\\" and that he stood out \\"like a sore thumb\\" in Manitoba's judicial system. Provincial Justice Minister James McCrae announced a review into McDonald's sentence, and ordered the Manitoba Judicial Council to launch a broader review into McDonald's activities.Ruth Teichrob, \\"McCrae vows to hold judge accountable for abuse stand\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 April 1993; Ruth Teichrob, \\"Judge faces review over complaints\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 May 1993. McCrae also announced that he would overhaul the Judicial Council and introduce provincial legislation to ensure the better screening of judicial applicants.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Screening committee must approve judges\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 May 1993; Ruth Teichrob, \\"McCrae planning to overhaul judicial watchdog\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 June 1993. In June 1993, the appeals court overturned and denounced McDonald's ruling, and issued a six-month jail term against the defendant.Kevin Rollason, \\"Appeal court denounces sentencing remarks\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 June 1993. Further investigative reporting by the Winnipeg Free Press revealed that McDonald was known in the legal community for granting discharges in sexual assault cases. He frequently berated Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers for minor technical errors, and kept personal records on accused persons who appeared before him. Several lawyers refused to criticize him on the record, fearing repercussions if they appeared again in his courtroom. McDonald was suspended on May 11, 1993, after chief provincial judge Kris Stefanson reviewed a transcript of remarks that he made in a December 1969 court hearing. During this case, McDonald said he was \\"distressed\\" that residents of the Long Plains Indian Band had refused to cooperate with the RCMP, and expressed \\"hope\\" that they would not receive RCMP help if they ever needed it. He then added, \\"[the] joyful result would be that the residents of the reserve would kill one another off\\". In the same transcript, McDonald said, \\"I am well aware of the fact that there is more violence on Indian reserves than anywhere else in the country. I am well aware of the fact that when an Indian [...] fights, (he) doesn't fight, he tries to massacre somebody. The amount of damage inflicted on various complainants is considerable, and if it weren't for the fact that most of them have the thickest skulls in the country, there would be many more possibilities of murder charges that would be incapable of being proved because all the witnesses hadn't seen anything.\\"Ruth Teichrob, \\"Controversial judge suspended while conduct reviewed\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 May 1993. These remarks were widely condemned, with Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs leader Phil Fontaine saying that he was outraged by McDonald's behaviour.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Judge pays price, but it took 23 years\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 May 1993; Ruth Teichrob, \\"Silence protected rough-hewn judge\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 June 1993. As the scandal unfolded, it was reported that several complaints had been filed against McDonald in the previous decades. A transcript of McDonald's remarks was reportedly sent to chief provincial judge Harold Gyles after the 1969 case, although Gyles said that he never received the document.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Gyles, McDonald cross paths several times\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 December 1993. In 1978, Crown Attorney Bob Maxwell submitted a complaint alleging that McDonald showed bias against aboriginal Canadians, made derogatory remarks made from the bench, and was generally rude and unprofessional in his behaviour.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Exasperated, critics gave up\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 June 1993. It was also alleged that McDonald once ruined a drug surveillance operation by talking about it in a coffee shop. Portions of this complaint were submitted to provincial Attorney-General Gerald Mercier and later forwarded to Gyles, who reprimanded McDonald in private and requested that he give up control of the docket to the Crown.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Objections began in '69\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 June 1993. McDonald complied, and a senior official in the Attorney-General's department described the matter as resolved. During this period, Gyles also told Mercier that a public inquiry would cause adverse publicity.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Memo says McDonald had mended ways\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 June 1993; Ruth Teichrob, \\"I want it to be over: Gyles\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 December 1993. Gyles later accused Maxwell of having ulterior motives in filing the complaint, a charge that Maxwell denied. See Ruth Teichrob, \\"I never got transcript: Gyles\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 December 1993. Gyles later said that he did not investigate other complaints against McDonald during this period because they were not made in writing. Gord Mackintosh, opposition critic for the New Democratic Party, said that this explanation was not acceptable.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Ex-chief judge sparks new calls for investigation\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 December 1993. In 1987, the Manitoba Advisory Council on the Status of Women filed a complaint to Attorney-General Roland Penner about McDonald's handling of sexual assault cases. Penner referred MACSW to the Manitoba Judicial Council. Gyles, who served on the council, investigated the matter and sent McDonald a letter of admonition.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Panel notes women's 'sensitivity'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 June 1993; Ruth Teichrob, \\"I want it to be over: Gyles\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 December 1993. Several complaints about McDonald were later submitted between 1988 and 1993.Ruth Teichrob, \\"File on McDonald grows thick in five years\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 June 1993. Aftermath McDonald resigned in December 1993, just as the Judicial Council was about to begin an investigation into his activities.

It begins in Ratchathewi district at Sam Liam Din Daeng Junction, where it intersects with Din Daeng Road and Ratchaprarop Road, and runs northwest, past Victory Monument Circle, through Dusit district, and ultimately crossing the Chao Phraya River on Krung Thon Bridge and ending in Bang Phlat district at Bang Phlat Intersection, where it intersects with Sirindhorn Road and Charan Sanitwong Road. Ratchawithi Road was formerly known as Sang Hi Road (). It was originally constructed during the reign of King Chulalongkorn, as one of three new roads constructed at the time Dusit Palace was built, along with Lok Road (, now Rama V Road) and Duang Tawan Road (, now Si Ayutthaya Road). The name \\"Sang Hi\\" comes from Chinese, and means \\"exceedingly happy\\". The original road stretched only from behind Dusit Palace to the edge of the Chao Phraya. It was later expanded to connect to Ratchaprarop Road, and then extended across the river to Charan Sanitwong Road when the Krung Thon Bridge began construction in 1954. Because it connected the two sections of the former Sang Hi Road on either side of the river, the Krung Thong Bridge has been called by locals Sang Hi Bridge (, Saphan Sang Hi) since before it was officially christened. The intersection of Ratchawithi and Samsen roads, the final intersection before crossing the bridge on the east side of the river, is named Sang Hi Intersection. The name was changed to Ratchawithi Road on February 16, 1918 by King Vajiravudh. The term is derived from the Pali/Sanskrit, ' + ', and means \\"royal way\\" or \\"king's road\\". The stretch of the road from Victory Monument to Kamphaeng Phet 5 Road is lined with a large number of hospitals and health-related institutions. These include Rajavithi Hospital and Boromarajonani College of Nursing, the Institute of Dermatology, Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health (Children's Hospital), Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Phramongkutklao Hospital and College of Medicine, the Royal Thai Army Nursing College, Prasat Neurological Institute and the under-construction extension of Ramathibodi Hospital. At Ratchawithi Intersection, where it meets Rama V Road near Chitralada Royal Villa and Dusit Zoo at about 6:30 am on Sunday October 14, 1973, there was a clash between a group of protesters demanding a constitution and police. It escalated into a bloody uprising recorded in history known as \\"Oct 14 event\\".

It is so called because a player has to follow a rotation of suits. It was first described in the book Games of PatienceM. Whitemore Jones, Games of Patience. and has since seen appeared in other books and solitaire software. Rules At the onset, one has to lay six cards in a row; this will compose the tableau. Like any solitaire game, the object is to remove the aces and build them up to kings. The catch of this game is the rotation of suits that the player must remember: A Club must be placed over a Heart, a Diamond over a Club, a Spade on a Diamond, and a Heart on a Spade. This rule applies to both the foundations and the tableau. Building on the tableau is down, provided that the rotation of suits described above is followed. An entire sequence in any length can be moved, again retaining the rotation of suits. When the cards in the tableau are not sufficient for building, the stock is dealt one card at a time onto a wastepile. The top card of the wastepile can be used to build on the tableau and the foundations. Once the stock is used up, the wastepile is picked up to become the new stock. This can be done only once in the game. Also, spaces in the tableau can be filled up with any card, whether it is from one of the cards already in the tableau, the top card of the wastepile, or the next card from the stock. The game ends soon after the stock runs out the second time. The game is won when all cards are built into the foundations, with the King of a foundation pile being the same suit as the Ace that started the pile.

His landscape design principles parallel those expressed in Alexander Pope's Epistle to Lord Burlington and the views on \\"natural\\" gardening expressed in essays by Joseph Addison.  Life and work  Switzer received sufficient early training in Hampshire to be taken on as a garden boy working for George London and Henry Wise in their Brompton nursery, in Kensington, now part of London. Switzer helped execute London's designs at Castle Howard, Yorkshire (from 1706), notably the \\"wilderness\\", at Cirencester Park, Gloucestershire (from about 1713), and at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire.Today's Blenheim landscape is largely the product of Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown, who remade the earlier landscape features. Switzer also designed the garden at Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire (about 1716). He is credited with the landscaping of Leeswood Hall, Flintshire for Sir George Wynne in the 1720s. In 1715 Stephen Switzer published a work on \\"Forest, or Rural Gardening\\", The Nobleman, Gentleman, and Gardener's Recreation,Its full title is The Nobleman, Gentleman, and Gardener's Recreation, or, an Introduction to Gardening, Planting, Agriculture, and the other Business and Pleasure of a Country life which he expanded to form his Ichnographia (1718; lightly revised and enlarged with two further essaysOne, A further Account of Rural or Extensive Gardening, appears from its text to have been written about 1730, according to David Jacques, \\"The Art and Sense of the Scribblerus Club in England, 1715-35\\", Garden History 4.1 (Spring 1976:30-53) p. p. 52 note 7. as Ichnographia Rustica 1741-42).
