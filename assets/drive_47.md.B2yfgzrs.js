Essentially, this chemical name describes doxorubicin attached to an acid sensitive linker (N-Œµ-maleimidocaproic acid hydrazide, or EMCH). The proposed mechanism of action is as follows: # After administration, aldoxorubicin rapidly binds endogenous circulating albumin through the EMCH linker. # Circulating albumin preferentially accumulates in tumors, bypassing uptake by other non-specific sites including heart, bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. # Once albumin-bound aldoxorubicin reaches the tumor, the acidic environment of the tumor causes cleavage of the acid sensitive linker. # Free doxorubicin is released at the site of the tumor.  Clinical trials  Five phase I trials for safety characterization have been completed. Several phase II and III trials are underway.  Phase II  As of January 2017, there are 6 phase II clinical trials in progress: # Second-line therapy for patients with glioblastoma # Treatment of HIV-positive patients with Kaposi's sarcoma # Combination therapy of ifosfamide and aldoxorubicin for treatment of metastatic or locally advanced sarcoma # Comparison of aldoxorubicin to the gold-standard treatment, topotecan, for metastatic small cell lung cancer # Treatment of advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma # Comparison of aldoxorubicin and doxorubicin for patients with metastatic or locally advanced carcinoma  Phase III  A phase III trial for patients with relapsed soft tissue sarcoma comparing aldoxorubicin with several other chemotherapeutics is expected to complete in 2018.

It is one of the largest media groups in Belgium. The group publishes nine regional newspapers in French, grouped since June 2010 under the brand name L'Avenir. History The Namur daily newspaper Vers l'Avenir has been published since 19 November 1918. It succeeded the Catholic daily L'Ami de l'Ordre, published from August 6, 1839 to November 18, 1918. Namur was occupied by the German Army in August 1914, early in the First World War, and though the German administration permitted L'Ami de l'Ordre to continue publishing, they closely controlled the contents of the paper. The paper's management wavered between collaboration with the occupation and resistance to German troops. When the Armistice of 11 November 1918 was announced and the German troops evacuated the city, the Bishop of Namur, Monsignor Heylen, removed Victor Delvaux as publisher and negotiated a management contract with and leased the premises to Ren√© Delforge. Delforge, together with the elites of Namur's Catholic Party (Max Wasseige, Fernand Golenvaux, Henri Bribosia, Adrien de Montpellier and Albert d‚ÄôHuart) founded a new Catholic newspaper Vers l'Avenir. Delvaux was forced to flee and though the Liege court of appeal acquitted him of collaboration offences in February 1922, a few months later Delvaux finally sold the premises and printing equipment to the bishop. Vers l'Avenir survived the Second World War rather better than L'Ami de l'Ordre had the First World War and was in a position to expand from Namur. It founded or acquired newspapers in the region including L'Avenir du Luxembourg in 1948, Le Courrier (in Verviers) in 1956 and L'Avenir - Le Courrier de l'Escaut (Tournai, in 1965). In May 1983, Vers l'Avenir launched its own radio on the 100.0 MHz frequency in the Namur region which broadcast until the early 1990s. In 1999, the diocese of Namur sold its 74% share in the capital of the paper to the Corelio printing and publishing group, which also publishes the Flemish dailies De Standaard and Het Nieuwsblad. Corelio acquired the remaining shares in 2005. The Corelio group closed the Rhisnes printing works and since then the l'Avenir newspapers have been printed at Groot-Bijgaarden. In 2013, Corelio divested l'Avenir to the Li√®ge-based Tecteo energy group for 26 million euros. Editions L'Avenir publishes nine editions covering different cities and provinces within French-speaking Belgium. The nine daily editions are as follows:lavenir.net - Daily Press L'Avenir.net, Accessed December 8, 2012 * L'Avenir Namur / Dinant * L'Avenir Basse Sambre * L'Avenir Entre-Sambre and Meuse * L'Avenir Brabant * L'Avenir Luxembourg * L'Avenir Verviers * L'Avenir de Huy-Waremme * L'Avenir - Le Courrier de l'Escaut (Tournai) * L'Avenir Mouscron L'Avenir also publishes a weekly for younger (9‚Äì13 years) readers:lavenir.net - Youth Press, L'Avenir.net, Accessed December 8, 2012 * JDE - Journal Des Enfants Internet All of the newspaper editions share a common website edition, lavenir.net that covers regional and national news as well as sports results throughout Belgium. It is also available in a mobile version for smartphones. Circulation The newspapers had in 2007 a combined circulation of 109,000 copies. This decreased to 94,000 units in 2014 for a paid sales of 84,000 copies, of which about 2.5% represents digital subscriptions (CIM figures). This decline of about 10% is significantly lower than the loss of 22% for the total of the francophone daily press in Belgium over the same period. Archives L'Avenir, at Villers-la-Ville The collections of old Namur newspapers and magazines of the Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique de Namur (Archaeological Society of Namur) covering the years from 1829 to 1981 were filed in 1999 in the Regional Archives Service of the Walloon Public Service at the Moulin de Meuse, Beez (Namur).

It was established by the Peruvian Ministry of Environment (MINAM; Spanish: Ministerio del Ambiente) on May 15, 2009. The reserve is managed and funded by the Regional Government of Loreto. Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area spans an area of 4,200.8 km2 (420,080.25 ha; 1'038,040.9 acre; 1,621.94 sq miles) comprising floodable and upland forest of the Peruvian Amazon. It is known for its abundant wildlife. It has high levels of biodiversity. Hundreds of species of mammals, primates, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, including several that are endemic as well as either endangered or threatened. The reserve was established to conserve ecosystems of upland and floodable rainforests, as well as ecological and evolutionary processes of the area, guaranteeing the sustainable use of the wildlife by the local population. Tamshiyacu Tahuayo has several research and tourist activities focused on wildlife-spotting, including camping, hiking, boating, bird watching and fishing.  History  Much research had been conducted in this area since the mid-1970s. Between 1980 and 1990 the importance of conserving the area was highlighted due its unique and vast biodiversity, especially the high diversity of primates as the threatened red bald uakari (Cacajao calvus ucayalii), endemic to Peru, as well as other species recently recorded as the Ranitomeya uakarii. During the 1980s, the Peruvian government noted the unusual number of primates produced by this region and so in the early 1980s biologist Pekka Soini (who later became renowned for his conservation work with Amazon turtles in the Pacaya Samiria) and his assistant Rogelio Castro, conducted the first primate population survey under the auspices of IVITA (the Peruvian Instituto Veterinario de Investigaciones Tropicales y de Altura). In 1984 University of Illinois primatologist Paul Garber and his student Richard Bodmer came from the United States to further study the mammalian ecology. Evidence of the regions ecological importance continued to grow. Additionally, local villages of the Tahuayo River and the Blanco River had long grown tired of the exploitation and degradation of natural resources in the area which had started in the 1970s. In the late 1980s conservationist Greg Neise and Richard Bodmer worked with the communities of the Tahuayo River to develop a plan to have the region recognized as a community reserve. A few years later the passage of Propuesta Tecnia by the province of Maynas become a reality. On June 19, 1991 with the enactment of Executive Resolution #080-91-CR-GRA-P. The reserve was declared a community reserve and named Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu- Tahuayo (RCTT) after two of its major boundary rivers. Initial conservation efforts in the RCTT were funded by the Rainforest Conservation Fund (RCF), based in Chicago and headed by Neise. Unfortunately, during the first ten years of its creation the legal protection of the RCTT failed as commercial loggers and fisheries exploited many resources. The situation was made worse due to the anti-conservationist sentiments heading the regional government of Loreto. The governor at the time, Robinson, was opposed to expanding or even honoring any existing conservation measures. The reserve was on the brink of collapse. However, in 2006 the election of pro-conservation candidate Yvan Vasquez as regional president of Loreto renewed support for Tahuayo conservation. Soon after Vasquez election the reserve was expanded in size to over a million acres (over 440,000 hectares) and given added legal protection. On May 21, 2007, the Regional Government of Loreto signed the Ordenanza Regional 011-2007-GRL-CR that approved the technical proposal for the establishment of the protected area. The proposal was signed at a ceremony held at Amazonia Expeditions Amazon Research Center. A few years later on May 15, 2009 the proposal was ratified by the national government of Peru in Lima, the Ministry of Environment signed the Decreto Supremo 010-2009-MINAM, law that officially created the Area de Conservation Regional Communal Tamshiyacu Tahuayo (ACRCTT).  Geography  ACRCTT is located within the Department of Loreto, in the north of Peru. It is 420,080.25 ha (4,200.8 km2; 1‚Äô038,040.9 acres) in area. The reserve comprises rivers, lakes, canals, oxbow lakes, swamps, several types of upland and lowland forests including varzea, igapo, and terra firme.  Biology and ecology  The conservation area includes part of the Iquitos v√°rzea ecoregion. ACRCTT has many world records on diversity of plants, primates and mammals species.  Flora  ACRCTT has habitat that supports a known 1650 species of plants, however it is estimated that there are 2500-3500 species of plants in ACRCTT. It is possible to find trees such cedar (Cedrela odorata), mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), and others.  Fauna  In 2003 the Chicago Field Museum‚Äôs Rapid Biological Inventory, found in the ACRCTT 240 species of fish, 77 species of amphibians, 45 species of reptiles, 400 species of birds, and 39 species of terrestrial mammals, including 14 species of primates. Subsequent research has increased the totals to over 110 species of terrestrial mammals (Michael Valqui, doctoral thesis, University of Florida), over 600 species of birds (Dr. Carol Foss, Noam Shaney, Alfredo Begazo, Josias Tello, Andy Bicerra) and at least 16 species of primates, including a new species of saki monkey being described by Dr. Janice Chism (Winthrop University). Some of the wildlife that inhabits the ACRCTT area are monkeys the huapo Colorado or red bald uakari (Cacajao calvus ucayalii), the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), the red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus); the pink dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), the grey dolphin (Sotalia fluviatilis), the brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus), the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), the black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), the South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), the giant river otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), jaguar (Panthera onca), the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the wattled curassow (Crax globulosa), the hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin), the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), among others.  Climate  ACRCTT is located on the Amazon rainforest, near the Amazon River. This protected area is located on the lowland jungle (Spanish: selva baja) also known as Omagua region or Amazon basin. It has annual temperatures ranging from 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F) to 33 ¬∞C (91 ¬∞F) and an annual rainfall of  Tourism and activities  It is possible to visit the ACRCTT year-round, however, the busiest season for visitors is from June to August, this is also the high tourist season throughout Peru. As of 2018, there are several tourism facilities operating in areas near the ACRCTT with the ability to offer excursions into the reserve. Most tourism facilities are a 3-4 hour speed boat ride from Iquitos. Many of these lodges offer private bungalows with private bathrooms and most lodges have electricity, some, via solar power. Tahuayo Lodge, Grand Amazon Lodge, Muyuna Lodge, Curassow Lodge, Aqua Expeditions Lodge are all built within the border areas of the reserve as no new construction is permitted within the reserves formal boundaries. The only tourism facility located entirely within the reserve is Amazonia Expeditions secondary lodge, the Amazon Research Center Lodge, this is the only man made structure that exists within the over 1 million acre conservation area as it was grandfathered in after the creation of the reserve. Visitors partake in boating on rivers, lagoons and oxbow, hiking and camping, these activities are focused on wildlife observation. Also travelers may fish and navigate the Amazon River. ACRCTT has great biodiversity and spans over an important flyway of migratory birds hence it is popular for bird watching and bird photography also.

Based on personal experiences lived by Brazilian TV host Xuxa Meneghel. It contains in his cast Xuxa Meneghel, Guilherme Karan, Debby Lagranha, Leonardo Cordonis, Gugu Liberato, Ana Maria Braga, Emiliano Queiroz, Ang√©lica, Wanessa Camargo. The kingdom of the elves is celebrating the delivery of the responsibility of taking care of the nature to the prince Damiz. But villain Gorgon holds the little elf on the wall of Little Girl Nanda's room and convinces his partner, Rico, to buy the girl's house and take \\"progress\\" to the forest. Kira will have the mission to free the stuck imprisoned in the wall and save Earth. The film was produced by Diler Trindade with co-production by Globo Filmes and Warner Bros., and was released in theaters on December 14, 2001. The film was watched by approximately 2,657,091 box office according to Ancine, and earned more than 11 million Brazilian reals for its producers. As was already common in other Xuxa films, Duendes was received with suspicion by specialized critics. However, all were unanimous in saying that they represented a breakthrough in comparison with the previous ones. Praising the end of over-merchandising, but criticizing the film's script for being \\"unstable, with weak performances,\\" an extremely childish script and incoherent dialogues. Writing \\"Duendes\\" is a change, has cliches in tons, but for Xuxa, who did everything a little on the screens, this is no problem and that the film was produced just to please its audience, in this case a multitude of children. The success of the film led Xuxa to create a sequel titled Xuxa e os Duendes 2: No Caminho das Fadas, released the following year.  Plot  Kira (Xuxa) is a botanist who has strange gifts, such as talking to plants and making others sneeze. She can not remember her past, and she lives in a greenhouse with her fumbling Tomate (Luciano Huck) and Alface (Tadeu Mello). Kira, unknowingly, is the Duende of Light, daughter of Mika (Emiliano Queiroz) and Zinga (Ana Maria Braga), the kings of the elves. His brother, Damiz (Leonardo Cordonis), the Friendship Goblin, was kidnapped by a Gorgon (Guilherme Karan), the greatest enemy of the race, being trapped on the wall of Nanda's (Debby Lagranha) bedroom, a 10-year-old girl, Kira's friend. His parents are experiencing financial difficulties and then decide to sell the house and move. Only Nanda is suffering because she does not want to leave and leave her new friend Damiz alone. Rico (Gugu Liberato) is a businessman manipulated by Gorgon, the Goblin of Envy, who has been expelled from the world of elementals as a traitor, and now lives in the form of a human being. Rico only thinks about destroying nature and money, due to the negative energy of Gorgon, who forces him to buy the house of Jessica and Otavio, parents of Nanda, and demolish it. Gorgon knows that Damiz is trapped there and that near the house lies the magical gateway to the kingdom of the fairies. Demolishing the house, Gorgon will destroy Damiz and all elemental beings. Meanwhile, Queen Zinga and King Mika use all their resources to rescue their son. The sovereigns seek help from Morgan, the fairy queen, who sends the fairies Mel (Wanessa Camargo) and Melissa (Ang√©lica), to look for Damiz. These soon know Kira and discover the villains of Gorgon, but they can not intercede, because the terrible evil power of him is stronger and they end up captured. So does Rodin (David Brazil), the swift goblin. Now, the mission to free Damiz will be on Kira's, who will discover great unbelievable secrets.

At the same time, he fulfilled a clause in his contract with Diler & Associados in which he should make two films aimed at the adolescent public and one for the children's public. And so, began to be sketched the new film project of the presenter. Xuxa wanted to do something different from her two previous films in the cinema: Xuxa Requebra (1999) and Xuxa Popstar (2000). If in these feature films the idea was to bring Planeta Xuxa to the cinema, privileging the musical attractions to the detriment of history, in that it was sought not only to create a more consistent plot, but to create an entire universe, which had its own rules. In this way, Xuxa tried to follow the trend of the film market at the time: to bet on a fantastic story, mixing the real world with the magical world. However, rather than betting on the fantasy genre, Xuxa wanted something that represented her willingness to retell stories to children. The idea of creating a film based on Duende came after a controversial statement by the host. In all interviews, the singer was emphatic in claiming that she had seen goblins on two occasions. Xuxa said the Goblins used to show up in their room at night. She told friends that the apparitions only ceased when one of the elves (female, according to Xuxa) cried beside her bed and she received the hint that she should feed them. The hostess then put food on the counter in the room where she puts the elves she wins. \\"I put fruits, raisins,\\" he said. \\"They're gone.\\" The presenter's account controversies in the media. It was then that its manager Marlene Mattos, decided to take something beneficial from the situation make a movie, about Duendes. Since the film did not fit the musical attractions, the idea was to bring personalities (the vast majority of them non-actors) to the main roles. The meeting of the three Brazilian presenters - Xuxa, Angelica and Eliana: constantly called rivals, the presenters had shown on previous occasions that there was no hostility between them, like the launch of the Hopi Hari park in 1999. The idea was also show that peace in theaters. Ang√©lica was invited by Xuxa and quickly confirmed her presence in the film. With Eliana the story was a bit different. Although declaring that she was flattered by the invitation, it was not authorized by the television network in which she worked at the time, Rede Record. The broadcaster's justification is that it was also linked to \\"Record Movies\\" and there was the project of a film for the presenter only. and their participation, could overshadow the project. The character that Eliana would do, Fada Mel, was then performed by singer Wanessa Camargo. With each new Xuxa film, the expectation was to know who the new show's heartthrob would be. After the singer Daniel, chosen through research with the public in Xuxa Requebra (1999) and Luigi Barichelli in Xuxa Popstar (2000), the idea was to maintain the standard of having a desired man of the time. The first named name was Rodrigo Santoro, Another speculated name was Reynaldo Gianecchini, Arriving near the beginning of the filming and in the face of the difficulty of finding the romantic pair, it was chosen to exclude the part of romance of the film. Gugu spoke in his Tititi magazine column, which had received the invitation a few days before and in less than 24 hours was reading the script, quickly accepting the proposal. The character Gorgon, initially thought of the name of singer Fabio Jr to be the villain of the tape. The role was eventually interpreted by Guilherme Karan, reissuing the battle of good against the evil of Super Xuxa Contra Baixo Astral (1988). The other cast names, such as Leonardo Cordonis (Damiz), Queen Zinga (Ana Maria Braga) Fada Morgana (Luciana Gimenez). Alface (Tadeu Mello) and Nanda (Debby Lagranha), were apparently the first listed and accepted promptly. Post-production Effects In addition to the controversy over the elves made by the media and the casting of personalities for the cast, another highlight of Xuxa e os Duendes, was their pioneering technology. The Xuxa feature film was one of the first films in the world to use 24P Digital HD cameras, which had filming, editing and digital finishing, i.e. without using film. The rent of these two cameras cost R$275 thousand. At the time, George Lucas was using the same for the filming of Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, which was to be released in 2002. Diler Trindade, in testimony to the extras of the DVD of the film, informs that Duendes was the third film in the world to be launched with the digital technology. Marcelo Siqueira, of Teleimage, responsible for the special effects, specifies that the feature film was the first in Latin America. Due to the lack of knowledge of Brazilian technicians with the new technology, the production of the film brought the American Rafael Aladame, engineering director of Panavision, to make sure that the cameras were being used in the correct way. Currently, most films are made without film and using digital technology. Music Xuxa e os Duendes the soundtrack of the film of the same name, released in 2002 by Som Livre. The album consists of songs performed by the protagonist, the presenter Xuxa Meneghel and other artists. The soundtrack was released in early 2002, shortly after the release of the film on DVD. The soundtrack brings several artists such as Angelica, Carlinhos Brown, and Wanessa Camargo. The soundtrack was released in CD and cassette formats. Release The film was first presented to the press on December 1, in addition to Xuxa, part of the cast was also on the spot. Presenters Luciano Huck, Gugu Liberato and Angelica, singer Wanessa Camargo and actors Guilherme Karan and David Brazil attended the production for the first time together with the guests and the press. Before beginning the session, actors, children and adults, dressed as goblins, made a brief staging on the theme of the film. During the show, the \\"elves\\" were scattered around the movie theater, giving a mood of magic to the preview. The premiere became a benefit, on December 13, 2001, in several cinemas in Brazil. With this attitude, Xuxa goes back to the tradition of helping the neediest in the launch of his films, as in A Princesa Xuxa e os Trapalh√µes (1989) - clothes and in Lua de Cristal (1990) - non-perishable food. With Duendes, the directors (Xuxa Producciones, Diler & Associados, Warner and Globo Filmes) and exhibitors (such as the UCI and Cinemark) gave up their profits, making 100% of the box office go to 20 charities, among they are: Association of Support to the Child against Cancer (S√£o Paulo), Rio Cardiol√≥gica Infantil (Rio de Janeiro), Association Movimento Avante Len√ß√≥is (Bahia), Project Previd√™ncia (Minas Gerais), Assistance Association for the Deprived Child (Rio Grande do Sul), Child Support Group with Cancer (Sergipe) and Casa Sonhos de Crian√ßa (Maranh√£o). This action ended up bringing more than 30,000 people to theaters on December 13, 2001, raising R$120,000, an amount that was shared equally among all institutions. Xuxa e os Duendes entered December 14, 2001, in more than 200 rooms, across the country. It was planned to launch the film in Mexico, which for reasons unknown, did not occur. Reception Critical reception As was already common in other Xuxa films, Duendes was received with suspicion by specialized critics. However, everyone was unanimous in saying that it represented a breakthrough in comparison with the previous ones. Marcelo Forlani of the Omelette site praised the end of excess merchandising, but criticized the film's script for being \\"fickle, with performances weaker than the Playboy jokes,\\" an extremely screenplay infantilized and incoherent dialogues.\\" Mario S√©rgio Conti da Folha was even more severe in his analysis of the film, writing that the writers of the film Paulo Sergio Almeida and Rog√©rio Gomes, are not authors, \\"are technical, The authors' film is a vehicle for a celebrities fake, for him \\"Xuxa and the Elves\\" is the expression of a worn, sad, solitary, childish, unidentified, schizophrenic, antifamily, insensitive, magical and materialistic woman\\". He also criticized Xuxa for \\"Little caring about the fate of the worker, who ends the film jobless and without having support.\\" and to finish he again criticized the profile of the main character by preaching the belief in \\"in nature and magic\\" but abandoned his real nature, the elf, to stay on earth. In this she mimics Xuxa, who abandoned human nature to become a commodity. Already the appeal to the belief in the magic has reason to be: the merchandise Xuxa operates the magic of transforming the dizzy tale of the diseased elf in a millionaire treasure.\\" Jo√£o Fl√°vio Martinez from the Di√°rio da Regi√£o website, wrote \\"that \\"Duendes\\" for a change, has clich√©s in tons, from the first to the last frame. But for Xuxa, who has done everything a little on the screens, this is no problem and that the film was produced just to please its audience, in this case, a multitude of children. For them, it's all right, as long as Xuxa and her non-actor basket court appear\\". Juliana Lima of the Cine Trash website also criticized \\"Xuxa e os Duendes\\", \\"In addition to the predictable storyline, the film features such a character characterization that it is comical. , but it might be na√Øve to think that Luciano Huck, Gugu Liberato and Ana Maria Braga - both TV presenters - would do a good job as actors.While considering the non-Hollywood timeline and budget of the film, we can not ignore the bad special effects. Highlight the scene in which Kira speaks looking directly at the camera, at the audience, and asks them to clap their hands if they believe in magic, in a frustrated attempt to imitate Peter Pan.\\" Box office Changing the film line was a bold decision, as this model was working very well. Returning quickly to the previous films: Xuxa Requebra (1999) was the record holder of Brazilian cinema (a period that began in 1995, with the film Carlota Joaquina, Princess of Brazil), with 2,074,461 spectators according to the website of Ancine - Ag√™ncia Nacional do Cinema). Already Xuxa Popstar (2000) managed to go beyond. With a box office of 2,394,326, he was not only the record holder of Brazilian cinema, but by November 2001 he was the movie recorder considering all the 2001 films. That means he made more box office than films like Shrek, Castaway, The Mummy Returns and Jurassic Park 3 in Brazil. With Xuxa and the Elves, Xuxa's success solidified and she had definitely become the Queen of Brazilian Cinema. If there was any distrust on the part of the investors of the film that he would not work, since it had left the formula of success of the previous ones, she was soon dissipated by the overwhelming success of Duendes. Released in 300 rooms, on December 14, 2001, the film was viewed by 2,657,091 spectators, automatically becoming the record holder of the \\"return\\" of National Cinema. The record was only surpassed one year later by City of God, which reached 2,762,625. Xuxa received the commemorative plaque for having surpassed 2.5 million in the Planet Xuxa of the hands of Diler Trinity. Three weeks after it was released, the film had already been seen by more than 700,000 people. \\"Xuxa e os Duendes\\" was the most expensive film of the Xuxa (budget of 3.8 million). Diler Trindade's goal was to reach 2.5 million viewers and earn R $10 million. Diler's prediction was almost right: the movie grossed R $11,681,917.00. Home media The movie was released on DVD and VHS by Warner on June 28, 2002, The DVD contains extras and is the first in Brazil with high definition that allows you to choose the screen format. The VHS also has extras, which is little used in Brazil. The press conference held at Unibanco Arteplex, at Shopping Frei Caneca, was attended by Danilo Moura, of TeleImage (company belonging to the Casablanca group), Brent Hieat, director of the adaptation of the film and its extras to the DVD, and Diler Trindade, producer of the film. According to Moura the intention was to make a DVD completely different from the market, putting everything that a disk has capacity. The images were taken in high definition, which allowed them to reach the disc with quality seven times higher than normal DVDs. The user can enjoy three screen formats: full screen (Pan and scan), with Letterboxing, and Widescreen. The options are available not only to the movie but also to all the extras. The director of the DVD, Brent Hieat, said some scenes have already been recorded for multi-angle viewing. \\"By the way, the whole movie can be seen like that,\\" Hieat said. Hieat began the project of the DVD during the filming Xuxa and the Goblins. He claimed to have used all his own technology and entertainment for the records; \\"is what makes the DVD revenge\\". There are also three games on the DVD. One can be used on the device itself. The others on the computer with DVD drive. Another novelty is the Easter Eggs (Read More), hidden bonuses for the user to look for the extra. This is a feature commonly used in the United States. Rubens Ewald Filho praised the quality of the DVD of the film, writing that \\"it is superior to the previous ones (films of the presenter). TV presenters as actors, in roles of even responsibility (none of them compromises, none however reveals itself) but criticized the fact that presenter Huck has partnered with Tadeu Mello \\"we were in a little mood. But if the digital effects are nice, the musical numbers are too fast.\\" The script has no problem copying Peter Pan (the famous scene with Tinker Bell) and others (the grandmother telling the story to the grandson). Even Xuxa seems better treated and more at ease than in the previous films. Sequel Xuxa e os Duendes has a sequel: Xuxa e os Duendes 2: No Caminho das Fadas (2002). That also received the same low acclaim from critics, However, he was also a big hit of box office.

He is known for using mathematical formulas to create drawings of real-life objects, intricate illustrations, animations, fractals and tessellations. Naderi Yeganeh uses mathematics as the main tool to create artworks. Therefore, his artworks can be totally described by mathematical concepts. Mahematical concepts he uses in his work include trigonometric functions, exponential function, Fibonacci sequence, sawtooth wave, etc. His artwork 9,000 Ellipses was used as the background cover image of The American Mathematical Monthly ‚Äì November 2017. His artwork Heart was used as the image for the February page of the 2019 Calendar of Mathematical Imagery published by the American Mathematical Society. His artwork Bird was used as the postcard image of the Art ‚à© Math exhibit held at Center on Contemporary Art, Seattle in 2018. One of the Naderi Yeganeh's artworks was used as the cover image for Newsletter of Iranian Mathematical Society, Autumn 2015. His works including A Bird in Flight and Boat have been used on several pages of the International Mathematical Knowledge Trust (IMKT)'s website. Works Drawings of real-life objects A Bird in Flight, by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh is an example of drawing real-life objects with math. Naderi Yeganeh has introduced two methods to draw real-life objects with mathematical formulas. In the first method, he creates tens of thousands of computer- generated mathematical figures to find a few interesting shapes accidentally. For example, by using this method, he found some shapes that resemble birds, fishes and sailing boats. In the second method, he draws a real life object with a step-by-step process. In each step, he tries to find out which mathematical formulas will produce the drawing. For example, by using this method, he drew birds in flight, butterflies, human faces and plants using trigonometric functions. Naderi Yeganeh says: \\"In order to create such shapes, it is very useful to know the properties of the trigonometric functions\\". Fractals and tessellations He has designed some fractals and tessellations inspired by the continents. For example, in 2015, he described the fractal Africa with an Africa-like octagon and its lateral inversion. And he has created tessellations with Northern America-like and South America-like polygons. Comments on his work In 2015, CNN used the queastion \\"Is this the next da Vinci?\\" for the title of a video about Naderi Yeganeh's work and RT en Espa√±ol used the question \\"New da Vinci?\\" at the beginning of the title of an article about him and Al Arabiya used this question for the article about Naderi Yeganeh: \\"Is this Iranian student da Vinci's successor?\\". And Iranian media such as IRNA and Isfahan Ziba titled him as \\"The Iranian da Vinci\\" and \\"Iran's da Vinci\\" in their articles about Hamid Naderi Yeganeh. In 2015, The National Museum of Mathematics stated in a post on Facebook that \\"Hamid Naderi Yeganeh takes graphing art to the next level!\\" In 2016, Institute for Mathematics and its Applications commented on the Naderi Yeganeh's blog post showing how to draw human faces with mathematical equations: \\"Another reason that math wins\\". In 2016, COSMOS raised this question in the introduction to its interview with Hamid Naderi Yeganeh: \\"Why couldn't high school mathematics be more like this?\\" in order to get its readers thinking about the potential of using Naderi Yeganeh's work in mathematics education. In 2016, Mathematics in Education and Industry stated in a tweet that: \\"Hamid Naderi Yeganeh is a mathematical artist who's created plant images by trigonometric functions.\\" In 2016, Barbour Design Inc. stated on its own blog that \\"These often delicately intricate works are quite remarkable, and more astounding is that Yeganeh writes computer programs based on mathematical equations to produce them.\\" In 2017, Mathematical Association of America commented about one of Naderi Yeganeh's animations in a tweet: \\"Watch the beauty of trigonometric functions come alive\\". In 2017, Fields Institute described Naderi Yeganeh's work as \\"beautiful math\\" in a tweet. In 2017, Berkeley Lab commented on one of Naderi Yeganeh's blog posts: \\"Create stunning symmetrical images armed with a few equations and a computer\\". In 2015, Asia Society Philippines stated in a post on Facebook that \\"Hamid Naderi Yeganeh reveals the beauty of Math through Art\\".  Views  Naderi Yeganeh believes that there are an infinite number of ways of using mathematical tools in art. In 2015, in an interview with CNN Style he said: \\"The power of mathematics is unlimited. There's an infinite number of great artworks that we can create\\". He says, \\"I don‚Äôt think computer-made art clashes with human creativity, but it can change the role of artists.‚Äù In 2016, He said in an interview with Dong-A Science: \\"For me, mathematics is the best tool to create works of art.\\" Hamid Naderi Yeganeh believes that introducing mathematical objects that resemble real recognizable things may encourage young people to pursue mathematics. He believes mathematics is an international culture and mathematics can help to promote peace and love between nations. Naderi Yeganeh believes that Pi is an international number and it can be a symbol of peace between nations. Education Naderi Yeganeh received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Qom and a M.Sc. in Pure Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. He won a gold medal at the 38th Iranian Mathematical Society‚Äôs nationwide mathematics competition held at Graduate University of Advanced Technology in May 2014 and a silver medal at the 39th IMS‚Äôs nationwide mathematics competition held at Yazd University in May 2015.

Noteworthy contributors to the book include: Kofi A. Annan, Rony Brauman, Romeo A. Dallaire, Richard J. Goldstone, J. Bryan Hehir, Michael Ignatieff, Ian Martin, Elizabeth Reid, Mohamed Sahnoun, Mu Sochua, Cornelio Sommaruga, Roger Williamson, and Jos√© Zalaquett. It was published in paperback format by Rowman & Littlefield in 1998. The book received a positive reception from reviews in academic journals including: Foreign Affairs published by the Council on Foreign Relations, Ethics & International Affairs, and International Review of the Red Cross. Contents summary Jonathan Moore drew together noteworthy writers to contribute to Hard Choices, including: Kofi A. Annan, Rony Brauman, Romeo A. Dallaire, Richard J. Goldstone, J. Bryan Hehir, Michael Ignatieff, Ian Martin, Elizabeth Reid, Mohamed Sahnoun, Mu Sochua, Cornelio Sommaruga, Roger Williamson, and Jos√© Zalaquett. These individuals have backgrounds in humanitarian aid, academia, and global policymaking. The book attempts to analyze international response to humanitarian interventions, and suggest ways to improve these processes. Hard Choices argues that people on the global stage have modified their thoughts regarding humanitarian interventions after striving to assist in aid to Somalia. World leaders observed that initiatives crafted to help with basic problems and promote stability in the region ended up having unfortunate negative consequences. Groups wishing to assist in such matters including nongovernmental organizations, the United Nations, and sovereign armies found they were unclear as to the best method to apply to situations where countries require humanitarian aid. These problems, including those derived from economic inequity, are further muddied due to interests of multiple different stakeholders. The authors assert that further resources should be devoted to addressing moral challenges worldwide. In addition to Somalia, the book addresses humanitarian problems caused by conflicts in Bosnia, Cambodia, Haiti, and Rwanda. Major issues grappled with by the authors include problems caused by international sales in the defense industry, global refugees, international sanctions, economic impact of HIV/AIDS, and human rights. The contributors argue that these complex problems may be mitigated through discussion and analysis motivated by a desire to raise the level of quality involved in choices taken by world leaders during policymaking regarding humanitarian intervention. Publication history Hard Choices was sponsored by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Jonathan Moore had been asked by the ICRC in 1996 to produce a monograph which would examine issues surrounding humanitarian intervention. The book was first published in paperback format by Rowman & Littlefield in 1998. It was published in an eBook format in the same year. Rowman & Littlefield released a hardcover edition in 1999. Reception Hard Choices was reviewed in the journal Foreign Affairs published by the Council on Foreign Relations. In the review, Eliot A. Cohen observed that the book confronted \\"uncomfortable truths\\". Cohen concluded, \\"Whether medieval politics can control, much less eliminate, medieval brutality is the unanswered question that hangs over this book.\\" The New York Times discussed the work and cited contributors Rony Brauman and Mary B. Anderson in an article about problematic issues surrounding disaster relief. Ethics & International Affairs published a review of the book by Nicholas Xenos, who wrote: \\"The practitioners who reflect on their experience here strike a consistent theme: Many difficult decisions had to be made, along with trade-offs between consistent concern for human rights and the desire to provide safety, needs assistance, or developmental aid.\\" In a review in International Review of the Red Cross, Fr√©d√©ric M√©gret commented: \\"Hard Choices argues convincingly in favour of a moral pragmatism that rejects any form of extremism.\\" M√©gret's review concluded: \\"Awareness of the existence of ethical challenges is already a step towards taking them into account. In this regard Hard Choices is a remarkably frank attempt to consider the consequences and the shortcomings of humanitarian intervention.\\" M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res USA include the book among their recommended reading for potential field and office staff.

It addressed the living conditions of the poorest sector as well as the working class who lived in the public housing estates and squatter huts below the Lion Rock in the 1970s. They worked hard to collectively rebuild Hong Kong after World War II. The series highlighted the commonly shared core values of Hong Kong people, namely the \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\". RTHK described the \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" as \\"perseverance and solidarity\\" (). Background of traditional Lion Rock Spirit In the 1970s, \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" was embodied by the poorest sector in Hong Kong who rode through ups and downs together. It was a daily challenge for the citizens to make a living. They could only afford simple foods and their stomachs are not always as full as they wished to be. Besides, not all children could further study after the free education. In 1976, the Director of Education stated that 68,000 children between age of 10 to 14 had discontinued their education as their parents could not support the tuition fees, and some had to start working to support their families. However, they stayed optimistic and persevered in facing their challenges. Despite the poor living standard of Hong Kong people, the 1970s is said to be characterised by rapid economic development and expansion. This is attributed to the surge in labour force. After the period of baby boomers, an influx of mainland Chinese emigrated to Hong Kong in a bid to escape from the social instability caused by war and persecution in mainland China. The mainland emigrants worked hard to strive for betterment in their living standard. Most importantly, all of the Hong Kong citizens upheld the \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" and worked hard together to build a secure and prosperous future. Cultural influence of Below the Lion Rock  The theme song of Below the Lion Rock is a witness of the livelihood in the 1970s. Despite popularity of the song, the symbolic meanings of its lyrics have not generated great cultural significance until Mr. Anthony Leung, the former financial secretary, cited the last stanza of the lyrics in his budget address (È¶ôÊ∏ØÊîøÂ∫úË≤°ÊîøÈ†êÁÆóÊ°à) in 2002. He borrowed the lyrics to boost the morale of Hong Kong citizens, by reminding them to uphold the \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" when facing severe budgetary deficit and economic gloom. He encouraged citizens from all walks of life to put aside their differences, so as to co-operate in overcoming the economic adversaries. Since then, \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" has become a symbol of cultural identity of Hong Kong people. Its lyrics have concurrently been referred to in numerous festive and official events, for example, Mr. Zhu Rongji, Premier of People's Republic of China included part of the lyrics in his speech. This reflected the central government would support Hong Kong to emerge from its economic woes. Thus, the \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" is commonly used by businessmen and political leaders to associate the citizens and boost their morale when facing social challenges. Core values reflected in the lyrics The last stanza of the lyrics of Below the Lion Rock that symbolises the core values of \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\": 1\\\\. Of one mind in pursuit of our dream, All discord set aside, with one heart on the same bright quest, Hand in hand to the ends of the Earth. Solidarity is upheld by Hong Kongers. They would disregard of social classes and ethnic differences, so as to collectively overcome the adversaries \\"on the same boat\\" (). For instance, the whole family worked together to produce plastic flowers or to put stickers on toys to sustain the family's living. 2\\\\. Fearless and valiant inside, Rough terrain no respite. Side by side we overcome ills, As the Hong Kong story we write. Perseverance of Hong Kong people is reflected. Hong Kong people weigh upon the motto of \\"never give up\\" () in the face of challenges. They believed they could \\"create miracles from the impossible\\" () as long as they worked hard and supported each other to fulfill their life goals. By upholding solidarity and perseverance of \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\", HongKongers are empowered with the collective strength to conquer traumatic events like the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, and SARS epidemic in 2003. Existence of Lion Rock Spirit in modern Hong Kong With rapid socio-economic advancement, families have become more prosperous. Living standard has risen to an extent that it is different from the adverse living conditions in the 1970s. Children nowadays can receive free education. Moreover, foods are more abundant to an extent that the government is obliged to encourage citizens to reduce food wastage. Due to enhancement in the living standard of Hong Kong people, their problems have changed from maintaining a secured living environment to pursuing political advancement. Simultaneously, the meaning of \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" among the new generation has changed according to the current social context. It includes not merely the support for each other in a physical manner, but in a spiritual or political way. The rise of Modernized Lion Rock Spirit Admiralty during occupy movement in Hong Kong to collectively fight for real democracy and universal suffrage. The \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" has in recent years been modernised to express the socio-political aspirations of Hong Kong protestors for real democracy, social equality and justice. The young people have become more mobilised to voice out their opinions and demands through active political participation. More young people assembled together to join protests and public consultations on issues like moral and national education, the amendments in housing policies and democratic reform for genuine universal suffrage in the legislative and executive positions. The \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" has been redefined by the new generation through integrating the traditionally shared values of solidarity and perseverance to strive for upward social mobility and economic advancement, with the recent socio-political context in fighting for a just and fair society. Thus, the \\"Lion Rock Spirit\\" is subject to redefinition as the social context changes.

In doing so, it contrasts the speakers' perception that their own practice of Wicca is authentic, as opposed to that of the inauthentic \\"fluffy bunny\\". The usage of the term has been examined by a number of academics operating in the field of Pagan studies. Definitions Angela Coco and Ian Woodward studied a 2002 discussion thread in which Wiccan participants debated what it meant to be a \\"fluffy bunny\\". They concluded that the participants associated a number of traits with those they labelled as \\"fluffy bunnies\\": \\"pragmatic, profiteering, dabbling, modern, superficial, peripheral to community, playful, and using multimedia to further practical and capitalist values.\\" For many of those contributing to the thread, the term \\"fluffy bunny\\" was \\"linked to the person who is uninformed, immature, and lacking in their understanding of the forces of nature and consequently dangerous because they may misuse magic.\\" They added that on this thread, a minority of participants defended the legitimacy of \\"fluffy bunnies\\" to practice Wicca as they saw fit, highlighting that not all practitioners have the same level of experience and involvement in the religion. They also noted that various practitioners expressed the opinion or hope that no-one would think that they themselves were \\"fluffy bunnies\\". Ultimately, they thought that the term \\"fluffy bunny\\" was a trope used \\"to invoke a generally felt collective consciousness of an \\"authentic pagan\\" identity\\". Since the religion's rise in popularity, several pejorative terms such as \\"fluffy bunny\\" or the \\"old lady brigade\\" have been used in the Wiccan and Neo-Pagan community to describe adherents that they view as superficial or faddish. Common descriptions given by people using the term include elements such as the practitioner deliberately choosing to emphasize goodness, light, eclecticism and elements taken from the New Age movement over elements seen as too dark, as well as the practitioner appearing to follow the religion as a fad. The term \\"fluffy bunny\\" became more prevalent in the 1990s after it was used to describe a depiction of the Wiccan religion in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The show, which featured a Wiccan coven, raised ire from practitioners of Wicca who believe that the coven in the show reinforced stereotypes. Modern colloquial usage of the term in online communities such as Tumblr and eCauldron has changed to indicate people who are willfully ignorant or purveyors of false information (notably, incorrect statistics and facts regarding \\"The Burning Times\\"), rather than those who prefer \\"love and light\\" New Age philosophies or who emulate pop culture.

Ayesha has her own intentions and as she gets the opportunity, she steals Aarti and Raghu's daughter and escapes with the child, leaving her career, stardom and dreamgirl title (which were by then ruined due to her evilness) for one single motive-to make the baby girl her own daughter and, to train the child, as the next DREAMGIRL.

It is also the first established high school of what is now Bangladesh. Founded in 1836, it is situated in the Kalighat area of Sylhet, on the bank of the Surma River. History In the 1830s, when the East India Company controlled what is now Bangladesh, the Governor General of India, Lord William Bentinck, tried to promote fluency in English. This was a primary factor for the establishment in 1836 of the Sylhet Government Pilot High School.Siddiquee, Iqbal. \\"Sylhet Government Pilot High School: 171 Years\\", Star Insight (23 June 2007) Official records show that there were 74 students in 1841.

In 1897 the Prize Memorial Library was established following a fundraising campaign. After many years, the library merged with the Kendrio Muslim Sahitya Sangsad Library. In 1869 it was renamed Sylhet Government High School and Rai Sahib Durgakumar Basu was appointed Headmaster. The 12th June earthquake of 1897 completely destroyed the school building. Classes were later resumed at a different location, which became the current location of Sylhet Pilot Girls High School. In 1903, Rai Sahib Durga Kumar Basu retired from his government job and Baikunthanath Bhattacharya took over as Headmaster. Another earthquake in 1918 almost totally destroyed the school buildings, but the school resumed in 1919 after reconstruction. Once again the institution suffered a blow in 1926 when a fire burned down everything except the administration building. There was another fire in 1929. Khan Sahib Mofizur Rahman became Headmaster in 1934. After World War II in 1939, the school building was used by the military as a camp. Months later, when the military-backed out, the school resumed its operations. Khan Sahib was transferred to Shilchar Normal School in 1945. Upon his retirement, Srish Chandra Gupta took over followed by Abdul Gafur Chowdhury in 1947, and Chowdhury retired in 1951. Then, Syed Hafizur Rahman became Headmaster.

Luxury goods and luxury market The term luxury comes from the Latin ¬¥luxuria¬¥, which means the ¬¥extras of life¬¥.Zhan, L. (2012).

Those goods often enjoy high brand perceived quality, and are characterised by high price, superb quality, aesthetic design, heritage, reputation, exclusivity, desirability, personality. Luxuries are objects that provide positional status in society. History of fashion and luxury goods industry in the West The modern luxury fashion industry originated in France when Charles Frederick Worth arrived in Paris and invented haute couture. The emerging clothing identity was pivotal for the development of luxury goods in the 19c. The success of an haute couture house depended on the talent of a designer who owned the house and who produced made-to-order clothes for aristocracy and upper class. The social groups wanted to reflect wealth and social status. In the 19th century the industrialization of Europe gave rise to luxury brands, many of which are still existing today, such as Louis Vuitton (1854).Zhan, L. (2012). Understanding luxury consumption in China: Consumer perceptions of best-known brands.

Nowadays the purchase and the use of luxury goods has a big role to exhibit personal and social identity through independent style rather than single brands. Consumers are more au demanding, heterogeneous and sophisticated. On global scale, they increase choices in luxury products, shopping channels, and price levels. The luxury goods industry Luxury goods companies are trying to improve their competitiveness with expanding their market geographically. They are oriented towards markets such as China, which currently is the biggest market for luxury and prestige brands from the Western industries. The number of Chinese consumers who can afford luxury goods is about 1.3 billion (2012).Zhan, L. (2012) ibid., p.21-22 Chinese consumers are increasingly brand aware, and they intend to invest in luxury fashion brands. China and luxury goods consumption Luxury goods companies have to cope with the challenge of cultural and purchasing power differences in China. According to Wong and Ahuvia: ¬¥¬¥The Western rationality inherent in most consumer theories needs to be reinterpreted through the eyes of Eastern reality\\" (Wong & Ahuvia, 1998, p. 436).Zhan, L. (2012) ibid., p.23 China is culturally a collectivist country, and identities are often described as Confucian collectivism which emphases the social relationship and group welfare over individual needs. Chinese consumers are concerned with positional value consumption in their luxury fashion brand purchasing behaviour. They perceive and pursue comprehensive values associated with luxury fashion brands. Chinese consumers put more emphasis on social value brands compared with other countries. They often use material possessions and brand names to reinforce their social identity. Luxury goods are their social tools to increase distance from other social groups and to identify with peers of same social status. However personal cultural orientations can be influenced by age, social class, education and travel.Zhan, L. (2012) ibid., p.42-43 Western luxury goods companies, when entering China, should also take into consideration the Chinese multidimensional cultural orientation (heterogeneity of Chinese consumers). When cultural meanings of a luxury brand are consistent with one's cultural orientation, the consumer is more likely to form positive beliefs about and attitude towards purchasing the specific brand resulting in higher purchases. Chinese consumers are the most influenced by word-of mouth strategy when buying new goods. According to some research, collectivist consumers are likely to pay more attention to interpersonal effects of purchasing goods whereas individualist are more likely to consider the personal dimension of purchasing luxury goods, and whereas collectivist consumers tend to comply with social pressure, individualist consumers are less affected by the influence of reference groups.Zhan, L. (2012) ibid., p.150-152; Li, G. (2012). Luxury fashion brand consumers in China: Perceived value, fashion lifestyle, and willingness to pay.

Chinese luxury fashion brand consumer behavior (middle classes) With a fast growing economy and a massive population, China managed to become the most attractive markets for luxury brands in the world. The growing middle-class group in China is a main engine for luxury businesses. Increased buying power and following the trend of shopping in high quality and branding goods make these people willing to purchase mid to high end luxury products .Zhan, L. (2012). Understanding luxury consumption in China: Consumer perceptions of best-known brands. Journal of business research: JBR, Elsevier, ISSN 0148-2963, ZDB-ID 1897731. - Vol. 65.2012, 10, p. 1452-1460 [ONLINE] Available at:http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/heyanqun/files/2013/12/JBR.pdf. Due to the lack of knowledge Middle-class consumers in China buy luxury products under the recommendations of experts in the fashion industry. For Chinese people luxuries are still very much a ¬¥fetish¬¥ from ¬¥abroad¬¥. Many people buy luxuries in order to show off, and people consider each other very much on the appearance and just by the first glance .Ma, D. (2010) ‚ÄòLuxury Shopping Behaviour of Chinese Consumers‚Äô [ONLINE] Available at: Chinese people seem to purchase luxury goods to good fortune, and apparat to stren the positional value of luxury rather than personal hedonism. Chinese middle-class consumers perceive luxury brands as highly valuable possessions, and they primarily use them as a tool to meet the social expectations of important reference groups .Jaffrelot, Ch & van der Veer, P (eds) 2008, Patterns of middle class consumption in India and China, Sage Publication India Pvt Ltd, India. Available at: https://books.google.com/books?hl=sk&lr;=&id;=kuKGAwAAQBAJ&oi;=fnd&pg;=PP1&dq;=chinese+middle+class+consumption&ots;=lfSSVnvIoh&sig;=YlSc5E7lOmMrS2cF5i9uiVaFQM4&redir;_esc=y#v=onepage&q;=chinese%20middle%20class%20consumption&f;=false The best-known luxury brands are no good options for consumers who want to express their own uniqueness, probably due to the popularity of the brands. Chinese middle-class consumers are not perceived as extravagant shoppers but they prefer to buy products that will provide them with a social status. This trend also explains why Chinese consumers constitute a fast-growing market for luxury products at the same time that they save a much higher percentage of their incomes than their counterparts in other countries. Due to their culture Value Consciousness and Susceptibility to Normative influence played a crucial role luxury brands and Chinese Middle-class consumers. Those to elements helped Companies to communicate with target consumers and build marketing strategies to position a luxury brand in China. For example, a common positioning strategy used by established luxury brands in China is to place an emphasis on superior product.Atsmon Y. & Dixit V. (2009), Understanding China's wealthy, McKinsey Q (4):32‚Äì3. Due to the lack of knowledge of Chinese consumers this strategy may have worked successfully but companies are trying to focus on the ways in which the brands can help consumers accomplish their social goals. Luxury brands in China need to highlight the social meanings of their products and clearly communicate how their products can benefit consumers in important social situations and connect them with desirable social groups. The most famous luxury brand categories according to Chinese consumers China is set to become the second biggest consumer of luxury goods by 2015.http://red-luxury.com/brands-retail/the-most-popular-luxury-brands-in- china Hatssmon Y. & Dixit V.

The basic idea is that costs are designed \\"into the product\\", even from the earliest concept decisions on and are difficult to remove later. Thus costs are seen as an equally important parameter besides feature scope and schedule, the three taken together yielding the well-known project triangle. By taking the right design decisions as early as during the initiation and concept phase of the product life-cycle, unnecessary costs at later stages can be avoided. But DTC also tries to capture the necessary measures for cost control during the complete development cycle. In DTC, cost considerations also become part of extended requirements specifications.http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/ltrs-pdfs/iaa-ceso-11-90.pdf In contrast to the closely related target costing, DTC does not mean a product will exactly reach a defined cost, rather, it is about \\"considering cost as a design parameter in your product development activities\\".http://www.hillerassociates.com/design-to-value-versus-design-to- cost-versus-minimum-viable-product/ DTC can also be contrasted with Design-to- value which emphasizes the value that can be delivered to the customer, instead of the production costs for the manufacturer or company.

He has appeared in episodes of Doctor Who and in the 2010 film Clash of the Titans.  Early life  Mullan grew up in Montreal and attended Children‚Äôs Theatre in the West End of Montreal. Later he did the theatre program at John Abbott College and then Ryerson University for their Theatre program.  Career  After completing University he moved to Ottawa and worked at the Oddyssey Theatre developing skills in mask and puppet movement theatre. Mullan moved to the UK on a whim after going there on vacation. He immediately started touring with theatre companies all over Europe, the Middle East, and Asia doing musical productions of David Copperfield, Gulliver‚Äôs Travels, and Sherlock Holmes. He later transitioned to television doing puppet for a show called Dinotopia, the effects department wanted someone to animate this dinosaur and make it emote like a person. Ross also played Orsino in l, Bath Theatre Royal's production of Twelfth Night, the title role of the Selfish Giant for Leicester Haymarket Theatre and brought the critically acclaimed play Thick from the Edinburgh festival to New York City with sold out performances. Ross played the role of the 'Numbertaker' in the children's show, Numberjacks. The Numbertaker is a parody of The Undertaker, and is a live-action man (with an exaggerated top hat and a white robe), who removes numbers (or numbers of things). He also played Nev The Bear as a co-starring actor in Smile (British TV series) in 2002 and again in 2007, alongside Barney Harwood, on another show called, Bear Behaving Badly.

Six oxygen atoms are coordinated octahedrally to each bismuth atom. Through the edge-sharing of oxygen atoms, a Bi2O62‚àí layer is formed. Positively charged lead atoms are dispersed between the layers, forming a hexagonal unit cell, with a lead atom in each of the corners. Lead bismuthate is a superconductor with the formula Pb(BiO3)2. has only been discovered in recent years in the laboratory as it is not naturally occurring. Lead bismuthate forms a pentavalent structure, significantly different from the regular ionic interactions of sodium bismuthate, but similar to that of strontium bismuthate. In the structure, six oxygen atoms are coordinated octahedrally to both the bismuth and lead atoms. The bismuth and oxygen atoms form negatively charged layers by creating repeating octahedral geometries. The positively charged lead atoms are then disbursed within the layers, forming a hexagonal unit cell, with a lead atom in each of the corners. The density of the crystal is 9.18 g/cm3. The formula weight is 233.99 g/mol. The volume of the crystal structure unit is 169.26 A3. Lattice parameters (a) is 5.321 angstroms. Uses Semiconductor properties One of the first found uses of lead bismuthate was its ability to be a semiconductor. When doped with a metal that has one less electron (p-type doping) it has ability to conduct. Its coefficient of performance also increases to a range of 0.2 to 0.6. Its application as a semiconductor involves mixing Bi2O3, PbO, and SiO2, into a paint and coat solar panels with the paint. Different solvents and compositions of the three chemicals yielded different semiconducting efficiencies. Glass applications Lead bismuthate has a broad transmittance range in the IR spectra.7 When doped with Li2O to form Li2O-[Bi2O3-PbO], the transmittance can increase beyond 10-15 micrometers. The figure above shows the IR spectra of 30Li2O-35[Bi2O3-PbO] glass composition, which contains 30 mole percent Li2O. Infusing varying mole concentrations of Li2O within the structure of lead bismuthate to form Li2O-[Bi2O3-PbO] can increase the transmittance spectra of lead bismuthate glass within and beyond the visible range.7 The figure shows the UV-Vis spectra of lead bismuthate glass compositions with (a) 20, (b) 30, (c) 40, (d) 50 and (e) 60 mole percent of Li2O. Lead bismuthate glass has become highly useful in the industrial and electrical sector. Lead bismuthate glass has a density in the range of 7.639-7.699 g/cm3 and refractive index within the range of 2.47-2.9. But most importantly lead bismuthate glass has a uniquely large transmitting window, containing wavelengths in the infrared (IR) and UV- visible wavelengths. Due to this, lead bismuthate can be used in spectral devices, such as optical switches and photoionic devices, detection systems based on sensitivity to infrared (IR) and heat radiation, laser materials, optical waveguides, and crystal free fiber drawings. Though unfortunately, lead bismuthate glass cannot form on its own and is rather difficult to make. As lead bismuthate melts in the glass forming process, it becomes less stable and tends to crystallize as the temperature decreases, creating a less translucent and glossy product. Lead bismuthate has a high paramagnetic ion content. Thus the lead bismuthate in conjunction with increasing concentrations of metal cation or oxide adducts such as Fe2O3, MnO or Gd2O3 increases the stabilization effect and transmission window of the lead bismuthate resulting in the crystallization of the glass structure. For example, varying the mole percent of Li2O in the lead bismuthate glass with the formula Li2O-[Bi2O3-PbO] can increase the transmission range to wavelengths beyond 10‚Äì15 micrometers in the IR spectra and 420‚Äì450 nm in the UV-Vis spectra. Researchers are working to improve lead bismuthate by expanding the transmitting window to fit even more optical applications. Specifically, research has shown that if sufficient amounts of barium and zinc oxides are used simultaneously for the stabilization of lead bismuthate glasses, the decrease in the infrared transmission becomes insignificant compared to the stability of the glass. However, these oxides are not equal and cannot be entirely substituted by each other. Hence, both of them should be available and utilized together to minimize the crystallization and improve the glass stabilization so that there is only a slight decrease is the infrared transmission. Organic decomposer applications Lead bismuthate is photocatalytically active. It can be used for the decomposition of organic compounds under visible light irradiation. This is useful for environmental and water treatment purposes. However, lead bismuthate is not as effective at decomposing organic matter as other metal oxides or bismuthates due to its broad valence band and small band gap.

Wren (born 1936 in Romford, Essex, England) is an internationally published hymn-poet and writer. Wren's hymns appear in hymnals of all Christian traditions and have been influential in raising the awareness of theology in hymns. Brian Wren is married to Rev. Susan M. Heafield, a United Methodist pastor.  Career  Wren served in the British Army for two years (1955‚Äì1957) and then received a B.A in Modern Languages from Oxford University (1960), a B.A. in Theology from Oxford University (1962), a D.Phil. in theology of Old Testament from Oxford University (1968), and an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Christian Theological Seminary, Indianapolis (2004). His D.Phil. thesis was titled The language of prophetic eschatology in the Old Testament. He was ordained in 1965 in what is now the United Reformed Church, and initially served as the minister of Hockley and Hawkwell Congregational Church, Essex, England (1965‚Äì1970). He then served as the Consultant for adult education for the Churches‚Äô Committee on World Development (1970‚Äì1975), the Coordinator of Third World First (now known as People and Planet), and was a member of the Executive Board of the UK Aid Charity, War on Want (1976‚Äì1983). He returned to ministry as a free-lance minister (1983‚Äì2000) before becoming the Conant Professor of Worship at Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, GA, USA (2000‚Äì2007). In 2007, Wren retired from Columbia Theological Seminary and was named professor emeritus.  Thought  Wren has written a number of hymns, books, and articles focused around worship. His hymns are published and used around the world in a variety of hymnals. Wren has published seven hymn collections totaling 250 hymns, as well as collections of worship songs for congregations, which was created with his partner-in-marriage Rev. Susan Heafield. Wren was the runner up in the international Millennium Hymn Competition awarded in February at St Paul's Cathedral, London. His hymn Hidden Christ, Alive For Ever was sung at St Paul's on January 9, 2000 as part of the Cathedral's 'Millennium gift to the nation'. Wren has been a strong proponent of the view that hymns are poetry and theology, instead of simply music. He has stated, \\"a hymn is a poem, and a poem is a visual art form. The act of reading a hymn aloud helps to recover its poetry and its power to move us‚Äîthe power of language, image, metaphor, and faith-expression.\\" It is through this power that he defined theology, in his book Praying Twice: The Music and Words of Congregational Song, as \\"done when anyone attempts, by artistic skill and creativity, the interplay of intellect and imagination, and/or the methods of reasoned enquiry, to grasp, know and understand the meaning of God‚Äôs creating, self-disclosing and liberating activity centered and uniquely focused in Jesus Christ.\\" A major part of Wren's work has been with inclusive language as well. In 1978, he began to look more closely at \\"he-man language\\" and began using language inclusive of women and oppressed or subordinate groups in his hymns. He has since sought to challenge the church to adopt this inclusive mindset. He writes that the vocation of a poet in the church is to not only \\"to write poems of faith which people will pick up and sing,\\" but to also \\"speak truth by stepping beyond the church's limits of comfort and convention\\".

Li is known for the 2001 expose of a Chinatown extortion ring. She has also reported on the 2002 SARS (bird flu) crisis and the 2015 Ellen Pao gender discrimination lawsuit. Biography Li, a native of Hong Kong, is the daughter of a Hong Kong businessman. After graduating from journalism school in Taiwan, she worked for three years for Hong Kong's largest daily newspaper Oriental Daily News. Li came to the US in 1984, continued her education with a master's degree from Utah State University, and started reporting in San Francisco for the World Journal. She was one of the speakers at the Ascend conference sponsored by the Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs Association (APAPA), the Asian Studies Department of the City College of San Francisco, the Japan Policy Research Institute and the Center on the Pacific Rim at USF, and the Stanford Center for East Asia Studies. Li has repeatedly been awarded for her journalism. Investigative and campaigning journalism A Wall Street Journal leader column described Li as one of the \\"firebrand journalists\\" of the American ethnic press. Among the stories she has investigated was a series of fires in San Francisco in 2001 that destroyed restaurants owned by ethnic-Chinese businessmen. According to the Wall Street Journal, Li's interview with one of the owners who informed her that gang members had demanded protection money and her subsequent reports identifying gang links to the arson generated tips leading to the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrest of several suspects on charges of extortion. San Francisco Police Chief Fred Lau said, \\"Portia was going 120 miles an hour,\\" during a press conference, \\"We said, 'Hey, maybe this [her investigation] is something that people are interested in.'\\" Li is active in highlighting the issue of Chinese ethnic discrimination to Chinese communities worldwide in articles published by the World Journal. According to the Wall Street Journal column, Li raised questions about racial bias in her articles on behalf of Rep. David Wu, a Democrat from Oregon who was denied entry to the U.S. Energy Department by guards who questioned his nationality. She also challenged an inflammatory editorial likening the Chinese-American physicist Wen Ho Lee to \\"Fu Manchu\\". During his investigation, she published many articles described as helping to \\"galvanize the Chinese-American community\\". \\"Portia was way out in front,\\" stated Policy Director of Chinese for Affirmative Action Ted Wang. Reporters and editors from three Chinese-language American newspapers, including Li, received an apology in 2007 by then presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton for an apparent snub at a fund raiser when the reporters were considered \\"foreign press\\".

She participated in the U.S. Navy's first efforts in coaling warships while underway at sea. She was rammed by a commercial steamer in the early morning hours of 9 August 1910 and sank that afternoon without loss of life. Acquisition and commissioning The USS Marcellus was built by Mounsey and Foster, South Dock, Sunderland, England. Originally christened as SS Mercedes, she was launched on 5 April 1879 for the British shipping firm Adamson & Ronaldson. In September 1881 she was purchased by the Dutch Stoomvaart Maatschappij Insulinde and renamed SS C. Fellinger. In 1886, she was obtained by Adolf Kirsten's Hamburg Pacific Dampfschiffs Linie (HPDL) and renamed as SS Titania. In 1898, she changed owners again when HPDL sold its ships to their competitor, Deutsche Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft Kosmos. She was purchased from William Lamb by the United States Navy on 13 June 1898 for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and named for Marcus Claudius Marcellus. As was the practice of the time, many colliers purchased to support the war were named for classic characters. Commissioned as USNA Marcellus in Boston, Massachusetts on 28 September 1898, with Lieutenant Commander J. H. Winslow in command. Service history Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898 Marcellus coaling the cruiser at sea in 1899 During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, following a brief cruise along the east coast, Marcellus sailed from Lambert's Point, Virginia on 4 January 1899 to carry coal and supplies to American forces at Havana, Cuba. At the end of the war, she returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard and her guns were removed. She was subsequently placed in reserve on 8 March 1899. In November 1899, outside Sandy Hook, the first real recorded underway replenishment (UNREP) at sea was performed by the U.S. Navy using the Marcellus and the battleship . This was achieved by the Massachusetts taking Marcellus under tow 300‚Äì400 feet astern while steaming along at six knots. The system, devised by Spencer Miller and the Lidgerwood Manufacturing Company of New York, allowed the crew to deliver one 800 pound bag of coal per minute via a cableway strung above the tow cable. While this provided for around 20‚Äì24 tons of coal to be transferred per hour, that amount still fell short of the Navy's requirement for 40 tons per hour. For the next 15 years, the U.S. Navy continued to experiment with coaling at sea, eventually developing a rig that could reliably complete this mission. Atlantic Fleet, 1900-1910 From 1900 to 1910, with her homeport near Newport News, Virginia area coal piers, she transported coal along the east and gulf coasts, between New Orleans and Maine, and to ports in the Caribbean, in support of the Atlantic Fleet. Beginning in January 1900, she operated for five months along the Atlantic coast, carrying coal to Norfolk, Virginia until being placed in ordinary on 4 May 1900 for a 30-day repair period. Upon completion of repair on 11 June, Marcellus accompanied the fleet to Newport, Rhode Island. In November 1900, her cargo of coal caught fire due to spontaneous combustion. After 1500 tons were removed, it was thought to be extinguished. However, it rekindled later in December. In order to ensure it did not reignite, workmen removed the remaining 600 tons. The Navy initially authorized the necessary work to restore Marcellus to serviceable condition. However, this work was suspended to allow important work on other ships to be completed. Marcellus remained in reserve until 25 November 1902, when repairs were finally completed and she again returned to transporting coal along the Atlantic seaboard, the Gulf Coast and ports in the Caribbean. Marcellus put into port at Norfolk on 2 March 1904, after long service in tropical waters, for refitting and overhaul. Her crew of merchantmen was discharged at that time and she was placed out of commission. Recommissioned in August, this time with a full complement of U.S. Navy officers and enlisted men under the command of Lieutenant Commander George H. Stafford, she again resumed transporting coal along the east coast. In May 1905, Marcellus was again used to test an improved method for coaling at sea. The experiment, this time near Cape Henry, involved refueling the battleship . While the coaling tests at sea achieved a record of thirty five tons an hour steaming at a seven knot speed, the new rig still fell short of Navy expectations. In December 1907, along with , , and , Marcellus accompanied the Great White Fleet from Hampton Roads, Virginia to Port of Spain, Trinidad, the first refueling stop along the fleet's circumnavigation of the world. Placed out of service, 25 January 1908 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, she was back in service by 3 April 1909 with her Navy crew replaced by merchantmen. For the next 16 months, she served both as a collier and as a training ship for deck and engineering personnel. Collision and loss at sea In August 1910, Marcellus and another collier, , were ordered to Guantanamo Bay, for which they cleared Delaware Bay on 7 August. At 2:30 in the morning on 9 August, while 60 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, Marcellus was rammed by the Norwegian-flagged fruit steamer . Just over 10 hours later, Marcellus sank with no loss of life, her crew and their belongings having been safely transferred to the Leonidas. The official naval court of inquiry concluded the fault lay with the Rosario di Giorgio, and recommended the government seek recompense from her owners for the value of the Marcellus and her cargo, then placed at 125,000. Deemed too expensive to salvage, Marcellus was struck from the Navy list on 22 September 1910. Coincidentally, that was the same day that Rear Admiral Winslow, her first captain, was retired from active duty on account of his age.

After the Sergeants' Revolt on September 3, 1933 and the proclamation of Fulgencio Batista as the new Army Chief of Staff, replacing Julio Sanguily Echarte, the higher ranking army officials (such as captains, coronels, and generals) refused to recognize this proclamation. Suffering from a hemorrhaging ulcer in his stomach at the time, Sanguily would rest at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba. In addition to Sanguily, the United States ambassador, Sumner Welles was also staying at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba. Given the importance of Sanguily, who in the eyes of the higher ranking army officials, was the legitimate Army Chief of Staff and on the other hand the fact that the U.S. ambassador himself was staying at Hotel Nacional, it followed that the Hotel Nacional was the perfect place for the army officials to regroup and put Ramon Grau's government in a deadlock. On September 8, 1933, United States Ambassador to Cuba at the time, Sumner Welles telegraphed the following to the United States Secretary of State, > The Hotel Nacional in Habana, where many of the American colony are living > at the present moment and to which I myself have moved since the lease on my > house expired, has been decided upon today by the Cuban Army officers as > headquarters. Approximately 500 officers fully armed are in the hotel.

It is said by most scholars that the fighting began on the side of the soldiers surrounding the Hotel Nacional. The army officials had approximately 400 men, whereas the soldiers were 2,000 strong. Despite these differences in number, the officials had some key advantages, namely the positioning of the Hotel Nacional relative to the soldiers surrounding the Hotel. It was quite clear that the numerous windows of the Hotel provided the army officials better positioning than the soldiers who would be clearly visible from any of the Hotel's windows. Secondly, many among the officials were expert shooters; many had fought during the Cuban War of Independence of the late 19th century. These advantages were reflected in the battle, that after 11 hours of fighting conservative casualties place the number of soldiers dead at least 30, whereas only 2 army officials were killed in the brawl. The next day two units of the Navy bombarded the Hotel Nacional de Cuba. With low munitions and the impossibility of resistance, the army officials capitulated. After the surrender, probably due to high casualties suffered by the soldiers, approximately a dozen of the high-ranking officials were murdered in cold- blood by the soldiers.

It was established in 1890. An earlier structure, built on the east side of Sixteen Mile Creek, had burned down. The west side of the river, where artisans lived, was a more welcoming environment for Oakville's \\"Black Church\\". It is telling that the church was named after Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, as he was an advocate of the back-to- Africa movement, and the first black chaplain, appointed by Abraham Lincoln, during the American Civil War. The escaped slaves were seeking to escape the penalties of the fugitive slave laws which were passed in the United States in the early nineteenth century. Many of the escapees were skilled tradesmen and one of their number developed the technology that made \\"stoneboating\\" possible. Stoneboating was a system where ships could grapple for slabs of sedimentary rock which could then be cut and prepared for building materials. The stratification of the rock, a natural process over eons of time, made for regularly shaped \\"brick-like\\" material which had the virtue of being easy to form and consistent in shape. In fact, it was an ideal supply for local stonemasons. The Original Corner Stone. The Brick face of the church to the near of the property. It would be an error to think of the newcomers as indigent. Through their intelligence and their craftsmanship they began to have sufficient capital to invest in homes, farms, and a place of worship that was distinctly their own. Rather than copy the places of worship they had known in the southern states they were impressed by the churches of east Oakville. That's likely why they chose red brick for the structure complete with \\"flying buttresses\\" which, in essence, are strictly ornamental rather than functional. The floor area of the church is little over 1000 square feet and it was built on sand. This method of building had the virtue of providing complete drainage and keeping the structure free of moisture and the possibility of mold.  Oakville Heritage Society plaque  Oakville Heritage Signage. Outside the present day building there is a sign erected by the Oakville Historic Society. It reads:  Later years  New stained glass windows. Turner Chapel served as a community centre for the Afro American immigrants as well as a place of worship. Gradually, however, the members of the congregation began to disperse to other communities and in the later years of the twentieth century the property was leased to an offshoot of the Anglican Church with a small congregation of twelve members and a bishop. The Anglicans sought funding for renovations and the church, which was in danger of toppling because a weakened foundation, was repaired and outfitted with central heating and air conditioning. Money was also raised to replace the original windows with new stained glass and leaded panes. In 2000 the owners of the Church placed the property on the market. The single lot housed both the church and the newer (1930's) manse. The site was ignored by developers because of the rigorous demands of the historic designation on the church. In effect, the church structure could not be modified or changed in any way. In 2002 Jed Gardner, a local antique dealer, decided to purchase both properties to be the location of his expanding business. Gardner worked with the Oakville Historical Society to accommodate the new purpose and the building was restored in a suitable manner and preserved for future generations to enjoy.

London: Lockwood & Co., 1866. 335. Print.] and an example of a force-pump possibly used for a fire-engine is mentioned by Heron of Alexandria. The fire pump was reinvented in Europe during the 16th century, reportedly used in Augsburg in 1518 and Nuremberg in 1657. A book of 1655 inventions mentions a steam engine (called a fire engine) pump used to \\"raise a column of water 40 feet [12 m]\\", but there was no mention of whether it was portable. Colonial laws in America required each house to have a bucket of water on the front stoop during fires at night. These buckets were intended for use by the initial bucket brigade that would supply the water at fires. Philadelphia obtained a hand-pumped fire engine in 1719, years after Lynn's 1654 model appeared there, made by Joseph Jencks, but before New York's two engines arrived from London. Knox fire engine, one of the first modern fire engines, manufactured in 1905 in Springfield, Massachusetts by the Knox Automobile Company. By 1730, Richard Newsham, in London, had made successful fire engines; the first used in New York City (in 1731) were of his make (six years before formation of the NYC volunteer fire department). The amount of manpower and skill necessary for firefighting prompted the institution of an organized fire company by Benjamin Franklin in 1737. Thomas Lote built the first fire engine made in America in 1743. These earliest engines are called hand tubs because they are manually (hand) powered and the water was supplied by bucket brigade dumped into a tub (cistern) where the pump had a permanent intake pipe. An important advancement around 1822 was the invention of an engine which could draft water from a water source doing away with the bucket brigade. Philadelphia fire engine manufacturers Sellers and Pennock model the Hydraulion is said to be the first suction engine produced in 1822.Rorer, Beverly, and Barbara Marinelli. Images of America: Upper Darby. Charleston, S.C.: Arcadia Pub., 2011. 112. Print. Some models had the hard, suction hose fixed to the intake and curled up over the apparatus known as a squirrel tail engine. The earliest engines were small and were carried by four men or mounted on skids and dragged to a fire. The earliest four-wheel carriage mounted engines were pulled to the fire by hand. As the engines grew larger they became horse-drawn and later self-propelled by steam engines. John Ericsson is credited with building the first American steam-powered fire engine. John Braithwaite built the first steam fire-engine in Britain. Until the mid-19th century, most fire engines were maneuvered by men, but the introduction of horse-drawn fire engines considerably improved the response time to incidents. The first self-propelled steam-driven fire engine was built in New York in 1841. It was the target of sabotage by firefighters and its use was discontinued, and motorized fire engines did not become commonplace until the early 1900s. The dawn of the 20th Century brought about the age of the motorized fire apparatus. One of the first self-propelled fire engines of that era was introduced in 1903 for the Niagara Engine Company of New London, Connecticut, however it was driven by a steam-powered engine, as opposed to an internal combustion engine which would prove to be much more popular. By 1905, the idea of combining gasoline engine motor trucks into fire engines was attracting great attention; according to a Popular Mechanics article in that year, such trucks were rapidly gaining popularity in England. That same year, the Knox Automobile Company of Springfield, Massachusetts began selling what some have described as the world's first modern fire engine. A year later, the City of Springfield had an entire modern fire department supplied with Knox fire engines. In 1906, the Waterous Company introduced a fire engine with two gasoline-powered engines, one for propulsion and the other for pumping. For many years firefighters sat on the sides of the fire engines, or even stood on the rear of the vehicles, exposed to the elements. This arrangement was uncomfortable and dangerous (some firefighters were thrown to their deaths when their fire engines made sharp turns on the road), and today nearly all fire engines have fully enclosed seating areas for their crews. Types of apparatus *Aerial firefighting apparatus **Helitack *Fireboat *Fire bike *Fire engine **Quint **Wildland fire engine **Airport crash tender *Water tender **Wildland water tender *Heavy rescue vehicle *Light and air unit *Hazardous materials apparatus  Characteristics   Color  Due to the need for firefighting apparatus to be highly visible, they are, similar to other emergency vehicles, painted in conspicuous colors, such as white, yellow, orange, or red most frequently and famously, fire engine red. While red remains the most common color for firefighting apparatus, it is not required and depends highly on individual needs, traditions, and safety research. For example, the Chicago Fire Department has a long-standing tradition of painting their apparatus black over red, a practice that has caught on far beyond Illinois. Neighboring departments will also often use different colors to distinguish their apparatus. For example, the Santa Barbara Fire Department uses the traditional fire engine red while the neighboring Santa Barbara County Fire Department elects to use white with blue stripe. Some, like the Denver Fire Department use less common colors like all- over white with stripes, gold in Denver's case. Most fire apparatus use retroreflective markings to increase their visibility in poor light; red and white or red and yellow chevrons on the rear are almost universal, and while most choose a more modest and arguably stylish option in simply making existing stripe patters reflective, some, particularly European fire services and especially those in the United Kingdom, choose to have very large and prominent markings. Others still, such as the Munich Fire Department have replaced red with similar but more visible colors, such as fluorescent orange. A study by the American Psychological Association published in February 2014 indicated that lime-yellow is a significantly safer color for emergency vehicles because of its increased visibility. The study showed that lime- yellow fire apparatus were half as likely to be involved in accidents as red vehicles. Audible and visual warnings Active visual warnings of a North American-type fire appliance Passive visual warnings involve the use of high contrast patterns to increase the noticeability of the vehicle. These types of warnings are often seen on older vehicles and those in developing countries. More modern designs make use of retroreflectors to reflect light from other vehicles. Vehicles will also often have these reflectors arranged in a chevron pattern along with the words fire or rescue. European countries commonly use a pattern known as battenburg markings. Along with the passive warnings, are active visual warnings which are usually in the form of flashing coloured lights (also known as \\"beacons\\" or \\"lightbars\\"). These flash to attract the attention of other road users as the fire appliance approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped appliance in a dangerous position on the road. Additionally the lights are accompanied by loud sirens. Wail, Yelp and Phaser electronic tones from a Whelen(R) siren unit In addition to visual warnings, most appliances are also fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people to the presence of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted on the front or roof of the truck. Most vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different sounds. Fire service driving training often includes the use of different sounds depending on traffic conditions and maneuver being performed. For instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the \\"wail\\" setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy slow traffic, a \\"yelp\\" setting may be preferred, which is like a wail, but faster. A fire truck using an air horn while responding The speakers for modern sirens can be located in several places on the vehicle, including being integral to the lightbar, or hidden in the grille. Some vehicles may also be fitted with airhorn audible warnings. The \\"acoustic\\" or \\"air\\" traditional sirens are still in wide use, most notably on North American-type fire apparatus but other countries such as Japan have fitted their apparatus with these types of warning systems as well, as its overtones help the public \\"locate\\" and avoid the fire truck‚Äîthe newer electronic signals disperse almost pure electronic sine wave tones, which are hard to locate, especially in city \\"canyons\\" of buildings. Furthermore, \\"air\\" sirens are generally much, much louder. In Chile, many vehicles are fitted with three types of audible warnings, which are sounded all at once: the classic \\"air\\" siren, the electronic \\"yelp\\", and the European two-tone air horns (sometimes newer vehicles are fitted with the electronic version of the latter, commonly called \\"Hi-Lo\\"). A development is the use of the RDS system of car radios, whereby the vehicle can be fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, in the manner of a traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into all RDS radios for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence, although is not able to alert pedestrians and non-RDS radio users.

Specifically, she was the first woman appointed as a United States Diplomatic Officer or Consular Officer, in 1923; the U.S. would not establish the unified Foreign Service until 1924, at which time Diplomatic and Consular Officers became Foreign Service Officers. Biography Curtis, n√©e Atcherson, was born on October 11, 1894, in Columbus, Ohio. Curtis graduated from Smith College in 1913 and later did graduate and research work at Ohio State University and the University of Chicago. She supported women's suffrage, joining a five thousand woman march through Columbus, Ohio, in 1912 in support of a constitutional amendment to give women the right to vote. She later became the first Columbus woman to join the National Women's Party and helped organize the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1917 Curtis volunteered overseas with the American Fund for the French Wounded; in 1918 she was transferred to its new civilian division, called the American Committee for Devastated France, which sought to rebuild eleven villages and give medical and social services. Lucile was eventually transferred to Paris to become director of personnel there for the Committee, and in December 1919, she was given the Medaille de la Reconnaissance Francaise for her work. In 1920 she became the first woman to apply to be tested to join what became the U.S. Foreign Service. Although she passed, and in 1922 President Warren G. Harding nominated her as the first woman in what became the U.S. Foreign Service, the Senate did not approve her appointment because its members did not think it was appropriate for a young single woman to travel overseas as a diplomat. She worked in the Department of State then, mostly in the Division of Latin- American Affairs. But after women's and political groups supported her with letters and telegrams, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations recommended her appointment overseas and the Senate approved it in 1923. Lucile thus became a U.S. diplomat based in Bern, Switzerland, officially titled \\"third secretary of the legation\\" in Bern. After serving in Switzerland, Lucile was assigned to the U.S. Legation in Panama in early 1927. In summer 1927, she wrote a letter to the legation's personnel chief asking when she would be promoted and noting that men had been promoted ahead of her; soon after this, the personnel board gave its members a bleak summary of her work, stating in part, \\"Her sex [is] a handicap to useful official friendships.\\" She resigned later that year, although it was not because of her lack of promotion but because she disliked Panama and was in a serious relationship with her future husband. In 1978, the State Department had a day honoring Lucile and diplomat Clifton Reginald Wharton Sr. Columbus, Ohio celebrated a day in her honor the same year. Personal life On January 6, 1928 Lucile married George Morris Curtis with whom she had two children; Charlotte Curtis and Mary Curtis Davey. Lucile Atcherson Curtis died on March 6, 1986. Legacy Lucile's papers are held at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, a research library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University.

She then departs to the home of the children's great-uncle, who is a sorcerer astronomer and possesses a magical book that takes people to the land of fairy tales. Abracadabra was developed based on an old desire of Xuxa to produce a film with children's language. Abracadabra, is a fantasy for children. Xuxa always wanted to make a movie that combined fairy tale and folklore in a fun way. The idea was to put together, in a single script, several characters of children's stories.

Abracadabra received negative reviews from critics, but was considered an improvement in quality compared to previous ones.  Plot  Sofia (Xuxa Meneghel) is a librarian and book specialist for children. One Saturday night, she's getting ready to go out with her best friend (Helo√≠sa P√©riss√©) when she gets a phone call.

The story is complicated because Sophie and the children, being from the real world, disturb the fairy tales, causing everyone to \\"turn around\\". This powers the secret villain so that he can get all the monsters in the horror stories to invade the enchanted forest, conquering it, and threatening the real world as well. Sofia saves the two children but then finds herself in a dilemma.

Xuxa e os Duendes was a film directed to the public juvenile-child, but that pleased the minors. The reverse path is occurring: a movie for the children, which will please the larger ones as well. Abracadabra, is a fantasy for children. The idea was to join, in a single script, several characters of children's stories. The hostess, who appears to unite the tales, becomes the true princess, entitled to kiss the Prince Charming. Recounting the inspiration of making the film, Williams said: Xuxa I always wanted to make a film that combines fairy tale and folklore in a fun way. When Diler Trindade [producer] brought the screenplay of Fl√°vio de Souza, [writer R√°-Tim-Bum Castle], Xuxa approved the idea - It was the reason for TV hots to stop in the sequel to films about elves, which was considered to have a third sequence, and start working on Abracadabra. With Moacyr G√≥es as director, G√≥es, was challenged to escape the \\"caricature\\" tone that he sees in Brazilian children's productions. G√≥es says that when he accepted Trindade's invitation to direct the film, he started to study cinema watching productions from all walks of life. \\"In 2002, I saw about 800 films, from Eisenstein to 'Clueless'.\\" The filmmaker said he had no problem in suffering prejudices because he integrated a film production format of declared commercial ambition. To live the roles of the real \\"world\\", that of Sofia, and those of fantastic character, was cast a cast of 39 actors, many known from TV. The recordings began in September 2003 and lasted four weeks. To live the main characters of the film, were called Helo√≠sa P√©riss√© (Patricia), Brunno Abrah√£o (Lucas), Maria Mariana Azevedo (J√∫lia), Debby Lagranha (Little Red Riding Hood), Kayky Brito (Puss in Boots) and Leandro Hassum (Bluebeard / The Frog Prince) among others. The character Mateus, interpreted by Marcio Garcia, was the romantic pair of Xuxa, in this production, Xuxa revealed that kissing with the actor in the film was not technical, \\"There is a technical kiss yes, and I have already tasted the two.\\" The non-technical, for those who are not actress like me is much better. are very similar, the scene becomes more real if you give a real kiss.\\" Luciano Szafir was initially cast to live the character Mateus, however the production felt that people could confuse the story with the last film: Xuxa e os Duendes 2 in which he made pair romantic with Xuxa. Claudia Raia plays Evil Queen, according to the actress \\"Xuxa called me saying she had a villain role for me. I said my dream was to be Snow White's stepmother\\". The Rouge group, which makes a special participation. The members of the Rouge group appear in the movie making a show at a nightclub at a particular point in the plot. The singers spent a day in Rio de Janeiro, where the recordings were made. Release The premiere of the film occurred on December 12, 2003, at the Parque Mundo Xuxa, in the SP Market Shopping Center, in the South Zone of S√£o Paulo, Xuxa wanted to follow closely the preview of the film. \\"Father and mother are going to have a good laugh as well. It's a cool program to eat popcorn and to fall behind \\"- said Xuxa at the press conference. The presence of TV hots Xuxa Meneghel, caused rampage in the place and left a young woman injured. According to park press secretary Marcelle Canfild, Rita de Cassia Basile, 21, attempted to circumvent the safety of the site in an attempt to approach the hots, when a grid surrounding the fans fell. The girl stumbled and had her leg immobilized amidst the push-shoving of the fans. The young woman suffered a twist in her right knee, was rescued by the local fire department and sent to the Pedreira hospital. \\"The doctor advised her to put ice on the wound and keep her leg suspended for a few hours,\\" Marcelle said. The premiere in Rio de Janeiro, occurred on December 15, 2003, but this time did not count the presence of Xuxa, only with some actors in the cast of the film. The film was released on December 19, 2003. As the film's release, Xuxa posed with the cast of the film, on Angra dos Reis Island, for Caras magazine. At the time Xuxa, he injured a small accident during a story he made on Caras Island. She was taking pictures with fans when the deck she was sank into and cut off her right leg. Taken in her private helicopter to the hospital Copa D'Or, the \\"Queen children\\" received 11 points in the leg.

Reception Critical reception Like previous Xuxa films, Abracadabra received low acclaim from critics, but were positive compared to the previous ones. Marcelo Forlani of the Omelete site, was critical of the production that he said was \\"once again hastily done, without the least concern for pre-production. characters, are free of any three-dimensional depth, have as main defect the total absence of coherence\\". He also criticized the team responsible for the makeup in Abracadabra \\"writing it is one of the worst seen in the cinema\\". The beard of the pirate Bluebeard is more false than a note of R$13.50 reais and the monsters wear costumes that seem to have been rented in a And the worst of it, the color of the fake nose used by Claudia Raia when she becomes the Evil Queen is quite different from her skin\\". concluding that the \\"film only proves how much the Brazilian people still need to grow culturally\\". writing for Epipoca, Rubens Ewald Filho considered the film \\"less execrable than the others, in this, there is even a figure in animation, the talking cricket of \\"Pinocchio\\", which has a nice intervention. He also praised the participation of the actors, but considered them poorly used in the film. But it was negative in his review writing that \\"the film was made in a hurry, with little money and relative commitment, the set design is very bad and there is only one minute of external\\". The dialogues are extremely bad and bland. won a few more amusing phrases was Claudia Raia, in the role of Snow White Stepmother, which at least has a few moments of brilliance, the rest falls in the common grave. Writing to the Uol Site, the same critic considered Abracadabra, a bit less bad than the previous one. But not much. Nor anything significant. At least we are free from those terrifying makeup (but not from the unfortunate costumes, Xuxa spends most of the time with an unfortunate prom dress that only serves to disrupt her). Writing for ISTO√â, Mariane Morisawa praised the quality of the film, writing that \\"The film is not enough to be Shrek, who plays very cleverly with the fairy tales, but represents a breakthrough for Xuxa. Rather than Xuxa e os Duendes 2\\". Similarly, a critic of the Estad√£o, praised the film considered it superior in relation to the previous one, writing that \\"Xuxa is more beautiful in Abracadabra than in the two Duendes 2, the effects of the film are more taken care of\\". The audiences surveyed for AdoroCinema gave the film a three- star rating of five with a 2.9-point rating. The audiences surveyed for IMDb, gave a score of 1.8 points to the film. The audiences surveyed for Filmow, gave a score of 1.8 points to the film, based on 2793 votes. In√°cio Araujo for Folha, said that contrary to previous productions, Abracadabra tries to separate children from consumers, \\"A not inconsiderable effort in a film by limited definition, since it consists in trying to distinguish between children and consumers, a distinction that apparently never Xuxa bothered to establish\\". Box office \\"Xuxa Abracadabra\\" was potentially considered a popular success by the media, even before it was released. With annual releases, the films of TV hots Xuxa Meneghel remained among the best box office of Brazilian films. After succeeding in launching two films dedicated to his adolescent audience, Xuxa decided to devote himself to producing films for his children's audience, the first release Xuxa e os Duendes, was the only Brazilian film to exceed the 1 million mark viewers in Brazil in 2002, as well as the phenomenon City of God by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund (3.2 million). Its sequel Xuxa e os Duendes 2 (2002) reached 2,301,152 box office in 2003, being the fifth Brazilian production most seen in Brazil in 2003.

Hazan was the second legislator in the history of the State of Israel to be suspended, with MK Haneen Zoabi being the first one. Hazan placed 35th in the pre-April 2019 Israeli legislative election Likud primaries, a slot thought to have been too low to have a realistic chance for getting reelected to the Knesset. He therefore re-established the Tzomet party and ran on its list in the elections.https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001273753 His new party garnered only 0.06% of the vote and did not win any seats. Ironically, Likud did end up winning 35 seats, meaning that if Hazan had remained in the Likud party he would have been reelected to the Knesset. Controversy  Of the Palestinians, Hazan stated in the Knesset: \\"We're gonna shut your mouths, and we're going to speak the truth. There is no Palestinian People. And there has never been a Palestinian People [in Hebrew, Am Ha'Falastinai]. ...\\"Bradley Burston 'Five Ways Israel Will Make You Hate Israel This Week,' Haaretz, 8 March 2017 Hazan said that the Jewish people had been around for 3,500 years since Abraham and Isaac, while the Palestinian people had only been around for 40 years since Yasser Arafat. In November 2015, Hazan was suspended from the Knesset for a month after accusing Meretz MK Issawi Frej of double voting, after Yesh Atid MK Karin Elharar asked for assistance as she has muscular dystrophy. In December, 2017, Hazan stopped a bus on its way to Nafha Prison, telling the Palestinian relatives that the prisoners were \\"terrorists who belong in the ground\\".

Then interior minister Arye Deri echoed his position, but some other politicians and public figures such as Shelly Yachimovich, Yoel Hasson, and Idan Raichel reacted negatively to Hazan's comments, describing them as racist. Personal life Shortly after his election in 2015, Channel 12 reported that Hazan had hired prostitutes and used hard drugs during a trip to Bulgaria. Hazan sued for libel, but the lawsuit was thrown out of court because the reportage was deemed \\"responsible, serious journalism and reflected the reality as it was\\".

He was twice married and used bogus requests for references on household help to obtain signatures of men of note. He was jailed for various infractions including bigamy, perjury and fraud. Life Young was born about 1657, possibly at Warrington, then in Lancashire, and educated in Ireland. He himself, in one of his unveracious accounts of his career, states that he was educated at Enniskillen school, Co. Fermanagh, and afterwards at Trinity College, Dublin, but his name does not appear on the list of graduates. In 1675 he married Anne Yeabsly, and five years later, though she was still living, he went through the form of marriage with Mary, daughter of Simon Hutt, a Cavan innkeeper, who was thenceforth the favoured companion in his wanderings and accomplice in his crimes. Career Soon after 1680 Young managed to procure admission to deacon's orders at the hands of John Roan, Bishop of Killaloe, whom he circumvented by forging certificates of his learning and moral character. He obtained a curacy first at Tallogh in the county of Waterford, \\"whence for divers crimes he ran away on another man's horse, which he never restored\\". From his next curacy at Castlereagh, Co. Roscommon, he \\"was forced to flee for getting a bastard\\". While at Kildallon in the diocese of Kilmore he was delated to the bishop, Francis Marsh, afterwards Archbishop of Dublin, \\"for many extravagances, the least of which was marrying without banns or license\\". He now fled into the diocese of Raphoe, but was taken up for bigamy and imprisoned first at Lifford, then at Cavan. From gaol he wrote to both his wives, comparing himself to David, and assuring each of them that she alone was the object of his love. He succeeded in inducing his first wife not to appear against him, and seems to have been allowed benefit of clergy. Detained for non-payment of prison fees, he managed to procure his release by pretending to Ormonde (the \\"Popish Plot\\" being then in the air) that he could make disclosure of serious plots against the government. \\"The Scotchman\\", as Marsh calls him in a letter to Bishop Sprat, then ran away to England with his second wife. In England they operated at first under the name of Green, perambulating the country with forged testimonials, purporting to be in the hand of the archbishop of Canterbury. At Bury St. Edmunds, on 6 October 1684, they were pilloried as common cheats. From Bury gaol, on 30 September 1684, Young had written a long letter to Archbishop Sancroft, with an entirely novel account of his parentage and early life, expressing his mortal hatred of \\"discentors, especially that damnable faction of Presbytery\\", and stating that he had been put upon \\"the hellish and durty stratageme\\" of forging testimonials by one Wright, a non-existent \\"scrivener of Oxford\\". Failing in his object, he vowed to be revenged on the archbishop. As soon as he was released he forged a new set of testimonials with a dexterity which was generally admitted to be marvellous, and set to work, with a new alias and a new story, collecting large sums of money from wealthy clergymen, including three bishops who were intimate with Sancroft, and believed that they recognised his hand. At length in 1687 the imposture came under the notice of the archbishop, who caused to be inserted in the London Gazette (September and October 1687) advertisements warning the charitable to beware of Mrs. Jones and Robert Smith (i.e. Young and his paramour). Young next gave himself out as a grave Irish clergyman of good preferment, but a victim of Tyrconnel's persecuting fury; some funds were necessary to support this character, and these he seems to have obtained by a series of highly successful frauds at St. Albans, where he had secured the corrupt connivance of the postmaster. Forming a design of a wealthy marriage, Young was now anxious to get rid of Mary Hutt; but at this juncture the pair were betrayed to one of their victims, and lodged in Newgate on a charge of forgery. They escaped with the pillory and a fine, owing to lack of evidence; but, the fines remaining unpaid until 25 May 1692, they remained in prison for upwards of two years. During the western rebellion Young had stood false witness against a number of presbyterian divines, but his evidence had been disbelieved. While lying in Newgate he determined upon reverting to this branch of his profession and fabricating a sham plot, and with this object in view he addressed himself in the first instance to Tillotson. The archbishop mentioned his allegations with all reserve to William, who treated them with disdain. Young was temporarily disconcerted; but when at the end of April 1692 William left England for the Low Countries, and when the nation was agitated by apprehension of French invasion and Jacobite insurrection, Young's hopes revived. By writing in feigned names to ask after the characters of servants or curates, he had accumulated a collection of autographs from men of note who were suspected of disaffection. With consummate calligraphic skill he now drew up a paper purporting to be an association for the restoration of the banished king. To this document he appended the forged signatures of Marlborough, Cornbury, Salisbury, Sancroft, and Thomas Sprat, bishop of Rochester. The owners of the first four names were already under the suspicion of the government. With regard to Sprat it was well known that there was more of the opportunist than of the conspirator in his composition. Why Young selected the ease-loving bishop to be the pivot of his plot was probably because he had been prospecting round Bromley in 1690, and knew that ingress into the palace was easy. Young himself could not quit Newgate, and he selected as his emissary a rogue named Stephen Blackhead, whose ears had suffered in the pillory. Blackhead conveyed to the bishop a letter carefully forged by Young from an imaginary doctor of divinity. Highly pleased with the terms of the letter, the bishop told his butler to treat the messenger well. Blackhead, affecting great reverence for the entourage of a bishop, asked the butler to show him Sprat's study, with a view of concealing the traitorous document among the papers on the episcopal table. Failing in this, he had finally to content himself with dropping the \\"association\\" into a flowerpot in a disused parlour. Young now demanded to be heard before the privy council on a matter of the greatest import. He had timed his plot to a nicety. The government were overweighted with anxiety. They thought Young's story plausible enough to order Sprat's arrest, and messengers were sent down to Bromley on 7 May 1692 with a warrant from Nottingham to take the bishop into custody, and to search his apartments for the signed instrument in which the alleged conspirators avowed their aims. Young particularly requested that the officers might be ordered to examine the bishop's flowerpots. Hence the incident was referred to by Lady Marlborough and others as \\"the flowerpot plot\\" (see Brewer, Historic Note Book). Very fortunately for the bishop the forged document was not found, and after ten days' detention Sprat was suffered to return to Bromley. In the meantime Young had sent Blackhead to recover the paper, which he thereupon forwarded to the secretary of state (Romney), with an ingenious explanation. The bishop was recalled before the council (10 June 1692) and confronted with Blackhead. Finding the bishop's story corroborated by his servants at all points, and greatly relieved by the victory of La Hogue, the privy councillors turned sharply on Blackhead, who lost his nerve and finally blurted out the truth. But Young was utterly unabashed; he repudiated Blackhead, and denied that he had given directions for the flowerpots to be searched. He declared that the bishop had bought off his accomplice, and that they were trying to stifle the plot. Sprat, conscious that he had perhaps narrowly escaped the block, upbraided Young for his unprovoked malignity. He replied with as much cunning as effrontery, \\"All is not confessed yet. A parliament will come, and then you shall hear more from me\\" (Sprat, Relation, pt. ii.). Another temporary sufferer, but eventual gainer, by Young's false accusation was the Duke of Marlborough, now promptly released from the Tower. On his return to Newgate Young attempted to suborn a half-starved wretch named Holland to take Blackhead's place, and to support him with newly devised evidence against Marlborough and Sprat. Holland having reported this scheme to Nottingham, Young was prosecuted by the attorney-general for perjury. Blackhead absconded after promising to turn King's evidence, thus delaying the trial until 7 February 1693, when Young was sentenced at the king's bench to be imprisoned and to be thrice set in the pillory, where he had to undergo a very severe pelting. Having effected his escape from the King's Bench Prison on 12 December 1698, Young seems to have turned to coining for a livelihood, and early in April 1700 he was arrested for this offence and tried at the Old Bailey. He was found guilty on 12 April, under the name of John Larkin alias Young. The \\"evidence against him\\", says a contemporary news-sheet, \\"were two fellow prisoners whom he had invegled to assist him in the act of coyning, with design to accuse them, and to witness against them, in hopes to purchase his liberty, but they turned evidence against him, upon which he was condemned. He was very dexterous in counterfeiting People's Hands, having counterfeited the Hands of both the Sheriffs for the discharge of a prisoner\\" (London Post, 15 April). He made a \\"penitent\\" end at Tyburn on 19 April 1700, confessing that he had forged the plot against the bishop of Rochester (Flying Post, No. 772). In a \\"Paper delivered by Robert Young\\" to John Allen, the ordinary of Newgate, and published on 20 April 1700, the criminal frankly confesses \\"I have injured my Neighbour so often by Forgeries, Cheats, &c.;, that I think it is scarce possible to recount them\\". Writing to Lord Hatton in March 1693, Charles Hatton said of Young, whose trial he witnessed: \\"In impudence he far outdid even Dr. Oates. He had not a ranting impudence, but a most unparalleled, sedate, composed impudence, and pretends to be as great a martyr for his zeale for the preservation of the present government as Oates did for his for the protestant religion\\" (Hatton Corresp. ii. 190).

A London Jew named Abraham was described in 1277 as being from \\"La Gelnseye\\" (Guernsey). A converted Portuguese Jew, Edward Brampton, was appointed Governor of Guernsey in 1482. Guernsey's Jewish population has historically been much smaller than that of neighboring Jersey, and there has never been a synagogue on the island. Background Guernsey (; Guern√©siais: Guern√©si) is an island in the English Channel off the coast of Normandy. It lies roughly north of Saint-Malo and to the west of Jersey and the Cotentin Peninsula. With several smaller nearby islands, it forms a jurisdiction within the Bailiwick of Guernsey, a British Crown dependency. The jurisdiction is made up of ten parishes on the island of Guernsey, three other inhabited islands (Herm, Jethou and Lihou), and many small islets and rocks. The jurisdiction is not part of the United Kingdom, although defence and most foreign relations are handled by the British Government. The entire jurisdiction lies within the Common Travel Area of the British Islands and the Republic of Ireland, and although it is not a member of the European Union, it does have a special relationship with it, being treated as part of the European Community with access to the single market for the purposes of the free trade in goods. Taken together with the separate jurisdictions of Alderney and Sark it forms the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The two Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey together form the geographical grouping known as the Channel Islands. World War II Enemy aliens, people born in a country with which Britain was at war, were restricted from entering Britain without a permit. Accordingly, a few Jews became trapped in Guernsey when the islands were occupied. In addition, a few locals decided to remain in Guernsey rather than evacuate in June 1940. During the occupation of the Channel Islands by Nazi Germany during World War II, laws were imposed on the authorities that required registration. All non Guernsey and British foreigners (aliens) had already been required to register with the police, but the records did not mention their faith. An advertisement appeared in the newspaper in October 1941 calling on all Jews to identify themselves. The Germans issued identity cards to everyone, which listed their nationality and faith. Jews identified in Guernsey and Sark * Elda Brouard n√©e Bauer, 27/4/1884, British by marriage, born Italy * Elisabet Duquemin n√©e Fink, 21/7/1899, British by marriage, born Austria * Auguste Spitz, 28/8/1901, German, born Austria * Therese Steiner, 22/4/191625 German, born Austria * Anny (Annie) Wranowsky, 22/4/1894, Czech but held German passport, living on Sark Marianne Grunfeld, born in Poland in 1912, had studied horticulture at the University of Reading before going to work on a farm in Guernsey. She was identified in April 1942 as Jewish. Theresia Steiner, an Austrian, non-practising Jew, who had come to the Islands from England and become trapped in the Islands by the invasion as she had been detained as an alien, amongst 30 enemy aliens who were arrested and detained in June 1940. She didn't have a UK visa to go to the UK as required for immigrants from Germany and Austria (from 1938). A qualified dental nurse, she was then employed as a nurse by the States of Guernsey, working at the Castel Hospital, She went, after 18 months to the German authorities to ask to contact her parents. The First Order Against The Jews was 23 October 1940 and this was the beginning of the adoption of the Nuremberg Race Laws in to the Channel Islands‚Äô legal systems. The Islands' bailiffs collaborated with the Germans. Only Sir Abraham Lain√© protested against the anti-Jewish laws. The deportation of the Jews from the Channel Islands was with the full connivance of the bailiffs and the government authorities. According to the grandson of Bailiff Carey of Guernsey, Winston Churchill did not know whether to hang William G. Carey or knight him. To hush up the level of collaboration, he was knighted and the history of Guernsey's delivery of the Jews to the Nazis was concealed for decades. Guernsey plaque to Marianne Grunfeld, Auguste Spitz and Therese Steiner The first group of three Jews were ordered to leave the Island in April 1942. The three, Marianne Grunfeld, Auguste Spitz, and Therese Steiner, were first sent to Saint-Malo, where they took up local employment, Marianne Grunfeld was reported to be living in Laval, France, until three months later when they were rounded up in a mass deportation of French Jews. They were sent directly to Auschwitz, where they all died. The second group of three, Elda Brouard, Elisabet Duquemin, and Janet Duquemin (18 months old), were sent with Henry Duquemin (husband of Elisabet) in February 1943. Henry was sent to Oflag VII-C in Laufen, Germany, and the two women and baby went first to a prison in Compi√®gne and then after 6 months to Ilag V-B in Biberach an der Riss. Both of the camps in Laufen and Biberach were civilian camps containing many Channel Island civilians. Annie Wranowsky lived on Sark throughout the war working as a German language teacher. Miriam Jay lived in Guernsey throughout the war without being identified. Sir Geoffrey Rowland, the Bailiff of Guernsey from 2005 to 2012, has stated that the government of Guernsey was powerless to stop the deportations due to the large number of German soldiers on the island. Current There are still some Jews living in Guernsey today, some of whom attend the congregation in Jersey. The present- day Channel Islands community, consisting of some 60 Jews was founded in 1962.

They may opt for either of these alternatives, or both. A small number of dentists are employed by the NHS but the vast majority are in private practice. Payment systems Dentists who work for the NHS are paid by Units of Dentistry Activity, which are bands of treatment. This system was established in England and Wales in 2006. Before that payment was for activity, which encouraged treatment but did not incentivise preventative work. England NHS England began procurement for 363 orthodontics contracts in 2017. In December 2019 the British Dental Association and the Association of Dental Groups asked for the contracting process to be stopped. Some had already been abandoned. Wales The Welsh Government launched the Designed to Smile scheme in 2009. This is a preventative programme where new parents are provided with toothpaste and toothbrushes and encouraged to take their child for a dental appointment before their first birthday. Older children are encouraged to brush their teeth in school and free fluoride varnish treatment is made available. The Welsh National Assembly‚Äôs Health, Social Care and Sport Committee published an inquiry into the system (which is not identical to the systems in the rest of the UK) in May 2019. They felt that there was a disincentive for dentists to take on patients who need extensive dental treatment.  Education and registration  In the United Kingdom, dentists complete 5 years of undergraduate study to earn a B.D.S. or BChD degree. After graduating most dentists will enter a V.T. (vocational training) scheme, of either 1 or 2 years length, to receive their full National Health Service registration. Dentists must register with the G.D.C. (General Dental Council), and meet their requirements as the governing body of the profession, before being allowed to practice. The Dentists Act 1957 defines dentistry with the intention of confining the practice of dentistry to those on the Dental Register. It provided the following definition: \\"For the purposes of this Act, the practice of dentistry shall be deemed to include the performance of any such operation and the giving of any such treatment, advice or attendance as is usually performed or given by dentists.\\" There are sixteen dental schools in the UK, five of which are graduate entry programmes, only admitting applicants with at least an upper 2.1 in a classified undergraduate degree with a significant component of biomedical sciences. Thus the competition for places is fierce (approximately 1 successful candidate admitted in every 26 applicants in 2013).Dentist Entry Requirements, hosted on Prospects website. Page accessed 30 October 2011 Because of the low numbers of dental schools, funding for building and service developments in the schools can be very high. Well known UK universities providing dental courses are the Universities of Leeds, Liverpool, Glasgow, Cardiff, Queen's Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Dundee, Manchester, Plymouth, Sheffield, Queen Mary, London and King's College London. As of 2013, the only UK universities offering a 4-year graduate-entry BDS programme are Liverpool, King's College London, BLSMD, UCLan and Aberdeen.

Trotter was best known for conducting the John Scott Trotter Orchestra which backed singer and entertainer Bing Crosby on record and on his radio programs from 1937 to 1954, as well as his work with Vince Guaraldi scoring Peanuts animated television specials and feature films between 1966 and 1975. Early life Trotter was born John Scott Trotter, Jr. on June 14, 1908, in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was born to parents John Scott Trotter (June 26, 1881 - August 8, 1949) and Lelia Trotter (n√©e Bias) (May 10, 1885 - July 7, 1965). Trotter attended local schools in Charlotte. He also studied piano under Ida Moore Alexander. In 1925, Trotter entered the University of North Carolina. It was there that Trotter began his career as a professional musician playing the piano for a college band led by Hal Kemp. Kemp had entered the university in 1922 and was graduated in 1926, but Trotter withdrew near the end of his first year to join Kemp's band as pianist and arranger, a position he held until 1936. Career After leaving Kemp's band, Trotter did some work in Hollywood where he handled the orchestrations for Columbia Pictures Pennies from Heaven which was his first work with Bing Crosby. This would start a 17-year professional association with Crosby, although Trotter and Crosby had first met in 1929 in New York City at the Manger Hotel while Crosby was working with Paul Whiteman's orchestra. Trotter recalled the background to his involvement with Pennies from Heaven in an interview with Canadian broadcaster Gord Atkinson. He had been asked by Johnny Burke if he wanted to do the orchestrations for the film. This was one of the first independent film productions. Crosby was then under contract to Paramount but Pennies from Heaven was done at Columbia as an independent and nobody was set to do the music. Trotter told Burke that he hadn't come out to work and that seemed to be that. A week later, Burke asked, 'Would you help Arthur Johnston with the piano parts?' After much persuasion, Trotter helped Johnston with the piano parts and fell in love with the score which included Pennies from Heaven, So Do I, and One, Two, Button Your Shoe, and also the Skeleton in the Closet. He then decided to complete the orchestrations as the offer was still open. Trotter recalled that the day Pennies from Heaven was recorded, the cameras were rolling with the orchestra on stage; it was not prerecorded as would be usual today. John Scott Trotter considered that Crosby was a past master of lip syncing but it wasn't done in those days. After completing Pennies from Heaven Trotter went back east.\\" In July 1937, Trotter replaced Jimmy Dorsey as the musical director for Crosby on NBC's radio program Kraft Music Hall. That same year, Trotter began arranging and conducting songs for Crosby's records for Decca. Their first recording together, It's the Natural Thing to Do, reached the No. 2 spot in the charts of the day and they had many hits over the ensuing years. Trotter would remain Crosby's musical director until 1954. The involvement with the Kraft Music Hall came about when Larry Crosby, Bing's brother and public relations director, sent Trotter a wire asking if he could be in Hollywood on June 28, 1937 to take over the orchestra of the Kraft Music Hall on July 8. Although Trotter had rehearsed and directed orchestras, he had never had an orchestra of his own, with his own name. The first time he appeared under his own name 'John Scott Trotter and his Orchestra' was on the Kraft Music Hall with Bing Crosby. The Kraft Music Hall went fifty weeks a year and Trotter did one hundred and forty consecutive Thursdays without missing one; some sort of record. Bing Crosby talked very warmly about Trotter in his 1953 autobiography Call Me Lucky and commented about Trotter's remarkable self-control. Trotter also had orchestra related responsibilities. Jerry Colonna was a trombonist for the band and future entertainer Spike Jones served as a drummer. Trotter moved on to television, becoming musical director for The George Gobel Show from 1954 to 60. He served as musical director of several of Crosby's television specials as well as his 1964-65 ABC situation comedy, The Bing Crosby Show. Peanuts Beginning with It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown in 1966, Scott arranged and directed music scores for 11 Peanuts television specials and one feature film in conjunction with composer Vince Guaraldi. His final work, You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown, was broadcast on October 28, 1975‚Äîone day before his death. Trotter was nominated for an Oscar award and a Grammy award for his musical score for the 1969 feature film, A Boy Named Charlie Brown. Death Trotter died of cancer on October 29, 1975, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. He was buried in Sharon Memorial Park in Charlotte. Surviving him were a sister, Margaret Kinghorn, and two brothers, William and Robert Trotter. Legacy and criticism Carroll Carroll, who was the chief writer of Kraft Music Hall, recalled Trotter's massive volume and appetite when it came to his everyday life; Trotter, along with Jack Kapp, has been criticized for mainstreaming Crosby's style away from his jazz roots. The reality is that Crosby himself chose the songs he performed on his radio shows and had ultimate approval for anything he recorded to disc. Crosby could have worked with any musical arranger he chose, but he preferred working with Trotter for 17 years.

It was invented by Joseph DeSimone, Alexander and Nikita Ermoshkin and Edward T. Samulski and was originally owned by EiPi Systems, but is now being developed by Carbon.  Process  The Continuous Liquid Interface Production method uses ultraviolet light to harden a photosensitive resin while the fabricated object is drawn up out of the resin bath. The continuous process begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the \\"window\\"). An ultraviolet light beam shines through the window, illuminating the precise cross-section of the object. The light causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow the resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. An oxygen-permeable membrane lies below the resin, which creates a ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù (persistent liquid interface) preventing the resin from attaching to the window (photopolymerization is inhibited between the window and the polymerizer). Unlike stereolithography, the printing process is continuous. The inventors claim that it can create objects up to 100 times faster than commercial three dimensional (3D) printing methods.  Applications  CLIP objects have smooth sides, unlike 2015 commercial 3D printers, whose sides are typically rough to the touch. Some resins produce objects that are rubbery and flexible, that could not be produced with earlier methods.  History   Patents and trademarks  CLIP was, at the time the original patent was filed, an acronym for Continuous Liquid Interphase Printing, described in two patents, titled 'Continuous liquid interphase printing' and 'Method and apparatus for three-dimensional fabrication with feed through carrier'. Both patents were filed February 10, 2014, by EiPi Systems, Inc as Applicant with the following individuals titled as 'inventors': Joseph DeSimone, Alexander Ermoshkin, Nikita Ermoshkin, and Edward T. Samulski. According to data in the California Secretary of State's office database, Carbon is listed as of September 6, 2014. A trademark was filed on September 10, for the 'CARBON3D' trademark. Public release A journal article was published in Science detailing the groups' findings. At a TED talk in March 2015, DeSimone demonstrated a 3D-printer prototype using CLIP technology and produced a relatively complex object in less than 10 minutes, 100 times faster than other 3D printing techniques. DeSimone cited a scene in the 1992 film Terminator 2: Judgement Day, where the T-1000 machine reforms itself from a metallic pool, as an inspiration for the technology's development.

He earned a doctorate in chemistry from Harvard University in 1933. In 1934, he created the Massachusetts State Police Chemical Laboratory - the first statewide crime detection lab in the country. Later the Chemical Laboratories of the Department of Public Safety, he ran it until his death. During that time, Walker developed many of the scientific techniques essential in modern crime detection. His eulogy in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology states \\"Throughout the world his methods are used, his name is known, and all men benefit.\\"Richard Ford, \\"Joseph T. Walker, Ph.D. 1908-1952,\\" Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Vol. 43, Issue 4, Article 11 (1953) Lawyer-turned-mystery-writer Erle Stanley Gardner dedicated the foreword to one of his books to WalkerErle Stanley Gardner, \\"Foreword\\" The Case of the Fiery Fingers (New York, William Morrow & Co, 1951) pp v-vii. and commented, upon hearing of his death, that Walker was \\"the greatest real life detective\\" he had known.\\"Dr. Joseph T. Walker: Medico-Legal Chemist for the State Police Was 44,\\" Daily Boston Globe, April 30, 1952, p. 23. Early life and education Born in Saint Louis, Missouri, Walker attended Kirkwood High School before earning a BA in chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1930. That year, he also took a few graduate courses.Joseph Thomas Walker's Transcript, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1930.] Soon, however, as the Great Depression worsened, he went back to school. In 1932, he enrolled in a doctoral program in chemistry at Harvard University and graduated in less than a year.Joseph Thomas Walker, Dissertation ‚ÄúSynthesis in Allene Series‚Äù 1933 (From the Harvard University Archives, Call Number HU 90.2598) Meanwhile, during his undergraduate years at Illinois, he had met and fallen in love with fellow Illini, Lola Jeanette Muns. Since the DuPont Fellowship which supported him at Harvard forbade recipients from marrying during their studies, the two were hastily wed in 1932. Their life together ‚Äì which produced two children (Janet in 1935 and Thomas in 1940) - lasted until his death in 1952.‚ÄúDr. Joseph T. Walker, Medico-Legal Chemist for State Police Was 44,‚Äù Daily Boston Globe, April 30, 1952, p. 23. Career When Walker began his career in 1934, scientific crime detection was still in its infancy. Though Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler had been doing forensic science for New York City for over a decade, they had often faced roadblocks erected by various corrupt city governments.Deborah Blum, The Poisoner‚Äôs Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in the Jazz Age (New York, Penguin Press, 2010) Walker, on the other hand, the first person to create a state crime lab, would work in a very supportive environment. Though originally housed in a small room in the Massachusetts State House, his lab was quickly moved to spacious accommodations and equipment and supplies were forthcoming as needed. In addition, he earned rapport with the Massachusetts State Police and the all- important authority to secure crime scenes - a relatively new concept - by taking basic police training in 1936. Walker also gained an academic platform when crime detection enthusiast/philanthropist Frances Glessner LeeCorrine May Botz, Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death (New York, Monachelli Press, 2004). gave Harvard a large endowment to fund a Department of Legal Medicine where, from 1939 onward, he taught toxicology. In addition, Ms. Lee proselytized about the virtues of the type of work he was doing by holding multi-day seminars on the subject around the country. Just before his death she would tell Walker that \\"No other lecturer has helped individuals and the whole training program as you have.\\"Letter from Frances Glessner Lee on behalf of the Harvard Associates in Police Science to Joseph. T. Walker, July 24, 1951. Walker pursued his work with determination. On one occasion, he had a coffer dam built in a river downstream from a bridge from which a bagful of human bones had been dropped. This move paid off when, after the water had been drained, a bullet with striations linking it to the suspect‚Äôs weapon was found.Information provide by his son Thomas W. Walker and verified by his daughter, Janet Walker McCabe, April 4, 2015 And there was the internationally publicized \\"Case of the Merry Widow\\"Massachusetts vs Oscar Bartolini, 299 Mass. 503, February 7, 1938- February 28, 1938, Norfolk County. in 1936 concerning the murder and dismemberment of socialite Grayce Asquith. Solving this one involved identification of basic blood type and the first ever use of a toe print (in blood under a tub) in a criminal trial. Fairly straightforward, but others were not. In 1945, prominent lawyer John Noxon was convicted of electrocuting an infant son born with Down Syndrome. Though Noxon claimed that the death had been an accident, Walker proved the father‚Äôs guilt by revealing that there were microscopic quantities of copper from an electrical cord on both the infant‚Äôs body and a metal tray.Massachusetts vs John F. Noxon, 319 Mass. 495, October 23, 24, 1945-May 10th 1946, Berkshire County. Walker wrote journal articles to promote his ideas and techniques. In 1937 he published \\"Chemistry and Legal Medicine\\" in the New England Journal of Medicine.Joseph T. Walker, \\"Chemistry and Legal Medicine,\\" The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 216, Issue 23, pp. 1024-1027. In it, he argued that all states should have crime labs and listed ways that chemistry could be used in crime detection. Towards the end of the article, he recommended the use of a new technique he had developed for use in shooting cases. Whereas, previously, powder burns had been detectable only in cases where the person had been shot at close range, his test would reveal the \\"entire powder pattern from shots fired at a much greater distance ‚Ä¶ by locating each individual grain of powder in the exact position in which it lies upon the cloth.\\"Joseph T. Walker, \\"Chemistry and Legal Medicine,\\" The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 216, Issue 23, pp. 1026-1027. He also authored or co-authored a series of journal articles describing his new techniques. Among these, were: \\"The Spectrograph as an Aid in Criminal Investigation,\\"Joseph T.

Final years Walker would die of Hodgkin‚Äôs disease in April 1952 ‚Äì probably the result of breathing benzene fumes in his own laboratory. Though terribly ill, he kept to a full schedule of work for most of his last two years. For Instance, in 1950, he travelled to Maine first to teach twenty-five State policemen about the uses of science in crime detection and then to testify at the retrial of a deputy sheriff convicted of murder in 1938.

There was a community in Jersey from the 1840s. The Jersey Old Hebrew Congregation was founded in 1843 and closed around 1870. As of 2015 there were about 85 Jews living in Jersey, although the number was shrinking. World War Two Enemy aliens, people born in a country with which Britain was at war, were restricted from entering Britain without a permit. Accordingly, a few of Jewish faith became trapped in Jersey when the islands were occupied. In addition, a few locals decided to remain in Jersey rather than evacuate in June 1940. Following the invasion of 1940, Jersey was forced to pass laws by the German occupiers, requiring the identification of Jews.

A full-brother to Hors La Loi III he began his racing career in his native country before being transferred to England to compete in National Hunt racing. In his first season in Britain he won two of his six races over hurdles including the Mersey Novices' Hurdle. In the following year he won five consecutive races including the Rendlesham Hurdle before finishing second in the Stayers' Hurdle and then returned after a twelve-month absence to win the Stayers' Hurdle at the second attempt in 1996. When Cyborgo began to compete in steeplechases in 1997 he won four of his first five races including Mildmay Novices' Chase but never won again. He was retired from professional racing 1999 and died two years later at the age of eleven. Cyborgo was noted for his front-running style and produced many of his best performances on soft or heavy going. Background Cyborgo was a bay horse with a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs, bred in France by Fran√ßois Cottin. His sire Cyborg, was a thoroughbred who specialised in producing jumpers. Cyborgo's dam Quintessence (described in some sources as a Selle Fran√ßais), was a non- thoroughbred mare by virtue of being descended from a mare of unknown parentage. Quintessence also produced Cyborgo's full-brother Hors La Loi III, winner of the 2002 Champion Hurdle. Racing career 1993/1994 National Hunt season: novice hurdle races After racing on the flat in France in 1993, Cyborgo was sent to England to be trained by Martin Pipe at Nicholashayne near Wellington, Somerset. During his British career he was owned by HUgh Duder, who raced the horse in the colours of his business County Stores Holdings (Somerset) Ltd. On his National Hunt debut Cyborgo started a 33/1 outsider for a novice hurdle for four-year-olds at Chepstow Racecourse on 25 January 1994 when he finished second behind his more fancied stablemate Devil's Den. A week later, ridden by Richard Dunwoody he started favourite against twenty-three opponents over two miles five furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse and won by eight lengths. He finished second when odds-on favourite at Ludlow Racecourse on 3 March and fell at the second last of a three-mile event at Chepstow two weeks later. At Aintree Racecourse in April Cyborgo was moved up in class for the Grade II Mersey Novices' Hurdle over two and a half miles on heavy ground. The odds-on favourite was Large Action who had shown exceptional form for a novice by winning the Tote Gold Trophy and finishing third, beaten two and quarter lengths by Flakey Dove in the Champion Hurdle. Cyborgo started 8/1 second choice in the betting alongside the Irish challenger Monalee River. Dunwoody sent Cyborgo into the lead from the start and the gelding maintained his advantage until overtaken by Large Action and Monalee River at the third last. As his rivals began to struggle in the testing conditions, Cyborgo rallied to regain the lead near the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from Monalee River, with Large Action one and a half lengths back in third. For his final run of the season, Cyborgo returned to his native France and finished fourth behind Topkar in the Prix Amadou at Auteuil Hippodrome on 26 April. 1994/1995 National Hunt season Cyborgo started his second season (in which he was partnered by Dunwoody in all his races) in minor, long distance handicap hurdles against more experienced opponents. He began at Cheltenham Racecourse in December where he carried a weight of 162 pounds and led from the start to win by seven lengths from Ivy Road and followed up at Uttoxeter a month later, again making all the running and winning \\"easily\\" by six lengths under top weight of 168 pounds. A week later, he won again under 168 pounds in a more valuable handicap at Ascot Racecourse beating Island Jewel by five lengths after Dunwoody employed the usual front-running tactics. On 25 February Cyborgo was stepped up in class for the Grade 2 Rendlesham Hurdle over three miles on heavy at Kempton Park Racecourse and started 8/11 favourite in a five-runner field. His opponents were the French horse Bog Frog (winner of the Prix Leon Rambaud and third in the Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil), Top Spin (Winter Novices' Hurdle), Cabochon (Ascot Stakes) and Allegan (runner-up in the Yorkshire Cup). Cyborgo led from the start, went clear of his rivals approaching the penultimate flight of hurdles, and won by fifteen lengths from Top Spin, to whom he was conceding fourteen pounds. On 16 March 1995, Cyborgo made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival and started 3/1 second favourite behind the Irish six-year-old Dorans Pride for the 24th running of the three-mile Stayers' Hurdle, with the other contenders including Hebridean (Long Walk Hurdle), Bokaro (Corsa Siepi di Milano), Simpson (Premier Long Distance Hurdle) and Halkpous (Fighting Fifth Hurdle). Cyborgo led for most of the way before being overtaken two hurdles out and finished second of the eleven runners, three lengths behind Dorans Pride. 1995/1996 National Hunt season Cyborgo was off the course for a year before returning for the 1996 Stayers' Hurdle in which he was ridden for the first time by David Bridgwater. Halkopous, Hebridean, Simpson and Top Spin were among his opponents but none were seriously fancied in the nineteen-runner field. The Tipperkevin Hurdle winner Derrymoyle started 4/1 favourite ahead of Better Times Ahead (Premier Long Distance Hurdle), Seekin Cash and Treble Bob (Champion Novice Hurdle), with Cyborgo next in the betting on 8/1 alongside the Long Walk Hurdle winner Silver Wedge. Other fancied runners included the (Champion INH Flat Race) winner Tiananmen Square, the fourteen-year-old veteran Mole Board and the mare Mysilv, whose thirteen wins included the Triumph Hurdle and the Tote Gold Trophy. Racing on firmer ground than he had previously encountered, Cyborgo led until he was overtaken by Seekin Cash at the eighth but regained the advantage when his rival made a bad mistake at the next. At the second last, he was passed by Mysilv but remained in touch as the two drew away from the other contenders. On the run-in Cyborgo rallied strongly under a \\"frantic\\" ride from Bridgwater to retake the lead from the mare and won by three quarters of a length, with a gap of ten lengths to the 33/1 What A Question in third. After the race Pipe said that he had been very confident about the Cyborgo's fitness, despite the gelding's lengths absence. On his only other start that year, Cyborgo started 9/10 favourite for the Tipperkevin Hurdle at Punchestown Racecourse in April, but, after leading until the second last, he tired and finished fourth behind Derrymoyle, What A Question and Minella Gold. 1996/1997 National Hunt season: novice chases In the following season, despite Bridgwater's belief that the gelding \\"won't be a chaser\\", Cyborgo was mainly campaigned in novice chases and won four of his five races. He made his debut over fences in a minor event on heavy ground at Newton Abbot Racecourse on 20 January almost nine months after his last appearance. Ridden for the first time by A. P. McCoy he started odds-on favourite against sixteen opponents, disputed the lead for most of the way, and drew away over the last two fences to win by twenty lengths. Dunwoody was back in the saddle in February, when Cyborgo won twice as odds-on favourite: he beat Buckhouse Boy by six lengths at Newbury, and then won by nine lengths (again from Buckhouse Boy) at Chepstow. At the 1997 Cheltenham Festival, Cyborgo bypassed the major novices' events and was matched against the best chasers in Britain and Ireland in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, and was the subject of a considerable ante-post gamble in the betting market. Ridden by Charlie Swan he started at odds of 12/1 in a fourteen-runner field which included Imperial Call, One Man, Danoli, Dorans Pride and Barton Bank. After being held up in the early stages he made some progress at half way, but weakened in the closing stages and came home last of the eight finishers behind the 20/1 outsider Mr Mulligan. At Aintree in April Cyborgo was returned to novice company for the Grade 2 Mumm Mildmay Novices' Chase. Ridden again by Dunwoody, he started 13/8 favourite against six opponents including Bear Claw (EBF Novices' Handicap Hurdle), The Last Fling and Buckhouse Boy. Cyborgo disputed the lead with Bear Claw and Crown Equerry before gaining the advantage at the eleventh fence. The Last Fling emerged as his only serious challenger but made two jumping errors and Cyborgo ran on to win by three and a half lengths with the outsider Judicious Captain being the only other runner to complete the course. Later career In the following season Cyborgo was ridden by McCoy in all three of his races. On his debut he started 3/1 favourite for the Welsh National at Chepstow on 27 December but was pulled up at the second-last fence of a race won by Earth Summit. He produced much his best effort of the season at Cheltenham a month later when he ran second to See More Business in the Pillar Property Investments Chase finishing well ahead of Rough Quest and Barton Bank. His performance led to his odds for the Cheltenham Gold Cup to be cut from 40/1 to 14/1. On his second attempt to win the Gold Cup, Cyborgo started 10/1 fourth favourite behind Doran Pride, See More Business and Suny Bay. He was travelling well before breaking down and pulling up before the seventh. As McCoy swerved to the right to prevent the lame horse from attempting to jump the fence he badly hampered See More Business, forcing the second favourite wide of the fence and out of the race. According to Robin Oakley, See More Business's trainer Paul Nicholls had to be physically restrained from confronting Martin Pipe. Cyborgo returned to hurdling for his first run of the next season in December but made little impression in the Long Walk hurdle and was tailed off when he was pulled up before the second last in a race won by Princeful. In January he again contested the Pillar Chase but came home last of the four finishers behind Cyfor Malta, Go Ballistic and See More Business, twenty-four lengths behind the winner. Cyborgo was pulled up in his three remaining National Hunt races: the Grand National Trial (after disputing the lead for most of the way), the 1999 Grand National (as a 50/1 outsider) and a handicap chase at Uttoxeter in May. Three months later it was announced that the horse would be retired from National Hunt racing. His owner Hugh Duder said \\"Cyborgo gave us and a lot of other people an enormous amount of pleasure. But he has been telling us he needs a rest. I'd like to pay tribute to Martin Pipe, whose training of the horse was brilliant, and to his lass Delphine Gulla, who loved him and looked after him so well.\\" Pipe called Cyborgo \\"a brilliant horse... He really was terrifically tough and had so much ability\\". After leaving the Pipe stable, Cyborgo moved to Hawick in Scotland and entered the ownership of Simon and Phillipa Shirley-Beavan and ran without success on the amateur Point-to-point circuit. He then became a hunter with the Jedforest Hunt in the Scottish Borders and was reported to have enjoyed the change in career. In March 2001, however, he suffered an inflamed colon and was euthanised at the age of eleven.

The solver must cut out the three rectangles and reassemble the pieces so that the two jockeys appear to be riding the two donkeys. Famous Trick Donkeys is a puzzle invented by Sam Loyd in 1858, first printed on a card supposed to promote P.T. Barnum's circus. At that time, the puzzle was first called \\"P.T. Barnum's trick mules\\". Millions of cards were sold, with an estimated income for Sam Loyd of $10,000 from 1871 --about $200,000 in 2014 dollars. History In 1858 Sam Loyd thought of a puzzle card that consisted on two mules and two riders. Dividing the card into three pieces the player had to place the cards in a way that each mule had one rider on. In 1871 after he had published The Wonderful Chinese Pony Puzzle, Sam decided to publish his mules puzzle renaming it the \\"Puzzle of the Trick Mules\\". P. T. Barnum saw the opportunity to promote his show on this puzzle card and offered ten thousand dollars to Sam Loyd to change the name of the puzzle to \\"P.T. Barman's Trick Mules\\" Later on, and after Loyd had offered the puzzle to other firms, it was renamed again to \\"Famous Trick Donkeys\\", which sold more than 100,000,000 copies. Today The Sam Loyd Company owns the rights to the puzzle and released a commemorative puzzle card in 2016, 145 years after it was first published. Puzzle The printed card of the puzzle shows two donkeys, the central part of which has been left blank on purpose. The third part of the card are the riders, and the objective of the puzzle is to arrange the three pieces (the two donkeys and the riders) so the riders are mounting the donkeys. Variations In the 1857 version of the book The Magician's Own Book or the Whole Art of Conjuring there appears a picture of two dogs laying on the ground facing opposite sides. Called \\"The Dead Dog Puzzle\\" the objective was to draw 2 lines which make the dogs seem to be alive, instead of lying in the ground. In 1939 another variation of the puzzle was found as a prize of a popcorn company in their packages, the puzzle showed two mules and two cowboys. This time the mechanics of the game were the same as Sam Loyd's, other companies used a tiny card with this puzzle as a gift, like the Hotel Wellington in Albany in the 50s. Today, many puzzle and mind- teasers websites offer the puzzle as an online game or a print-friendly version of it. Solution The solution The solution for the puzzle is that of the two horses drawn the head and back of each is not the one linked with lines. The head for the first horse is the back of the horse on the other side of the card and vice versa. To solve the puzzle the two horse pieces are placed in a way that the back of the horse on the first piece is facing the back of the horse on the second piece. In the gap between should be slid the jockey's piece of paper, thus forming an image on which a horse is running to the left and the other to the right, one upside up, and the other upside down.

The film is a fictionalized account of the Battle of Derna at Derna, a coastal town in modern eastern Libya in April 1805 against Tripoli, one of the four Barbary states in North Africa and stars John Payne, Maureen O'Hara, Howard Da Silva, Phillip Reed, Grant Withers, Lowell Gilmore and Connie Gilchrist. The film was released on November 9, 1950, by Paramount Pictures. Plot In 1805, the USS Essex is part of a blockade of the port of Tripoli by the small United States Navy Mediterranean squadron, targeting pirates menacing American shipping. American diplomatic Consul William Eaton (Herbert Heyes) comes on board to recruit a small commando squad for a secret mission. Lt. Presley O'Bannon, of the U.S. Marine Corps (John Payne) and Lt. Tripp (Lowell Gilmore) volunteer to raise a force to seize Derna, a strategic coastal town to the east. Hamet Karamanly (Phillip Reed), exiled former Pasha of Derna, supplies men in exchange for being restored to his throne which was taken by his brother. Countess Sheila D‚ÄôAreneau (Maureen O'Hara) stays with the Pasha, and everyone presumes she is his mistress, while she angles into persuading him to marry her. O'Bannon recruits a native force of mercenaries - Greeks, Turks and Arabs - to accompany his Marines and some American soldiers and Navy midshipmen. O'Bannon and Countess D‚ÄôArneau meet and are attracted to each other, but both refuse to admit it to themselves. D‚ÄôArneau convinces Hamet that the Americans plan to turn him over to his brother, but O‚ÄôBannon gets him to change his mind. D‚ÄôArneau defies O‚ÄôBannon and accompanies the expedition from Alexandria, Egypt, across the North African deserts, but he forces her to travel with the camp followers. After a waterhole is poisoned, the expedition has to cross a dune sea to reach the next waterhole ahead of the poisoners. O‚ÄôBannon kisses the countess and the force has to endure a sandstorm. Hamet‚Äôs brother offers him a deal: half the kingdom in return for getting rid of the Americans. They reach the coast twelve days late and the American navy squadron under Commodore Samuel Barron is not yet there. There is almost a mutiny before the ships arrives. Hamet tells his brother the plan of attack on Derna. When the countess learns of this, she rides to warn O‚ÄôBannon. He leads a surprise attack on the city and captures it. Lt. O‚ÄôBannon and the countess become a couple.  Cast  *John Payne as Lt. Presley O'Bannon, USMC (1776-1850) *Maureen O'Hara as Countess Sheila D'Arneau *Howard Da Silva as Capt.

The most common fight total cited by Hollandersky was 1039, but as Abe fought additional exhibitions he increased the count, thus a few sources that interviewed him after the publication of his book quote higher totals.\\"The greatest number of fights in a career is 1039 by Abraham Hollandersky, alias Abe the Newsboy, in the fourteen years from 1905 to 1918.

In his role as newsboy to the Navy he met, worked or corresponded with four Presidents, at least two Secretaries of the Navy, and many high ranking admirals, while documenting his meetings and correspondence. Several sources also credit him with taking an American or World Welterweight Wrestling Championship in December 1907. Hollandersky's claim to the championship was a result of a victory over \\"Young Roeber\\" who wrestled frequently in New York and held several wrestling weight division titles.Hollandersky correctly spells wrestler \\"Young Roeber\\" and claims he beat him in \\"Look Who's Here!, 'Tis Newsboy Abe\\", The Day, New London, Connecticut, pg. 14, 8 January 1909\\"Young Roeber Challenges\\", Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, p. 15, 12 December 1904Hollandersky beat Young Rober for Welterweight Wrestling Championship, in \\"Abe the Newsboy Has Good Record\\", Washington Herald, pg 4, Washington DC, 31 March 1912.In December 1907, Hollandersky won the Welterweight Wrestling Championship of the world by downing Young Rober in a record four hours and eighteen minutes, in Ft.

Like many Jewish families in their part of the world, the Hollanderskys struggled to survive in the grips of poverty with little opportunity to improve their fate. Abe held memories of his mother washing clothes barefoot in the snow of Berzniki. Though his book and the ship's manifest from his first entry into the United States give his birth year as 1888, Hollandersky cited December 3, 1887, as his birth date in his passport application, and other official documents. The ship's manifest for his arrival in the United States in 1899 likely gives the more accurate birth date of 1888, as it was provided by his mother on entry to the United States when Abe was 11. Abe's mother Celia, raised by a religious leader, created strong Old Testament values in Abe that were reflected in the moral tone of much of his autobiography. Celia's father, Mowza (Moses) Finkielsztejn, was a \\"Podskolnik\\", a part-time temple leader who could fill in as a Rabbi or teach Hebrew.As witness to the birth of Beyla Majampolski, Moses Finkielsztejn was a Podskolnik, age 50 at the time, approximately born in 1812, from Birth Record of Beyla Marjampolski, 1865, parents Falk Marjampolsky(Later Hollandersky) and Sarah Feyga Finkielsztejn from 1865 birth record stored in Sejny PolandFrom 1865 Marriage Record of Falk Marjampolsky(later Hollandersky), 23, and Sarah Feyga Finkielsztejn, 23, Record from Sejny, Poland Record (Akt 27) of Polish DawoodyFalk Marjampolsky (Hollandersky) marriage record also published in Suwalk Lomza Website Publications, Volume 20, No. 1-2, Sejny Marriage Supplements for 1862‚Äì1865Silverman, Marlene, \\"Hollanderskis in the Chesterfield, CT. Farming Community\\", Suwalk-Lomza Interest Group, Volume 23, Numbers 3‚Äì4, June, 2014, pgs. 1‚Äì11 Pogroms, famine, restrictions on career opportunities, the inability to own or purchase property, and highly limited access to public secondary education caused by Tsar Alexander III's May Laws of 1882, encouraged the family to leave Russia. According to Abe's autobiography, many of the residents of Berzniki were evicted from their homes by edict of the Russian government if they could not prove they were land owners. Flight from Russia, arrival in America According to genealogist Marlene Silverman, Falk Hollandersky, Abe's Uncle, emigrated to America at age forty-three, arriving in New York around 1886 accompanied by his wife Sarah Feyga whom he had married in a small ceremony in Berznicki in 1865. Falk farmed in the summer and in the winter worked in a largely hand made garment and tailoring shop in Chesterfield, Connecticut, specializing in pants. By 1892, in New London, he opened a tailoring and clothing shop with his son-in- law Simon Plattus that eventually included the sale of quality fur coats he often made himself. Four of Abe's siblings, two boys and two girls, died of malnutrition in Berzniki prior to Abe's departure. Departing Russia around the age of nine or ten, Hollandersky headed to Berlin, Germany and than Manchester, England with his mother Celia and older brother Sol. In Manchester, Celia worked in the textile industry to raise money for passage to America. Manchester was a natural choice as her cousin Solomon Hollandersky, Uncle Falk's son, had already emigrated there before coming to America.Hollandersky, Abe (1958). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, pg. 126. Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles. Hollandersky's father Charles, a tailor, had preceded him to America around 1886 to find work, at some point plying his trade with his brother Falk in New England. Charles sent money from New England to Abe's mother so his family could eventually afford passage to America, but became blind before they were able to leave Berzniki. Uncle Falk and his wife Sarah Feyga provided parental support to Abe at times in his youth. Falk Hollandersky's wife Sarah and Abe's mother Celia were sisters, daughters of assistant Rabbi Mowza (Moses) Finkielsztejn (born c. 1812). The two sisters in turn married the Hollandersky brothers Falk and Charles.Falk may have been in New London as early as 1892 in \\"Falk Hollandersky Passes Away At Age of 94 Years,\\" New London Day, pg. 5, New London, Connecticut, 15 October 1930As evidence that Sarah and Celia Hollandersky were sisters, as witness to the birth of Beyla Marjampolski, Moses Finkielsztejn was a Podskolnik, age 50 at the time, approximately born in 1812, from Birth Record of Beyla Marjampolski, 1865, lists parents, Falk Marjampolsky(Later Hollandersky) and Sarah Feyga Finkielsztejn from 1865 birth record of Beyla Marjampolski stored in Sejny Poland. Secondly, tombstone of Celia (Tsirl) Hollandersky's (In Hebrew) in Ohave Shalom Cemetery, Waterford, CT, states her father's name as Moshe (Moses). Abe's 1931 California Marriage record lists his mother's name as Sarah(Celia) Finkelstein, thus Moses Finkielsztejn was her father, Sarah Hollandersky's (Falk's Wife) English tombstone in Ohave Shalom Cemetery, Waterford, CT, gives her name as Sarah Finkel (Maiden Name), son of Moses or Maiden name Sarah Finkel. Her full maiden name Sarah Finkielsztejn is given in her Sejny, Poland Marriage record of 1865, and we know her father's name was Moses. Abe, his mother Celia, and brother Sol first arrived in America in 1899. Hollandersky arrived with little or no public schooling. He took boxing training at a local YMCA, and continued to sell newspapers as a youth, having begun by selling them in Manchester, England, around age eight or nine.Hollandersky, Abe (1958).

Youthful trespassing offense in New London By the age of seventeen, Hollandersky was wrestling professionally in New London, and at sixteen, in September 1904, was found guilty of trespassing on the New York, New Haven, and New London Railroad. The New London judge found Abe was the \\"ringleader of a gang of boys who made themselves a nuisance by hanging around the station,\\" and they may have hitched the occasional ride on the boxcars.\\"Abe the Newsboy Given Warning\\", The Day, pg. 6, New London, Connecticut, 3 September 1904 For a boy who chose boxing as a profession, this was a minor offense, but Hollandersky may have suffered from a lack of adult supervision having never attended public school, and having a blind father who was limited in the role he could take in his upbringing. The following month, according to The Day, Hollandersky headed Southwest to Louisville, Kentucky where he had family.\\"Newsboy Wrestler Hies to the South\\", The Day, pg. 2, New London, Connecticut, 24 October 1904  Encounter with President Roosevelt  USS Mayflower Roosevelt (right) and Admiral Robley Evans (left) aboard the USS Mayflower during fleet review, September 1906 Presidential Yacht USS Mayflower circa 1905 After he tried to sell a newspaper to Teddy Roosevelt aboard the presidential yacht USS Mayflower in September 1906, Roosevelt had Admiral Robley D. Evans, Commander of the North Atlantic Fleet, create the official unpaid title \\"Newsboy of the Navy,\\" for Hollandersky, giving him the right to sell papers to any Navy ship and travel to any destination on U. S. Naval vessels. According to Hollandersky's autobiography, their meeting took place during Roosevelt's Presidential review of the Naval fleet in New York's Oyster Bay, off Long Island, September 2‚Äì4, 1906, and was a pivotal point in Abe's career. Hollandersky had a busy boxing schedule in New York that year which kept him near Oyster Bay, and Roosevelt had likely come from his home off the Bay. Hollandersky and the President engaged in a brief and friendly exchange of light blows after Roosevelt waved off his Secret Service bodyguards. Their meeting took place on the Starboard deck of the Presidential yacht after Roosevelt saw Abe's cauliflower ear, and asked if he was a boxer. The President had boxed competitively at Harvard, and took a sincere interest in the eighteen year old newsboy who was keen on selling his papers to the fleet.Hoffman, Abe (Fall, 2007). Going a Few Rounds with Abe the Newsboy, Western States Jewish History, Volume 36, pgs 3‚Äì33. According to historian Abraham Hoffman, Charles J. Bonaparte, Secretary of the Navy, several Secret Service bodyguards, Edith Roosevelt, the President's wife, and the well known entrepreneur Cornelius Vanderbilt were also aboard the Mayflower during Roosevelt's September fleet review. A signed letter from Hollandersky's book authenticates a relationship between him and President Roosevelt. The letter extends an invitation from the President for Abe to visit him at the White House.

After meeting Roosevelt, Hollandersky boxed aboard the Presidential yacht Mayflower to entertain members of Congress, and later briefly met President Woodrow Wilson aboard the Mayflower off New London.Hollandersky, Abe (1958).

Naval contacts and work with the US Navy  During his early work with the Navy, Abe sold newspapers to ships off the New London harbor. While serving U. S. Naval Academy Midshipmen during their annual summer cruise from Annapolis in July and August in New London's Gardiner Bay, he met many future Admirals. Around 1906, Abe met Captain George Fried who would become famous in the late 1920s for the valiant rescues of the French ship Antinoe and the Italian freighter Florida while he commanded ocean liners of the United States Lines.Abe met George Fried as a young Quartermaster aboard the USS Hartford in Hollandersky, Abe (1958). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Preface, pg. 1. USS Chesapeake, later Admiral Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations, circa 1945 When they first met, Fried was a young fledgling sailor serving his first Naval assignment aboard the old civil war era schooner USS Hartford, where he learned the art of navigation.Fried served on the Hartford as a fledgling sailor around 1905 in Fried, George, \\"My Thirty Years at Sea\\", Ludington Daily News, pg. 5, Ludington, Michigan, 26 February 1929. Fried and Hollandersky maintained an acquaintance for many years. Admiral J. M. Reeves, a pioneer in the use of Naval air warfare, was one of the many high-ranking officers who claimed to have been sold newspapers by Hollandersky very early in his career, and throughout his very distinguished years of service.Picture of Reeves and letter stating Reeves had known Abe for 30 years in Hollandersky, Abe (1958). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Chapter 12, p. 235. Future Commodore Harry Asher Badt was one of the many Naval Academy midshipman who met Abe around 1905 in New London during the Academy's annual summer cruise from Annapolis. Badt was aboard the USS Chesapeake, a three-masted, wooden-hulled, fully rigged ship, renamed the USS Severn in 1905. Abe claimed to have again sold papers aboard the Severn while she was in port near Ancon, Panama around late 1913. Badt was part of the US Naval Academy's class of 1908, according to their yearbook the Lucky Bag, during the period when Lieutenant William D. Leahy was beginning his Naval career as a teaching assistant in Physics and Electrical Engineering.Harry Badt met Abe on the USS Severn according to a signed photo in Hollandersky, Abe (1953). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, pg. 108 Twenty-five years later, Admiral Leahy, while serving as Chief of Staff to Franklin Roosevelt, would write a brief review of Abe's book in March 1930 and on December 7, 1943, would sign his Award of Merit for recruiting 1700 men for the Navy in the ramp up for WWII. Leahy had formerly served as the Chief of Naval Operations from 1937‚Äì39. Also signing the award in 1943 were Fleet Admiral C.W. Nimitz, largely responsible for the Navy's success at the Battle of Midway in 1942, and James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy. Both would send photographs to Abe for his book, with Admiral Nimitz's photo depicting him posing with Abe before a map.Leahy, Nimitz, and Forrestal send signed photos to Abe in Hollandersky, Abe (1953).

Fighting a kangaroo and bear Abe boxed a huge muzzled bear named \\"Custer\\" around 1905 at Huber's Dime Museum on 14th Street in New York City. Harry Houdini would later perform at the same Huber's. With his friend, Irish heavyweight boxer and ex-Navy man Tom Sharkey acting as referee, Abe claimed to have knocked out the bear, who fell from the ring damaging a grand piano, infuriating the Museum's manager and amazing the large audience who included several Tammany Hall politicians. Sharkey had fought for the World Heavyweight Championship and was arguably the greatest boxer the Navy produced at the turn of the century.Description of fight with bear in Hollandersky, Abe (1958). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Chapter 12. Abe boxed or wrestled a kangaroo in an exhibition in Australia during his first world cruise with the Navy around 1907-8, but was thrown out of the ring by a swing of the animal's tail. These incidents were described with humor and detail in Abe's book as well as much later being the subject of noted sports writer Harold Rosenthal's December 1978 article on Abe in Sports Illustrated.Rosenthal, Harold, \\"Fighter-Writer Abe the Newsboy Beat a Bear But Lost to a Kangaroo\\", Sports Illustrated, 11 December 1978, Volume 49, issue 24, p.112. They added a certain color to the story of his life which appealed to the newspaper reporters that wrote about him in brief biographies. Much of his early boxing experience took place in and around New York City, as his family kept a residence there until at least 1909, while Abe's father maintained an apartment on 167 East Broadway. As a young New York club fighter in 1906, Abe fought the better known boxers Todo Moran, Patsy Connors, Harry Greenhouse and \\"Buffalo\\" Eddie Kelly. In the early Spring of 1906 in a smokey New York City boxing club known as the Lion's Palace, talented featherweight \\"Buffalo\\" Eddie Kelly took only ten seconds to knock an inexperienced eighteen year old Abe to the canvas for a full count. Two years later, Kelly would challenge the legendary Jewish boxer Abe Attell three times for the Featherweight Championship of the World.Buffalo Eddie fought Abe in \\"Murphey Winner Over Bert Keyes\\", Evening World, pg. 10, New York, New York, 26 March 1906. Bout with Maurice Lemoine, December 1908 On December 14, 1908, not long after his participation in the Cruise of the Great White Fleet at only twenty, Hollandersky fought a close six-round match with Maurice Lemoine at the Grand Opera House in New Haven, Connecticut. Though New London's The Day gave the decision to Lemoine, the prestigious New York Times felt Hollandersky had the better of the bout,\\"winning on points\\", and \\"battering Lemoine in the sixth and last round\\".Hollandersky won on points and battered Lemoine in the final round in \\"Lewis Boys Draw\\", The New York Times, New York, New York, pg. 7, 15 December 1908 The widely covered fight was a preliminary to a World Welterweight Title match between reigning Jewish World Welterweight Champion Harry Lewis, and his frequent opponent Willie Lewis. In September 1910, two years after his close bout with Lemoine, Abe, with excessive self-confidence, challenged former World Welterweight Champion Honey Mellody to a bout by posting a challenge in The New London Day. Mellody's handler's declined to respond. Two weeks prior to the challenge, Mellody had knocked out Abe's December 1908 opponent Lemoine, and drew against him four months later in a bout in Webster, Massachusetts. Hollandersky used Mellody's matching with Lemoine, a boxer he may have beaten, as an indication he had the skills to face the ex-World Welterweight Champion.Hollandersky challenged Mellody to a bout in \\"Abe Issues Defi to Knockers' Club\\", \\"New London Day\\", New London, Connecticut, pg. 10, 13 September 1910Lemoine fought Mellody in New England opponents Austin Rice in his prime in 1902 Hollandersky's best known opponents in New England included Austin Rice, Dave Palitz, Al Rogers, Italian Joe Gans, and Tommy Teague. Teague was a Navy Welterweight Champion from the USS Michigan when they fought in June 1911, and later an unsuccessful opponent of New York Jewish boxer Al McCoy four days before McCoy became the youngest boxer at seventeen to win the World Middleweight Championship. McCoy and Hollandersky would later both appear in 20th Century Picture's 1933 The Bowery. Fellow welterweight boxer Al Rogers had decisively beaten ex-World Welterweight Champion Honey Mellody on June 10, 1912, in Baltimore just two weeks before beating Abe in an important fifteen round bout in the same city's Empire Theatre.\\"Abe Fights Navy Champion\\", Norwich Bulletin, pg. 3, New London, CT., 6 June 1911. Hollandersky fought fellow New Londoner Austin Rice and Connecticut welterweight Dave Palitz on more than five occasions each. Rice had shown enormous boxing promise at age thirty as a contender for the Featherweight Championship of the World against Young Corbett II on January 14, 1903. Hollandersky fought Rice, who was twelve years older and sidelined as a carpenter, in both paid and exhibition bouts until the end of Rice's boxing career. Fellow New Londoner Mosey King, an early New England Lightweight Champion and Yale boxing coach for forty years, is included in Hollandersky's list of fights in the back of his autobiography as a \\"Win\\". King, who like Abe was of Jewish ancestry and raised in a close family, was Connecticut's first boxing commissioner from 1921‚Äì23, and reputed to have given tips to any boxer looking to improve his game. He was a likely opponent of Hollandersky at least in a sparring or exhibition match, as he grew up in New London with Abe. According to at least one source, Rice, King, and Hollandersky shared Jimmy Nelson as an early coach and sparring partner as youths in New London. The legend goes that Nelson had worked as a corner man for undefeated World Lightweight Champion Jack McAuliffe before coming to New London.Donahue, Thomas E., \\"Ins and Outs of Sport's World\\", The Day, pg. 23, New London, CT., 17 September 1935.\\"Sporting Notes, Boxing Gossip\\", Our Paper, Massachusetts Reformatory, Concord, Massachusetts, Volume 38, p.561, 19 November 1921 Work with the Navy Raising War bonds with Abe in center wearing tie, actor Jimmy Durante on left with fedora Hollandersky's long career with the Navy included work as an independent supply boat operator or \\"bum boater\\" from which he sold magazines and newspapers to the fleet. His boat was a small motorized dingy that was rumored to have been given to him by Admiral Robley Evans. Early in his career, Abe saved several people from drowning and rescued stranded boats in Gardiner Bay off the docks of New London while \\"bum boating\\" for the Navy. \\"Bum boating\\" consisted of taking a small launch out to naval vessels and selling newspapers, magazines, and small supplies to Navy personnel. In his small launch, he also performed tasks such as delivering mail to naval ships.Descriptions of water rescues taken from newspapers appear in Hollandersky, Abe (1958). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Water rescues appear in early Chapter 21 and Earthquake Relief work in Chapter 23, pg. 414. In his mid-career with the Navy, he worked as a boxing instructor for sailors at the pier in New London near the end of WWI, and as a recruiter of 1,700 naval personnel in WWII while he was living in Los Angeles. He also gave boxing exhibitions and training, and sold newspapers to Naval ships during his world cruises. After cruising to California in 1925, Abe helped the Navy provide relief for the aftermath of the Santa Barbara earthquake that struck on June 25, 1925. He raised War Bonds in WWII, occasionally capitalizing on his contacts with former boxers, and entertainers, such as Jimmy Durante, with whom he had worked in a movie. He later assisted the Navy in providing relief following the March 10, 1933 Los Angeles area earthquake that had an epicenter near Long Beach, California, where he had his news stand. He was caught in the earthquake on the day it struck, and narrowly escaped injury.Hollandersky's appearance in \\"Road House Nights\\" appears in third edition of his biography and a list of the cast of \\"Road House Nights\\" in By 1947, the Navy bestowed on Abe the \\"Award of Merit\\" for his recruiting of both men and women for WWII.\\"Abe the Newsboy Here After Eighteen Year Lapse\\", Newport Mercury, Newport, Rhode Island, pg. 8, 12 September 1947 Four cruises with the fleet Hollandersky took four long voyages that included cruises on Naval vessels prior to his marriage. Abe took a cruise sometime between 1906‚Äì8 that followed part of the Cruise of the Great White Fleet to Australia, and possibly Japan and China, and a second long boxing cruise beginning in 1912 from New London to Jamaica, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Chile that returned to New London. His third trip was a voyage that included primarily land travel from New London, Connecticut to San Pedro, California in 1921, and his fourth cruise around 1924 went via sea from New London to Cuba than overland to the West Coast, before following the Trans- Pacific \\"Good Will Cruise\\" from San Francisco to Honolulu in June 1925. During his cruises, Abe often boxed and wrestled matches for both the training and entertainment of the troops and fought a few land-based professional bouts as well. His primary function was acting as a newsboy to the crew, making stops to pick up English newspapers at most major ports. Cruise with Great White Fleet, 1907‚Äì1908 , with white hull on Cruise of Great White Fleet, 1908 Hollandersky's voyage to Australia occurred not long after he met Theodore Roosevelt, early in his boxing career, around 1906‚Äì08 as part of the Cruise of the Great White Fleet. The second half of the fourteen-month cruise, much of which included Abe, routed sixteen state-of-the-art coal burning American battleships with white painted hulls from the California coast to New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, and China. USS Connecticut leading the Great White Fleet, 1907 Japan was already threatening as a naval power and President Roosevelt, architect of the cruise, intended to demonstrate the strength of the American fleet to both allied countries and potential enemies. Hollandersky sailed aboard the USS Kearsarge and served as her newsboy as she circumnavigated the globe and docked at the Navy's most exotic ports. The pinnacle of naval technology at the time, the Kearsarge served as the flagship of the North Atlantic fleet through 1905. Both heavily armed and armored, she carried a crew of 550, and could cruise at a top speed of twenty miles per hour. She docked in Australia in August 1908, along with close to a thousand sailors from the fifteen other Naval vessels who flooded the streets and received a warm reception in Melbourne and Sydney. Abe would have had time to take primarily the Australian leg of the cruise. He likely stopped at Aukland, New Zealand, and possibly the Philippines as he was absent from New London through much of 1906, six months in 1907 and nine months in 1908 which included the period when the Kearsarge arrived in Melbourne in August. His rigorous boxing and wrestling schedule precluded him from traveling continuously for the full fourteen months of the cruise.Photo of newer Kearsarge crew at bottom of page with caption, \\"I used to be the newsboy on the old Kearsarge with the white fleet\\" in Hollandersky, Abe, The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, California, after Chapter 23, pg. 435 Chief Harry Simmon Morris, who served as an Ordinary Seaman and bugler on the during the cruise with Abe, became one of Abe's lifelong friends. A Torpedo's Mate for most of his career, Morris would become the longest-serving enlisted man in U. S. Naval history at 55 years, serving from 1903‚Äì58.Morris was on the cruise of the Great White Fleet aboard the USS Kearsarge, full naval service record in Hollandersky, Abe (1958).

He may have broken his record for newspaper sales when he and a group of newsies contracted to him sold thousands of papers to the returning sailors, off Hampton Roads, near Norfolk, Virginia. The Hampton Roads ceremony for the returning fleet included a speech by President Theodore Roosevelt aboard the USS Connecticut, flagship of the cruise, during the third week of February, 1909. According to his book, Hollandersky personally sold a paper to both the President and Admiral Evans on their return from the cruise.Hollandersky, Abe (1958).

He used his naval privileges in combination with commercial vessels between 1912 and 1914, to sail south from his hometown of New London, selling newspapers to the fleet while stopping to fight boxing matches in Cuba, Jamaica, Panama, Chile, and later Mexico. He arrived in New York from Chile, ending his South American travels in early December 1914, before returning to New London.Arrived in New York on December 1 in \\"Abe the Newsboy, Home Once More\\", Hartford Courant, pg. 20, 17 December 1914 In January and February 1912, taking a commercial vessel South, he fought several bouts and wrestled at or near the base in Guantanamo, Cuba, while the fleet was on maneuvers. He served briefly as newsboy for the while she was in Cuba in January.Abe aboard USS Delaware in \\"Abe the Newsboy Wants Labor Day Bout\\", Norwich Bulletin, Norwich, Connecticut, pg. 3, 14 August 1912 The New York Tribune of March, 1912, reported \\"Abe has been with the fleet at Guantanamo all winter and has won several bouts with ease against the best the island affords.\\" The Reverend W. H. \\"Ironsides\\" Reaney was a boxing mentor to Abe while he was in Cuba, and helped arrange his Cuban bouts during morning breakfasts aboard the ill-fated battleship USS Utah. Reaney helped referee a few shipboard fights, and had boxed in his earlier days. The USS Utah had been constructed the previous August, 1911, and was on a shakedown cruise ending in Guantanamo. Though obsolete by 1941, she would become one of the first ships lost at Pearl Harbor. Abe credited Reaney with helping him to find matches in Jamaica and for encouraging him to seek his fortune in Panama City. In the early spring of 1912, Abe returned to the states via steamship from Cuba, resumed his boxing and wrestling career, and rescued a woman from a subway mishap in New London that August.Reaney was a boxing mentor in \\"Abe the Newsboy Loses Fine Friend\\", The Day, New London, Connecticut, p. 12, 20 November 1915Subway rescue in Norwich in The Day, New London, Connecticut, 23 August 1912Abe left for Cuba around January 7, 1912, in \\"Abe the Newsboy Sails with the Fleet; Boxer and Grappler to Sell Muckrakers to Sailors\\", Hartford Courant, Hartford, Connecticut, 6 January 1912Abe definitely fought in Cuba in \\"Abe 'the Newsboy' Here,\\" New York- Tribune, New York, New York, pg. 8, 21 March 1912. Heading South the following spring of 1913, Abe defeated talented black boxers T. K. Wint, billed as Young Jack Johnson, \\"Welterweight Champion of the West Indies,\\" and Young Joe Jeanette in ten round bouts in Kingston, Jamaica. He then headed directly to Panama to face the Panamanian heavyweight champion Jack Ortega. Panamanian Heavy Title, 1913 Jack Ortega, circa 1900 His historic first bout for the Panamanian Heavyweight Title with Californian Jack Ortega in Panama City on May 30, 1913, featured an audience of nearly two thousand and included most of the members of an American congressional party in Panama, there to view the final stages of the building of the Panama Canal. According to Abe, the congressmen had sailed there on the Presidential yacht Mayflower. Ortega, the reigning Panamanian heavyweight champion, was known to deliver knockout punches and his size made him a formidable opponent. Abe entered the ring to an ovation and a hearty round of applause, as Ortega was not a friend of the Panamanian crowd who knew him from previous fights. The match ended in an eighth round foul when, by most accounts, Abe was having the better of the bout, landing more frequent and strategic blows, if less powerful than his opponent's. Hollandersky was around twenty-five and in the prime of his boxing career, while Ortega was around thirty-six, and outweighed Hollandersky by at least thirty-five or forty pounds. He had power, and strength, but lacked the speed of his younger opponent.Description of the first Ortega fight in Hollandersky, Abe (1933). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Chapter 6, pages vary by edition. President Barahona, 1912 According to one newspaper, after Ortega pushed him onto the ropes in the final round, \\"Abe was partly in the ring and partly out of it, spectators in the crowd trying to prevent his falling from the platform and Ortega, without really realizing what he was doing but fighting madly, swung low and landed on Abe's groin\\". The article continues, \\"Abe, who did not fall when the blow was delivered, walked to his corner across the ring and then laid down on the floor to recover from the effects of the punch. The injury he received was apparent to all who were close to see him when he was undressed by his seconds. It was some fifteen minutes before he was able to leave the ring.\\" Hollandersky inferred in his autobiography the foul was probably intentional, particularly the one that ended his rematch with Ortega later in August. The foul ended the bout, and made Hollandersky Heavyweight Champion of Panama. Taking home the princely sum of $900 for the bout, Hollandersky claimed to have used $600 of his winnings for a down payment on a home for his blind father Charles in New London, likely at 251 Huntington Avenue.Hollandersky, Abe (1958).

Abe spoke to the group of dignitaries, gamblers, and fellow boxers about his victory.Abe met President Porras of Panama in Hollandersky, Abe (1933). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Chapter 7, pg. 133Ortega was born around 1876 and was around 37 at the time of his fight with Abe in \\"Jack Ortega Sentenced to Imprisonment for Life\\", San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, pg 7, Saturday, 1 December 1900. =Panamanian heavyweight rematch, August 1913= Rematch with Ortega on center right, August 11, 1913 Hollandersky successfully defended his Panamanian Heavyweight Title only once, in an 18 of 45 round rematch with Jack Ortega on Sunday, August 10, 1913, in the National Sports Arena in Panama City. After a morning rain, the lengthy match took place outdoors beneath the tropical sun, beginning around four in the afternoon. Hollandersky had trained for a full month, making a training camp on the neighboring Pacific island of Taboga, while Ortega had trained more diligently than he had for his first bout. The initial rounds of the match went slowly and uneventfully, followed by several rounds where Ortega clinched frequently using his weight advantage to wear down his opponent. In the later rounds, Hollandersky landed frequent blows to the chest, probably lacking the reach to connect often with the head or chin and wary of exposing himself to an opponent with greater reach and power. Hollandersky did on occasion connect with a stiff left jab to the head of Ortega. Throughout the match, Ortega used backhanded blows from his glove to Hollandersky's face and jaw. With Ortega in pain, exhausted, struggling, and suffering from a blow to the chin, he struck Abe below the belt in round 18. According to Hollandersky's autobiography, Ortega, \\"backed away, leered at me, and then deliberately raised his leg and kicked me in the belly\\". One account indicates the blow was from a raised knee.The final blow was a knee to the belly in \\"Abe the Newsboy Again Whips Ortega\\", Hartford Courant, Hartford, Connecticut, pg. 16, 21 August 1913 After calling a foul for the low blow, the referee ended the bout, and Hollandersky retained the Panamanian Heavyweight Title.Hollandersky, Abe (1953).

Ortega would be arrested in Panama City only one week later for fixing a fight by taking a first round dive against the Pittsburgh boxer Buck Crouse. Hollandersky claimed in his book to have been present at the fight. In November 1900, Ortega had been convicted of assaulting an eleven-year-old girl in San Jose, California and was sentenced to life in San Quentin. He served only around twelve years before traveling to Panama. Prior to his arrest in 1900, he had once brutally kicked an opponent in the ring during a prize-fight in 1899, and in a separate incident been arrested for battery. Hollandersky claimed in his autobiography that Ortega had sent envoys to try to bribe him to lose their second bout, and that he had once attempted armed assault against him in a Panamanian bar.\\"Boxer Abe the Newsboy here\\", The New York Times, pg. 10, New York, New York., 3 September 1913.Description of Ortega serving thirteen years in San Quentin in \\"Killing the Goose in the Canal Zone,\\" The Winnipeg Tribune, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, p. 19, 23 August 1913Ortega convicted of assaulting an eleven year old girl in \\"Jack Ortega Found Guilty\\", San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco, California, pg. 4, 2 November 1900Ortega was sentenced to life for assault, and his age is mentioned in \\"Jack Ortega Sentenced to Imprisonment for Life\\", San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, pg 7, Saturday, 1 December 1900.Ortega's charge of battery in \\"Two Young Bloods\\", Santa Cruz Sentinel, Santa Cruz, California, pg. 3, 4 May 1899Ortega kicked Nick Burley in the ribs during a boxing match in San Jose in \\"Pistols and Knives in a Roped Arena, The San Francisco Call, pg. 3, 29 March 1899 Panamanian Title loss, 1914 William Ward, known as Kid Norfolk Loss of Panamanian heavyweight title to Norfolk, January 18, 1914 Five months after taking the championship from Ortega, Hollandersky lost his Panamanian heavyweight title, but lasted for twenty-five grueling rounds against the young and gifted, 1921 American \\"Colored\\" World Light Heavyweight Champion, William Ward, known as Kid Norfolk. Few in the crowd believed that Hollandersky would last ten rounds with the future Boxing Hall of Fame champion, who had a four-inch height advantage and outweighed him by over twenty-five pounds. Abe's ability to go the limit with Norfolk, seemed more impressive when considering, \\"from eleven until two o'clock on the day of the battle, Hollandersky was at Colon Harbor selling newspapers to the Marines on the USS Minnesota, only two hours before stepping into the ring with Kid Norfolk at four that afternoon\\".Hollandersky, Abe (1937). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Description of the Norfolk fight is at beginning of Chapter 22, and includes a description of his earnings for the fight in picture caption. The match took place at a Skating Rink in Ancon, Panama, on Sunday afternoon, January 18, 1914, before a sold-out crowd. New London's The Day wrote that Hollandersky had the edge in only three of the rounds, before the end when Norfolk \\"began battering Abe around the ring and trying hard for a knockout\\". The Panamanian crowd voiced their approval of the Newsboy's tenacity, and as soon as the final bell sounded to end the long contest, they \\"stormed the ring and carried the little fellow (Abe) off on their shoulders.\\" Hollandersky claimed he was paid ten dollars a round for the Norfolk bout, and an additional seventeen hundred dollars that he shared from the winnings of his sailor friends, many of whom had bet on him to last ten rounds. This brought the total earnings for his evening's work to $1,950, roughly two years salary for many Americans in that era.\\"Abe the Newsboy loses Fight\\", Norwich Bulletin, pg. 3, Norwich, CT., 2 February 1914.\\"Kid Norfolk Hands Abe Fine Trimming\\", The Day, pg. 10, 31 January 1914.Hollandersky, Abe (1953).

Boxing in Panama after title The better known opponents Hollandersky fought in Panama after his loss of the title in 1914 included Jerry Cole, \\"Steamboat\\" Bill Scott, Tommy Connors, Eddie Ryan and later in 1916, Panama Joe Gans. Panama Joe had such legendary speed and skill that he would act as a sparring partner to prepare Jack Dempsey for his September 1920 Heavyweight Title bout with Hall of Famer Billy Miske as well as Dempsey's earlier bout when he first took the Heavyweight Championship from Jess Willard in Toledo.Panama Joe trained Dempsey for Billy Miske in The 5' 4\\" welterweight Hollandersky lost to Panama Joe, the younger and stronger Panamanian Light and Middleweight champion, and the accomplished middleweight Connors of Scranton, Pennsylvania, who had a five-inch height advantage. But he gave a closer fight to the Seattle welterweight Ryan before an impressive crowd of 1500 at the Savannah Club in Ancon, Panama on February 23, 1914. The Panamanian fans voiced their disapproval of the referee's Draw ruling as Hollandersky appeared to have landed more blows.\\"Abe the Newsboy Draws with Ryan\\", pg. 9, The New York Times, New York, New York, 24 February 1914 The Norwich Bulletin felt Hollandersky had the edge in the Ryan bout which they referred to as a \\"Welterweight Championship of the Isthmus.\\" Perhaps as a result, Abe's fight records at the end of his autobiography and Nat Fleischer's 1944 Ring Record Book referred to Hollandersky as a Welterweight Champion of Panama, though his actual title was heavyweight champion.\\"Abe the Newsboy in 20 Round Bout\\", Norwich Bulletin, pg. 3, Norwich, CT., 11 March 1914. Boxing and wrestling, 1914‚Äì18 After his loss to Jerry Cole in May 1914, Hollandersky sailed South from Panama to Ecuador and Peru, and spent the Fourth of July 1914, on a snow- covered peak in the Andes.He spent fourth of July in the Andes in \\"Abe the Newsboy Comes Back Home\\", The Day, New London, Connecticut, p. 10, 14 December 1914 In August and September 1914, he fought Chilean Valeriano Dinamarca and black middleweight William Daly several times near the coast in Valparaiso, Chile receiving a badly broken nose from a blow by Daly. Their brutal September bout, scheduled for six rounds, ended in a third-round disqualification when Abe accidentally head-butted Daly. On a substantial bet, heading inland to Santiago, Chile, Abe fought a jiu-jitsu wrestling match with a Count Sako, part of a Japanese wrestling troop. Abe claimed he had a cursory knowledge of certain martial arts including jiu-jitsu. He won the match, which included three sets, the first Jiu Jitsu, the second catch-as-catch-can or mixed and the third American style Greco-Roman. He lost only the first Jiu Jitsu set to his Japanese opponent who was clearly more skilled in the Japanese martial art. Abe then returned to the states by sea. In February 1915, giving up five inches in reach, Abe lost a twenty-round bout to 5' 9\\" El Paso welterweight Frankie Fowser in Agua Prietta, Mexico, a border town near Douglas, Arizona. He made a brief appearance in El Paso then spent early March through early June 1915 in Fort Worth, Texas, arranging wrestling bouts, including two with Jimmy Pappas in April, winning one. He refereed a free boxing and wrestling exhibition on March 27, wrestled an exhibition with Joe Gens, a Russian Jewish immigrant, and shadow boxed at a benefit for the Jewish Community of Fort Worth's YMHA, that drew over three hundred guests.\\"Abe the Newsboy\\", Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, (19, 23 March 1915, pg 10,) (17 May 1915, pg. 2), 21 July 1915.Abe fought Fowser in \\"Frankie Fowser\\", The International Horseshoer's Monthly Volume XVII, January 1916, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 20 Losses to Dave Palitz, 1915‚Äì16 Perhaps the single fight that most influenced the \\"Newsboy\\" to retire was his brutal loss to welterweight Dave \\"KO\\" Palitz on September 6, 1915, in Lawrence Hall in New London. An accomplished welterweight, Palitz would unsuccessfully challenge Lou Holtz for the Connecticut State Welterweight Championship in 1920. During a boxing and wrestling tour in the Southwest and Mexico in the first half of 1915, Hollandersky had suffered from an illness of several weeks which may have contributed to his lack of conditioning for the bout.Abe had been sick in his 1915 boxing tour to the Southwest in \\"Abe, the Newsboy, Back from an Extended Tour\\", The Day, New London, Connecticut, p. 3, 24 June 1915 The Springfield Courier said of the twenty round battle that \\"K. O. Palitz of this city handed Abe the worst trimming a man ever received in a local ring, though the newsboy was on his feet at the end of the bout\\". New London's The Day, noticing Abe's puffy face, swollen ears, and blackened eye after the fight, wrote \\"he looked as if his demise were near at hand.\\"\\"Abe the Newsboy\\", Springfield Courier, pg. 1, Springfield, Connecticut, 7 September 1915.\\"Palitz Inflicted an Awful Beating\\", The Day, pg. 12, New London, Connecticut, 7 September 1915 The following February, Palitz defeated Abe again in a less brutal ten-round match which Hollandersky had staged and promoted. The day of boxing featured boxers Joe Azevedo, an exceptional lightweight, Young Terry, and Charley Curley.Hollandersky staged the match in \\"Joe Azevedo to Fight Here in Abe the Newsboy's Show\\", The Day, New London, Connecticut, pg. 12, 26 January 1916 Though Hollandersky continued to find matches, and even returned to Panama for several lucrative bouts in 1916, he may have sensed his days as a competitive prize fighter fighting top talent were numbered. Promoting Battling Levinsky Battling Levinsky, 1916‚Äì20 World Light Heavyweight Champion On March 9, 1916, Hollandersky promoted a fight between Hall of Fame Philadelphian Jewish boxer Battling Levinsky, and Sailor Jack Carroll sponsored by the Greenwood Athletic Club, fought in Lawrence Hall in New London. Levinsky, who won the ten round bout, would take the World Light Heavyweight Championship only seven months later, and hold it for four years. Like Abe, the far more accomplished Levinsky, born Beryl Lebrowitz, was a prolific New York based Jewish boxer, who may have fought as many as five hundred bouts. During his career, Levinsky fought many of boxing's greatest including Jack Dempsey, Gene Tunney, Billy Miske, and French boxer George Carpentier.\\"Slanting at Sportsland,\\" The Day, pg. 12, New London, Connecticut, 29 February 1916.Levinsky fought an estimated five hundred fights in The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame, Blady, Ken, (1988) Shapolsky Publishers, Inc., New York, NY, pgs. 90 Exhibitions with Abe Attell, 1916 Abe Attell, Featherweight Champion Later in New London in May 1916, Abe faced off against his best known exhibition opponent, Abe Attell, the brilliant but flawed former World Featherweight Champion, suspected of betting on several of his own fights and later accused of helping to fix the 1919 White Sox vs. Reds World Series with gangster Arnold Rothstein. Known as the Black Sox Scandal, the event brought to the forefront the corruption of American sports as it approached the roaring 20s. Abe met Attell in four three round exhibition matches at Empire Theatre while Attell was giving speaking performances in New London near the end of his boxing career.\\"The Two Abes Put on Lively Sparring Match,\\" The Day, pg. 12, New London, CT., 3 May 1916. Abe claimed to have fought what was likely a sparring match with Canadian Heavyweight champion Arthur Pelkey, who was a Panamanian national heavyweight title contender in February 1917 at Panama's Santa Anna Plaza against Kid Norfolk, during the same period Abe was fighting bouts at the Plaza with Panama Joe Gans and Willie Barnes.Abe said he fought Arthur Pelkey in \\"Abe the Newsboy Has Many Claims to Fame\\", The San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco, California, pg. 15, 8 May 1922 Panamanian Welter championship In his last prize fight in Panama City in June 1917, Hollandersky lost to Pat Kiley in an unsuccessful 15 round attempt at the Panamanian Welterweight Title. It would be his last recognized championship bout. Leaving Panama in July, he would stop in New York to help accompany his father Charles, who was ill, to New London.\\"After Eighteen Months Spent Far Away, New London Looked Very Attractive\\", The Day, pg. 3, New London, CT., 14 December 1914. Perhaps as a result of his loss to Kiley in his last championship bout, and his previous brutal loss to Dave Palitz in September 1915, Abe prematurely announced his retirement from boxing to his local paper on Christmas Eve 1917.\\"Abe the Newsboy Has Quit Boxing\\", The Day, pg. 10, New London, Connecticut, 24 December 1917. He continued with exhibition matches, including those on ship and on bases to assist with the training of sailors, but subsequently faced very few opponents in actual prize fights. Returning to New London in August 1917 from Panama City after his loss to Kiley, Abe was not permitted to join the Navy for WWI due to his eyesight, but was fortunate enough to find a position as a Naval boxing instructor at a base near the New London Pier. Fighting training matches for the instruction of naval troops often daily, his personal tally of fights continued to climb rapidly.\\"Abe, the Newsboy, is Not for Navy\\", The Day, pg. 2, New London, Connecticut, 4 August 1917 Welterweight Champ Joe Walcott Exhibition with champion Joe Walcott Gene Tunney, Hollandersky, and Larry Williams Facing another well known opponent in an exhibition match on November 16, 1918, Hollandersky met the former light and welterweight world champion Joe Walcott in New London for a four-round match to benefit the United War Workers of America. The bout showcased intense boxing strategy, though Walcott was well past his prime. Appearing as the headliner for the benefit was Larry Williams, a light heavyweight of considerable skill, who would act as a sparring partner for Jack Dempsey in 1921 and later for Dempsey's successor as world heavyweight champion, Gene Tunney.Hollandersky fought Joe Walcott in \\"Fast Bouts Staged at New London\\", Norwich Bulletin, pg. 3, Norwich, CT, 18 November 1918. Williams would appear with Abe in MGM's The Crowd Roars (1938). A photograph of Hollandersky with Williams and Gene Tunney, likely taken at a boxing benefit or training match, appear in most editions of Abe's book.Larry Williams sparred with Gene Tunney according to the article \\"Wildly Heralded Attractions are Billed at Weller and Liberty Today,\\", The Times-Recorder, Zanesville, Ohio, p. 13, 11 September 1938 Third cruise 1919-22, to California USS Camden, January 1921 Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. Abe took his second cruise between 1920‚Äì22. Though he definitely traveled from New London to the Naval base in San Pedro and returned to New London via a land route, little is known at this time of any additional Naval travels, as even in peacetime he was reluctant to record the movement of Navy ships in his biography. In San Pedro, he spent time delivering papers, giving boxing training, and performing odd jobs aboard the USS Camden (AS-6), a four hundred foot, highly armed, slow-moving submarine tender with a crew of around 300, confiscated from the German Navy in WWI. She sailed from her home port at New London's submarine base to San Pedro, where she arrived on June 24, 1921. The San Francisco Examiner noted that Abe took a world cruise during this period, but recorded no ports of call, though England, France, and western Europe seem likely stops as his book notes he went there, and previous cruises omitted these destinations.\\"he has travelled around the world several times on the Submarine tender Camden\\" in \\"Abe the Newsboy Has Many Claims to Fame\\", The San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco, California, pg. 15, 8 May 1922Abe was on USS Camden in 1922 in Our Navy, publication of the US Navy, pps. 26 (October 1921), p. 237 (May 1922), Volume 15, published by US Navy, Men-O'-Warsmen, Inc., Floral Park, New York, October 1921 and April 1922 Prior to his cruise, he wrote to and met briefly with Theodore Roosevelt Jr., Assistant Secretary of the Navy, to gain rights of passage to the coast. In a letter of May 1921, the Secretary thanked Hollandersky for his visit and mentioned he was aware of Abe's plans to visit the West Coast.Letter from Theodore Roosevelt Jr. dated May 13, 1921, notes Roosevelt was aware of his plans to visit the West Coast, in Hollandersky, Abe (1937). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Chapter 19, pg. 355 Hollandersky boxed sailor Billy Capelle in San Pedro, California, in February 1922. Capelle, better known as Willie Cappelli or Cappelle, was an accomplished welterweight from San Pedro at the end of his boxing career. Lieutenant John \\"Jack\\" F. Kennedy, a gunnery officer on the USS Mississippi, was a good friend who acted as a referee for several of Abe's shipboard bouts and may have refereed his bout with Capelle. Both Abe and Kennedy had worked extensively with Navy boxing teams. Kennedy, whose photograph appeared with Abe in most of his books, testified for the defense at Jack Dempsey's 1920 draft evasion trial in California and was considered as the referee for the World Heavyweight Championship between Jack Dempsey, and Jess Willard in Toledo, Ohio.Kennedy mentioned as Dempsey referee in Our Navy, publication of the US Navy, p. 32, Volume 15, published by US Navy, Men-O'-Warsmen, Inc., Floral Park, New York, July 1921Kennedy at Dempsey trial in Kahn, Roger, A Flame of Pure Fire, Harcourt, Inc., Copyright Hook Slide Inc., (1999), New York, New York, p. 164-5Hollandersky fought the sailor Billy Capelle in February of 1922 at Peck's Pavilion in San Pedro , Our Navy, publication of the US Navy, pps. 26 (October 1921), p. 237 (May 1922), Volume 15, published by US Navy, Men-O'-Warsmen, Inc., Floral Park, New York, October 1921 and April 1922 After arriving in San Pedro from New London, Abe went to San Francisco in July 1922, stopped to look for wrestling bouts, and then headed overland to El Paso, Texas, to meet friends on August 18, before returning to Connecticut. At the intermission of a fight fought by his frequent opponent Dave Palitz in Mystic, Connecticut, on August 30, 1922, Abe announced to the audience he had just returned from a world cruise.Hollandersky was back in San Francisco in July 1922, according to \\"Eastern Wrestler Would Meet Miller\\", San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco, CA, p. 2, 23 July 1922\\"Veteran Seeks L.A.

The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Hollandersky provides the date of one of his cruises as 1921 on the fourth page of Chapter 14Hollandersky announced having completed his world cruise on August 31, 1922, \\"Dave Palitz Wins From Russell in Twelve Round Bout in Mystic,\\" Norwich Bulletin, Norwich, Connecticut, p.3, 31 August 1922Hollandersky stopped in El Paso on his way back from California and his 1922 world cruise in \\"Abe the Newsboy Has Had 907 Bouts\\", El Paso Herald, El Paso, Texas, pg. 11, 19 August 1922 \\"Good Will\\" cruise, to Hawaii, 1925 As was often his habit before long cruises, Hollandersky first visited the White House. Before his cruise to Hawaii, he met President Calvin Coolidge and the White House staff in late October 1924. While there, Coolidge likely discussed ship movements and Abe's rights to sell papers to the Trans-Pacific fleet that would begin their voyage the following summer. Hoover also provided an autographed photo which appeared in all of Abe's books.\\"Visits Coolidge\\", Lincoln Evening Journal, Lincoln, Nebraska, pg. 1, 30 October 1924 In January 1925, he sailed from New England to Cuba to sell papers to the fleet and visit the Roosevelt Memorial in Santiago. He received a reference letter that February to assist him in his journey from Commander H. G. Gearing of the , near Guantanamo, and then made his way to the West Coast overland by that spring making a stop in El Paso on his way to California. Much of his travel to San Francisco that Spring was by train.Hollandersky travelled to San Francisco in March 1925 by train in, The San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco, California, pg. 4, 6 April 1925. Admiral Robert E. Coontz, Commander of the 1925 Good Will Cruise It was his plan that summer of 1925 to sell hundreds of papers to many of the 57 vessels of the combined Atlantic and Pacific fleets departing from ports in San Francisco, and San Pedro and heading for Hawaii, and Australia as part of a Trans-Pacific \\"Good Will\\" cruise. He departed San Francisco for Hawaii on April 15, 1925 aboard the commercial vessel Matsonia ahead of nearly all the fleet, but did not accompany the ships of the cruise to Australia as he had been there around 1908.Further verification that Hollandersky departed from San Francisco in, The San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco, California, pg. 4, 6 April 1925. The cruise was the largest assembly of American Naval vessels bound for a world tour since the cruise of the Great White Fleet seventeen years earlier. Abe received permission to sell papers to the ships of the 1925 Trans-Pacific Cruise from Admiral Robert Coontz, Commander of the cruise's flagship USS Washington.Hollandersky, Abe (1953). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, pg. 209. Hollandersky arrived in Honolulu, Hawaii, on April 21, 1925, six days after departing.\\"175 Arrive Aboard Liner Matsonia\\", Honolulu Star- Bulletin, Honolulu, Hawaii, pg. 31, 21 April 1925 That summer, he fought his last professional fight in Honolulu attended by territorial Governor Wallace Farrington and cruise commander Admiral Robert Coontz. The bout was most likely fought on June 5, 1925 at the Pearl Harbor Arena, as part of a series of matches attended by five thousand sailors and marines, many of whom were part of the Good Will Cruise. The primary boxing participants were a team from the Cruise's Scouting Fleet who boxed against a team from the Cruise's Battleship fleet.Watson, Don, \\"Scout Fleet Wins Initial Boxing Bout\\", Honolulu Star Bulletin, 5 June 1925, pg. 1 Farrington had worked as Editor for the Honolulu Star-Bulletin prior to becoming governor, and Abe was given several stories in the large local paper.Hollandersky took the 1925 Good Will Cruise to Hawaii in \\"Three Million Dollar Newsboy Will Return to Mainland Soon\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Honolulu, Hawaii, pg. 5, 25 June 1925.Hollandersky arrived in Honolulu by early May in \\"Newsboy Abe is With Us\\", Honolulu Star- Advertiser, pg. 12, 3 May 1925 He left Honolulu on July 29, 1925, after a working vacation of three months, and returned to San Francisco via commercial liner in mid-August, attending the Diamond Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of California statehood.\\"Newsboy Abe Back in San Francisco\\", San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco, California, pg. 15, 12 August 1925 While in San Francisco, he met with Mayor James Rolph who assured him he could continue his work as a movie extra in Los Angeles should he move to the West Coast. Abe had had at least one brief movie role while living in New England.Hollandersky left Honolulu on July 29 in \\"Newsboy Abe Bids Adieu to Honolulu\\", Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Honolulu, Hawaii, pg. 7, 29 July 1925 Rolph had appeared in a few movies himself. Heading north, he helped the Navy with the aftermath of the June 29, 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake. While in the Los Angeles area in late 1925, he posed for a photograph with heavyweight world champion Jack Dempsey and flyweight champion Fidel LaBarba who had several bouts scheduled there late that year. Wearing gloves and boxing shoes in the photo, Dempsey was likely on a break from a sparring session. Dempsey would meet and get to know Abe on several occasions, particularly after the publication of Abe's book.The IP photograph appeared in several newspapers, \\"Famous Boxing Champions Meet Again\\", Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 13, 19 December 1925 Besides appearing in Abe's books, several newspapers ran the photo under the caption, \\"Famous Boxing Champions Meet Again,\\" though Hollandersky's celebrity could hardly compare to Dempsey's. Besides his Central and South American travels between 1912‚Äì1917, his cruises with the Navy took him to locations as afar as Japan, China, Cairo, Melbourne, Brussels, Paris, Rome and London.These locations are taken from a photo signed by acquaintance, British featherweight champion Spike Robson and also in the text of his book, Hollandersky, Abe (1958). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Chapter 22, pg. 407, also London, Paris, Rome, China and Japan in the (1936) edition, Chapter 13, pg. 249 Hollandersky's tally of fights Nat Fleischer's Ring Record Book for 1944 listed around 450 of Hollandersky's bouts, but these were drawn from a nearly identical listing in the back of Hollandersky's autobiography and are mostly unverified. They appear to contain frequent errors in the years the bouts took place and the number of rounds when compared with his BoxRec record.Fleischer, Nat and Andre, Sam (1944). Nat Fleischer's All Time Ring Record Book, pgs. 484‚Äì5. O'Brien Suburban Press, New York. The majority of his fights were exhibitions staged for entertainment and training on Navy ships and bases, and included non-navy exhibitions and a few sparring matches. Dispute will probably continue as to the exact number of boxing matches Hollandersky fought, as his BoxRec record lists only around 100. However, these by definition exclude all his Naval and land based exhibitions, as well as sparring and training matches which he often included in his personal tally.  Benefits and exhibitions  A small sampling of around twenty of the matches he boxed for benefits and exhibitions include: * George Dixon Memorial Fund at Bower's Minery Theatre, New York, January 23, 1908. Hollandersky, said he once sparred with Joe Gans, and the week of this event would have been an opportune time for them to briefly meet, as Gans was present at the memorial and gave a short speech.Joe Gans gave a short speech, \\"Dixon Memorial Fund\\", The New York Times, pg. 8, New York, NY, 23 January 1908.Abe said he once fought Joe Gans in \\"Abe the Newsboy Has Many Claims to Fame\\", The San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco, California, pg. 15, 8 May 1922 * Austin Rice, former World Championship Featherweight contender, exhibition for \\"Nest of Owls order 1382\\", New London CT.

Autobiography, 1930  Hollandersky near White House Southern Facade, after he met with Hoover, 11/8/1929 During one of Abe's few White House visits on November 8, 1929, just a few weeks after the great stock market crash, Hollandersky met briefly with President Herbert Hoover who signed a photograph for Abe's autobiography. Hollandersky may have received rights of passage for travel from the Presidential staff, campaigned for other signed photographs, and asked for book endorsements from Navy brass who advised the President. He soon would return to his home and newspaper shop in Los Angeles. Abe had traveled to the East Coast and New York to complete his biography, as it was first published only four months after his White House visit.Hollandersky met Hoover in Nov, 1929 in the White House according to photo in book of Abe standing in front of White House with caption that photo was taken before \\"entering to pay my respects to the President\\". Abe is wearing same three piece suit and tweed overcoat as in the Library of Congress photo to the right. Photo of Abe at Whitehouse in November carrying large photo notebook, 1929 in Hollandersky, Abe (1953). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, pg. 81.Abe's photo of Hoover says Abe met him in the White House in Hollandersky, Abe (1953). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, pg. 15. Former New York columnist, and inconoclastic author C. L. Edson gave serious assistance to writing Abe's autobiography. Both Abe and Edson were acquaintances of Jewish journalist Walter Winchell. Abe's book had had previous ghostwriters attempt to assist with the publication with less success.Previous ghost writers in Minneapolis Star-Tribune, \\"Abe the Newsboy Sells Ghostbook\\", pg. 14, 30 March 1930 While in New York in 1929, Hollandersky dictated the great majority of the book to Edson, and large portions of the text appear to be copied verbatim from Hollandersky's dictation.Edson was ghost writer inEdson was ghost writer in Hollandersky used newspaper articles from his vast collection of clippings as research, and may have written small portions of the text, including his boxing record, himself. According to historian Abraham Hoffman, up to 20,000 copies of his autobiography may have been printed. These included nearly annual new editions which continued until 1960. The second edition in 1936, added the last three chapters of the book 23‚Äì25, the only notable changes to the original text of the 1930 edition. All editions subsequent to 1936 included only new photographs, largely of Navy ships and Naval acquaintances. The book's content is reliable in most respects, but occasionally Hollandersky's sequencing of events is off. Interview with Damon Runyon, March 1930 On March 24, 1930, playwright, journalist, and one of America's greatest sportswriter's on boxing, Damon Runyon, interviewed Hollandersky about his newly published book for his New York American Sports column \\"Between You and Me.\\"Runyan, Damon., \\"Abe the Newsboy Author Wants to Get Married\\", New York American Sports, pg. 1, New York, 24 March 1930. During his interview, Runyan discussed Abe's independently financed book, and noted his frugality in completing and publishing it prior to marrying. Hollandersky decided to fund the publishing of his autobiography himself, though he had been offered a thousand dollars in 1925 to finance it by his friend Bull Montana. Montana, a former wrestler and Hollywood actor, was a close friend of boxer Jack Dempsey and movie actor and Jewish director Douglas Fairbanks Jr., both of whom Abe claimed to have made movies with. Montana not only appeared in movies with Dempsey but wrestled him in front of the press on several occasions, most notably at a well attended work out in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in June 1921.Dempsey wrestled Montana in \\"Dempsey Finishing Heavy Ring Work\\", The New York Times, New York City, page 2, 27 June 1921Hollandersky, Abe, The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, (1937) Abraham Hollandersky Publisher, Los Angeles, p. 308 Battleship had noted boxing teams Hollandersky often took orders for his autobiography before new editions, particularly the first two, from Navy personnel of the Pacific fleet in San Pedro harbor, and for later editions in San Diego after he moved there around 1946. Three of the many ships from whose crew he took book orders were the , , and . The Arizona and Oklahoma both had noteworthy boxing and wrestling instruction during the years Abe boarded them, and sadly both were badly damaged at Pearl Harbor, with the Arizona becoming a permanent monument after it sank. Abe may have helped with boxing instruction and taken orders for books on the USS Tennessee and USS Nevada, as he had signed photos of several boxers from both ships in his book, and the USS New Mexico, as he posed for a photo with one of their athletic teams. Two other large battleships that Abe boarded with a Liberty Pass and known for their boxing were the USS Texas, and the USS California which was also damaged at Pearl Harbor. He continued to personally sell his book directly to the public during his retirement.Hollandersky, Abe, The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, (1953) Abraham Hollandersky Publisher, Los Angeles, Photos usually appearing in Chapter 11, p. 211Hollandersky, Abe, The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, (1953) Abraham Hollandersky Publisher, Los Angeles, Chapter 20, p. 359, appearing in some earlier versions in Chapter 19.

Cluverius on left of Freda, and JV Chase on right of Abe in tuxedo Hollandersky married Freda Weinberg on June 7, 1931, in Los Angeles, where he had moved permanently in 1928 from New London. He announced his engagement to Freda in a reception on Bellevue Road in Los Angeles on June 2, 1928 at a large party with over 100 friends in attendance.\\"Abe Will Drop Anchor Here to Have Knot Tied\\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 17, 04 June 1928 According to her naturalization papers, Freda, also of Jewish origin, was born in Glasgow, Scotland and had emigrated to the United States from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Not long after they first met, Abe took a cruise to Hawaii in April 1925. Abe began to consider marriage with Freda after meeting her at the small shop she was working at in Los Angeles. They courted for three years before marrying.Hollandersky, Abe (1937). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, Approximate years of Second Australian cruise appear in Chapter 23. Abe claimed several thousand attended his wedding reception at the Jewish Sheltering Home in Los Angeles, including a number of high-ranking naval officers, most notably Admiral Wat Tyler Cluverius, Jr., base commander of the Pacific Fleet. At the time, Cluverius was acting as Chief of Staff for Rear Admiral Jehu V. Chase, the Commander in Chief United States Fleet, who also attended the wedding. Pictures of both men at Hollandersky's wedding reception are featured in his autobiography. Cluverius, as a young Lieutenant, was one of the few survivors of the sinking of the Maine, the incident which led to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. On February 3, 1937, Abe attended a Navy benefit for flood relief organized under the command of Cluverius, at the Long Beach Municipal Auditorium, where he sparred with navy fighter Mike Hector in a brief exhibition. Hector, who had boxed on the USS Tennessee, had been a 1930 Navy boxing champion and an acquaintance of Abe since at least March 1936. Hollandersky stayed in touch with Cluverius after his retirement from the Navy and visited him in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1947 while he was working as President of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.Fontaine, J.

He was often cast as a gangster or boxer. During this period he continued to sell newspapers to the fleet in Long Beach, San Pedro, and on occasion San Diego. He, and his wife Freda operated a small shop and news stand in Long Beach on 715 West Seaside Boulevard not far from the San Pedro Navy pier, where he sold newspapers and items of interest to Navy men including photographs of ships. Movies in which he appeared include Warner Brother's 1926 lost silent film set during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Across the Pacific which featured Monte Blue and Myrna Loy. After his move to L.A., Hollandersky appeared in Fox Film's, 1928 silent film Dressed to Kill with Edumund Lowe and Mary Astor, 20th Century Picture's 1933 The Bowery, and MGM's 1938 The Crowd Roars, among others. Released on February 23, 1930, Hollandersky may have shot his few scenes for Paramount's Roadhouse Nights, when he was back in the New York area to complete his book in late 1929, as the gangster film did most of their shooting in Paramount's Astoria Studios in Brooklyn. On the set of \\"Across the Pacific\\", Hollandersky seated at right with Monte Blue in uniform wearing hat standing directly behind him Hollandersky is shown at right with lead actor Monte Blue on the set of the 1926 version of the silent film Across the Pacific. Hollandersky, third from left, and boss, actor Fred Kohler, seated on right, tallies the take from his seedy subordinates in \\"Roadhouse Nights\\" Hollandersky appeared onscreen in the gangster film about a bootleg operation, Roadhouse Nights with Fred Kohler. Actress Helen Morgan starred and Jimmy Durante made his musical debut in the scarcely remembered film. Hollandersky's right cauliflower ear is visible when the photo is enlarged. In The Bowery, Hollandersky was cast with ex- Middleweight Champion Al McCoy as well as boxers \\"Fireman\\" Jim Flynn, the only man to knockout Jack Dempsey, heavyweight Frank Moran, and fellow Jewish New York boxers Phil Bloom, and Joe Glick. Hungarian born Texan Jack A. Herrick, another ex-boxer turned actor that appeared in the film, had fought in Panama City eighteen years earlier with Abe, and had faced two of the same opponents while there, the great light heavyweight Kid Norfolk, and \\"Steamboat\\" Bill Scott.Boxer Jack Herrick came to Panama because of Abe in, Frank G. Menke, \\"Bettors Against English Polo Team Take Long Chance,\\" El Paso Herald, June 6, 1914. In MGM's 1938 The Crowd Roars, Hollandersky was given a rare brief close up after appearing in a background gymnasium scene with fellow Jewish boxers Larry Williams, Maxie Rosenbloom, Abie Bain, Phil Bloom and Joe Glick, as well as the better known Jimmy McLarnin, one of the greatest boxers of the 1930s and a world champion.Author viewed the film and saw close up of Hollandersky draped with towel after appearance in Gymnasium scene, also see \\"Pretty Boy to HeMan\\", Dallas Morning News, pg. 12, Dallas, TX., 9 August 1938. The film was a commercial success, and starred popular actor Robert Taylor as a boxer caught up in the seamier side of boxing, who while romancing his boss's more refined daughter, comes under the influence of a crime boss. Hollandersky also claimed to have been cast in movies with world champion heavyweight boxers Max Baer and Jack Dempsey who he knew through his friends, wrestler and movie actor Bull Montana, and boxer Larry Williams. He also claimed to have acted with the great actor and movie director Douglas Fairbanks, another close friend of Montana's.He acted with Dempsey and Baer according to Hollandersky, Abe (1958). The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, pgs. 327, 411. Retirement after WWII After WWII, Hollandersky retired to San Diego, where he continued to sell papers. He made appearances, and though sixty years old, still gave occasional boxing exhibitions at the Naval Training Center where he worked with Captains Ralph C. Lynch Jr., and H. C. Gearing. Abe's last place of residence in San Diego was 6056 Meade Avenue.Hollandersky, Abe (1958).

He was made an honorary member of the American Battleship Association which he last attended in Long Beach in 1965.\\"Battleship Navy Sailor's Convention in Long Beach\\", Independent Press Telegram, Long Beach, California, pg. 42, 1 August 1965 He died in San Diego on November 1, 1966, with his funeral service conducted by Rabbi Monroe Levens of Congregation Tiferet Israel. He was buried in San Diego's Greenwood Memorial Park, as was his wife Freda in 1988. He left no children. At his request, his tombstone was headed with his ring name, Abe the Newsboy, the name used almost exclusively by the newspapers that covered his boxing and wrestling career. Legacy Memories of Hollandersky would linger in the mind of some of boxing's greatest. In March 1911, in an interview with the Hartford Courant, Abe claimed to have once sold a paper to Jack Johnson, America's first Black world heavyweight champion. Bob Johnston, of Johnston's Sport's Palace in San Diego, where both Hollandersky and Jack Johnson would live and visit, claimed to have once hired a down and out Johnson in 1929 to shadowbox at his adjacent Liberty Theatre. According to Johnson, the amiable champion often told patrons as he entertained them with shadow boxing that his opponent was Abe the Newsboy.Hollandersky once sold a newspaper to Jack Johnson in \\"Gafilta Fish Champion\\", Hartford Courant, Hartford, Connecticut, pg. 14, 28 March 1911Jack Johnson shadowboxed \\"Abe the Newsboy\\", in \\"Sports Palace, These Days the Game is Wrecking Ball\\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 154, 1 October 1979 Thousands of Hollandersky's autobiography remain in print, and grace the shelves of public libraries, nautical museums, and a few U.S. Naval ship's libraries.

Gray. Hakeem, one of the main characters within the series, is the youngest and once-favorite son of hip-hop mogul Lucious (Terrence Howard) and his wife Cookie (Taraji P. Henson). Hakeem has the star quality to become a superstar like his father, but lacks the discipline and guidance because of his strained relationship with Cookie. Storyline Season 1 Hakeem Lyon was born to Lucious and Cookie Lyon. He grew up in a Philadelphia ghetto with his father, brothers, his cousin Bunkie Williams, and father's friend Vernon Turner. He was only a baby when his mother was arrested; she was helping his father sell drugs to pay for his music career. Hakeem becomes a successful rapper signed to his father's record company, Empire Entertainment. Lucious announces plans to take the company to the NYSE, and he wants to groom Hakeem into his successor and the future CEO. However, Hakeem's arrogance, and lack of wisdom inhibit Lucious from immediately giving him the position. Due to his laziness, Hakeem incessantly asks his older brother and best friend Jamal (Jussie Smollett) to help him write and compose melodies for his songs. Although Hakeem gives his brother credit, Lucious refuses to acknowledge Jamal's musical talent. Once their mother, Cookie, is released from prison, she takes control of Jamal's career. Cookie and Lucious pit Jamal and Hakeem against one another in a competition to see who is more talented and who should be Empire's CEO, with both having upcoming album release dates. Hakeem detests Cookie and repeatedly insults her when she visits him. Hakeem's haughtiness reaches new heights when he makes a viral video condemning Barack Obama and insulting white people. Hakeem begins dating an R&B; singer named Tiana Brown (Serayah McNeill), but has a much older lover named Camilla Marks (Naomi Campbell) whom he sees on the side. Hakeem's oldest brother Andre (Trai Byers) has his wife Rhonda (Kaitlin Doubleday) leak a video of Tiana making out with a female model to the internet. Although initially frustrated and disinterested in continuing his relationship with his bisexual girlfriend, Hakeem decides to pretend that he and Tiana are a couple because Lucious and Cookie believe that the two will sell better together as an act than apart. Andre sees some of Hakeem's gangster associates during a recording of his new music video \\"Drip Drop\\", and has them rob Jamal during one of his recording sessions while pinning the blame on Hakeem, though the robbery fails due to the intervention of the studio engineer. An angry Jamal believes that Hakeem set him up, and punches him in the stomach. The two later make amends after a duo performance during a concert hosted by Empire, after which Lucious informs his family that he has ALS. When Andre only expresses concern about the company's IPO and not his father, Hakeem indignantly tries to fight him, only to be restrained by Jamal. Hakeem begins to improve his relationship with Cookie, but she tries to end his relationship with Camilla because she views it as an unhealthy psychological desire to fill the void as a mother that she left behind when she was imprisoned. Hakeem goes to church to pray for an improvement in Lucious' condition. Meanwhile, his father pays off his lover Camilla to leave the country and Hakeem behind because he believes that she is greedy and only out for Hakeem's money. When Hakeem discovers this, he insults his father during a concert. An angry and disappointed Lucious punches Hakeem, finally deeming him unworthy to inherit the company. Once Lucious gives the company to Jamal, Andre and Hakeem plot to overthrow him. Hakeem tries to sign to Billy Beretti's (Judd Nelson) company, but Jamal coerces Beretti into letting him out of his contract. Hakeem then sleeps with Lucious' ex-fiance Anika Calhoun (Grace Gealey), and he and Andre team with her and his mother to obtain Empire for themselves. Andre tells Hakeem about Lucious' murder of their cousin Bunkie, and the two inform the police. As Lucious is arrested, he realizes that Andre and Hakeem had a hand in his arrest. Season 2 After spoiling the hostile takeover attempt, Hakeem leaves the company with Cookie and Andre to start a new label‚ÄîLyon Dynasty. Hakeem hooks up with Valentina, (Becky G) -- the singer he has chosen to lead his girl group Mirage a Trois. With Jamal promising to bury his album, Hakeem leaks his music online and Jamal threatens to sue him sending Andre back to Empire. With Cookie's assistance, Hakeem quickly prepares the girls for their debut on Sway's radio show. Hakeem is furious when Lucious buys the radio station to keep Lyon Dynasty off the air and signs Valentina to Empire. When both Empire and Lyon Dynasty are investigated by the FBI due to Vernon's recent disappearance, Hakeem once again questions if Lucious killed Bunkie. To present a united front in public, Jamal and Hakeem team up to do a video shoot for \\"Ain't About The Money\\" during which Lucious tries to lure him back to Empire. Hakeem gets jealous of his father's constant praising of Jamal and slashes a painting of Jamal. The brothers then get into a fight and Hakeem walks off set. Hakeem later sees the talented singer Laura (Jamila Velazquez) performing and chooses her to replace Valentina. However, plans go awry when Laura rejects his romantic advances. Hakeem tracks her down and agrees to keep the relationship strictly professional. While working out, Hakeem is kidnapped. After the kidnapping and his rap battle against Freda Gatz, when Lucious' job as CEO and Chairman of Empire is jeopardized, Hakeem, spurned on by Camilla(back from England after marrying Mimi Whiteman), votes against Lucious, causing him to be kicked out of Empire. Being named CEO of Empire, he's urged by Camilla to get rid of his girlfriend Laura. He does by going to Lyon Dynasty while Mirage A Trois is rehearsing, drunk and insults the girls causing them to storm off. He realize he really does love Laura and reconciles with her, promising her to really be together. Later, Hakeem meets with Lucious at the spot where Lucious killed Bunkie, tells him he really killed his uncle, gives him a gun and gives him two options: kill him or spare him and next time he sees Hakeem, he'll do his best to kill him. He turns back and urges Hakeem to point the gun to his head and pull the trigger. Hakeem puts the gun to his head but throws the gun to the ground and walks away. Lucious warns him to watch his back telling him that he keeps his promises. He manages to get rid of Camilla from Empire but he also loses his spot as CEO when Lucious questions his vision at a conference. Anika tells the Lyons that she is pregnant and that Hakeem is the father. Hakeem decides that he wants to be involved in the child's upbringing. He also proposes to Laura and they have their wedding on the last episode but Laura ditches Hakeem at the altar when Shyne Johnson (Xzibit) , an uninvited guest, starts a fight at the wedding. In Season 3, Hakeem drunkenly goes to see Tiana after the failure of his wedding and states that it was always her he loved. He doesn't know that Anika is in the hospital giving birth to his daughter, Bella. Lucious, angry with Hakeem's behaviour, puts his name of the certificate as a legal guardian instead of Hakeem as he is married to Anika. Hakeem tries to get over his wedding humiliation by making music but is interrupted by Shyne and his sister, Nessa (Sierra McClain). Shyne offers to produce for Hakeem. Hakeem eventually agrees to this. He gets involved in a beef with another rapper, Gram (Kid Cudi), who starts dating Tiana and they kiss in front of a surprised Hakeem during a performance. Hakeem responds by recording a diss track to both of them. He begins to develop feelings for Nessa but she is interested in Andre. Hakeem eventually finds out about this from Lucious whilst performing with Jamal in his house on Empire XStream , their streaming service. Hakeem responds by dissing both Andre and Jamal on the live stream, resulting in a huge argument and setting a feud with Andre. Hakeem also begins to develop a bond with his daughter, Bella. When Tiana is set up by Andre and Nessa during a modelling session in which Nessa purposely burnt the dress she was supposed to wear, Hakeem figures out that Andre was responsible for this and confronts him. Nessa ends up taking Tiana's spot. Hakeem comforts Tiana afterwards and during an outdoor performance, he kisses her and tells her he can't wait for her to meet Bella. They both start dating again and Hakeem supports Tiana after she gets in a fight with Nessa when they finish a performance at Leviticus. Hakeem celebrates his 21st birthday at Leviticus but it goes wrong when he lets in some strangers who helped him earlier. One of them assaults one of Tiana's friends and a fight breaks out. Andre shuts down Hakeem's XStream channel, telling him he needs to learn to take responsibilities while Jamal tells him he needs to \\"be a man.\\" Tiana also chastises him for being selfish. He goes to Lucious to collect Bella so he can spend the rest of his birthday with her and this pleases Lucious. Hakeem, with encouragement from Jamal and Cookie, apologises to Tiana's friend via music through Jamal's XStream channel. Hakeem introduces Tiana to Bella and they both bond immediately. When Empire is to take residency in Las Vegas, Hakeem and Tiana have the last laugh over Andre and Nessa when Tory Ash (Rumer Willis) gets Nessa's spot. Whilst at home, Hakeem does an insightful piece on family via his XStream channel. This pleases Lucious and he decides to include Hakeem's name on Bella's certificate. However, Bella is taken away by social services, courtesy of Diana DuBois (Phylicia Rashad). This sends Hakeem into a panic. He follows Anika to the DuBois house and he finds Bella. However, Diana DuBois tells Hakeem that she wants something from him in return. In Season 4, Hakeem has moved to Los Angeles. He is in a relationship with Tiana and raising his daughter, Bella. However, he has Diana DuBois coming round to visit Bella. He doesn't tell his family about this. When Anika is released, she comes to have access to Bella but Hakeem refuses, saying that Bella needs to get to know her again. Anika retaliates by applying for sole custody of Bella with support from Angelo (Taye Diggs). Hakeem gets in a panic and he finds out that Diana DuBois is behind the scheme. He assaults Angelo when he tries to see Diana and he decides to run away with Bella and Tiana to Cuba. However, Tiana tells Cookie and she meets Hakeem at the airport and tells him she can't lose him and that they will fight in court. The case goes to court and it looks like Hakeem is going to win the case but Diana turns up as a late witness and Hakeem's secret is exposed - when he met with Diana secretly, she had recorded everything he said about his family. He described Lucious as the devil, says he wishes Cookie was still in prison, calls Andre crazy and unstable and expresses unhappiness with Jamal's drug addiction. The judge awards full custody to Anika, devastating Hakeem. He splits up with Tiana after she crumbles in the witness stand. He spies on Anika and Angelo with Bella but is stopped by Thurston 'Thirsty' Rawlings (Andre Royo). After another argument with Tiana, resulting in her slapping him, Hakeem is given advice from Shyne about raising kids. He later goes to support Jamal, who is nursing a broken heart and they make music together. When the Lyons crash the Captain's Ball held by the DuBois, Hakeem and Jamal perform a song that disses Diana. After Diana's cover is blown by Cookie, Hakeem confronts Anika. He tells her that he is aware that when Bella was kidnapped, she knew where she was, making her accessory to the kidnapping and he has the videos as evidence. Anika begs Hakeem not to send her back to prison but Hakeem says he doesn't want Bella to grow up without her mom the way he did. He makes her sign the papers handing Bella back to him and he tells Anika that the fighting stops now and to never forget that he has the videos. Hakeem supports Andre, who was sectioned due to his relapse, and Jamal, who accidentally shot Angelo dead. He gets back with Tiana and proposes to her. However, she turns him down, saying that she needs no distractions from her career. She was influenced by Eddie Barker (Forest Whitaker), a family friend of the Lyons now turned enemy. After it is revealed that Andre almost killed Lucious, Hakeem stops talking to him. Hakeem, worried, prays when Cookie has a heart attack. Shyne encourages Hakeem to be a mentor to other artists and he meets Blake Sterling (Chet Hanks). Hakeem takes him under his wing whilst still being shut out by Tiana. When it is announced that Tiana has hit Number 1 on both the pop and R&B; charts, Hakeem sets about releasing a new single to dominate the charts and he has a single launch with help from Andre, who he has reconciled with. It looks like he is going to make up with Tiana but she leaves him again after they sleep together. Hakeem is given an opportunity to act in a film alongside well known actress, Haven Quinn (Cassie Ventura). Unfortunately for Hakeem, the director is racist and ends up firing him after they have an argument. Haven, who was initially hostile to Hakeem, is impressed by him standing up to the director and makes it clear she likes him. Hakeem invites her to an Empire event and they kiss in front of Tiana. Hakeem and Blake fall out when Hakeem learns that Blake's father is a racist and a picture of Blake doing a Nazi salute is shown in public. They make up by the next episode when it turns out that Blake was forced to do that salute. Hakeem and Haven begin a casual relationship which ends when Haven tells him that she, too, was in a messy relationship and tells him to call her if he has any trouble again with Tiana. After the Lyons lose Empire, Tiana tracks down Hakeem and tells him that she is pregnant with his child. They reconcile but when they are about to leave the house, Blake's father shows up with a shotgun and fires 3 shots at Hakeem, Tiana and Blake. In the season 5 premiere, it is revealed that Hakeem was shot. He loses a lung and is recovering. He has a son, Prince, with Tiana. Unfortunately things are not going well at home as he is always arguing with Tiana, getting drunk, getting into fights and carrying guns. Hakeem is talked into performing to support Tiana. He performs to a backing track but he coughs during performance and he asks Blake to take over. Hakeem goes to Jamal's flat to stay for a bit and he pulls a gun on Jamal's new boyfriend, Kai. Hakeem chastises Jamal for abandoning him after he was shot. Hakeem's relationship with Andre has deteriorated due to Hakeem finding out Andre was responsible for Anika's death. When Hakeem turns up to Empire headquarters drunk, Cookie and Lucious intervene and let Hakeem stay with them. Hakeem works with Jamal, who teaches him breathing techniques to help him rap. Hakeem is released from Empire after he clashes with Jeff Kingsley (A.Z. Kelsey), who is trying to wipe out the Lyon's legacy. Hakeem dreams up a song which describes his feelings on the shooting amongst over things. He writes the lyrics and gives the song to Blake, who agrees to record it. However, Tiana gets involved on the track and Blake fails to tell her that Hakeem wrote the track. This becomes a problem later when the song is released and Hakeem finds out, resulting in a huge fight with Blake. Hakeem is removed from the club and he argues with Tiana. It is then revealed that Tiana had a miscarriage as she was expecting twins. Prince survived but the little girl, Princess, didn't. Hence why Hakeem has been acting out. Hakeem and Tiana take a break from each other and Hakeem releases a diss track towards Blake. This causes concern amongst the other Lyons, most notably Cookie and Andre. Andre manages to get through to Hakeem, saying that he never meant to hurt him or Bella. Blake responds back with a diss of his own but Hakeem refuses to bite back, telling his fans that he is concentrating on his kids. However, Tiana tells him that he needs to squash the beef with Blake as his fans are threatening the kids. Hakeem confronts Blake about this but pulls his gun on him when Blake refuses to apologise for his role in the beef. Hakeem tells Blake to fix this. Tiana is furious with Hakeem and is about to leave when Bella rushes into the corridor holding Hakeem's gun towards herself. Hakeem sings a lullaby which settles Bella before taking the gun from her. Lucious speaks to Hakeem after the incident, telling him it's not too late for him to turn his life around for the better as he has not killed anyone. Hakeem talks to Tiana and they split up. Hakeem then squashes the beef with Blake and the three of them perform on stage. Hakeem is very unhappy when he finds out that Kingsley is his half brother. He clashes with Maya (Rhyon Nicole Brown), who is adding ballet to his performance but they manage to work it out. Hakeem is promoted to Creative Director at Empire and during the Empire trust tour he performs a tribute to Andre with Jamal as Andre has cancer. Hakeem gets jealous when Tiana takes an interest in Devon (Mario) but he spends most of his time with his kids. Creation and development Gray said of the character's origins: \\"[the show's writer] Danny Strong influences the character. Kanye, Justin Bieber's antics‚Äînot Justin Bieber himself but his antics, snapping out to the world, doing rants‚ÄîHakeem embodies hip-hop and situations that occur in the hip-hop industry. He's that. You all get to see Chris Brown and you get to see the rappers and Jay Z, but you don't really get to see their lives. And that's what they're doing with Hakeem. They're going behind a wall that artists have up.\\" Casting and portrayal On March 6, 2014, it was announced that Bryshere Y. Gray commonly known as rapper \\"Yazz The Greatest\\" had been cast in the role of Hakeem, the youngest son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie Lyon (Taraji P. Henson). This was Gray's first acting gig. The role was initially to be played by actor, rapper and singer Quincy, the son of hip hop mogul, Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs. However, Diddy not agree with contractual obligations for the musical aspect of the series. Hakeem has the \\"swagger of a rising superstar\\" and is favored by Lucious to run the company. Gray found out about the audition from his manager, Charlie Mack and did a video audition for Lee Daniels. Gray then flew to Los Angeles where screen tested with Howard and Henson. Gray said it was Howard who instructed him to dig deeper during the screen test that helped him land the role. The audition was Gray's very first acting experience opposite. He later sought formal training to prepare for the role. Gray revealed that he was close to being evicted when he finally booked the role of Hakeem. Gray took advice from actors Will Smith and Jamie Foxx in preparing for the role when they told him \\"if you feel like you're embarrassed, when you're acting, you're doing something perfect.\\" Lee Daniels revealed that he patterned the character of Hakeem after his own 19-year-old son who like Hakeem, grew up very differently from his father because of Daniels' success. Like Hakeem, Daniels said \\"My son wouldn't know how to work right now, because I wanted him to have everything that I didn't have... . and now what?\\" Personality Bryshere Y. Gray revealed that he personally tried to avoid borrowing from the personalities of real life artists in his portrayal of Hakeem. Gray described Hakeem as \\"disrespectful, ruthless, spoiled and the 'heart throb' of the Lyon family.\\" According to Gray, Hakeem is a lot like Lucious which is why he treats people so badly. \\"Hakeem doesn't really know how to respect females\\" because Lucious was his only example. \\"He really is a product of his habitat.\\" However, \\"Hakeem doesn't have the ambition\\" that Lucious had. Because he's been handed everything, he doesn't feel like he has to work hard. \\"It's obvious he has mommy issues\\" the actor declared. When Hakeem is hurting, he acts out and usually does things he doesn't mean. Gray has said that his skills as a rapper gives his character \\"bravado.\\" Gray said the role is \\"challenging\\" because Hakeem is \\"reckless\\" and he lacks the proper \\"guidance.\\" Hakeem is a \\"spoiled, young brat and a bit of womanizer,\\" Gray stated. Hakeem can learn from his mistakes, but he has to make them first. \\"He's a kid that's trying to grow\\" and he \\"doesn't think\\" before he speaks. Hakeem is the kind of kid that would \\"want to be president\\" if he got the chance, despite the fact that he doesn't have the experience; \\"he wants the glitz and the [glamour]\\" but he lacks the drive to get there. \\"I basically made Hakeem my own\\" Gray said on his portrayal of the character. \\"I had to make people uncomfortable and make people hate me\\" he continued. When asked who he modeled Hakeem after, Gray said \\"I packed rappers who are out today and tried to be honest.\\" Aside from the musicality, \\"Hakeem is the total opposite of me,\\" Gray said of his character. \\"He's the antithesis. He's so spoiled, he's so rich.\\" When asked if he and could ever be friends with Hakeem, Gray responded, \\"Hakeem is an idiot. Yazz is a sweetheart.\\" Gray made a conscious effort to keep Hakeem \\"honest\\" and with \\"no limits.\\" Though Hakeem isn't \\"mature enough to have the company,\\" he thinks he is entitled to it. Hakeem is \\"trying to get attention doing dumb things.\\" However, Gray admitted that even he was surprised when Hakeem attacked President Barack Obama in the press. Show runner Ilene Chaiken said the Hakeem \\"changes and grows the most\\" throughout season 2. Gray himself later revealed that Hakeem goes through a \\"transition\\" in the second season; \\"his mind is somewhere else.\\" Chaiken said, Hakeem is \\"teetering on that precipice on being a man who's overcome a lot of childish, foolish behavior.\\" Hakeem is \\"so strong\\" as long as Cookie is by his side, but he can't handle the pressure without her. Much like his father, Hakeem is \\"moved by talent\\" and \\"he really is a mogul in a way that neither of his brothers are.\\" Hakeem is becoming the man Lucious initially envisioned him to be‚Äîbut he has to earn it. Relationships Though Lucious favors Hakeem, Lucious blames Hakeem when he screws up failing to understand that he does not lead by example. While Hakeem wants to \\"satisfy Lucious\\" and live up to his expectations, he leans on Jamal for \\"advice -- especially on music.\\" Hakeem and Jamal have a strong bond because as kids, Jamal was the only person Hakeem had. \\"Jamal is the person that Hakeem tells every secret to\\" because he knows Jamal won't judge him. Hakeem knows how good he and Jamal can be together. Throughout season 1, the duo are at odds for several reasons, but usually make up. With their new success, Gray said \\"It's about if they're going to stick together through the new adventures in their life.\\" Because he had no contact with her for 17 years, Hakeem struggles to accept or even respect his mother. Cookie's return only reminds Hakeem of how \\"very hurt\\" he is. Their relationship is very confrontational, which is displayed in their very first scene in which he calls her out of her name, and she beats him with a broom. While the actor did not agree with Hakeem's treatment of his mother, he understood it. \\"A mother-and-son relationship is very important.\\" And to miss out on that for 17 years only to have Cookie suddenly show up, Hakeem is \\"thrown off.\\" Gray who grew up without his own father can identify with Hakeem's reaction because his father came back into his life after he landed the role of Hakeem. He has a lot \\"emotions\\" attached to his relationship with Cookie and it will take time for him to \\"let it go.\\" Gray said that Hakeem is \\"emotionally and mentally hurt by [Cookie's absence] so he goes out and loves older women because he gets this type of affection that he hasn't gotten from his mother.\\" Hakeem feels a sense of \\"security\\" in his romance with the much older Camilla Marks, played by Naomi Campbell. She teaches him the things that Cookie couldn't. Though Hakeem \\"deeply\\" loves Camilla, he also takes an interest in label mate Tiana (Serayah McNeill). While he initially thinks their relationship is all fun and games, Hakeem starts to develop real feelings for her. However, when he realizes she might not feel the same way, it pushes his buttons. Gray said \\"Hakeem is all in his emotions\\" when he finds out Tiana has a \\"sidepiece\\" even though he is also seeing Camilla. \\"He's just being a little brat and not being a man and owning up to his actions. So... he's not talking to her. Tiana will be back.\\" By season 2, Hakeem and Tiana's relationship has developed beyond their former romance. \\"Tiana's family now\\" as far as Hakeem is concerned. While there is still some underlying flirtation, \\"it's almost a sibling relationship\\" according to show runner Ilene Chaiken. In the season 2 premiere, Hakeem starts a short lived romance with singer Valentina (Becky G) whom has he chosen as the lead singer of his girl group. In July 2015, E! Online reported that Hakeem would pursue talented singer Laura, \\"professionally and personally\\" throughout season 2. However, Laura is not interested in romance. Played by Jamila Velazquez, Laura \\"plays an important relationship role [as] a love interest for Hakeem.\\" Laura is introduced in episode 2.04 when Hakeem who in looking for a new lead singer for his girl group witnesses her performance at a nightclub. \\"It amounts to a different experience and a different relationship for Hakeem\\" Chaiken said of the character's dynamic with Laura. However Hakeem and Anika end up having sex which is later shown that she is pregnant Hakeem's relationship with Laura is on the line and he proposes to her but their wedding is ruined and she leaves him. Hakeem's daughter Bella is born and he struggles to be good father even though Luscious has to be the legal father for publicity. Hakeem reconciles with Tiana and very soon she is pregnant with his child. They marry and their son Prince is born. Reception The character of Hakeem initially received mixed reactions from viewers and critics. Life+Times described Hakeem as a \\"love to hate\\" character. Jozen Cummings from Billboard declared Hakeem as the least likable character in the series. Cummings gave a scathing review of the character. \\"The hate for Hakeem knows no bounds. He doesn't have any redeemable qualities to speak of... . He may be fictional, but my disgust for him is very real.\\" Complex magazine described Hakeem as the show's answer to \\"Tyga and Kid Ink.\\" The character immediately stirs up controversy when he verbally attacks President Barack Obama in the press. Of the character's growth and acceptance of his mother, Los Angeles Times said \\"we can put the brooms away; he's finally acting his age, not his shoe size.\\" Sadie Gennis of TV Guide said the character had taken Jamal's place as the \\"anchor\\" during the second season of the show. Gennis described Hakeem as the \\"constant amidst the chaos\\" of the season. He is \\"something real to hang onto.\\" Gennis said her investment in Hakeem stemmed from the character's motives being so easy to understand and his intriguing dynamics with the other characters‚Äîspecifically his parents' and brother Jamal. For the 2015 Teen Choice Awards, Gray was nominated for the \\"Choice TV: Breakout Star.\\" References External links * Hakeem Lyon at the Internet Movie Database Category:Empire (2015 TV series) Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional cannabis users Category:Fictional musicians Category:Fictional rappers Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 Category:Fictional characters from Philadelphia Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Hakeem Lyon"},{"id":"45752437","text":"Lisa L. Moore is a Canadian-born American academic and poet. She is known for her writing about lesbian literature, art and garden history, and poetry.  Life and education  Lisa Moore was born in Calgary, Canada. Principal themes in Moore‚Äôs work include the centrality of love between women to literary genres such as the novel, the landscape arts, and the sonnet; the transatlantic and multi-racial history of feminist art and thinking; and the importance of poetry to second-wave feminist, womanist, and lesbian cultures and politics.

The military role of unmanned aircraft systems is growing at unprecedented rates. In 2005, tactical- and theater-level unmanned aircraft alone had flown over 100,000 flight hours in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, in which they are organized under Task Force Liberty in Afghanistan and Task Force ODIN in Iraq. Rapid advances in technology are enabling more and more capability to be placed on smaller airframes, which is spurring a large increase in the number of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) being deployed on the battlefield. The use of SUAS in combat is so new that no formal DoD wide reporting procedures have been established to track SUAS flight hours. As the capabilities grow for all types of UAS, nations continue to subsidize their research and development, leading to further advances and enabling them to perform a multitude of missions. UAS no longer only perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, although this still remains their predominant type. Their roles have expanded to areas including electronic attack, drone strikes, suppression or destruction of enemy air defense, network node or communications relay, combat search and rescue, and derivations of these themes. These UAS range in cost from a few thousand dollars to tens of millions of dollars, with aircraft ranging from less than one pound to over 40,000 pounds. Classifications by the United States military The modern concept of U.S. military UAVs is to have the various aircraft systems work together in support of personnel on the ground. The integration scheme is described in terms of a \\"Tier\\" system and is used by military planners to designate the various individual aircraft elements in an overall usage plan for integrated operations. The Tiers do not refer to specific models of aircraft but rather roles for which various models and their manufacturers competed. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps each has its own tier system, and the two systems are themselves not integrated. Use in the \\"War on Terror\\" The Obama administration announced the deployment of 30,000 new troops in Afghanistan in December 2009, but there was already an increase of attacks by unmanned Predator UAVs against Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal areas, one of which probably killed a key member of al-Qaeda. However, neither Osama bin Laden nor Ayman al-Zawahiri was the likely target, according to reports. According to a report of the New America Foundation, armed UAV strikes had dramatically increased under President Obama, even before his deployment decision. There were 43 such attacks between January and October 2009. The report draws on what it deems to be \\"credible\\" local and national media stories about the attacks. This can be compared to a total of 34 in all of 2008, which was President Bush's last full year in office. Between 2006 and 2009, UAV-launched missiles allegedly had killed between 750 and 1,000 people in Pakistan, according to the report. Of these, about 20 people were said to be leaders of al-Qaeda, Taliban, and associated groups. Overall, 66- to 68-percent of the people killed were militants, and 31- to 33-percent were civilians. U.S. officials disputed the percentage for civilians. The U.S. Air Force has recently begun referring to larger UAS as Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), such as Predator, Reaper, and Global Hawk, to highlight the fact that these systems are always controlled by a human operator at some location. CIA- ordered drone strikes were ended by President Obama, who transferred control entirely to the military under a separate legal authority. President Trump reversed this decision in 2017.Trump Restores CIA Power To Launch Drone Strikes UAVs and Morality Dr. Peter Lee is a Portsmouth University Lecturer in military and leadership ethics specializing in the ethics and ethos of remotely piloted aircraft. In his paper, Rights, Wrongs and Drones: Remote Warfare, Ethics and the Challenge of Just War, he claims that no weapon system has prompted more debate, speculation and opposition since the nuclear controversies of the 1980s (pg 21). While the issues of individual rights, legality and morality, have advanced over a decade. In this advancement, the moral arguments surrounding war have shifted from state-centric to individually focused which may have significant consequences for the moral component of fighting power as understood by western powers. In an article published by NPR titled \\"The Legal and Moral Issues of Drone Use\\", Amitai Etzioni, professor of International Affairs and Sociology at George Washington University, states that while drones have been successful in fighting Al- Qaida, and Taliban members, 24% of kills have been civilian casualties. Etzioni postulates that civilian casualties have given rise to increased violence around the Afghan-Pakistan border resulting in an uptick of suicide attacks. Yet, she considers drone strikes to be ‚Äúcleaner instruments of war‚Äù than special ops, or bombings, justifying the use of them in a utilitarian sense. For example, when the leader of the Pakistani Taliban was killed by a drone strike, his father-in-law and wife were also killed. During the Obama administration, the state department's top lawyer, Harold Koh, stated that U.S. has the authority under international law to defend its citizens from terrorist organizations by using lethal force, and targeting leaders of Al- Qaida and the Taliban. The UN's Study on Armed Unmanned Aerial Vehicles supports Harold's statement through the ambiguity of the law surrounding ‚Äúimminent armed attacks‚Äù, ‚ÄúImminent‚Äù means ‚Äúinstant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation‚Äù (pg 38). This preventive measure of self-defense against terrorism is justified on the basis of the difficulty of foreseeing an attack by seemingly unpredictable non-state actors like Al-Qaida or the Taliban. Terrorism poses an impending threat that justifies drone strikes even if it means the death of innocent civilians. However, as stated by Dr. Peter Lee, the shift towards individual focused moral arguments have hidden the violations of the rules of war by terrorist organizations under the mask of sovereign citizenship. As Etzioni states, ‚ÄúThey want to violate the rules of war on the one hand and then be protected on the other. You can't have it both ways.‚Äù The first Committee of the UN General Assembly saw its very first side event on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, on Friday October 23, 2015. According to the UN, an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have shown interest in the use of both commercial and military use of drones. One of the panel experts, Mr. Zwijnenburg concluded the meeting by stating that clarity surrounding drone strikes is necessary to provide the international community for the legal interpretation of international humanitarian laws and frameworks related to targeted killings and civilian killings because of it. 1\\\\.

Maaike Verbruggen, United Nations. Published 2015. https://www.un.org/disarmament/update/discussing- drones-at-the-un-headquarters-2/ Armed attacks by U.S. UAVs MQ-1 Predator UAVs armed with Hellfire missiles have been used by the U.S. as platforms for hitting ground targets. Armed Predators were first used in late 2001 from bases in Pakistan and Uzbekistan, mostly aimed at assassinating high-profile individuals (terrorist leaders, etc.) inside Afghanistan. Since then, there have been many reported cases of such attacks taking place in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.Sauer, Frank/Sch√∂rnig Niklas, 2012: Killer drones: The ‚Äòsilver bullet‚Äô of democratic warfare? , in: Security Dialogue 43 (4): 363‚Äì380. Retrieved 1 September 2012. The advantage of using an unmanned vehicle rather than a manned aircraft in such cases is to avoid a diplomatic embarrassment should the aircraft be shot down and the pilots captured, since the bombings take place in countries deemed friendly and without the official permission of those countries. A Predator based in a neighboring Arab country was used to kill suspected al-Qaeda terrorists in Yemen on 3 November 2002. This marked the first use of an armed Predator as an attack aircraft outside of a theater of war such as Afghanistan. The U.S. has claimed that the Predator strikes killed at least nine senior al-Qaeda leaders and dozens of lower-ranking operatives, depleting its operational tier in what U.S. officials described as the most serious disruption of al-Qaeda since 2001. It was claimed that the Predator strikes took such a toll on al-Qaeda that militants began turning violently on one another out of confusion and distrust. A senior U.S. counter-terrorism official said: \\"They have started hunting down people who they think are responsible [for security breaches]. People are showing up dead, or disappearing.\\" By October 2009, the CIA claimed to have killed more than half of the 20 most wanted al-Qaeda terrorist suspects in targeted killings using UAVs. By May 2010, counter-terrorism officials said that UAV strikes in the Pakistani tribal areas had killed more than 500 militants since 2008 and no more than 30 (5%) nearby civilians ‚Äì mainly family members who lived and traveled with the targets. UAVs linger overhead after a strike, in some cases for hours, to enable the CIA to count the bodies and attempt to determine which, if any, are civilians. A Pakistani intelligence officer gave a higher estimate of civilian casualties, saying 20% of total deaths were civilians or non-combatants. In February 2013, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham stated that 4,756 people have been killed by U.S. UAVs. CIA officials became concerned in 2008, that targets in Pakistan were being tipped off to pending U.S. UAV strikes by Pakistani intelligence, when the U.S. requested Pakistani permission prior to launching UAV-based attacks. The Bush administration therefore decided in August 2008 to abandon the practice of obtaining Pakistani government permission before launching missiles from UAVs, and in the next six months the CIA carried out at least 38 Predator strikes in northwest Pakistan, compared with 10 in 2006 and 2007 combined. One issue with using armed drones to attack human targets is the size of the bombs being used and the relative lack of discrimination of the Hellfire, which was designed to eliminate tanks and attack bunkers. Smaller weapons such as Raytheon's Griffin and Pyros are being developed as a less indiscriminate alternative, and development is underway on the still smaller US Navy- developed Spike missile. The payload-limited Predator A can also be armed with six Griffin missiles, as opposed to only two of the much-heavier Hellfires. Public opinion in the US (military use) In 2013, a Fairleigh Dickinson University poll found that 48% of American voters believe it is \\"illegal for the U.S. government to target its own citizens living abroad with drone attacks.\\"Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind. (7 February 2013) Public Say It's Illegal to Target Americans Abroad as Some Question CIA Drone Attacks Press release. In the same poll, however, a majority of voters approved of the U.S. military and the CIA using UAVs to carry out attacks abroad ‚Äúon people and other targets deemed a threat to the U.S.‚Äù. There are a number of critics of the use of UAVs to track and kill terrorists and militants. A major criticism of drone strikes is that they result in excessive collateral damage. However, others maintain that drones \\"allow for a much closer review and much more selective targeting process than do other instruments of warfare\\" and are subject to Congressional oversight. Like any military technology, armed UAVs will kill people, combatants and innocents alike, thus \\"the main turning point concerns the question of whether we should go to war at all.\\" Infrastructure In 2012, the USAF trained more UAV pilots than ordinary jet fighter pilots for the first time. Unlike other UAVs, the Predator was armed with Hellfire missiles so that it can terminate the target that it locates.Carafano, J., & Gudgel, A. (2007). The Pentagon‚Äôs robots: Arming the future [Electronic version]. Backgrounder 2093, 1‚Äì6. This was done after Predators sighted Osama Bin Laden multiple times but could not do anything about it other than send back images. In addition, the Predator is capable of orchestrating attacks by pointing lasers at the targets.Singer, P. (2009b). Wired for war: The robotics revolution and conflict in the 21st century. New York: Penguin Group. This is important, as it puts a robot in a position to set off an attack. Their overall success is apparent because from June 2005 to June 2006 alone, Predators carried out 2,073 missions and participated in 242 separate raids.Singer, P. (2009a). Military robots and the laws of war [Electronic version]. The New Atlantis: A Journal of Technology and Society, 23, 25‚Äì45 In contrast to the Predator, which is remotely piloted via satellites, the Global Hawk operates virtually autonomously.Singer, Peter W. \\"A Revolution Once More: Unmanned Systems and the Middle East\\" , The Brookings Institution, November 2009. The user merely hits the button for ‚Äòtake off‚Äô and for ‚Äòland‚Äô, while the UAV gets directions via GPS and reports back with a live feed. Global Hawks have the capability to fly from San Francisco and map out the entire state of Maine before having to return. In addition, some UAVs have become so small that they can be launched from one's hand and maneuvered through the street. These UAVs, known as Ravens, are especially useful in urban areas, such as Iraq, in order to discover insurgents and potential ambushes the next block up.Carafano, J., & Gudgel, A. (2007). The Pentagon‚Äôs robots: Arming the future [Electronic version]. Backgrounder 2093. UAVs are especially useful because they can fly for days at a time. Insurgents in the open for more than a few minutes at a time fear UAVs locating them. In the U.S., thousands of civilian UAV operators work for contractors, piloting and maintaining UAVs. Up to four UAVs and about 400 to 500 pilot and ground support personnel are required for a single 24-hour-coverage combat air patrol (CAP). A 2011 study by the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine indicated that nearly 50% of spy UAV operators suffer from high stress. The president of a civilian UAV operators' union, the Association of Unmanned Operation (AUO), cited long working hours and decreasing wages as U.S. involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was reduced and as a result of the U.S. government's budget sequestration. Given the increasing military use of cyber attacks against Microsoft software, the United States Armed Forces have moved towards Linux ground control software.Thomson, Iain. \\"US Navy buys Linux to guide drone fleet.\\" The Register, 8 June 2012.Leyden, John. \\"US killer spy drone controls switch to Linux.\\" The Register, 12 January 2012. Scale of use An August 2013, Brookings Institution study reported that in the U.S. Air Force there were approximately 1,300 remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) pilots, 8.5 percent of total Air Force pilots, up from 3.3 percent in 2008. The study indicated that the U.S. military's combat air patrol (CAP) daily missions requirement is growing at a faster pace than RPA pilots can be trained, with an attrition rate during RPA flight screening being three times that of traditional pilots and a 13% lower promotion rate to Major than other officers. ‚Ä¢ Referenced by As of January 2014, the U.S. military operates a large number of unmanned aerial systems: 7,362 RQ-11 Ravens; 990 AeroVironment Wasp IIIs; 1,137 AeroVironment RQ-20 Pumas; and 306 RQ-16 T-Hawk small UAS systems and 246 Predators and MQ-1C Gray Eagles; 126 MQ-9 Reapers; 491 RQ-7 Shadows; and 33 RQ-4 Global Hawk large systems. As of mid-2014, the U.S. Air Force is training more drone pilots than fighter and bomber pilots combined. Research and development An example of drone countermeasures At the center of the American military's continued UAV research is the MQ-X, which builds upon the capabilities of the Reaper and Predator UAVs. As currently conceived, the MQ-X would be a stealthier and faster fighter-plane sized UAV capable of any number of missions: high-performance surveillance; attack options, including retractable cannons and bomb or missile payloads; and cargo capacity.Singer, Peter W. \\"How the US Military Can Win the Robotic Revolution\\", The Brookings Institution, 17 May 2010. Development costs for American military UAVs, as with most military programs, have tended to overrun their initial estimates. This is mostly due to changes in requirements during development and a failure to leverage UAV development programs over multiple armed services. This has caused United States Navy UAV programs to increase in cost from 0% to 5%, while United States Air Force UAV programs have increased from 60% to 284%. The USAF said in 2012 that it will focus on development of UAVs capable of collaborative networking with manned aircraft in \\"buddy attacks\\" or flying as standalone systems.Majumdar, Dave. \\"Anti-access/area denial challenges give manned aircraft edge over UAVs.\\" Flight Global, 25 July 2012. The U.S. Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) planned in 2014 to award grants and contracts up to $5.5 million each, for its Fast Lightweight Autonomy Program (FLAP) program, which specifies UAVs capable of traveling 60 feet per second to include autonomy algorithms for quickly and autonomously navigating indoor obstacles and learning from past travels.

Sheriff went on to work 5 years as Senior Vice-President of Development with Seiscom-Delta Corporation before moving to academia at the University of Houston. He served as a tenured professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences for 23 years before retiring. He served as Professor Emeritus after his retirement. Sheriff was one of the originators of the geophysical topic, attributes, and is coauthor of what some consider the seminal article in the field,Complex trace analysis (GEOPHYSICS, 1979).M. T.

Society of Exploration Geophysicists  Sheriff served as First Vice President for Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) from 1972-73. In 1969, Sheriff received the SEG Virgil Kauffman Medal for his initial publication of the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Exploration Geophysics. Sheriff received SEG's highest award in 1998, the Maurice Ewing Award, for his lifetime achievements in geophysics. In 2006, SEG members voted the 1973 dictionary as the top geophysical book ever published for the industry, citing a copy could be found in every working exploration office. As Lee Lawyer pointed out in Sheriff‚Äôs citation for the Maurice Ewing Medal, Sheriff was in the forefront of such major trends in geophysical theory as hydrocarbon indicators, sequence stratigraphy, and reservoir geophysics. In addition, he was responsible for the first poster session at an SEG Annual Meeting, arranged the SEG technical presentations at the first two Offshore Technology Conferences, and co- organized industry-academic seminars to expedite transfer of knowledge between campus and industry.  Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics  Sheriff created a 30-page pamphlet to support his training classes as well as help train employees on the latest concepts in geophysics. After a past SEG president received the pamphlet, the president recommended to the SEG membership that the document be expanded. This document served as the foundation for what would become the Encyclopedic Dictionary. It transformed from a 30-page glossary to 429 pages in its 4th edition. Each subsequent edition of the dictionary saw significant increases in the number of terms. The third edition (published in 1991) contained 20% more entries than the second (published in 1984). The fourth (published in 2002) had 61 more pages of definitions than the third. For over four decades Sheriff updated the dictionary to reflect the latest technology and research in geophysics.

For many years she was the assistant of Dolores Ib√°rruri, leader of the Spanish Communist Party, and she is best known for this role. After the Spanish Civil War she was forced into exile in Moscow and Beijing. She returned to Spain after the return to democracy in 1977. Early years Irene Lewy Rodr√≠guez was born in Madrid on 27 November 1907, the second of three sisters. Her father was Siegried Levy Herzberg, a middle-class Polish Jew. Her father died when she was five, and to survive her mother rented rooms in their house in the Calle de Trafalgar. Irene was educated at the German College and learned four languages. She obtained a position as a librarian for Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal (1852‚Äì1934). He was a biologist who won the Nobel Prize. C√©sar Falc√≥n (1892‚Äì1970), Irene Falc√≥n's husband In 1922 Irene Lewy met the Peruvian journalist C√©sar Falc√≥n (1892‚Äì1970), and fell in love. Two years later the newspaper El Sol asked Falc√≥n to move to London as a correspondent. They married, and Irene accompanied him. She was contracted as correspondent by the daily La Voz (The Voice), a Spanish newspaper. Their son Mayo was born in London in May 1926 but was not registered at the Spanish consulate due to concerns with the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. Irene and C√©sar returned to Spain after Primo de Rivera fell in 1930. The Falc√≥ns published Historia Nueva (New History) and launched the party Izquierda Revolucionaria y Antiimperialista (IRYA: Anti-Imperialist Revolutionary Left). Irene founded the feminist organization Mujeres Antifascistas (Anti-Fascist Women). She edited a collection of books by women, the best feminist literature of the time, including work by Doris Langley Moore, Vera Inber and Dora Russell, wife of Bertrand Russell, whom Irene had met in London. Irene wrote in the preface to Dora Russell's Hypatia, Communist activist Dolores Ib√°rruri in 1936 The Falc√≥ns joined the Spanish Communist Party in 1932, when IRYA merged into that party. There Irene met Dolores Ib√°rruri, known as Pasionaria. They lost their jobs with the newspapers, and lived in poverty in a slum in Madrid. They formed the Teatro Proletario, a theater group. This group, also called Nosotros (\\"Us\\"), was formed in 1933 and performed work by Maxim Gorky and the classic anti-war drama Hinkemann by Ernst Toller. In the summer of 1933 they visited Moscow with the Teatro Proletario group. The Soviet press reported in depth on their performances. The Spanish Committee of Women against War and Fascism, affiliated with the World Committee Against War and Fascism, was created with a committee controlled by the PCE. In August 1934 the Spanish committee sent a delegation to the World Congress of Women against War and Fascism in Paris. Ib√°rruri led the group, which included two Republicans and two Communists, Encarnaci√≥n Fuyola and Irene Falc√≥n. The Spanish committee was dissolved in October 1934 during the repression that followed the Asturian miners' strike. In 1934 Irene went to Moscow as correspondent of Mundo Obrero (Worker's World), the PCE newspaper. She returned to Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) to help Dolores Ib√°rruri, and became her close colleague and friend until Ib√°rruri's death in November 1989. She used the pseudonym \\"Toboso\\". Early in March 1939 she helped arrange the evacuation of senior party members from Spain. Ib√°rruri left for Oran on 6 March 1939. Exile Irene Falc√≥n went into exile with Ib√°rruri in Paris and then the USSR. There she worked for the underground Radio Pirenaica. The Falc√≥ns' marriage broke down because C√©sar Falc√≥n could not remain faithful. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) Irene and C√©sar Falc√≥n were separated, and after the war C√©sar returned to Peru. Irene Falc√≥n remained a feminist within the Communist mold. Writing in the Communist magazine Nuestra Bandera in August 1946 Falcon called for women to continue to play their traditional nurturing role, but to also participate in the struggle against Fascism. She wrote, \\"Precisely in the clandestine resistance, women can play and are playing an extremely important role. On the one hand, women who have already played an active part in workers or mass organizations are an important support to their partners and children who choose the heroic path of resistance, the one that helps the guerrilla movements.\\" In August 1946 Falcon became national secretary of the Union of Spanish Women. After the Prague show trial of 1952 eleven Czechoslovakian Communists were executed, including Falc√≥n's former lover Bed≈ôich Geminder, head of the Czech Communist Party's central committee's Department of International Relations. Although her relationship with Geminder had ended in 1945 Falc√≥n was thrown out of the party. She became a persona non grata and lost her job at Radio Pirenaica. She and her sister Kety were banned from working, and her son Mayo was banned from the Soviet Communist Party. Ib√°rruri managed to get her another job, working discreetly to avoid herself getting into trouble. In 1954 Irene Falc√≥n went to Beijing to launch a radio station in Castilian. After a year and a half she returned to the USSR. Irene Falc√≥n returned to Spain from exile in 1977 after the return of democracy. She became director of the Dolores Ib√°rruri Foundation. In 1996 she published her memoirs entitled Asaltar los cielos. Mi vida junto a Pasionaria (Storm the Skies: My Life with Pasionaria). She died on 19 August 1999 in El Espinar, Segovia, from a respiratory condition.

The leaves are long and wide, arranged in alternating opposite pairs (decussate). The flowers are white or cream-coloured and occur singly or in small groups, sometimes at the ends of branches and sometimes in the leaf axils. At the base of each flower there are brown, papery, overlapping bracts. The stamens are arranged in 5 bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 22 to 25 stamens. Flowering occurs from July to October but mostly in September. The fruit are woody capsules long with the sepals remaining as long curved teeth. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca calycina was first formally described in 1812 by Robert Brown in Hortus Kewensis. The specific epithet (calycina) is from the Greek kalyx, calyx, (collectively the sepals).

Early life and education Bessie Ellen Davidson was born on 22 May 1879 in North Adelaide, South Australia, to a family of Scottish and English origin. She was the second child of David Davidson, who was in the mining industry, and Ellen Johnson Davidson. Her great-grandfather William Gowan was a sculptor, and her grandmother Frances Gowan was a painter. She was educated at the Advanced School for Girls (which had a strong drawing strand), and studied art with the painter Rose McPherson (better known as Margaret Preston). She began exhibiting with the South Australian Society of Arts as early as 1901; in this period, her work clearly showed Preston's influence. In 1904, after her mother's death, she went to Europe to study art in company with Preston. They spent the first few months in Munich, where Davidson studied briefly at the K√ºnstlerinner Verein, before moving on to Paris. There she studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, under Ren√©-Xavier Prinet, where she met and began a lifelong friendship with Philippe Besnard's future wife, Germaine Desgranges. She also took classes with Raphael Collin, Richard Miller, and Gustave Courtois. A year after her arrival in France, she was exhibiting at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais, and the year after that at the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. In 1922 she would become the first Australian woman elected a member of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and she would later serve as its secretary. She was a founding member of the Salon des Tuileries, at which she would exhibit almost every year between 1923 and 1951. Career Returning to Australia in 1907, Davidson rented a studio with Preston and continued painting and exhibiting for several years. In 1908, the National Gallery of South Australia bought her portrait of the potter Gladys Reynell. In 1910, she went back to Paris and set up a workshop in Monparnasse on Boissonade Street next door to Raymond Legueult and across the street from the Dutch painter Conrad Kickert. She became the godmother of Kickert's daughter as well as of Philippe Besnard's daughter. She made many other friends in Parisian art circles, including the painter Anders Osterlind. Davidson travelled to Australia to visit family in 1914 and was there when World War I began. She returned to France immediately, where she joined the French Red Cross and served in various military hospitals. During the war, she met the woman who would be her companion for the next two decades, Marguerite Leroy (d. 1938), whose nickname was \\"Dauphine\\". The postwar period between 1918 and 1920 saw Davidson producing quiet, intimate, loosely impressionistic paintings‚Äîmostly interiors, still lives, and portraits‚Äîin muted tones. Her style evolved in a more vigorous direction in the 1920s and 1930s, with rich, vibrant, often dramatic colours laid on with a palette knife. In this period her work sold well and was well received by critics. She travelled around Europe, Russia, and Morocco making outdoor sketches that she used as the basis for paintings later produced in her studio. Her landscapes are notable for their quality of light and sense of atmosphere. In 1930 Davidson was a founding vice-president of La Soci√©t√© Femmes Artistes Modernes. She was a founding member of the Soci√©t√© Nationale Ind√©pendentes and a member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1931 she was appointed to the French Legion of Honor, in part for her cofounding of the Salon des Tuileries, the only Australian woman to receive that honour up to that time. She exhibited widely with such artists as Mary Cassatt, Tamara de Lempicka, Camille Claudel, and Suzanne Valadon. Although still a citizen of the British Commonwealth, Davidson decided to stay in France during World War II. She lived with friends in Grenoble, and some sources say that she was a member of the French Resistance. Her paintings from this period are strong, bright, and lively. In 1945, she returned to her old studio in Paris, occasionally spending time at a farm she bought near Rouen. In the postwar period, she painted mostly outdoors on small wood panels. She died at Montparnasse in France in 1965. She was buried in Saint-Sa√´ns, Seine- Maritime.

His father, Subir Kumar Ghosh, was a professor of geology at Jadavpur University and his mother, Sheila Ghosh (n√©e Sen), is a homemaker. He attended St. Lawrence High School (1971-1981) and South Point High School (1981-1983). As a child, he learned Sanskrit from his grandmother Ila Ghosh (n√©e Roy), a language he still speaks and reads fluently. He obtained a B. Sc. (Honours) in chemistry from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 1987, winning the University Medal of the Faculty of Science. The same year, he moved to the University of Minnesota, where he completed a PhD under the supervision of Regents' Professor Paul G. Gassman in 1992 and subsequently also postdoctoral research with Professor Lawrence Que, Jr. During this period, he also collaborated extensively with Professor Jan Alml√∂f. He did a brief, second postdoc with Professor David Bocian at the University of California Riverside. Career After postdoctoral stints in Minnesota and California, he moved to UiT ‚Äì The Arctic University of Norway in 1996, where he has remained ever since. He has had several secondary positions/affiliations: Senior Fellow of the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California San Diego (1997-2004), Outstanding Younger Researcher awardee of the Research Council of Norway (2004-2010), a co-principal investigator at the national center of excellence Centre for Theoretical and Computational Chemistry (2007-2017), and a Visiting Professor at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, on many occasions (2006-2016). He edited two books, The Smallest Biomolecules: Diatomics and their Interactions with Heme Proteins (Elsevier, 2008), a monograph on the subject, and Letters to a Young Chemist (Wiley, 2011), a popular science book on careers in chemistry research.\\"What's it like to be a chemist?\\". Royal Society of Chemistry Website. review by Simon Cotton In 2014, he coauthored Arrow Pushing in Inorganic Chemistry: A Logical Approach to the Chemistry of the Main Group Elements (Wiley) with Steffen Berg, which won the 2015 Prose Award for 'best textbook in the Physical Sciences and Mathematics'. He has served on the editorial advisory board of the Journal of Biological Inorganic Chemistry (1999‚Äì2001, 2005‚Äì2007) and currently serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Porphyrins and Phthalocyanines (2000‚Äì) and Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry (2007‚Äìpresent). As of 2020, he has authored/coauthored over 230 scientific papers, which have been cited nearly 10,000 times with an h-index of approximately 56. Research Dr. Ghosh has contributed to many areas of porphyrin-related research. His early contributions include the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study short-strong hydrogen bonds in porphyrin-type molecules and also some of the first large-scale ab initio calculations applied to porphyrins and other bioinorganic systems. He has had an abiding interest in the phenomenon of ligand noninnocence and has contributed substantially to studying the phenomenon in transition metal nitrosyl and corrole derivatives. In recent years, he has developed the field of heavy element corrole derivatives, which are unusual size-mismatched metal-ligand assemblies that incorporate a large 4d or 5d transition metal ion within the sterically compressed central cavity of a corrole. In this area he has reported some of the first examples of 99Tc, rhenium, osmium, platinum, and gold corroles. Despite their size-mismatched character, many of these complexes have proved rugged and found applications as near-IR phosphorescent photosensitizers in oxygen sensing and photodynamic therapy as well as in dye-sensitized solar cells. In collaboration with linguist Paul Kiparsky, Ghosh has recently written about the possible influence of PƒÅ·πáini's Sanskrit grammar, in particular the periodic Sanskrit alphabet (the Shiva sutras), on Mendeleev's conception of the periodic table, a potentially important, new insight into the history of the periodic table.

It relies on a new entry system designed by Saied B. Nesbat, formatted as a 3x3 matrix keypad where users may press or swipe up, down, left, right, or diagonally to access all keys and symbols. It is a keyboard that was designed for devices like cell phones, mimicking the early cell phones' limited number of 12 keys. The most common letters (the large letters in the illustration below) are accessed by a tap. Less common letters are accessed by a slide. Example: Tapping the center square generates an 'o'. Sliding to the left from the same square generates a 'c'. A green trail shows the path of the finger. The keyboard supports multiple user dictionaries, used for word prediction and correction. The software is developed and patented by ExIdeas, based in Belmont, California. It was first released in 2002 for the Palm, along with a paper in 2003. Layout Default keyboard The keyboard layout has a 3x3 matrix that allows for full-text entry. The letter placement is optimized for minimal movement distance between letters, allowing for faster typing. The layout is 67% faster than a standard QWERTY software keyboard, and 31% faster than a multi-tap keyboard, when typing is modeled with Fitt's law. One touch keys The 9 most frequent letters in English texts: ETAONRISH, are placed on the keyboard so they can be accessed on a single click. One move keys The next 17 less frequent letters: DLFCMUGYPWBVKJXQZ, are placed as to be triggered by a single move of the finger from or to the central key (O) (except for Z which is centered around the 'E' key together with some punctuation characters). For example, the letter V is typed by dragging the finger from A to O, and the letter D by moving from O to E. Special characters The moves producing special characters, which includes 38 characters including accents and punctuation marks, are displayed on a complete keyboard showing up when the user drags the space bar upwards. This is not an alternate keyboard in the sense that the key pair moves are valid on both keyboard. It is rather a mnemonic help, which is normally hidden to avoid overwhelming the user with spurious information. Control keys A small vertical bar on the right (or on the left in left- handed mode) gives direct access to the cut/copy/paste operations, the numeric keypad, the uppercase/lowercase control, as well the usual F1-F12 control keys.

It was also originally a competitor to the T9 predictive input method, on a 12-button phone, with 9 number buttons. In this first iteration, each of the 9 primary characters needed to be pressed twice in a row, and secondary characters were entered by first pressing the main button, and then pressing one of the remaining 8 buttons. In this first iteration, because many letters required two presses, it was not significantly faster than the Multi-tap input method. MessagEase is now exclusively for touch screens, and no longer has physical 12-button support. All characters are now entered by tapping or swiping.

It has been caused by damage to the cerebrum or rewiring of the brain.  Characteristics  An individual with this condition has an especially difficult time maintaining a steady beat, and even has difficulty following along to a steady rhythm. Before it was a known disorder, it was thought that these individuals were just severely uncoordinated, and therefore were unable to follow along with the music. It has been discovered recently that problems with rhythm in schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are also found to have a correlation to rhythm deficiencies.  Neurological bases of music  The cerebellum houses the center for fine motor skills. These are needed in order to play the instrument. The temporal lobe and the frontal lobe are necessary for listening and recalling different musical aspects from lyrics, reading the music, and performing. Memory centers are primarily located in the hippocampus, and the process of listening to music originates there. Neuroplasticity allows the brain to grow and change, especially in the auditory and motor cortex. Listening and playing music helps both of these areas of the brain to develop more, which was found to be correlated to having an improves auditory imagery in many performers in a study conducted at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.  Similar diagnoses  Auditory arrhythmia can also be confused with something called beat deafness. Beat deafness is a form of congenital amusia, which is a person's inability to move in time to the music, or feel a musical rhythm. It is believed by researchers that beat deafness stems from a connection problem between the brain's auditory cortex and inferior frontal lobe. A postdoctoral researcher with the International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research at the University of Montreal studied a case where a man could not feel a rhythm in any sense. Not only did he have difficulty dancing, but he was unable to tap his foot or snap his fingers along with the beat of the music. The major difference between beat deafness and auditory arrhythmia, however, is that beat deafness is most likely something you are born with, whereas the arrhythmia most likely comes from damage, which was the case in the research done on \\"Mathieu,\\" the first known case of beat-deafness. In another case, a former musician known as H.J. suffered damage from a temporoparietal infarct, which is an area of dead tissue due to lack of adequate blood supply. The infarct was believed to have been caused by a problem during a coronary angiography, which is a test to show the insides of an individual's coronary arteries. H.J. suffered difficulties with creating a steady beat, an inability to distinguish between different sets of rhythms, and also experienced difficulties when playing his instruments.  Rhythmic problems in animals other than humans  Research was conducted on birds such as the Zebra Finch because this species has parallels to humans' vocal learning patterns and neurological structures. Adult zebra finches were placed in similar conditions, all exposed to nine rhythmic and nine arrhythmic songs for 30 second increments. After the stimulus was presented, the brains were studied for areas of high ZENK concentration, ZENK being an immunohistochemical used to detect neural activation. It was found in the finches that those exposed to the arrhythmic music had much higher levels of the ZENK gene, and it has been discovered that there is a correlation with humans having higher brain activity in these locations with arrhythmic functioning. Gaining an understanding of how to change the deficiencies in these animals can help lead to changes in the future for humans with auditory arrhythmia and other serious psychiatric disorders.  Auditory processing in those with autism  Those diagnosed with autism tend to have many difficulties processing auditory stimuli. For example, they most often endure language and speech delays, hyperacusis, have difficulties communicating in large social groups, and may experience difficulties hearing certain voices in a noisy environment. These qualities make quality of life difficult, by inhibiting their ability to fully participate in social and educational circumstances in various parts of their lives. As shown in research published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology, efferent pathways throughout the brain help to control various functions throughout the body. For example, in those with autism, pathways running through to the middle ear muscles make it difficult for the person to focus on a single voice when there is a lot of background noise. Raising eyelids was also found to hinder the stapedius muscle by tensing it, which in turn makes it difficult for these individuals to hear other talking when there is background noise present. The laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles located in the throat make prosody and intonation difficult to understand for people with autism. During research, tasks and tests were conducted to see if there is a correlation between cardiac rhythms, respiratory sinus arrhythmias, and auditory processing, or auditory arrhythmia. Because these symptoms tend to go hand in hand, researchers were looking to see if there was a possibility of improving auditory processing. If researchers learn how to effectively improve auditory sensations in people diagnose with autism, then there is a possibility that they can then begin finding the improvement for those only suffering from auditory arrhythmia.  Recent research  The Easter Seals Metropolitan Chicago Therapeutic School and Center for Autism Research has conducted studies on auditory processing in individuals with autism. The International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research at the University of Montreal has found that beat and tone deafness are likely genetic, and believe that it is because of a miswiring between the auditory cortex and inferior frontal cortex. They were also major researchers on Mathieu's case of beat deafness. Studies conducted at Utrecht University in the Netherlands show that there is an association with an improves ability for auditory imagery and music. McGill University also studied Mathieu's case, along with another individual known as Marjorie. The studies conducted show that true beat deafness is an extremely rare disorder, because out of all the individuals who applied thinking they were beat deaf, Marjorie and Mathieu were the only two. H.J.'s case has been studied in Victoria, Australia at the University of Melbourne and La Trobe University. The data collected caused researchers to believe that the right temporal auditory cortex plays a large role in an individual's ability to maintain a steady rhythm, and has provided a platform for future neuropsychological research.

His former wife, Pamela Anne Phillips, a one-time model, real estate agent and socialite, was charged with orchestrating her ex-husband's death. In a sensational trial nearly 18 years after Triano's murder, Phillips was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Phillips, who is now incarcerated at the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville, claims that Triano's death was a mob revenge killing. Ronald Young, who was hired by Phillips as a hit man, also was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Background Gary Triano was a longtime Tucson, Arizona resident. He graduated from Rincon High School and earned a degree in accounting from the University of Arizona. He also attended the University of Arizona's law school. He married Mary Cram, and they had two children, Heather and Brian. Triano married his second wife, Pamela Phillips, on October 4, 1986 in San Diego, California. During their marriage, the couple had two children, Trevor and Lois, before their bitter divorce in 1993. At the time of the divorce, Triano filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming $40 million in debt after several failed business dealings regarding Indian casinos. Phillips moved to Aspen, Colorado with the couple's two children, where she continued her career in commercial real estate. Murder On November 1, 1996, Gary Triano was killed when a pipe bomb exploded in his car at the La Paloma Country Club in Catalina Foothills, Arizona. Within weeks, the investigation centered around his ex-wife Pamela Phillips, who was still living in Aspen. It was discovered that she had taken out a $2 million life insurance policy against Triano shortly before his death. The couple's two children were the beneficiaries of the policy, which was paid out to Phillips in 1997. Evidence also linked Phillips to Ronald Young, a small-time criminal with whom Phillips developed a relationship while in Aspen. Shortly before the bombing, a van rented by Young was found abandoned in Yorba Linda, California, and inside the vehicle there were documents pertaining to Phillips and Triano's divorce, a map of Tucson, Arizona, and a sawed-off shotgun. Nine years after the murder, on November 19, 2005, an episode of America's Most Wanted profiled Ronald Young, who was then wanted for forgery and embezzlement. The episode also mentioned his suspected involvement in Triano's death. Two days later, Young was apprehended in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He served a 10-month sentence in federal prison for weapon possession before being extradited back to Aspen. Following Young's arrest, investigators found records of phone calls and email correspondence between Young and Phillips related to Triano's murder. In 2008, Ronald Young was charged with the murder of Gary Triano. On December 3, 2009, Pamela Phillips was also arrested for Triano's murder in Vienna, Austria, when she fled after her indictment in October 2008. She was later returned to the United States to stand trial. Trials Ronald Young went to trial for Gary Triano's murder in 2010. Prosecutors showed records that Phillips agreed to give Young $400,000 to kill her ex-husband. Also introduced into evidence were the tapes and recordings outlining the conspiracy. At the conclusion of his trial, Young was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He was sentenced to two life terms. Following her extradition to Arizona to stand trial, Pamela Phillips was held on $5 million bond at the Pima County Jail. In December 2011, she was initially ruled mentally incompetent for trial. In October 2012, she was ruled competent to stand trial after undergoing treatment at the jail. Phillips' trial began in 2014 and lasted for seven weeks. Prosecutors used similar evidence in her trial that was used to convict Young. Phillips was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy. Like Young, she was also sentenced to life in prison; she has no possibility for parole. In the media The murder of Gary Triano has been televised on several programs, including Dateline NBC, Dateline on ID, 48 Hours, Snapped, American Greed (2015 episode \\"A Widow's Web\\") and Fatal Vows. In January 2012, the case was a subject of a true crime book by Kerie Droban.

Rather than focusing on one group of students who traditionally struggle, or who traditionally succeed, social justice leaders address the learning needs of all students. Social justice educational leadership specifically addresses how differences in race, income, language, ability, gender, and sexual orientation influence the design and effectiveness of learning environments. Social justice leadership draws from inclusive education practices from disability education, but extends the concepts further to support students from diverse groups with a wide range of needs. Through restructuring staff allocation and assessing student progress through disaggregated data, school leaders strive to create schools with equal access and equitable support for all students. Goals Social justice educational leaders recognize the role race, ethnicity, family income, ability, gender, and sexual orientation play in predicting student success in school. They commit to creating schools that address societal inequalities by striving to help all students reach academic proficiency. As described by Scheurich and Skrla, \\"In striving for both equity and excellence... we are aiming for schools in which there are no persistent patterns of differences in academic success or treatment among students grouped by race, ethnicity, culture, neighborhood, income of parents, or home language. In other words, we are aiming to foster schools that literally serve each and every student really well.\\" (pg. 2). In order to assess whether these patterns of difference exist, social justice leaders use data tools, such as equity audits, to uncover structures that create differences in student learning outcomes. Equity audits use data such as standardized test scores, discipline rates, family involvement in schools, advanced course participation, special education labeling, at-risk identification, and intervention placement to create profiles of achievement for different student groups in the school. Equity audits reveal achievement gap trends in these areas, in which traditionally marginalized students frequently perform at lower levels than their more privileged peers. Many schools find demographically similar groups of students struggling in academics, language, discipline, graduation rates, and other markers of student success. Once these patterns are identified, social justice leaders equip staff and students with the skills necessary to address discrepancies in student learning needs. Student services Social justice leadership builds on concepts of inclusive education, in which services are brought to students in the general classroom environment, rather than pulling students out to a resource room. However, social justice leadership diverges somewhat from inclusive education in that full inclusion at all times is not required. Social justice leaders focus on providing services in classrooms and other flexible spaces that can be accessed by all students, rather than removing students to receive special support in separate classrooms. Social justice leadership also emphasizes assigning students to classrooms and groups using proportional representation. This means that the proportion of students in any classroom or group should match the natural proportion of students from all demographic groups in the school. For example, if 15% of the student body is Latino, then 15% of every classroom should be Latino, only 15% of students who qualify for special education should be Latino and only 15% of students receiving discipline should be Latino. This method of bringing services to students in general education environments with proportional representation also differs from pull-out models like response to intervention (RtI). Many pull-out models identify students struggling in the classroom and assign them to interventions led by educator specialists outside the general education classroom, rather than by their classroom teachers. For students with more significant needs, pull-out interventions may be from several staff, such as from the Title I teacher, reading interventionist, speech therapist, and social worker, introducing multiple adults and environments to students who would most benefit from consistency. This practice locates the responsibility for educating students with additional needs with the interventionist, rather than the classroom teacher, reducing their efficacy.  Behavior Management  Many school behavior management efforts criminalize small infractions, and maintain a focus on retribution rather than restoration. This, combined with institutional and individual bias, results in a significant overrepresentation of students of color in suspension and expulsion rates. Advocates of social justice in schools purport that exclusionary discipline practices such as suspension and expulsion actively remove students from their school communities and exacerbate feelings of isolation and resentment. Zero tolerance policies, popularized in the 1990s, have been shown to be ineffective on multiple measures, leaving school leaders looking for alternative strategies to promote safe and orderly learning environments. School leaders focused on social justice are additionally compelled to find strategies that disrupt persisting inequities. This is where restorative justice practices, culturally and linguistically responsive practices (CLRP) and Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) come into play as approaches aiming to address both institutional inequities and the need for safe learning environments.  CLR-PBIS  PBIS comes with a variety of acronyms. Some schools cut out the ‚Äúintervention‚Äù part, going with the proactive-only PBS system. PBIS is more akin to the three-tiered Response to Intervention system. Others add in the necessity of schoolwide (SW) implementation, dubbing the program SWPBIS. Whatever variation is used (here, PBIS), the primary practices included in the system are listed below. PBIS has shown promise in reducing exclusionary discipline practices overall, but has not shown, on its own, to be effective at reducing the racial disparities in student discipline, and in some cases has even been shown to exacerbate the discrepancies by further reducing discipline referrals for White students, but not for students of color. These criticisms have led to a call for examination of PBIS, and the integration of CLRP with PBIS in order to address systemic inequities in school discipline. CLRP has its roots in the work of Gloria Ladson-Billings surrounding culturally relevant pedagogy. Reflecting on this initial thinking, Ladson-Billings more recently stated: > By focusing on student learning and academic achievement versus classroom > and behavior management, cultural competence versus cultural assimilation or > eradication, and sociopolitical consciousness rather than school-based tasks > that have no beyond-school application, I was able to see students take both > responsibility for and deep interest in their education. This is the secret > behind culturally relevant pedagogy: the ability to link principles of > learning with deep understanding of (and appreciation for) culture. Other scholars have echoed and built upon this work, giving linguistic relevance footing in the literature, proposing specific practices that may help teachers improve pedagogical relevance, and considering how to best integrate PBIS and CLRP. = Key Features of PBIS = * Clearly defining behavioral expectations valued by the school community. * Proactively teaching what those expected behaviors look like in various school settings at least once a year. * Frequently rewarding students who comply with behavioral expectations. * Administering a clearly defined continuum of consequences for behavioral violations. * Continuously collecting and analyzing data to assess students‚Äô responsiveness to the behavioral support provided.  Restorative Justice  Thalia Gonz√°lez describes restorative justice in schools as ‚Äúan approach to discipline that engages all parties in a balanced practice that brings together all people impacted by an issue or behavior.‚Äù Heather Alexander details the roots of these practices, stating, ‚ÄúThe principles of restorative justice are consistent with many indigenous traditions, including Canadian First Nations people and the Maori in New Zealand.‚Äù She also links restorative justice to ‚Äúentangled roots in native, religious, and legal communities.‚Äù Alexander and Gonz√°lez have studied how the underpinnings of various cultural, religious, and judicial practices have made their way into the philosophy and practice of restorative justice. Multiple scholars advocate for restorative practices as an alternative to exclusionary approaches to discipline, both in schools and in the criminal justice system. Many different practices (including, but not limited to: circles, mediation, conferencing, and youth courts) are labeled as restorative justice. Trevor Fronius, et. al describe restorative justice as ‚Äúa broad term that encompasses a growing social movement to institutionalize peaceful and non-punitive approaches for addressing harm, responding to violations of legal and human rights, and problem solving.‚Äù This definition speaks to restorative justice as more of a collection of practices rooted in a common philosophy than a specific ‚Äúprogram.‚Äù Fronius, et. al go on to say that ‚Äúthe emphasis on the harm done rather than the act is a widely recognized principle across the RJ literature.‚Äù and they speak to Dorothy Vaandering‚Äôs work surrounding ‚Äúhow to use shame as a path toward reintegration rather than stigmatization.\\" Key Principles of Restorative Justice * Repairing Harm, * Involving Stakeholders * Transforming Community Relationships Staff allocation Both inclusive and pull-out models seek to reduce the student to teacher ratio, but inclusive models do so by bringing services and staff expertise to students. Thus, social justice leaders need to strategically plan how to effectively allocate their limited staff resources. Rather than having several specialists who work with students with specific needs, leaders structure collaborative teams of classroom teachers, cross-categorical special education teachers, and bilingual resource teachers to support classrooms of students. Critiques Social justice educational leadership has been critiqued in several ways. Some feel social justice leadership reinforces the categorization of students, even though the approach emphasizes reducing unnecessary student labeling. The data equity audits focus mostly on identifying inequitable learning outcomes, but few solutions and strategies are suggested for improving these outcomes. By identifying the classroom teacher as responsible for ensuring all students reach proficiency, many teachers feel unsupported in the work and struggle to adequately differentiate lessons for their students. Finally, social justice educational leadership emphasizes proficiency as measured by standardized test scores, which limits the space for innovation and teaching that builds higher- order thinking, which is difficult to measure on standardized tests.

Although Hebrew-speaking RMs often use the term Anusim to describe themselves, RMs in the diaspora more commonly self-identify as RM. The term highlights the opposite nature of their secrecy as compared to Spanish Jewish marranos in the Middle Ages, who were forced to publicly abandon their Judaism while secretly maintaining their Jewish customs. Since the advent of the Internet, RMs tend to converse and support each other online within social media groups and on web-based forums. Because of the secrecy inherent in maintaining an RM lifestyle, the number of RMs individuals is difficult to gauge, and estimates range from several hundred to several thousand worldwide. Many young Jewish teens are RMs as they keep their disbelief to themselves, and stay in their parents care.

Gruessner (born 1957) is a German-born American general surgeon and transplant surgeon, most noted as a surgical pioneer for his clinical and research innovations. Gruessner was the first transplant surgeon to perform all types of abdominal transplants (kidney, liver, pancreas and intestine) from living donors. He was also the first surgeon to describe a standardized technique for intestinal (bowel) transplantation from a living donor and then performed it successfully in 1997. He was the first surgeon to perform a combined laparoscopic removal of a portion of the pancreas and a kidney that were successfully transplanted simultaneously into a diabetic patient with end-stage renal disease. In 1998, Gruessner performed the first preemptive liver transplant from a living donor in an infant with oxalosis. In 2012, he and his team performed the first fully robotic removal of the pancreas and simultaneous islet transplant in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. Gruessner was a member of the team that performed the world's first split pancreas transplant and the world's first pancreas allotransplant after complete removal of a patient's native pancreas (both in 1988). He was involved in the development of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) techniques and conducted the first prospective study in 1989 that demonstrated the superiority of ultrasound in comparison to peritoneal lavage in the diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma. In the 1990s, he was the first to confirm in large clinical studies the efficacy of new immunosuppressive drugs after pancreas transplantation. Gruessner's basic-science research has focused on different techniques of donor cell augmentation for tolerance induction after transplantation and on different rejection patterns in single versus combined transplants. In 2015, he and his team showed that 25 years of organ transplantation in the U.S. saved 2.2 million years of life in patients with end-stage organ failure. Biography and career Gruessner was born in 1957 in Mainz, Germany and completed medical school at the Johannes Gutenberg University. In 1983, he was awarded ‚Äúsumma cum laude‚Äù for his doctoral thesis. After his residency, he completed a fellowship in transplantation immunology at the University of Minnesota. In 1991, Gruessner completed his professorial thesis (‚ÄúHabilitation‚Äù, the German Ph.D. equivalent) at Philipps University of Marburg in Marburg, Germany. In 1991, Gruessner began his academic career in the U.S. as an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Minnesota. Five years later, he was promoted to full professor with tenure. Gruessner returned to Europe for one year to become Chairman of the Department of General and Transplant Surgery at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1999, Gruessner returned to the U.S. to assume the roles of Vice-Chair of the Department of Surgery and Vice Chief of the Division of Transplantation at the University of Minnesota. While in Minnesota, he and his team performed the state's first living donor liver transplant, first living donor intestinal transplant, first combined living donor intestinal and liver transplant, and first multivisceral transplant. His focus on living donor transplantation was boosted in 1996 when he received additional training in living donor transplantation at the University of Kyoto in Kyoto, Japan. In 2007, Gruessner was appointed Chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Arizona. He also served as the department's Chief of Transplantation and Surgical Director of the Hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) Program at the University of Arizona. During his tenure, he transformed a struggling department into one with a national reputation specifically in transplantation and robotic as well as minimally invasive surgery. To achieve this, Gruessner recruited over 50 new faculty, developed numerous new programs and divisions, and quadrupled of the department's NIH support. As Chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Arizona, Gruessner oversaw the surgical management for the victims of the 2011 Tucson shooting. The patients included former US Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who suffered a critical gunshot wound to the head. While in Arizona, Gruessner performed the state's first living and deceased intestinal transplants, first multivisceral transplant, first pediatric living donor liver transplant and first autologous islet transplant. In 2015, Gruessner joined the State University of New York (SUNY). At SUNY-Upstate in Syracuse, he substantially expanded its transplant program. In 2017, he was appointed the Clarence Dennis Professor and Chairman of the Department of Surgery at SUNY-Downstate in Brooklyn. There, he performed the first kidney after intestinal transplant from two different living donors and described the use of continuous real-time ultrasonography and Doppler study during islet infusion into the liver. Honors and scholarly achievements Gruessner has edited three standard textbooks including Transplantation of the Pancreas and Living Donor Organ Transplantation. He has authored or co-authored more than 300 peer-reviewed publications and over 100 book chapters. He sits on various editorial boards of surgical and transplant journals and has served on many national committees and professional societies. Gruessner received the Innovation Award of the University of Arizona in 2009, the Diabetes Cure Award of the American Diabetes Association (Arizona chapter) in 2012, and an honorary fellowship of the European Board of Transplantation in 2013. He also serves as the Medical Director of the International Pancreas Transplant Registry (IPTR), which collects data on all pancreas transplants performed in diabetic patients worldwide. In 2019, Angelika Gruessner, PhD., and he received the Richard C. Lillehei Award by the International Pancreas and Islet Transplantation Society in Lyon, France. This is the most eminent award in the field of pancreas transplantation and transplantation of diabetic patients. Gruessner has mentored numerous transplant fellows, surgical residents and medical students. Throughout his career, Gruessner has been a vocal promoter and advocate of organ donation and transplantation.

Eisenberg is a professor at The University of Pennsylvania and a member of the University's School of Veterinary Medicine and School of Dental Medicine. The majority of Eisenberg's research is focused on the herpes simplex virus and the poxvirus and how they enter into susceptible cells. She also studies glycoproteins, vaccines, virology and microbiology. Education Eisenberg graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1960 with her applied baccalaureate degree in biology. She went on to obtain her Ph.D in microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, where she now works. Dr. Eisenberg did her post-doctoral fellowship at Princeton University from 1965 to 1968. She works closely beside Dr. Gary H. Cohen, who is a professor and the chair of the Department of Microbiology at Penn Dental Medicine. Research contributions Eisenberg studies how molecular events mediate a virus' entry into a cell. Her research is focused mainly on the herpes simplex virus (herpesviridea) and the poxvirus. Herpesvirus She is primarily interested in studying herpesviridae, which consists of enveloped DNA viruses that recruit orthologs, or genes that retain the same function, of three glycoproteins. These glycoproteins gB, gH, and gL play important roles in how a virus enters a cell and how it spreads when inside of a cell. Eisenberg is interested in the fact that glycoproteins gH, gL and gB are very protected in all herpesviruses, especially in the large number of animal herpesviruses, which can cause disease in small, farm, and zoo animals. Herpes simplex virus pap test 2 Poxvirus She is also very focused on studying the poxvirus variola, also known as smallpox, and the virus that is used as a vaccine against variola, called vaccina. Her main goal is to understand how this virus enters a cell and also to come up with a subunit vaccine that will expand upon and improve the current vaccine for variola, which can have serious side effects and may not be used on pregnant women or individuals with an impaired immune system. She is directing her focus to the entry protein L1, which she believes is the receptor binding protein for vaccina and will be able to improve limitations of the current vaccine for smallpox.

In order to be near the best puritan pulpits he settled in Moorgate, and soon became known for his tracts supporting the general view that this world was the hell of the godly and the next world the hell of the ungodly, but more particularly admonishing in no measured terms the errors of the drunkard, the swearer, and the covetous. In his \\"Curb against Cursing\\" he commends above his own writing the \\"Heaven and Hell Epitomised\\" of George Swinnock; but he went on steadily down to 1671 pouring out penny tracts. Most of them were issued through James Crump, a bookbinder in Little Bartholomew's Well-yard. Many copies were exported to America, while others were either lent on a twopenny security or given away by the author, first at the Black Swan, Moorgate, and afterwards in Cripplegate and Newington Causeway. Works His publications comprised: *\\"A Counterpoyson, or Soverain Antidote against all Griefe ‚Ä¶ together with the Victory of Patience\\", London, 1637, 8vo; a second edition, much enlarged, and recommended by Thomas Westfield and Daniel Featley, appeared in 1641; a \\"fourth edition\\" was included in \\"A Christian Library\\", mentioned below. *\\"Philarguromastix, or the Arraignment of Covetousnesse and Ambition in our great and greedy Cormorants. ‚Ä¶ By Junius Florilegus\\", London, 1653, 8vo. He frequently signed himself \\"Richard Young, of Roxwell, Florilegus\\". *\\"The Blemish of Government, Shame of Religion, Disgrace of Mankinde, or a Charge drawn up against Drunkards, and presented to his Highness the Lord Protector in the name of all the Sober partie in the three Nations\\", London, 1655, 8vo. *\\"A Christian Library, or a Pleasant and Plentiful Paradise of Practical Divinity\\", London, 1665, 8vo. This bulky volume is stated to contain ten treatises, \\"like ten small Cornfields now laid together (as it were) within one hedge\\", prefaced by letters to the \\"Worthy Authour\\" and \\"Ingenuous Reader\\" by Richard Vines and Richard Baxter. With the original ten are bound up in the British Museum copy eleven additional treatises by Young, all of them apparently being remainder copies of penny tracts by Young in various editions. At the end of a tract called \\"Apples of Gold\\" (1654) the printer gives a list of thirty-three separately printed discourses by Young. *\\"The Peoples Impartial and Compassionate Monitor, about hearing of Sermons\\", 1657; an attack upon preaching for rhetorical effect merely, dedicated to Sir Nathanael Basile. *\\"The Impartial Monitor: about Following the Fashions ‚Ä¶ in a rare Example of one that Cured his Wife of her Costlinesse. Imprimatur, Edmund Calamie\\", London, 1656. *\\"The Hearts-Index, or Self-Knowledge\\", 1659. *\\"A Hopefull Way to Cure that horrid Sinne of Swearing\\", 1660. *\\"Mens great losse of Happinesse for not paying the small quit-rent of Thankfulnesse\\", 1661. *\\"A Spark of Divine Light to kindle piety in a frozen Soul ‚Ä¶ printed for Peter Parker in Popes-head Alley\\", 1671. This little piece, which he calls his \\"little Benjamin\\", was apparently the last of Young's exhortatories. In a postscript he announces \\"Upon Newington Causeway this Book is freely given to all, but beware of sending for it out of wantonness; for sacrilege is a parching and a blasting sin\\". The British Museum Library has nearly thirty of Young's admonitory tracts and other works; but it is hard to differentiate them, owing to the variations of title in successive editions.

In 2015, having performed as an Adele impersonator on the drag scene in London, Adams was asked to join several other Adele impersonators for a show the BBC were doing about impersonators. During the recording Adams walked out, saying ‚ÄúI thought it was going to be this reality show.\\" She missed out on an opportunity to meet Adele during a prank set up by the BBC and Graham Norton for Adele at the BBC because she didn't trust the producers' motives. She is a supporter of the LGBT community and works closely with drag performer Jonny Woo. Having started her live performance career at drag bars such as the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, Jayde often cites the LGBT community in London as the reason she found confidence after the death of her sister in 2011. In March 2018, alongside Melanie Blatt, Nicole Appleton and Shaznay Lewis from the All Saints, Jaime Winstone, John Sizzle and British fashion designer Gareth Pugh, Adams was a judge on Miss Sink The Pink 2018, an annual drag queen talent competition held at The Roundhouse in Camden.

It is currently the headquarters of the conservation charity, the Bath Preservation Trust, and also operates as a public \\"historic house\\" museum displaying authentic room sets, furniture, pictures and other items illustrating Georgian domestic life both 'above stairs' and 'below stairs'. The house was the subject of a major renovation project during 2012 and 2013 (The Whole Story Project) which reunited No. 1 with its original service wing at No. 1A, from which it had been separated during the 20th century. History The completion of the building work in 1769; No. 1 is shown at the right-end. No. 1 stands as the cornerstone of one of the Royal Crescent, built by John Wood, the Younger between 1767 and 1774: one of the most significant urban architectural achievements of the 18th century. No. 1 is one of the UK's most important buildings, representing the highest point of Palladian architecture in Bath. It has a symmetrical five-window front with a central Doric doorcase. The first tenant was Thomas Brock in 1769 and then in 1776 Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Henry Sandford, a retired Irish Member of Parliament, was the first permanent resident and lived at the house with his family from 1777 until his death in Bath in 1796.http://no1royalcrescent.org.uk/history/henry-sandford/ No. 1 Royal Crescent is a historic house museum, with most of the rooms furnished to represent life in one of the great houses of 18th century Bath. It is owned and maintained by the Bath Preservation Trust through funds provided by memberships and donors to illustrate how wealthy owners of the late 18th century might have lived in such a house. No. 1 was purchased in 1967 by Major Bernard Cayzer, a member of the family associated with the Clan shipping line. He donated the house to the Bath Preservation Trust together with an endowment towards its restoration and furnishing. During 2012 and 2013 the Trust worked to re-unite No. 1 with its original servants' wing at No. 1A Royal Crescent, part of which had once been occupied by the Victorian literary critic George Saintsbury and which had been in use as an entirely separate dwelling since the 1960s. Restoration 1A Royal Crescent is the smaller building to the right, which has been re-united with 1 Royal Crescent, and now forms part of the museum. During the twentieth century the lease on No. 1 Royal Crescent was split and the building was divided into two separate properties, with the original service wing to the east being sold off as No. 1A Royal Crescent. In 2006, No. 1A Royal Crescent was purchased by the Brownsword Charitable Foundation with the intention that it should be reunited with No. 1, thereby allowing Bath Preservation Trust to return the house as far as possible to its original architectural state and to extend its operation as an historic house museum with improved educational and visitor facilities and an additional dedicated exhibition space. With further substantial support from the Heritage Lottery Fund as well as other generous private donations and grants, the major works began in January 2012. Externally, the Venetian windows on the eastern Upper Church Street facade were restored to how they would have appeared when Jane Austen and her contemporaries strolled by in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the door to No. 1A was re-opened in its original site. Internally, the number of Georgian dressed rooms was increased from five to ten, the original kitchens were located and restored, a learning centre for school groups was created, an exhibition gallery was opened and a new shop was installed. Disabled access has been provided in the form of a lift. The museum reopened to the public in June 2013 at a ceremony where Mary Berry cut the ribbon. During the project the Commonplace Books (journals/scrapbooks) of the house's first long-term resident (retired Irish MP Mr Henry Sandford) were unearthed in an Irish library, and these were used to reinterpret the house, showing his story and interests. This gives visitors a truly immersive experience of 18th century life, with a sumptuous meal laid on the dining table, the lady's and gentleman's two bedrooms set out ready for their occupants, the drawing room sparkling with mirrors, and the kitchens laid out as if the servants are busy preparing meals. Portraits in the museum include those of Alexander Pope, Ralph Allen, Field Marshall George Wade, John Vivian of Claverton and Thomas Betterton amongst others.Art UK Bath Preservation Trust headquarters The Bath Preservation Trust has offices on the upper floors of No. 1 Royal Crescent.

The earliest residential development came in the form of log houses, many of which were replaced by stately Victorian and Queen Anne homes in the 1880s and 1890s. In the early 20th century, many homes with Eastlake details were constructed. Beginning in the 1920s, many bungalows were built. After the 1930s, most houses built were more spartan, however some notable Jacobethan Revival are represented.

It was recognized as a distinct disease entity in the 2008 WHO classification. PCFCL had been previously conceived as a variant of follicular lymphoma (FL). Cause Unlike FL, PCFCL is not typically associated with t(14;18) translocation although presence of that translocation does not exclude PCFCL. It is usually not associated with overexpressed Bcl-2. PCFCL represents about 55% to 60% of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCL); primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell cell lymphoma, leg type are the other primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas. The cause of PCFCL is unknown. Diagnosis Treatment Surgical removal and/or radiotherapy is given for localized disease. Radiation using multiple radiation fields is given if the disease has wider extent with grouped lesions. For the less common situation of more extensive disease (still confined to skin), rituximab without chemotherapy is used.

Biography Camil van Hulse's father, Gustaaf van Hulse, was composer and organist of the deanery church of St. Nicholas. His mother, Mary Pelagia Coppens, was a gifted pianist and singer. At age six, Camil got his first musical education in piano and music theory, and later in harmony and counterpoint, from his father, a disciple of Edgar Tinel. By the age of twelve, he was able to play the organ, lead a choir, and sing Gregorian chant from attending church services with his father. From then on, he regularly substituted for his father as organist and conductor. Van Hulse attended school in Sint-Niklaas at the St. Joseph Institute and then studied Greek and Latin at the St. Joseph Minor Seminary, a Roman Catholic college which provided basic training for the priesthood. He followed this course until the first quarter of his third year, after which he devoted himself entirely to music. In addition to his passion for music, he also loved to read. He kept in touch with his former teachers and old college friends. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, van Hulse joined the military at the age of seventeen. During the war, he suffered exposure to poison gas and was told that he had six months to live. He also suffered from tuberculosis. In 1919, he began study at the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp despite his poor health. He studied with Edward Verheyden (harmony and composition), Frans Lenaert (piano), Constant Lenaert (chamber music), and Lodewijk Mortelmans (counterpoint). That same year, he succeeded his father as organist at St. Nicholas Church in Sint-Niklaas. In 1922, he was awarded the prize for harmony with highest distinction and the Royal Medal, as well as the Albert De Vleeschouwer prize. In 1923 he was awarded the highest distinction for piano and the Royal Medal. After graduating, van Hulse's first concern was his health. His doctor told him that he would benefit from a warm and dry climate. Therefore, he moved to Oklahoma in September 1923 and then to Tucson, Arizona, at that time one of the most musical cities in America. Tucson is also known for its favorable climate for pulmonary patients. After spending a summer in Tucson, where the temperature is close to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, he felt much better and decided to stay there. During that time he also changed the spelling of his name from Kamiel to Camil. In 1924, he married Augusta Nijs, a woman to whom he had already been engaged in Belgium. They had two children, Lesghinka and Aziad√©. For van Hulse, the musical life of Tucson was of great importance. He gave private lessons in piano, organ, harmony, and counterpoint. In 1924 he was given a permanent position as organist at All Saints Church, and later he became organist and choirmaster of Ss. Peter and Paul Church. He was the founding conductor of the Tucson Symphony Orchestra. He combined this work with a busy career as a concert pianist. As a composer, he published 130 works. He composed music in all major genres except opera. Van Hulse maintained the late romantic style, but combined this with modern trends such as Expressionism. In 1956, he retired in order to devote himself entirely to composition. His compositions received numerous awards. In addition to his professional career as a musician, he was also a skilled linguist and is included in the Dictionary of Linguists. He also has a place in the Dictionary of Musicians. In 1930, Camil van Hulse returned to Belgium for the first time. For a while, he traveled back to his native country every two years to visit his family and friends. In 1946 he won four prizes - two awarded by the Society of Arizona Composers for an instrumental composition Suite for Cello and Piano and for a vocal number, and 'The Beatitudes', a choral work with piano and organ accompaniment (first presented in Tucson on 8 May that year). A fourth prize was the national J. Fischer & Bro. prize from the American Guild of Organists, won with his 'Toccata' for Grand Organ.Camil Van Hulse, in: The Diapason, 1 December 1946, p. 3. In 1957, the Bibliotheca Wasiana organized a tribute concert in honor of his sixtieth birthday. For the 750th anniversary of the city of Sint-Niklaas, he wrote The Ballad of the Six Knights for orchestra, choir and baritone solo on a text by Anton van Wilderode.

It consists of a team of approximately 200 volunteers who respond 24/7 to lost person incidents, wilderness rescues, civil emergencies, and evacuations. Early history In the winter of 1969 two children became lost in woods in the Spryfield area during a major winter storm. A dedicated and trained search and rescue team did not exist at the time; so searching was the responsibility of the community and the police department. By the time the storm was over, one of the children and one of the searchers had died of exposure. This event lead to the formation of Waverly Ground Search and Rescue, the first such dedicated organization in the region. The organization would later go on to become Halifax Regional Search and Rescue. Operations Primary jurisdiction of HRSAR The organization's primary operating area is within the Halifax Regional Municipality. However due to the team's expertise and resources, the organization may be called to lead search and rescue operations within the province, and is routinely called to provide mutual aid support and relief for other teams in the Maritime provinces. Over 90% of the team's operations are funded by the community through local fund raising activities and a grant from HRM Fire and Emergency Services. Team members are entirely volunteer, are not paid, and provide their own clothing and equipment. In 2013 the organization responded to 24 calls, including missing person searches, rescues, and police evidence searches. In addition to emergency response, the organization has a significant involvement in wilderness survival training for children and adults. The children's program is named \\"hug-a-tree,\\" and teaches elementary school children what to do if they are lost in the woods. Since its inception, the team has educated over 75,000 children and adults. The team conducts meetings and training every Monday evening, with additional training events occurring on weekends. All volunteers must pass a security check, complete core training, and a one-year probationary period. Notable incidents  Andy Warburton search  On July 1, 1986, a nine-year-old boy wandered into the woods near the Beaverbank area and become lost. A frantic search was launched, which grew to become the largest ground search in Canadian history, involving over 5,000 volunteers. After eight days, the boy was located deceased. This tragic outcome was the impetus for change, which resulted in a revolution in ground search and rescue techniques. In addition to the advent of specialized search training and techniques, the then Waverley Ground Search and Rescue partnered with Kenneth Hill a Saint Mary's University child psychologist to research and profile lost person behaviour. This research was published and become a fundamental component of how ground searches are carried out.  Swiss Air Flight 111  On September 3, 1998, the organization undertook the largest mutual aid search operation in Nova Scotia's history. With the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia, Halifax Regional Search and Rescue was charged with primary responsibility for all ground operations including military operations and other ground SAR teams. On November 5, 1998, 64 days later, volunteers had contributed 48,780 hours with 3,141 person days.  James Delorey search  On December 5, 2009, a seven-year-old non-verbal autistic boy wandered away from his Cape Breton home with his family dog in winter conditions. He was not wearing outdoor clothing. An urgent search was launched by local search and rescue teams, with the Halifax Regional Search and Rescue team later called in to assist as backup. Upon arriving in storm conditions on December 7, members from the Halifax team traced tracks left by Delorey's dog, and subsequently located the missing child alive but unconscious and suffering from severe hypothermia. Delorey was airlifted to the IWK children's hospital in Halifax, where he died the following day.  Garage fire  On January 9, 2013, a major fire at the team's base resulted in the destruction of one of their vehicles, and damage to other vehicles and the garage that housed them. Replacement cost of the lost vehicle alone was estimated to be $100,000, which exceeded the team's entire annual funding. Repair costs for the remaining vehicles and building were additional.  Marty Leger search  On May 29, 2014, a 30-year-old mountain biker on the Spider Lake trails in Waverley, Nova Scotia failed to return from an afternoon ride. That evening Halifax Regional Search and Rescue was brought in by the RCMP to assist in locating him. The search area covered 80 square kilometres of exceptionally dense and rugged terrain. After five days of continuous searching involving numerous helicopters, boats, 450 search and rescue members from teams from as far away as New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and 250 army members from CFB Gagetown, the search was called off. He was never located, and remains an RCMP missing person case.

Problems were identified with security measures at the Benghazi facilities, due to poor decisions made by employees of the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, and specifically its director Eric Boswell, who resigned under pressure in December 2012. Despite numerous allegations against Obama administration officials of scandal, cover-up and lying regarding the Benghazi attack and its aftermath, none of the ten investigations found any evidence to support those allegations. The last of the investigation committees issued its final report and shut down in December of 2016, one month after the 2016 presidential election.The Hill December 12, 2016 retrieved 3 April 2020USA Today December 12, 2016 retrieved 3 April 2020Text of Final Report at Congress.gov retrieved 3 April 2020  Federal Bureau of Investigation  The FBI opened its investigation soon after the attack and it remains ongoing. On May 2, 2013, the FBI released photos of three men from the Benghazi attack site, asking for help from the public in identifying the individuals. On June 16, 2014, in a joint effort by U.S. Special Operations and the FBI near Benghazi, Libya, an alleged ringleader of the Benghazi attack, Ahmed Abu Khattala, was apprehended. He was removed to a U.S. warship in the Mediterranean and was later to be transported to the United States.  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence delivered their bipartisan report on the terrorist attacks on January 15, 2014. The majority of the committee offered the following conclusions: * The attacks were preventable. * There were no protests in the area prior to the attack. * Although the attack did not arise from prior protests, it \\"did not require significant amounts of preplanning\\". * Terrorists who participated in the attacks included members of al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, Ansar al-Sharia, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Mohammad Jamal Network. * The CIA talking points were flawed but still \\"painted a mostly accurate picture of the IC's analysis of the Benghazi attacks at that time, in an unclassified form and without compromising the nascent [FBI] investigation of the attacks\\". * In general, the majority concluded \\"that the interagency coordination process on the talking points followed normal, but rushed coordination procedures and that there were no efforts by the White House or any other Executive Branch entities to 'cover-up' facts or make alterations for political purposes\\".

Nunes wrote that if questions remain unanswered or \\"if some answers differ substantially from the established narrative and timeline of the attack, then it would be warranted to take new measures to complete the investigation and synthesize the information obtained by the Intelligence Committees and other committees investigating the Benghazi attack.\\" On August 1, 2014, the House Intelligence Committee concluded that there was no deliberate wrongdoing by the Obama administration in the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and that news briefing given by the administration reflected the conflicting intelligence assessments in the days immediately following the crisis. Representative Dutch Ruppersberger stated, \\"the intelligence community warned about an increased environment, but did not have specific tactical warning of an attack before it happened.\\" A report, released November 21, 2014, stated that it found no intelligence lapses, that Susan Rice's talking points were \\"flawed\\", and was seen as invalidating several theories; the report was criticized by survivors and politicians, including Senator Lindsey Graham.  State Department Accountability Review Board  As required by the Omnibus Diplomatic and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the State Department established on October 4, 2012, an Accountability Review Board \\"to examine the facts and circumstances of the attacks\\". Four members were selected by Clinton and another was selected by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering served as the Chairman, Admiral Michael Mullen served as the Vice Chairman, also serving were Catherine Bertini, Richard Shinnick, and Hugh Turner, who represented the intelligence community.Pickering, Mullen, et. al, Accountability Review Board report on Benghazi (Unclassified) U.S. Department of State. December 18, 2012. The investigation report was released December 20, 2012. It was seen as a sharp criticism of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. \\"Systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department ... resulted in a special mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,\\" said the unclassified version of the report.Arshad Mohammed, Anna Yukhananov and Tabassum Zakaria Inquiry harshly criticizes State Department over Benghazi attack Reuters.

The Council on Foreign Relations in an initial report saw it as a refutation to the notion that the Obama administration delayed its response.Hounshell, Blake Benghazi Panel Rebuts Conspiracy Theorists Foreign Policy. December 18, 2012. The report confirmed that, contrary to initial accounts, there was no protest outside the consulate. It placed responsibility for the incident solely upon the attackers, deemed as terrorists.  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman (I-CT) and Ranking Member Susan Collins (R-ME) opened an investigation in mid October 2012. Their final report was delivered December 31, 2012. According to the report, \\"there was a high risk of a 'significant' terrorist attack on U.S. employees and facilities in Benghazi in the months before the September 11, 2012, assault on the Mission, and the State Department failed to take adequate steps to reduce the Mission's vulnerability.\\"  House Select Committee  In May 2014, House Speaker John Boehner announced a House select committee would be formed to further investigate the attacks in light of State Department documents released on April 29, 2014, to Judicial Watch, a conservative government watchdog group. These documents, including a cache of previously unreleased emails \\"that House panels had been unable to receive even after issuing a subpoena,\\" were obtained by Judicial Watch under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA): one document in particular, an email written by a White House adviser, has been labeled by conservatives as a \\"smoking gun\\". The House voted May 8, 2014, to establish the United States House Select Committee on Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi, voting 232-186 ‚Äî 225 Republicans and 7 Democrats in favor, 186 Democrats voting against. The Democratic National Committee sent out a statement describing the committee as a \\"ploy\\" and \\"political stunt\\". In a September 29, 2015, Fox TV interview with Sean Hannity, Kevin McCarthy, then in the running for Speaker of the House, said, \\"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened, had we not fought.\\" Many media outlets and Democratic lawmakers interpreted this comment as an admission that the investigation was a partisan political undertaking rather than a substantive inquiry. McCarthy later said his comments should have been phrased more clearly and denied the investigation was overtly political. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified before the Committee and answered members' questions for more than eight hours before the Committee in a public hearing.Michael D. Shear & Michael S. Schmidt, Benghazi Panel Engages Clinton in Tense Session, The New York Times (October 22, 2015). The New York Times reported, \\"the long day of often-testy exchanges between committee members and their prominent witness revealed little new information about an episode that has been the subject of seven previous investigations.\\"  Investigative reporting and opinion commentary  Armed forces attacked the U.S. consulate during a protest against an anti-Islamist film. Numerous eyewitnesses reported that the attackers said they were reacting to the film Innocence of Muslims.David D. Kirkpatrick, \\"Attack by Fringe Group Highlights the Problem of Libya's Militias\\" The New York Times September 15, 2012David D. Kirkpatrick, Election- Year Stakes Overshadow Nuances of Libya Investigation The New York Times October 16, 2012 A Reuters reporter, Hadeel Al-Shalchi, after speaking with authorities, stated: \\"There was definitely a protest planned around the consulate to mimic what happened in Egypt. Security even told me that, you know, people who were sympathetic with the cause from the security may have even allowed, you know, people to riot very close to the consulate.\\" David D. Kirkpatrick and Suliman Ali Zway of The New York Times reported that there was no peaceful demonstration according to witnesses. A militant organization known as Ansar al-Shariah told people on the scene that they were upset over the video.Scott Shane, Clearing the Record About Benghazi The New York Times October 18, 2012 On May 3, 2013, Stephen Hayes wrote in The Weekly Standard, \\"senior Obama administration officials knowingly misled the country about what had happened in the days following the assaults.\\" Hayes said that there was a flurry of revisions made to the talking points in the days before Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, appeared on five Sunday television talk shows. Included in the cuts were references to \\"Islamic extremists\\", reminders of warnings about al Qaeda in Libya, a reference to \\"jihadists\\" in Cairo, the mention of possible surveillance of the facility in Benghazi, and the report of five previous attacks on foreign interests. On May 10, 2013, ABC News' Jonathan Karl reported that Stephen Hayes had \\"obtained 12 different versions of the talking points that show they were extensively edited as they evolved from the drafts first written entirely by the CIA to the final version distributed to Congress and to U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice before she appeared on five talk shows\\". The changes made to the talking points, according to the report, appear to directly contradict what White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said about them in November 2012. Afterwards, Carney stated the reports did not contradict what he said and that it was the CIA's task to review the talking points. The White House then released copies of various emails that were sent to various administration officials shortly after the attack took place to prove that there was no cover up. On the May 12 episode of ABC News' This Week, Karl said that when then-CIA Director David Petraeus saw the final talking points the Saturday before Rice went on the Sunday talk shows he said they were \\"essentially useless\\". Karl went on to quote from an e-mail in which Petraeus said of the talking points: \\"I would just as soon not use them, but it's their [the White House's] call.\\" Research by other media outlets later proved that Karl's report was inaccurate, as his sources had twisted what was written in the documents. On the May 19 episode of ABC News' This Week, Karl announced he regretted reporting the inaccuracy and acknowledged that he exaggerated the words Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes had written in one of emails cited in the documents. Memos written by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland also revealed that she made the revisions because they \\"could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings\\". On July 11, Nuland, who was nominated by Obama to be the top US envoy to Europe, told various members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during a confirmation hearing that she had made the revisions and that she had feared Republicans in Congress would politicize the original memos and present a false impression that various top US State Department officials, including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, had covered-up information about the attack. In August 2013, it was reported by Drew Griffin and Kathleen Johnston of CNN that dozens of CIA operatives were on the ground in Benghazi on the night of the attack.Griffin, Drew; Johnston, Kathleen. \\"Exclusive: Dozens of CIA operatives on the ground during Benghazi attack\\" CNN, August 1, 2013. Their sources say 35 people were on the ground in Benghazi the night of attack, and 21 of those worked in the annex building. They further reported that according to their sources the agency was going to great lengths to keep what they were doing a secret, including polygraphing some of the survivors monthly in order to find out if they were talking to the media or Congress. The actions of the CIA were described as pure intimidation, with any leak risking the loss of a career. Former CIA agent Robert Baer described the frequency of the polygraphs as rare. A six-part report on an investigation by The New York Times on the attack was published on the Times website on December 28, 2013. Based on \\"months of investigation\\" and \\"extensive interviews with Libyans in Benghazi who had direct knowledge of the attack there and its context\\", the investigation found \\"no evidence that Al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups\\" had any role in the assault, but that the attackers included militias that \\"benefited directly from NATO's extensive air power and logistics support\\" overthrowing Colonel Qaddafi, and whom the Americans \\"had taken for allies\\". It found that the US compound \\"had been under surveillance at least 12 hours before the assault started\\", but that the attack also had \\"spontaneous elements\\". > Anger at the video [Innocence of Muslims] motivated the initial attack. > Dozens of people joined in, some of them provoked by the video and others > responding to fast-spreading false rumors that guards inside the American > compound had shot Libyan protesters. Looters and arsonists, without any sign > of a plan, were the ones who ravaged the compound after the initial attack, > according to more than a dozen Libyan witnesses as well as many American > officials who have viewed the footage from security cameras. In the following weeks, several U.S. lawmakers (both Democrats and Republicans), publicly stated, \\"the intelligence indicates that al Qaeda was involved.\\" In April 2014, Seymour Hersh published an essay in the London Review of Books in which he explores an anonymous former Pentagon official's claims that the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi \\"had no real political role\\" and existed solely to provide cover for a secret arms pipeline supporting Syrian rebels fighting in the Syrian Civil War. According to Hersh's source, the \\"rat line\\" was a means for channeling military weapons, including surface- to-air missile launchers (MANPADS), from Gaddafi's arsenals into Syria and into the hands of Syrian rebels. The operation was reportedly funded by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and was conducted by the CIA in collaboration with MI6. Hersh's accounts of covert involvement by the U.S. and allies in the Syrian Civil War have been denied by U.S. and Turkish officials. On October 22, 2015, it was revealed that Clinton had e-mailed her daughter Chelsea at 11:12 p.m. on September 11 that the officers had been killed by an 'Al-Queda like group.'

Terminology  In the post-Soviet era, blatnaya pesnya are marketed largely under the more generalized name \\"Russian chanson\\" (). Coined in the 1990s, \\"Russian chanson\\" has become a marketing neologism akin to world music. These songs are sometimes termed blatnaya muzika (\\"criminal music\\"), which is also the name of a guide to criminal slang used by NKVD agents, the predecessors of the KGB. Some collections identify these songs as ulichnaia pesnia or \\"street songs\\" (), allowing for the inclusion of pieces that do not explicitly involve references to criminal behaviour. According to Robert A. Rothstein, this terminological fluidity: \\"reflects the fact that what makes a song blatnaia is more a question of style and tone than of literal content.\\"  Characteristics  Thematically, blatnaya pesnya focus on injustice and oppression under a political system, depictions of prison life, and celebrations of criminal life and thieves' code of honour. These themes are sometimes combined with sexual innuendo as well as elements of irony and humour. The use of fenya, an underworld slang, is characteristic of blatnaya pesnya lyrics. Also known as blatnoy language (), fenya follows the grammatical structure of the Russian language, but borrows vocabulary from Ukrainian and Yiddish, as well as other languages, including French and Greek. In terms of structure, blatnaya pesnya generally lack choruses, instead consisting of long narratives composed strictly of verses. Blatnaya pesnya have simple melodies, and root position tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords largely constitute the harmonic accompaniment. Consistent oscillation between tonic and dominant chords generally characterize the harmonic movement in these songs. Instrumentation varies, although contemporary songs make use of synthesizer sounds and supporting vocal arrangements. Blatnaya pesnya (under the umbrella term shanson) have also been associated with Klezmer, with an interplay between the genres beginning in nineteenth-century Odessa. \\"Klezmer-blatnoi hybrids\\" continue to be performed today, such as the Yiddish satire \\"Mein Yihus\\" (\\"my elder brother is a card shark, my mother is a prostitute\\"). Instrumental similarities link the genres, including the prevalence of up-tempo clarinets, horns, and accordion.  Odessa and Jewish identity  During the Soviet era, the multi-ethnic port city of Odessa served as the center for blatnaya pesnya, both literally and metaphorically. Odessa is a frequent subject in blatnaya pesnya, and the city took on a mythical role as the cradle of Jewish gangster culture. Blatnaya pesnya are steeped in the mythology of Old Odessa, a city of excess, and a paradise for thieves, where a prominent Russian-Jewish culture was associated with both wealth and sin. Although wrapped up in criminality and debauchery, Odessa was also \\"a land of wit and irony\\", in which Yiddish-inflected humour, brought over from the shtetls of Eastern Europe became the primary lens through which Old Odessa was depicted. Russian writer Isaac Babel popularized this image of \\"a city of swashbuckling Jewish swindlers and sinners\\", and the Jewish gangster came to epitomize Odessa in Soviet culture, in contradistinction to the victimized, tradition-oriented stereotype of the shtetl Jew. \\"Odessa- mama\\", a popular Yiddish and Russian collocation in literature and song, can be understood as a reference to the city's hospitality to criminals. Major figures in the contemporary scene maintain a connection with Jewish culture. In May 2006, √©migr√© singer-songwriter Willi Tokarev (11 November 1934 ‚Äì 4 August 2019) drew a significant crowd to the Moscow Jewish Community Center, a Lubavitcher-run center financed by oligarchs. Tokarev's songs also explicitly address Jewish identity and immigration (e.g. \\"Why Are the Jews Leaving?\\"), and in 2006 he toured Russia and Israel to promote \\"Hello Israel,\\" a Jewish- themed collection of songs. Mikhail Shufutinsky (born 13 April 1948), another international celebrity based in Los Angeles, sings songs based on Jewish themes and melodies, including \\"Song of a Jewish Tailor\\" (Russian: \\"–ï–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–Ω–æ–π\\").  History   Origins  The origins of this song genre are in nineteenth-century Russia, and its precedents include the songs of serfs and czarist political prisoners, as well as Bolshevik prison protest songs. Given the glorification of criminality in these songs, blatnaya pesnya are often compared to western gangster rap.  Soviet era  The genre took hold in the early years of the Soviet era, but blatnaya pesnya proliferated after Stalin's death. The relative relaxation of censorship, and loosening of social control during the Khrushchev and Brezhnev eras, gave rise to an illicit and underground second culture, of which blatnaya pesnya were an important part. These songs were sung in homes and clandestine concerts, and secretly recorded and distributed in order to circumvent the backlash of political authorities (a practice known as magnitizdat). The repression under Stalin, as well as the experiences of many Soviet citizens in the gulags, led to a distinct form of blatnaya pesnya that depicted the terrors of this period while simultaneously mocking them. Blatnaya pesnya functioned as an important cultural alternative to sanctioned socialist realism during the Soviet era. Russian writer and dissident Andrei Sinyavsky (8 October 1925 ‚Äì 25 February 1997) argued that blatnaya pesnya represented the true music of the Soviet people, where criminalization and imprisonment served as the only bond among citizens.  Modern Russian context and commercialization  No longer a clandestine practice, Saint Petersburg now serves as the unofficial capital of the genre. Popular with older generations of Russians, these songs hold a vital position in the contemporary Russian music scene. Because of the subject matter and obscenity, blatnaya pesnya are denounced by politicians and public officials, but remain highly popular among citizens. Some contemporary radio stations in Russia are dedicated solely to this music, including Moscow's Radio Shanson (Russian: –†–∞–¥–∏–æ —à–∞–Ω—Å–æ–Ω) channel.  American context  During the 1970s, as Soviet immigrants came to New York City, Brighton Beach became the foremost Western center for the production and distribution of blatnaya pesnya. These songs, along with other banned cultural products, made their way back to the USSR via sailors and diplomats, and several performers based in New York City became √©migr√© stars in Russia, including Mikhail Shufutinsky and Willi Tokarev.  Notable Performers  Some notable performers of blatnaya pesnya include: Leonid Utyosov (21 March 1895 ‚Äì 9 March 1982), Mikhail Krug (7 April 1962 ‚Äì 30 June 2002), Vladimir Vysotsky (25 January 1938 ‚Äì 25 July 1980), Arkady Severny (12 March 1939 ‚Äì 12 April 1980), Alexander Rosenbaum (born 13 September 1951), Willi Tokarev (11 November 1934 ‚Äì 4 August 2019), and Mikhail Shufutinsky (born 13 April 1948).  Representative repertoire  Several popular blatnaya pesnya are recognized as Odessa folklore, and have been recorded by numerous artists including Leonid Utyosov and Arkady Severny. \\"Na Moldavanke muzyka igraet\\" (\\"Music is Playing in Moldavanka\\")‚Äîa reference to an historical part of Odessa‚Äîis also known as \\"Pesnia o Kol'ke-Shirmache\\" (\\"The Song About Kol'ka the Pickpocket\\") and dates from 1931 at the earliest. In this song, Kostia, the boss of the Odessa underworld, sends Mania to the labour camp at the White Sea‚ÄìBaltic Canal in order to help Kol'ka escape. Upon her arrival, Mania discovers that the camp has rehabilitated Kol'ka. The song ends with the death of Kol'ka, on Kostia's orders, for his violation of the criminal code of honour. Another song called \\"S odesskogo kichmana\\" (\\"From the Odessa Jail\\") dates from the 1920s and tells the story of two prisoners' escape, during which one of the thieves is wounded. Variants of the song exist, and in some versions the wounded escapee asks his comrade to bury him, while in others he asks that his friend relay to his mother that he died in combat. Willi Tokarev became famous in the Soviet Union during the 1980s for his songs depicting life as a Russian √©migr√© in New York City. Two of his songs that express the difficulty of assimilating to American society and the struggle to abandon the criminal way of life include \\"New Yorkskiy Taksist\\" (\\"New York Taxi Driver\\") from his 1981 album V Shumnom Balagane (In a Noisy Saloon), and \\"Nad Gudzonom\\" (\\"Over the Hudson\\") from his 1983 album of the same name.

Biography James Audley was born in 1220 to Henry Audley and Bertha de Mesnilwarin,p.220, Walter Chetwynd's History of Pirehill Hundred], published in 'Collections for a History of Staffordshire', Vol. XXII New Series (1909): and by Bertha, the daughter of Ralph de Mesnilwarin (with whom he had in frank-marriage ye manors of Smalwood and Snelston, and half ye town of Pickmere, co. Cestr.), left issue James Ld. Audley and was, like his father, a lord-marcher. In 1257 he accompanied Richard, king of the Romans, to his coronation at Aachen (Matt. Paris), sailing on 29 April (Rymer) and returning to England in the autumn to take part in the Welsh campaign (1257-1260). In the following year (1258) he was one of the royalist members of the council of fifteen nominated by the Provisions of Oxford, and witnessed, as 'James of Aldithel,' their confirmation by the king (18 Oct.). He also, with his brother-in-law, Peter de Montfort, was appointed commissioner to treat with Llewelyn (18 Aug.), and two years later he acted as an itinerant justice. On Llewelyn of Wales attacking Mortimer, a royalist marcher, Audley joined Prince Edward at Hereford, 9 January 1263 to resist the invasion. But the barons, coming to Llewelyn's assistance, dispersed the royalist forces, and seized on his castles and estates. He is wrongly said by Dugdale and Foss to have been made 'justice of Ireland' in this year, but in December he was one of the royalist sureties in the appeal to Louis of France. At the time of the battle of Lewes (May 1264) he was in arms for the king on the Welsh marches (Matthew Paris), and he was one of the first to rise against the government of Simon de Montfort. On Gloucester embracing the royal cause, early in 1265, Audley joined him with the other marchers, and took part in the campaign of Evesham and the overthrow of the baronial party. He appears to have gone on a pilgrimage to Galicia in 1268, and also, it is stated, to Palestine in 1270; but though his name occurs among the 'Crucesignati' of 21 May 1270, it is clear that he never went, for he was appointed justiciary of Ireland a few months later, his name first occurring in connection with that office 5 September 1270. He also served as High Sheriff of Staffordshire and Shropshire in 1261 and 1270. During his tenure as Justiciar of Ireland he led several expeditions against 'the Irish rebels,' but died by 'breaking his neck' about 11 June 1272 (when he is last mentioned as justiciary), and was succeeded by his son James, who did homage 29 July 1272.

However, little is known of Carloss's time in Louisiana except for his service as a first lieutenant and captain in the Confederate States Army, particularly in May 1863, less than three months after his first marriage. He fought in the Siege of Port Hudson near Baton Rouge and was believed to have been mortally wounded. He soon recovered but surrendered to Union forces on July 8. In March 1863, Carloss married in Bossier Parish the former Emma A. Stewart, and the couple had three children, Robert A., Virginia W., and Theodosia Carloss. After Emma's death, he married in 1877 during his last year in the Louisiana House Mary F. Parks (1833‚Äì1909), not in Louisiana but in Lafayette County in southwestern Arkansas. He earned his livelihood as a farmer. John Sidney Killen, a farmer and cattleman in first Claiborne Parish and then Webster Parish after its creation in 1871, was in office that year.

Prior to this, under the name Lubov Roudenko she was a former soloist for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the late 1930s and early 1940s, afterwards performing on Broadway throughout the 1940s. Early life Luba Rudenko was born 28 November 1921 in Sofia, Bulgaria, to Russian parents. Her father, Nicholas, had been a former officer in the Russian Imperial Guard, and following the Russian Revolution, he and his wife became refugees while the rest of their family were killed. They moved to Paris, where Nicholas Rudenko ran a Russian restaurant until it was forced to close following the 1932 assassination of President Paul Doumer by a Russian √©migr√©. Following this, the family relied on Luba's skill as a dancer to help them, with Luba later recollecting \\"There were times when I had to win first place in a contest so we could eat.\\" Dancing In 1938 Rudenko was signed up to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where, at 17, she was their youngest soloist. Her stage name was Lubov Roudenko, and she was also popularly known as \\"Spitfire Lu-Lu.\\" She had a can- can sequence in the 1938 ballet Ga√Æt√© Parisienne choreographed specially for her by L√©onide Massine. She would later reprise this role in the 1941 Oscar- nominated short film The Gay Parisian. Whilst with the Ballet Russes, Rudenko was the subject of several drawings by Henri Matisse in 1939. Four of his portrait sketches of her are now in the Fogg Museum. Matisse also made a drawing of Rudenko in the ballet Rouge et Noir. While on tour with the Ballet Russe, Rudenko performed the role of the Cowgirl in the 1942 ballet Rodeo until the tour reached New York and Agnes de Mille, the original choreographer, reclaimed the role for herself. Disappointed by this, Rudenko quit the Ballet Russes, and took a better-paid job performing in a Broadway production of The Merry Widow. This production launched at the Majestic Theatre on 4 August 1943, with Rudenko and James Starbuck leading the character dances, including a comic polka and a can-can number. After this, Rudenko played Grisette in Nellie Bly, a short-lived 1946 musical based on the life of Nellie Bly, and then became lead dancer for the 1946-49 Broadway production of Annie Get Your Gun, but following a knee injury, decided to pursue a career in fashion design. She continued performing until 1951, appearing in the 1950-51 Olsen and Johnson revue Pardon our French. Fashion Luba married Richard Marks in 1948, and in 1957, they launched their new company, Elite Juniors. Elite Jrs. was a middle-range firm producing high-style coats, suits and separates for a fifth of the expected price. Luba first caught the attention of the fashion press by successfully reinterpreting the classic Chanel suit for ready-to-wear. Her designs were cut slim-fitting, with narrow sleeves and no bust darts, meaning that her designs looked more elegant and desirably Parisian than those of her rivals in the ready-to-wear field. Luba was also noted as an early promoter of the woman's pantsuit in America, dedicating over half of her 1966 collection to this look. It was noted that some of her pantsuit designs came out before Yves Saint Laurent produced his own very similar designs. In 1968, alongside George Halley, Luba Marks won the Coty Award for her womenswear. At the time it was noted that her clothes were worn by smart young women such as actress Jill St. John and singer Petula Clark, and younger women in politics such as Luci Nugent. Luba noted that her clientele's age range ran from 16 to 70. By 1976 Elite Juniors had been acquired by Peabody House, and despite their marriage having broken down, the Markses were still working together successfully. That year Luba predicted that the business would turn over 7 to 8 million dollars, forecasting that this would rise to 12 million. She was still working in 1984, selling her coats and other designs through Bullock's and describing herself as trying to continue offering originality.

It is named after John Wetzel, a mathematician at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign... Let F be a family of distinct analytic functions on a given domain with the property that, for each x in the domain, the functions in F map x to a countable set of values. In his doctoral dissertation, Wetzel asked whether this assumption implies that F is necessarily itself countable.. As cited by . Paul Erd≈ës in turn learned about the problem at the University of Michigan, likely via Lee Albert Rubel. In his paper on the problem, Erd≈ës credited an anonymous mathematician with the observation that, when each x is mapped to a finite set of values, F is necessarily finite. However, as Erd≈ës showed, the situation for countable sets is more complicated: the answer to Wetzel's question is yes if and only if the continuum hypothesis is false.. That is, the existence of an uncountable set of functions that maps each argument x to a countable set of values is equivalent to the nonexistence of an uncountable set of real numbers whose cardinality is less than the cardinality of the set of all real numbers. One direction of this equivalence was also proven independently, but not published, by another UIUC mathematician, Robert Dan Dixon. It follows from the independence of the continuum hypothesis, proved in 1963 by Paul Cohen,. that the answer to Wetzel's problem is independent of ZFC set theory. Erd≈ës' proof is so short and elegant that it is considered to be one of the Proofs from THE BOOK. In the case that the continuum hypothesis is false, Erd≈ës asked whether there is a family of analytic functions, with the cardinality of the continuum, such that each complex number has a smaller-than-continuum set of images. As Ashutosh Kumar and Saharon Shelah later proved, both positive and negative answers to this question are consistent.

Hyde, PhD, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc, Publishers, New York Education and career Dr. Hyde was born in 1932 in Mitchell, South Dakota. He received his BS degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in physics in 1954. He continued his studies at MIT and received his PhD degree in solid-state physics in the laboratory of Professor Arthur R. von Hippel in 1959. He was employed that year by the Analytical Instrument Division of Varian Associates in Palo Alto, California. In this capacity, he has been credited with leading the evolution of EPR spectroscopy from applications in physics to applications in chemistry and biology. His colleagues at Varian were well known in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): M.E. Packard, Richard R. Ernst, W. A. Anderson, R. Freeman, which may have influenced his later research in MRI. In 1975 he was recruited by H. M. Swartz to join the faculty of the Medical College of Wisconsin. The partnership of Hyde and Swartz led to successful NIH funding of a Research Resource in EPR. Dr. Hyde later became involved in early TR&D; research in the field of MRI through long-standing interactions between MCW and General Electric Medical Systems based in Milwaukee, WI. Dr. Hyde has mentored a number of PhD students who have successful academic careers in both MRI and EPR. Research in EPR While at Varian, Dr. Hyde and his colleagues extended the technique of electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), which had been introduced by G. Feher Feher, G., Observation of Nuclear Magnetic Resonances via the Electron Spin Resonance Line. Phys. Rev., 103:834-835, 1956 for the study of donors in silicon, to the liquid phase,Hyde, J.

H., Electron-electron double resonance of free radicals in solution. J. Chem. Phys., 48:4211-4226, 1968 He discovered a way to measure very slow rotational diffusion of proteins,Hyde, J. S., Dalton, L., Very slowly tumbling spin labels: Adiabatic rapid passage. Chem. Phys. Lett. 16:568-572, 1972 and also introduced the EPR pulse technique known as saturation recovery for the measurement of electron spin lattice relaxation times of free radicals and spin labels in the fluid phase. At MCW, a key advance was a novel sample-containing structure which became known as the loop-gap resonator (LGR).Froncisz, W., and Hyde, J. S.: The Loop-Gap Resonator: A New Microwave Lumped Circuit ESR Sample Structure. J. Magn. Reson. 47:515-521, 1982 It was an enabling structure for the extension of EPR spectroscopy to a range of microwave frequencies from 500 MHz to 140 GHz. In addition, the technique of saturation recovery was further developed across most of this range of microwave frequencies, which led to an extensive body of work on transport and cellular consumption of oxygen.Froncisz, W., Lai, C.-S., and Hyde, J. S., Spin-Label Oximetry: Kinetic Study of Cell Respiration Using a Rapid-Passage T1-Sensitive Electron Spin Resonance Display. Proc. Natl. Acad., Sci. USA. 82:411-415, 1985 Pulse experiments on oxygen transport at 90 GHz are particularly notable because of the small sample volume, about 20 nL. Research in MRI, fMRI and fcMRI In MRI, Dr. Hyde recognized that the LGR technology of EPR could be extended to radio frequency (RF) surface coils for improved diagnostic radiology. The principle was established that the best images were obtained by designing special RF coils with dimensions that corresponded to the anatomy that was of interest.Hyde, J.S.: Surface and Other Local Coils for In Vivo NMR Studies. In Grant, D. M., and Harris, R. K., (Eds), Encyclopedia of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, pp. 4656-4664. New York, NY, John Wiley, 1996 He also introduced to MRI the first report on parallel acquisition of MRI data from multiple non-interacting surface coils.Hyde, J. S., Jesmanowicz, A., Froncisz, W., Kneeland, J. B., Grist, T. M., and Campagna, N. F.: Parallel Image Acquisition from Noninteracting Local Coils. J. Magn. Reson. 70:512-517, 1986 Gradient coils are required in order to make an image, and it was natural to consider use of a local gradient coil that was tailored to the anatomy of interest. A local RF coil inside of a local gradient coil was developed for the human wrist. The configuration was then extended to the human head, which led to one of the first papers on human functional MRI (fMRI).Bandettini, P. A., Wong, E. C., Hinks, R. S., Tikofsky, R. S., and Hyde, J.

The same equipment also was used in the discovery of MRI resting state human functional connectivity (fcMRI), a very heavily cited paper that led to the founding of a new journal: Brain Connectivity, and the funding of the Human Connectome Project. In current work, the basic coil design is being used by Dr. Hyde for fMRI and fcMRI studies of connectivity in rat brain at a field strength of 9.4 Tesla and a resolution of 200 microns in each dimension.

The case, according to this advertisement, was \\"handsome and permanent.\\" Dr. Young's Ideal Rectal Dilators were medical devices sold in the United States from the late nineteenth century until at least the 1940s, part of the burgeoning market for patent and proprietary medicines and devices at the time. They came in sets of four \\"torpedolike\\" hard-rubber (later, plastic) instruments varying in diameter from to 1 inch and in length from 3 to 4 inches, and according to a retrospective article in The American Journal of Gastroenterology, were no different from modern rectal dilators. Early claims and criticism Detroit Medical Journal, August 1905 An 1893 Medical News editorial noted that \\"Dr. Young\\" himself, writing in another journal of which he was the editor, praised rectal dilation as a cure for insanity, claiming that at least \\"three-fourths of all the howling maniacs of the world\\" were curable \\"in a few weeks' time by the application of orificial methods\\". The Medical News asked, A 1905 advertisement by F.E. Young and Co. of Chicago promised that \\"The best results may be obtained by the use of Young's self-retaining rectal dilators\\", the use of which \\"accomplishes for the invalid just what nature does daily for the healthy individual\\". Doctors were advised that \\"If you will prescribe a set of these dilators in some of your obstinate cases of Chronic Constipation you will find them necessary in every case of this kind\\". The price of a set \\"to the profession\\" was $2.50 (). Young admitted that some patients panicked at the sight of the devices. Condemnation by Food and Drug Administration A set of Dr. Young's Ideal Rectal Dilators In 1940 the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York seized a shipment of the devices as misbranded. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's subsequent Drugs and Devices Court Case Notice of Judgment (captioned \\"U.S. v. 67 Sets of Dr. Young's Rectal Dilators and 83 Packages of Dr. Young's Piloment\\") the product's labeling claimed it corrected constipation, promoted more refreshing sleep, and could relieve foul breath, bad taste in the mouth, sallow skin, acne, anemia, lassitude, mental hebetude, insomnia, anorexia, headaches, diarrhea, hemorrhoids, flatulence, indigestion, nervousness, irritability, cold extremities, and numerous other ailments.

The mill was built in the early 1870s, and is the oldest extant stone grist mill in Alabama. It was built by James Eichelburger McCosh, whose grandfather, Jacob Eichelburger, operated earlier mills that were similar to those in his native Pennsylvania. McCosh also owned 500 acres (200 ha) of farmland nearby, and later added a cotton gin to the site. The mill operated until 1958, and was purchased in 1970 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as part of the West Point Lake reservoir project. The mill sits on the sloped bank of Wehadkee Creek, and is 3.5 stories tall on the stream side and 2.5 stories on the bank side. It is constructed of unfinished stones, however features details such as finished stones as quoins, courses of rectangular stones between the doors and cornice, and half millstones as window and door arches. There are two entrances on the main floor, with a large opening above that was probably used to hoist grain to the upper story for storage. The side elevations have two windows per floor, while the rear has four, all with stone sills and wooden lintels. The creek side originally featured a 12-foot wide by 20-foot diameter (3.5 by 6 m) water wheel, which was replaced with three turbines around 1900. The dam which fed the mill race sits about 500 feet (150 m) upstream, is 8 feet high by 125 feet long (2.5 by 38 m), and is also constructed of stone. See also: The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux-based personal computers in January 2015, after being funded via a successful Kickstarter campaign. HuniePop is available in two different versions, an uncensored version available via Humble Bundle and MangaGamer, and a censored version via Steam. The game follows the dating adventures of the main character as he or she tries to woo several different women in their home town. In February 2015, Koons released an update that gave HuniePop a new ending that unlocks options that make it easier for players to fill out a female character's profile and select date locations, among other options. Due to its strong sexual content and themes, Twitch blocked users from streaming gameplay footage of the title, regardless of which version of the game was being played. Gameplay tennis court. Gameplay focuses on the player character (who can be male or female) interacting with several different women, each of whom has her own distinct personalities and preferences. The player can interact with women by talking to them and giving them gifts. Doing this rewards the player with \\"Hunie\\", an in-game currency that can be used to upgrade the player's stats. These stats allow the player to earn more points during dates, increasing their chance of success. In order to progress through the game, players must take the women on dates, where they will play a tile matching game where they must make matches of 3 or more of the same tokens. The player must earn enough points to complete the date before they run out of moves. Each woman has a specific type of token that they like and dislike, and players will gain more points if they match the type of token that the woman prefers. The player can also use special items called \\"date gifts\\" during their dates which grant positive effects to help the player earn more points. After a successful date, the player is rewarded with a picture of the woman the date was with. Each successful date will also raise the game's difficulty, making subsequent dates require more points to complete. After 3 successful dates with a woman, the player will be able to take them on a date at night, and if that date is successful, the player can bring the woman to their bedroom for one final round of tile matching (and, if this is successful, have sexual intercourse with her). Unlike regular dates, the player has unlimited moves to complete the bedroom game, but the score meter constantly drains over time, so to win, matches must be made quickly until the meter is full. Throughout the game the player is guided by Kyu, a love fairy set on turning the player into a successful Lothario. She gives the player tips on how to interact with each woman and explains how the game's various mechanics work. She also becomes dateable after one bedroom game. Development A Kickstarter campaign was launched with a minimum funding goal of $20,000. The Kickstarter ended successfully, raising $53,536 from 1,483 backers. Reception HuniePop has received positive reception. Hardcore Gamer gave the game a rating of four out of five, writing \\"HuniePop is pornography‚Äîdarn fine pornography at that‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also a shockingly good puzzle game. Occasionally those two identities feel at odds with each other, but for the most part they work in concert to show you a good time.\\" Kotaku also gave a mostly positive review, praising it for being \\"strategically deep and challenging enough to kick a Candy Crush casual's ass\\" while also commenting that the game lacked a \\"strong finish\\". GameZone's Mike Splechta called the game \\"fun and engaging\\". Destructoid criticized the game's conversations as lacking in variety while stating that \\"In the end, I realize this is a game that, while riddled with issues, I liked a lot. A whole lot. In fact, with better writing and some more care given to the characters to flesh them out, it could be so much more.\\" Legacy Since HuniePop's release, there have been other games inspired by it, such as Front Wing's Purino Party. On April 4, 2016, Koons released a spin-off game called HunieCam Studio. HunieCam Studio is an adult themed business simulation game, and features many of the characters who previously appeared in HuniePop. The game's art style also shifted to a more cartoon style, away from the anime- based art. Kotaku gave HunieCam Studio a mixed review, commenting that although the game's text was occasionally entertaining, they found the overall game experience to be \\"extremely boring\\". A sequel, HuniePop 2: Double Date, is in production. It is a sequel to HuniePop with the player controlling the same protagonist, and will feature returning characters from HuniePop and HunieCam Studio.

P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999 was a division of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in April 1937 in Aragon from the militarized Columna Durruti during the reorganization of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces. The 26th Division included the 119th, 120th and 121st mixed brigades throughout the Civil War. It fought in the Huesca Offensive, the Battle of Belchite, the Aragon Offensive and the Battle of the Segre. Finally it was disbanded in February 1939 after the withdrawal and rush to the border that followed the rebel Catalonia Offensive. History First phase: Aragon The 26th Division was established on 28 April 1937 in Bujaraloz with former anarchist militiamen and corresponded to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd regiments of the Durruti Division, the successor of the Durruti Column after the column's militarization in January 1937. It was placed under the 11th Army Corps (XI Cuerpo de Ej√©rcito). The command of the unit was entrusted to Ricardo Sanz Garc√≠a who had been the commander of the Durruti Column after Buenaventura Durruti's death and who would be the division's only leader. The violent events of the 1937 May Days overwhelmed Barcelona when the division had been barely constituted. The 26th Division was then gathered in Barbastro in order to march over the city and restore order on behalf of the government. However, when the troops listened to the radio reports of the events by anarchist leader and Justice Minister Garc√≠a Oliver, they refused to intervene and decided to remain in Barbastro.Hugh Thomas (1976), Historia de la Guerra Civil Espa√±ola p√°g. 711 Later in September the unit saw combat action in the Battle of Belchite, where its battle behaviour was clumsy, disorganized and inefficient at best. \\"General Kl√©ber\\" commented about the 119th Mixed Brigade of the division that: 'It is totally useless' (\\"No sirve para nada...\\")Carlos Engel (1999), Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del Ej√©rcito Popular de la Rep√∫blica, p. 156 Actions in Catalonia and extinction In March 1938 the sweeping Aragon Offensive of the rebel faction caught the 26th Division by surprise and the whole unit retreated eastwards to Catalonia without putting any noteworthy fight. Later it was located at the Segre Frontline where it took part in the fruitless Balaguer Offensive in May. Most of the 26th Division remained at the Segre front until the end of 1938, but one of the battalions of the 120th Mixed Brigade of the division was at the Battle of the Ebro. At the onset of the rebel Catalonia Offensive the division held fast its position at the Tremp bridgehead in an unfruitful effort to stop the sweeping advance of the Francoist armies. On 2 January 1939 its 120th and 121st mixed brigades were crushed by the rebel attacks and suffered numerous casualties. Both brigades were withdrawn in order to be reorganized and, despite the previous record of the division, the 121st brigade was highly commended for its battle actions during the bridgehead combats. Since the seriousness of the situation did not leave any option but withdrawal, the 26th Division joined the hasty retreat of the defeated republican military units towards the French border. Once in France the survivors of the division were interned in concentration camps by the French authorities. Post-Civil War The Second World War began barely five months after the capitulation of the Spanish Republic. While some of the members of the 26th Division remained in the concentration camps, some of them were forced to join the French Armed Forces. A number of them were part of the 9th Armoured Company of the 2nd Armoured Division of the Free French Forces, where they formed a majority so that it was known by its Spanish nickname \\"La Nueve\\" or \\"La Espa√±ola\\". This company was one of the first to enter Paris in 1944 in order to free the city from Nazi occupation. Among the first tanks that entered the city one was named \\"Guadalajara\\" and another \\"Ebro\\", in memory of the Spanish Civil War battles; they were manned by members of the former 26th Division whose standard was the Spanish Republican flag.

Morphological and molecular evidences for a new species of Lignosus (Polyporales, Basidiomycota) from tropical China. Mycologia Progress 1‚Äì5. In Malaysia, the tiger milk mushroom is more often known as \\"Cendawan Susu Rimau\\" and is hailed as Malaysia‚Äôs national treasure. It has been used traditionally as a health tonic. According to folklore, the name is based on a story in which the relatively uncommon fungus grows on the spot where a tigress drips her milk while feeding her cubs. History The tiger milk mushroom was first reported in 1664 when a European government agent was given this product upon sailing to the South East Asian Region. According to The Diary of John Evelyn (Publication dated 22 June 1664), this mushroom was named ‚ÄòLac tygridis‚Äô, meaning \\"tiger‚Äôs milk\\". In his publication, Evelyn also recorded that this fungus was used by the local people to treat diseases for which European doctors found no cure. In 1890, Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley, the father of Malaya‚Äôs rubber industry, recorded that this fungus was an important medicinal mushroom used by local communities.Ridley HN.1890.On the so-called Tiger's milk,'susu rimau'of the Malays[j].Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society(22):341‚Äì344. He even attempted to cultivate it but failed. In the same year, this fungus was scientifically documented by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke who named it as Fomes rhinocerotis based on a specimen found in Penang.Cooke.1879.'XV.Enumeration of Polyporus [J].Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh,13(1):131‚Äì159. Today, it is known by the scientific name Lignosus rhinocerus. Botanical Description Lignosus rhinocerus has a centrally stipulate pileus . That's simply a mushroom cap which grows at the end of a stipe (stem) arising from a district buried tuber or sclerotium.Ryvarden, L. and Johansen, I. 1980. A preliminary polypore flora of East Africa. Fungiflora. Oslo. 1-636. Unlike most other type of mushrooms, this fungus has unique growth habit. Their growth is solitary, and can find only one fruit body at a time. This species is classified as precious and rare due to the uniqueness of the solitary growth habit, and the distance between one fruit body and another is not less than 5 km. Tiger milk mushrooms are said to emerge from the very spot where the milk of a prowling tigeress has spilt on the ground. The underground fungus has tuber/sclerotia, where it will remain for a period of anywhere from a month to decades. The presence of this sclerotium can only be seen when the mushroom sprouts. Medicinal properties of tiger milk mushrooms are only found in underground, in the tuber or sclerotium, but unfortunately once formation of the mushroom's cap and/or stem has happened, it's believed to cause depletion of most of its nutrients. Claimed benefits A 2018 review of the testing of investigations into Lignosus rhinocerotis concluded that \\"there is a paucity of validation studies including human clinical trials of the mycochemicals of L. rhinocerotis.\\" Traditionally, the Tiger milk mushrooms have been used for more than 400 years as a health tonic by the aborigines or native for its healing properties on more than 15 types of medical ailments, including; treatment of lung and respiratory diseases (including asthma, cough), fever, vomit, breast cancer, chronic hepatitis, gastric ulcer, food poisoning. It's also believed to help with wound healing and indigestion. Aborigines also boil it with Tongkat ali and used it as general tonic to strengthen the body.(Chang, Y.S. and Lee, S.S. (2001). Utilization of wild mushrooms by the Temuans in Selangor,Malaysia. Poster presented at CFFPR 2001, 100 Year Celebration of Forestry Research, 1-3 Oct 2001, Nikko Hotel, Kuala Lumpur.) Medicinal properties Tiger milk mushrooms have received much interest in recent years, owing to its wide- ranging enthobotanical uses, and the success in domestication of the mushroom. Several studies have been initiated to examine its safety and biopharmacological efficacy in order to validate its enthobotanical claims. Research findings have revealed that tiger milk mushroom sclerotia to contain various biologically active substances, such as polysaccharides, polysaccharides-protein complexes, and Œ≤-glucan, which demonstrate anti- inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-proliferative and immuno-modulating effects. Safety assessment Tiger milk mushrooms have been used for several hundred years, with no known toxicity or side effects. In accordance with OECD guidelines, various stringent toxicity studies have been conducted, and the mushroom's safety has been scientifically assessed. Preclinical toxicological evaluation of the cultivated sclerotium of Lignosus rhinoceros tested on rats have shown the treatment did not establish any pathological changes in the liver, kidney, heart, spleen, and lung and also had no adverse effect on the fertility of the subject nor induce tetratogenic effect on their offspring.S.S. Lee, et al., ‚ÄúEvaluation of the Sub-Acute Toxicity of the Sclerotium of Lignosus rhinoceros (Cooke), The Tiger Milk Mushroom,‚Äù Journal of Ethnopharmacology 138, 192‚Äì200 (2011)S.S. Lee, et al., ‚ÄúPreclinical Toxicological Evaluations of the Sclerotium of Lignosus rhinocerus (Cooke), The Tiger Milk Mushroom,‚Äù Journal of Ethnopharmacology 147, 157‚Äì163 (2013). In addition, screening by The Toxicology Laboratory of the National Poison Center, Malaysia concluded no corticosteroid were found in the cultivated tiger milk mushroom.Tan,C.S.,Ng,S.T.,YeannieYap,H.Y.,Lee,S.S.,Lee,M.L.,Fung,S.Y.,Tan,N.H.,Sim, S.M., 2012.Breathing new life to a Malaysia lost national treasure‚Äîthe Tiger- Milk mushroom (Lignosus rhinocerotis). In:Zhang,J.Wang,H.Chen,M.(Eds.), Mushroom ScienceXVIII:Proceedings of the 18th Congress of the International Society for Mushroom Science. Beijing:China Agriculture Press, pp. 66‚Äì71.). Cultivation As a result of its unique growth habit, it is difficult to find. The inconsistent supply of raw material and uneven harvest quality, coupled with lack of research, prevents further exploration and study into the possible health potential of the traditional health tonic. In the past, the mushroom had never been able to enter large-scale commercialization, until Tan Chon Seng, a researcher from MARDI (Malaysian Agricultural Research & Development Institute) made a breakthrough in 2008 by successfully cultivating tiger milk mushrooms with solid fermentation technology.Tan C S, Ng S T, Vikineswary S, et al. 2009.

The lower one was one long room, like a church, with the pulpit at one end, and benches set in rows all the way back, and big doors openin' out on both sides, so 's the gang-planks could be laid right to 'em for the people to get in easy, and the devil would n't have any room to talk about religious folks holdin' theirselves so up and above others. The top story had a hall down the middle, and sleepin'-rooms on each side. We eat in the hall, and had one of the little rooms for a cook-room. Then there was a real nice little steeple on top.\\"The Floating Bethel in The Century Magazine http://www.unz.org/Pub/Century-1894dec-00297  Destruction  The Floating Bethel burned down before it got out of the Ohio River. It caught fire and was completely destroyed in 1898 or 1899 according to different sources, yet timbers were salvaged from the wreck and were used in the construction of two homes in the Park View section of Moundsville.

The most common forms of all-wheel drive are: ;4√ó4 (also, four-wheel drive and 4WD): Reflecting two axles with both wheels on each capable of being powered. ;6√ó6 (also, six-wheel drive and 6WD): Reflecting three axles with both wheels on each capable of being powered. ;8√ó8 (also, eight-wheel drive and 8WD): Reflecting four axles with both wheels on each capable of being powered. Vehicles may be either part-time all-wheel drive or full-time: ;On-demand (also, part-time): One axle is permanently connected to the drive, the other is being connected as needed ;Full-time (also, permanent): All axles are permanently connected, with or without a differential. ;Independent : The wheels are driven, but not dependent on a central mechanical power coupling. Usage of the terminology Particularly in North America for several decades, the designation AWD has been used and marketed - distinctly from \\"4X4\\" and \\"4WD\\" - to apply to vehicles with drive train systems that have permanent drive, a differential between the front and rear drive shafts, and active management of torque transfer, especially following the advent of ABS. However, the designations AWDAllisons.org Automotive History \\"1929: AEC started to build AWD trucks in conjunction with FWD (UK)\\" and all-wheel driveMEYER, DONALD E. THE FIRST CENTURY OF GMC TRUCK HISTORY \\"By December [1939], GMC had orders for more than 4,400 all-wheel- drive military trucks.\\" long predated the trend, with Associated Equipment Company (AEC) producing AWD trucks in 1929 in conjunction with the British subsidiary of the pioneering American firm, Four Wheel Drive Auto Company. Additionally, General Motors began manufacturing a line as \\"all-wheel drive\\" as early as the late 1930s. This distinction in terminology is not generally used outside North America. Characteristics When tire grip is good during road driving, a differential is used between the axles to avoid driveline windup. This is not required off-road, as the limited grip allows the tires to slip. All-wheel drive vehicles designed for extensive off-road use may not have such a differential, and so they suffer from wind-up when used on-road. Selectable 4WD also avoids this problem and requires only a simple dog clutch in the transfer case, rather than a differential. For this reason, most early off-road vehicles used that system; e.g., Jeep, Land Rover. As vehicles became more sophisticated and tires gave better winter performance in the 1960s there was an interest in giving the benefits of all-wheel drive to conventional cars; not for off-road use but for winter use in snow or on wet roads. Exotic vehicles such as the high-powered Jensen FF followed by the AMC Eagle, Subaru Leone and Audi Quattro series were the first to offer all-wheel drive in a high-speed road-based car. These, particularly the Quattro, would extensively develop this drivetrain with the use of viscous couplings and differentials to provide a safe and drivable car. The first off-road / on-road hybrids such as the Range Rover also chose the permanent all wheel drive system rather than manual selection. Selectable 4WD has both axles rigidly coupled together, which has some advantages in very poor off-road conditions. To gain the same advantage in a permanent AWD system with a differential, the differential can be locked manually with a differential lock. As this control is frequently misunderstood and mis-used, which can then cause damage due to wind-up, they have tended to be replaced by automatic locking through the viscous couplers.

They are mainly found in Malakal, South Sudan and inhabit the land along the confluences of the Nile and Sobat rivers. It is believed that the sub-tribe numbers about 95,000. They are devoted ethnics and believe in De≈ãdit as their provider. Some of Ngok sections are part of Bor Community and sections who identifies themselves as descendants of Ngok could still be traced!  History  In the 17th century, it was believed that the People of Ngokland (Ngok Lual Yak) came to the shore of River Nile from the other side of the Lower Nile. Moving from the west to the east, they came to control the region of the Upper Nile River, pushing out the Funj and Jur, the Achol Eliot (Acholi?). In the 18th century, with the arrival of the Nuer, Lual Yak together with his age- group and Ngok at large was forced to evacuate some areas, like Gaak-yuom in Bor, Jokou in Gajaak, Pakoop in Ayuaal, Pabiech in Kongoor and Piny-Wuut. They were pushed by the Nuer along the Sobat into the mouth of the Nile in Malakal. The Ngok Lual Yak became the owners of the land that runs from Malakal to Dome (D√∂m√´), Dini and Abwong (Ab…îÃà≈ã) Cheng Nyankiir along the River Sobat into the Nile at Malakal. The main borders with Nuer are Nyinrool as the border with Lou Nuer, Cuei on the side of Kurmiyom with Jikeny and Aboorbioong on the Lang-nom (Ulang) side and Nyinwak with Nuer Yom (Gajaak). The Ngokland people lived in two groups, namely Yom and Weny. Each group was further divided into sections and again into subsections. Ngok Lual Yak people owned NgokLand. They developed a skillful traditional culture and a close spiritual bond with the land. Early settlers were experts in hunting, fishing, farming, grazing and were skillful in spear and stick fighting. NgokLand ownership was by and for the people of Ngok Lual Yak.  People, land and early migration  Ngok Lual Yak as a group is an original Jieng Group. The Jieng began with the single family of Deng with his wife Abuk. One myth tells that Deng after his mythical death turned out to be an unreasonable phenomena, thus deriving the Jieng to worship Deng as commonly known today as Dengdit. Another myth explains that Deng is regarded as the main source that generate water. This caused the crops to grow. Facts about the Dengdit are yet to be known, but is akin to the Biblical story of Adam and Eve. Deng and Abuk are the twin marital progenitors of the Jieng Origin. Deng and Abuk are where Ngok People came from. Ngok Lual Yak as a tribe branched out of Jieng group and staked out its own historical line. Ngok Lual Yak converged into the following groups.  Ngok Lual Yak groups   Yom group  Tol *Awier *Baliet Yom *Duut *Balak *Dhiaak  Weny group  Paan Man Gok *Ajuba *Adong Paan Man Weny *Abiei *Ngaar *Achaak *Jook *Diing  Other Ngok groups  Ngok is part of the biggest chain of the other groups of Ngok like Ngok de Jook. Historically Ngok is an umbrella name for the different groups, including the NgokLand People of Ngok Lual Yak. Following are the other groups of Ngok. The following Ngok groups are either historically related or partly blood-related groups. Out of these groups, some are commonly known as the Pan Ayuel Jeel Family.  Earlier Ngok group, according to migration history   Ngok de Jok Group  *Ngok de Jok *nyok mathiang  Ruweeng  *Paanaruu *Aloor *Paweny  Dongjol  *Nyiel *Angaach *Ageer *Abilang *Padang Hol *Nyarweng  Marbek  *Hol *Luac *Duaar *Angaach *Rut & Thoi Ruweng are counted as independent Groups due to their population expansion but emerged from within Ngok.  People and land  Ngokland is an area on the Sobat river extending from Dome to Baliet and from Akoka to Renk on the eastern side of the White Nile including Melut and Paloc. More lived along the Sobat than along the Nile in Baliet. The civil wars of 1955 and 1983 affected their distribution. NgokLand sinclude Baliet, Dakjur (Adong), Tubuu, Gel Dhiaak, Abwong (Ab…îÃà≈ã), Gel Achol and to Dome (D√∂m√´) up to Abwong Cheng Nyankiir. The land features many broad tree lines and a pastoral grassland within the central area. Many tributaries divide the land. Most live on the western bank of the river. Traditionally, most of the western bank was the domain of influential NgokLand settlers. It is also the most olden prestigious heritage of the group.  Populations and resettlement  The exact Population number of Ngokland people of Ngok Lual Yak is not known, but was approximated at 80-95,000 in the 1950s.  Climate  Ngokland seasons are different to the southern hemispheres'. February, March late April are the hottest months and is called the summer season. The rainy season is from mid-May to the full month of October. And from August to earlier October is Autumn (not confirmed). Spring is from May to July (not confirmed). Winter is in early November, December to late January.  Government and politics   South Sudan National Government  The government of South Sudan has ten states and its headquarter in Juba. The SPLA/M ruling party is a formal rebel group. The party emerged after a civil war of 21 years. The leader is Salva Kiir Mayaardit, a Jieng. The SPLA/M held the majority in all 10 states as well as in the National Government. Under Salva Kiir, the Ngok Lual Yak have one MP in the National Government and many ranked Generals within the SPLA.  South Sudan State Government  Before November 2011, Ngokland people were represented at the state level of the Upper Nile. During the 2010 election, the representation of the Ngokland people dropped, leaving them no MP at the state level in Malakal.  Religion  The majority of people in Ngokland are Christians. Protestant Churches emerged in 1900. Among them is the Presbyterian Church of Sudan. Catholic and Trinity churches are present, plus non-believers who adhere to their traditional deeds.  Language or dialect  Jieng have a dialect. The Ngok Lual Yak speak in Jieng dialect. In the 1930s, a written form of Jieng was developed following the arrival of Europeans. Characters including ≈ã, NY, Y and NH were incorporated. Tho≈ã de Ji√´≈ã later became unintelligible due poor teaching. Earlier, Jieng was spoken on a regular basis and taught to children.  Currency  Before South Sudan seceded, the Dinar was in use in NgokLand. After South Sudan currency became available, the Dinar was phased out and the pound became the currency. The pound was available in 100 SSPd, 50 SSPd, 25 SSPd, 20SSPd, 10SSPd, 5SSpd and 1SSPd units.  Telecommunications  A Zain company operates the phone network. Zain offered regional, national and international call services.

Titanate nanosheets may be regarded as sheets with molecular thickness and infinite planar dimensions. TiNSs are typically formed via liquid-phase exfoliation of protonic titanate. In inorganic layered materials, individual layers are bound to each other by van der Waals interactions if they are neutral, and additional Coulomb interactions if they are composed of oppositely charged layers. Through liquid-phase exfoliation, these individual sheets of layered materials can be efficiently separated using an appropriate solvent, creating single-layer colloidal suspensions.M. Brown. Exfoliating layered materials. Feb. 2011. http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2011/February/03021103.asp Solvents must have an interaction energy with the layers that is greater than the interaction energy between two layers. In situ X-Ray diffraction data indicates that TiNSs can be treated as macromolecules with a sufficient amount of solvent in between layers so that they behave as individual sheets. A starting inorganic material composed of alternating layers of charged material, in the case of protonated titanate the cationic layer is composed of protons while the anionic layer is composed of edge linked TiO6 octahedra. A solvent is chosen such that it has a greater interaction energy with the sheets than they do with each other, and this interaction will replace the bonds holding the sheets together yielding colloidal suspensions of 2D nanosheets.  Properties Unilamellar TiNSs have a number of unique properties, and are said to combine those of conventional titanate and titania. Structurally, they are infinite ultrathin (~0.75 nm) 2D sheets with a high density of negative surface charges originating from the oxygen atoms at the corners of the adjoint octahedronsLiu, M., Y.

TiNSs may balance this anionic charge by inserting a counterionic layer between the two sheets either via layering or in aqueous solution.

Typically, titanium oxide suffers from oxygen vacancies, which diminish its potential as capacitors due to vacancies acting as high-leakage paths and charge carrier traps, however, TiNSs possess Ti vacancies, which promote channels for electron transfer. When Ti vacancies are present, the effective charge felt by electrons on oxygen atoms reduces and allows less hindered electron motion.Ohwada, Megumi, Koji Kimoto, Teruyasu Mizoguchi, Yasuo Ebina, and Takayoshi Sasaki. \\"Atomic Structure of Titania Nanosheet with Vacancies.\\" Scientific Reports (2013). Web. 1 Mar. 2015.  Applications  Cofacial Alignment of TiNSs. The cofacial alignment of the anionically charged titanate maximizes the repulsion between cofacial sheets and occurs under a magnetic field. TiNSs can act as highly efficient adsorbents and photocatalysts due to their two-dimensional geometry and structure. This phenomenon can be exploited for several applications, including the removal of metal ions and dyes from water systems. Further, TiNSs potential as an electrocatalyst may enhance fuel cell efficiency during fuel oxidation.Bavykin, Dmitry V., and Frank C.

TiNSs may also be used for immobilizing biomolecules. When a monolayer of hemoglobin is intercalated into TiNSs, the electron transfer between the active sites of the protein and the electrodes is amplified, and electrocatalytic activity for O2 reduction increases.Tao, H., J.

Print. Perhaps the most interesting application of TiNSs is in the development of a material dominated by electrostatically repulsive interactions. TiNSs exhibit maximum electrostatic repulsion when they are aligned cofacially. To create the hydrogel based on this, a solution of TiNSs is placed in a strong magnetic field where repulsive forces induce a quasi-crystalline structure. Upon irradiation with UV-light, the solution polymerizes and creates cross- linked network, which is non-covalently attached to the TiNSs. This creates a composite that resists orthogonally applied compressive forces, but easily deforms due to shear forces.RIKEN. \\"A repulsive material: New hydrogel dominated by electrostatic repulsion.\\" ScienceDaily.

The genus was first described in 2015 by Zanno et al., who named the binomial Carnufex carolinensis, meaning \\"Carolina butcher\\". Two specimens are known, the holotype skull and skeleton NCSM 21558, and the referred humerus NCSM 21623. The specimens are from the Carnian-age Pekin Formation, which dates to 231 million years ago. Based on the holotype, Carnufex would have been about long and tall, although it may have gotten larger due to the holotype not being fully grown. Discovery 3D visualization of holotype elements NCSM 21558 was discovered in a red fluvial conglomerate belonging to the mid-upper portion Pekin Formation of North Carolina, which formed in the Carnian age of the Late Triassic, around 231 million years ago. This specimen was described in a 2015 Scientific Reports article by Lindsay E. Zanno, Susan Drymala, Sterling J. Nesbitt, and Vincent P. Schneider. For the specimen and associated NCSM 21623, from the same level of the formation, they named the new binomial Carnufex carolinensis. This name is derived from the Latin word carnufex, for \\"butcher\\" and the location of the discovery in North Carolina. The holotype NCSM 21558 includes most regions of the skeleton: a partial skull (premaxilla, maxilla, lacrimal, and jugal), portions of the jaw (angular and articular), an atlantal intercentrum, neural arches from a cervical and dorsal vertebra, ribs, and an upper arm bone (humerus). A single referred specimen, NCSM 21623, is represented by part of a humerus, smaller than that of the holotype. The holotype and referred specimen were described in more detail by Drymala and Zanno in a 2016 PLOS One article. Description The size of the holotype specimen is difficult to assess, as the two most characteristic elements of the skeleton, the skull and the humerus, are proportionally unusual. Estimating body size from the skull predicts a much larger humerus, and estimating it from the humerus predicts a much smaller skull. This may indicate that the skull was unusually large, the forelimbs were unusually small, or both. Roughly scaling from local crocodylomorph taxa such as Dromicosuchus and an undescribed species (specimen NCSM 21722), Zanno et al. (2015) provided an estimated length of . However, it likely grew larger, as the holotype specimen was immature owing to the unossified neurocentral canals. Along with Redondavenator and CM 73372 (another undescribed species), Carnufex was among the largest Triassic crocodylomorphs. These three were among the earliest crocodylomorphs, casting doubt on the hypothesis that characteristic crocodylomorph features evolved after a reduction in body size, rather than before. Carnufex possesses a myriad of features characteristic of both crocodylomorphs and their more distant ancestors, reptiles like Postosuchus. However, it is also highly autapomorphic, meaning that it possessed many other features which are completely unique to it, distinguishing it from its close relatives. The skull was large, elongated, and heavily textured in some areas, while the forelimbs were small.  Skull  Maxilla of the holotype The low premaxilla possessed at least six teeth and a notch at the rear of the tooth row, similar to Dromicosuchus. Like other archosaurs, the premaxilla has a palatal process, an internally-oriented projection which forms the front of the palate (roof of the mouth). There is a conspicuous gap in this process which may have manifested as a small hole in the palate. This hole is also observed in certain other early crocodylomorphs, and it may accommodate an enlarged fourth tooth of the lower jaw. Premaxillary teeth are slender, serrated, and recurved. The maxilla has a long ascending process (upper branch) which remains a consistent height throughout its length. Other pseudosuchians either have a much shorter ascending process (early crocodylomorphs) or one which expands (rauisuchids) or tapers (more basal taxa) towards the rear. The posterior process (lower branch) of the maxilla is even longer, holding at least 15 teeth. Maxillary teeth are serrated and knife-like, with the front edge being significantly convex and the rear side being slightly convex. The posterior process is low and circular in cross-section at the front but deepens and thins towards the rear, a change in shape unique to Carnufex among loricatans. It also supports a sharp ridge which terminates at the rear lower corner of the antorbital fenestra. The antorbital fenestra itself takes the form of a very large and elongated triangular hole. Distinctly, the upper rear corner of the fenestra in Carnufex is situated above the lower rear corner, making the rear edge of the antorbital fenestra vertical rather than slanted forwards as in other early crocodylomorphs. The lacrimal is deeply incised by the antorbital fossa (the basin surrounding the antorbital fenestra). This fossa is rimmed by a rough ridge possessing a small but characteristic forward prong similar to that seen in some theropod dinosaurs. The outer surface of the jugal is also covered with pits and ridges. The anterior process (front portion) of the jugal is tall and unusually smooth and rounded in shape. The jugal's posterior process (rear branch) is bifurcated, with a large and tapering main portion and a smaller triangular branch forking up from it. A bifurcated posterior jugal is present in other early crocodylomorphs as well as dinosaurs, but in the latter group the two portions are equal in size, unlike the case with Carnufex. The angular is thin and slender, with subtle branched texturing. A pronounced ridge crops out at the outer rear portion of the bone. This ridge likely supports the pterygoideus ventralis muscle, although a similarly distinct ridge is rare among other crocodylomorphs, only known in Junggarsuchus. Otherwise, the angular is similar to that of Sphenosuchus. The articular is generally similar to that of other crocodylomorphs, with a saddle-shapped jaw facet, a deep groove for the chorda tympani nerve, and a small upwards projection at the rear of the bone. It also possesses a medial process (inwards branch) akin to that of earlier pseudosuchians like Postosuchus, although the medial process of Carnufex is a small, conical peak rather than a large projection.  Postcranium  The holotype (A-G) and referred (H-I) humeri of Carnufex The cervical neural arch is a complex bone adorned with nine laminae (plate-like ridges between various regions) and twelve fossae (deep pits between laminae). The neural spine is tall, rising a short distance before bending backwards at a 30 degree angle. The diapophyses (rib facets) are vertically extended and project laterally, though not very far. The rear edge of the postzygapophyses (rear articular processes) are thin and dip downwards, though they do not converge and instead their bases are separated by a small, U-shaped gap. Various other archosaurs have a similar postzygapophyseal projection, known as a hyposphene, though they differ from Carnufex in that their postzygapophyses converge at the base. Few early pseudosuchians preserve enough of the atlas to properly compare with the crescent-shaped atlantal intercentrum of Carnufex. The dorsal neural arch is similar to that of the cervical, with a few differences. The diapophyses are much shorter and the zygapophyses are more level. The dorsal is also less complex than the cervical, with only a few laminae and fossae. These include a less prominent \\"hyposphene\\", possibly an intermediate stage between reptiles like Postosuchus, which has a prominent hyposphene in its dorsals, and crocodylomorphs, which lack such a structure entirely. The neural spine is slightly expanded anteroposteriorly at its tip, like non-crocodylomorphs, but it does not have a spine table (lateral expansion). An asymmetrical extension visible from the underside of the neural arch may be a pathological feature. Preserved ribs are similar to those of other paracrocodylomorphs. The humerus was short, with a constricted shaft. It was more similar to Postosuchus than it was to other crocodylomorphs, as a result of several features. These include a distal end approximately three times as wide as the shaft (as opposed to two times as wide), and the presence of an ectepicondylar groove and supinator process (which are not present in other crocodylomorphs). There is also a unique characteristic present in Carnufex but absent in all of its relatives, that being a pronounced crest forming the rear edge of the ectepicondylar groove. Classification Carnufex is a primitive crocodylomorph, a group including suchians more derived than Rauisuchidae. It is the most basal of the group, along with an unnamed genus. Zanno et al. (2015) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, including taxa as basal as Mesosuchus and as derived as Protosuchus and Alligator. Holotype elements Below is a simplified version of their cladogram, including only Loricata and Crocodylomorpha. Paleoecology The Pekin Formation is a Late Triassic deposit in Deep River Basin of North and South Carolina, which dates from the Carnian about 231 million years ago. The formation is the oldest in the Chatham Group. The locality of Carnufex is in a boulder field, and the rock facies suggest that the region once represented a channel or alluvial deposit. In the Carnian, the formation would have been 2¬∫ north of the equator. Many fauna from the Pekin Formation await formal description. The fauna include a new aetosaur, Carnufex and another crocodylomorph, an unnamed traversodont formerly assigned to Boreogomphodon, and a new dicynodont. Although Carnufex was the largest carnivore in its ecosystem known from fossils, this may be a result of sampling bias obscuring the distribution of larger animals like rauisuchids. As a result, its describers hesitated from identifying Carnufex as the apex predator of its environment, instead proposing that it may be part of a large predator \\"guild\\" that inhabited the area.

The figure in the painting has been identified as the Viscount Goderich, who briefly served as British Prime Minister between August 1827 and January 1828.

Pan-American Conference of Women occurred in Baltimore, Maryland, US in 1922. It was held in connection with the third annual convention of the National League of Women Voters in Baltimore on April 20 to 29, 1922. Cooperating with the League in bringing the Pan American Women's conference to the United States were the US Secretary of State, Charles Evans Hughes, the US Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, and Dr. Leo Stanton Rowe, Director General of the Pan American Union (PAU). The conference was meant to strengthen and carry a step forward the initiative undertaken at the Second Pan American Scientific Congress, when a woman's auxiliary committee was formed to develop closer cooperation between the women of the American continent. The countries who accepted the invitation to be present at the Conference and who sent delegates, were: Argentine, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chili, Cuba, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, United States, Uruguay and Venezuela. The foreign delegates who attended the Congress were carefully chosen and were not political appointments but represented the most progressive and brilliant women in their countries. The foreign delegates represented 32 countries and two Provinces of Canada. There were in addition 23 delegates from foreign organizations, eight personal delegates from foreign countries, and a number of personal delegates from the US. The business or arrangement of the Pan- American Conference was achieved largely through the cooperation of the ambassadors from the Pan-American nations. The delegates were met at various points throughout the US until their arrival in Baltimore. The sessions were held in Baltimore's Roof Garden of the Century Theatre and in the ballroom of the Belvedere Hotel. During the sessions, all the delegates sat upon the platform under the respective banners of their countries. The large Conference Hall was decorated with the flags of all the nations represented. Many of the foreign delegates spoke in Spanish and their speeches were interpreted; one or two spoke in French and a few in English. Background Lady Nancy Astor, guest speaker (right) The invitations to the governments of South and Central American countries to send delegates to this conference were forwarded through the US State Department and its diplomatic representatives in the Republics of Latin America. While not an official invitation from the Government of the US, the plan received the sanction and approval of administration officials, who viewed these types of conferences favorably, as they would promote a better understanding and more friendly relations between the citizens of the various countries. The main purpose of this conference, according to Maud Wood Park, national president of the League of Women Voters, was to bring the women of the US into more friendly relations with the women of South America, Central America, Mexico, and Canada. Baltimore was selected as the next convention city of the PAU at the national convention which occurred in April 1921 at Cleveland, Ohio, this being on the joint invitation of the Maryland League of Women Voters, the State of Maryland through Governor Albert C. Ritchie, and the city of Baltimore through Mayor William Frederick Broening. Rowe concurred with the suggestion of the Maryland League of Women Voters that a Pan American conference of women would carry on and strengthen the friendly relations and good will between women of the countries represented by the PAU, the foundations for which were laid by the Woman's Auxiliary Committee of the Second Pan American Scientific Conference of December‚ÄìJanuary, 1915-16. In making plans for the conference, the National League of Women Voters consulted with Hughes, Hoover, and Rowe who approved. The plans were first presented to Hughes and Hoover by a delegation consisting of Park, Madeleine Lemoyne Ellicott, Matilda Backus Maloy, and Lavinia Engle, representing the Maryland League of Women Voters; Gov. Ritchie; Henry G. Perring, representing the State of Maryland; and W. M. Brittain, representing the city of Baltimore. Upon its approval by the Cabinet officers, the plan was laid before the Baltimore Board of Trade by the league, receiving their endorsement. The League of Women Voters believed that very definite results could be achieved through round-table conferences. Women everywhere were recognizing the necessity of raising the standards for women in industry, of securing legislation that would guard the civil rights of women, and of protecting in every possible way those who need protection. To this end it was fitting to discuss the best means to the desired end, and that the participants would have an opportunity to help one another through conference and consultation. Park said that women were instinctively ready to work together for the things that they wished to accomplish, because their interests were cooperative rather than competitive. \\"Women's distinctive interests are in common‚Äî home making, children, general welfare‚Äîwhereas men's distinctive interests are sometimes of necessity conflicting and have to be settled by compromise. There is nothing about the ordinary occupations of women which is competitive. To illustrate, if the women of one nation are able to secure a child-welfare measure, and to develop and improve their work along these lines, their step in advance is a help and not a hindrance to the women of all other nations. The occupations and interests of women are the occupations and interests of peace, and lend themselves readily to cooperation.\\" Program The program was divided into six conference sessions, two being held each day: *Child Welfare: Grace Abbott, Chief of Children's Bureau, United States Department of Labor, presiding; assisted La Rue Brown, Chairman of Committees on Child Welfare, National League of Women Voters *Education: Julia Abbot, Bureau of Education, United States Department of Interior, presiding, assisted by Marian Kinney Brookings, Chairman of Committee on American Citizenship, National League *Women in Industry: Mary Anderson, Chief of the Women's Bureau, United States Department of Labor, presiding, assisted by Mary McDowell, Chairman of Committee on Women in Industry, National League *Prevention of Traffic in Women: Dr. Valeria H. Parker, Executive Secretary United States Interdepartmental Social Hygiene Board, presiding, assisted by Ann Webster, Chairman of Committee on Social Hygiene, National League *Civil Status of Women: Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Assistant Attorney General, United States Department of Justice, presiding, assisted by Catherine Waugh McCulloch, Chairman of Uniform Laws concerning Women, National League *Political Status of Women: Carrie Chapman Catt, President International Suffrage Alliance, presiding. April 20th The conference was opened on the morning of April 20 with an invocation delivered by Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley. Addresses of welcome followed by the Governor of Maryland and the Mayor of Baltimore. Park presided. Rowe was the first speaker on the regular program, and was followed by the various foreign delegates, each of whom reported briefly. The afternoon session was devoted to subjects pertaining to education and was presided over by Julia Abbott, of the United States Bureau of Education. April 21st The subject of the second day began with \\"Women in Industry,\\" at which speeches were made by the delegates, Mary McDowell and Mrs. Raymond Robins of Chicago. At the request of Anderson, a summing up was made by the delegate from the US, who also emphasized the standards for the protection of working women in this country and urged the delegates to work for similar protective legislation. The afternoon was devoted to a session on, the \\"Prevention of Traffic in Women,\\" presided over by Parker, at which speeches were made by several government officials and all the delegates. This session was again closed by the delegate from the US, who urged greater supervision of commercialized amusements for young people and the extension of constructive programs of wholesome recreation. April 22nd The third day was presided over by Willebrandt and was devoted to discussion of the Civil Status of Women. Speeches were made by an alderwoman from Toronto and Dr. Margaret Patterson, a police magistrate from the Province of Ontario. The afternoon session was on the Political Status of Women and was presided over by Catt, the honorary president of the National League of Women Voters, the first speech being made by the official delegate from the US, who urged women to run for office, join political parties, and take an active part in the political life of the nation. Discussions At each of these conferences, brief reports on conditions in their respective countries were made by the delegates from foreign countries and the one delegate representing the US, Louise DeKoven Bowen, appointed by President Harding. A visiting delegate from Poland paid a high tribute to the participation of the United States in the work of the great World War. In her own words, \\"Were it not for the American Red Cross, there would probably not be alive in Poland today, a single child.\\" The delegate from Argentina contrasted the objective of international organizations of men with that of women's organizations. \\"Not commerce, which men have called the blood of nations, nor any other material consideration,\\" she said, \\"but international peace, permanent peace, is the ultimate objective of international conferences of women, such as the PanAmerican Conference.\\" In the conference on Traffic in Women, a hopeful note was sounded by the delegate from Panama, who presented clearly and in forceful terms, the spiritual aspect of the problem. Again at this conference Graciela Mandujano, of Chile, a student at Columbia University, spoke of the White Cross League, organized by women of her nation for protective work among girls. A high water mark in progress was reported by Aurora Herrera de N√≥bregas, of the State of Tamaulipas, Mexico, with its budget of $3,000,000 for education. Shower baths, medical attention and play grounds are a part of the equipment of the schools. Another Mexican delegate reported 1,000 free beds for maternity service in Mexico City. All delegates with the exception of Maria Clotilde Voga, of Nicaragua, stressed the importance of government aid in child welfare work. She said, in part, \\"We do not need state legislation to take care of children. The women of my country without such aid, are sponsoring day nurseries, schools of hygiene, and schools for special care of children.\\" Matilde de Carbo said: \\"It is almost a disgrace in Ecuador to have less than six children in a family, and often there are a dozen.\\" She outlined legislation projected by women of her country. Eighty-nine foreign newspapers in 15 countries requested current reports for publication. Resolution The tree planting ceremony on the grounds of the Pan American Union, April 28, 1922. Conferences were held by groups of the foreign delegates with national leaders of the US for the purpose of organizing a permanent Pan-American Association of Women. This objective was finally achieved when at the Belvedere Hotel, on April 27, the organization meeting of the Pan-American Association of Women was held, at which Park was elected president. To quote from some of the women leaders; in the words of Catt: \\"It is undoubtedly one of the achievements of the age. A handful of women thoroughly awakened to the possibilities for educational and civic improvement, are sufficient to arouse the interest and attention of all with whom they come into contact. In fact, they cannot fail to do so. Bringing together a few women from the three Americas at a time when questions of paramount importance to women have been the topics of discussion by leaders of the woman movement, has been the beginning of a movement to establish unity between the women of the two continents. I regard the Pan-American Conference and the establishment of a permanent organization as an entering wedge. It may seem to have started with very few women, but I am confident that these women will see far-reaching effects.\\" \\"The permanent organization,\\" said Bertha Lutz, of Brazil, \\"is the natural and necessary outcome of the Pan-American Conference. I believe that it will cement the friendship which exists between the two continents and will keep the peace. It will make possible co-operation between women of the two Americas and will enable them to learn from each other the best things which are being done for women and for children. It is decidedly a progressive step for all women.\\" The comment of Ester Neira De Calvo, of Panama, was as follows: \\"I think that the future holds for us an opportunity to work with the League of Women Voters for the realization of ideals, common to the women of both North and South America.\\" Dr. Bedrich Stepanek, Minister from Czechoslovakia, made a plea for an international association of women. Following the completion of the meetings of the Pan- America Conference, practically all of the foreign delegates remained in Baltimore as the guests of the Convention of the National League of Women Voters. The direct result of the meeting was the formation of a permanent Pan- American Association, with these officers: honorary president, Catt; president, Park; honorary vice-president, Dr. Paulina Luisi of Uruguay; vice- presidents, Elena Torres of Mexico, Ester Niera De Calvo of Panama, and Lutz of Brazil; secretary, Maria Suarez De Coronado of Colombia; treasurer, Olga Capurro De Varela of Uruguay. There was an advisory committee with a representative from each of the 22 countries sending delegates to the conference. The aims of the Association were: \\"To promote general education among all women and to secure for them higher standards of education; to secure the rights of married women to control their own property and their own wages; to secure equal guardianship; to encourage organization, discussion and public speaking among women, and freedom of opportunity for all women to cultivate and use all their talents; to educate public opinion'in favor of granting the vote to women and secure their political rights; and to promote friendliness and understanding among the Pan-American countries to the end that there may be perpetual peace in the western hemisphere.\\" Latin America attendees From left: Carmen de Pinillos (Peru), Pastoriza Flores (Ecuador), Mrs. C. de Veyra (Philippines), Mrs. Jacobo Valera (Uruguay) Berta Lutz Sadie Lewis Adams The Latin American members of the conference included: *Argentina, Sra. de Le Breton; Bolivia, Sra.

He was probably educated in Rome under Piero della Francesca (frescoes in the d'Estouteville chapel in S.Maria Maggiore, 1459). In 1464-66 ca. he frescoed the chapel (Stories of Christ) and loggia (Illustrious Men) in the Orsini Palace at Tagliacozzo, at the service of the brother dukes Napoleone and Roberto Orsini. In 1468-69 he frescoed with Stories of the Virgin the Mazzatosta Chapel in the Servite Church of Santa Maria della Verit√† in Viterbo: the Marriage of the Virgin is an extraordinary, animated portrait of notable contemporary citizens of Viterbo. The frescoes were nearly destroyed during World War II, and have been painstakingly restored. Lorenzo was in Florence in 1473: his protector, the Sienese Cardinal Jacopo Ammannati Piccolomini, recommended the artist to Lorenzo il Magnifico in a letter written from his villa in Monsindoli in the vicinity of Siena.

Its original name was simply the Administration Building while the university itself was using the name under which it first organized, Oregon State Agricultural College. It is situated on a gentle slope called \\"College Hill\\" just west of the city's commercial center on the west bank of the Willamette River, and there anchors the rest of the school's remaining original buildings on the \\"Lower Campus\\" (given with current names and years built): Apperson Hall (1899), Benton Annex (1892), Education Hall (1902) and Gladys Valley Gymnastics Center (1898).  History  1860 saw a lien placed on the first building to occupy the site, by a carpenter who had not been paid for his work. The ensuing sheriff's sale resulted in ownership of the building, the land and the school operating there (Corvallis College) by Rev. Orceneth Fisher on behalf of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, to which he was pastor. By 1885, calls from local leaders were growing loud to convert it to a state institution which would be eligible for Federal funds under the Land Grant program and the church agreed to relinquish control. With In response, the Oregon State Legislature passed an act that reorganized the school as the state's agricultural college, but skeptical of the actual awarding of Land-grant status decided to require the citizens of Benton County to bear the full costs for the construction of a suitable building to house its offices, which the act stated could be no less than $25,000 (equivalent to ~$675,000 in 2019) though if successful the building would become property of the state upon completion. The 1880 census had reported only ~1,400 households within the entire county, but less than two years later the sum had been raised, permits secured and construction began on the Administration Building still standing largely unchanged today as Community Hall. ‚ÄùThe building's cornerstone was laid by the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Oregon on August 17, 1887. It opened in September 1889. On Oct. 28, 1987, Governor Neil Goldschmidt signed a proclamation declaring the day as \\"Benton Hall Day\\". Benton Hall was renamed Community Hall in November 2017.

She was one of the first females to work in the field of Mexican archeology. She was the lead investigator of the remains found in Ixcateopan, Guerrero, which she alleged to be those of the last Aztec Emperor, Cuauht√©moc. Three boards of inquiry on the archeological work done at the site refuted Guzm√°n's findings, calling her field methods into question. Her lasting legacy was the collection of Mexico's history from archives throughout the world and creation of the National Library of Anthropology and History. Biography Eulalia Guzm√°n Barr√≥n was born 12 February 1890 in San Pedro Piedra Gorda, in the Cuauht√©moc Municipality, Zacatecas, Mexico. When she was eight years old, her family moved to Mexico City. From an early age, Guzm√°n rejected the idea that women were destined for domesticity and was determined to become a teacher. She was awarded a grant to study at the Normal School for Teachers and graduated in 1910. Socialist schooling methods introduced in Mexico at this time from Spain radicalized many teachers of the era. From 1909 to 1914, Guzm√°n served as Assistant for the Normal School. In 1906 she co-founded Admiradoras de Ju√°rez (Fans of Ju√°rez) with Hermila Galindo, Laura N. Torres, and Luz Vera to agitate for women's suffrage. Guzm√°n, working with Herminia √Ålvarez Herrera, Mar√≠a Arias Bernal, and Dolores Sotomayor founded the Corregidor de Quer√©taro Vocational School to help women improve their economic circumstances. When President Francisco I. Madero was captured, Guzm√°n and Arias attempted a meeting with coup leader, Victoriano Huerta, to plea for the life of the president and his vice president. The school closed upon the assassination of Madero and the women agitated for the Constitutionalists through the Club Feminil Lealtad (Women's Loyalty Club). Political involvement resulted in Guzman's firing from Miguel Lerdo de Tejada School but she quickly got work teaching classes at Fournier High School. Her educational background spurred the Constitutionalists to send Guzm√°n to the United States in 1921 to investigate schools there. While in the US, Guzm√°n, along with Elena Torres and Julia Nava de Ruis√°nchez represented the Mexican Feminist Council at the 1922 League of Women Voters convention in Baltimore, and the Pan-American Conference of Women. Returning to Mexico, she taught in a rural primary school in B√°cum designed for Yaqui education and also ran a night school for adults. Between 1923 and 1924, she returned to Mexico City and served as the director of the national illiteracy campaign. From 1926-1929, Guzm√°n studied school organizational techniques in Europe, traveling to Switzerland and Germany. Back in Mexico, she obtained a master's degree in philosophy in 1933, from the School of Advanced Studies at UNAM. She participated in the excavation of Tomb 7 of Monte Alb√°n in 1933 with Alfonso Caso and in 1934 was one of the first to study the pre-Columbian site of Chalcatzingo. She was appointed to serve as the Director of the Department of Archaeology of the National Museum in 1934 and two years later was commissioned to visit museums and libraries in Europe and the US in search of documentation on Mexican history. She studied and traveled until 1940 creating a cataloged record of more than 3 thousand documents which were placed in the custody of Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) (National Institute of Anthropology and History). Guzman created the historical archive of the Biblioteca Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (BNAH) (National Library of Anthropology and History). In 1942 she explored the archaeological sites of Izapa and Comit√°n in Chiapas and her own birthplace, San Pedro Piedra Gorda. Guzm√°n was appointed to head the historical archives of INAH in 1944 and held that position until her retirement in 1968. During this time she was studying and graduated in 1945 with a degree in archeology, working on a film project on Latin America with Walt Disney Studios, and excavating sites in Chachoapam, Nochistl√°n, Tamazulapan, Teposcolula and Yanhuitl√°n. In 1949, Guzm√°n was sent to investigate reports that the remains of the Aztec Emperor, Cuauht√©moc had been found in the village of Ixcateopan, Guerrero. She died on 1 January 1985 in Mexico City. Guzm√°n examined the documents purporting to have been from a Franciscan priest and believing them to be authentic began an excavation of the main church at Ixcateopan. She discovered bones which she declared to belong to Cuauht√©moc. Initially scholars congratulated Guzm√°n, but after an examination was conducted by INAH to confirm the findings, Guzm√°n's authentication was rejected. Public outcry brought prominent citizens of the indigenismo movement, including Diego Rivera and others, to support Guzman's conclusions that the bones in the ossuary were authentic. The Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) empaneled a \\"Grand Commission\\" composed of some of Mexico's most prominent scholars including Arturo Arn√°iz y Freg, Alfonso Caso, Manuel Gamio, Jos√© G√≥mez Robleda and Manuel Toussaint for a second review. Their findings concluded the documents were forged, the bones were recent, and they reprimanded Guzm√°n for her methods. Guzm√°n and others published numerous articles to refute the findings of the commission. The intellectual and scholarly community divided into the camp that supported Guzman and the camp that did not. In an effort to finally put the controversy to an end, a fourth commission was established in 1976 by president Luis Echeverr√≠a. Guillermo Bonfil Batalla, general director of INAH, assembled archeologists, architects, anthropologists, forensic examiners, and historians, who evaluated the archeological materials, re-excavated the site and re-examined the documentation. Their conclusions mirrored previous findings that the bones and claims were a hoax. Guzm√°n's loss of impartiality, though condemned by academia, did not dampen her popularity with native populations, who have honored her with festivals and renamed the town square in her honor.

She was a member of the Stolen Generations, which were Aboriginal children forcibly removed from their families by the Australian government. Her story was the inspiration for the book Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, and the film Rabbit-Proof Fence. Early life Molly Craig was born in Jigalong, Western Australia circa 1917. Her mother, Maude was a Martu Aboriginal woman, and her father was Thomas Craig, a white Australian fence inspector. The Martu people (Mardudjara) had moved from the nearby Sandy Desert. Jigalong was established in the far north west of Australia in 1907, as the location for a maintenance and rations store for workmen constructing the rabbit-proof fence. The rabbit-proof fence is a pest- exclusion fence constructed between 1901 and 1907 to keep rabbits and other agricultural pests, from the east, out of Western Australian pastoral areas. In the first part of the 20th century, children of mixed Indigenous and white parentage were frequently removed from their families and placed in institutions or with white families as domestic servants. In 1931, Molly (probably 14), her half-sister Daisy (aged about 11) and her cousin Gracie (aged about 8) were taken from their families and transported over 1600kms to the Moore River Native Settlement, north of Perth. The next day, the three girls escaped on foot, and walked to find the rabbit-proof fence and then follow it north back to Jigalong. Molly 'piggy-backed' the younger girls in turn. The journey was described in the book Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence by Molly's daughter Doris Pilkington Garimara. In 2002, the book was made into a film, Rabbit-Proof Fence, directed by Phillip Noyce.  Later life  Molly married Toby Kelly, an Aboriginal stockman, and the couple worked on Balfour Downs station. Molly gave birth to her first daughter, Nugi Garimara (Doris), in 1936 under a wintamarra (mulga) tree and cut the umbilical cord with a butcher's knife. In 1937, her second daughter Annabelle was born. Molly was taken to the Moore River settlement again in 1940 with her daughters. She ran away in 1941, carrying 18-month-old Annabelle. She left Doris (4) with a relative. In 1943, Annabelle (Anna Wyld) was taken away from Molly and told she was an orphan. She would never see her mother again, although they were able to exchange gifts before Molly's death. Doris was reunited with her mother 21 years later which led to her internationally acclaimed and award- winning trilogy, Caprice, A Stockman's Daughter, (UQP, 1991), Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, (UQP, 1996), and Under the Wintamarra Tree, (UQP, 2002). The children's edition of Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence was Home to Mother, (UQP, 2006). Molly died in her sleep in January 2004, at Jigalong, Western Australia, at about 87 years old.

Both films were released together on a single reel on January 10, 1911. Everybody Saves Father is a comedy focusing on a father whose life is planned to be saved by a succession of his daughter's suitors. The plan of each of the three men work, foiling the attempts of the other, but a four suitor has wed the daughter whilst the scheming was done by the others. The Only Girl in Camp is a drama film focusing on the only girl in a mining town who foils an armed robbery with the use of bear traps. In 2009, The Only Girl in Camp was identified and deposited into the Library of Congress for preservation. The only known credits for the production come from film stills from the film. The reviews for Everybody Saves Father were positive, but The Only Girl in Camp was met with more or less neutral reception.  Plots  The official synopsis for both films was published in The Moving Picture World on January 14, 1911. The first film, Everybody Saves Father is focused on Jennie Gear, a young woman whose affections are sought by many men. Jennie's father thinks his daughter is too young to be married and drives off four of her suitors. One of the men, John, concocts a plan to save his life to win the man's approval. The plan is heard by another suitor, George, who decides to hire a rowboat to save the old man himself. This is over heard by George who concocts his own rescue to foil George. The plans go through without failure as each successive suitor's plan works to the actions of the other, and Henry wins the approval of Jennie's father. However, Jennie had already married Bill in the meantime. The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, focuses on Trapper Gates's daughter, who is the only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians come across the camp and plan to rob the miners. The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he will give a lecture on locating gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.  Cast and production  Film historian Q. David Bowers does not cite credits for Everybody Saves Father. Though Bowers does not cite credits for The Only Girl in Camp, the rediscovered film and identification of film stills have provided credit for Frank H. Crane, William Garwood, Violet Heming and Tom Fortune. The other cast credits are unknown, but many Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The writer of the scenarios was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions though cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Alfred H. Moses, Jr. and Carl Louis Gregory.  Release and reception  Everybody Saves Father and The Only Girl in Camp were released together on a single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on January 10, 1911. The total length of Everybody Saves Father is approximately 450 feet long and the Only Girl in Camp is 480 feet long. Though both films were on a split reel, sometimes the films were advertised independently or listed Everybody Saves Father only. Theaters showing the one or possibly both films are known in North Carolina Indiana, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and California. A surviving nitrate print of The Only Girl in Camp was sold on eBay in 2009. The film was purchased and deposited in the Library of Congress for preservation. Everybody Saves Father was met with positive reviews in the trade publications. The Billboard review stated, \\"The comedy is distinctively American and makes a good subject. The photography is excellent and the acting clever.\\" The Moving Picture World affirmed that it was a good lively and laughable comedy. The two reviews were also backed by The New York Dramatic Mirrors positive review of the comedy production. The publications would also review The Only Girl in Camp were more or less neutral, but The Billboard highlighted how the prop traps could not believably work and hold a man as they did in the film. The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for the novelty of the production without any criticism.

He wrote nine books and dozens of letters and op-ed essays for the New York Times, the Washington Post, and regional papers. He gave an invocation for a national audience at the 1924 Democratic National Convention. Prior to the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, he strongly opposed going to war against Nazi Germany. Early life and education Kinsolving was born in Halifax, Virginia, the son of the Rev. Ovid Americus Kinsolving (1822-1894)(who had worked in Middleburg, Virginia during the American Civil War and been imprisoned for his Confederate oratory) and his third wife. Three of his half brothers also became clergymen; his half-brother George Herbert Kinsolving became the Episcopal bishop of Texas. Wythe Leigh Kinsolving received an M.A. degree from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va., in 1902, and a B.D. degree from Virginia Theological Seminary, Alexandria, Va., in 1906. That same year, he married Annie Laurie Pitt, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Robert Healy Pitt, editor-in-chief of a leading Southern Baptist periodical, the Religious Herald.Stowe's Clerical Directory of the American Church 1920-21 (biographial listing of Episcopal clergy). Minneapolis: Andrew David Stowe, 1920 Career and politics In 1906, he became rector at Church of the Epiphany in Barton Heights, Richmond, Va., but resigned this position two years later. In December 1908, newspapers around the country reported that Kinsolving had confronted his father-in-law over questions the latter raised about his mental health, that the two ministers had a fist fight, and that he had resigned the Epiphany pulpit as a result.\\"MINISTERS COME TO BLOWS: Rev.

They have been a puzzle for long and have been the subject of many conjectures and scientific studies. They are believed to be of ritual significance and produced by early pastoral and agricultural communities by the burning of wood, dung and animal matter. Hundreds of ashmound sites have been identified and many have a low perimeter embankment and some have holes that may have held posts. These ashmounds were traditionally given mythological explanations as the burnt remains of rakshasas described in epics like the Mahabharata. A scientific explanation was first attempted by T. J. Newbold who sent notes on B≈´digunta, one of the largest such mounds, to James Prinsep who published it in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1836. Newbold suggested that these were volcanic scoriae as the masses had a glassy surface and gave a hollow sound when struck. He was initially of the opinion that it appeared as if of volcanic origin although lacking any other evidence for it. He also pointed out that furnaces around the country did not produce such scoriae or slag. Newbold also pointed to Buchanan Hamilton's notes on the Rajmahal hills where he had described calcareous remains that the locals referred to as asurhar or giant's bones. Cavelly Venkata Lachmia (one of Colin Mackenzie's fellow researchers and president of the Madras Hindu Literary Society) wrote to Newbold that he had gathered theories these were remains of religious sacrifices made in the past or from funerals of past battles. Lachmia also pointed out that he had seen many other places around Mysore and many of these other places like Budihal and Buditippa had the prefix b≈´di referring to \\"ash\\". Budigunta near Bellary was said to be the largest and recorded as being 46 feet in height and 420 feet in circumference. Robert Sewell conjectured that the region was once densely forested and considered several possible explanations including furnaces. He also had the material examined and it was declared that it could not have come from furnaces or brick kilns. The burning of animal matter was considered as one possible source. He also pointed out that these could have been the result of large pyres where the wives of kings committed sati. Robert Bruce Foote examined Budikanama in 1872 and suggested that these mounds were produced by burning dung and suggested a similarity to zaribas in Africa. Around the same time two amateur archaeologists dug a mound in Kupgal and found bones, pottery, stone axes and other artefacts. Allchin in 1963 made an analysis of all the theories and pointed out that rainfall was higher in the region during the Neolithic and that these may been forested regions which were burnt down for livestock. Archaeological studies have continued into recent times. Some of the plant remains have been identified and millet cultivation may have been important. Two staple millets Brachiaria ramosa and Setaria verticillata which are not common in modern cultivation were found in several sites while the commonest legumes were Vigna radiata and Macrotyloma uniflorum. The animal remains are mainly of cattle, buffalo and pig (whether wild or domesticated, is not easy to determine).

CO-ADD's goal is to find new, diverse compounds to combat the superbug crisis in screening chemical compounds for antimicrobial activity against key ESKAPE pathogens, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus (MRSA), as well as the fungi C. neoformans and C. albicans. CO-ADD is supported by the Wellcome Trust through a Strategic Award and The University of Queensland (Institute for Molecular Bioscience), where the compound screening facilities are located.  Community  CO-ADD is a community-driven solution to the superbug crisis problem providing chemists with: * an open access antimicrobial drug discovery platform * a low-barrier access to free antimicrobial screening * a program to uncover and test chemical diversity sitting on chemists‚Äô shelves * a communal knowledge base for antimicrobial discovery  The Superbug Crisis  Resistance of bacteria to commonly used antibiotics is increasing and contributes significantly to patient morbidity and mortality. Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, together with the gram-positive Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus are responsible for two-thirds of all health care-associated infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared antimicrobial resistance to be one of the greatest threats to human health. On World Health Day 2011, themed ‚Äòcombating antimicrobial resistance‚Äô, WHO issued an international call for concerted action to halt the spread of antimicrobial resistance, launching a six-point policy package, recommended for governments, which sets out the measures governments and their national partners need to combat drug resistance.

Lane's first exhibition was at the Phillips Memorial Gallery in 1931. Lane created figure subjects, portraits, and landscapes executed in watercolor and oil. Her work includes nature and street scenes in the Americas and Europe, domestic scenes, and grotesques. Lane's work is included in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Phillips Collection, the Provincetown Art Association and Museum, and the Cape Cod Museum of Art. Life Born in Washington, D.C. on 30 Sept 1907, Betty (born Elizabeth Thoburn) Lane was the youngest of six children born to a Marine officer, Rufus Herman Lane and Gertrude Eleanor Mills. Lane began painting in watercolor around age 9. After high school Lane enrolled at the Corcoran College of Art and Design. Unhappy at Corcoran, she transferred to the Massachusetts Normal Art School.  Career  In 1928 Lane traveled to Paris and studied with Andr√© Lhote. In 1929 Lane returned to the United States, living in Falls Church, Virginia and Washington, D.C. It was during this period that Lane's work came to the attention of Duncan Phillips. In April 1931 Lane was part of an exhibition at the Phillips Memorial Gallery with John Marin and Harold Weston. Between 1930 and 1939 Lane lived in Cambridge, England and Paris, France. From 1939 to 1946 Lane was living in Ontario, Canada. In 1946 Lane moved to the United States, teaching at Miss Porter's School from 1952 until 1965.

He is a member of OBH (Original Block Hustlaz), the label and rap supergroup he co-founded with fellow rapper Dark Lo. Complex named him one of \\"15 Unsigned Rappers Who Should Get a Deal After SXSW\\" in March 2013, the same year he turned himself in to authorities following legal trouble. He signed with Cash Money Records in May 2016. OBH members have included: Dark Lo, Lik Moss, Shamoney \\"Da Wolf\\", p90 smooth, Breeze Begets, Pretty Flock, Skinny me, Newz, Cdot, Razor, Kylledge, NoBrakes Bras, Young Mir, Wiz Lo & others.  Music career  Abdul West was born on September 26, 1982 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. West began his career as a battle rapper and went on to become a member of Cassidy's Larsiny Family, appearing as a featured artist on his mixtapes throughout 2007, namely 07-07-07 (Happy Birthday) and Put Ya L In The Sky. He continued working features for artists during this time until the release of his debut mixtape Welcome to Trap Street on May 1, 2008. In 2008, West and Cassidy appeared on the Cocaine City street DVD, where the two collaborated on \\"City of Dreams\\" alongside a young French Montana. This would be Ab's first music video before concentrating on his solo career. He released his second mixtape I See Dead People on January 8, 2009, and his third mixtape Allegheny AB on May 26, 2010. West began making waves following the release of his fourth mixtape Who Harder Than Me, released on February 13, 2011. In 2012, West began working on his fifth mixtape Who Harder Than Me II, which was released on October 5, 2012. The record included features from fellow Philadelphia rapper Freeway, and New York rapper and producer Swizz Beatz who had previously worked with Cassidy during the latter's stint with Ruff Ryders Entertainment. The collaboration, during which Swizz Beatz referred to Ab as \\"most important new artist in rap\\", prompted speculation whether he would be signed to his label. The following year saw the release of his sixth mixtape MUD Musik on February 28, 2013. This would be his last release before his latest round of legal trouble which saw West turning himself into authorities and incarcerated in March of that same year.  Personal life  West grew up in North Philadelphia, where he currently resides. In late 2010, West and Dark Lo formed their label and rap collective OBH (Original Block Hustlaz), which also includes his brother Lik Moss among other rappers. In 2012, West's grandmother died and his mother died the following month. He describes this as a traumatic moment in his life, having already lost an elder brother prior.  Legal issues  West has been embroiled in a spate of legal issues throughout his career, and prior to his involvement in the music industry, including charges related to drug trafficking, possession, and violent crimes. According to interviews, he has served time in jail on four separate occasions prior to his most-recent 2013 sentencing related to crack cocaine. West, along with 8 others, has been indicted in connection with a drug trafficking group in North Philadelphia. = 2005 homicide case = In 2005, West was one of three men wanted by police in connection to an April 15 shooting that left one man dead and two others injured. Prominent rapper Cassidy was the main suspect, with Ab and a third unidentified man being wanted as accomplices. In a December 3, 2008, interview with PhillyHeatTV, AR-Ab revealed he was found \\"not guilty\\", having spent two years fighting the case. Cassidy had surrendered to Philadelphia police on the afternoon of June 17, 2005. The case took a turn when the primary witness withdrew his confession. On January 25, 2006, Cassidy was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime for his involvement in the shooting. He was sentenced to 11 to 23 months in prison plus probation, and was credited with the 7 months he had already served. He was released after serving 8 months in prison, and went on to relaunch the Larsiny Family which included then-member AR-Ab. = 2013 prison sentence = On April 13, 2013, media outlets reported on a tweet from rapper AR-Ab referring to a past crime which caught up to him. \\"3 years ago I got caught up in a big drug trafficking raid, it just caught up to me. Now I gottta pay da price. I'm doing my final show tonite\\", claimed the tweet. Speculations were abound whether he would be going to jail soon. On April 26, videographer Gil Videos uploaded a video with Ab revealing he will be turning himself in to the authorities. Following his prison sentence, music videos from AR-Ab and OBH members prominently featured the \\"Free AR-Ab\\" slogan, and urged fans to write to Abdul West while he's in prison. He was released on parole in November 2014, having served 18 months. According to interviews, Ab was booked for charges related to crack cocaine and faced up to 3 years, which was hastened to 18 months through his participation in the boot camp program. = 2011 shootings = During an incident late-September 2011, West survived being shot ten times. A tweet dated September 24, 2011, showed a bandaged West lying in bed recuperating with the caption \\"10 shots couldn't stop me!!!\\" A previous Tweet confirmed he was in the hospital receiving treatment. He is reported to have suffered two shots to the stomach, two to the hand, five to the glutes and one shot to the thigh. = Feud with Meek Mill = Drake referenced West on his song \\"Back to Back\\" where he says \\"I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-Ab\\". West later appeared on VladTV in August 2015 saying that while he hasn't signed on to Drake's OVO Sound and sided with him saying he was disappointed in Mill's response. Mill responded on August 6 during a performance in Camden, New Jersey where he said \\"Fuck AR-Ab\\" and questioned his allegiance to an out-of- town rapper. West responded by releasing his own version of \\"Back to Back\\" freestyle on August 8 which dissed Mill and also contained violent lyrics where he threatened to unleash his \\"shooters\\" upon Mill. In response, Meek's cousin Omelly released his own version of \\"Back to Back\\" freestyle which dissed AR-Ab and also contained violent lyrics. AR-Ab did another interview on VladTV where he said Mill was too scared to respond himself and Omelly was the \\"softest one on Dream Chasers\\". He also told that he won't respond to Omelly's diss because he's a \\"worker\\". In January 2016, West revealed that he and Mill had reconciled. = 2018 indictment = In October 2018, West, alongside eight others said to be members of a drug trafficking organization, were indicted on counts of distributing drugs in North Philadelphia.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/superseding-indictment- filed-charging-nine-members-north-philadelphia-drug-trafficking His charges include a conspiracy to distribute, the possession, and the distribution of cocaine, crack, methamphetamine, and heroin. The indictment identified West as the leader of the gang, and that the gang obtained high-end properties in Philadelphia to protect their supply. On November 19, 2019, West was found guilty of several counts of conspiracy and distribution of crack cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine in the federal conspiracy case. West has not yet been sentenced.

Cobalt oxide nanoparticles have potential applications in lithium-ion batteries and electronic gas sensors. Applications Lithium-ion Battery The anodes of lithium-ion batteries are often made of oxides of cobalt, nickel, or iron, that can readily and reversibly incorporate lithium ions in their molecular structure. Cobalt oxide nanoparticles, such as nanotubes, offer high surface-to-volume ratio and short path length for lithium cation transport, leading to high reversible capacity and good cycle life. The particles may incorporate other substances, asfor example diphenylalanine/cobalt oxide hybrid nanowires. Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles anchored on a single sheet of graphene. Cobalt oxide particles may be anchored on substrates such as graphene to improve the dimensional stability of the anode and to prevent particle aggregation during lithium charge and discharge processes. Gas Sensor Hollow nanospheres of cobalt oxide have been investigated as materials for gas sensor electrodes, for the detection of toluene, acetone, and other organic vapors. Cobalt oxide nanoparticles anchored on single-walled carbon nanotubes have been investigated for sensing nitrogen oxides and hydrogen. This application takes advantage of the reactivity between the gas and the oxide, as well as the electrical connection with the substrate (both being p-type semiconductors). Nitrogen oxides react with the oxide as electron acceptors, reducing the electrode's resistance; whereas hydrogen acts as an electron donor, increasing the resistance. Medicine Cobalt oxide nanoparticles have been observed to readily enter cells, a property that conceivably could lead to applications in hyperthermic treatment, gene therapy and drug delivery. However, their toxicity is an obstacle that would have to be overcome. Synthesis Hydrothermal Cobalt oxide is often obtained by hydrothermal synthesis in an autoclave. One-pot hydrothermal synthesis of metal oxide hollow spheres starts with carbohydrates and metal salts dissolved in water at 100-200 ¬∞C. The reaction produces carbon spheres, with metal ions integrated into the hydrophobic shell. The carbon cores are removed by calcination, leaving hollow metal oxide spheres. Surface area and thickness of the shell can be manipulated by varying the carbohydrate to metal salt concentration, as well as the temperature, pressure, and pH of the reaction medium, and the cations of the starting salts. The completion time for the procedure varies from hours to days. Hydrothermal Synthesis of Cobalt Oxide Hollow Sphere. A drawback of this approach is a smaller yield compared to other methods. Thermal decomposition TEM image (right) of cobalt oxide nanoparticles produced by thermal decomposition of organometallic precursor Co-salen (left). Another route to the synthesis of cobalt oxide nanoparticles is the thremaldecomposition of organometallic compounds. For example, heating the metal salen complex bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediiminecobalt(II) (\\"Co-salen\\") in air to 500 ¬∞C. The precursor Co-salen can be obtained by reacting cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate in propanol at 50 ¬∞C under nitrogen atmosphere with the salen ligand (bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediimine). From anchored precursors Cobalt oxide/graphene composite are synthesized by first forming cobalt(II) hydroxide on the graphene sheet from a cobalt(II) salt and ammonium hydroxide , which is then heated to 450 ¬∞C for two hours to yield the oxide. Safety Like most reactive cobalt compounds, cobalt oxide nanoparticles are toxic to humans and also aquatic life.

The unique honeycomb 2-D structure of graphene contributes to its unique optical properties. The honeycomb structure allows electrons to exist as massless quasiparticles known as Dirac fermions. Graphene's optical conductivity properties are thus unobstructed by any material parameters represented by equation 1, where e is the electron charge, is Planck's constant and represents the universal conductance. ;Equation 1: \\\\sigma_{\\\\text{uni}} = \\\\frac{(\\\\pi)e^2}{2h} Figure 1a A representation of graphene's band gap before and after doping Figure 1b A representation of convention metal and semiconductor band gaps. This simple behavior is the result of an undoped graphene material at zero temperature (figure 1a). In contrast to traditional semiconductors or metals (figure 1b); graphene's band gap are near nonexistent as the conducting and valence bands make contact (figure 1a). However, the band gap is tunable via doping and electrical gating, resulting in changes in graphene's optical properties. As a result of its tunable conductivity, graphene is employed in various optical applications. Graphene lenses as ultra-broad photodetectors Electrical gating and doping allows for adjustment of graphene's optical absorptivity. The application of electric fields transverse to staggered graphene bilayers generates a shift in Fermi energy and an artificial, non-zero band gap (equation 2 figure 1). Optical tunability of graphene under strong electric gating ;Equation 2: Œ¥D=Dt - Db where Dt = top electrical displacement field Db = bottom electrical displacement field Varying Œ¥D above or below zero(Œ¥D=0 denotes non-gated, neutral bilayers) allows electrons to pass through the bilayer without altering the gating-induced band gap. As shown in Figure 2, varying the average displacement field, ‚ñÅD, alters the bilayer's absorption spectra. The optical tunability resulting from gating and electrostatic doping (also known as charge plasma doping) lends to the application of graphene as ultra-broadband photodetectors in lenses. Figure 3 Schematic of double-layer graphene ultra-broadband photodetector Chang-Hua et al. implemented graphene in an infrared photodetector by sandwiching an insulating barrier of Ta2O5 between two graphene sheets. The graphene layers became electrically isolated and exhibited an average Fermi difference of 0.12eV when a current was passed through the bottom layer (figure 3). When the photodetector is exposed to light, excited hot electrons transitioned from the top graphene layer to the bottom, a process promoted by the structural asymmetry of the insulating Ta2O5 barrier. A consequence of the hot electron transition, the top layer accumulates positive charges and induces a photogating effect on the lower graphene layer, which is measured as a change in current correlating with photon detection. Utilizing graphene both as a channel for charge transport and light absorption, the graphene ultra-broadband photodetectors ably detects the visible to mid-infrared spectrum. Nanometers thin and functional at room temperature, graphene ultra-broadband photodetectors show promise in lens application. Graphene lenses as Fresnel zone plates File:Figure 4 the graphene Fresnel Zone Plate reflects the light off to a single point.png Figure 4 the graphene Fresnel Zone Plate reflects the light off to a single point. Fresnel zone plates are devices that focus light on a fixed point in space. These devices concentrate light reflected off a lens onto a singular point8 (figure 4). Composed of a series of discs centered about an origin, Fresnel zone plates are manufactured using laser pulses, which embed voids into reflective lens. Despite its weak reflectance (R = 0.25œÄ2 Œ± 2 at T = 1.3 √ó 10-4 K), graphene has utility as a lens for Fresnel zone plates. It has been shown that graphene lenses effectively concentrate light of  é = 850 nm onto a single point 120 um away from the Fresnel zone plate8 (figure 5). Further investigation illustrates that the reflected intensity increases linearly with the number of graphene layers within the lens (figure 6). That the reflected intensity increases linearly with the number of graphene layers within the len Graphene lenses as transparent conductors Optoelectronic components such as light-emitting diode (LED) displays, solar cells, and touch screens require highly transparent materials with low sheet resistance, Rs. For a thin film, the sheet resistance is given by equation 3: ;Equation 3 R_{\\\\text{s}} = \\\\frac{t}{\\\\sigma} with t = film thickness \\\\sigma = {d.c. conductivity} A material with tunable thickness, t, and conductivity, œÉ, possesses useful optoelectronic applications if Rs is reasonably small. Graphene is such a material; the amount of graphene layers that comprise the film can tune t and the inherent tunability of graphene's optical properties via doping or grating can tune sigma. Figure 7 shows graphene's potential relative to other known transparent conductors. Graphene's potential relative to other known transparent conductors The need for alternative transparent conductors is well documented. Current semiconductor based transparent conductors such as doped indium oxides, zinc oxides, or tin oxides suffer from practical downfalls including rigorous processing requirements, prohibitive cost, sensitivity toward acidic or basic media, and a brittle consistency. However, graphene does not suffer from these downfalls.

Family and early years The Sanavongsay family came to the United States in the aftermath of the Laotian Civil War. Nor Sanavongsay initially resettled with his parents, one brother, and one sister in the town of Kingsport, Tennessee in 1979. He was four years old at the time. They were sponsored by the First Presbyterian Church of Kingsport, Tennessee. In August 1979 they relocated to Elgin, Illinois, where he would spend the next 30 years. He grew up watching Transformers, Bruce Lee movies, Thundercats, and other cartoons of the 1980s. He also had a fascination with comic books and graphic novels. He began drawing at the age of six with his uncle as a mentor. He honed his artistic skills as the years passed by, and he initially went to Northern Illinois University to study to be an illustrator. He eventually changed his major to web design, graduating in 1998. In 2010 he moved to San Francisco and is currently living in Dublin, California with his wife and two children. Community service and professional career He has actively been involved as a volunteer with the SatJaDham Lao Literary Project, the National Lao American Writers Summit, the Lao Artists Festival of Elgin, Legacies of War, the Center for Lao Studies, the Lao Heritage Foundation, Laos in the House, and the Kinnaly Dance Troupe, among many others. In 2013, he founded Sahtu Press, Inc., a nonprofit publishing company with the mission to promote Lao literature to the world. Professionally, he has worked for companies including Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Sears, Zoosk, Barnes & Noble and currently Workday, Inc.. Art and writing He is the author of the 2013 children's book A Sticky Mess inspired by classic Lao folktales, particularly that of the folk hero Xieng Mieng. In interviews he noted that it took nearly 14 years to finally get the book to publication and that it had gone through many iterations. He has announced intentions for a five-book series over the next ten years. The first run of the book's publication was funded through Kickstarter. Nor Sanavongsay is also at work developing the children's book series Kiwi the Green Koala with Dr. Poe Phetthongsy. Recently, he has been sharing examples of his work depicting the classical Lao legends of the Kinnaly.

The website was co-founded in January 2015 by Laura Weffer, former director of Venezuelan newspaper Diario 2001, Luz Mely Reyes, and Josefina Ruggiero, former content director of Cadena Capriles‚Äî award-winning journalists. History Among recent issues of censorship in Venezuela, alternate media began to emerge in the country. Following the resignation of Laura Weffer due to issues with her newspaper's coverage of the 2014‚Äì15 Venezuelan protests, and an arraignment of Luz Mely Reyes by the Venezuelan government following a report about gasoline shortages in Venezuela, the two began to plan a new project. Their plan included the involvement of aspiring journalists and helping them grow their talents through the pair's \\"veteran experience\\". Mely Reyes said that the project grew out of \\"the need for many to receive accurate, timely and transparent information\\". Univision stated that with the loss of independent media in Venezuela, the creation of Efecto Cocuyo began to \\"illuminate\\" the country again. On 8 January 2015, Efecto Cocuyo sent out its first tweet and received 12,000 followers on Twitter two days later. On 15 January, they announced the construction of their website after they found a local website developer and a location for a small office. As of March 2015, Efecto Cocuyo had about 40,000 Twitter followers. On 12 September 2019, the outlet won the Human Rights award from the Washington Office on Latin America for their continued coverage of the Crisis in Venezuela. Funding The website receives funding through public donations, having seen its founders go to the streets in Venezuela asking for support. Some funds have also been acquired through crowdfunding. Funding received goes to new-hire reporters and towards \\"breaking-news analysis, investigative reports and comprehensive content about crucial information\\". In popular culture In cartoons depicting censorship in Venezuela and the Venezuelan government's purchase of media organizations, the owners of Efecto Cocuyo have been depicted as combating such actions; these cartoons were printed in Mexican newspapers Reforma, Mural, El Norte and about 50 other publications in the country.

He wrote them on Latin texts for penitence, scored for four unaccompanied voices.  Structure and texts  The four motets are: # Timor et tremor # Vinea mea electa # Tenebrae factae sunt # Tristis est anima mea The text for the first motet, Timor et tremor (Great fear and trembling), combines verses from psalms 54 and 30, which Orlando de Lassus had also set as a motet. The other three motets are based on three responsories for the Holy Week: \\"Vinea mea electa\\" (Vine that I loved as my own), a responsory for the matins of Good Friday, \\"Tenebrae factae sunt\\" (Darkness fell upon the Earth), a responsory for the matins of Holy Saturday, and \\"Tristis est anima mea\\" (Sad is my soul and sorrowful), a responsory for the matins of Maundy Thursday.  History  Poulenc returned to sacred music first in 1937 when he composed the missa brevis Messe en sol majeur (Mass in G). He then wrote the four motets, at different times. He wrote \\"Timor et tremor\\" last, in Noizay in January 1939, and dedicated it to Monsieur l'Abb√© Maillet. He composed \\"Vinea mea electa\\" there in December 1938 and dedicated it to Yvonne Gouvern√©. \\"Tenebrae factae sunt\\" was the first of the four motets, written there in July, dedicated to Nadia Boulanger. Poulenc composed \\"Tristis est anima mea\\" in Paris in November 1938 and dedicated it to Ernest Bourmauck. The motets are written for a mixed choir a cappella, at times further divided. The first performance was sung in February 1939, probably in Paris, by Les Petits Chanteurs √† la Croix de Bois, repeated in several churches in Paris during the Holy Week, according to a review by Claude Chamfray.  Selected recordings  Recordings were made by the chamber choir Polyphony, conducted by Stephen Layton, by the Westminster Cathedral Choir, conducted by James O'Donnell, and by The Cambridge Singers, conducted by John Rutter, among others. The Norwegian chamber choir Grex Vocalis, conducted by Carl H√∏gset, recorded the motets along with the Messe en sol majeur.

The hills are named after Rovte, which is the largest settlement in the area. Most of the area is part of the Ljubljanica and Sora watersheds, and a smaller portion is part of the Idrijca watershed. Many creeks rise in the central part of the hills, composed of impermeable rock. These include Sovra Creek, Rovtarica Creek, Hotenjka Creek, and White Creek (), and they have carved ravines into the hills. Rounded hills rise above them, with typical names such as Marinc Hill (), Bear Hill (), and Grass Peak (), as well as small karstified plateaus. Permeable rock predominates on the margins of the hills, where larger watercourses have carved deep valleys. The highest point in the Rovte Hills is Three Kings Peak (, ). The elevation of the valley bottoms drops to around . History The Rovte Hills were not settled until the late Middle Ages. Isolated farms were created in clearings, followed by hamlets and dispersed villages. The oldest settlements in the hills include Vrh Svetih Treh Kraljev, Hlevi≈°e, Zaplana, and Medvedje Brdo.
