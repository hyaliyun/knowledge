Description  The Ranunculaceae were included directly in the Thalamiflorae by de Candolle (1819-1824) as an order within that subclass. They were paraphyletic and considered a very primitive group with a key position in angiosperm phylogeny. In the Bentham and Hooker classification they were characterised as having \\"stamens usually many, carpels free, endosperm conspicuous, embryo small\\". The term may be qualified by using its broader circumscription (sensu lato), i.e Ranales s.l.. In the Bentham and Hooker system (1862-1883), the Ranales were the first cohort of the Thalamiflorae with eight families: *::: I. RANUNCULACE√Ü *::: II. DILLENIACE√Ü *::: III. CALYCANTHACE√Ü *::: IV. MAGNOLIACE√Ü *::: V. ANONACE√Ü [sic] *::: VI. MENISPERMACE√Ü *::: VII. BERBERIDE√Ü *::: VIII. NYMPH√ÜACE√Ü Bessey (1915) made it a much larger entity within the Strobiloideae with twenty four families. Later, Hutchinson (1959) circumscribed the Ranales more narrowly with only four families (Ranunculaceae, Cabombaceae, Ceratophyllaceae, Nymphaeaceae) within the Archychlamydeae. Melchior (1964) preferred the term Ranunculales to include the Ranunculaceae within Archychlamydeae, the term which is still in use including seven families but little overlap with Hutchinson. Cronquist (1968-1981), one of the more influential twentieth century classifications had eight families and placed the Ranunculales in the larger Magnoliidae. Ranunculales has been used by most subsequent systems with the exception of Thorne (1992), with Berberidales, but with widely varying numbers of families. The current APG system uses Ranunculales in the Eudicot clade with seven families.

The 'Big House' and demesne were dominant features in the rural landscape of Ireland, throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Location often reflected the distribution of better land, and this is evidenced in mid-Cork, where many of these houses are situated along the valley of the River Lee and its tributaries. The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage describes it as built c. 1810, being a five-bay, two-storey over basement house, and having symmetrical chimneystacks, elegant proportions, tall windows, a centralised arched doorcase and limestone perron (staircase). A gate lodge is indicated on the 1841 surveyed OS map at the roadside entrance to Aghavrin House, but no longer appears to exist. A summer house is indicated on the 1901 surveyed OS map, as a garden feature within the grounds, and still exists as a ruined semi- circular unroofed ivy-clad stone structure. It was once the residence of the Crooke family. Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837) describes the demesne of Ahavrin as small but well planted, and refers to 'Capt. T. E. Crooke' of 'Ahavrin House'. The tithe applotment book for the parish of Aghabullogue records 'Thomas Crook Esq.' of 'Ahavren' as occupying c.130 acres. The mid-nineteenth century Primary Valuation of Ireland (Griffith's Valuation) records William Crooke as occupying c. 83 acres in Aghavrin townland, which consisted of a 'house, offices, gate lodge and land', with the lessor being John B. Gumbleton. There is also reference to a William Crooke occupying c.20 acres of land, with the lessor being John Bowen. The Ordnance Survey name book (c. 1840) describes Aghavrin townland as the property of John Bowin, Esq. of Oak Grove, and John Bowin Gumbleton, Esq. Its condition was said to be of mixed quality, principally cultivated, but containing some boggy land, rocks and furze. To the south of Aghavrin House is Crooke's Castle, constructed by Thomas Epinetus Crooke, who served during the Napoleonic Wars, mainly on board HMS Shamrock, a Royal Navy blockade ship. The Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 confirms Aghavrin House as the residence of Mrs Scott (maiden name Crooke) and that her family had built the property. It also notes that, during the War of Independence (Ireland), IRA members had billeted themselves on the premises without invitation from the owner. During the twentieth century, the property became the residence of Brigadier Michael John Cahill OBE, who died in 1968 and is interred at Christchurch graveyard, Coachford. Today, it remains a private residence, and is not accessible to the public.

Description Dun Beag () is situated at the north end of a small rocky knoll. The broch consists of a drystone tower with a diameter of around 18.6 metres with walls about 4 metres thick at the base. The broch currently stands to a maximum height of 2 metres. The interior has a diameter of about 11 metres, and the entrance is on the east side. Internally three openings are visible in the broch wall. One leads to a small chamber; a second leads to a long narrow gallery within the wall; and a third leads to the stone stair of which some twenty steps survive. History The broch was visited by Thomas Pennant in 1772, and it was still a substantial structure, with a height of perhaps 4 metres. The following year a broch near Ullinish, which was probably Dun Beag, was visited by Samuel Johnson and James Boswell during their Tour to the Hebrides. Around half of its wall height has been lost since the 18th century. The broch was excavated by the Countess Vincent Baillet de Latour between 1914 and 1920. Some 200 tons of earth and stones were removed from the broch and all the soil was sifted through the excavators' fingers. The standard of recording and publication was poor. Finds included many stone implements and utensils, a gold ring, bronze objects, a piece of folded sheet lead, iron and glass objects, a borer of bone, a pick made from an antler, much pottery and a stone cup. Several hundred glass beads were found although they are not thought to be prehistoric. Coins of Henry II, Edward I, James VI, George II and George III have been discovered, and it is possible that the broch was in use until comparatively recently.

Cooper also acted as a session guitarist on American southern rock band Shotgun Rebellion's debut album Train of Pain in addition to performing on a limited number of dates with the band.  History  Cooper moved to Denison, Texas when he was 16 years of age. Having met Pantera shortly thereafter, and opening for them as part of Texas Hippie Coalition, he became attracted to Dean Guitars, and played the same Vintage 82 DEAN from 1989 until at least 2009. In 1991, an automobile accident in Oklahoma City turned the guitarist into a quadriplegic, confining him to a wheelchair and forcing him to regain his stride. After regaining motion in his right arm and both legs, Cooper spent additional time in rehab, recovering only one finger on his left hand. This contributes to the musician's unique style of playing.  Texas Hippie Coalition  In mid-2012, Cooper tore a tendon in his right arm, which required extensive rehabilitation. With a pair of cysts under his arm that encircled the tendons, he could only play guitar for a few minutes at a time, which rendered him unable to tour later that year.  Departure from Texas Hippie Coalition  Following Cooper's departure from Texas Hippie Coalition, the veteran guitarist joined rock band Emperors and Elephants. Additionally, Cooper performed a select number of tour dates with southern rock band Shotgun Rebellion while assisting the ensemble with their debut studio album. Randy Cooper's work also includes a guest appearance on Hell Rider Recording Artist, Scattered Hamlet's debut full length, Skeleton Dixie, where he played lead guitar on \\"Falling Off the Wagon.\\". He's also been known to make unannounced guest appearances with the band to play that song live. In October 2015, it was announced that Emperors and Elephants would begin the new year by starting work on a new album with producer Scott Wilson. Two months later, Cooper and the band announced that they had decided to part ways. In 2016, Cooper performed a show with American rock band Coming Up Zero. In 2018, the guitarist started a new band called Victory Season.  Influences  Cooper's influences include M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Pantera as well as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads, Zakk Wylde and Darrell Abbott.  Equipment  Cooper uses Dean Guitars and EMG-81/85 pickups. In 2012, the musician was quoted as using a Dean ML.

Life Dom Luigj Bum√ßi was born in Shkod√´r, back then in the Scutari Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, on 7 November 1872 in an Albanian Catholic family. He was the nephew of writer and Rilindas Pashko Vasa. Bum√ßi trained for the priesthood in his native town and, in January 1912, was made bishop of Lezh√´. In 1918, he participated in the Congress of Durr√´s and was elected Minister without Portfolio in the government of Turhan Pasha that came out of the congress. In 1919, he was sent by the government to preside over the Albanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. He intermediated through the Pope Benedict XV for opposing the Venizelos‚ÄìTittoni agreement for partitioning of Albania between Italy and Greece. He also participated in the Congress of Lushnje in January 1920 and, as a representative of the Catholic community, was elected to the four-member High Regency Council (). Together with Aqif Pasha Bi√ßaku he took part in a coup d‚Äô√©tat in December 1921 and was later relieved of his duties on the High Council by Ahmet Zogu. Thereafter, with some advice from Vatican, Bum√ßi withdrew from politics and returned to his ecclesiastical duties. He kept close relationship with Gjergj Fishta and Luigj Gurakuqi. He lobbied a lot for enabling Gurakuqi to enter the Assembly of Albania. He was arrested by the communist authorities right after World War II. Tired of age and interrogations he died on 1 March 1945.

Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, D.C. have the largest Ukrainian-American communities in the Mid-Atlantic. Demographics St. Michael's, a Ukrainian Catholic parish in Baltimore, January 2016. Ze Mean Bean Caf√©, Fell's Point, June 2014. National Slavic Museum in Fell's Point, June 2014. Patterson Park, January 2016. Alexander Onischuk, a chess grandmaster. The Ukrainian community in the Baltimore metropolitan area numbered 10,806 as of 2000, making up 0.4% of the area's population. In the same year, Baltimore city's Ukrainian population was 1,567, which is 0.2% of the city's population. In 1920, 151 foreign-born White people in Baltimore spoke the Ukrainian language, then referred to as the Ruthenian language. In 1940, 14,670 immigrants from the Soviet Union lived in Baltimore, many of whom were of Ukrainian descent. These immigrants comprised 24.1% of the city's foreign-born white population. In 2013, an estimated 808 Ukrainian-Americans resided in Baltimore city, 0.1% of the population. As of September 2014, immigrants from Ukraine were the twentieth largest foreign-born population in Baltimore. History=19th century Ukrainians began settling in Baltimore during the 1880s, mostly in East Baltimore and Southeast Baltimore and especially in the Highlandtown neighborhood. Other Ukrainians settled in Washington Hill and Fell's Point, where there was a Ukrainian store. Most of these immigrants came from Western Ukraine and were Catholic. By the 1890s, Ukrainian Catholic priests were traveling from Pennsylvania to Baltimore to serve the Ukrainian Catholic community. St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church was founded as a parish in 1893 and the church was built in 1912. While many immigrants from Western Ukraine identify simply as Ukrainian Americans, others identify as Rusyn American. Rusyns also sometimes describe themselves as Carpatho-Rusyns, Carpatho-Russians or Ruthenians. Some of the Western Ukrainians that established St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church identified as Rusyns. Rusyns also helped establish Sts. Peter & Paul Ukrainian Catholic Church. Many Rusyn and Western Ukrainians have settled in the neighborhoods of Fell's Point and Patterson Park. Western Ukrainians began immigrating to Baltimore during the 1880s. 20th century During the early 1900s, many Ukrainian immigrants to Baltimore worked for steel- and glass-makers. From the 1920s to the 1970s, the Ukrainian American Citizen's Club and Ukrainian National Home was the focal point of the Ukrainian-American community in Baltimore. Coalescing as an informal association in the 1920s, the club was legally incorporated in 1931. The club owned a property at 3101 O'Donnell Street, which became the Ukrainian National Home. The home included a school for the Ukrainian language and culture, the Vasile Avramenko School of Ukrainian Dancing, the Ukrainian American Citizen's Club Choir, and a softball team for Ukrainian-Americans. The space was also used by multiple community organizations and after World War II it was used as accommodations for displaced refugees. By the 1940s, the Ukrainian community in Highlandtown numbered around 1,200. Many Ukrainians fled to Baltimore from the 1930s to the 1950s in order to escape political persecution, labor camps, the Holodomor famine, or deportation to Siberia. Every year Ukrainian refugees and their children and grandchildren celebrate their good fortune on Thanksgiving Day by giving a toast and playing a game of football in Patterson Park. On 29 May 2008, the city of Baltimore held a candlelight commemoration for the Holodomor at the War Memorial Plaza in front of City Hall. This ceremony was part of the larger international journey of the \\"International Holodomor Remembrance Torch\\", which began in Kiev and made its way through thirty-three countries. Twenty-two other US cities were also visited during the tour. Then-Mayor Sheila Dixon presided over the ceremony and declared 29 May to be \\"Ukrainian Genocide Remembrance Day in Baltimore\\". She referred to the Holodomor as \\"among the worst cases of man's inhumanity towards man\\". In 1969, the Ukrainian American Citizen's Club granted usage and maintenance of the Ukrainian National Home to the Dnipro Ukrainian Club. Beginning in the 1970s, large numbers of Ukrainian Jews immigrated to Baltimore in order to escape antisemitism in the then Soviet Union. In the early 1980s, about 70% of the Soviet Jews in Baltimore had immigrated from the then Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. One-third came from Odessa, Baltimore's sister-city at the time. Ze Mean Bean Caf√© in Fell's Point opened in 1995. It is a restaurant which offers Ukrainian cuisine, as well as other Slavic and Eastern European fare. The restaurant was founded by Yvonne Dornic as an ode to Ivan Dornic, her Czechoslovakian-born Carpatho-Rusyn father. 21st century The National Slavic Museum opened in 2012. The museum focuses on the Slavic history of Baltimore, including Baltimore's Ukrainian history. In light of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the Russian intervention in Crimea, Ukrainians in Baltimore have mobilized to support the pro-Ukrainian cause. The Lemko House, an apartment complex on South Ann Street, provides housing for Eastern European immigrants. Founded in 1983 by Ivan Dornic, an Eastern Rite priest, the complex is named after Dornic's ethnic group, the Lemkos. The Lemkos are a Rusyn ethnic group inhabiting Lemkivshchyna, a part of Transcarpathia that spans parts of Slovakia, Poland, and Ukraine. Lemko House has opened its doors to low-income residents of any ethnicity, but is still home to many Slavic and Eastern European immigrants. Little Ukrainian Village A corridor of Baltimore's Patterson Park neighborhood is referred to by locals as \\"The Little Ukrainian Village in Baltimore\\" and \\"Little Ukraine.\\" The village is home to St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church and Baltimore's Ukrainian-American festival, as well as organizations for Ukrainians, such as the SelfReliance Baltimore Federal Credit Union, the Ukrainian-American Youth Association, and the Dnipro Ukrainian Club, a sports club and cultural organization. The Ukrainian Festival was founded in 1976 and is organized by the Baltimore Ukrainian Festival Committee, a non-profit affiliated with the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA). The festival lasts two days and features traditional Ukrainian music, dancing, crafts, and cuisine. Notable Ukrainian-Americans from Baltimore *Joseph H.

After suffering a heart attack in May 1959, Duvalier named Barbot as his proxy; once he recovered he accused Barbot of trying to usurp him as President, and had him imprisoned at the notorious Fort Dimanche.

It originally aired on September 9, 2010. The episode was written by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec and directed by J. Miller Tobin. Plot The episode starts from exactly where the last episode of the first season ends. Elena (Nina Dobrev) walks in the door and she hears a noise in the kitchen that makes her go check what is happening. She finds John (David Anders) lying on the floor and she immediately calls 911. Katherine is standing right behind her and John warns her about it. Elena grabs the knife and tries to see who is in the house but Katherine leaves before the two meet. Elena rushes to Jeremy's (Steven R. McQueen) and finds him unconscious in his bed. The paramedics take John away when Stefan (Paul Wesley) arrives and checks Jeremy to see if he is a vampire. Stefan says that he is still a human and he assumes that Jeremy did not take enough pills to really kill himself and Anna's blood healed him. He warns Jeremy not to try it again since the vampire blood exits his system very quickly and he could easily end up killing himself for real. Bonnie (Kat Graham) gets to the hospital and finds Matt (Zach Roerig) waiting outside Caroline's (Candice Accola) room. Matt tells her about the accident and how Tyler (Michael Trevino) lost control because of sound he said he was hearing. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) also arrives at the hospital and checks on Liz (Marguerite MacIntyre) who asks him to find out why Mayor Lockwood was affected by the vampire device, something that led to his death. Elena gets to the hospital and asks Bonnie if she can do a spell to save her life but Bonnie is not trained enough to do something that difficult. Damon shows up and offers to give Caroline his blood to heal her. Elena has her doubts about it but she finally agrees after Bonnie's urge. Damon tries to bring up the kiss when he stays along with Elena but Elena has no idea what he is talking about. Jenna (Sara Canning) arrives and when Elena cannot remember talking to her either, Damon figures out that Katherine is back in town. Katherine arrives at the Gilbert house to find Stefan who's there to keep an eye on Jeremy. She tries to kiss him but Stefan realizes that is not Elena and pushes her away. The two of them fight a little before Elena and Damon walked in and Katherine disappears. They try to figure out why Katherine is back and what she is up to and Damon also admits that he kissed Katherine thinking she was Elena, something that makes Stefan upset. Elena stops them before they get into a fight. Mason Lockwood (Taylor Kinney) is back in town for his brother's funeral; he has been away for years. Tyler seems surprised to see him and Damon asks Liz if he is also in the council. Liz tells him that Mason is not a believer of the supernatural. Stefan and Elena go to the hospital to talk to John and find out more about Katherine. Elena gives John his ring back and asks him about Katherine but John says that he has never talked directly to her, only via Isobel, so he doesn't know anything. He also points out that he hates the fact seeing Elena with a vampire and Elena just leaves the room telling him that his hatred will kill him. Stefan stays behind and threatens John to kill him and turn him into the thing he hates the most, a vampire (he forces him to drink his blood), if he will not leave town and get out of Elena's life within 24 hours. Katherine arrives at the Mayor's wake and Bonnie walks right over to her. Thinking she is Elena, she tells her about Damon giving his blood to Caroline to heal her but when she touches her she realizes that she is not Elena. She walks away to call Elena but Katherine follows her and introduces herself. Bonnie try to cause her a headache using her powers but Katherine has been around for a long time and Bonnie's spell is too weak yet to work on her. Katherine attacks her and Stefan gets there asking Katherine to let her go and she does. Stefan and Katherine talk and Stefan wants to know why she is back. The two of them get out of the house and walk away to talk alone just the moment Elena arrives with Jeremy and Jenna. Elena has a talk with Damon about \\"their\\" kiss and she says that he is hurt because he thought he kissed her but Damon does not admit it. Jeremy finds Tyler drinking and pays his respects for his father's death. The two of them share some memories of dead parents before Mason walks in and chases Jeremy out. Later, in a moment of grief, Tyler smashes his father's office and when his mother tries to stop him he attacks her. Mason gets there in time to hold him back. Stefan and Katherine are now away from the house and Stefan still tries to get out of Katherine the reason she is back. She says she is back because of him but Stefan tells her that he was never in love with her since she was compelling him. When he tells her he hates her, she stabs him in the stomach and runs off. Elena finds Stefan and helps him with his wound while asking for Katherine. Damon also arrives and tries to provoke Stefan over his kiss with \\"Elena\\" but Stefan, even though he is angry at Damon, he tells him that they have to be united now that Katherine is here and they should not let her drive them apart because that's exactly what she is trying to do. John is ready to leave and he says goodbye to Jeremy while he tries to explain him that he grew up learning to hate vampires, just like his father did. Jeremy wonders why the ring did not protect his father's life and John explains him that the ring cannot protect you from accidents but only if death comes from a supernatural cause. Damon gets back home and finds Katherine waiting on the couch. She says she is here to say goodbye but Damon knows she is not leaving before she gets what she wants, something they still try to figure out. Katherine tries to seduce him and they end up kissing. Damon stops just to ask her if she ever loved him and he can forget everything so they can start over but Katherine tells him that she never loved him and it was always Stefan. She leaves, leaving Damon heartbroken. Damon goes to Elena drunk and sad and he tries to prove to her that she feels something for him but she is in denial. He kisses her against her will and Elena pushes him back telling him that she cares about him but she loves Stefan and it will always be Stefan. Jeremy walks in to defend his sister but Damon, even more hurt, turns to Jeremy. He remembers that Jeremy wanted to be a vampire and knowing that he has Anna's blood in his system, he snaps his neck and leaves, leaving Elena behind crying over Jeremy's body. Elena sees that Jeremy is wearing his father's ring and she knows that he will come back but she doesn't know if he will come back as a vampire or not. Stefan comes after Damon leaves and he tries to tell her that Damon must have seen the ring that's why he killed Jeremy but Elena is sure that he did not. She now hates him and believes that there is nothing good left in him. Jeremy wakes up and when Stefan checks on him, he says that he is still a human. The episode ends at the hospital, where Katherine pays a visit to Caroline. Caroline believes that she is Elena but Katherine introduces herself and wants to give a message to Stefan and Damon via Caroline---Game On. Katherine, knowing that Caroline has Damon's blood in her system, smothers Caroline to death with a pillow and leaves.

Reviews \\"The Return\\" received positive reviews. Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.2/5. \\"On \\"The Return,\\" viewers were welcomed back to Mystic Falls with a slow three-quarters of an episode, as the show caught us up on events from the finale, moved pieces and characters around and laid the groundwork for what was to come.\\" Richenthal, praised Somerhalder's acting once again: \\"We praised Ian Somerhalder's work every week on season one, but it must be highlighted again. [...] ...and, man, did Somerhalder sell his character's pain well.\\" Josie Kafka of Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3.5/4 saying that it looks like it will be a great season. \\"The Season Two premiere was top-notch, and set up plenty of meaty, angsty, delicious goodness for the rest of the season.\\" Diana Steenbergen of IGN rated the episode with 9/10. \\"This episode was packed from start to finish, complete with more than one shocking twist at the end. If this episode is an indication, we can put aside any fears that the second season of the show will be less fun than the first.\\" Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 4/4. \\"When a series has a phenomenal season finale, it leaves the audience eagerly anticipating the next season‚Äôs premiere. The expectations of the viewers are very high. Nearly always, then, the season premiere ends up being a disappointment. [...] The Vampire Diaries‚Äò accomplishment, then, in creating a season opener that does not merely measure up to the previous season finale but surpasses it, is a prodigious one.\\" Franson Pruter closes her review with: \\"The Return succeeds because it does more than just resolve the conflicts left over from the season finale; it heightens and builds on those conflicts to begin the narrative of the new season. I would count this episode as one of the best of the series) and certainly among the best season premieres of all time.\\" Popsugar of Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode stating: \\"Even if it wasn't quite as crazy as I had hoped, it's setting the groundwork for what'll surely be a thrilling arc\\" while Alyse Wax of Fearnet said that the last 10 minutes saved the episode from being a total loss: \\"The action picked up, those ends began to unravel, and intrigue returned to Mystic Falls. I am officially ready for the season to unspool.\\" Lucia from Heroine TV also gave a good review to the episode saying: \\"Overall, I loved ‚ÄúThe Return,‚Äù and it has raised the stakes for the show. All worries about a decline in season two should be assuaged with this episode, as the episode had me reeling. I had high hopes for Katherine, and was not one bit disappointed. Nina Dobrev‚Äôs performance was truly impressive. This premiere sets so many things in motion, and it is clear that there will not be a dull moment this year.\\" Tiffany Vogt of The TV Watchtower gave a good review to the episode saying \\"It is nearly impossible to spot any flaws in this episode. It was a jaw-dropping adrenaline rush from the second it started and one did not dare exhale until after it was done ‚Äî and even then, one still felt a bit breathless. [...] This episode tested boundaries ‚Äî the boundaries of love, of friendship, of abilities. While Damon, Stefan, Elena and Katherine were amidst their self-discoveries, Bonnie too was discovering what her limits were. She discovered she would do anything to save Caroline, including let Damon feed her his blood, and she learned that while she can hurt some vampires, she is not strong enough to tangle with Katherine ‚Äî yet.\\" Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode saying that the episode didn't disappoint and that the show knows how to begin with a bang. \\"Personally, I was pretty impressed with the amount they managed to squeeze in here. I thought that the writing was exceptional, and there were quite a few memorable scenes for us as well. The heart to heart between Damon and Stefan was my favourite. [...] For the most part I was pleased with the premiere of the second season.\\" References Category:2010 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 2) episodes ","title":"The Return (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"41936388","text":"The Calgary Safety Roundup was a popular Canadian television variety series broadcast by CFCN-TV on the Canadian prairies from 1961 until the mid- seventies.

It was described by Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1878. It lives in Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Tanzania and Togo. The larvae have been recorded feeding on Triplochiton scleroxylon, Cola verticillata and Cola ballayi. Eating A. venata larvae (entomophagy) has led to thiamine deficiency (vitamin B1) in people who have used it as a protein source. This is because A. venata larvae have high amounts of thiaminases which break down B1. This type of B1 deficiency has been called \\"African seasonal ataxia\\" (ASA), as A. venata larvae are available as food source for about four months within certain parts of Africa. Connection between entomophagy and B1 deficiency was first discovered in 1992 in Western Nigeria by Bola Adamolekun. Outbreaks, which have later on been thought to be due to B1 deficiency, have been described as early as 1958 along with other cases from e.g. 1972.

With a degree in Graphic Design from Lisbon's IADE ‚Äì Institute of Visual Arts, Design and Marketing, he spent a few years working in design studios in Portugal, followed by an eight-month stint in Munich, Germany. Since 2007, he has been focusing exclusively on his artistic work. Starting out under the full name Add Fuel to the Fire, he first created a dark yet exuberant visual universe populated by a cast of slimy, eccentric and joyful creatures, influenced by a variety of interests ranging from video games to comics, animation, sci-fi, low-budget B films, designer toys, and urban visual culture. In 2008, fascinated with the aesthetic possibilities of symmetrical patterning and tessellations, he shortened his moniker and began redirecting his focus towards working with and reinterpreting the language of traditional tile design, and that of the Portuguese tin-glazed ceramic azulejo in particular. Effortlessly blending these two seemingly-irreconcilable visual idioms, his current practice seeks to combine traditional decorative elements with contemporary visual referents into new forms that reveal an impressive complexity and a masterful attention to detail. If, on the face of it, his work in small- and medium-sized tile panels, large-scale stencil-painted murals, and print editions might seem simply a pastiche of classic formalism, a closer inspection rewards the viewer with a chaotic world of unequivocally original motifs and characters brimming with irony and humour. Creating balance and harmony from symmetrical repetitions, a build-up of layers and techniques of visual illusion such as trompe-l'≈ìil, his multi-layered patterned compositions produce a poetic rhythm that plays with the viewer's perception and the (multiple) possibilities of interpretation. Exploring a wide range of both manual and digital techniques in the fields of drawing, painting, ceramics, and printing, his practice expresses a sophisticated dialogue between the old and the new, between heritage and modernity. Besides the numerous public art interventions he has been creating in various countries, he has also been showcasing his work in solo and group exhibitions in reputed galleries, including Underdogs Gallery (Lisbon, 2017 and 2014), Saatchi Gallery (London, 2017), Nuart Gallery (Stavanger, 2017), ABV Gallery (Atlanta, 2017), Colab Gallery (Weil am Rhein, 2015), Galerie SOON (Zurich, 2013), and Pure Evil Gallery (London, 2012), and leading urban art events such as Nuart Festival (Aberdeen, 2017; Stavanger, 2016), PUBLIC‚Äô16 (Perth and Albany, 2016), Sacramento Mural Fest (Sacramento, 2016), Forgotten Project (Rome, 2015), Djerbahood (Djerba, 2014), and Tour Paris 13 (Paris, 2013), among many others. Diogo Machado lives and works in Cascais, Portugal.  Artistic style  Diogo Machado's artwork combines fictional characters, decorative elements, and humor. His mural work using tiles and stencils is inspired by trompe l'oeil, and often emphasizes symmetry.  Career = Illustration  Add Fuel has cited an older cousin who introduced him to a wide range of popular and classical artforms as a childhood influence.  Street Art, Ceramic panels and Murals  Add Fuel has used azulejo mosaic tiles as a medium for graffiti and other works, and has also described is as a cultural influence. Machado traces his initial interest in reviving azulejo to the Cascais ArtSpace festival in Cascais in 2008. \\"At the time, I received the invitation to cover an entire building with a giant printed canvas and my idea was to develop an illustration piece that would represent me as an inhabitant of my city, being the festival in Cascais.\\" he says. \\"I investigated several portuguese traditional techniques and elements, such as the Galo de Barcelos and the Arraiolos tapestries, but it was a building, so the azulejo aesthetic was the one it felt right to work on\\" After this first experience, Machado studied azulejo and ceramics and began applying it to other urban art settings, often in incongruous and non-traditional contexts. Noteworthy pieces include a 30 meters long ceramic mural, made for the Walk & Talk Public Art Festival on Ponta Delgada in the Azores islands. Add Fuel has also used stencil techniques, partly as a response to the cost and logistical challenges of tile murals. Explaining why he chose the name Add Fuel, Machado has said \\"it's an abbreviation of the expression 'add fuel to the fire' which I like and used as my name for some time. The fact that it's in English is just because it's easier to work in an international market. Diogo Machado is hard to pronounce and to work just in the Portuguese market, unfortunately is not possible.\\"  Exhibitions  *2014.

(October 26, 1888 ‚Äì November 25, 1950) was an American-born Catholic missionary and bishop. As a member of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America (Maryknoll) he was assigned to missions in Korea and Japan. He served as the Prefect Apostolic of Pyongyang from 1927 to 1929, Prefect Apostolic of Kyoto from 1937 to 1940, Apostolic Visitor to Korea from 1947 to 1949, and the Apostolic Delegate to Korea from 1949 to 1950. He died in the custody of the Communists in Korea. Early life Born in Washington, D.C., Patrick Byrne was educated by the Sulpicians at St. Charles College in Ellicott City, Maryland, and St. Mary‚Äôs Seminary in Baltimore. He was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Baltimore on June 23, 1915. Priest A week after he was ordained, Byrne was given permission by Cardinal James Gibbons to enter Maryknoll. He served the community in a variety of capacities. He supervised construction projects at Maryknoll and at Scranton, Pennsylvania, and then served as the rector of both seminaries. He was the editor of Field Afar, and he served as the community's Vicar General and treasurer. In 1923 Byrne organized the first Maryknoll Mission to Korea. On November 9, 1927, Pope Pius XI named him the Prefect Apostolic of Pyongyang. In 1929 he was a delegate to the first General Chapter of Maryknoll and he was elected the Assistant Superior General. He resigned his position as Prefect Apostolic on August 12, 1929, to take up his new responsibilities. In 1935 Byrne reentered the mission field, this time in Kyoto, Japan. Pope Pius XI named him the Prefect Apostolic of Kyoto on June 18, 1937. He resigned this office on October 10, 1940, in favor of a Japanese priest. Because of his charitable reputation he was not imprisoned during the Second World War, but held under house arrest. He made radio broadcasts on behalf of the United States Army to calm the Japanese people as the Americans occupied Japan at the conclusion of the war. Bishop Pope Pius XII appointed Byrne Apostolic Visitor of the Holy See to Korea on July 17, 1947. On April 7, 1949, Pope Pius named him the Titular Bishop of Gazera and the first Apostolic Delegate to Korea. Byrne was consecrated a bishop on June 14, 1949, by Auxiliary Bishop of New York Thomas McDonnell.

He was in Seoul when North Korea forces invaded South Korea in June 1950 and occupied the city. He was arrested by the Communists on July 2, 1950, and put on trial. He was placed on a march that went through the former Maryknoll Mission territory to the Yalu River. Byrne was put of trial again in Pyongyong and was forced on another march that lasted four months. The weather was bad and there was little food or shelter. Byrne came down with pneumonia and died on November 25, 1950, at the age of 62. He was buried by fellow prisoner, Monsignor Thomas F. Quinlan, S.S.C, who was the Prefect Apostolic of Chuncheon. NotesReferences ;Additional sources  Category:1888 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Religious leaders from Washington, D.C.

He was the son and successor of Marzuban ibn Muhammad. Biography Marzuban ibn Muhammad had designated his brother Wahsudan ibn Muhammad as his successor. When he came to Azerbaijan, however, the commanders of the fortresses refused to surrender to him, recognizing instead Marzuban's son Justan I ibn Marzuban I as his successor. Unable to establish his rule in the province, Wahusdan returned to Tarum; Justan was recognized as ruler in Azerbaijan, with his brother Ibrahim made governor of Dvin. Justan seems to have been interested primarily in his harem, a fact which alienated some of his supporters, although he and Ibrahim successfully put down a revolt by a grandson of the caliph al-Muktafi in 960. Shortly afterwards Justan and another brother, Nasir, came to Tarum, where they were treacherously imprisoned by Wahsudan, who sent his son Ismail ibn Wahsudan to take over Azerbaijan. Ibrahim raised an army in Armenia to oppose Isma'il, prompting Wahsudan to execute Justan, his mother and Nasir. Ibrahim was driven out of Azerbaijan by Isma'il, but retained his rule in Dvin. Isma'il died in 962, however, allowing Ibrahim to occupy Azerbaijan. He then invaded Tarum and forced Wahsudan to flee to Dailaman. In 966 Ibrahim was defeated by an army of Wahsudan's and his soldiers subsequently deserted him. He fled to his brother-in-law, the Buyid Rukn al-Dawla, while Wahsudan installed his son Nuh ibn Wahsudan in Azerbaijan. Rukn al-Dawla sent an army under his vizier Abu 'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid to reinstate Ibrahim in Azerbaijan, and Wahsudan was ejected from Tarum for a time. In 967 however he again sent an army, which burnt Ardabil before Ibrahim concluded a peace with his uncle, ceding part of Azerbaijan to him. In 968 he reaffirmed Sallarid authority over Shirvan, forcing the Shirvanshah to pay him tribute. Ibrahim's authority began to decline in the latter part of his reign. In 971 the Shaddadids took Ganja, and Ibrahim was forced to recognize their rule in that city after a siege failed to dislodge them. In around 979 he was deposed and imprisoned; he died in 983. His deposition marked the end of the Sallarids as a major power in Azerbaijan, as the Rawadids of Tabriz overran much of the province. The successor of Ibrahim, Marzuban II ibn Ismail, managed to retain a small portion of Azerbaijan until 984 when he was captured by the Rawadids.

Biography  Charles Moran was born in Brussels, Belgium, in 1811. He came to New York City while a young man and engaged in business, becoming in time senior partner in the dry- goods commission and importing house of Moran & Iselin. This firm was dissolved in 1852, Mr. Moran retiring. He had won an enviable reputation as a careful and successful business man, and as his bent was toward finance, he founded the New York banking-house of Moran Bros. The foreign correspondence of the house was particularly extensive and of high class, which fact gave Mr. Moran extraordinary opportunity for the placing of American loans abroad. It was his success in this way in 1856, with a large Erie loan, that made him a conspicuous figure in railroad financiering, and turned the attention of the Erie toward him in a time of emergency, and induced it to call him to the management of its critical affairs. He became president of the Company on the eve of the great financial upheaval of 1857, the disastrous effects of which harassed and hampered his earnest efforts in the herculean task he had undertaken, all through his two years' administration. Few men would have faced the obstacles he encountered, much less have attempted to overcome them. Mr. Moran retired from the Erie management, August 1859, and gave his entire attention to his banking business. He continued as senior partner of the house he founded until his death, July 22, 1895. Charles Moran had two sons, Amedee Depau Moran and D. Comyn Moran, who succeeded him in his banking business.  Work = Election as director in 1854  Listing of Erie directors and officers, 1855‚Äì56 In 1854 Charles Moran, broker and private banker, and Louis Von Hoffman, private banker, both from New York City, were elected among the sixteen directors of the New York and Erie Company. This election was in recognition of the interests of foreign creditors of the Company, Moran having placed a large amount of the Company's unsecured, or income, bonds in Switzerland and other parts of Europe. Moran would soon become one of Homer Ramsdell's confidant. When in 1854, Ramsdell acquired the land besides water frontage at the Hudson River, where the immense Erie Railroad yards, depots, ferry would be situated, nobody of the board knew except Charles Moran, They thought it was in the best for the interests of the Company that for new railroads, improvements, and lake steam, the matter should not be talked about. The boats. Work on the terminal facilities at Jersey City was begun in 1856. In June of that year the Mallory & Co. of Newburgh for putting the tunnel through Bergen Hill, which would be finished under James P. Kirkwood.  Selection as President  In 1857, misfortune marked Erie, and it was evident that the Company's affairs were once more approaching a crisis. This was the situation that confronted the Erie when Charles Moran returned from Europe in July 1857, where he had gone the previous winter to raise loans. Homer Ramsdell had private enterprises of much magnitude, and the increasing depression in the business affairs of the Company, he declared, required that he should give them more of his personal attention, and he announced his determination to resign the Presidency of the Company. The board of directors had been led to believe that Charles Moran, better than any other person available, could take hold of the Company's critical affairs and straighten them out. They notified him of their belief, and solicited him to take charge of the management. He replied that he would undertake the task, with assurances that he could perform it if the Company would pay him $25,000 a year for his services. This was as much as the President of the United States was paid, and an unheard-of salary for the executive head of any corporation. The Board decided, however, that Moran was worth the outlay, and they agreed to his terms. July 18, 1887, William E. Dodge, who was outraged because the Company persisted in permitting work to be done on the railroad on Sunday, resigned from the Board. Moran was chosen in his place, and was unanimously elected President, Mr. Ramsdell continuing as a member of the Board. It was announced of Mr. Moran in the public prints, upon his election as President of the Erie, that he was a man of high character and integrity, of vigorous mind, and devoted to the study of political economy, which was at the foundation of the success of any work of this description; that he had superior administrative ability, and that his election would give great satisfaction to all true friends of the enterprise, both at home and abroad. All this about Mr. Moran was undoubtedly true, but within the next two years he was to learn by bitter experience that it required something more than devotion to the study of political economy to be at the foundation of the success of such a work as the New York and Erie Railroad was.  Moran's policy changes  Free Pass by Moran, 1859 Erie financial conditions, 1857 Early in his incumbency, President Moran demonstrated that his policy was to be radically different in the management of the Company's affairs from that of any of his predecessors. It had been the custom, as a bid for new business and an inducement to retain old, to issue free passes to drovers who accompanied their cattle to market on the stock trains, and to \\"freighters.\\" who controlled produce shipments in those days. There were about 160 persons receiving these free tickets, and the issuing of them had been regarded as good business policy by all managements up to the Moran control. Moran did not believe it was a sound business principle, and he abolished the free pass system at once. He also dispensed with agencies, runners, advertisements, and all such methods of increasing the Company's business. Money was necessary to carry forward the improvements the Company had then in hand, but which were being delayed by lack of funds, so a scheme for a fourth mortgage loan was announced early in August 1857. It was proposed to raise $3,000,000 by creating a stock for $6,000,000, half to be paid in cash and half in the unsecured bonds of the Company. The object of the loan was to fund the debt of the Company, and to obtain means to continue the construction of the Bergen tunnel, the depots, wharves and other improvements of the Long Dock property. It was calculated that the debt of the Company would be increased but about $1,000,000 by this plan. It was a discouraging time for negotiating loans, however, even on the most approved security, for it was at the height of the panic of 1857 when banks were failing by the score, and the oldest business houses were trembling on the verge of bankruptcy; but President Moran and his associates went to work- in earnest to place the new bonds. The unsecured bonds of the Company were low in the market being then quoted at about thirty- five and the terms of the new issue were favorable, but investors ignored it. A meeting of the stock and bondholders held at No. 13 Broad Street, New York, September 23, 1857. For the purpose of inducing them to subscribe for the new loan. President Moran made an address which is to-day a graphic and in some respects an amusing ‚Äì exhibit of the Company's situation and tribulations in that critical year. He began by presenting a statement of the financial condition of the Company (see image).  December 1857 Strike  The most important difficulty the road had to contend with, Moran explained in 1857, was the engineers' strike of the fall of 1856: :... Owing to a policy which occupied itself with minutiae to the exclusion of the main chance, the best set of engineers ever gathered in this country was dispersed. They spread reports all over the country unfavorable to the Erie road; they said it was served by incompetent engineers, by mere boys, and what they said was in part true. The strike was followed by a December and a January change in weather by which the road was blocked by snows, and an inundation in February which destroyed the most important bridges on the line. Constant rains kept the road in a state of liquefaction until July, and the result of all this was that during the first six months of the present fiscal year there had been a diminution of receipts of $534,000, and an increase of expenditure of $482,000, leaving a comparative balance against the Company of $1,016,000. Notwithstanding this loss the road has gone ahead within the last two years between four hundred and five hundred thousand dollars. If, under such unfavorable circumstances as these, such results could be obtained, what would they not be when the large crops of this year came in, and when economical and active management had made the road as productive as possible? Piermont and Erie Railroad terminal in the 1850s. By the end of the year on Tuesday, December 1, 1887, by order of President Charles Moran, a reduction of wages and salaries of employees went into effect, owing to the hard times and the critical condition There were 250 laborers at the pier at Piermont, handling freight. They were divided into night and day gangs, and were known as laborers, checkers, tally clerks, porters, and stowers. Their pay had been $1 per day. It was reduced to 90 cents for eleven hours' work. Six hours were reckoned half a day's work. Steady men could make from $25 to $30 a month at the old wages. President Moran was getting a salary of $25,000 a year, and it was current all along the railroad that, owing to financial straits the Company was in, he was taking no chances, but was collecting his salary, pro rata, every day. When his order to reduce wages and salaries was issued, inquiry was made by the men as to whether the president hid submitted to a reduction in his own great stipend. When it was learned that he had not, the feeling was bitter, and the laborers at the Piermont docks protested against the cut in their wages and quit work. The brakemen on that division of the railroad joined the laborers, as did the laborers along the division. Traffic came to a standstill. The strike was broken later that week by Metropolitan policemen and Piermont Guards. These strikes would eventually cost the Company half a million to a million dollars.  Bankruptcy and resignation  The last \\"Address of the Directors of the New York and Erie Railroad Company to the Stockholders\\", early 1859 gave an impression of the depressing situation, stating with: New York and Erie Railroad Company's affairs, 1852‚Äì56 :\\"The depression in the market value of the Shares and Bonds of the New York and Erie R. R. Company, increasing from month to month and from week to week, indicates a fear that the whole stock may in a short time be lost, and some of the unsecured debt share the same fate. These fears are not without foundation, but they may by energetic proceedings be removed. It is evidently to the forbearance of the Creditors that the Company owes its continued existence. This lenity must grow out of the belief that there is a real, though at present unavailable, value in the property of the Company, which in time will again become apparent...\\" The address further gives an overview of companies development in the 1850s, and continued to stipulate its decline, and its origins: :\\"...remembering as they may, that for four years, commencing on 1 October 1852, when the trains first ran through from Jersey City to Dunkirk, and ending September 30, 1856, the earnings over all working expenses paid the interest on the debts, and left a surplus more than sufficient to pay full interest to the Stockholders; though 'part of that surplus went to the general improvements. The figures and facts are not to be found in any one publication,' and therefore may with advantage be collected here, as the commencement of an attempt to understand the real condition of the Company's affairs.\\" :\\"The 30 September 1856, marks the culminating point in the success of the Company. The road was good, and its equipments in cars, locomotives and every thing necessary for doing a large business, were nearly all that could be desired. From thence, its decline may be dated. The old and experienced enginemen were at that time discharged. Those substituted for them, though competent and careful, could not at once run the trains as economically as had before been usual. But they acquitted themselves well. No accident happened to car or passenger in the months of October, November and December; and the earnings of the road for that period, being the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1857, amounted to $1,605,582.42, a. sum which with one exception had never been exceeded in the same quarter. It left, after paying all working expenses and interest on the bonded and floating debt, as net surplus earnings, $207,447.53. After this, the real decline began, with a hard winter, destructive spring freshets, and imaginary improvements by a new President...\\" This Address continued with more recent events, but couldn't turn the tide. Up to August 1859, of the loan only $1,253,500 had been taken. The hopeless state of entanglement in the affairs of the Company culminated on the 4th of that month in the recovery of a judgment against it for $35,000 default in sinking fund bonds, and an execution was issued the same day. Other suits were pending in which the same questions were involved, and it became plain that if the bondholders wished to protect the property of the corporation, and hold it together against a reorganization, some steps must be taken at once. Erie bond dept and capital stock, 1859. Proceedings were begun by the trustees of the fourth mortgage, default having also been made on the first, second, third, and fifth mortgages. On motion thus made, Nathaniel Marsh, Secretary of the Company, was appointed Receiver by Judge Mason of Chenango County. He took possession of the road on August 16, 1859. On the 19th the Directors made a large reduction in President Moran's salary. On the 27th he resigned as President, and retired from the Directory. Samuel Marsh was elected President to succeed him. When Moran left the capital stock of the Company was $11,000,000 and the bonded debt $36,783,650 (see image). Erie stock in July 1857, when the Moran administration began, was quoted at thirty- three and one-third. In August 1859, when the Moran administration ended, the stock was wavering at eight. That Charles Moran made earnest and conscientious endeavor to extricate the Company from its troubles and start it forward on a successful career it would be unjust to doubt. According to Mott (1899; p. 129) \\"his ability to do so had been simply misjudged and overrated ‚Äì and by nobody more than by himself.\\"  Money, 1863  Title page Money, 1863. In 1851 Moran had published in the local press some of his views in regard to the relative value of gold and silver, and the effects of the large influx of gold from new mines. In the 1860s he further developed these ideas in discussions at the meetings of the Society for the Advancement of Political and Social Science in New York City. This gradually assumed the form of a work, which is an attempt to analyze and discuss the subject of money, in its most important, practical phases. Moran wanted to describe this subject more fully than has been done in any of the works that have, and explain and reconcile all the anomalies that, heretofore, have rendered money so vexed a subject. His 1863 book \\"Money\\" build on his earlier publications. Moran further explains, that \\"every prediction then made on this subject has been fully realized, while not one of those made by the partisans of the theory of the future depreciation of gold and appreciation of silver has been fulfilled. The conclusions in regard to the effect on prices, of bank-note issues, were arrived at and communicated to friends long before reading trie able works of Fullarton and Tooke, in which similar views are maintained. This is mentioned here, not so much to claim the merit of originality for these conclusions, as with a view to obtain for them the weight due to conclusions arrived at by different parties, examining the same subject from different points of view.\\" A late 1863 review in British Westminster Review, commented, that \\"Mr. Moran's Essay on Money is but another added to the heap of such publications as have long since tired all human patience. Writers of his school will never be brought to recognise the difference between currency and credit. Their theory is, that because credit is the basis of all extended commerce, the banking system of a country should be so constituted as to come to the rescue of a credit destroyed by injudicious investments in times of overtrading and speculation...\\"  Owner of the Nevada and California Railroad  The Nevada and Oregon Railroad, a narrow gauge line found in 1882 building from north from Reno was sold to their largest investor, the Moran Brothers, a group of New York investors, at foreclosure in 1884 and operated unofficially as the Nevada and California Railroad. In 1893 the Moran Brothers sold the railroad and it was reorganized as the Nevada‚ÄìCalifornia‚ÄìOregon Railway.

The paper was founded in 1913. CBS News journalist Dan Rather served as editor of the newspaper before his graduation from SHSU in 1953. In 1994, the university named the headquarters of the paper the Dan Rather Communications Building. Before his 2005 retirement, CBS created the Dan Rather Scholarship Fund in honor of the journalist, with preference towards those working at The Houstonian. The university hired investigative journalist Craig Flournoy in 1997 to both teach journalism at the school and supervise production at The Houstonian. During the 1997-1998 period, the students reported on key issues at the school, including instances of inflated grades by professors, rape occurrences at the school, and a revealing Texas state audit performed on the university. Prior to her 1997 graduation from SHSU, Jenna Jackson served as editor of The Houstonian. She went on to join CBS News in New York, and won an Emmy Award in 2012 for her work on the television program 48 Hours. Jackson later returned to Texas and advised journalism students at SHSU in the College of Fine Arts and Mass Communication. History Newspaper staff in 1932 Newspaper staff in 1960 The Houstonian was founded in 1913 at Sam Houston State University (SHSU). The paper produces two editions per week. Dan Rather graduated from SHSU in 1953 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism. During 1952, Rather had served as editor of the paper. The Houstonian is headquartered in the Dan Rather Communications Building at SHSU. The university named the building after Rather in 1994. Prior to his 2005 retirement, CBS created a scholarship program at SHSU, titled the Dan Rather Scholarship Fund. The fund was intended for students focusing on studies of journalism. Rather asked CBS to specify that the fund should give students preferential status for selection to the program if they worked either on a volunteer or paid arrangement for The Houstonian. After graduating from Grayson College in 1967, Don Eldredge went on to further studies at SHSU where he became editor of The Houstonian. Eldredge subsequently became editor of The Herald Democrat in Sherman, Texas. Craig Flournoy was brought on by SHSU in 1997 both to instruct students in journalism and serve as an advisor for The Houstonian. During the 1997-1998 period, the students reported on key issues at the school, including instances of inflated grades by professors, rape occurrences at the school, and a revealing Texas state audit performed on the university. The Houstonian was first to report that a state audit performed on the university revealed that due to poor supervision from the president, the auditor of the university itself had not performed its task adequately. In response the president of the university both denied there was an issue and simultaneously switched to a different auditor. The students produced 19 articles reporting on incidents of rape at the university. School officials stated that in the previous five years there had been zero rapes reported at the university. Journalists at The Houstonian uncovered information documenting that in the previous 20 months there were seven reports of rape by attendees of SHSU. The paper reported that grade inflation was a significant ongoing issue at the school. The most senior academic official at the university denied there was an issue at the school with grade inflation. One week before this school official gave this statement, seven professors from the communications division of academics at the university (reflecting twenty- five percent of the total faculty in the department) stated they had handed in inflated grades. Jenna Jackson served as editor of The Houstonian prior to her graduation from SHSU in 1997 with a B.A. in political science and journalism. She went on to work for CBS News in New York. While working at 48 Hours for CBS, she received an Emmy Award in 2012. Jackson came back to Texas and launched P&R; Productions, a company focusing on producing films and documentaries. Jackson came back to SHSU to gives talks to students in the College of Fine Arts and Mass Communication. Kuyk Logan joined SHSU in 2002 to serve as the Philip G. Warner Endowed Chair in Journalism until 2004. Logan came in for the outgoing Ardyth Sohn who had served in the role from 2000. Logan was faculty adviser for The Houstonian in this role. Prior to his appointment, Logan had served at KHOU-TV and the Houston Post as managing editor. In 2012 the paper was cited by CNN for advice on senioritis, a period of time when upperclassmen in college feel lack of motivation for studies due to impending graduation. CNN noted that the paper advised students to fully utilize resources during their time at the educational institution. The Houstonian recommended students seek out assistance from tutoring services, study in the library, and dedicate themselves to full engagement in the classroom setting. The editor-in-chief of The Houstonian in 2013 was Stephen Green; he simultaneously worked as a staff reporter for The Huntsville Item. The editor-in-chief of The Houstonian in 2014-2015 is Jay R.

It was revealed that Cope was recorded entirely in the band's recently completed home studio, and the album was described as an \\"unrelenting and unapologetically heavy 38 minutes of rock.\\" Lead singer and songwriter Andy Hull went on to explain the tone of the album: \\"We wanted to make the kind of album that's missing at this time in rock: something that's just brutal and pounding you over the head every track [...] Whereas Simple Math was a different palate with each song, a different color, I wanted this to be black and red the whole time.\\" Critical reception Cope mainly received positive feedback from critics upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on 18 reviews, indicating 'generally positive reviews'.

Many fossils he uncovered during his extensive field work are still exhibited at Amherst's Beneski Museum of Natural History. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the Geological Society of America, and president of the Paleontological Society.

In 1892 Loomis entered Amherst College, where he joined Phi Delta Theta. After graduating in 1896 he remained at Amherst for a year as a research assistant in biology. In the fall of 1897 he entered the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich to study under Karl Alfred von Zittel. He earned his Ph.D. from LMU in 1899. Career After earning his Ph.D. Loomis returned to Amherst, where he remained on the faculty until his death. He was first an Instructor in the Department of Biology. He was named Associate Professor of Biology in 1903, Professor of Comparative Anatomy in 1908, and Professor of Geology in 1917. He also served as Vice President of the College and held this office at the time of his death. Loomis was chiefly a vertebrate paleontologist, and most of his published research is in this area. He was highly active in field work. Most notably, a 1911 expedition to Patagonia funded by Loomis's Amherst Class of 1896 yielded several remarkable fossils of the extinct mammal Pyrotherium. He also explored areas of the Rocky Mountains, Florida and Maine, returning to Amherst with fossils of vertebrates including Eohippus, mastodons, and mammoths.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Chater held faculty appointments in nursing and education at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the University of California, Berkeley, respectively. She worked as an administrator at UCSF and then worked for two national education councils. Chater was president of Texas Woman's University from 1986 to 1993. She left TWU to serve as Commissioner of Social Security from 1993 to 1997. She helped the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation develop the Executive Nurse Fellows program. Chater was named a Living Legend of the American Academy of Nursing in 2000. Early life Born on July 30, 1932 in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, Chater received an undergraduate degree in nursing from the University of Pennsylvania. After finishing her nursing degree, she applied to an international exchange program sponsored by the American Nurses Association. The program sent Chater to London, where she worked at St Bartholomew's Hospital for a year. Chater noted how much the St Bartholomew's nurses controlled their units; they locked the unit doors until they were ready for physicians to begin rounds.Houser, pp. 24-26. Upon returning to Pennsylvania, Chater worked as a nursing faculty member. She wanted to begin graduate school at Penn, but a faculty mentor encouraged her to attend an out- of-state program to gain different perspectives.Houser, p. 26. Chater completed an M.S. in nursing from UCSF. While she was a student at UCSF, Chater married neurosurgery resident Norman Chater and became pregnant with the first of two children a year later. She was asked to leave graduate school when she got pregnant, but she was able convince the school to let her remain in the program.Houser, p. 27. She earned a Ph.D. in education from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964. Career=Early academic career When her children were young, Chater worked part-time in education and in private duty nursing.Houser, p. 28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Chater held faculty appointments in nursing at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and in the education department at the University of California, Berkeley, respectively. She was Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at UCSF from 1977 to 1982, which made her the highest ranking woman in the UC system. She was nominated for chancellor at UCSF, but Chater realized that no non- physician had ever held the position and she withdrew from consideration.Houser, p. 30. In the mid-1980s, she worked for the American Council on Education (ACE), which involved traveling between California and Washington, DC. Presidency at TWU While on sabbatical from UCSF and working with ACE in Washington, DC, in 1986, Texas Woman's University (TWU) nominated Chater as a candidate for university president. About half of TWU's academic offerings were in the health sciences, which made Chater a unique fit. She accepted the position in July 1986 and began there three months later. A state commission had just been formed to investigate whether some of the state's 37 public colleges could be merged. Between the time that Chater accepted the position and the time that she started, the commission proposed that TWU should be merged with the University of North Texas (UNT). In testimony before the commission, Chater pointed out that TWU was the nation's only public university primarily for women.Houser, pp. 30-32. The commission in Texas cancelled the proposed merger of TWU and UNT about two months after Chater's arrival at TWU.Houser, p. 32. Officials at TWU and the City of Denton credited her with focusing the university on a consistent mission. Upon her arrival, TWU had 33 academic programs with two or fewer graduates in the previous six years total. Chater led an effort that reorganized the university from a system of 11 schools into eight schools.Houser, p. 33. In 1991, Chater was one of three finalists for the position of chancellor of California State University; Barry Munitz, a former chancellor of the University of Houston, was selected for the position. Social Security Administration Chater was sworn in as Commissioner of Social Security in October 1993. Shortly after taking office, she said that while there were no immediate plans to raise the retirement age, the issue would have to be examined. She cited the increasing life expectancy of people in the decades following the creation of Social Security. In 1994, the Social Security Administration was broken off from the Department of Health and Human Services, with Chater reporting directly to the president. The same legislation gave her office a six-year term. In January 1995, Clinton nominated Chater to a six-year term. At her confirmation hearing the next month, she faced stern criticism from Senate Finance Committee chairman Bob Packwood. He accused her of not providing specific solutions to prevent Social Security from heading toward bankruptcy. The Senate Finance Committee did not act on Chater's nomination for the six-year term, meaning that she would only be able to serve through Clinton's term as president. An article in The Baltimore Sun said that the failed nomination hurt morale at the agency and may have undermined Chater's power with Congress. Chater announced her resignation from the Social Security Administration in the fall of 1996, effective January 31, 1997. In her resignation letter, Chater mentioned that she wanted to spend more time with her family. Later career After her service with Social Security, Chater joined the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. She helped to develop the Executive Nurse Fellows program and served as its national advisory committee chair. The program is a three-year mentoring and education program for future nurse leaders. She was named a Living Legend of the American Academy of Nursing in 2000. In 2011, Chater joined the board of directors of the Galen College of Nursing.

It is then later revealed that Ruby didn't chose her as a true Lady Candidate, but by a mysterious person who brought her into the Jewel Palace during the wedding. Her desire on becoming a Lady Jewel is after she receives a message from Lady Diana during her first test and goes on a quest to become a Lady who is caring just like Lady Diana.

He became emeritus professor of biophysics at the Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble in September 2007, and chairman of the board of the Edmond J. Safra Biomedical Research Center in 2009 at Clinatec, a multidisciplinary institute he co-founded in Grenoble that applies nanotechnologies to neurosciences.  Biography  Alim Louis Benabid was born May 2, 1942, in Grenoble, France. The son of a doctor from Algeria and of a French nurse, Benabid was quoted as saying he could not easily decide between studying physics or medicine. He received his medical degree in 1970 and a doctorate in physics in 1978, both from Joseph Fourier University (now part of the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes) in Grenoble. He became a staff neurosurgeon at Joseph Fourier University in 1972, professor of experimental medicine in 1978, and professor of biophysics from 1983 to 2007. Benabid also had a fellowship in 1979 ‚Äì 1980 in preclinical neuropharmacology in the laboratory of Floyd Bloom at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. From 1988 to 2007, he directed the preclinical neurosciences unit at the French biomedical and public health research institution INSERM, and from 1989 to 2007, served as head of the neurosurgery department at the University Hospital of Grenoble. In other roles, Benabid coordinated the Claudio Munari Center for Surgery of Epilepsy and Movement Disorders at Ospedale (Hospital) Niguarda in Milan, Italy from 1998 to 2007, and was a staff consultant at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio from 2000 to 2003. In 2007, Benabid joined the French Commissariat d‚ÄôEnergie Atomique as a scientific adviser during the time a campus for public-private innovation was being created, the Grenoble Innovation for Advanced New Technologies campus, which includes the Minatec research complex and the life-science cluster NanoBio.:fr:NanoBio In 2009, he became chairman of the board of the Edmond J. Safra Biomedical Research Center at Clinatec, a translational biomedical technology organization he helped found within Minatec. Clinatec was jointly created by CEA-LETI (Laboratoire d'√©lectronique des technologies de l'information‚Äîan applied micro- and nanotechnology subsidiary of CEA), Grenoble University Hospital, INSERM and Joseph Fourier University. In 2013, when awarding Benabid a $100,000 Robert A. Pritzker Prize for Leadership in Parkinson's Research to fund continued research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation said in its award announcement that Benabid had published 523 scientific papers, achieving an H Index of 67, as well as given 18 honorary lectures, and received 23 medals and prizes.  Deep brain stimulation neurosurgery  Benabid developed stereotactic surgery methods for brain surgery in patients who had brain tumors or certain types of movement disorder. As part of the work, he and his team members created tissue banks using tissue from brain tumor biopsies. The tissue samples were used to characterize brain tumors by oncogenic mapping. Studies of genomics and proteomics have highlighted the factors involved in tumor progression and led to therapeutic advances such as anti-angiogenic factors. For patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, Benabid and Pierre Pollak, a neurologist at the University Hospital of Grenoble, also developed deep brain stimulation (DBS) in 1987. Parkinson's disease is commonly treated with medicines such as levodopa to improve muscle control, balance and walking, but higher dosages tend to be needed over time in this progressive neurological condition, and long-term use can lead to motor fluctuations such as tremor, rigidity or slowness. Prior to development of DBS, the main surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease was lesioning to inhibit involuntary abnormal motion associated with severe Parkinson's disease not controlled by optimal medication. As described in a 2010 interview with Benabid in the medical journal Lancet, electrical stimulation was used during surgery to locate the ablation target and predict lesioning effects. To precisely locate the right area, an electrode would be placed around the target and those surrounding areas stimulated with physiological frequencies of 20 ‚Äì 50 Hz while observing the patient's movement. Since electrical stimulation itself sometimes seemed to quiet tremor during the procedure, Benabid reasoned this might be a solution. He tested from very low frequencies of 1, 5, 10 Hz and more up to 100 Hz, which mimicked effects of ablation without destroying tissue. Initially the thalamus was stimulated. Later animal studies indicated the subthalamic nucleus might be a more effective stimulation target. As technology advanced to allow such stimulation to be continuously applied for a long time, DBS became widely adopted in the 1990s for treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. A meta- analysis of six randomized controlled trials published in 2014 showed that in 1,184 study subjects, DBS significantly improved untreated motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, permitting a reduction in medication doses and their associated complications; as well as contributing moderately, during the phase when the patients were taking Parkinson's disease medication, to fewer motor symptoms, greater function, and more quality of life.  Honors and awards  Benabid has received a number of awards and honors from various countries, including: Honorary degrees * Honorary degree, National University of Ireland, Galway (2005) * Honorary degree, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada * Honorary degree, McGill University, Montreal, Canada  See also  * Stereotactic surgery  References External links *Michael J.

It is located on 401 East Eager Street in downtown Baltimore, Maryland. It has been a state facility since July 1991. In July 2015, Maryland governor Larry Hogan announced the men's facility would be permanently closed, and the 750 inmates redistributed among other more modern facilities. The exact date of the closure was not made known.  Correctional campus  The Center is one element of a correctional campus that also includes: * the Baltimore City Correctional Center at 901 Greenmount Avenue, also a state facility * Maryland's Metropolitan Transition Center at 954 Forrest Street, first established 1811 as the Maryland Penitentiary, site of the state's (now-decommissioned) execution chamber * the Chesapeake Detention Facility at 401 East Madison Street, formerly known as the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center The BCDC ranks among the top 20 largest detention facilities in the United States. With a working capacity of 4,000 prisoners, the five buildings of the BCDC also represent one of the oldest prisons in the country. About 90% of detainees are pretrial detainees.Baltimore Behind Bars (2010), pages 5 and 12 History and conditions Baltimore's first jail was built in 1801 and was used until a new facility was built in 1859.David F. Gaylin, Edgar Allan Poe's Baltimore (Arcadia: 2005), p. 43. In 1832, half the prisoners in Baltimore City Jail were imprisoned for debt; Edgar Allan Poe claimed to have been arrested for an unpaid debt shared with his brother Henry, who had died.Jeffrey Meyers, Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy (First Cooper Square, 2000), p. 62. Architects Thomas and James M. Dixon won the contract for the 1858 re-construction. An elaborate Gothic design by Gradley J.F. Bryant had been selected by the City Commissioner without authorization, and rescinded after protest. The building was gutted and re-constructed 1859-60. Only a small part of the 1859 building remains. The jail has a long and \\"checkered history\\" with a lengthy series of litigation over jail conditions.Jessica Anderson, What you need to know about the Baltimore jail's checkered history, Baltimore Sun (July 31, 2015). The Baltimore Sun was already reporting about poor conditions in the jail in 1885, and by 1938, some Baltimore City residents \\"were calling for the building to be demolished and replaced with a new facility.\\" The city Criminal Justice Commission president at the time, C. Delano Ames, called the jail a \\"disgrace to a metropolitan city\\" as well as \\"a sanitary menace, and a breeder of degeneracy.\\" City grand juries repeatedly recommended building a new jail; in 1940, a grand jury subcommittee recommended construction of a new jail, but stated: \\"the committee feels it is useless for them to lay any great stress upon this point as the recommendation has been made by every grand jury for the last 10 or 15 years without results.\\" In 1952, voters approved spending $6 million to build a new jail, but plans to build a new facility near City Hospital (now Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center) in East Baltimore attracted opposition from local residents. In 1962, the city decided to carry out an extensive renovation of the existing building instead. Initially estimated to cost $2 million, the first of three planned phases alone cost $3.8 million. The newly renovated facility could accommodate an inmate population of 1,500, including 200 female inmates. The new facility was dedicated in 1967; at the dedication ceremony, Mayor Theodore R. McKeldin said that \\"building a new structure is not enough. We need substantive rehabilitation programs for these men. ... They are an essential part of any crime-fighting program.\\" The jail continued to suffer problems, however; in 1972, the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported a \\"desperate lack of training among guards, lax security measures, poor sanitation and inadequate inmate rehabilitation programs\\" and well as poor morale among the then-273 guards. Also in 1972, black guards were promoted to captain for the first time. In 1977, four women became the first female guards to work in the men's wing of the jail. In 1979, a federal judge ruled that only one inmate could be housed in each cell. As a result, city officials announced a five-year jail renovation and expansion project. In 1987, after a ten-year lawsuit relating to jail overcrowding, the city agreed to provide 500 new beds for inmates and to cap the jail population at 2,622. A series of efforts to reduce the jail population failed, and by 1989, the jail's population was approaching 3,000, and Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke declared an emergency. In 1991, the state took over the facility from the city, changing its name from Baltimore City Jail to Baltimore City Detention Center. In 2002, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division determined that poor conditions at the facility \\"had contributed to the deaths of several detainees, some of whom received little or no medical attention for chronic health problems,\\" and had violated inmates' constitutional rights. In 2003, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Duvall v. Hogan, on behalf of jail inmates, alleging that the facility's poor conditions rose to the level of unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment.Detainees Reopen Baltimore Jail Lawsuit Over Dangers to Health and Safety: Poor Medical and Mental Health Care and Disintegrating, Filthy Infrastructure Put Detainees at Risk, American Civil Liberties Union (June 2, 2015).Dave Phillips, A.C.L.U.

Under the terms of the settlement, the government agreed to assessment detainees' medical needs upon entry; respond to \\"detainees' sick call requests within 72 hours and faster in emergencies,\\" provide \\"ongoing treatment for detainees with chronic diseases,\\" provide \\"an on-site psychiatrist available five days a week,\\" accommodate detainees with disabilities, and \\"fix broken plumbing in a timely manner.\\" In June 2015, the ACLU filed a motion to reopen the suit, arguing that the state had failed to meaningfully improve conditions. In its motion to reopen, ACLU attorneys wrote that BCDC was \\"a dank and dangerous place, where detainees are confined in dirty cells infested with vermin\\"; that the facility's showers \\"are full of drain flies, black mold and filth\\"; that at one point an entire section of the BCDC went without working sinks or toilets for several days, creating a \\"fetid and unhealthy\\" atmosphere \\"because the detainees had no way to dispose of their bodily wastes except by using the nonfunctional toilets\\"; and that temperatures at the jail often climb above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Gang activity prosecutions In 2013, following a multi- agency investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland indicted 44 individuals, including 27 Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services correctional officers and several others, including inmates, on federal various charges of racketeering, conspiracy, distribution of drugs, and money laundering inside BCDC and several connected facilities. The government alleges that the accused were affiliated with the Black Guerrilla Family. Among other details in the indictments, one inmate, Tavon White, fathered five children with four of the female guards since 2009. Two of the guards had the inmate's name tattooed on their bodies. White also claimed to earn at least $16,000 a month from drug and other contraband smuggling. By July 2015, forty of the 44 defendants had been convicted of crimes in the case.Christina Jedra, Forty-four charged in Baltimore jail scandal; here's how cases ended, Baltimore Sun (July 11, 2015). Twenty-four of the 27 correctional officers charged were convicted in the case, while three were acquitted. Of the 15 inmates and others, 14 were convicted and one died before the case was resolved. Among the convicted defendants was White, the Black Guerrilla Family ringleader who fathered children with four correctional officers; White pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years in prison in February 2015.

Following early jobs as a secretary and short story writer, Donoghue's first writing credit was the 1984 film The Buddy System. She went on to pen the screenplays for Beaches (1988) and Paradise (1991), which was also her directorial debut. Donoghue co-wrote and co-produced Deceived (1991) and two year later, her first play, Me and Mamie O'Rourke, made its debut at the Strand Theatre in London. In the 2000s, Donoghue wrote the screenplay for White Oleander (2002) and co-wrote Veronica Guerin (2003) with Carol Doyle. In 2013, Donoghue wrote and directed Jenny's Wedding. Early and personal life Donoghue was born in Queens, New York City. Before becoming a screenwriter, she worked various secretarial jobs. Donoghue was also a short story writer and poet. Donoghue lived with her partner, writer and journalist Chris Robbins for 19 years, before marrying him in 1996. Robbins died on December 24, 2012 from pancreatic cancer. Career Donoghue's first writing credit was the 1984 romantic comedy drama The Buddy System, starring Richard Dreyfuss and Susan Sarandon. Donoghue then adapted Iris Rainer Dart's 1985 novel Beaches for the screen. The film which starred Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey was released in 1988. During filming, the director Garry Marshall asked Donoghue to add \\"a couple more sugars\\" to the script. When she refused, Marshall fired her and hired a team of comedy writers to change the script. After three weeks, the head of the studio saw the script, which was described as being \\"really, really bad\\" and Donoghue's script was reinstated. Donoghue wrote the screenplay for the 1991 film Paradise, which was based on the 1987 French film Le Grand Chemin. Paradise also marked Donoghue's directorial debut. Donoghue said she learned that directing was not as easy as she thought it would be. In the same year, Donoghue co-wrote and co-produced Deceived with Derek Saunders. Donoghue described how the film came to her; \\"You're sitting there at night and look over at your husband or your wife and think: Who is this person? I was fascinated by the idea of having a middle-class safe existence, predictable; and then certain events take place that let you know that you know nothing about your own life and the people in it.\\" Two years later, Donoghue wrote her first play titled Me and Mamie O'Rourke. The play was staged at the Strand Theatre and starred British comedians Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders. It received mixed reviews from critics. In the 2000s, Donoghue wrote the screenplay for White Oleander (2002). Producer John Wells enlisted Donoghue to adapt White Oleander from the novel of the same name by Janet Fitch. Wells wanted the story to be presented on-screen as fully as possible. Donoghue also co-wrote Veronica Guerin (2003) with Carol Doyle. The biographical film focuses on the life of Irish journalist Veronica Guerin, who was murdered in 1996. Donoghue called the film \\"a story about personal courage.\\" Donoghue wrote, directed and produced Jenny's Wedding starring Katherine Heigl. Production wrapped in November 2013, but a crowd funding campaign was launched in February 2014 to help raise post-production finishing money.

The road stretched about 35 miles from the fortifications on Mount Independence in today's Orwell, Vermont, to Rutland (today's \\"Center Rutland\\") where it joined an older military road that ran diagonally from the ruins of the originally British fort Crown Point southeast to the Fort at Number 4 on the Connecticut River in Charlestown, New Hampshire. The Hubbardton Military Road was constructed in the fall of 1776 under orders from patriot Major General Horatio Gates. On July 6, 1777, most of the Continental Army's Northern Department, stationed on either side of Lake Champlain at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, retreated on the road and were pursued by British and German troops, culminating in a rear guard action, the Battle of Hubbardton, on the morning of July 7.John Williams, The Battle of Hubbardton: The American Rebels Stem the Tide.

It was released for Microsoft Windows in April 2014, and ports for Linux and OS X were released in June 2014. Mobile versions for Android and iOS were released in September 2014. Versions for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One were released in April 2015, and for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in August 2015; these ports were developed by Double Eleven. A Nintendo Switch version containing the game and downloadable content was released in January 2019. The game has been compared by the developer to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed at doing as much damage as possible around an open world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to build the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value. The game received mixed reviews; some reviewers praised the title for providing a humorous sandbox interface to experiment with, while others criticized the game's reliance on social media to popularize what was otherwise a simple and buggy product.  Gameplay  In Goat Simulator, the player acquires points by performing acts of chaos‚Äîin this case, getting struck by a car while licking a non-player human character. The game's novelty comes from various glitches in the game purposely left in place, such as the distortion of the human character's neck as a result of the collision. Goat Simulator is an open-ended third-person perspective game in which the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world ‚Äî a suburban setting ‚Äî as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player is not required to follow these instructions. Small gold goat statues are hidden in the game's world. Mutators are progressively unlocked by obtaining the statues. Mutators are toggleable within the main menu of the game. Each adds a unique mechanic and/or appearance to the standard goat, such as changing the goat model to a demon goat, a giraffe, or an ostrich, or adding a jetpack to the goat that can be activated at any time. Various easter eggs are scattered about the sandbox, such as a castle where one can become the Queen of all Goats, or where the goat character gains a move similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's spin attack. The game's lead developer Armin Ibrisagic noted after release that the game's setting is a parody of the concept of Purgatory, having left references to Heaven and Hell that were later found by fans. Ibrisagic also noted the inclusion of some elements based on the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.  Development  Goat Simulator was originally intended to imitate QWOP (pictured), whose title refers to the four keyboard keys used to move the muscles of the sprinter avatar Game designer Armin Ibrisagic presents on Goat Simulator at the 2016 Game Developers Conference Goat Simulator started as a joke prototype from an internal one-month game jam held by Coffee Stain Studios in January 2014, after completing work for their game Sanctum 2. The game was described by the lead developer Armin Ibrisagic as \\"an old school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff\\". The idea followed after originally pitching the game as a variation of QWOP, where the player would control the individual limbs of the goat separately with various keyboard keys; this concept was rejected in favor of the more Tony Hawk's Pro Skater-type of gameplay the final game presents. Ibrisagic had focused on goats after jokingly trying to convince his coworkers that goats would achieve viral attention on the Internet in much the same way that cats presently do. The prototype used Nvidia PhysX and an Apex physics engine with ragdoll physics for the goat and human models within Unreal Engine 3, a game engine they were familiar with from the Sanctum series. In-game assets were purchased from third-party vendors instead of developed in-house, such as the original goat model which the studio acquired for use for less than $20. The prototype was meant to be a parody of various other \\"weirdly successful\\" Simulation games presently available, such as Euro Truck Simulator. Ibrisagic had no intention of this becoming a full title, instead only offering the prototype for him and other developers to learn the Unreal Engine alongside other developers that were developing prototypes in more earnest. Footage of the game in its alpha state was posted to YouTube by Coffee Stain, where it received more than a million views in two days and a large response from fans requesting a full release of the game in part due to various glitches in the prototype's engine. The appeal of the video was also picked up by the agricultural magazine Modern Farmer. Some journalists suggested that the title be developed into a full game even knowing it was meant as a joking title; GameSpot editor Danny O'Dwyer supported the full release of the game arguing that \\"games should be dumb once in a while\\". The large positive response to the alpha footage convinced the studio to develop Goat Simulator as a full title to Steam, putting more people on the title. The team, having no plans for a full release, debated on whether to approach a large publisher to receive funding to help make the title into something like Grand Theft Auto, but decided to stay with a small, inexpensive title that would be truer to the teaser video. Recognizing that the glitching was part of the game's appeal, Ibrisagic only sought to fix software bugs that might cause the game to crash, leaving in the other glitches and bugs associated with the physics engine as the results from these were \\"really hilarious\\". They limited themselves to a short development time of four weeks without significant management oversight as to set an urgent but realistic goal to bring the game to a playable state. Ibrisagic felt it was important for the game to be supported on Steam, but initially feared that Valve would not accept the quirky title. He instead found Valve to be welcoming of the title, including a joking response from the company that stated \\"[Valve's marketing manager DJ Powers] has started wearing a goat costume to work he‚Äôs so excited about this game\\". As part of its release, Coffee Stain added support for Steam Workshop which would let players modify the game, aware that players would likely create levels and scenarios that will glitch and crash the game for humorous results. While the physics engine allows for spectacular rendering of destruction of the game environment, which is a main feature of the game, Coffee Stain acknowledged the downside of this as \\"it would synchronise terribly in multiplayer\\". They estimated that adding multiplayer would remove \\"90 percent of the physics\\" and many other features, and left the game as a single player title at launch. The studio considered that it only spent a couple months to complete the Windows version, and opted to outsource versions for OS X and Linux, with Ryan Gordon handling the porting.  Release and promotion  Coffee Stain Studios released Goat Simulator worldwide on 1 April 2014, aware that tying the date with April Fools' Day may raise doubts on the validity of the game. Those that pre- ordered the game through Coffee Stain's website received early access to the title three days ahead of release. The official release trailer for Goat Simulator is a loose parody of the Dead Island announcement trailer showing, among shots of the game, reversed slow-motion footage of the goat crashing through a building after being launched from an exploding gas station. The studio released a free expansion and patch to the game on 3 June 2014, which in addition to fixing game-breaking issues, added new goat models, a new map to explore based on a seaside town with a carnival, more game-breaking issues, and local multiplayer for up to 4 players via split-screen. Ibrisagic believes that adding multiplayer support atop Steam Workshop support will allow creative users to develop new gameplay modes that will extend the title's playability. The patch also adds in additional controls that the player can use to make the goat perform various freestyle tricks comparable to those in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The studio released a second free patch to the game on 20 November 2014 including elements that parody massive multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft, though remains a single player or local multiplayer experience. A paid-content expansion titled \\"GoatZ\\" was released on 7 May 2015 as downloadable content for the game on personal computers and a stand-alone application for mobile devices. It was developed by Coffee Stain's partner studio Gone North Games. The expansion's content spoofs zombie-based survival games, such as DayZ, and includes a new map and gameplay aspects such as fighting off zombies and crafting. The title itself plays off DayZ as well as a play on the Internet meme goatse.cx. In a cross-promotional \\"GoatBread\\" update with Bossa Studios' I Am Bread to be offered in late 2015, a free update to Goat Simulator will allow the players to select a piece of bread as their avatar, while I Am Bread will add in a \\"RAMpage\\" mode based on Goat Simulator. Another add-on, the \\"Super Secret DLC\\" package part of a cross- promotion with Overkill Software's Payday 2; the Payday-inspired content for Goat Simulator included additional playable characters including a camel, flamingo, and a dolphin in a wheelchair, while Goat Simulator content will be added to Payday 2. These were released in January 2016. Goat Simulator decorative content was added to Rocket League in a mid-2016 update. Another expansion, \\"Waste of Space\\", was again developed by Gone North Games and released on 26 May 2016. The expansion features a new map based on a space colony, and spoofs much of the recent science fiction media genre. The OS X and Linux ports were released on 27 June 2014. Following the game's digital release, Koch Media agreed to distribute the game in UK and EU retail stores starting in May 2014. Similarly, Deep Silver approached Coffee Stain Studios to work out a deal to publish the title in North American retail markets starting in July 2014. At Microsoft's presentation at the 2014 Gamescom convention in August, Goat Simulator was announced as one of several titles to be coming to the Xbox One platform with the help of Double Eleven studios, and later confirmed to be also arriving for the Xbox 360, with both versions released on 17 April 2015. Koch Media also distributed a retail version of the Xbox One version, including all additional downloadable content, across Europe for release on 4 March 2016. Coffee Stain Studios also released ports for iOS and Android in September 2014. Each DLC is a separate app for iOS and Android, and each one (except Goat Simulator: Payday) includes a mobile-exclusive map. PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 versions, also ported by Double Eleven, were released on 11 August 2015. With the acquisition of Coffee Stain through THQ Nordic AB on 14 November 2018, it was announced that a Nintendo Switch version of Goat Simulator would be released. Goat Simulator: The GOATY, which includes all expansions to date, was released on 23 January 2019.  Reception  Goat Simulator received \\"mixed\\" reviews upon release, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Goat Simulator was named as an honorable mention for Excellence in Audio for the 2015 Independent Games Festival. Eurogamer Dan Whitehead complimented Coffee Stain Studios on building in enough content Goat Simulator and potential expansion through Steam to prove it more than a simple joke title, and instead a brief diversion \\"in which the player is a willing participant\\". Dan Stapleton of IGN considered the title a \\"clever interactive spoof of all the broken game physics we‚Äôve seen in open worlds\\" and despite being short, was a \\"hell of a good time\\". Tim Turi of Game Informer stated that the first hour with the game would be amusing, but due to the lack of more expansive features, he \\"[does not] recommend it to anyone looking for more than disposable entertainment\\". Steve Tilley of the Toronto Sun described the game as one where \\"most players will have a few hours of fun and then file [it] away as an occasional novelty to pull out when they‚Äôre especially bored\\". Rich Stanton of The Guardian was very critical of Goat Simulator, noting how the title is self-aware of its poor quality, and stated that the game's creation and promotion \\"demonstrates how social media and the internet amplify our supine tendencies\\". Andy Kelly of PC Gamer was also critical of the title, calling it a \\"bad, amateurish and boring game\\", and considered its popularity was only due to word-of-mouth and YouTube videos that enticed players to buy the game themselves. While critical reviews were mixed, the game proved popular with players. The game's alpha footage, as well as Let's Play videos on pre-release copies such as that from PewDiePie, drew a great deal of demand for the game prior to release. Ibrisagic stated that Coffee Stain Studios made their money back on the development costs within a few minutes of the game being offered on Steam. As of August 2014, the studio has reported that nearly a million copies of Goat Simulator have been sold, outperforming their other games over the previous four years. The mobile release for iOS and Android systems reached 100,000 downloads within 6 days of launch. By mid-January 2015, over 2.5 million copies of the game were sold across all platforms. During a presentation at the 2016 Game Developers Conference, Ibrisagic revealed that Goat Simulator has made more than $12 million in revenue, compared to both Sanctum and Sanctum 2 which made under $2 million each. Goat Simulator was seen as a disruptive title in contrast to typical AAA titles; Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester felt they needed to publish more games like Goat Simulator, stating \\"You have to have an edge in there, and that's why I say 'more Goat Simulator and less Call of Duty for Paradox, because we need the edge. It's easier to get out and market, it's easier to show what you're doing\\" adding that \\"People are tired of explosions and dubstep music. We've seen it a million times now\\". With the success of the game, Coffee Stain Studios has worked to license out Goat Simulator-themed properties with third- party vendors. It also enabled the studio to become a video game publisher for smaller studios in 2017. Several games have followed in trying to capture the same goofy style of gameplay with unpredictable physics engines as Goat Simulator, including Bear Simulator and I Am Bread. Goat Simulator as well as 2013's Surgeon Simulator are often considered the first examples of \\"YouTube bait\\" games, purposely designed to appeal to an audience watching the game being played but lacking any redeeming gameplay values.

Thousands of Lithuanians immigrated to Baltimore between the 1880s and 1920s. The Lithuanian American community was mainly centered in what is now the Hollins‚ÄìRoundhouse Historic District. Baltimore's Lithuanian community has founded several institutions to preserve the Lithuanian heritage of the city, including a Roman Catholic parish, a cultural festival, a dance hall, and a yeshiva. Demographics Shaarei Tfiloh Synagogue, March 2012. In 1920, 2,554 foreign-born White people in Baltimore spoke either the Lithuanian language or the Latvian language. In 1940, 2,839 immigrants from Lithuania lived in Baltimore. These immigrants comprised 4.7% of the city's foreign-born white population. In the 1960 United States Census, Lithuanian-Americans comprised 44% of the foreign-born population in South Baltimore's tract 22‚Äì2. By 1991, there were an estimated 20,000 Lithuanians living in the Baltimore area. The Lithuanian community in the Baltimore metropolitan area numbered 11,024 as of 2000, making up 0.4% of the area's population. In the same year Baltimore city's Lithuanian population was 1,519, 0.2% of the city's population. In 2013, an estimated 1,092 Lithuanian-Americans resided in Baltimore city, 0.2% of the population. As of September 2014, immigrants from Lithuania were the 102nd largest foreign-born population in Baltimore. History St. Alphonsus Church, Rectory, Convent and Halle, March 2012. Lithuanians began to settle in Baltimore in 1876. The wave increased greatly during the 1880s and continued in large numbers until the 1920s. By 1950, the Lithuanian community numbered around 9,000. These Lithuanians settled primarily in a neighborhood north of Hollins Street that became known as Baltimore's Little Lithuania. In 1889, Jonas ≈†li≈´pas founded the Lithuanian Scientific Society in Baltimore. It promoted Lithuanian language and culture and was active until 1896. Three Roman Catholic churches have been designated as Lithuanian parishes: St. Alphonsus' beginning in 1917, St. John the Baptist Church from 1888 to 1917, and St. Wenceslaus beginning in 1872. St. Alphonsus' is the only remaining Lithuanian parish in Baltimore, as St. Wenceslaus was re-designated as a Bohemian parish and St. John the Baptist Church closed in 1989. While most Lithuanians who settled in Baltimore were Roman Catholic, a large minority were Lithuanian Jews. Between the 1880s and the 1920s, Lithuanian Jews (also known as Litvaks) were a major component of Jewish immigration to Baltimore. The Yeshivas Ner Yisroel, a prominent yeshiva in Baltimore, was founded as a Lithuanian (Litvish)-style Talmudic college by Jews from Lithuania and Belarus. Litvaks also helped found the B'nai Israel Synagogue. Little Lithuania Baltimore's former Little Lithuania, Hollins-Roundhouse Historic District, March 2012. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the Hollins-Roundhouse neighborhood became established as the center of Baltimore's Lithuanian immigrant community. Because of the large Lithuanian population in the area north of Hollins Street, the area became known as Little Lithuania. A few remnants of the neighborhood's Lithuanian heritage still remain, such as Lithuanian Hall located on Hollins Street. Culture Lithuanian Hall, Hollins-Roundhouse Historic District, February 2018. While other immigrant ethnic groups in Baltimore founded numerous ethnic building and loan associations between the 1860s and the 1910s, Lithuanians only founded one. This is because many Lithuanians shared the associations of other ethnic groups, especially those of the Polish. An annual Lithuanian Festival is held in Catonsville in Baltimore County, not far outside city limits. The festival features Lithuanian food and drink, dances, and ethnic items.

The song's lyrics tell of a young man who is \\"tired of dreaming\\" and yearns to fly \\"free like a bird that escaped its prison.\\" A hit in Spain, the song also became popular in much of Spanish-speaking Latin America, where it took on political overtones. Banned in Cuba, in Chile it was adopted as an unofficial anti-communist anthem and became popular among supporters of the military junta.

It has crowded, yellowish green pseudobulbs, dark green leaves and two or three cream-coloured to whitish or greenish flowers which often do not open fully. It grows on trees and rocks on one mountain on Norfolk Island. Description Dendrobium brachypus is an epiphytic or lithophytic orchid with crowded, yellowish green pseudobulbs long and wide. Each pseudobulb has between two and four dark green, egg-shaped to elliptic leaves long and wide. The flowering stems are long and bear two or three cream-coloured to whitish or greenish flowers with thick ovaries. The flowers are long and wide, self-pollinating and usually do not open widely. The sepals are about long and wide, the petals a similar length but only about half as wide. The labellum is about long and wide and is unlobed. Flowering occurs between August and October.Orchard, A.E. (ed.) (1994). Oceanic Islands 1. Flora of Australia 49: 1-681. Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra. Taxonomy and naming The Norfolk Island orchid was first formally described in 1833 by Stephan Endlicher who gave it the name Thelychiton brachypus and published the description in Prodromus Florae Norfolkicae. In 1877 Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach changed the name to Dendrobium brachypus. The specific epithet (brachypus) is derived from ancient Greek words meaning \\"short\\" and \\"foot\\", alluding to the relatively short pseudobulbs of this orchid, in contrast to those of Dendrobium macropus, described by Endlicher in the same publication.Orchard, A.E. (ed.) (1994). Oceanic Islands 1. Flora of Australia 49: 1-681. Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra. Distribution and habitat Dendrobium brachypus is endemic to the Australian external territory of Norfolk Island in the Tasman Sea, where it grows on rocks and trees in forest on the slopes of Mount Pitt. Conservation This orchid is rare and listed as endangered under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).

Early life Born in Kentucky in 1810, Wallace was homeschooled by his mother and moved to Missouri when he was 16, marrying Marcie Lewis when he was 18, and having two children, Sarah and Thomas. In the 1840s, when the United States went to war with Mexico, Wallace struggled to pay his debts on the small farm his family ran. He did not send his children to school. Local government officials in his area met with him in June 1846 in which he was ordered to either join the US military or go to jail for failing to pay his taxes. He agreed to join the military. When it was discovered he was breaking the law, by not sending his children to school, they were taken away from him. Wallace became insane after this experience and grew to hate the US. He was enlisted in the Missouri volunteers and sent to Mexico. Shortly after arriving he received word his wife had committed suicide over the loss of their children, which completely unhinged him. Defection to the Mexican side In September his regiment fought at the Battle of Monterrey. During the battle Wallace killed several US soldiers and defected to the Mexican side. Wallace had been taught Spanish by his mother and he joined the forces of Mexican guerrilla leader Pancho Juana. Juana and Wallace were defeated by US soldiers at the battle of Los Zanetios. Juana died of alcohol poisoning shortly after and Wallace formed his own guerrilla force, known as Raiders matar estadounidenses (Spanish for American killing raiders) Wallace's men attacked the pro American Mexican town of Quito, killing over 200 Mexican civilians. In February 1847 Wallace attacked an American wagon train at Gonzales and killed 30 US soldiers. Afterwards his men killed 200 dragoons, scalping and mutilating the bodies, decorating body parts to their saddles. He then rode to the camp of General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna at the Battle of Buena Vista, and participated in battle there. Next his men fought at the Battle of the Sacramento River and killed 30 Texas rangers in an attack on their camp. He murdered over 150 American soldiers and civilians after attacking a supply column. In March his guerrillas raided into New Mexico, supporting the Taos Revolt, and fighting Apache Indians. During the New Mexico raids his men killed an American general. He wanted to raid into California and Texas but US forces drove him back into Mexico. He suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Columbia over which half his men and commanders were killed. He fought at the Battle of Cerro Gordo on April 18, 1847, and 2 days later his band was attacked by American forces in which he was fatally shot in the head and all of his men killed or captured. His head was cut off and he was scalped, and his body tossed along the road. US forces displayed his head after capturing Mexico City. Wallace was known for horrific brutality, raping women, cutting off the genitals of children, and scalping, skinning, dismembering, castrating, disemboweling, beheading, and other mutilations on US soldiers. He became known as the \\"White Apache Tiger\\" and \\"Bloody Jacob\\". He has some direct living descendants. The Mexican government never recognized him as a Mexican citizen or regular soldier.

The brand first gained attention in the running industry by producing shoes with oversized outsoles, dubbed \\"maximalist\\" shoes due to extra cushion; this was in contrast to the minimalist shoes trend that was gaining popularity at the time of the company's founding in 2009. Hoka produces both low-profile and max-cushion shoes for road, trail, and all-terrain; throughout its product line, Hoka shoes retain features like a low weight-to-cushion ratio and midsole and outsole geometry designed to promote inherent stability and an efficient stride. The company was founded in 2009 in Annecy, France; it has been based in Richmond, California and its corporate headquarters are currently in Goleta, California. The company operates as subsidiary of Deckers Brands. The Brand President is Wendy Yang, who serves as President of the Deckers Performance Lifestyle Group, which includes the brands Teva and Sanuk. History Hoka One One Tennine The company was founded by Nicolas Mermoud and Jean-Luc Diard, former Salomon employees, in 2009, when they sought to design a shoe that allowed them to run downhill faster, and created a model with an oversized outsole that had more cushion than other running shoes at the time. The shoes are named after the Maori language phrase loosely meaning \\"fly over the earth\\". The shoes were initially embraced by ultramarathon runners due to their enhanced cushion and inherent stability; however, they quickly gained popularity among other runners for offering maximum cushion and minimal weight. The brand's original, highest-cushion models are now accompanied in the HOKA lineup by lighter-weight shoes that retain much of the brand's signature cushion, and even lightweight training and racing shoes and track spikes. HOKA was purchased on April 1, 2013 by Deckers Brands, the parent company for UGG, Teva and other footwear brands The company sponsors a variety of professional runners; its first athletes were primarily trail-ultra runners, but their roster has expanded to include several track & field, triathlon, and road-running athletes. HOKA also has long-term sponsorship deals with the professional training groups Northern Arizona Elite, based in Flagstaff, Arizona; the New Jersey New York Track Club; and the California- based Aggies Running Club.

Early life and education Justice Benavides was born in Laredo, Texas, and grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas. She is a 1981 graduate of Mary Carroll High School. Upon graduation, Benavides attended the University of Texas at Austin, where she graduated in 1985 with a bachelor's degree in business administration. After receiving her undergraduate degree, Benavides enrolled at the University of Houston Law Center. During law school, Benavides was active in the Hispanic Law Students Association and the civil practice clinic. Benavides obtained her law degree and law license in 1988.  Private practice  Before joining the Thirteenth Court of Appeals, Justice Benavides was a litigator with over 17 years of courtroom experience. She began her legal career at the Adams & Graham Law Firm in Harlingen, Texas, in 1988. At this primarily defense firm, she tried over 30 cases throughout the state of Texas in the areas of toxic tort, products liability, commercial litigation, and personal injury. After 12 years, she joined the law firm of Gonzalez & Associates, P.C. in McAllen, Texas where she continued to litigate but as a plaintiffs' lawyer. She also began an active appellate practice at this time. As a private attorney, Justice Benavides was recognized in Texas Monthly as a Super Lawyer in 2003 and 2004 by her peers as one of the best lawyers in the state of Texas. She also served as a minority director for the State Bar of Texas. She was president of the Mexican-American Bar Association of Texas and the Cameron County Bar Association, as well as a vice-president of the Texas Association of Defense Counsel. Her service also includes stints on numerous committees for the State Bar of Texas, including Continuing Legal Education and Law Focused Education.

Prior to her re-election, she was endorsed by the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.

In 2008, she was appointed to serve on the Texas Center for the Judiciary Board of Directors (the \\"Texas Center\\").

In 2010, the Texas Supreme Court appointed Justice Benavides to the Texas Access to Justice Commission. This commission was created by the Supreme Court of Texas in 2001 to develop and implement initiatives to expand access to, and enhance the quality of, justice in civil matters for low-income Texans. In February 2012, the State Bar of Texas through President Bob Black appointed a new task force dubbed \\"Solutions 2012\\" to deal with decreasing funding for legal access and rising numbers of unrepresented (pro se) litigants, and the implications of these developments for the Texas legal system.

On February 12, 2014, the State Bar of Texas released the results of its 2014 Judicial Poll. Justice Benavides received the most votes in the supreme court race for Place 7 race with 4,039 votes. Additionally, she was the only non- incumbent candidate for the Texas Supreme Court to receive the most votes for each place on the ballot.

Vedic interpretation The single principle behind the universe is described by Atharvaveda in Mantra X.8.11 in the following words: :‡§Ø‡§¶‡•á‡§ú‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡§§‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ø‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö ‡§§‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§¶‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ø‡§∑‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö ‡§Ø‡§¶‡•ç ‡§≠‡•Å‡§µ‡§§‡•ç  :‡§§‡§¶‡•ç ‡§¶‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§™‡•É‡§•‡§ø‡§µ‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡§Ç ‡§§‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏‡§Ç ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Ø ‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§ï‡§Æ‡•á‡§µ  as the one reality existing which possessing multifarious forms and qualities upholds this world that has resting on it whatever which desires to move or fly or stay stationary which breathes or does not breath, which sees and does not see. According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, the word,Sthiti, refers to maintenance, of the created world, the life-giver, duration of life of the maintenance of universal creation, and according to Sri Brahma Samhita, it refers to preservation. Jaina interpretation In Jainism, the word, Sthiti, refers to the length or duration (in time) of ayu-karma, the specific period for which the karmic matter, consisting of desires or passions that motivate actions remains, bound with the soul, the specific length of life in the gati whether as heavenly being or hell being is determined by the sthiti of ayu that stays bound; bhava-leshya affects sthiti and pradesa-bandha. The duration of karmans of a Jiva is dependent on adhayavasaya ('the tenure of the mind'), and therefore, on the strength of the kasayas ('binding factors'). Buddhist interpretation Abhidharma-kosa, a Buddhist text, in Sloka II.46 tells us that ‚Äì \\"Arising is existence following upon non-existence; duration is the series; impermanence is the rupture of all series; and between the successive states of the series\\"; in Buddhism sthiti refers to the impermanence of duration; it is the impermanence of duration that destroys dharma The Sarvastivadins, as a result of the analysis of change, commute impermanence in terms of jati ('nascent'), sthiti ('static'), jara ('decaying') and nasa ('cessant') moments taking \\"change of what exists\\" as signifying two moments, static and decaying. The followers of Theravada reject the jara-moment, and the Sautrantikas reject the sthiti-moment. Yoga school‚Äôs interpretation The Vastu-sutra Upanishad with reference to Kriyavastha ('rituals of postural action') speaks of six essential disciplines that can be applied to Asana; the language of postures refers to three rhythms ‚Äì Shrishti ('emanation'), Sthiti ('maintenance') and Samhara ('resorption'). Vaijayanti Kosha defines Sthiti as the act of maintaining. Sthiti relates to adulthood and emphasizes organic and pranic actions. As per Yoga terminology, the word, Sthiti, means 'steadiness' i.e. steadiness of the mind ‚Äì :‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡•å ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ω‡§≠‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∏‡§É  :\\"Of these two, abhyƒÅs, practice, is the effort to develop steadiness\\" - (Yoga Sutra 13) Samadhi is the highest Sthiti of mind. Yoga school recommends exercises to be practiced in accordance with one‚Äôs physical condition, age and constitution; the general rule is to follow vriddhi (during youth when the body is healthy and growing), sthiti (during middle age when the body is neither growing nor decaying) and laya (during old age when the body gets old and is decaying). The different asana ('postures'), which are duly graded, are also called sthiti. Moreover, absence of commonly experienced states of mental distraction known as citta vritti is called sthiti ('stationary') or absolute tranquility, in that state one experiences prasanta-vahita ('flow of peace'); and in which state the yogi desires to remain continuously. According to Yoga Rahasya, Sthiti is a karma meant for the house-holder, and Sthiti means ‚Äì to stay i.e. the priority to maintain health rather than increase strength. Vaishnava interpretation According to Vaishnava Dharma, the five functions of Shakti are triodhana or triobhava ('delusion'), shrishti ('creation'), sthiti ('sustenance'), laya or samhrti ('dissolution') and anugraha ('grace'); these account for its Kiryashakti ('power of action'). Avyakta, aksara, yoni, avidya, trigunas, sthiti, maya, svabhava etc., are synonyms of Prakrti. Yoga Vasistha has six prakarnas ('divisions') ‚Äì vairagya ('renunciation'), mumuksu-vyavahara ('longing for salvation'), utpatti ('cosmological origin'), sthiti ('preservation'), upasama ('quiescence') and nirvana ('absorption'). The five stories in Sthiti Prakarna narrated by Rishi Vashistha, show that by forgetting that the actor, the perceiver, the knower or \\"I\\" is one's own creation identifying with action, and by identifying with the actor, the perceived and the known, one becomes totally bound and suffers repeated births. Sthiti or preservation of the \\"I\\" is important for growth when one learns and experiences the different aspects of existence. Shaivite interpretation The five activities attributed to Ishvara by the Shaivites are ‚Äì shrishti ('emanation or projection'), sthiti ('maintenance'), samhara ('withdrawal'), vilaya ('concealment of the real nature') and anugraha ('grace'), and therefore, Shiva is known as pancakrityakari, the continuous do-er of five-fold act which is different from the concept of Brahman who is niskriya ('without activity'). Pratayabhijna insists on meditation on panca-krtya and the practice of vikalpa-ksaya during which course the retention and enjoyment of what one perceives (abhasana) is rakti or sthiti i.e. preservation, which is withdrawn at the time of knowledge. Sthiti is thus the inward cessation of all darsanas ('empirical knowledge, the experience of things'). The Devi-Bhagavata III.7.25-26 speaks of the three shaktis of the three gunas ‚Äì jnana-shakti of sattva, kriya-shakti of rajas and artha-shakti or dravya-shakti of tamas; jnana and dravya show the nature of prakasa ('light', 'knowledge') and sthiti ('sustenance', 'existence') in a clearer way. Shrishti (natural state and Nature), Sthiti (continuation and maintenance) and Samhara (annihilation and reabsorption) constitute the triad which alludes to a ceaseless process of creation, sustenance and dissolution in a repeating cycle starting from the emptiness of a positive content which causes multifarious forms to shine forth in the mid- way of its movement before receding to rest from where the process started. Sthiti is defined as that by virtue of which the gunas are recognized as gunas, and is the common name of the other two genders viz. birth and death.

It was created by Jean Louis-Vandestoc and written by Madellaine Paxson. It first aired in France on 18 October 2014 on France 3, and has expanded to television channels in Europe. It was also streamed on Netflix. As of 2020, there is no announcement regarding a third season.  Plot  Iris is a teenage girl who likes to sing and help others. However, when she sings, strange events happen. Encouraged by her best friend Nathaniel, Iris auditions for a girl rock band, but ends up destroying the room and is later attacked by two strangers. The judges at the audition, Talia and Auriana, come to help her, and they explain to her that she is actually a princess with magical powers who must save her kingdom of Ephedia from the clutches of Gramorr, who has taken it over. The only way to save it is to master her powers and to find the Oracle Gems of the Royal Crown of Ephedia, which have been scattered across the Earth. Over the course of the series, the three girls try to live as both ordinary teenagers as well as rock stars of the all-female band \\"LoliRock\\", while training Iris in secret and gathering the gems. But when Gramorr sends twin siblings Praxina and Mephisto to fight them and summon monsters to cause chaos, the girls must work together as magical girl warrior princesses. In season 2, the three girls are joined by Ephedian girls Carissa and Lyna, who also transform into warrior princesses, but are not part of the band. The girls continue gathering Oracle Gems while helping those in need, but Gramorr and the evil twins continue to get stronger as well. When the last oracle gem is collected, Iris faces the reality of having to say goodbye to Nathaniel and returning to Ephedia, but when Gramorr claims the final gem and is freed, the girls work together to face him in one last battle. Episodes Characters  Tabitha St. Germain voiced several of the key characters in LoliRock including Auriana, Amaru, Aunt Ellen, and Carissa * (voiced by Kazumi Evans in English version, Lisa Caruso in French version) ‚Äì The lead singer of LoliRock, Iris is a 15-year-old girl living in Sunny Bay; she has wavy blonde hair, fair skin, light blue eyes, pink lips and freckles. She is kind-hearted and willing to help everyone. She has a singing power that seems to enchant everything around her; this power is coveted by Gramorr. She has a crush on her childhood best friend, Nathaniel. After she meets Talia and Auriana, she discovers that she is the crown princess of Ephedia, a magical kingdom, and her duty is to find all the Oracle Gems of the Royal Crown and to reclaim the throne of Ephedia. When she transforms using a pendant, her hair turns rose pink and her clothes turn pink, and she has a heart symbol and a four-pointed star symbol. The production Tumblr said that she gets two symbols because she is in the royal family which rules the realm and the entire planet. Character designer Bertrand Todesco initially considered Iris as having dark hair that would change to blonde in the transformation, but found that to be a clich√©, and instead went with pop and girly colours like Katy Perry. Iris was based on actress Taylor Momsen from Gossip Girl, and the wardrobe was based on a picture of Blake Lively, also from Gossip Girl, in a green dress. He also cited British singer Pixie Lott as a reference. * (voiced by Ashleigh Ball in English version, Kelly Marot in French version) ‚Äì She sings vocals and plays the keytar and sometimes guitar in LoliRock. She has long dark brown hair with straight bangs, dark skin, and amber eyes. She is serious, kind, and very intelligent. As the second princess of Xeris, she was imprisoned by Gramorr before going on the search for the princess of Ephedia with the help of Auriana. Her transformation item is a bracelet; her hair turns light blue and her clothes become blue. Her symbol is the diamond. Taila's character reference was French fashion blogger Betty Autier and her wardrobe, Amber Stevens West as she portrayed Ashleigh Owens in the TV series Greek, and singers Keri Hilson and Alicia Keys. * (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain in English version, L√©opoldine Serre in French version) ‚Äì She sings vocals and plays tambourine in LoliRock. She has waist-length auburn hair styled in a ponytail, tan skin, and green eyes. She is bubbly, playful, boy-crazy, and a bit air-headed, but a reliable friend. She is the princess of Volta. Her transformation item is a ring; her hair and clothes turn bright orange, and she sports a longer ponytail. Her symbol is a crescent moon. Todesco wrote that Auriana's original name was Aurora and that he had pictured her as a black girl with a huge volume of hair, and that Talia would be maybe Asian with long straight hair, but he later changed the hairstyles. He wrote that Auriana was \\"all the other cool things I like and I couldn't put on Iris and/or Talia.\\" Auriana's character reference was Leighton Meester from Gossip Girl and Cat Valentine (played by Ariana Grande) from the teen sitcom Victorious. He said that the name choice was a coincidence. * (vocalisations by Tabitha St. Germain) ‚Äì A purple and white furry creature with dark blue hair and a fluffy little tail. He has the ability to transform into a winged horse and to transport the princesses and their enemies to a special arena to allow the princesses to fight evil away from any civilians. Todesco created Amaru out of the magical girl concept of having pets such as with Sailor Moon having a cat, and that Amaru would be able to transform into a keyring plush on her bag. * (voiced by Mackenzie Gray in English version, Gilles Morvan in French version) ‚Äì The Grand Wizard of Chaos. He has blond hair and purple eyes, wears a crown as well as a mask that covers his nose and mouth. After betraying the king and queen, Gramorr has taken control of Ephedia. However, to gain total control of the kingdom, he must have the royal crown, which is protected by a spell. He is thus unable to leave the castle area and must rely on Praxina and Mephisto to do his work. He has a black panther minion named Banes, which is described by the production Tumblr as the anti-Amaru, and was created to give Gramorr more presence. In early promotions for the series, Gramorr was named Gromar and he was depicted as Iris's evil uncle who imprisoned the king and queen, and had sent his two evil twin nephews to Earth to thwart Lolirock and take the gems, but the idea was scrapped as it would have made him more of a stereotype. * (voiced by Kelly Sheridan in English version, Karine Foviau in French version) ‚Äì She has long burgundy-colored hair that typically covers one of her eyes. She loves to belittle people, especially her enemies and her twin brother, the latter of whom she reminds that she was born before. She has a very affirmed personality and often bosses her brother around. Her theme colour is red. Her attacks tend to be demonstrations of raw power with explosions and large summoned monsters. In early concepts of the series, they were considered the two evil twin nephews of Gramorr. Todesco started the design for Praxina and Mephisto on Halloween day of 2011. Todesco originally designed Praxina dressed in black-and-white with a x symbol in her eyes. Todesco's character designer partner Benedicte Claravino went with a night butterfly/moth concept, with a bun hairstyle that extended to long twin tails. Her eyes would be butterflies instead of x's, of which the butterfly brooch stayed with around. Her design was originally approved, but then the producers thought she was too \\"Japanese\\" and scary, so he and Benedicte redrew her and came out with a more suitable design. The production Tumblr describes Praxina as an \\"anti-Iris\\", so she was given two symbols: lightning for her magic, and butterfly for herself. * (voiced by Vincent Tong in English version, Nessym Guetat in French version) ‚Äì He and his twin sister Praxina are sent to Earth by Gramorr to prevent the princesses from thwarting his master's plans at any price. He has short burgundy-coloured hair. He enjoys destroying things, but sometimes acts cheesy, incompetent, and has a short attention span. His theme colour is green. Of the two, Mephisto prefers elaborate spells and tricks and bragging about how he's a genius. He originally had a black-and-white motif along with + symbols in his eyes. Like Praxina, he had a butterfly concept but it was rejected. Director Jean-Louis Vandestoc then suggested a snake symbol and a half-hidden face. Mephisto's design was eventually approved without the hidden face part. * (voiced by Matt Ellis in English version, Hugo Brunswick in French version) ‚Äì Iris's childhood best friend. He has short cocoa brown spiky hair. He knows Iris at heart, and often encourages her with kindness and a little humor. He and Iris harbour crushes on each other. Nathaniel works at the smoothie shop the girls frequent. In early promotions for the series back in 2013, Senior VP Patricia de Wilde said Nathaniel was Iris's boyfriend and the only outsider that would know of the band's secret. * (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain in English version, named Tante Ellen and voiced by Magali Rosenzweig in French version) ‚Äì Iris's adoptive guardian, she has taken care of her since she was a baby. She is a cheerful lady who likes to take care of her garden. In the start of the series, she takes in Talia and Auriana as exchange students. In the season 2 episode \\"Truth Be Told\\", it is revealed that her real name is Ellira, an Ephedian bodyguard to Iris's parents who is tasked with raising Iris and protecting her on Earth. * (voiced by James Kirk in English version, Julien Crumpon in French version) ‚Äì He has blond hair and typically wears a brown hat with a pink band. He debuts in Episode 13, \\"Batty\\". He is LoliRock's number- one fan and writes a blog about them, gushing over different things and happenings about them. Doug can be gullible sometimes due to his innocence. * (voiced by Ashleigh Ball in English version, named Suzy Robins and voiced by Audrey Sable in French version) ‚Äì Iris's childhood rival who debuts in episode 2 \\"Flower Power\\". She greyish-black hair and yellow-green eyes. As the daughter of the mayor of Sunny Bay, she acts spoiled and vain. When asked whether Missy was based on rival character Mandy in Totally Spies!, the production Tumblr wrote that Missy was not based on her, even though she looks like her. They wanted a character that would be a love rival and a pest, and went with a brunette hair colour to contrast Iris being a blonde, calling it a \\"classic trope\\". * (voiced by Chiara Zanni in English version, Jessica Monceau in French version) ‚Äì Talia's older sister from Xeris. She possesses a great power, and is deemed to be a powerful, responsible and intelligent princess. Talia lost track of her since the attack of Gramorr on Xeris. It is later revealed that she was imprisoned in the prison fortress Krozak on Ephedia. In the show, she first appears in \\"Xeris\\". She has white hair, dark skin, and mulberry blue eyes. She returns in the season 1 finale episode \\"Home\\", where she leads a resistance movement against Gramorr. In the production Tumblr, she is nine years older than Talia, and her design was based mainly on imagining what Talia would look like in the future. To distinguish herself from Talia, she was designed with slightly darker skin tone and lighter hair. Her symbol is three diamonds. * (voiced by Sam Vincent in English version, Yoann Bellot Sover in French version) ‚Äì An Ephedian thief who initially appears as a fellow prisoner of Gramorr in the season 1 finale episodes and goes with Iris when they try to escape from their cells. However, it is soon revealed that he has been working for Gramorr all along (as he was the highest bidder) to get her to release the crown. His magic crest bears the symbol of an eagle. * (voiced by Kelly Sheridan in English version, Marie Nonnenmacher in French version) ‚Äì A princess of Borealis, she debuts in \\"Home Part I\\". In her magical princess state, she has light green hair. She is shy, but brave, light-hearted, and sophisticated. She loves crystal tea and is proud that her castle had won awards for most beautiful. She and Carissa helped free Izira from Gramorr and joined her resistance movement. Her transformation item is a hair pin, and her symbol is a fleur-de-lys. Her weapon is a chakram (ring), but she prefers to use levitation in her spells. At the end of the first season, she joins the LoliRock girls on Earth where she has long straight black hair, medium skin, and violet eyes. As with Carissa, she is neither part of the band nor lives with them at Aunt Ellen's, but appears in some of the episodes. Her transformation sequence is inspired by Sailor Moon, specifically Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, and they are shorter transformations than the main three girls for production reasons and because it would have been boring. According to the character designers, Lyna was depicted as snooty and delicate. Her colour theme is teal. During the development of Carissa and Lyna's characters, the designers wanted to make one of them styled like an Asian princess, and settled with Lyna, while the Caucasian version of Lyna was used for a guest character Debra in season 2. * (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain in English version, Fanny Bloc in French version) ‚Äì A princess of Calix, she also debuts in \\"Home Part I\\". In her magical princess state, she has purple hair, and purple is also her general theme colour. She likes to show off her fighting skills, enjoys having bruises, and is fired up whenever she's fighting. After she and Lyna free Izira, she joins the latter's resistance movement. Her transformation item is an armlet and her symbol is a compass rose. Her weapon is a pair of clubs, and she prefers close-quarters combat. At the end of the first season, she joins the LoliRock girls on Earth, where she has red-orange hair styled in a fishtail braid, light skin and blue eyes. Storyboarder Christelle Abgrall wrote that Carissa's transformation was inspired by Sailor Uranus and her main attack. The characters designers depicted Carissa as a fiery tomboy. Carissa's hair was made brown in some of the early depictions so as to not confuse her with the redhead Auriana, but the designers later went with her original Irish redhead hair colour. Some of the drafts had also depicted her with dark skin or styled like an Asian princess. Production=Conception Jean-Louis Vandestoc drew inspiration for LoliRock from watching anime in his childhood that was broadcast on the French channels, including Sherlock Hound, Space Adventure Cobra, The Mysterious Cities of Gold and Dragon Ball, but his most influential title he watched was Magical Princess Minky Momo. He wrote \\"I loved the very core of it: a child transforming into an adult, helping people and making good deeds, the nice chara design, and finally the tone of the show: it could be funny and light, but also dramatic and tearful at other times. My soul was marked forever.\\" After working on French cartoons Monster Buster Club and Rekkit Rabbit he wanted to make a magical girl show. He chose Sailor Moon and Pretty Cure as references for the magical girl part, and Jem and the Holograms for the music career part. Character design The producers at Marathon Media asked designers to draw Iris for a magical girl project as a teenage alien princess with ice/crystal powers. Character designer Bertrand Todesco drew inspiration from Betty Autier, a French fashion blogger of \\"le blog de betty\\". She had dark hair and straight bangs, but Todesco figured the producers wanted a blonde girl for a lead, so he went with the look of Jenny Humphrey of the TV series Gossip Girl, portrayed by Taylor Momsen. The producers also wanted the girls' irises to be star-shaped. Autier's appearance as well as her wardrobe was retained for Talia. Following the initial picture, Todesco needed to design a princess/rockstar outfit, of which he chose a green dress worn by Blake Lively. The colour was changed to pink as green was not suitable for merchandising. Todeco added a magical pet creature in the custom of Sailor Moon, which would later become Amaru. He designed in the hair streaks for when the girls were rock stars, and dresses that weren't so frilly that they would be complicated to draw. In designing Talia and the then-named Aurora, Todesco originally started with a black girl and an Asian girl with typical hairstyles, but later changed his mind. He then found inspirations from other Gossip Girl characters as well as actresses Amber Stevens West and Ariana Grande, the latter of whom was how she acted in the teen sitcom Victorious rather than her current pop singer image. He also referenced Keri Hilson and Alicia Keys. Victorious was also the inspiration for some of the key visuals he used in promoting the series to get funding. Early promotions of the series pictured the antagonist named Gromar to be an evil uncle of Iris who imprisoned the king and queen, and that he sent his two evil twin nephews to Earth to thwart Lolirock and take the gems. Paxson said that they abandoned the idea as it would have made him more of a stereotype. Todesco originally conceived of antagonists Praxina and Mephisto to have guitar playing sound powers that would counter the girls' singing voice powers but the idea was abandoned. After several iterations, Praxina's final design was approved where she would have a butterfly brooch and motif, while Mephisto's was approved later, after director Jean-Louis had suggested he have a snake motif and a half-covered face. Eventually Gramorr would have the covered face, The design for the crystal magic circles and related animation was first done in 2D based on some reference pictures. Different colours and symbols were assigned to each character. It was later created in CGI. Animation tools used include Toon Boom Harmony, Adobe After Effects, and Blender. Lyna and Carissa were created in response to a request from the producers when the writing for season 1 was nearing completion. The request was to add two new princesses to increase the member count to five. However, the LoliRock developers thought they already had too many characters so they made Lyna and Carissa supporting characters that were \\"outside the main gang but always ready and willing to help when needed\\". The two girls' transformations resemble Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune. The designers considered making one of the two girls look Asian to balance out the overall group's look; they applied the look to both girls, and chose Lyna. There was also a concern that Carissa might be confused with Auriana as the show's redhead, they decided to go with giving her an Irish redhead theme anyway. Themes and writing LoliRock head writer Madellaine Paxson, who had worked on children's shows Making Fiends, Power Rangers RPM as well as the horror film Blood Punch, described the themes of the show as: friendship and love, magic, singing / music, and good vs. evil. She said the hardest part in writing an episode is the beginning and also in integrating the themes along with a story with a person that needs help. Her favourite scenes from the show were where the princesses are together doing ordinary teenage girl things as they had opportunities for comedy. She summarised the show as having something for everybody, very girly, but good action too. In the press release, Zodiak Kids describe the show as having a \\"cast of characters that are aspirational role models for a generation of children for whom justice has become a core value\\". Jean-Louis Vandestoc chose a band concept for the series as it was different from his other shows which involved characters that went to school and then saved the world. The school part was replaced by the girls training or rehearsing for the concert. The developers later commented in their production blog FAQ that Iris was still attending school and that the episodes aren't all during summer vacation. According to posts on the production Tumblr, LoliRock is classified as somewhere between a script-driven and storyboard-driven show. They started with a full script and then recorded lines with scratch voices or final voices, as re-recording after storyboarding would be costlier. The storyboard is then worked on, and some of the storyboard artists and supervisor adding and changing things they felt were important such as with the kiss scene in the Shanila episode and the Iris becoming a dark princess. Storyboard stage also included fixes for continuity and plot holes. Music and voice-over The music score was composed and produced by Norbert \\"Yellowshark\\" Gilbert, with about 600 tracks over the course of the 52 26-minute episodes. Five recurring songs (including the theme song) were recorded for each season. Due to limited resources in production, the team posted that Iris would be the only one singing on those songs, so they recorded Yasmin Shah in English and then developed the music videos. After realising that it would be unnatural for the other girls to not sing, they designed Iris to have a microphone while the others would just sing along. They considered recording singing for Talia and Auriana but were constrained by budget. Cassandre Berger provided the singing on the French dub. The voices were then mixed. As the dialogue was done later, the voice actors only sang on the incidental bits such as rehearsals. The episodes were written and dubbed in English first and then adapted into French. For season 1, the English voices were recorded at Vida Spark Productions in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, while the French voices were recorded at Lylo studios in Paris, France. Marketing and promotion Zodiak Media announced LoliRock in April 2013 at the MIPTV event in Cannes, France. Early promotions included the idea of princesses with magical singing voices. The demographic target audience is girls ages 6 to 12, and the group has partnered with France Televisions and Disney Channel France. Marathon Media CEO Vincent Chalvron- Demersay and general manager David Michel said that \\"LoliRock is a fresh, contemporary take on what it is to be a girl today, infused with music and magical adventures and the all-important notion of justice in today's teenage world. It's a perfect companion piece to Totally Spies!, which has been so successful in this same space.\\" In comparing the promotion of the show to that of Totally Spies!, Zodiak senior vice-president Patricia de Wilde said that Zodiak made sure the premise was made clear for the new show. The five songs were publicised as music videos on YouTube. Plans were also made to create live-action LoliRock bands in various markets, such as Super TV's contest held online and among major cities in Italy. A website was launched with videos, games, and message boards. Promotional toys were also offered at Quick restaurants as well as McDonald's.References to Quick restaurant: * Bertrand Todesco announces Quick toys: * Dutch version of website showing LoliRock promotion: * French version of website showing LoliRock promotion: An app was developed for the music which Zodiak senior vice-president Patricia de Wilde said was a \\"sort of cross between K-Pop and Katy Perry.\\"  Broadcast  The show premiered on France 3 on 18 October 2014. running for 13 episodes until March 2015. On 26 January 2016, Zodiak Kids published an article officially announcing that BatteryPOP had acquired AVOD (streaming) rights to LoliRock for one year. On 1 April, France Televisions announced the release of episodes on France 4, and Disney France. Zodiak also reported that Italy would launch LoliRock on De Agostini Editore's Super! DTT channel. France 4 began broadcasting the 13 episodes on 4 April 2016. On 1 May, the first season of the series was released on Netflix, in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia. The LoliRock producers pre-released the four episodes of season 2 on YouTube in December 2016. > Netflix released the English dub of the season 2 episodes on 5 January 2017. It was broadcast on France 4 in February with two episodes per weekday. Reception Ella Anders of BSC Kids wrote that LoliRock \\"plays it clear as a magical girl series and even nods other iconic shows in the genera\\" such as Pretty Cure and Sailor Moon, but that it is \\"grand in its own right and should be held up as a great magical girl series\\". She liked the diverse cast, plot, humor and background story, the last of which she had not seen since My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, and that it was a type of show she would have loved growing up. Heather Newman of Forbes magazine described the series as \\"A French animated series about an impossibly thin, stylish, magical girl who sings.\\" When asked whether LoliRock would have a cross-over episode with French superhero show Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir from Zagtoon, Thomas Astruc, who was the creator and director on Miraculous and a storyboarder on LoliRock, said it was unlikely given they are from two different production companies, but that the animation community is small and that both companies share the same love of animation. He has posted about the two being cousin shows.  Other media  A LoliRock video game, available on iOS and Android, was released by Bulkypix in 2014. The game lets players sing to the songs featured on the show, record performances, and customise a sound studio and pick the girls' outfits. Zodiak has also worked a deal with publishing company Hachette Jeunesse to create novels, activity books, stationery, and e-books.

The novel follows the conversations, fantasies, and the emotionally dissociated states of a group of psychoanalysts gathered during a nocturnal pancake supper. The narrator‚Äôs predilection for starting food fights and instigating mayhem leads Bernhardt, the most grotesque and overbearing from among his colleagues, to hold him around his midsection almost for the duration of the novel while the narrator (named 'Tom') hallucinates himself hovering over the crowd. The New York Times called it, \\"A Freudian free-for-all,\\" and George Saunders hailed it as, \\"one of the most pleasure-giving, perverse, complicated, and addictive novels in the past 20 years,\\" in his article for Salon, which later became the book's introduction.  Plot summary  The Verificationist is set in early spring in an undisclosed New England city, at a pancake house where Tom‚Äîthe novel's protagonist‚Äîhas called together his fellow psychologists from the Krakower Institute for their biannual pancake supper. The conversations amongst the psychotherapists at these biannual pancake dinners are generally dedicated to ‚Äúthe seemingly everlasting task of reconciling classical metapsychology to our particular branch of Self/Other Friction Theory.‚Äù The narrative may be divided into three levels: what is happening in the diner, what is happening in Tom's \\"transient psychotic state\\", and what he imagines his wife, Jane, is doing at home. In the diner, the insecurities and neuroses of the psychotherapists in attendance are on display in their conversations, as interpreted by the relentlessly psychoanalyzing voice of the narrator. Tom attempts to start a food-fight, and the \\"patriarchal\\" Bernhardt lifts him into air, gripping him in a bear-hug. When Berhardt lifts Tom into the air, Tom experiences a sudden dissociative state, in which he imagines himself floating along the ceiling of the restaurant. Tom remains in this suspended state for the remainder of the novel. In Tom's \\"transient psychotic state\\" he is floating on the ceiling, with the obese Bernhardt trailing along behind him as a silent, psychologically symbolic patriarch. As the evening progresses, more of the characters join Tom and Bernhardt's hallucinatory flotilla: the waitress, the alcoholic Psychoanalyst Sherwin Lang, and the postdoctoral student who is in love with Lang. The question as to whether the hallucination Tom is having is a collective hallucination, shared by the other psychoanalysts, remains ambiguous throughout the narrative. Tom imagines his wife, Jane, (who is at home throughout the novel's action) committing various infidelities. Tom imagines Jane having a variety of sexual experiences both with himself and with other men. The difficult subject of their childlessness is a theme in his fantasies. Style The style Antrim deployed in his trilogy (of which The Verificationist is the concluding volume) is a mode of surrealism which resembles both magical realism and hysterical realism. The Verificationist's diction, in particular, may be characterized as being replete with the kind of psychoanalytic jargon that is the natural idiom of the book's psychoanalytic narrator, Tom. The Title It is unclear why Antrim chose to title this work The Verificationist as there is no clear link between the attitudes of the narrator and the philosophical movement from the early 20th century known as Verificationism.

Plot  Shamsher Singh owns a private island Al-Shifa for trading arms. Sikander Singh is Shamsher's step son, while Sanjana and Sooraj are his twin children. Yash is a close associate at Shamsher's empire and Sikander's confidante and Raghuvendra or more commonly known as Raghu chahcha is the bodyguard and close confidate to Shamsher. In a flashback scene, it is revealed that Rana Vijay is Shamsher's business rival and he creates problems for Shamsher's family business. As both Sanjana and Sooraj age to 25 years, their family lawyer explains the will of their deceased mother. As per the will, the twins are entitled for the rest of 50% of property as joint partner (25% share each), and the rest 50% for Sikander. This visible disparity causes the twins to hate Sikander even more as Shamsher preferred Sikander more than the twins. Shamsher tells both of them that Sikander is the son of his elder brother Ranchor Singh. In a flashback, that portrays the Handia village of the 1970s, the history of the Singh family is depicted. Both the Singh brothers used to supply weapons to Indian army. Local politicians of Handia asked them for illegal weapons to which Ranchor refused. His refusal caused rivalry with a local politician. One day, during an ambush on arms truck which was owned by Ranchor's company, Vijendar Singh's son was killed by Ranchor's gunshot. One day, Ranchor died when his car was exploded by a bomb. The arm's company owned by Singh family was then declared to be a legitimized anti-state and accused of supplying weapons to terrorists. Shamsher sends Sikander to Beijing for studies and takes Sikander's widowed mother to Al-Shifa. After 1 year the twins are born. Back to present day Al-Shifa, one night, Yash talks about his girlfriend. Sikander reveals that in Beijing he fell in love with a girl named Jessica who severed ties with him. Shamsher's childhood friend Brijmohan tells him that his friend's hotel was used by politicians for their lascivious motives where all the activity was captured on a spy video camera and stored on a hard disk. The hard disk was kept at a bank's locker in Cambodia. Shamsher appoints Sikander for the recovery of the hard disk, and he promises him to get back the disk. The next day, during a party it is revealed that Jessica is actually Yash's girlfriend. Sikander and Jessica meet privately in the security room. The very next day, Sooraj and Sanjana, who had recorded the Sikander-Jessica meet, screen the video to Yash. A furious Yash goes to Jessica's apartment and finds Sikander present with her. Sikander later tells him that both of their past interactions with Jessica were planned by Sooraj and Sanjana, as part of their plan to destroy Sikander. Yash teams up with Sikander against the twins but pretends to be with the twins as well. Sikander, the twins, Yash and Jessica execute the mission to recover the hard disk. After retrieving the hard disk, Shamsher eliminates Sikander by planting explosives in Sikander's car and heads to a conference with the politicians whose objectionable videos were stored on the disk. Shamsher tells about Sikander's death to the politicians, in the presence of the twins. He then plugs the hard disk and is shocked to find out that the disk was not the original one. Rather, it contained only one video of Sikander's mother. Sikander's mother self-filmed a video in which she reveals the truth that Ranchor was killed by Shamsher, and the twins were Ranchor's kids. Sikander arrives, and reveals that he knew that is Shamsher killed his dad, but kept it a secret for ten years and had been pretending to be loyal to Shamsher. Shamsher revealed that Yash is his real son to the twins before beating them up and before Sikander's arrival. After a fight scene in the desert between Sikander and Yash, Sikander demolishes the entire army of Shamsher and makes both Yash and Shamsher surrender to Jessica who happens to be an Interpol officer. The arrested father-son duo are flown to their native village Handia. In the climax, Sikander reveals that he had been planning all the events along and revealed all the plans and secrets to the twins and Jessica. Shamsher is seen bribing a police officer during jail proceedings, while Yash is seen to be toning his body inside the prison cell. Sikander, reuniting with his twin siblings in Al-Shifa reveals the plot of handing over the original hard disk to Jessica.

In the year 2016 it was reported that producer Ramesh Taurani had approached Salman Khan for Race 3 but he refused to do the film and asked Turani to make some changes in the script. This report was confirmed to be true by Khan himself at the Trailer launch event of the film on 15 May 2018. In August 2017, it was reported that Khan had agreed to be a part of Race 3 on the condition that choreographer turned director Remo D'Souza would be the one to direct the film. In August 2017 it was reported that Saif Ali Khan had decided not to be a part of the film as he was opposed to the idea of him playing a parallel lead to Khan. After media reports surfaced about Katrina Kaif, Jacqueline Fernandez and Deepika Padukone being considered for the female lead opposite Khan, it was confirmed during August 2017 that Fernandez had been finalised for the role. To prepare for the action sequences that she had to do in the film, Jacqueline underwent extensive training in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).  Filming  The shooting of the film began on 9 November 2017 at the Mehboob Studios in Mumbai. The filming of Race 3 moved to Bangkok in Thailand for its second schedule where they filmed a song and an action sequence, which was choreographed by Anal Arasu, at the Floating Market and Rose Garden as well as the jungles of Kanchanaburi Province. After finishing the shoot in Thailand, the production team reached Abu Dhabi for its next schedule. The shooting schedule in Abu Dhabi lasted for 35 days where filming was done at Emirates Palace, Yas Viceroy Abu Dhabi, The St Regis Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre, Emirates Steel and the Liwa Desert. The action sequences in Abu Dhabi were choreographed by Tom Struthers, who has previously worked on movies like Inception, The Dark Knight and Dunkirk. For its next schedule the film unit moved to Kashmir and later on to Ladakh where Salman Khan and Jacqueline Fernandez filmed a romantic song. During the shooting, Salman Khan was convicted in the Blackbuck poaching case on 5 April 2018 by a Jodhpur Sessions Court, as a result of which the remaining patchwork of the film was completed in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan instead of Abu Dhabi because the film was running behind its schedule and Jaisalmer had a landscape similar to that of Abu Dhabi.  Soundtrack  The music of the film is composed by Meet Bros, JAM8, Vishal Mishra, Vicky-Hardik, Shivay Vyas and Gurinder Seagal while the lyrics are penned by Salman Khan, Kumaar, Hardik Acharya, Shabbir Ahmed, Shloke Lal, Shivay Vyas, Shanky, Rimi Nique, Kunaal Vermaa and Raja Kumari.

Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave film 1/5 stars and called it a \\"mere show-reel....Best directed, with a ridiculous plot and sub-par acting, this is a new high for the superstar.....

Saibal Chaterjee of NDTV gave the film 1.5/5 stars praising its climax, and calling the rest \\"clue stuntman\\". Shreehari H of Qrius remarked the film to be one of the worst films of the year where Salman Khan seemed to be rather like a pterodactyl whose airborne exploits would have shamed many winged dinosaurs.

Priyadarshini Patya of MensXP.com rated the film 1/5 and said, \\"Race 3 is just Salman Khan's business, none of the viewers' business\\". Sonal Dehdia of Mid Day gave the film 1/5 stars and said, \\"There are two pehlus (aspects) to this film too ‚Äì first, it is atrocious and second, it will mint money at the box-office nonetheless\\". Dhavesh Sharma of Filmfare gave the film 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"A dysfunctional, ultra rich family, shady deals, fast cars, high speed chases, sassy women, macho men and enough plot twists to make Abbas Mustan go groggy with delight, Race 3 has all these and more'. Bollywood Hungama gave the film 2/5 stars and write, \\"On the whole, RACE 3 is high on style and low on substance\\". Ritika Handoo of Zee News, giving it 2.5/5 stars, said, \\"the action thriller lacks depth\\". Namrata Joshi of The Hindu criticized the film as a \\"compendium of inanities\\" and that the songs resembled standalone music videos.

Umesh punwani of Koimoi gave the film 2/5 stars and said, \\"On the whole Race 3 is not entirely unentertaining but it is majorly disappointing\\". Manjusha Radhakrishan of Gulf News gave the film 1.5/5 stars and called it \\"doomed adventure\\". Stutee Gosh of The Quint gave the film 1/5 stars and said \\"The moments of lull are so many in this 159-minute-long Race 3 that we develop a strange detachment from the on-screen proceedings\\". Suprana Sharma of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 1/5 stars calling it \\" a slow, dim-witted crawl to nowhere\\". Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle noted it to be an illogical yawn-fest, located too distant from reality and as Salman's worst act, ever. Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in criticized the film and noted that Even die-hard fans will find the going tough....Remo, (who) appears to have been too much in awe of his leading man to have actually given him any basic instructions on the sets..... Udita Jhunjhunwala of Livemint noted it to be a long film completely devoid of any minimal science or logic and with shoddy dance routines grooved on pedestrian lyrics. Tanul Thakur of Wire.in noted the film to be a garden variety shoddy joke, suffocated with numerous out-of-sync twists, disregarding logic, flow and consistency. Priyanka Bhadani of the Week.in gave the film 1/5 stars noting it to a logic defying bad spoof of a spoof with cringe-worthy dialogues and where Salman Khan got reduced to a caricature of his real life persona. The film made to multiple lists for being one of the worst films of the year with one remarking it to have \\"insulted the audience's intelligence\\".  Box office = Domestic  The film released on 4300 screens and collected 285.0 million on opening day in India becoming one of the biggest opener of the year.

Representative Charles Macheers (R-Shawnee) introduced the legislation on January 16, 2014. It passed in the House but was not taken up by the Kansas Senate. Background Kansas does not have any legislation preventing discrimination on the basis of either sexual orientation and gender identity. Based on an executive order by Governor Kathleen Sebelius, Kansas has prohibited discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation or gender identity (in government employment only) since 2007, and has since been repealed on February 10, 2015 by another Executive Order by the Governor of Kansas Sam Brownback. Although same-sex marriage is now legal throughout the United States since June 26, 2015, under the Obergefell v. Hodges decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. Supporters of this legislation felt religious individuals and institutions needed protection from getting sued or otherwise punished for denying services to gay and lesbian couples. Provisions The legislation says that no individual or religious entity shall be required by any governmental entity to do any of the following, if it would be contrary to the sincerely held religious beliefs of the individual or religious entity regarding sex or gender: *Provide any services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges; provide counseling, adoption, foster care and other social services; or provide employment or employment benefits, related to, or related to the celebration of, any marriage, domestic partnership, civil union or similar arrangement. *Solemnize any marriage, domestic partnership, civil union or similar arrangement. *Treat any marriage, domestic partnership, civil union or similar arrangement as valid. Reception The legislation passed the state's Republican-dominated House on February 12, 2014, by a 72‚Äì49 vote. State Senate President Susan Wagle said she anticipated that the bill would not pass the Senate: \\"A strong majority of my members support laws that define traditional marriage, protect religious institutions, and protect individuals from being forced to violate their personal moral values. However, my members also don't condone discrimination.\\" On February 18, the Catholic bishops of Kansas reiterated their support. Representative Emily Perry (D-Overland Park) criticized the bill, citing a hypothetical example of emergency services personnel such as a police officer who, arriving at the scene of a domestic violence dispute, could endanger lives by refusing protective services. Holly Weatherford, spokeswoman for the Kansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said \\"Kansas would be the first state to legalize discrimination on the part of employees‚Äîgovernment employees.\\" The Kansas Chamber of Commerce said it wanted coverage of private businesses and nonreligious entities removed from the bill. Others disputed whether a distinction can be made between acting on the basis of a same-sex marriage and acting on the basis of sexual orientation. On February 19, Senator Jeff King (R-Independence), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said his committee would not consider the legislation, ending its consideration. The bill's opponents characterize it as establishing second-class citizenship for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, while its supporters believe it prevents the state from requiring anyone to perform an action he or she sincerely believes to be wrong as a matter of religious principle.

The congregation was founded in 1903 as the Second Southern Presbyterian Church and took its current name in 1919. The congregation resides in a Gothic Revival church located at 22nd Street NW and P Street NW. The building was designed by architect Benjamin C. Flournoy of Baltimore, Maryland, and completed in March 1929. History=Formation and first pastor The congregation got its start about September 1902. Several residents of the city sent a petition to the Virginia synod of the Presbyterian Church in the United States (commonly described as the Southern Presbyterian Church), asking them to send an evangelist to the city for the purpose of organizing a new congregation. The synod agreed, and The Reverend B. F. Bedinger was sent to the city about November 1, 1902. Within a week, he had organized about 40 members into a body of like-minded worshippers. The group began meeting and worshipping together in December 1902, and the congregation formally organized on January 25, 1903, as the Second Presbyterian Church South ( Second Presbyterian Church). Bedinger served as the first pastor, Dr. Otho M. Muncster and E. H. Cumpston as the first elders, and Dr. George DuBose, James J. Royster, and William S. Feland the first deacons. There were 43 members of the congregation, and 18 members of the Sunday School. The congregation first worshipped in a house located at 2145 P Street NW. Bedinger stayed with the church for seven months before leaving. Left without a pastor, the congregation dwindled to 26. On January 31, 1904, Rev. Harry Waddell Pratt, an energetic pastor in his 30s, accepted the call to be the congregation's first permanent pastor. The congregation grew swiftly, and by September 1904 had purchased land on 22nd Street NW between P and Q Streets for a permanent church home. Ground for the new structure was broke on October 24, 1904, and the cornerstone laid on November 24. The congregation occupied the new church on January 1, 1905, with 82 members of the congregation in attendance. Second pastor and building addition Rev. Pratt resigned in the fall of 1910 to take a position as pastor of a Southern Presbyterian Church congregation in Abbeville, South Carolina. His replacement was Reverend Andrew Reid Bird, D.D., a 31-year-old from Baltimore, Maryland. The Rev. Dr. Bird was formally installed on March 6, 1911. In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson, himself the son of a Southern Presbyterian Church minister, began worshipping occasionally at Church of the Pilgrims. Wilson became a close friend of Dr. Bird's, and the two spent many days golfing together. By 1917, the Second Presbyterian Church South congregation had outgrown its existing structure. With World War I raging, the church had no money or materials to build with, and construction workers were all assigned to war production industries. To obtain building materials, Rev. Bird asked his congregation to donate their manual labor to the expansion effort. Men of the congregation demolished a building at 5th Street NW and New York Avenue NW for free; in exchange, the owner donated second-hand building materials to the church for construction of an addition. The addition was built in 1918 by Rev. Bird, men from the congregation, and a local Boy Scouts of America troop. With the addition, the church could now seat 200 people at a time. In 1919, Rev. Dr. Bird convinced the congregation to change its name to Church of the Pilgrims. The new name was first used in December 1919. New building With the congregation having grown significantly under both Pratt and Bird, Rev. Bird began traveling extensively throughout the Deep South to raise funds for a new church building. The response was enthusiastic. The nine-year fundraising campaign culminated in 1927, with more than $200,000 ($ in dollars) in donations from congregations throughout the Deep South. The church used a portion of the funds to purchase a large lot just south of its existing structure. Architect Benjamin C. Flournoy, of the Baltimore firm of Flournoy and Flournoy, was hired to design the structure. Flournoy designed a complex that included a church, a Sunday School building, and a parsonage. Each structure was three stories high, and contained a basement. The basement of the church contained a social hall and meeting rooms (with one room specifically set aside for use by the Boy Scouts). The basement of the school building housed a bowling alley. The three structures were arranged to mimic the layout of a medieval abbey, and resemble Late English Gothic architecture. The church building had a single tower, and the parsonage was in the rear. The brick, concrete, and stone structure had was long on 22nd Street NW, and extended back from the street. It was expected to have a seating capacity of 1,000. Ground was broken for the new building on June 25, 1927. By April 1928, the cost of the building had risen to $250,000 ($ in dollars), and by late May 1928 to $300,000 ($ in dollars). A new fund-raising effort was begun to raise the needed extra funds. Among the donations raised at this time was a pledge by Sarah Ecker Watts Morrison, wife of Governor Cameron A. Morrison of North Carolina, to donate a $20,000 ($ in dollars) pipe organ to the finished church. The Rev. Dr. John B. Frazier, a Southern Presbyterian minister and former chief chaplain in the United States Navy, conducted much of this fundraising, emphasizing that the Church of the Pilgrims was going to be a gift to the nation from the Southern Presbyterian Church. Construction began in May 1928, with the George A. Fuller Co. conducting the work. By July 1928, the cost of the completed structure was $400,000 ($ in dollars). Rev. Bird repeatedly called for members of the church to donate their manual labor in constructing the edifice. On July 30, 1928, Bird and other members of the congregation actually dug a trench for the foundation of an arch on the property. Seating in the church was scaled back to 750, the building capable of adding mezzanine seating for another 250. The cornerstone of the new church was laid on October 13, 1928, by Rev. Dr. Frazier. The new Church of the Pilgrims held its first service at 11 A.M. on Easter Sunday, March 31, 1929. Clad in Rockwood limestone from Colbert County, Alabama, the church's pews were inscribed with names of congregations making donations to the church. The final cost of the complex was $400,000 ($ in dollars). The church itself was dedicated in May 1929. The organ, Skinner Organ Co. Opus 744, was installed in late May or early June 1929. The Rev. Dr. Bird retired as pastor of Church of the Pilgrims in 1956, and died three years later.

Termite-inspired robots or TERMES robots are biomimetic autonomous robots capable of building complex structures without a central controller. A prototype team of termite-inspired robots was demonstrated by Harvard University researchers in 2014, following four years of development. Their engineering was inspired by the complex mounds that termites build, and was accomplished by developing simple rules to allow the robots to navigate and move building blocks in their environment. By following these simple rules, the robots could construct complex structures through a process called stigmergy, without requiring constant human instruction or supervision. Background Social insects such as termites are capable of constructing elaborate structures such as mounds with complex tunnel systems. They are capable of doing so without an overall plan for the design of a structure, without directly communicating information with each other about how to construct a structure, and without a leader to guide them in constructing a specific structure. Roboticists have been interested in the problem of whether robots can be designed with the limited sensory and motor capabilities of insects such as termites and yet, by following simple rules, construct elaborate and complex structures. Robots As part of the TERMES project, the Harvard team designed each robot to perform a few simple behaviors: to move forward, move backward, turn, move up or down a step the size of a specially designed brick, and to move while carrying a brick on top of it. To perform these locomotor behaviors, each robot was equipped with whegs. To detect features of its environment and other robots, each robot was equipped with the following sensors: seven infrared sensors to detect black and white patterns for navigation; an accelerometer to detect tilt angle for climbing; and five ultrasound sonar detectors for determining distance from the perimeter and to nearby robots. To lift, lower, and place the specially designed bricks, each robot had an arm with a spring-loaded gripper to hold a brick while carried. The project's specially designed construction bricks were 21.5 cm √ó 21.5 cm √ó 4.5 cm, which was bigger than the footprint (17.5 cm √ó 11.0 cm) of the robots. Constructing structures During the Harvard trials, groups of termite-inspired robots constructed structures by stigmergy. That is, instead of directly communicating with each other, the robots detected features of their environment and followed simple rules for moving and placing bricks in response to the configuration of bricks that existed at a given time. The rules for constructing a given structure were designed to guarantee that different structures emerged depending on the number of robots involved and on the initial placement of bricks. The TERMES robots constitute a proof of concept for the development of relatively simple teams of robots that are capable of constructing complex structures in, for example, remote or hostile locations. The Harvard researchers who built the initial termite-inspired robots have speculated that future robots could be designed to build a base for human habitation on Mars in preparation for the arrival of human astronauts. More immediate possibilities include teams of termite-inspired robots that are capable of moving sandbags and building levees in flood zones.

In 1960 Jim Navarra became the sole owner, and in 1968 he renamed the store Jerome's Furniture Warehouse after his son Jerome. Reluctant to sell furniture for a living, Jerome \\"Jerry\\" Navarra originally thought he might attend medical school. However, in 1970 after finishing a business degree at San Diego State University, he spent six months helping out at the store. Having enjoyed the experience, Jerry Navarra decided to stay, with the store eventually becoming his responsibility. Between 1980 and 1990, four branches were added in the San Diego Metro Area: San Marcos, Chula Vista, El Cajon, and Scripps Ranch. The original downtown store was moved in 2000 to West Morena Boulevard. Between 2009 and 2013 four more locations were added, which opened up the Los Angeles market. By 2015 Jerome's had a total of 11 stores and a turnover of over $147 million, and had attained a top-fifty furniture retail ranking. Its strategies include selling its goods for a standard competitive price without periods of discounting, and offering free design services.

Background Jones and Griffin had previously fought earlier in 1997 on March 21. Jones, who was the number one ranked pound-for-pound fighter in all of boxing, was making the first defense of the WBC light heavyweight title he had won on November 22, 1996 after defeating Mike McCallum against the undefeated Montell Griffin, who held the WBU light heavyweight title and was the top ranked light heavyweight by the WBC. Griffin was able to control the early portion of the fight, but Jones eventually rebounded and took control of the latter portion of the bout. The fight was still close entering round nine, as Jones took a narrow lead on two of the judge's scorecards (77‚Äì75 and 76‚Äì75), while Griffin held a 76‚Äì75 lead on the third. Griffin would control most of the first two minutes, but Jones was able to hurt Griffin with a right hand as the second minute ended. Jones then attacked Griffin in hopes of scoring a knockout victory, causing Griffin to voluntarily take a knee to avoid further punishment. While Griffin was on his knee, however, Jones illegally hit Griffin with a right-left combination. Jones initially thought he had picked up the victory via knockout, but referee Tony Perez announced that he had disqualified Jones for the illegal blows and Griffin was awarded the victory by disqualification, becoming the new WBC light heavyweight champion and the first person to defeat Jones as a professional.First Loss for Jones By Disqualification, N.Y.

Less than 20 seconds into the fight, Jones sent Griffin down into the ropes with a left hook for an official knockdown. Following the knockdown, Jones stalked towards Griffin, constantly attacking him with power punches. Griffin attempted to keep Jones at bay with his jab but was unable to establish himself as he had in the previous fight. Then with around 42 seconds left in the round, Jones caught Griffin flush with a leaping left hook that put Griffin down on his back.

Volokolamsk Highway (Russian: –í–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–º—Å–∫–æ–µ —à–æ—Å—Å–µ) is a novel written by Alexandr Bek, published in Russian in 1944, with later translations into English, Hebrew, Spanish, Chinese, German and many other languages during the 1940s and '50s. The novel, based on real events in October, 1941, during the Battle of Moscow, describes defensive fighting over several days by a single battalion of the 316th Rifle Division against elements of German Army Group Center. Both for its realism and for its practical advice on infantry tactics in modern war, Volokolamsk Highway became standard reading for junior officers in the Red Army and later Soviet Army, the forces of the arising State of Israel, and most socialist and revolutionary movements during the latter part of the 20th century. The novel has been out of print in English for several decades.  Creation and inspiration  After a short term of service as a volunteer in the 8th (Krasnaya Presnya) Volunteer Rifle Division,Rodric Braithwaite; Moscow 1941; Vintage Books, New York, 2007; p 109 Bek, who already had an established reputation as a writer, was reassigned as a war correspondent. In March, 1942, he was attached to the former 316th Rifle Division, now the 8th Guards \\"Panfilov\\" Rifle Division, where he met then-Captain Baurjan Momysh-Uly.This is the spelling of his name used in the English translation, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, c. 1945 Bek had been told of Momysh-Uly's heroic conduct as a Senior Lieutenant in command of the 1st Battalion of the 1077th Rifle Regiment in the October battles before Moscow. Bek saw this as the basis of a lightly-fictionalized novel to commemorate the defenders of the Soviet capital. Momysh-Uly was very reluctant to cooperate, but he eventually gave his story, and Bek captured his reluctance in the novel. In the end, Momysh- Uly strongly disapproved of Bek's book, which he claimed to be an unrealistic depiction of events, and criticized the author relentlessly for the remainder of his life.Brandon Schechter.

Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (August 1, 2009). pp. 4-5, 27, etc.. He later produced his own series of books to tell the story from his perspective.Rodric Braithwaite; Moscow 1941; Vintage Books, New York, 2007; pp 268, 355 Plot summary The structure of the novel is as an interview between a war correspondent and the commander of the battalion. The opening paragraph is as follows: The remainder of the novel is almost entirely told in the first person by Momysh-Uly, and is in two parts. Part One begins with Momysh-Uly and the correspondent negotiating the terms of their collaboration. Momysh-Uly then recounts the arrival of the battalion along the Ruza River west of Moscow in October, 1941. In order to combat fear among his men he finds it necessary to order the execution of a sergeant who has deserted the line and shot himself through the hand. The next day he goes on to try to convince his men that their duty is not to die for their country, but to make their enemies die for theirs. Division commander I.V. Panfilov arrives in the battalion's position on Oct. 13. He points out that while the defensive positions of the battalion are good, Momysh-Uly has made no provisions for offensive action in the no-man's-land between the Ruza and the Germans. A party of picked men then successfully stage a deep raid at night against a German-held village, raising the morale of the entire battalion. The story then goes back to July. The division is being organized near Alma-Ata, from men from Kazakhstan (like Momysh-Uly) and Kirghizia. The remainder of Part One describes the formation and training of the division, the growing personal relationship between Momysh-Uly and Panfilov, and the sound advice the former takes from the latter. Part Two begins with the battalion dug in very thinly along the Ruza, trying to cover a sector 8 km wide. Other sectors are coming under attack from German tanks. Panfilov visits for an hour, and persuades Momysh-Uly to send two platoons into no-man's-land to set up ambush positions along the two roads leading to his sector, and describes how they should fall back to the main position. One platoon is very successful in this operation, but the second cuts and runs after its first encounter. On Oct. 23 the main position comes under attack, with an artillery barrage directed by a spotting aircraft. Much of the barrage falls on dummy positions, and the battalion takes few casualties. Just as German infantry are about to attack, the Russian artillery observer is wounded by German shellfire, and Momysh-Uly (who is a former artilleryman) takes over, directing fire from the eight guns supporting his battalion from a church steeple. This fire blunts the German attack. At the close of the day, Momysh-Uly learns that Germans to his north have penetrated the front, and that the scratch battalion to his south has been routed; he is facing encirclement. He helps lead a counter-attack to the north, then orders a retreat eastwards to a grove of woods. Following this, he is presented with 87 stragglers from the routed scratch battalion. At first he wants nothing to do with them, as they had already broken and run once. On impulse he decides to test them, by leading them into a night counter-attack against the Germans in the village they have captured just east of the Ruza. To his surprise, all 87 follow him and redeem themselves by killing Germans, destroying a lot of their equipment, and burning their bridge across the river. He then welcomes them to join his battalion. He further orders them to recover their battalion guns, which delays the withdrawal of the rest of the battalion, almost fatally. In the end, Momysh-Uly devises a tactic to enable his entire combat group to escape from encirclement, breaking through German forces bogged down in the mud, and the troops rejoin the division in Volokolamsk, much to the approval of Gen. Panfilov.  Impact of the Novel  Bek also wrote two sequels, Several Days and General Panfilov's Reserve.Alexander Bek. sovlit.com. The series gained international, as well as Soviet, recognition: Published in Hebrew in 1946, Volokolamsk Highway \\"held an almost cult status in the Palmach and later in the Israeli Army\\" according to media researcher Yuval Shachal,Journal of Media History in Israel, November 2007, pp. 6e. and became a standard tactical handbook in the Israeli Defense Forces.Braithwaite, p. 298. Inspired by the novel, future Israeli Chief of the General Staff Motta Gur once held a \\"Panfilov Roll Call\\" for two soldiers who deserted from his company when he was a young officer, shaming them in front of the other troops; he wrote that it was a common practice in the IDF at the time.Motta Gur.

Scharfenberger attended Our Lady of Miraculous Medal Elementary School in Ridgewood, Queens, and graduated from Cathedral Preparatory Seminary High School in 1965. In 1969, Scharfenberger graduated with a degree in English from Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Douglaston, Queens. He \\"earned a bachelor's degree in sacred theology in 1972 from Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome; earned a licentiate in sacred theology from the Academy of St. Alphonsus in Rome in 1977 and a licentiate in canon law from Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., in 1980; graduated with a law degree from Fordham University in 1990\\"; and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1991. Ordination and ministry Scharfenberger received his priestly ordination July 2, 1973, in St. Peter's Basilica at the hands of Bishop James Hickey, rector of the North American College. He was incardinated into his native diocese, the Diocese of Brooklyn. Scharfenberger was pastor of St. Matthias Church in Ridgewood from 2003 to 2014. In addition to doing pastoral work for decades, he held various roles in the diocesan curia. He served as a member of the diocesan tribunal, a judicial vicar, an adviser to the canonical Ordinary, and a promoter of justice and member of the committee for sexually abused children. From 2013, he was the episcopal vicar for Queens. Scharfenberger is polyglot and speaks fluent Italian, Spanish and German. He speaks enough Polish to celebrate Mass, and knows some Hebrew, Russian and Portuguese as well. Bishop of Albany On February 11, 2014, Pope Francis appointed Scharfenberger Bishop of Albany. He was consecrated and installed by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, on April 10, 2014, at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. Apostolic Administrator of Buffalo On December 4, 2019, Pope Francis appointed Scharfenberger Apostolic Administrator of Buffalo, New York, following the resignation of Bishop Richard Malone. According to The New York Times, Malone resigned his post following a Vatican investigation on the handling of sex abuse matters in the Diocese of Buffalo. The Times reported that in recent years, Scharfenberger had \\"gained a reputation for taking a more empathetic approach in his handling of the abuse crisis.\\" At a news conference announcing his appointment, Scharfenberger said, \\"I am here to walk with you, and I am [here] to help you heal.\\" Scharfenberger's responsibilities as Bishop of Albany are unchanged. ViewsAbortion= In keeping with Catholic teachings, Scharfenberger is pro-life and against abortion. In February 2017, Scharfenberger criticized three Catholic politicians, Mayor of Albany Kathy Sheehan, State Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy and Congressman Paul Tonko, for supporting and attending a rally for Planned Parenthood. In January 2019, Scharfenberger wrote an open letter to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in response to the passage of the Reproductive Health Act: =Interfaith dialogue= On March 8, 2016, at an interfaith event, Scharfenberger said: \\"Christians cannot be anti-Semitic and be Christian.\\" In July 2019, Scharfenberger was appointed by Pope Francis as consultor to the Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews. On October 18, 2018, Scharfenberger celebrated the feast day of Our Lady of Walsingham together with dean Leander Harding at the Episcopal Cathedral of All Saints in a celebration that is observed both by Catholics and Anglicans. Afterwards Scharfenberger told the Episcopalian congregation that there were more similarities than differences between the two denominations. =Sexual abuse crisis= Scharfenberger said in 2018 that laypeople should investigate bishops accused of sexual abuse and failure to address cases of sexual abuse. In responding to Donald Wuerl's suggestion that a committee of bishops should investigate allegations into other bishops in the aftermath of the sexual abuse scandal of former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, Scharfenberger said that \\"we have reached a point where bishops alone investigating bishops is not the answer.\\" On April 28, 2020, Scharfenberger sent a letter to 23 suspended, as well as accused, Diocese of Buffalo clergy, informing them that due to the Diocese's bankruptcy agreement, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo can no longer pay them or provide them with retirement funds, health care, car insurance or dental care effective May 1, 2020.https://buffalonews.com/2020/04/28/buffalo-diocese-stops-paying-priests- accused-of-abuse/  Images  File:Bishop Edward Scharfenberger - Easter Vigil - 2019.04.20.jpgScharfenberger performs the opening rites of the 2019 Easter Vigil in the light of the new fire, at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Albany, NY.
