Executive produced by David Sloan, and gaining an average viewership of 7.77 million viewers per episode, ABC renewed the show for a second season on May 13, 2008.

These two experiments led Chris Whipple to conceive the idea for a television show in which \\"rather than show how people act in manufactured situations when they know they’re being watched, they show [the viewer] how people act when they don’t.\\" The new show, titled Primetime: What Would You Do?, began to appear periodically on ABC's Primetime, from 2005 to 2007. The new show became an instant success for the ABC network, with ratings doubling for each new episode. Because of this, ABC decided to make the show into its own series (ordering five new episodes) and decided to air them in November 2007. This was delayed due to the 2007 writers’ strike, and led for the new episodes to premiere on February 26, 2008, and caused the first season to consist of four episodes, instead of its original five.

Early life  Born in the town of Lochgilphead, Argyll, in western Scotland, Fraser was the second of eight children born to The Reverend William Fraser (1824–1892), minister of the Free Church of Scotland in Lochgilphead,; ; and Violet Ferguson (1835–1888). Fraser studied at the University of Glasgow.  Career  The Burns Memorial and Cottage Homes The Dunoon Pavilion, which opened in 1905, became a local landmark in the Scottish town. Fraser designed the Dunoon Primary School in 1899. Scotland From 1883 to 1888, Fraser apprenticed with the architecture firm of John McLeod in Glasgow. In 1889, the year following the death of his wife, Fraser moved to London, where he served as assistant to architect William Warlow Gwyther and in 1891 was elected as an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA). Fraser won the competition to design the Burns Memorial and Cottage Homes in the town of Mauchline, East Ayrshire, to honour Scottish poet and lyricist Robert Burns, who rented Mossgiel Farm near Mauchline from 1784 to 1788, where he composed many of his best-known works. The foundation stone was laid in 1896. After winning the design competition, Fraser established his own independent architecture practice. The monument, also called the National Burns Memorial, features a tower designed in the Scottish Baronial architectural style and cottages that \\"were intended as a permanent living memorial to the poet symbolising his sympathy for the genuinely unfortunate.\\" Today, the tower houses a contemporary art gallery, while the cottages continue to provide accommodation and facilities for elderly residents.; In 1897, a commemorative water fountain was erected in Lochgilphead, built to a design by Fraser, in memory of his older brother Alexander Rodger Fraser (1865–1894), who had served as a resident physician with the Bengal Collieries of the British East India Company in Bengal, India, and who died in the Red Sea while travelling home. In 1898, Fraser settled in the town of Dunoon, Argyll, where he was commissioned to design several public buildings, including the Dunoon Grammar School (now the Dunoon Primary School and a :Category B listed building); and the Dunoon Pavilion, which was officially opened on 17 August 1905 by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll and her husband John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll. The Pavilion, which included a multi-purpose public-meeting and concert hall, a restaurant and shops, was destroyed by fire in 1949. Today's Queen's Hall stands on the site. Canada Fraser is credited with the design of the Lillian Massey Building, which was built between 1908 and 1912 for the University of Toronto's Household Science program. In 1907, Fraser and his family emigrated to Toronto, Canada, where he joined the architecture firm of George M. Miller as an associate and worked on projects for the influential Massey family and \\"where he was credited with the design of the Deaconess' Home, St. Clair Avenue West (1908–09) and the refined Beaux-Arts scheme for the School of Household Science\\", which is now called the Lillian Massey Building. In 1911, Fraser established an independent architecture practice specializing in the design of educational buildings. One of his largest commissions was for the Anderson Building in downtown Toronto. Fraser was contracted by the Government of Canada to provide architectural services for the rebuilding of Halifax, Nova Scotia, after the Halifax Explosion devastated the city on 6 December 1917, when the French munitions ship exploded in Halifax harbor, killing approximately 2,000 people. Fraser worked for two years in Halifax, where he designed two public schools and a Bank of Nova Scotia building, but while there he fell ill from cancer and had to return to Toronto in 1921. He died on 14 June 1922, aged 54. Personal life Fraser married Maud Marion Timpson in Dunoon, Argyll, in 1898, and they initially settled in the town. They had three children. Maud Timpson survived her husband by 45 years; she died in 1967, aged 92.

Working in a wide variety of materials, she focused on plants, animals and people, all depicted in strong abstract forms. Her works form part of the permanent exhibitions of the National Museum of Denmark and can be seen in the Museum of Aabenraa and in Hjørring's Sculpture Park. Some of her more recent creations decorate the garden of the Carlsberg Foundation in Copenhagen. Biography Born on 30 November 1915 in Helsingør, Sigrid Helga Lütken was the daughter of Major General Louis Carl Frederik Lütken (1863–1918) and Gertrud Thürmer. From 1936 to 1941, she studied sculpture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Einar Utzon-Frank. Her early works follow naturalistic trends, depicting human figures and animals which are frequently in motion. Her later works are increasingly abstract, covering fruits, plants or birds in an ornamental style with simple cubic shapes. Her materials include granite, cast iron, stoneware and bronze. From 1954, Lütken exhibited with the Grønningen artists and from 1965 with the group known as Koloristerne. From the 1980s, as a member of the selection committee, she participated in the exhibitions at Vrå Hojskole. Her last exhibitions were in early 2008 at Den Frie Udstilling and in Hobro together with works by her husband, the sculptor Bent Sørensen (1923–2008). In 1972 she was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and in 1994 the lifelong award from the Danish Arts Foundation. Sigrid Lütken died on 2 March 2008 and is buried in the Lundtofte Churchyard.

They ceased to be awarded in 1947 on Indian independence. Establishment The system for bestowing titles on prominent Indians pre-dated the British presence in India. As part of a wider awards system, the British used these traditional Indian titles to reward native Indian civilians and Viceroy's commissioned officers of the Indian Army for faithful service and acts of public welfare. At the Delhi Durbar celebrations in 1911, King George V established a series of badges to be worn by title holders, enabling them to publicly display the title held. The award was dis-established in 1947, upon Indian independence.Sharma, B. K. Introduction to the Constitution of India, Published by Prentice-Hall, India, 2007, , p. 83. Classes There were three classes, each sub-divided to reflect the religion, and sometimes region, of the title holder. First Class *Sardar Bahadur, for Muslims; *Diwan Bahadur, for Hindus; Second Class *Khan Bahadur, for Muslims; *Rai Bahadur (North India) or Rao Bahadur (South India), for Hindus; Third Class *Khan Sahib, for Muslims; *Rai Sahib (North India) or Rao Sahib (South India), for Hindus. Those of other religions received the title considered most appropriate, for example native Indian Christians with a Hindu sounding name would receive a Hindu title, with Jews receiving a Muslim title. Title badges took precedence after all British and Indian orders and decorations, and before campaign medals. In most cases, recipients proceeded from the lowest class to the higher grades, with only the most senior title, and badge, used. Ranking below a knighthood, these titles were dropped by any holder who became a knight of a British Order, for example the Order of the Star of India or the Order of the Indian Empire. Members of the first class of the Order of British India could also use the title of Sardar Bahadur, with members of the second class using Bahadur. In these cases, the Title Badge was not worn. Appearance The badge consisted of a radiant star topped by an imperial crown, with a laurel wreath draped below the crown. A central medallion bore the appropriate title on a band surrounding the crowned profile of the king, either George V or George VI. Facing right until 1933, the design was then changed to show George V's bust facing left. The George VI version showed his bust facing left. The reverse was plain, and was engraved with the name and details of the recipient. All three classes were the same size: in height and wide, differentiated by their metal finish and ribbon: * 1st class: silver gilt with the title displayed on the central medallion enamelled pale blue. The ribbon was light blue edged with dark blue; * 2nd class: silver gilt without enamel. The ribbon was red edged with dark red; * 3rd class: silver with the title displayed on the central medallion enamelled dark blue. The ribbon was dark blue edged with light blue. All three classes were worn around the neck from the wide ribbon, although the badge was sometimes unofficially worn on the left chest alongside other medals.

His research into iodine deficiency and endemic goitre led to the introduction of iodised salt in Slovakia. Biography Podoba was born in 1916 in western Slovakia. His father was a farmer and a member of parliament in the First Czechoslovak Republic. Podoba began studying medicine at Comenius University in Bratislava in 1934 and graduated in 1940. During the Second World War, he was forced to resign from his post at the Martin University Hospital because he disagreed with Slovakia's alliance with Nazi Germany, and began working instead at the Hospital of the Workers Social Security Alliance in Bratislava. After the war, he studied endocrinology at Charles University in Prague under Josef Charvát, who was regarded as one of the founders of endocrinology in Czeschoslovakia, and Karel Šilink. When Podoba returned to Slovakia, he carried out research into endemic goitre based similar field studies conducted by Šilink in Czechia. His research, carried out from 1949 to 1953, showed that most of the Slovakian population was iodine deficient. In some regions, he found a prevalence of endemic goitre in women as high as 80% and cretinism (due to congenital iodine deficiency) as high as 3%. Unlike Šilink's investigations, Podoba also measured urinary iodine concentrations in his subjects, used perchlorate and phenylthiocarbamide tests, and attempted to identify genetic factors involved in the development of endemic goitre. The Slovak Ministry of Health established the Institute of Endocrinology in 1951 and Podoba was appointed its first director. The institute was incorporated into the Slovak Academy of Sciences in 1954 and renamed the Institute of Experimental Endocrinology in 1967. He became an associate professor of Comenius University in 1968, served as president of the Slovak Endocrine Society from 1967 to 1975, and founded the international medical journal Endocrinologia experimentalis. He retired in 1987 and died in 2005. Legacy Iodised salt was introduced in Slovakia in 1951 as a result of Podoba's research on iodine deficiency. As a result, the incidence of endemic goitre declined significantly and cretinism disappeared completely in children. Podoba was awarded the Medal of the President of Slovak Republic in 2003 and was inducted into the Slovak Medical Society's Hall of Fame of Slovak Medicine in 2019.

Career  In 2004, Ilina started teaching at the Mahatama Gandhi Antarashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalya in Wardha, where she joined as faculty in 2007. While at Wardha, she was the organising secretary of the Indian Association of Women's Studies (IAWS) conference in 2011 and then in Guwahati in February, 2014, during which she was also President of the IAWS. In 2009, Ilina Sen went back to academics and taught at the Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya in Wardha, Maharashtra before moving to Mumbai to teach at the Advanced Centre for Women’s Studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. She was a Senior Fellow in the Nehru Memorial Library from July 2013 to July 2015.  Activism in Chhattisgarh  In the early 1980s, Ilina moved to Chhattisgarh with her partner Binayak Sen, to work among the peoples of an Adivasi movement. Initially, Sen was involved with sustainable development to ensure the preservation of seed and rice varieties. She then started working in the trade union started by Shankar Guha Niyogi where she spent many years and worked with trade unions, Adivasis and the underprivileged. The couple spent many years working in rural Madhya Pradesh and were associated with an independent union of workers in the iron ore mining belt of the then Madhya Pradesh, called the Chhattisgarh Mines Shramik Sangatan (CMSS). They also worked with the Shaheed hospital of the CMSS, to provide healthcare within a working-class movement.

The syndrome is associated with premature death. SPS has been identified in children. Mechanism Glomerulus and Bowman's capsule. The blood filtered through the glomerular filtration barrier corresponds to the primary urine collected in the Bowman's capsule. It has been speculated that SPS is both caused by, and exacerbates, cardiovascular disease. It was stated in 2014 that the kidneys have a role in maintaining the equilibrium between production and catabolism of most proteins between about 5 and 30 kDa in molecular mass and that failure to do so results in serious disease and strongly increased mortality, when the kidney disorder shrunken pore syndrome was identified. Proteins less than 30 kDa comprise about 36% of the total human proteome. A hypothesis concerning the pathophysiology of SPS is that several 5–30 kDa proteins with signalling functions, for example cytokines, are increased in concentration and promote development of serious disorders like cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Diagnosis An eGFRcystatin C/eGFRcreatinine-ratio <0.60, or <0.70, in the absence of non-renal influences on eGFRcystatin C or eGFRcreatinine, identifies a condition as SPS. Optimal classification and stratification of chronic kidney disease requires not only analysis of GFR (estimated or measured) and albuminuria, but also determination of the eGFRcystatin C/eGFRcreatinine-ratio to assess the presence of SPS. Prognosis The mortality of SPS is higher than that of cancer, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease.

Since the 1970s, this palace has been the summer residence of the Spanish royal family, although their official residence in the Balearic Islands is the Royal Palace of La Almudaina. This is also the favourite palace of Queen Sofía, being the place where she lives most of the year. Unlike the official residence of the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, Marivent does not belong to the set of residences of the Spanish Royal Family property of the Patrimonio Nacional state agency, but its ownership corresponds to the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands. Despite this nature of a private residence, the Marivent Palace has served, on many occasions, as a setting for the receptions and interviews that the monarch offers both the Prime Minister of Spain and other international authorities.  History  leftThe property was built by the architect Guillem Forteza Pinya between 1923 and 1925, commissioned by the painter Juan de Saridakis, who lived there until his death. His widow, Anunciación Marconi Taffani, gave the building and its land to the Balearic Provincial Council in 1966, on condition that a museum be created bearing the name of the painter, and that it remained open to the public. These conditions were met until 1973 when the Provincial Council ceded the estate to the then Princes of Spain (Juan Carlos and Sofía), a fact that caused the descendants of Saridakis to sue the provincial authorities to the courts for non-compliance with the conditions of transfer, and to recover the movable property of the interior of the palace belonging to his family. However, sources of the autonomous government in the 1980s, on which the palace depended, declared that \\"We are relatively little concerned that these goods are taken, since they have little value\\", 40 million pesetas contrary to the 3,000 that the heir painter Juan de Saridakis claimed.

From 1933 to 1940 he was commissioner (governor) of the Orientale Province. Life Dufour was commissaire general at Elisabethville, acting for the governor who was absent in 1929 and 1930. In 1931 he was interim governor of Katanga Province. Dufour succeeded Alfred Alphonse Moeller (1889–1971) as commissioner of Stanleyville Province, the new name for Orientale Province. He held office from 1 October 1933 to 18 November 1940. In December 1934 Dufour wrote to the General Governor at Leopoldville about occupation of the Beni Territory (in what is now North Kivu), with attached letters and reports that led to a decision in favor of a military occupation. In 1938 Dufour was responsible for a serious automobile accident and was forced to pay a large fine by the Léopoldville court of appeal. In the late 1930s Dufour was the target of concerted and virulent attacks from La Belgika and the Kilo-Moto Gold Mines delivered by their influential representatives André Gilson, also president of the Association of Belgian Colonial Interests, and by General Georges Moulaert. They claimed that he failed to support colonial interests and caused great damage as a result. In 1939 the governor wrote to Dufour asking about the origin of a statement often attributed to him, that he would rather see his territorial agents in their bed than in a cotton field. The governor wanted to put an end to these attacks on Dufour. Although the governor's letter was friendly and personal, Dufour's reply was formal. In November 1938 General E. Hennequin, commander of the Force Publique, and Robert Reisdorff, the newly appointed replacement of M. Georges Mortehan as inspector of state, dined with Rodolphe Dufour. The general was placed to the left of the hostess and the inspector of state to the right. The general complained bitterly to the Minister of Colonies about what he saw as a public humiliation. Dufour's health deteriorated badly and he was replaced at the end of 1940 by Marcel Maquet (1891–1964). He died in South Africa before the end of World War II (1939–1945).

It is found in the Western Pacific Ocean. Description The oval grouper has a compressed, oval-shaped body and its depth is 2.0 to 2.8 times its standard length. It has an oblique mouth and the lower jaw projects beyond the upper jaw. The dorsal profile of the head is convex while the intraorbital area is rather wide and convex. The preopercle is not smoothly rounded, but is not sharply angled, and has fine serration on its margin which are enlarged at its angle. The gill cover has a convex upper edge and has three flat spines. The dorsal fin contains 11 spines and 19–21 soft rays while the anal fin contains 3 spines and 9–12 soft rays. The caudal fin is truncate to emarginate with rounded corners. The colouration is dark brown or violet-black on the body with darker fins. This species attains a maximum recorded total length of . Distribution The oval grouper is found in the eastern Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean where it has an anti-tropical distribution. In the Northern Hemisphere it has been recorded from Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Fujian. In the Southern Hemisphere it is found off the Dampier Archipelago in Western Australia, and from southern Queensland south as far as Wallis Lake, New South Wales. Habitat and biology The oval grouper has been recorded over on rocky or soft bottoms, consisting of sand or silty mud, at depths of . The juveniles are known to feed on zooplankton in the water column. Utilisation The oval grouper is frequently taken as by-catch by fishers using bottom trawls and it is valued as a food fish. Taxonomy The oval grouper was first formally described in 1842 as Serranus dermopterus in 1842 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck (1778-1858) and his student, the German ichthyologist Hermann Schlegel (1804–1884), with the type locality given as Nagasaki. In 1910 the American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan (1851–1931) and Robert Earl Richardson (1877–1935) placed the species in the genus Trisotropis which is now a synonym of Mycteroperca. However, this species does not closely resemble any species of Mycteroperca and this species was placed in the monotypic genus Triso by J.E. Randall, G.D. Johnson & G.R. Lowe in 1989. In 2018 a genetic study of the groupers found that the oval grouper fell within the genus Hyporthodus, but Fishbase retains it within Triso.

He produced his work in British India before partition and in Pakistan after split of Indian subcontinent. Most of his work revolves around traditional tales of Persian and Hindu mythology. He also depicted rural life, particularly culture of Punjab, Pakistan in his paintings. The recipient of national literary award, the Pride of Performance in 1963, he is primarily recognized for depicting tragic love stories of Sohni Mahiwal, Heer Ranjha and Tilism-e- Hoshruba, an epic story of Amir Hamza, a legendary Persian adventurer. Sometimes, he used to depict traditional festivals of Punjab. Some of his work he produced after independence was acquired by the National Art Gallery.  Life and background  He was born around 1895 in British India (in modern-day Wazirabad, Pakistan). He spent most of his life in Lahore. At first, he attended a Madrasa to study Urdu and Arabic, however, he subsequently left school. His father was a house painter who used to work at Mughalpura Railway Workshop.  Career  At the apparent age of five, he joined Master Abdullah who trained him in artwork. He was first asked to practice three English alphabets (ABC) on slate. It is believed he practiced letter \\"A\\" for the first three years, and later B and C letters to produce \\"ABC of art\\". He started his first artwork between 1913 to 1914 at Bhati Gate with nonrepresentational patterns. Initially, he copied Western painting to create visual characters, but later adopted original artwork with mythical subject. In 1914, he went to Bombay (now Mumbai) for a better career where he stayed for five years and worked at Roop Naraine Photographic Studio as a background artist. His initial efforts didn't help him to earn recognition. He later created paintings of Krishna, a major deity in Hinduism which helped him to be recognized as an artist. After practicing Punjabi folklore and Hindu mythology, he became known as a \\"romantic painter\\". The newspapers of that time referred to him as the \\"master painter\\". He moved back to Lahore in 1919 and worked as a commercial artist at Paisa Akhbar in Urdu Bazaar (Lahore) until 1922. Later in 1924, Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir offered him a job as a court-painter, but he declined the offer. He worked at the court of Bhupinder Singh of Patiala from 1937 to 1938. After he left the court, he created a landscape painting of a woman living in a village along with her kids which became one of his prominent paintings. During the last years of his life, he lost most of his eyesight due to cataract. Many people consider him as one of the pioneer artists of modern landscape and figurative painting in early years of Pakistan.  Death and legacy  He died in Pakistan on 18 October 1978. In 1991, Pakistan Post issued a commemorative postage stamp to honor Allah Bakhsh in its 'Painters Of Pakistan' series.

They are the most successful team in this competition too, winning it nine times. The 2003–04 season saw the introduction of the Andorran Supercup, a single match at the beginning of the season between the winners of the Primera Divisió and the Copa Constitució. Due to their regular domestic success FC Santa Coloma have qualified for the Supercup nearly every season with the exception of the 2013 edition. Their seven supercup wins is the most by a single club, meaning FC Santa Coloma are the most successful team in all three of Andorra's domestic football competitions. The club has never been relegated from the top division. The Andorran Football Federation joined as a member of both the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in 1996, allowing football clubs in Andorra to enter UEFA competitions. FC Santa Coloma first qualified for Europe with their league win in 2001, entering the qualifying round for the 2001–02 UEFA Cup, losing 8–1 on aggregate to Yugoslav team Partizan. Their first season in the UEFA Champions League was in the 2008–09 qualifying rounds, losing 7–2 on aggregate to Lithuanian team FBK Kaunas. Since 2007 the club has qualified for Europe each season entering either the Champions League or the Europa League (known as the UEFA Cup up to 2009). Their best run has been reaching the second qualifying round in both competitions.

The organisation is dedicated to saving queer kids from the consequences of disinformation about the LGBT community. Margot is mostly known for being arrested and accused by the police for slashing the tires of a truck used by , covering the truck with paint, physically confronting an activist, and joining other activists in decorating statues across Warsaw, including one of Jesus, with rainbow flags and pink masks. Activities According to Wprost investigation, in July 2018 Margot was involved in spray-painting the Sejm (lower chamber of the Polish parliament) and in November 2019 protested against giving an award to Roman Polański at a film festival which was taking place at the National Film School in Łódź. (which in Polish means \\"Stop Nonsense\\", or \\"Stop Bullshit\\" as adopted by the organisation's English language website), which she runs, is \\"a radical, queer collective\\". It was named in reaction to a proposed \\"Stop Paedophilia\\" bill that they viewed as being in large part against the LGBT community. On 27 June 2020, a truck belonging to an anti-abortion and pro-life foundation, , emblazoned with homophobic and anti-abortion slogans, equipped with loudspeakers, was confronted by a group of left wing activists, who slashed the tyres, damaged a mirror, stole the number plate and physically assaulted the driver. Margot was arrested for battery on 7 August 2020 and placed in police custody for a period of two months. Following the arrest, various groups of people protested her incarceration, claiming it was politically motivated. As a result, 48 more people were arrested in an event referred to as Polish Stonewall. She had been held in a detention facility in Płock, central Poland and was released on 28 August. Margot told the BBC that she only attempted to stop the truck driver from filming her with his mobile phone and did not assault him: \\"I wish I could have beat him up - but he was three or four times larger than me.\\" In August 2020, dozens of writers, filmmakers and actors from various countries around the world signed an open letter decrying the oppression Margot and other activists had suffered. Margot's activism has met with criticism from the vice-president of The Left's parliamentary club, Monika Pawłowska, as well as commentators generally viewed as liberals or leftists, including philosopher Jan Hartman and editor-in-chief of Newsweek Polska, Tomasz Lis. On 4 September 2020, Margot was released from imprisonment after a successful legal appeal. Following her release, she posted a photograph holding up her middle finger and holding a scrabble sign saying \\"Poland, you preek [sic], stop arresting my Margot\\". Margot, whose hunger strike in prison was suppressed by the authorities, stated she was willing to resume her hunger strike and die if it could counter Polish homophobia. On 7 September 2020, a protest in support of Margot was held in front of the martyrdom monument at Old Market square, Bydgoszcz. Views In a BBC interview in September 2020, Margot explained: \\"I want to show my community that we no longer have to live in fear [...] For years we've been asking for minimal provisions and legislation that would protect us - if not from discrimination, then at least from physical violence.\\" Regarding whether violence was a valid method of resistance, she answered: \\"People who have not lived the lives of the LGBT community in this country shouldn't judge us [...] And nobody should be surprised if we are eventually forced to take things into our own hands.\\" Personal life In an interview with the Polish edition of Vogue, Margot revealed that she is currently writing her Bachelor of Arts (BA) thesis on Christian anarchism. Margot lives with Łania Madej and is in a polyamorous relationship with her and a trans man Lu. While detained, Margot went on a hunger strike and requested a New Testament, later stating that Christianity is too serious a matter to be left in Polish Catholics' hands. Margot also stated that she is a Christian. Naming controversies Some controversies have arisen around Szutowicz's given name. Polish police and some media such as Polish Television, Onet.pl, or use Szutowicz's masculine name Michał in their statements. Liberal media outlets however, such as Gazeta Wyborcza, TVN, or OKO.press prefer to use Szutowicz's feminine name Małgorzata, while conservative media outlets like Najwyższy Czas!, Radio Maryja use her masculine name Michał. Politicians of the Law and Justice party such as Beata Mazurek or Piotr Uściński, also use Szutowicz's masculine name. According to psychologists Kamil Gulik and Dominik Haak, this misgendering is a form of violence against LGBT people that can cause suicidal thoughts. However, Szutowicz's partner Łania Madej has said that Szutowicz is not offended by being referred to as Michał.

Robert Clive is known to have decorated a number of sepoys for their service in the Monghyr Mutiny. A campaign medal is listed in some sources as having been awarded, and both the National Army and Victoria and Albert Museums hold a medal depicting Minerva, which they attribute to this action. Other sources dispute this and identify the Minerva medal as being awarded by a Freemasons lodge in Leipzig. If awarded, the medal would have been the earliest of those issued by the company in India.  Background  The Monghyr Mutiny, which took place in 1766, was a mass resignation of white officers of the East India Company's Bengal Army, over the withdrawal of the batta allowance. The mutiny was quelled without bloodshed by Robert Clive, who was then Governor of Bengal, with a few loyal officers and a number of Indian sepoy troops. He is known to have commended the sepoys for their good behaviour and to have decorated a number of their officers and non- commissioned officers. The entire force also received two-months double pay.  Medal  A Monghyr Mutiny campaign medal is listed in Steward (1915) as having been awarded by the East India Company in 1766. The National Army Museum holds a silver medal that it states is \\"believed to have been issued on the recommendation of Robert, Lord Clive, to the Indian officers of two Indian battalions who succeeded in quelling a mutiny among the European troops at Monghyr in Bengal, in June 1766\\". The Victoria and Albert Museum also holds one of these medals and describes it as having been given as a reward for service during the \\"batta disputes\\". It notes the medal is silvered by electrotyping and that the obverse shows Minerva, Roman goddess of wisdom, seated by some palm trees. The reverse shows laurel branches, the Latin inscription \\"non nisi digno\\" (only for the worthy)Cassell's New Latin-English Dictionary, 5th edition 1968. ' and the year \\"MDCCLXVI\\" (1766). The means of wearing the medal are not known but other early medals of the East India Company were worn suspended around the neck by means of a yellow cord. Chakravorty (1995) states that this was the \\"earliest medal issued by the Company on the Indian soil\\", while Clark (2016) notes that it was only awarded to Indian soldiers. The next known medal issued by the company is the Deccan Medal awarded in 1784. However doubts have been raised with regards to this medal. The Freemasons' Quarterly Review of 1846 lists a medal struck by the ' (Minerva with the three palms) lodge of Leipzig. This medal had \\"Minerva sitting under three palms\\" on the obverse and the same wreathed date and motto as the museum examples on the reverse. The British Numismatic Society identified the medal as that of the Minerva Lodge of the Freemasons in 1927. The United Service Institution of India noted in 1929 that the motto and depiction of Minerva make the medal better suited to a non-military application and that it \\"may be discarded as a military decoration\\". They also noted that it does not resemble any other medal ever issued by the East India Company and is not mentioned in its official records.

The convention was created and announced in June 2020, as Warner Bros. and DC's response to San Diego Comic-Con's cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The convention featured information about DC-based content including the DC Extended Universe film franchise, the Arrowverse television franchise, comic books, and video games. The main convention was held online as \\"DC FanDome: Hall of Heroes\\" on August 22, 2020. The second convention entitled \\"DC FanDome: Explore the Multiverse\\" followed on September 12, 2020.  Development  Development for a DC Comics-centric fan event was first conceived in April 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of E3 2020 and the eventual cancellation of San Diego Comic-Con 2020. On June 14, 2020, with Comic-Con replaced by a virtual Comic-Con@Home, Warner Bros. announced a separate DC-themed online-only convention. Dubbed as DC FanDome, the free \\"immersive virtual fan experience\\" was a 24-hour-long event held on August 22, 2020. The hosts and many of the panelists were sent production kits from DC to capture their full bodies on green screens so they could appear in the virtual Hall of Heroes stage designed by DC chief creative officer Jim Lee. Some of the larger panels that need to happen over video conference used unique backgrounds. The content for the event was shot over a two-week period at the end of July 2020, and was completed by August 15, 2020. On August 19, 2020, FanDome was announced to be split over two different days. The main presentation, entitled \\"DC FanDome: Hall of Heroes\\", was held as scheduled on August 22. The remaining programming was provided through a one-day video on demand experience, \\"DC FanDome: Explore the Multiverse\\", on September 12. Lisa Gregorian, Warner Bros. TV group president and chief marketing officer, and Blair Rich, president of worldwide marketing for Warner Bros. Pictures Group, revealed the decision to split the event into two dates came after hearing fan feedback from the initial schedule announcement saying there was too much content to consume in 24 hours. Fans and global audiences were able to log in freely without any usage of badge tags or financial purchasing much like the Comic-Con convention, and see new announcements and trailers for a variety of upcoming DC films, TV series, comics, and video games, including details on the Arrowverse television franchise. Virtual panels featured interviews from the cast and creators of many current and upcoming DC projects such as The Batman, Black Adam, The Suicide Squad, Zack Snyder's Justice League, Wonder Woman 1984, Shazam!: Fury of the Gods, The Flash, and other major film projects set in the DC Extended Universe franchise. The event was broadcast in English, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, French, German, and Italian. DC Comics plans to produce another iteration of a virtual event in the future, with Gregorian adding it could coexist with physical, in person events such as Comic-Con.  Cast of hosts and participants  In August 2020, DC Comics released a large list of hosts and participants including Matt Reeves, director of 2021's The Batman; its star Robert Pattinson; directors Zack Snyder, Patty Jenkins and James Gunn; and others from the DC Extended Universe film franchise. Thirteen global hosts from 14 countries were also used.  Attendance and engagement  DC FanDome: Hall of Heroes was viewed by 22 million people in 220 countries over its 24-hour live stream. \\"DC FanDome\\" also trended on Twitter and YouTube in 53 and 82 countries, respectively. Gregorian spoke to this, saying, \\"We reached a lot of fans around the world that we wouldn't normally be able to reach. We were able to have questions from India answered, or artwork looked at from the Philippines or South Africa, by the talent.\\"  References  External links  * Category:DC Comics Category:Multigenre conventions Category:Comics conventions Category:2020 in comics Category:August 2020 events Category:Events held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic ","title":"DC FanDome"},{"id":"64854292","title":"Khama Worthy"},{"id":"64854304","text":"Harini Amarasuriya () is a Sri Lankan academic, rights activist, university lecturer and politician who also served as a senior lecturer at the Department of Social Studies of the Open University of Sri Lanka.

History The are occupied by the street lay outside the Roman city walls, but fell within the Canabae of Eboracum, a residential and industrial area. It is believed that, during the Viking, Jorvik, period, the street formed the eastern side of a lengthy open area. The name of the street first appeared in 1303, arising from the charcoal merchants in the area. A statue of Ebrauk, the legendary founder of the city, stood where the street meets St Saviourgate; this may have been a reused Roman statue. Margaret Mason's Hospital, an almshouse, was built on the street in 1732, and survived until the 1950s. In 1829, the northern end of the street was widened by demolishing part of Holy Trinity, King's Court. The church was entirely removed in 1937, and King's Square enlarged, so Colliergate now runs up part of the east side of the square. The Colliergate Drill Hall was opened on the street in 1872, while Barnitts department store opened on the street in 1896. Over time, it has expanded, and it now occupies the drill hall, among other buildings. Architecture and layout The street runs from King's Square south to the junction of St Saviourgate and Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate. North of King's Square, its continuation is Petergate. Almost all the buildings on the street are listed. On the west side of the street, numbers 1 and 2, and 3, 4 and 4A date from the Georgian period. 5 Colliergate was originally built in the 16th- century, and is also noted for its modern ogee arched doorway. The street continues with building remodelled in the Georgian era: 6 and 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 and 14, of which 9 and 11 contain some Mediaeval material. On the east side, all the buildings are listed, most being Georgian. Nikolaus Pevsner describes number 18 and 19 Colliergate as the best building, built in 1748 by Ralph Yoward, while 23 is notable for its staircase, built in 1700.

She had eleven siblings, and in 1864 her elder sisters left her, aged fifteen, to care for her father, younger sister, and eight brothers at Hagley Hall. She escaped five years later when her father remarried and the following year she married. Her new husband however had become the warden at Keble College the year before and she had a new house to run. She took relief attending the lectures for women organised by an ad-hoc group which included Mary Ward, Louise Creighton and Charlotte Byron Green. Members of the committee who organised the lectures for women moved on to join the Association for Promoting the Education of Women in Oxford, including Mary Ward, Louise Creighton, Charlotte Byron Green and Lavinia Talbot. She was joined by her husband and many realised that they would need a new hall where women students could live whilst at university. The consensus was split on religious grounds and Somerville Hall, which ignored a woman's denomination was partnered by Lady Margaret Hall which the Talbots, as strong Catholics, supported. In 1913 she backed the controversial invitation of Maude Royden, a woman, to talk to the all-male Church Congress about White Slavery. Lavinia Talbot died in Wantage in 1939.

This Marriage was solemnised between Us John Moore Jane Wright In the presence of Mary Wright Cathe: Wright His father, James Wright of Warwick, purchased his wife's sisters' shares of the manor Hurstborne, and owned lands on Cubbington and Butlers Marston. Huband family His maternal grandparents were Sir John Huband, 2nd Baronet of Ipsley Court in Warwickshire and Rhoda, eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Broughton, Baronet of Broughton in the county of Stafford by Rhoda, daughter of John Amcotts of Aisthorpe in Lincolnshire, Esq. by Rhoda, daughter of Thomas Hussey of Caythorpe, eldest son of Sir Edward Hussey, 1st Baronet and Elizabeth Anton, daughter of George Anton of Lincoln, and Member of Parliament for Grantham, by Rhoda (d. 11 Oct. 1686), daughter and coheiress of Thomas Chapman, Draper of Soper Lane, London and Wormley, Hertfordshire, who married secondly as his second wife Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron. His mother also had a sister named Rhoda, Dame Rhoda Delves alias Cotes. First period in Italy, courtier Wright and his wife Catherine first visited Venice in December 1758. An encounter there with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu led to an introduction to John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute and his wife Mary, daughter of Lady Mary. The couple apparently had a close marriage. It was observed by Lady Mary, during the time in Venice the two of them comforted each other over the loss of their stillborn child. It put her in mind of the Butes, friends whose company she enjoyed: and Catherine Wright became her correspondent. Wright was from that time on good terms with Lord Bute, who became Prime Minister in 1762, the relationship being described by William Bodham Donne as \\"private friend\\". Wright was a Groom of the Bedchamber to George III from 21 December 1762 to 30 May 1801. He was knighted on 3 July 1766. Second period in Italy Sir James Wright reached Venice as Resident in mid-September 1766. Shortly, by March 1767, Lord Northington, Lord Chancellor under successive Prime Ministers, showed a wish to exert nepotism on Wright's behalf: through his mother's sister Jane Huband, Wright was a nephew-by-marriage to Northington. Northington's demand, of priority for a move to Florence or Naples, disconcerted Horace Mann, Wright's friend who was settled at Florence. Wright tried to smooth matters over. Horace Walpole, Mann's correspondent, at the beginning of April was assuring Mann that he need not fear the intrigues of the \\"old drunken uncle\\" (Northington), given the influence of Mann's patron Henry Seymour Conway. Both the Wrights were afflicted by illness while in Venice: and they spent a period in England, of around two years, from August 1769 to August 1771, during which Robert Richie deputised for Sir James. Wright was created a Baronet on 12 October 1772 for his services as His Majesty’s Resident at Venice. The Wrights left Venice in 1773, and the posting officially terminated in 1774. John Udny (1727–1800), brother of Robert Udny, filled in for Wright, until his successor John Strange arrived. Later life in politics In 1778, Wright became involved in a political furore when he and Dr. Addington, his own and Chatham's physician, engaged in a futile attempt to bring about a political alliance between Bute and Chatham. This incident terminated the friendship with Bute. Residence, collection and estates In about 1770 Wright bought Ray House in Woodford from Bennet Hannot. He later took up residence in the two-storey five-bay brick mansion. Around 1773–6 Robert Adam worked on Ray House for Wright. Here Wright housed a collection of paintings acquired in his time in Venice. He was an art dealer, and made exaggerated claims for the works: a painting now attributed to Palma Vecchio was described by him as a Giorgione. He purchased amongst other works The Finding of Moses by Giambattista Tiepolo (as a Benedetto Caliari) in 1769, on behalf of Lord Bute. The painting of the biblical story is now in the National Gallery of Scotland. His time in Venice had allowed Wright some opportunity to develop as a connoisseur of painting, and he became a patron. He commissioned portraits: from Robert Fagan, Matthew William Peters, Joshua Reynolds, and Johann Zoffany. In the heated crayon debate of British art in the late 18th century, he contributed an opinion. Joseph Farington recorded in 1796 that at a Royal Academy committee meeting: > A letter was read from Sir James Wright stating that 'having observed how > much Crayon painting is fallen off in what he sees at the Exhibitions'. He > offers the Academy a portrait by F. Cotes of Bromfield, the surgeon, as a > lesson to the Students. Allegory by Palma Vecchio, owned by Sir James Wright, now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art Wright founded an artificial slate business on his estate in Woodford, noticed in Environs of London by Daniel Lysons, and mentioned by John Hassell as in a building using such slates. The product was publicised in an anonymous pamphlet of the 1780s, particularly directed towards export to the West Indies. In 1776 Wright went into the business as proprietor by purchasing a patent, from Henry Cook of Norfolk. He refined on the manufacturing process by importing ideas from Italy. Wright also acquired several adjacent estates, including Monkham house and farm. Family James Wright, then of Warwick, was married to Catherine Stapleton (1732–1802), only daughter of Sir William Stapleton, 4th Baronet, on 9 December 1754 at St George's Hanover Square Church, London. The wedding was officiated by Abraham Joseph Rudd, Curate of St. George, Hanover. The witnesses were Sir James Wright's maternal aunt Rhoda Cotes and her third husband William Maddott.James Wright and Catherine Stapleton were married on 9 December 1754 at St. George Hanover Square, London, Westminster, England. James Wright of this Parish, Esqr a Batchelor and Catherine Stapleton, of the Parish of Rotterfield Greys in the County of Oxford, Spinster were Married in this Church by Licence of the ArchBishop of Canterbury this ninth Day of December in the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty Four by me AJRudd Curate of this Parish This Marriage was solemnized between Us James Wright Catherine Stapleton In the Presence of Rhoda Cotes W. Mabbott The Stapletons were slave-owning proprietors of West Indian sugar plantations, and Sir William had died in 1740. A complex legal situation arose after the death in 1746 of his mother, Lady Frances. It was resolved in 1760–1, with Wright receiving a one-eighth share in West Indian property. A corresponding share in the Fountain (Stapletons) estate on St Kitts remained in the Wright family until 1840, when it was sold to Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere. In the period from 1776, the Fountains estate was in practice managed, from England, by Catherine Stapleton (1733–1815), first cousin to Catherine Wright, and close friend of Hester Pitt, Countess of Chatham. In 1788 Wright gave away the bride at the second marriage of Thomas Haweis. She was Jennett Payne Orton, otherwise known as Miss Orton and Janet Payne Orton, a close associate of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon. She is described as the niece of Sir Gillies Payne, 2nd Baronet, of Tempsford Hall, a connection to St Kitts where Payne owned two estates. The acquaintance with Haweis in 1791 drew Wright into unsuccessful negotiations on episcopal ordination of some missionaries hoping to sail on the Second Breadfruit Voyage of William Bligh to Tahiti, with John Moore, now Archbishop of Canterbury. Third period in Italy The Wrights spent further time in Italy during the 1790s. Their son George, an invalid, was there with his tutor, John Ireland, before the latter took up the living of Croydon in 1793. Lady Wright travelled to Italy in 1790, with her son, and Maria Cosway with her brother George Hadfield. Later Sir James came out, with Ireland; and bought more pictures on the trip. Sir George Wright, 2nd Baronet George Wright Their son George Ernest James Wright was baptised on 8 April 1770 at Walcot St. Swithin, Somerset, England.1770 8th [April] George Ernest James the son of Sir James Wright & Catharine His Wife, was baptized [at Walcot St. Swithin, Somerset] Sir James's sister Mary Charleton was his godmother.I give and bequeath to my dear nephew and Godson Sr George Wright Baronet – Will of Mary Charleton, Probate Date: 7 April 1807, Residence: Bristol, Prerogative Court of Canterbury Wills He married Rebecca Maclane (1772Rebecca Catharine Wright, relict of Sir George Wright Bart.

Cantuar. This Marriage was solemnized between Us George Ernest James Wright Rebecca Maclane In the Presence of Wentworth John Bradney (\\"Cantuar\\" is part of the Archbishop of Canterbury's formal signature). At the time of the wedding, the papers reported that Rebecca Maclane was the 'only daughter and heiress to Charles Maclane of Okingham in Berkshire' (Wokingham, in Victorian times the name became corrupted to Oakingham). Far more likely, as other sources note, she was the daughter of Duncan Maclane (d.1773) of the East India Company, gentleman, of Saint John, Hackney, Middlesex, and his wife Rebecca Brandey (d.1792) of Clapham, Surrey at the time she wrote her will. That would make her the Rebecca Maclane that was registered 2 September 1772 in a non- conformist and non-parochial register, born 3 August 1772, the daughter of Duncan Maclane and Rebecca, daughter of Joseph Bradney. A John Bradney was a witness at the wedding of George Wright and Rebecca Maclane. The couple first had one child, Ruperta Maria Wright, born on 21 August 1798, baptised on 1 September 1798 at Saint Mary, St. Marylebone in London, and died on 8 September 1798, buried at St. Marylebone, Westminster, England. Their only surviving child, Ruperta Catherine, married Edward Murray (5 November 1798 – 1 July 1852), Vicar of Northolt, Middlesex, the second son of the Reverend Lord George Murray, Bishop of St. David's, and nephew of the Duke of Atholl, on 14 February 1822. Ray Lodge Wright built Ray Lodge, near Ray House, for George, employing from 1793 as architect John Buonarotti Papworth. Aftermath Lady Wright died at Bath on 6 January 1802. The Wrights had then been living in Bath for some time. Sir James died at Bathford on 8 March 1804. His will was proven on 17 March 1804. In 1807, Sir George Wright sold his Ray House estate to Benjamin Hanson Inglish. On Sir George's death, in or before 1812Will of Sir George Wright, Probate Date: 16 November 1812, Residence: Oakingham, Berkshire, England, Prerogative Court of Canterbury Wills, the baronetcy became extinct (or technically dormant), and the slate business closed down c.1811, while a stone-cutting business for pipes in Dublin managed by George Papworth for Sir George, from 1806, lasted to 1812. Ray House was destroyed by fire in 1838.

A radius from the leak was evacuated, including 90 from the Bible Camp. * 1981 On August 25, in downtown San Francisco, California, a 16-inch natural gas main was punctured by a drill that an excavation contractor was using. Escaping natural gas blew upward and carried into the Embarcadero Complex and other nearby buildings. There was no ignition; however, the gas stream entrained an oil containing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). Fall-out affected an eight-square-block area of the city's financial district covering buildings, cars, trees, pedestrians, police, and firemen. Approximately 30,000 persons were safely evacuated from the area in 45 minutes. No one was killed or seriously injured, although many persons were sprayed with the PCB oil mist. There were delays in shutting down the gas, due to inaccurate diagrams. * 1981 On September 4, a drilling rig, operated by a crew core-drilling for coal, near Belle, West Virginia, punctured a 12-inch gas transmission line. The pipeline was operating at a pressure of 600 psig. The rig operator was injured, the rig and a truck were destroyed, and an estimated volume of 3,433,000 cubic feet of gas was lost. * 1981 On September 15, during routine maintenance, a pipeline exploded and burned between a gas plant and a petroleum plant in Goldsmith, Texas.

He was Governor of Léopoldville Province in the Belgian Congo from 1946 to 1950. Career Léon- Georges Morel was born on 9 April 1892. He joined the colonial service on 26 February 1920 as a territorial administrator 2nd class. He was territorial administrator of Thysville (Cataractes-Sud) when the Kimbanguist movement emerged in Nkamba in 1921. Simon Kimbangu began his healing mission as a prophet in the village of Nkamba on 6 April 1921. Morel wrote of the movement: \\"The concern for peace and public tranquility implicitly requires that it be brought to an end calmly but without delay ...\\". The Belgian authorities were worried that Kimbangu might lead a revolt, and on 6 June 1921 Morel ordered his arrest. He was captured some time after, found guilty of disturbing the public order and sentenced to death. The King intervened and his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment, which he served for 30 years in Elisabethville (Katanga). In 1922 Morel was promoted to territorial administrator 2st class. In 1926 he was appointed principal territorial administrator. In 1928 Morel became deputy district commissioner in Boma (Bas-Congo). From 1932 he was deputy district commissioner under F. De Bok in the urban district of Léopoldville. From 1934 to 1942 Morel was district commissioner in Léopoldville. In September-November 1939 the authorities were informed that the Mission des Noirs (Mission of the Blacks) had been founded in the Bas Congo and Léopoldville. Morel reported that the Vicar Apostolic of Kisantu, Mgr (1885-1964), had told him that Simon Mpadi was the promoter of the new movement, and that the Salvation Army adjutant Henri Becquet denied any influence of the Salvation Army. Morel was governor of Léopoldville Province from 1946 to 1950. He succeeded Marcel Maquet (1891–1964) and was succeeded by Lucien Lardinois (1898–1956).

Incidents  This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * Fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization. * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars. * Liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel). * Releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion. PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post-incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are re-purposed to carry different products.Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986–2001, 2002–2009, and 2010–2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. The following incidents occurred during 1980: * 1980 On January 2, crude oil leaked from a fractured 22-inch pipeline, at a levee crossing, in Berwick, Louisiana. At 9:54 a.m., the crude oil ignited. One person was killed, one person was injured, and six homes were either destroyed, or, damaged. The pipeline's monitoring system failed to detect a loss of over of oil. A defective sleeve weld cause the pipeline to fail. * 1980 On January 30, an 8-inch refined petroleum products pipeline, owned by The Pipelines of Puerto Rico, Inc., was struck and ruptured by a bulldozer, during maintenance work on a nearby waterline, in the Sector Cana of Bayamon, Puerto Rico, about southwest of San Juan. Gasoline from the rupture sprayed downhill, and ran off into a small creek. About 1 1/2 hours later, the gasoline vapors were ignited by an undetermined source and exploded; the subsequent fire killed one person and extensively damaged 25 houses and other property. * 1980 On February 21, an explosion and fire destroyed four stores in a shopping complex and severely damaged an adjoining restaurant in Cordele, Georgia. Of the eight persons who were injured, three died later as a result of their injuries. Property damage was extensive. The NTSB investigation of the accident has revealed that natural gas leaked from a 1-inch steel service line, which had been pulled from a 1-inch compression coupling from a backhoe working in the area, and migrated under a concrete slab floor and into a jewelry store where it was ignited by an unknown source. * 1980 A Colonial Pipeline Dispatcher ignored established procedures for dealing with a pressure surge, causing a double rupture of a 32-inch steel petroleum products pipeline on March 6. One break, where the pipe had been thinned by corrosion in a casing under a road, caused the release of of aviation-grade kerosene adjacent to route 234 near Manassas, Virginia. Before being fully contained, the kerosene had flowed into Bull Run River, and had entered the Occoquan Reservoir, a source of drinking water for several northern Virginia communities. The other break, where a crack in the pipe wall initiated during rail shipment of the pipe from the steel mill finally propagated to failure, caused the release of of No. 2 fuel oil near Locust Grove, a rural area in Orange County, near Fredericksburg, Virginia. Before being fully contained, the fuel oil had flowed into the Rapidan River and then into the Rappahannock River, a source of drinking water for the City of Fredericksburg. * 1980 Sabotage during a labor strike was suspected in a gasoline pipeline explosion in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania on March 7. The following fire burned for about 17 hours. * 1980 On April 16, gasoline at a Williams Companies pipeline terminal in Roseville, Minnesota, sprayed from the fractured cast-iron base of a station booster pump at 72 psig pressure, vaporized, and exploded after it was ignited by the spark of an electric switch in the mainline pump control room downwind of the booster pump. One man was killed, 3 others injured, and extensive damage was done to the terminal. About of petroleum products burned and property damage was estimated at $3 million. * 1980 On May 27, near Cartwright, Louisiana, an anhydrous ammonia pipeline was struck by a bulldozer, which was being used to prepare a well site, and the pipeline ruptured. Over 100 people were evacuated from the area. * 1980 On July 23, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline 30 inch line burst in Clay City, Kentucky, spraying dirt and rocks in the area, damaging 2 homes. There was no fire. * 1980 A road grader ruptured an NGL pipeline in Aurora, Colorado on August 11. Firefighters had barely evacuated residents in the area when the vapors exploded, burning one firefighter. * 1980 On September 3, a Mid-Valley Pipeline Co. line was ruptured by pipeline work, in Cygnet, Ohio. Efforts to contain the crude were unable to prevent some of it from entering the Portage River. * 1980 An oil pipeline ruptured and burned while it was being repaired at an oil storage Terminal in Piney Point, Maryland on September 12, 1980. One worker was killed, and 5 others injured in the fire. * 1980 On October 9, a 2-inch compression coupling located on the upstream side of a gas meter set assembly in the boiler room of the Simon Kenton High School in Independence, Kentucky, pulled out of its connection with a 2-inch gas service line. Natural gas at 165-psig pressure escaped through the 2-inch opening and, seconds later, exploded and burned. A basement wall was blown down, an adjacent classroom was damaged, and one student was killed. About 30 minutes later, a second explosion occurred, which injured 37 persons and extensively damaged the school. The gas main was being uprated at the time. * 1980 A bulldozer digging a ditch for a new pipeline hit a 16-inch crude oil pipeline near San Ysidro, New Mexico on October 22. The operator was fatally burned. * 1980 On November 17, a one-inch connector on a sour gas gathering pipeline broke near Malakoff, Texas. 12 families were evacuated for a time. * 1980 A pipeline carrying naphtha ruptured under a street in Long Beach, California, causing a fire that destroyed one home and damaged several others. Two people were injured. Lack of communication of pipeline valve setups, and pressure relief valves set to open at too high a pressure were identified by the NTSB as causes of the accident. (December 1, 1980) * 1980 A dirt pan machine being used for road construction hit a propane pipeline in Sumner, Georgia on December 10, causing slight injuries to the dirt pan operator. US Highway 82 and a rail line were closed, and several families evacuated until the vapors dispersed. There was no fire. * 1980 On December 22, a pipeline carrying jet fuel ruptured in Las Vegas, Nevada, spilling fuel for 2 hours. Later, the fuel ignited, forcing road closures. One firefighter was overcome by fumes. Between 50,000 and of jet fuel were spilled. Prior construction in the area was suspected of damaging the pipeline. * 1980 A Southern California Edison pipeline ruptured in Carson, California on December 23, spilling about 105,000 gallons of crude oil, with some of it reaching the Dominguez Channel. * 1980 A natural gas pipeline exploded and burned at a gas plant in Ulysses, Kansas on December 28.

She proposed the idea of occupying Alcatraz Island in 1964 and was one of the activists who led the protest for return of the island to Native Americans. She planned the first Occupation of Alcatraz, and the suit to claim the property for the Sioux. Concerned for the health of urban Indians, she conducted a study for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which resulted in her becoming the executive director of the first American Indian Health Center in the Bay area in 1972. Early life and education Belva Dale McKenzie was born on June 27, 1920, on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, in Todd County, South Dakota to Virginia B. (née Barker) and Narcisse McKenzie. Her mother was an enrolled member of the Santee Sioux from Nebraska. Her maternal grandfather, Alfred Barker, was a minister, married to Elizabeth (née Messer). Her father was Lakota and enrolled as a Rosebud Sioux. He died when McKenzie was five years old and after his death, she and her mother lived on various reservations. Her mother worked as a cook at the Cheyenne Agency Boarding School and at Fort Washakie, in Wyoming, later marrying Carl Sneve. McKenzie attended boarding school in Pierre, South Dakota and then attended public school, before graduating from Pine Ridge Boarding School After her graduation, in 1941, McKenzie married Allen Louis Cottier, an Oglala Sioux from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Career Cottier's husband joined the Navy during World War II, and Cottier relocated from South Dakota to Alameda County, California in 1943 with her mother and two daughters. They would later have another daughter. After the passage of the Indian Relocation Act of 1956, Cottier became involved in various programs to improve the lives of urban American Indians and served as secretary of the Sioux Club of the Bay Area. In 1963, when the government announced it was closing the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary and returning Alcatraz Island to the City of San Francisco, Cottier suggested to her husband that they claim the island based on provisions in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. Believing that the treaty provided for lands which had formerly belonged to the Sioux to return to the Sioux if they became surplus property, Cottier and her cousin, Richard McKenzie, began a search for a copy of the treaty. Locating a copy in the Bancroft Library, they contacted attorney Elliott Leighton, who studied it with a team of six researchers for a month and a half. Leighton concluded that the treaty allowed non-reservation Sioux to file settlement claims for unspecified-use government lands. Deciding that Sioux tribal members could claim the island, Allen Cottier, president of the local chapter of the National American Indian Council, led a group of five Sioux men including McKenzie, Martin Martinez, Walter Means, and Garfield Spotted Elk, to stake homestead claims on the island on March 4, 1964. They were accompanied by about 35 other people, including Belva Cottier, and brought food sufficient to last 30 days. After pounding in wooden stakes and calling out their allotment number, each man completed a claim form and gave it to Leighton, who was to mail them to the Bureau of Land Management the following day. Two hours later, the acting warden, Richard J. Willard arrived, and threatened the group with felony charges for trespass. Advised by their lawyer to retreat, the group left after having occupied the island for four hours. Three weeks later, Cottier led the effort to lay claim to the island through the courts. On March 27, McKenzie and other Sioux leaders, filed a legal action to obtain title to the island. In their petition, they asked the government to grant them the property for the purpose of founding a Native American university. The court ruled against them citing a 1934 action by Congress which had revoked permission for Native Americans to claim unused government land. While the government recognized the separate provisions of the 1868 Sioux treaty, the interpretation was that the Sioux had never owned Alcatraz, thus it could not be restored to them. When the government denied the petition, the property was awarded to the General Services Administration, but Cottier's efforts were remembered and served as a catalyst for the 1969 Occupation of Alcatraz. In 1967, Cottier was hired as a volunteer counselor at the Oakland American Indian Association. Her position was initially undefined, but her duties included providing social services and driving Native Americans to appointments. In 1969, she divorced and began working as a paid employee for the Indian Association. That year, she also met with Richard Oakes and advised him and other students as they drafted a plan for a second occupation of Alcatraz. In 1970, the Urban Indian Health Board was founded to address health needs of Native Americans in the San Francisco Bay area. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare granted funds to evaluate indigenous health needs and Cottier conducted a survey of families in Alameda, Santa Clara and San Francisco counties. The study became the basis for establishing a Native American Health Center in San Francisco in 1972 with Cottier serving as its executive director. While predominantly serving the American Indian population in the Bay area, the center was not restricted to Native American patients nor in its service area. During the Wounded Knee Occupation, Cottier collected donations and supplies, ensuring their safe delivery to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Cottier was involved in organizing a conference in 1972 to unite the discussions of needs and the national quest for equality among urban Indians, as well as those living on reservations. The Urban Indian Council which was formed during the conference was opposed by Russell Means and members of the American Indian Movement, but Cottier pressed for a less radical approach to problem solving. She believed the biggest problems facing urban Indians were unemployment and their isolation and invisibility in large cities. In 1975, Cottier married James W Satterfield. She continued working at the Native American Health Center into the 1980s. Death and legacy Cottier died at her home in Livermore, California on May 2, 2000, and was buried on May 9 at the Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, California. She is remembered for her activism on behalf of Native Americans.

Gameplay Carrier Force is a computer wargame that simulates aircraft carrier warfare. Development Carrier Force was the fourth game by designer Gary Grigsby. It was released in 1983, the same year he debuted North Atlantic '86. Reception Tom Cheche reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"CF has been exhaustively researched, and beautifully produced. In many ways it is the kind of game that we had in mind several years ago when we were daydreaming about where the wargaming hobby was headed now that the computer had arrived.\\" In his 1989 survey of computer wargames, J. L. Miller of Computer Play found that the game was \\"hampered by very slow execution\\" and offered it a middling score.

Morrison biographer Clinton Heylin believes that this is the same teenage girl who is idealized in other of Morrison's 1960s songs such as \\"Cyprus Avenue.\\" In this song, the singer can remember when she was \\"the apple of [his] eye\\" but he no longer can see her much as she now lives \\"way up on the avenue of trees.\\" When he now does get a chance to see her he becomes tongue-tied, only able to say \\"oh uh uh uh uh.\\" The music uses a three chord structure and has a Latin music feel, similar to other songs Morrison recorded for Berns. Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald believes that the riff imitates that of Ritchie Valens' hit single \\"La Bamba.\\" Morrison biographer Erik Hage describes the song as incorporating \\"psychedelic fuzz guitar.\\" Morrison also plays harmonica on the song. Reception Rolling Stone Magazine critic Dave Marsh described \\"Ro Ro Rosey\\" as being \\"remarkably erotic in the best blues tradition. On the other hand, Hage describes it as being \\"an unremarkable rocker brimming with sexual double entendres.\\" Greenwald describes it as a \\"fun track\\" but states that it is obvious that Morrison was already capable of writing better ones. Music critic Johnny Rogan describes it as an \\"innocuous rock-blues piece.\\" The song was released as the follow-up single to Morrison's hit \\"Brown Eyed Girl.\\" The b-side of the single was a track that was not included on Blowin' Your Mind called \\"Chick-A-Boom,\\" which Morrison biographer Clinton Heylin disparaged for silly lyrics such as \\"I'm going away but I'm coming back/With a ginger cat/What d'ya think of that.\\" The single version of \\"Ro Ro Rosey\\" differed from the album version by overdubbing female singers. The \\"Ro Ro Rosey\\" single did not replicate the chart success of \\"Brown Eyed Girl.\\" The song has been re-released on many of Morrison's compilation albums, particularly those documenting his Bang Records recording sessions.

It currently focuses on STEM research, computer science, competitive mathematics, speech and debate, and entrepreneurship. They have a reported 15 staff members and 45 volunteers.  Overview  Teach 2 Learn teaches workshops in the form of mini-lessons. In these workshops, there is a strong emphasis on helping students develop genuine passion for the topic matter of that workshop in the hopes that they continue pursuing that passion independently, under the belief that the self-motivation that arises from personal passions leads to greater success academically, personally, and professionally. They are partnered with various schools and organizations including much of the Conroe Independent School District (CISD) (The Woodlands College Park High School, York Junior High, Knox Junior High, McCullough Junior High) and are currently continuing efforts to expand.  History  Teach 2 Learn was founded by a small group of students from The Woodlands College Park High School on June 27, 2018. They were motivated by the observation that in a highly competitive academic environment, many of their peers chose to dedicate their time to certain activities—such as maintaining a good GPA—for the sole purpose of getting into a good college rather than doing something they were passionate about. Due to a lack of intrinsic motivation, many of these peers burned out easily and failed to be admitted to their target colleges. On top of that, by the end of high school many of them still did not have a clear idea of what career path they wanted to pursue after high school because they failed to invest time in exploring their interests. Thus, Teach 2 Learn was born with the mission of helping younger students find career-applicable and academic passions so that, by the time they got to high school, they would not only have a clear vision for their future career path, but be self-motivated to dedicate time to developing their skills in that area rather than exclusively working away at aspects of school that would be unsustainable alone. Prior to 2020, Teach 2 Learn remained confined to the founders personally designing and conducting more loosely formatted workshops in STEM research, computer science, speech and debate, and Destination Imagination at a few CISD schools, with volunteers serving as helping hands on a per-workshop basis. However, in the summer of 2020, they expanded their force of full-time mentors to more than 20, with different mentors specifically assigned to develop the curriculum and teach for a specific workshop series. In July and August of 2020, Teach 2 Learn held summer workshops online via Discord, an online communication platform, with about 250 total students attending over a 5 week time span.

Constructed in Sunderland in 1903 she served as a navigational beacon in the British Isles until the Second World War. From June 1944 she was positioned off Normandy to mark a mineswept shipping lane used for the Operation Overlord landings. After the war she was stationed in the Bristol Channel until sold for scrap in 1973. Saved by the intervention of a scrapyard manager, she has lain on a mud bank in Neath, Wales, ever since. Several proposals have been made to restore her.  Construction  Light Vessel 72 was built for Trinity House, the General Lighthouse Authority for England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar. Constructed in Sunderland by John Crown & Sons in 1903, she had a hull of rivetted iron plates and a wooden deck. The vessel measured in length, in beam, and in depth, and had a gross tonnage of 257. For her role as a navigational aid, a tower in the midships was fitted with a paraffin lamp that could be seen up to away. As a light vessel, she was unpowered, relying on Trinity House tenders to tow her into position where she would anchor.  History  Light Vessel 72 was deployed in service in the British Isles until the Second World War. She was anchored off the Normandy coast on 18 June 1944 as part of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of France. Light Vessel 72 served to mark a mineswept channel on the approach to the British and Canadian landing grounds. For this deployment she was marked with the letters \\"JUNO\\" on her hull, in reference to Juno Beach, part of the Normandy Landings. In this role she was seen by many of the occupants of troop ships carrying British and Canadian forces to France. Another Trinity House vessel, Light Vessel 68, was deployed off the American beaches at a station known as \\"Kansas\\" but was withdrawn to the United Kingdom in November 1944. Light Vessel 72 remained on station until 27 January 1945 when she was withdrawn to Le Havre for repairs to damage caused by storms and collisions. She was placed on a new station, known as \\"Seine\\", in February but was withdrawn to Harwich, England, on 3 March after being replaced by the French light vessel Le Havre. The Allied naval commander Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay recognised the contributions of the light vessels and associated buoys in a dispatch of September 1944 noting that \\"the great success achieved [in the invasion] was due in no small part to the contribution of Trinity House\\". After the war Light Vessel 72 served in the Bristol Channel. She remained in service until sold for scrapping in 1973 to the Steel Supply Company in Neath, Wales. At the time of her sale she was the oldest vessel in the Trinity House fleet. The manager of the Steel Supply Company, Ian Jones, recognised her historic value and refused to break her up. The vessel has sat on a mud bank of the River Neath, adjacent to the scrapyard since. Light Vessel 72 has since deteriorated, some of its hull plates have warped, plants now grow on its deck and some of her brass fittings have been stolen. As one of the last remaining iron vessels she has historic interest and has been added to the National Historic Ships register (number 143). In 2020 it was reported that experts who had surveyed the ship advised that the mud berth has helped to preserve its structure and only minor work would be required to float it. Although visible from a distance the ship is not publicly accessible, the adjacent land being privately owned.  Proposed restoration  Several plans have been put forward for the restoration of the vessel. At one point it was considered for conversion into a night club and at another stage was almost sold to a youth club in Marseille. In 2016 a campaign (\\"Save our Ship of Light\\") was launched to purchase and restore the ship, at an estimated total cost of £100,000, and return it to Sunderland. This was unsuccessful. The owners have indicated their asking price for the vessel is £40,000.

It was founded in 2018 as a spin-off from the MOVE-II CubeSat project and WARR at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The headquarters are in Munich, Germany. Early rendering of the Bus of the Cubesat MOVE-II  History  OroraTech was founded by Thomas Grübler, Björn Stoffers, Florian Mauracher and Rupert Amann. After the idea had been born during the MOVE-II CubeSat project at the TUM, they worked on a spin-off since January 2017 before incorporating the company as Orbital Oracle Technologies GmbH (short: OroraTech) in September 2018. OroraTech’s technology is based on academic research at the TUM, with TUM professors Ulrich Walter, a former astronaut, and Alexander W. Koch acting as advisors to the company. The advisory board further includes Johann G. Goldammer, leader of the United Nations Joint ILO/ECE/FAO Expert Network, and Clemens Kaiser, former Director of Program Development at EUMETSAT, among others. OroraTech has raised a total of €1.377 million from four business angels in a pre-seed (Dec 2018) and seed investment round (Dec 2019) and received further initial funding support by various programs (see #Programs and Achievements).  Product  OroraTech operates a software platform for the detection and monitoring of wildfires based on measuring thermal-infrared radiation from space. The company is using data from existing satellites and develops their own constellation of 3-U CubeSats with thermal-infrared cameras to further improve temporal and spatial resolution of fire detection.  Software Platform  The platform is providing different base maps and overlays for vegetation, fire risk, and weather data. Fire detections are clustered and evaluated for false positive rejection using a learning algorithm. Data on wildfires is also accessible via application programming interface (API). Users can receive customized notifications of fire detections for monitored areas and analyze the propagation of fires with historic data. At the current stage, the platform uses data from twelve satellites in polar and geostationary orbits, including such by NASA, ESA, and EUMETSAT. In early 2020, the platform had around 100 active users.  Satellite Technology  The satellite technology is based on research from the MOVE-II project at the Chair of Astronautics (LRT) at the TUM. During this project, a 1-Unit CubeSat developed by more than 120 students was launched with SpaceX in December 2018. Each of OroraTech’s satellites will be 10 cm x 10 cm x 34 cm in size, weigh around 1.2 kg, and will be launched to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at a height of 600-700 km. OroraTech’s nanosatellites are based on three key innovations: a patented new CubeSat bus which originates in the University research, a patent-pending uncooled thermal- infrared imager for space applications, and a GPU-accelerated on-orbit processing to reduce the downlink latency and bandwidth, cutting down the delay of wildfire alert dissemination.  Programs and Achievements  OroraTech has taken part in several programs: * Google for Startups Accelerator * German Accelerator * ESA Business Incubation * EXIST * Plug and Play Brazil * SME Instrument Phase 1 The company also achieved the 1st prize at the European Student Challenge 2018 of House of Mentors and won the best pitch at the StartUp Night! of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi).

Hernandez Covington who took senior status on July 12, 2020.\\"Eleven Nominations and Three Withdrawals Sent to the Senate\\", White House, September 8, 2020 On September 9, 2020, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee.United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary: Nominations for September 9, 2020 Her nomination is pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The American Bar Association (ABA) rated Mizelle \\"Not Qualified\\" to serve as a federal trial court judge due to the fact that she had less than twelve years of experience as an attorney and the fact that “Since her admission to the bar Ms. Mizelle has not tried a case, civil or criminal, as lead or co-counsel.” According to the ABA, Mizelle had roughly five years of trial experience at the time of her nomination; the ABA typically requires twelve years in order to give a nominee a rating of \\"Qualified\\". The ABA said Mizelle \\"has a very keen intellect, a strong work ethic and an impressive resume ... her integrity and demeanor are not in question.\\" But, the committee wrote, “These attributes...simply do not compensate for the short time she has actually practiced law and her lack of meaningful trial experience.” Personal life Mizelle is married to Chad Mizelle, who is the acting General Counsel to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Life Pierre Nauwelaert was born in Antwerp on 17 March 1903, son of Arcadius Nauwelaert and Marie Blom. He graduated from the Colonial University in 1925. Nauwelaert was appointed a territorial administrator 2nd class in Lusambo District. After a four month internship at the district capital, he was assigned to the Loto territory, which at the time was little known, had little infrastructure and few means of communication. In 1929 he was appointed government delegate to various organizations involved in renovating the Matadi–Léopoldville Railway, a project that lasted from 1923 to 1932 and involved correcting the route and upgrading to standard gauge. This was a difficult task with many problems in providing housing, food and medical care for the laborers, and constant coordination between the different services and groups involved. Nauwelaert was territorial administrator in Mayumbe from 1933 to 1938. In 1939 he was assistant district commissioner in Bas-Congo District, then spent six months in Léopoldville in charge of the indigenous affairs service of Léopoldville Province. He was promoted to district commissioner in 1940, but remained in Léopoldville in charge of the provincial secretariat until 1943, then in charge of the general government's personnel department. He was given charge of the Bas-Congo at the start of 1945. He had to deal with disturbances in Matadi that year, including strikes, destruction of property and imprisonment of Europeans by the rebels. From 1948 Nauwelaert served as provincial commissioner in Coquilhatville, Équateur Province and in Léopoldville Province, and was interim governor in both provinces. He was formally given the title of provincial commissioner on 1 July 1948. He stood in for Luc Breuls de Tiecken in Équateur in 1950, and signed his decrees as Governor of Équateur until Breuls de Tiecken resumed office in 1951. On 1 July 1953 Nauwelaert was made governor of Léopoldville Province, holding office until he retired from the colonial service on 28 February 1955. He succeeded Lucien Lardinois in this office, and was succeeded by Julien Babilon (1904–1959). From 1955 to 1960 he remained in Léopoldville as general representative of the Congolese cotton company (Société cotonnière congolaise), of which he became administrator on 11 July 1960.

Jai Shri Krishna (or Jai Shree Krishna) is a Hindi expression, translating as \\"Glory to Krishna\\" or \\"Victory to Krishna\\", a major deity in Hinduism. The glory expression is believed to have hailed from the Mahajans and Vaishnavites. The expression is said to greet another person wishing them full of success and has also been used as a greeting accompanied with namaste or bowing head, specially while greeting elder ones. Jai Shri Krishna expression is widely used expression to greet people during the Hindu festival of Janmashtmi, which celebrates the birth of Krishna. In present day, Jai Shri Krishna is widely used among the Jain community, Gujataris and Rajasthanis, based in and out of India.  Anecdotes  In one instance in Hindu mythology, when demons failed to kill Krishna, Kansa thought to kill him by inviting him to Mathura. On reaching Mathura, Krishna met with one of Kansa's washerman, requesting for few dresses for his friends who have accompanied him. The soldier on learning that it is Krihna who is infront of him and that he is Kansa's undeclared enemy, tried to kill Krishna assuming he will be rewarded. Looking at the soldier's failed attempt and Krishna's strength, the crowd accumulated in market poured with slogans on Krishna and such as Jai Shri Krishna along with Jai Shri Balram and Jai Shri Vasudev, hence glorifying Krishna's brother and father respectively.

She is an associate professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Early life and education Hersch Nicholas earned her Bachelor of Science degree from Cornell University in 2002 before enrolling at George Washington University for her Master of Public Policy degree in 2004. As a graduate student, she co-published The cost of privatization: extra payments to Medicare Advantage plans with Brian Biles and Barbara S. Cooper. Their study found that people with private Medicare plans will pay 8.4% more on average than fee-for-service costs. Upon receiving her degree, Hersch Nicholas traveled to New York and earned a Master of Philosophy and PhD at Columbia University in 2008. Her completed dissertation Medicare Advantage? Managed Care and Medicare Quality, Cost and Enrollment won the 2009 Heinz Dissertation Award from the National Academy of Social Insurance. Hersch Nicholas completed her National Institute on Aging postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan. Career Upon completing her postdoctoral fellowship, Hersch Nicholas stayed at the University of Michigan (UMich) as a Faculty Affiliate in the Survey Research Center at their Institute for Social Research. In this role, she led a study which found that patients who had completed advance directives were less likely to die in a hospital. In 2013, Hersch Nicholas left UMich to become an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. As an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins, Hersch Nicholas led multiple studies on the benefits and consequences of medicare. She was the lead author of a research paper which indicated that the number of minority patients with Medicare receiving bariatric surgery were declining after the Medicare Center of Excellence Policy was implemented. It was found that the policy unintentionally discriminated against non-white patients. She received the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's 2013 Outstanding Article of the Year Award for her research. The following year, Hersch Nicholas led a study on the quality of care given to elderly Medicare beneficiaries in nursing homes, long-term care facilities, or living at home. Her research team found that elderly patients living on their own, or with family members, who were cognitively impaired were treated more aggressively compared to their counterparts in living facilities. The findings were believed to be the first to \\"estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia at the end-of-life and examine the associated healthcare costs and utilization for community dwellers.\\" In a similar fashion, she worked alongside Justin B. Dimick to lead various studies on quality and care in hospitals. One of such studies worked with an initiative called the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) to conclude that quality reporting in hospitals were not accurate enough to improve their quality of surgical safety or save costs. The study examined 263 hospitals and analyzed data from over 1,000 seniors enrolled in Medicare who had a major operation at those hospitals. Another main research area Hersch Nicholas focused on as an assistant professor was on Medicare fraud, the benefits of marijuana, and out- of-pocket costs. In 2016, Hersch Nicholas co-led a survey-based study on beneficiaries of Medicare who developed cancer and paid out-of-pocket expenditures for their treatments. Her team found that some cancer patients paid as high as 63% out-of-pocket for their treatments. This developed into her later research which focused on Medicare fraud and the reasons behind it. Her team analyzed demographics of patients seen by excluded and non-excluded providers, and found that those excluded were more likely to be minorities, disabled, and dually-enrolled in Medicaid to supplement financial assistance for health care. As a result, these vulnerable populations were more likely to commit Medicare fraud due to their marginalization. In the same year, Hersch Nicholas collaborated with researchers at Temple University to suggest that medical marijuana laws could lead to the overall improvement older adult’s health. In February 2020, Hersch Nicholas was promoted to associate professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management.

His research considers separation-type instrumentation for the rapid analysis of chemical and biological compounds. Kanu is also involved with education and outreach programmes, and works to bring hands-on chemistry lessons to young people in Sierra Leone.  Early life and education  Kanu was the first member of his family to attend university. He attended University of Sierra Leone, where he studied chemistry in Fourah Bay College. He was involved with track and field as an undergraduate student. Kanu was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship, and moved from Sierra Leone to Manchester for his graduate studies. When he arrived at the University of Manchester Kanu started to work on gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. For his doctoral degree he developed miniaturised systems for environmental monitoring. His doctoral research formed the basis of two patents focussing on membrane sampling, which reduced sampling time by 60%.  Research and career  After earning his doctoral degree, Kanu started a postdoctoral fellowship at Washington State University. He worked alongside Herbert H. Hill, Jr. on the development of ion mobility mass spectrometry. He proposed that this work could be used to reduce false positives in airport screening for explosives and drugs. He also showed that it was possible to separate drugs using the drift gas selectivity of ion-mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry. He has applied ion-mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry to identify environmental pollutants in both indoor air and contaminated water. He has created a novel sampling system that incorporates a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane and nanoparticles for one-step sampling, isolation, separation and desorption of environmental pollutants. Alongside his academic research, Kanu works to improve the representation of minority students in science. He leads undergraduate research programmes and supports student chapters of the American Chemical Society and National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers. Kanu leads the annual Extreme Forensic Instrumentation Experience Lab at Winston-Salem State University, which sees high school seniors take part in a research project themed around a crime drama. He works with Chemists Without Borders to introduce young people in Sierra Leone to practical chemistry skills and help to rebuild the education system after the Civil War. As part of this work, Kanu created affordable green chemistry lab kits, which included materials and manuals.

In July 2015, however, cooperation between the two countries was canceled by the government of Brazil.  History  The creation of the company was carried out on October 21, 2003, with the signing of the Long-Term Cooperation Treaty in the Use of the Cyclone-4 Launch Vehicle. Negotiations between Ukraine and Brazil formally started on November 18, 1999, with the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Cooperation of Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. The initial investment for each country was set at US$ 80 million. In March 2009, the Brazilian Government announced an increase in the company's financial capital by R$ 100 million, with R$ 50 million being the responsibility of each of the governments.  Cancellation  On July 16, 2015, Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Veira officially announced the cancellation of the project with the Ukrainian government. The decision was made for reasons of commercial viability, three years after Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff received the diagnosis from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, which pointed out that the project would not generate the projected profits from the commercial launch of satellites from Alcântara Launch Center. The program's initial budget was R$ 1 billion and the Brazilian government invested R$ 500 million in the project. In 2018, the Brazilian government sends Provisional measure 858 to the Brazilian Congress that provides for the extinction of the company, later converted, on April 17, 2019, into Law 13,814.

The only permanent settlements in the valley are Port Renfrew and those of the Pacheedaht First Nation. History The valley has home to the First Nations of Vancouver Island since time immemorial. The First Nations of Vancouver Island have a legend of a Spanish trading schooner which arrived on the Island's southwestern coast in 1777. The Spanish anchored in Port San Juan and traded with the Nitinat Natives. The Spanish discovered gold in the San Juan River and tried to recover the gold. The Nitinat Natives slaughtered the Spanish expedition. Two Spanish women were taken as slaves. The women were later released to another Spanish expedition who discovered them. The later expedition inadvertently infected the Nitinat Natives with smallpox. There is some evidence to support this story. Spanish ships such as the Santiago investigated the west coast in the 1700s. There are also records of attacks on Spanish by First Nations. This is the first alleged discovery of gold in the San Juan River. Geography The San Juan Valley is separated from Cowichan Valley, to the north, by the Seymour Range, and from the Loss Creek and Jordan River valleys, to the south, by an unnamed mountain ridge. The valley is bisected by the San Juan River, which flows west to east and empties into Port San Juan. It also contains three small lakes: Fairy Lake, Lizard Lake, and Pixie Lake. Geology The valley sits on what is the remains of the Pacific Rim Terrane, a terrane which was crushed between the Wrangellia to the north and Siletzia to the south. This terrane extends further west to the Pacific Ocean and further east to Victoria. Climate The western end of the San Juan Valley has an Oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) due to its close proximity to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Further inland the valley is characterized by a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb). Ecology The San Juan Valley hosts a temperate rainforest. The valley lies in a temperate rainforest biome and is home to the coniferous \\"big trees\\" associated with British Columbia's coast – western hemlock, western red cedar, Pacific silver fir, yellow cedar, Douglas fir, grand fir, Sitka spruce, and western white pine. It is also characterised by bigleaf maple, red alder, sword fern, and red huckleberry. The valley is home to some of the largest and oldest remaining patches of old growth forests on Vancouver Island. Trees of note include the Red Creek fir, the largest Douglas fir in the world, and San Juan Spruce, the former second largest Sitka spruce in the world.Knox, Jack. 2010.

The game follows a cat named Kiki attempting to save her owner after they crash land on an alien planet, forcing Kiki to don a mech suit and explore the planet's depths.  Gameplay  In Gato Roboto players control a cat named Kiki. By default, Kiki can climb and jump off of walls, swim in water, and well as fit through small gaps. She is unable to damage enemies or use any other abilities, and dies in one hit. However, while inside of a mech suit (which can be obtained at most save points) she gains multiple hit points, a gun attack, as well as several other upgrades found throughout the game, such as a double jump and a dash ability. Other mechs, including a submarine and a turret, can be found throughout the game. The player's main goal is to enter the lab of the alien planet Kiki is stranded on in order to find a way to free Kiki's owner, Gary. Access to the lab is blocked off until the player clears the planet's aqueducts, heating system, and ventilation system, after doing which they advance to the lab, the final area of the game. Throughout the game's world there are many upgrades, including movement abilities, health upgrades, and cassette tapes which unlock optional color palette swaps for the game's 1-bit graphics.  Plot  In the distant future, Gary and his cat Kiki are piloting a spaceship to a distress call in an alien planet. While flying towards the planet, Kiki steps on the ship's keyboard causing the ship to crash land. Both survive, but Gary is trapped with the wrecked ship, while Kiki is outside of it. Gary then sends Kiki out to find a mech suit, explore the planet, and find a way to get off of it. Throughout the world Kiki can discover voice logs which speak of a mad scientist obsessed with keeping his sickly dog alive. Additionally, as Kiki clears out the planet's systems to gain access to the lab, they repeatedly encounter a talking rat, who is eventually revealed to be the mad scientist, transferred into a different body. He plans to transfer his consciousness into Gary's body, and transfer his dog's consciousness into Kiki's body to save him. After Kiki defeats the scientist, she and the dog escape the planet, leaving the scientist behind.  Reception  Gato Roboto was received favorably by critics, aggregating a score of 79/100 on Metacritic. Kyle LeClair of Hardcore Gamer called it a \\"fun, insane concept\\" and \\"simple yet highly fun\\".

He was deputy governor general of Équateur Province in the Belgian Congo from 1917 to 1919. Later he became a businessman, head of several large enterprises in the Congo, and director of others. He drew criticism for his forced recruitment of Congolese workers in the Kilo-Moto gold mines. Early years (1875–1901) Georges Brunon Joseph Marie Moulaert was born in Bruges, Belgium, on 19 May 1875. His father was a doctor, and the family as well to do. He studied the classics in school, then entered the Royal Military School in 1892. He became a 2nd lieutenant of the engineers on 22 December 1894, based in Antwerp at the Compagnie special des Pontonniers et des torpilleurs (Special pontoon and torpedo boat company). Moulaert became a member of Antwerp's \\"Club africain\\", where he met colonials who had returned to the country. He decided to enter the service of the Congo Free State, and was accepted after an interview with Charles Liebrechts, secretary general of the Interior Department of the Free State. He was seconded to the Military Cartographic Institute, used by the Belgian state to make soldier avalable to King Leopold II's private colony. Three of his brothers also spent time in the Congo, including Julien Moulaert and Maurice Moulaert. Colonial service (1901–1919)=Peacetime service (1901–1914) Moulaert left for the Congo in January 1902 as a lieutenant of the Force Publique. That year he was promoted to captain of the Force Publique. He was assigned to the Fort de Shinkakasa, designed to protect the lower Congo, and completed the work on this structure. During leave in 1905 he drew up plans for additional works related to the fort. During this first tour of duty he also experimented with wireless telegraphy and in 1903 took part in the mission to delimit the border between the Congo Free State and the French Congo in the Manianga (Bas Congo) region. Workers at the Port of Léopoldville c. 1905 In 1905 Moulaert became a colonial civil servant with the rank of interim district commissioner 1st class. He was promoted to district commissioner 1st class in 1908. He became commissioner general in 1910. He was in charge of the Stanley Pool / Moyen Congo District (Léopoldville). He reorganized the urban supply system of Léopoldville and laid the foundations for its subsequent urban development. He developed a new vision for the city layout, organized the \\"indigenous\\" quarter and designed the port. In 1911 he requested that the port of Léopoldville, which was too close to the rapids, be moved upstream to the plain of Kinshasa. This was done twenty years later. Moulaert criticized the Catholic Church's fermes-chapelles (farm chapels), mistreatment of the Congolese, seizure of land and failure to pay taxes. His reports were used by liberals and socialists in Belgium in their campaign against the Catholic Church in the Congo. In addition to his civil service duties, from 1907 to 1915 Moulaert was in charge of the Upper Congo navy. He met Prince Albert in 1909, when the prince was making a long tour of what had just become the Belgian Congo. From 1911 the king's special fund financed several of Moulaert's projects for river traffic, and in later years Moulaert directly requested the king's support. He created what would grow into the beacon service and the hydrographic services. He built up the fleet, equipped the shipyard in Léopoldville and organized the lumber stations. He advocated coordination between different types of transport. This led to the establishment of Sociéte National des Transports Fluviaux au Congo (Sonatra), Union National des Transports Fluviaux (Unatra) and then Office des Transports Coloniaux (OTRACO) in 1935. He was promoted to Commandement du Génie (Commander, Engineers) in 1909. In 1913 Moulaert married Louise Beckers (born 1883), daughter of an engineer. They would have three children. World War I (1914–1918) Baron Dhanis on Lake Tanganyika, 19 January 1916 In May 1914 Moulaert requested a second ten-year term in the colony, which was granted on 1 August 1914, a few days before the start of World War I (1914-1918). As commander of the Upper Congo Navy he organized and directed, from Léopoldville, the Belgian military expedition with the steamer Luxembourg which joined with the French in the Sangha operations in the Kamerun Campaign against the Germans. In December 1914 he asked to be reinstated in the Belgian army so he could fight in Europe, petitioning the king directly, but was refused. In Léopoldville he argued about river and port infrastructure policy with his superior, the acting governor general Eugène Henry, and earned a reprimand. To the east of the colony the Belgians and British were fighting the Germans in German East Africa. In January 1916 Moulaert was given command of a unit on Lake Tanganyika. In April 1916 he was promoted to lieutenant- colonel of the Force publique. He created a slipway and small port near the mouth of the Lukuga River. This was the haven for the small flotilla that won the Battle for Lake Tanganyika, and was the nucleus of the future city of Albertville. Moulaert again became involved in controversy when he fell out with Geoffrey Spicer-Simson, commander of the British forces on the lake, and with his own seniors. Henry even asked the Minister Jules Renkin to dismiss Moulaert, who again asked to serve on the Belgian Front. He left Africa for Europe in March 1917 and took command of the 1st Battalion of the 5th Engineer Regiment of the 5th Army Division. His battalion helped prepare the Houthulst Forest attack in the action of 22 October 1917. Governor of Équateur (1917–1919) On 20 August 1917, while he was serving on the Yser front Moulaert was appointed deputy governor general of the province of Équateur. The governor general and the minister of the colonies had refused to appoint him to head Congo-Kasaï, where he had served in the past. He embarked for the Congo in November 1917. On arrival in Coquilhatville Moulaert visited all the centers of the province and tried to address problems related to administrative organization, development of urban centers and exploitation of natural resources. However, he was frustrated by the central bureaucracy. In 1919 he left the Congo before a meeting of the Government Council, since he did not think provincial governors could achieve anything there. Moulaert was succeeded as deputy governor general by Alphonse Engels (1880–1962). Business career (1920–1958) Two miners in Kilo-Moto c. 1941 At the end of 1919 Louis Franck, the Minister of the Colonies, gave Moulaert responsibility for the state mines at Kilo and Moto. These were located in largely hostile territory, with no communications and very primitive operations. Moulaert tackled improvements to roads, transport, medical support, supplies and crops, as well as mining installations, exploitation of alluvium and eluvium deposits, prospecting and research. Between 1920 and 1924 the company built of roads, with many metal bridges, and installed of telegraph and telephone lines. In 1924 a hydroelectric power station was inaugurated at Soleniana and the grinding plant was electrified. Due to poor transport across the Congo region, particularly the Matadi-Léopoldville Railway, the company developed a route from the Uele River to the Nile to transport cotton, coffee and other products of the region. In 1924 Moulaert returned to Brussels on a visit, and was appointed secretary general of a commission to examining the colony's transport. In 1926 the Régie industrielle des Mines d’Or de Kilo-Moto was converted to a Congolese limited liability company. Moulaert was made chairman of the board. He continued to head the company until 1947. Moulaert boosted gold production at Kilo-Moto, but his methods were questioned, particularly forced recruitment of Black workers, who totaled 10,012 in 1918 and over 40,000 in 1939. An official report drafted by Colonel Alexis Bertrand in 1931 said from 35% to 50% of able bodied adult men were forced to leave their homes to work the gold deposits, far above the official limit of 10% set by the Manpower Commission. This caused public controversy. Moulaert strongly defended \\"his\\" company, but criticism continued into the 1940s. On 5 September 1928 he was a founding director of the Chantier Naval et Industriel du Congo, and remainede a director until 1958. On 1 February 1929 Moulaert was involved in founding the Symaf company, and became chairman of the board. On 29 January 1932 he was one of the founders of Symétain, and on 25 November 1937 became president of Symétain. He remained on the boards of Symaf and Symétain until his death. In 1935 Moulaert visited Kalima, where mining was just starting, and drew up plans for offices, houses, a hospital and workers camps. In the mid-1930s Moulaert obtained the rank of honorary reserve major general in the Belgian army. From 1937 to 1954 Moulaert was administrator of the Crédit Général du Congo, which in November 1948 became the Compagnie Financière Africaine. He held senior management positions in Société Congolaise de Gaz (Sogaz), Usine de textiles Texaf (Utexléo), Filatures et Tissages de Fibres au Congo (Tissaco), Société Commerciale Des Textiles (Socotex), Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce et l’Industrie (CCCI) and Compagnie des Produits et des Frigorifères du Congo. From 1934 to 1938 he was president of the Association des Intérêts coloniaux belges (Association of Belgian Colonial Interests). In the late 1930s Rodolphe Dufour, commissioner of Stanleyville Province, was the target of concerted and virulent attacks from La Belgika and the Kilo-Moto Gold Mines delivered by their influential representatives André Gilson, also president of the Association of Belgian Colonial Interests, and by Moulaert. They claimed that Dufour failed to support colonial interests and caused great damage as a result. Moulaert was a founding member of the Royal Colonial Institute (later the Royal Academy of Overseas Sciences), and became president of the institute in 1943. He died in Brussels on 17 September 1958.

It served in Anti-Aircraft Command defending the West of England until almost the end of the war, when it was converted back into an infantry battalion for occupation duties in North West Europe. Postwar it served on in the air defence role until the disbandment of AA Command in 1955. Origin In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of Territorial Army (TA) infantry battalions into searchlight (S/L) units. The 1st Battalion, Monmouthshire Regiment, was one unit selected for this role, becoming 1st (Rifle) Battalion, The Monmouthshire Regiment (68th Searchlight Regiment) on 1 November 1938. The battalion, which dated back to 1860 and had served with distinction as pioneers during World War I, was based at Stow Hill, Newport, Wales, and reorganised for its new role with Headquarters (HQ), 453, 454 and 455 S/L Companies.Monthly Army List, May 1939.Frederick, pp. 171–2.Frederick, pp. 860–1, 872.Litchfield, pp. 181–2. It formed part of 45th Anti-Aircraft Brigade, which was responsible for the AA defences of South Wales. Initially the brigade was under 4th Anti-Aircraft Division; it was due to transfer to 5th AA Division, but this was still in the process of formation when war broke out on 3 September 1939.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. World War II=Mobilisation and Phoney War 90 cm 'Projector Anti-Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Hampshire. At the time the regiment was formed, the TA's AA units were in a state of mobilisation because of the Munich crisis, although they were soon stood down. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. Some redeployment took place during the Phoney War period. On 30 September the regiment was ordered to begin transferring from 45th to 46th AA Brigade, which was responsible for the 'Bristol Defended Area', including Avonmouth Docks and various aircraft factories. In the near-total absence of light AA (LAA) guns, detachments from other units were deployed with Lewis guns (LGs) during October and November to cover various airfields and aircraft factories designated as Vulnerable Points (VPs). Searchlight detachments were routinely equipped with LGs for local defence, and so in November 68th S/L Rgt took over 16 LGs at Parnall Aircraft, Yate, previously manned by a heavy AA unit. On 8 December 454 S/L Co arrived in 46th Bde's area with Company HQ at Tetbury, followed by the other two companies, but as there was no equipment available for them to operate they continued their training with a few S/L sets. 454 Company was temporarily detached to 35th AA Bde in the Portsmouth area until May 1940.46 AA Bde War Diary 1939–40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2287. In early 1940 most of the S/L units handed over their LAA responsibilities at VPs to specialist LAA units, but when 453 S/L Company left Yate in April it moved to the Rotol Airscrews factory at Cheltenham to relieve an LAA unit that was going to training camp. Similarly, in mid-March, a newly-formed 474 S/L Battery moved into the Tetbury area and took over the S/L sites and equipment from 455 S/L Company, which went to training camp. This independent battery came under the orders of 68th S/L Rgt, but within a month it had moved on into Hampshire.474 S/L Bty War Diary, 1940–41, TNA file WO 166/3322. Battle of Britain As the Phoney War ended with the German invasion of the Low Countries in May, followed by the British Expeditionary Force's evacuation from Dunkirk, AA Command went on invasion alert and 454 and 455 S/L Companies returned to the regiment from Portsmouth. All S/L detachments were warned to be ready to counter-attack any German paratroops landing in their area. 68th Searchlight Rgt sent a detachment to take up ground defence duties at RAF Tangmere, and 455 Company moved to Weyhill, Hampshire, in July. Most of the combats during the early part of the Battle of Britain were in daylight, but Luftwaffe night bombers regularly appeared over the Bristol Defended Area and the S/Ls in South West England were frequently in action. In July 5th AA Bde was reformed in the Gloucester area in 5th AA Division after its evacuation from Dunkirk, and 68th S/L Rgt was among the units assigned to it. On 1 August 1940 all the infantry battalions that had converted to AA roles became regiments of the Royal Artillery (RA) and from that date ceased to be part of the corps of their parent regiments. Their companies were henceforward termed batteries. Although the personnel retained their 1st Monmouths cap badges, worn with RA collar badges, 68th Searchlight Regiment, RA, did not regain its 'Monmouthshire Regiment' subtitle until 18 February 1942.Farndale, Annex M. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 232nd S/L Training Rgt at Devizes where it provided the basis for a new 525 S/L Bty formed on 14 November 1940. This battery later joined 82nd S/L Rgt. Blitz In November 1940 AA Command changed its S/L layouts to clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced apart. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or Royal Air Force (RAF) Night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with Searchlight Control radar (SLC) and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.Farndale, p. 107.Routledge, pp. 388-9, 393. In November 1940, as the Luftwaffe 's night bombing campaign against British cities (The Blitz) was getting under way, there was a major reorganisation of AA Command. 5 AA Division's responsibilities were split, with 9 AA Division created to cover the South Midlands and South Wales. 5 AA Brigade came under this new formation, with responsibility for covering Gloucester and Hereford.Farndale, Annex D.Routledge, p. 394.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Pile's despatch. There were few air raids in 5 AA Bde's area, although the defence of the aircraft factories still caused concern after the Gloster Aircraft Company works at Hucclecote were targeted in February. In March 1941 68th Searchlight Rgt was ordered to strip some Lewis guns from its S/L clusters and send them back to Parnall's at Yate.46 AA Bde War Diary 1941, TNA file WO 166/2288.Air Raid on Gloster Aircraft Company at BBC WW2 People's War. Mid-war 8th AA Division's formation sign. By May 1941, 68th S/L Rgt had reverted to the command of 46 AA Bde in the Bristol area, now under 8th AA Division. When 46 AA Bde was split to form 69 AA Bde in July 1941, 68th S/L Rgt came under the new formation, which took command of the S/L regiments. 68th Searchlight Rgt remained with 69 AA Bde for the next two years.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, TNA file WO 212/83.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84.Frederick, p. 1051. b In September 1941 AA Command began to receive its first purpose-built SLC radar in sufficient numbers to allow the sites to be 'declustered' into single-light sites spaced at intervals in 'Indicator Belts', 'Killer Belts' cooperating with night-fighters, and with the HAA guns of the Gun Defence Areas such as Bristol.Routledge, pp. 99, 399. 150 cm Searchlight fitted with No. 2 Mk VI SLC radar After its defeat in the Blitz, the Luftwaffe carried out few night raids over the UK until early 1942 when it began a series of attacks (the so-called Baedeker Blitz) against open cities. Bath, Somerset, was one such target (the Bath Blitz of April 1942), which spilled over onto Bristol and led to some redeployments in 8th AA Division's area.Collier, Chapter XX.Collier, Appendix XXXVII.Routledge, pp. 400–4.46 AA Bde War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7403. There was a shake-up of AA Command at the beginning of October 1942, when the AA Divisions were replaced by AA Groups having a wider remit. 69 AA Brigade and 68th S/L Rgt came under 3 AA Group. The regiment returned to the command of 46 AA Bde in March 1943.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. Luftwaffe penetrations of the Bristol area were now rare, though a number occurred in March 1944 at the time of the 'Little Blitz'.Collier, Chapter XXI.46 AA Bde War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 166/14659.Routledge, pp. 409–10. 609 (Monmouthshire) Infantry Regiment, RA As the threat of attack by the weakened Luftwaffe waned, AA Command was forced to release manpower for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). In June 1944 the War Office (WO) warned AA Command that it would have to provide further reinforcements to 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe. The run-down began in the autumn, when most AA defences in the West of England were dismantled, and on 13 September 1944 68th S/L Rgt was instructed to un-man all its operational sites and concentrate the personnel at Bristol. This was followed by an order for the regiment to lapse into suspended animation on 25 September.Routledge, pp. 420–1. Meanwhile, 21st Army Group's manpower crisis deepened, particularly among the infantry and the WO began reorganising surplus AA regiments in the UK into infantry battalions for duties in the rear areas.Ellis, pp. 141–2. On 1 November the order for 68th S/L Rgt to lapse was cancelled and instead it was converted into 68th (Monmouthshire Regiment) Garrison Regiment, RA, on 4 November.Frederick, pp. 879, 881. Soon afterwards it joined 21st Army Group.Ellis, Appendix IV.Joslen, p. 463. In January 1945, the War Office accelerated the conversion of surplus artillery into infantry units for line of communication and occupation duties, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380. On 13 February 1945, the regiment was redesignated 609 (Monmouthshire Regiment) Regiment. RA. The regiment finally entered suspended animation in April 1946. Postwar AA Command's formation sign. When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947 the regiment reformed at Newport as 603 (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (1st (Rifle) Battalion, The Monmouthshire Regiment), ('Mixed' indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit).Frederick, p. 1025.592–638 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. The regiment formed part of 71 AA Bde (the prewar 45 AA Bde) based at Cardiff.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Routledge, Table LXXIV, p. 441.Watson, TA 1947. When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 there were wholesale amalgamations amongst the TA's AA units. 603 (M) HAA Rgt became P (1 Monmouth) Bty in 283 (Monmouthshire) Field Rgt.266–288 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. On 1 May 1961 283 Fd Rgt amalgamated with 281 (Glamorgan Yeomanry) Fd Rgt and 282 (Welsh) HAA Rgt to become 282 (Glamorganshire & Monmouthshire) Fd Rgt, in which P Bty became R (1 Monmouth) Bty.Frederick, p. 1001.Litchfield, p. 80 When the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) in 1967, the combined regiment became 211 (South Wales) Bty in 104 Light Air Defence Rgt, with D (Monmouthshire) Trp at Newport. Frederick, p. 1040. Uniforms and insignia After World War II, 603 (M) HAA Rgt continued to wear the distinctive silver or white metal cap badge of the 1st (Rifle) Bn, Monmouths, together with the Royal Artillery's collar badges. In addition, the buttons and non-commissioned officers' chevrons were black, to denote the unit's ancestry as a Rifle battalion.

Kennedy, who tried cases in 36 states, was a member of the National Lawyers Guild and the State Bar in California and in New York. A trial lawyer for over 50 years, Kennedy was known as a tireless fighter for justice and an exceptional legal strategist who was a \\"steadfast defender of the underdog and the First Amendment.\\" Kennedy represented an array of individuals and groups connected to an era marked by struggle for justice, human rights and equity in the United States and abroad. Kennedy, who specialized in civil and criminal litigation and complex negotiations, was a guest teacher of trial advocacy at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York City. His clients included Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panther Party; Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground; Cesar Chavez, co-founder of the United Farm Workers; leading advocate for the use of LSD Timothy Leary; members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA); Los Siete de la Raza; and Pablo Guzmán of the Young Lords. While staff at the NECLC Kennedy defended members of the Fort Hood 43 and the late Stanley Neptune, a member of the Penobscot Nation and protester at Wounded Knee. Kennedy obtained clemency for Jean Harris in 1993. He represented former Sicilian Mafia don Gaetano Badalamenti in the Pizza Connection drug-smuggling case, and Ivana Trump in her contentious divorce with Donald Trump. Biography=Early years Born in Spokane, Washington to Thomas Kennedy and Evelyn (née) Forbes, Kennedy was sent to a Jesuit boarding school when he was four years of age where he remained for over a decade. After high school, Kennedy earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962, then a Juris Doctor from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, California. After receiving his law degree, Kennedy joined a private law firm and began a career as a defense attorney, often pro bono, in many of the country's well-known civil rights cases. Time in the US Army In 1964, Kennedy was First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army where he was often disciplined for making anti-war speeches while in uniform. At an officers' dinner, Kennedy met Eleanora, the woman who would become his life partner. Once he returned to private life, Kennedy's law practice focused on representing draft resistors, conscientious objectors as well as marginalized people and underrepresented groups seeking social justice. Film poster for SXSW 2020 documentary by director William Kirkley about Kennedy's life, work and political activism he shared with his wife Eleanora. Courtesy of Kennedy family and film director. Legal career Kennedy's specialty was jury trial work with emphasis on constitutional defenses, including human and civil rights. In the First Amendment area, he was regarded as an authority on the laws of libel and tax fraud defense. Kennedy was considered one of the nation's leading authorities on search and seizure law and the emerging area of privacy rights arising out of the Fourth and Ninth amendments. He also tried many cases involving constitutional issues raised by constitutional due process clauses and Sixth Amendment fair trial concerns and right to counsel. He litigated many constitutional issues by Writ of Habeas Corpus. Kennedy was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Court of Appeals for the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and District of Columbia Circuits. He was also admitted to a number of United States District Courts. Kennedy, and colleague Michael Tigar, put on many provocative programs for the Litigation Section of the American Bar Association (ABA), including a death penalty case at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, an Israeli/Palestinian mock arbitration about sovereignty and human rights in Gaza and the West Bank,Francis A. Boyle, Palestine, Palestinians and International Law, Clarity Press, Inc. September 2006 and a much-heralded international tribunal investigating war crimes in Bosnia.Bland, Mark A. (1994) \\"An Analysis of the United Nations International Tribunal to Adjudicate War Crimes Committed in the Former Yugoslavia: Parallels, Problems, Prospects,\\" Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies: Vol. 2 : Iss. 1 , Article 15. Personal life Michael Kennedy was married to Eleanora (née Baratelli) Kennedy for over four decades. Together they have a daughter, Anna Kennedy. Kennedy also has two children from a former marriage: Lisa Marie Kennedy and Scott Hamilton Kennedy, an Academy Award nominated documentary film director. Kennedy and Eleanora lived in New York City for many years and spent summers in a legendary ocean-front mansion known as \\"Kilkare,\\" located in Wainscott, Long Island. They spent winter months in a cottage in West Palm Beach, Florida and spent long vacations at their stone house in Ireland. Notable civil rights cases and clients Michael Kennedy played a central role in the nationwide protests against the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. A new breed of radical attorneys were emerging on the legal scene, which included Kennedy and other contemporaries such as Charles Garry, Michael Tigar, William Kunstler, Michael Ratner, Leonard Boudin, Michael Standard, Victor Rabinowitz, and Charles Nesson who worked on pro bono cases as often as not. Kennedy moved to New York in the late 1960s to take the position of staff counsel of the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, which until 1968 was known as the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee. 1960sUnited Farm Workers and Cesar Chavez= Working on behalf of the NECLC Kennedy represented labor leader Cesar Chavez, who along with Dolores Huerta, co-founded the mostly Latino National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), which was later renamed as United Farm Workers. Kennedy defended Chavez and migrant farm workers in their protest against exorbitant rents and subpar living conditions. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy got involved in the successful 1965 strike against the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P;) for selling non-union grapes and lettuce. The five-year boycott, which became known as the Delano grape strike, prompted an international boycott of grapes. The strike, initially organized by the predominantly Filipino AFL–CIO-affiliated Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, led to the creation of the United Farm Workers of America, the first union representing farm workers in the United States. =Fort Hood 43= A group of African American GIs who recently returned from Vietnam were ordered to serve on riot-control duty at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois where protests were anticipated in response to the recent assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.. The servicemen refused to serve and were consequently court-martialed. Kennedy successfully represented the group, which became known as the Fort Hood 43. One of Kennedy's clients, the decorated Sgt. Robert D. Rucker, later became an attorney then went on to become the second African American to serve as Judge on the Illinois Supreme Court and the first African American to serve on the Indiana Court of Appeals. = The 1968 Democratic Convention and The Chicago Seven= The Chicago Seven were charged with conspiracy to incite riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. While defending Rennie Davis, Kennedy and three other lawyers - Gerald B. Lefcourt, Michael Tigar and Dennis Roberts - were briefly jailed for contempt of court by presiding Judge Julius Hoffman. Some thirty attorneys in San Francisco protested Hoffman's punitive decision by burning their Bar Association cards on the steps of the federal building. By the end of the five-month trial, referred to as one of the \\"most bizarre courtroom spectacles in U.S. history\\" by the Washington Post, Judge Hoffman had issued over 200 citations for contempt of court against the defendants and their attorneys. All seven defendants - Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, and Lee Weiner - were acquitted on riot conspiracy charges, though found guilty of intent to riot. =House Un-American Activities Committee= :Main article: House Un- American Activities Committee Shortly after the 1968 Democratic Convention, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Dave Dellinger and Robert Greenblatt received subpoenas to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Michael Kennedy was among the group's six defense attorneys. The HUAC hearings were viewed by the NECLC as an \\"attempt by the Johnson administration to use every mechanism at its disposal to legitimize the action of Mayor [Richard) Daley and the Chicago police,\\" and the violence they displayed against protesters during the 1968 DNC. Daley had ordered the entire Chicago police force of 12,000 men to work 12-hour shifts and called in over 5,000 National Guardsmen in addition to some 1,000 Secret Service and FBI agents who were also on duty. On the opening day of the HUAC hearings, the subpoenaed men and their lawyers, including Kennedy and William Kunstler, staged a \\"stand-in\\" to protest the investigations. \\"The Constitution is being raped and we as lawyers are being emasculated in an armed camp,\\" Kennedy shouted at the hearing.Jonah Raskin, For the Hell of It: The Life and Times of Abbie Hoffman, University of California Press; First edition (May 28, 1998) =Los Siete de la Raza= :Main article: Los Siete de la Raza Michael Kennedy, along with co-counsel Charles Garry, defended a group of seven young Hispanic men in San Francisco's Mission District who, while moving a television set into a friend's home in May 1969, were stopped by two plain clothes policemen and asked for their ID cards. An altercation ensued between the young men and police officers Joseph Brodnik and Paul McGoran. In the scuffle, a gun was fired, killing one of the police officers. According to a New York Times account of the shooting, \\"about the only evidence that is not disputed is that the bullet that killed the policeman, Patrolman Joseph Brodnik, was fired from the gun of his partner, Patrolman Paul McGoran, at a distance of about two inches.\\" During the scuffle, McGoran called the youths \\"wetbacks.\\"Joshua Bloom, Waldo E. Martin, Jr., Waldo E. Martin Black Against Empire: The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party, Publisher University of California Press; First Edition, October 25, 2016 pg. 288 It was revealed during the much publicized trial that Brodnik had harassed the same young men previously, had 38 counts of police brutality and 4 counts of brandishing a gun in past skirmishes, and was known as a racist. Kennedy and the other defense attorneys proved that Brodnik's partner Paul McGoran had accidentally fired the shot that killed him. After the stormy four-month trial, which had become a cause célèbre in the Latin-American community and the New Left, the young men - Gary Lescallett, Rodolfo Antonio Martinez, Mario Martinez, Jose Rios, Nelson Rodriguez, and Danilo Melendez - were acquitted and freed. The seventh defendant, George Lopez, was never apprehended. =Columbia University protests of 1968= :Main article: Columbia University protests of 1968 Kennedy represented Columbia Law students who tried to shut down the law school in protest of the Vietnam War. Disciplinary hearings were held to expel them. Kennedy represented the students, including Gus Reichbach and Eleanor Stein, who were charged with violating campus rules. Ultimately, charges were dismissed. Stein and Reichbach both went on to become attorneys, then judges. =1960s gay liberation movement= The Committee for Homosexual Freedom (CHF) was a gay and lesbian rights organization founded in San Francisco in April 1969 by gay activists Leo E. Laurence and Gayle Whittington. Both were fired by their employers (respectively, ABC Radio and freight company, State Steamship Line) after a photo of them embracing was published by the countercultural newspaper the Berkeley Barb. Laurence said he was fired by ABC for his \\"radical politics, revolutionary writings, and strong union activities.\\" Kennedy defended Laurence's case on the basis of what Laurence referred to as \\"ABC's unwritten discrimination against homosexuals; an attack on freedom of speech and press.\\" 1970s Kennedy defended numerous conscientious objectors and draft resistors at the height of the Vietnam War. Some draft protesters chose prison over fighting in what they regarded as an immoral and unjust war. Others opted to go to Canada where they were welcomed. Vietnam deserters got as far as Sweden, to where Kennedy traveled to represent persons sought for extradition by the United States. =Andy Stapp and Dennis Ciesielski= Kennedy defended Andy Stapp, an anti- war activist who had formed the American Servicemen's Union, an unofficial union for US military members who opposed the Vietnam War. In 1968 Kennedy tried the case of Dennis Ciesielski, the first US sailor to refuse orders to serve in Vietnam. Ciesielski, charged with desertion, was convicted of a lesser offense. =The Buffalo Nine= :Main article: Buffalo Nine The Buffalo Nine comprised a group of students associated with State University of New York at Buffalo who sought sanctuary in a Unitarian Universalist church in Buffalo, New York. When US Marshals, FBI agents and the Buffalo Police stormed the church with blackjacks, Bruce Beyer - leader of the Buffalo Draft Resistance Union - was arrested along with eight others for evading the draft and assaulting an officer. Their arrest drew national attention.Mark Goldman, \\"High Hopes: The Rise and Decline of Buffalo, New York\\" State University of New York Press, June 30, 1984 Kennedy, then staff counsel with the NECLC, along with former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark, represented members of the group that became known as Buffalo Nine. Beyer, who faced considerable jail time, jumped bail and fled to Canada then eventually made his way to Sweden, where he was granted humanitarian asylum. =Fort Hood and US Army marijuana possession case= :See also: G.I. Coffeehouses The United States military reported that at the height of the Vietnam War, over half of all troops on tour in Vietnam were consuming marijuana. Many didn't stop after they came home. Returning soldiers smoked so much cannabis that the Texas military post, Fort Hood, became known as \\"Fort Head.\\" Michael Kennedy's first marijuana case, also the first of its kind in the U.S. military, involved Pfc. Bruce \\"Gypsy\\" Peterson who opposed the war on humanitarian grounds and started an underground GI newspaper Fatigue Press at Fort Hood.Jerry Lembcke, \\"The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory, and the Legacy of Vietnam,\\" NYU Press (May 1, 2000) Peterson also organized anti-war protests for soldiers and civilians. In 1968, while leaving a GI coffee house in Killeen, Texas, local police arrested Peterson on suspicion of drug possession. They turned him over to military authorities at Fort Hood who found such a miniscule amount of marijuana in the lint of his pockets that it was destroyed in the process of analyzing it. Still, Peterson was convicted and sentenced to eight years of hard labor at the Leavenworth military prison. After Peterson served two years, Kennedy, working with the NECLC, got involved in Peterson's appeal. Kennedy managed to get Peterson's conviction overturned on the grounds that the search was illegal, due process had been violated, and that an 8-year sentence for an immeasurable amount of cannabis residue was cruel and unusual punishment. Peterson's case was not only Kennedy's first pot case, but also the first marijuana prosecution case in the history of the U.S. military.Melvin Small, William D. Hoover, \\"Give Peace a Chance: Exploring the Vietnam Anti-War Movement,\\" Syracuse University Press; 1 edition (July 1, 1992) =Puerto Rican Vietnam War draft resisters= In the first case of its kind in San Juan, Puerto Rico's Federal Court, Kennedy represented Edwin Feliciano Grafals, a self-described, non-religious conscientious objector, who was studying math and science at the university when he was drafted into the US military. A member of the Movimiento Pro-Independencia de Puerto Rico (MPI), Grafals objected to being drafted and condemned American aggression in Vietnam. Grafals and other Puerto Ricans took issue with forced induction into the U.S. Armed Forces, arguing that Puerto Ricans had no allegiance to, nor received any benefits from, the United States. As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico has no US voting rights, no representation in the US Congress and is not entitled to electoral votes in presidential elections. Kennedy, at the time a teacher at Rutgers Law School, moved to Puerto Rico with his wife Eleanora Kennedy to represent Grafals and to train Puerto Rican attorneys in the event there was another similar anti-draft case. However, the Grafals case, for which two U.S. prosecutors were appointed and flown to Puerto Rico, was the last of its kind. Ultimately, presiding Judge Hiram Rafael Cancio ruled in favor of Kennedy's client. Judge Cancio noted in his opinion, issued on January 23, 1970, with regard to Grafals: \\"You believe, for the same reasons, with the same conviction and just as honestly, that the Military Selective Service Act is not constitutional nor valid, insofar as it applies to Puerto Ricans, who were not represented with a voice and vote in the legislative body which approved it. Your conscience does not permit you to serve compulsorily in the United States Armed Forces, regardless of how justified or unjustified are the wars this nation is engaged in.\\" =H. Bruce Franklin, Freedom of Speech, Stanford University and William Shockley= H. Bruce Franklin, a Stanford professor, renowned Herman Melville scholar and outspoken critic of the Vietnam War was fired from Stanford University in 1972 for allegedly urging protestors to riot, \\"resist police efforts\\" and to make \\"people's war\\" against the university.Donald Kennedy, Academic Duty, Harvard University Press. March 15, 1999 Stanford University's president and advisory board had proposed dismissal. But Franklin, a self-proclaimed revolutionary with a sizable campus movement behind him, elected to have a public hearing. He chose Michael Kennedy as his counsel. Franklin and Kennedy argued that the professor's actions involved constitutionally protected free speech but the university prevailed and recommended serious penalty, short of dismissal. At that time, the ACLU got involved and took Franklin's case into the courts where, after eight years of decision and appeal, the case was decided in the university's favor. =William Shockley on race and eugenics challenged= Dr. William B. Shockley of Stanford University, a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics and considered by colleagues to be a genius,J. Shurkin, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age, Palgrave Macmillan; 2nd ed. 2006 edition (June 13, 2006) evoked controversy and considerable hostility for his insistent views that blacks were genetically inferior to whites and scored lower on intelligence quotient tests as a result of heredity. He also opined that people on welfare should be sterilized. Shockley's views prompted not only Stanford students but students around the country to protest his lectures. In January 1972, a group of approximately 16 Stanford students and non-students entered his classroom where he was giving a quiz. The students challenged him to a debate. Shockley declined and called campus police who removed the students who were later expelled by Stanford University authorities. Kennedy represented several of the students in court but ultimately the university prevailed. The students, some of whom were months from graduating, remained expelled and Shockley continued teaching at Stanford though his lecture circuit was deeply curtailed as hundreds of students and individuals around the country showed up to protest his racist views. =Timothy Leary= Timothy Leary, former Harvard University psychologist known for his exploration of psychedelic drugs and being referred to as the \\"most dangerous man in America\\" by President Richard Nixon, was arrested in 1970 for possession of two cannabis joints. He was sentenced to 10 years and imprisoned in the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo, California. Leary hired Kennedy to appeal his sentence. When the appeal was rejected, allegedly Kennedy planned to break Leary out of prison with the help of the Weather Underground and the Brotherhood of Eternal Love. Once Leary was free, he fled to Algiers where Eldridge Cleaver and the Black Panther Party received him for a short time until he made his way to Switzerland and then Afghanistan where he was captured in 1973 and returned to the United States.Bryan Burrough. Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence. Penguin Books; Reprint edition April 5, 2016 When investigated by the FBI, Leary accused Kennedy of masterminding his prison escape. As a result, Kennedy faced disbarment, but the FBI was unable to prove Leary's accusations and the charges against Kennedy were eventually dropped.Lisa Rein, \\"Interview with Timothy Leary Archivist Michael Horowitz\\", August 30, 2017 =Michael Randall of the Brotherhood of Eternal Love and the Orange Sunshine LSD= Kennedy represented Michael Randall, co-founder of the Brotherhood of Eternal Love. One of the Brotherhood's utopian plans was to cheaply mass produce LSD and distribute it to everyone who wanted it. To make \\"so much Orange Sunshine that it would become virtually free. We had a deep spiritual commitment to what we were doing,\\" Randall said.Benjamin Ramm, \\"The LSD Cult that Terrified America\\", WWW.BBC.Com, January 12, 2017 =Bernadine Dohrn= Among the original members of the Weather Underground, classified by the FBI as a domestic terrorist group, was Bernardine Dohrn who went into hiding in 1969. She was subsequently placed on the FBI's Most Wanted List when she jumped bail after being charged with two counts of aggravated battery, stemming from the Days of Rage and other protests. After 11 years on the run with her husband Bill Ayers and their three sons, Dohrn resurfaced with the assistance of Michael Kennedy and his wife Eleanora Kennedy who helped plan Dohrn and her family's safe return to open society. Once she turned herself in, Dohrn was called to testify before the Grand Jury against ex-Weatherman Susan Rosenberg. Dohrn refused and was held in contempt of a grand jury and served 7 months in prison. =The Mitchell Brothers: Behind the Green Door= The Mitchell brothers, Jim and Artie Mitchell, owners of pornography and strip clubs in California from 1969 until 1991, produced and directed many adult films, including Behind the Green Door in 1972. The film starred the legendary adult movie actress, Marilyn Chambers, who started her career as the wholesome model on Ivory Snow detergent boxes in the early 1970s. Behind the Green Door played to regular crowds in the Mitchell brothers' club, the O'Farrell Theater in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco, until Jim Farrell was arrested for production and exhibition of \\"obscene material.\\" The Mitchell brothers hired Kennedy to defend them against the obscenity charges. Kennedy utilized the First Amendment to successfully defend the brothers who continued to show their films, even while being arrested dozens of times over the coming year.Gary Kamiya, \\"Officer's '66 killing of black teen sparked Hunters Point riots\\" San Francisco Chronicle, September 16, 2016 =Murder of Artie Mitchell and trial= In 1992, Kennedy defended Jim Mitchell in San Francisco on the charge of murdering his brother, Artie. The trial involved some of the most modern and sophisticated technology, including the first use of 3D computer animation, in a criminal case. Mitchell was found not guilty of the murder charge. He was convicted of a lesser charge of manslaughter. =Black Panther Party, Huey Newton mistrial= Kennedy defended Black Panther Party leader Huey P. Newton, who was accused of killing a 17-year-old prostitute in August 1974. The trial ended in a mistrial with the jurors deadlocked 10 to 2 for acquittal. Newton was also accused of assaulting a tailor. Newton, a revolutionary political activist, along with fellow Merritt College student Bobby Seale, founded the Black Panther Party in 1966 in the wake of assassination of black nationalist Malcolm X and the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen named Matthew Johnson by the police in San Francisco. The police shooting of Johnson sparked the Hunters Point Uprising. 1980s–1990sThe Pizza Connection= The so-called Pizza Connection Trial, a criminal trial against Sicilian and American Mafias, was centered on a number of independently owned pizza parlors in New York that were allegedly being used as fronts for trafficking heroin from Southwest Asia to the United States. Michael Kennedy represented Gaetano Badalamenti, who was a capofamiglia (crime boss) in his hometown Cinisi, Sicily and former top boss of the Sicilian Mafia. The trial, the longest in the judicial history of the United States, lasted from September 30, 1985, to March 2, 1987, ending with 17 convictions handed down on June 22, 1987. The prosecutor in the Pizza Connection case was Rudolph Giuliani. Badalamenti, known as capo dei capi (boss of all bosses), was considered one of the most-wanted fugitives in the world until his arrest in Madrid in 1984, after which he was extradited to the United States.James B. Jacob, Busting the Mob: The United States v Cosa Nostra, NYU Press, October 1, 1996 Following his conviction in 1987, Badalamenti was sent to prison then later to the Federal Medical Center in Ayer, Massachusetts where he died in May 2004. =Irish Republican Army gunrunners= When five Irish men in New York were charged with conspiring to smuggle weapons to the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Michael Kennedy and a team of six attorneys, including renowned Irish-American lawyer Frank Durkan, won an acquittal for them in Federal Court in Brooklyn, New York on Nov. 5, 1982. The legal team's defense showed that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been involved in the IRA gunrunning operation for a period of years. This defense was presented to the jury when one of the main IRA weapons suppliers, George de Meo, formerly regarded as trustworthy by the IRA, was found out to be an undercover CIA agent. With a license to legally export weapons, the CIA was aiding the IRA's gun running operation in order to monitor the flow of arms to Ireland and prevent the IRA from turning to the Soviet Union for weapons, Kennedy's legal team argued. The jury agreed. The jury agreed. All five IRA defendants, George Harrison, Michael Flannery, Thomas Falvey, Patrick Mullin, and Daniel Gormley were acquitted and walked free after the 7-week trial.Shana Alexander, \\"The Patriot Game,\\" New York Magazine, Nov. 22, 1982 The CIA had remained silent about the gun running scheme until 2017 when declassified information was uncovered by freedom of information campaigners that showed the accusations to be true. A lawsuit against the CIA finally culminated in the agency releasing the archive, which had previously only been accessible at the through the National Archives and Records Administration =Iran–Contra affair= Michael Kennedy being arrested at the New York City Federal Building in 1985 while protesting the US involvement with the Contras When convicted Iran-Contra conspirator Richard Secord brought a $36 million libel suit against Leslie Cockburn and Andrew Cockburn for their book, \\"Out of Control,\\" the Cockburns hired Kennedy. After two years of court battles, Kennedy got Secord's libel lawsuit dismissed. =Jean S. Harris= In January 1993, Kennedy won clemency for Jean S. Harris, who was convicted for the murder of her ex-lover Herman Tarnower, a well-known cardiologist and author of The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet. =Waco Whistleblower= Kennedy represented former assistant U.S. Attorney William Johnston, the so- called Waco whistle-blower, who sparked a probe into whether the federal government was responsible for the deaths of 74 Branch Davidians during the 1993 siege of their compound near Waco, Texas. Johnston had been indicted and charged with two counts of obstruction of justice and three counts of lying to investigators and a federal grand jury. =Dr. Mousa Abu Marzook – Palestine= Gaza-born Dr. Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, a legal resident of the United States since 1982 and whose four out of six children are American- born citizens, was arrested at New York's JFK airport in July 1995. Never charged with a crime in the United States, Abu Marzook, a member of the Hamas Political Bureau and a US educated industrial engineer, was detained on the basis that Israel had sought his extradition on what turned out to be spurious allegations of terrorism, which were never proven. Though his incarceration and detention were illegal in that he had broken no U.S. laws, Abu Marzook was held in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center for two years. Noting that Abu Marzook's constitutional right to a speedy trial had long since lapsed, Kennedy contacted the Israeli authorities on his client's behalf, stating that Abu Marzook was prepared to travel immediately to Israel to stand trial. Israel declined and withdrew its bid to extradite Abu Marzook. \\"Essentially, he called their bluff and said: 'You want me? Take me,'\\" Kennedy said. \\"And Israel said, 'we don't want you.'\\" Kennedy noted that Israel had a weak case against Abu Marzook because it was based on statements by a Palestinian who subsequently recanted, saying he had been tortured by Israeli interrogators and was forced to sign a confession in Hebrew, a language he did not understand. Israel, Kennedy noted, also acted out of fear that it would lose a high-profile case. Once Israel suspended Abu Marzook's extradition request, the United States found itself in a difficult position regarding Abu Marzook who admittedly did not present a national security risk and had broken no U.S. laws. Kennedy worked out a deal with Jordan's King Hussein to receive Abu Marzook on humanitarian grounds. =Susan McDougal – Whitewater= In 1996, Susan McDougal was arrested for refusing to give evidence to the Whitewater Special Counsel brought by independent counsel Ken Starr. When McDougal refused to testify against her business partner at the time, former President Bill Clinton then governor of Arkansas, she was incarcerated in a solitary cell for much of her 18 months of confinement until Kennedy helped secure her release in June 1998. =Nicaragua and the Sandinistas= Kennedy opposed American intervention in Nicaragua and US military and financial support for the Contras who were fighting to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government. Kennedy was a legal advisor, friend, and supporter of the Sandinistas and the Nicaraguan people. Kennedy was arrested and jailed in New York on several occasions while protesting against the U.S. funded Contra war against the Sandinistas. =Nicaragua vs. U.S. - International Court of Justice= Kennedy served as a legal advisor in Nicaragua's successful court case, The Republic of Nicaragua v. The United States of America, which was heard in 1986 before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ruling Sandinista government had accused the United States of violating international law by supporting the Contras' violent actions against their government, which included mining Nicaragua's ports. The ICJ ruled that U.S. support for the Contras was illegal, and demanded that the United States pay reparations to the Nicaraguan government. The ICJ stated in its verdict that US training and financing of the anti-Sandinista Contras, the October 1983 attack on Puerto Sandino and interference with maritime commerce constituted breaches of international law. =Northern Ireland Peace Accords= Kennedy was involved in encouraging US government officials and other influential individuals to travel to Northern Ireland during peace negotiations with the British government that ultimately resulted in the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) on April 10, 1998. Also known as the Belfast Agreement, the GFA was ratified in both Ireland and Northern Ireland by popular vote on May 22 1998. The GFA helped end more than 30 years of armed conflict known as The Troubles. Kennedy and his wife Eleanora took the former US Senator Robert Torricelli and Bianca Jagger to Belfast, Northern Ireland where they met, among other stakeholders, Gerry Adams, then one of the leaders of the Irish Republican Army and later president of its political wing Sinn Féin. =United Nations= Kennedy and wife Eleanora served as special advisors to the 2008-2009 United Nations General Assembly President, Father Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann, who was the former Nicaraguan Foreign Minister. Kennedy also advised the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Influence in American cannabis culture As a proponent of decriminalizing and legalizing cannabis, Michael Kennedy was influential in raising awareness around marijuana's medical benefits as well as its benign effects as compared to alcohol and other drugs. High Times Magazine – The War on Drugs Kennedy served as the General Counsel and Chairman of the Board for High Times Magazine for over 40 years until his death when his wife and board member, Eleanora Kennedy, took the reins. During their four decades at High Times following the death of its founder Tom Forçade in 1978, the Kennedys and the magazine's staff consistently struggled against marijuana prohibition laws and fought to keep the magazine alive and publishing in an anti-cannabis atmosphere. The magazine's former associate publisher, Rick Cusick, said the only way High Times managed to stay in business and never miss a publication date for over four decades was \\"Really, really good lawyers even though everybody knew I was talking about just one - Michael Kennedy.\\"Chris Simunek, \\"Requiem For a Dragonslayer, Michael Kennedy, 1937-2016\\" High Times Magazine, January 26, 2016 The Kennedys, High Times magazine and its staff were supporters of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) since the organization's founding by attorney Keith Stroup in 1970. Kennedy and Stroup maintained a lifelong friendship, connected by their struggle to legalize marijuana and end the War on drugs. Pot prisoners In 2012, Kennedy, his law partner David C. Holland, former High Times editor-in-chief Chris Simunek and Beth Curtis, founder of the website lifeforpot.com, initiated a project to convince US authorities to spare five elderly, non-violent marijuana prisoners \\"the indignity of dying in prison for the supposed crime of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to the citizens of the United States of America.\\" Kennedy and Holland wrote the petition and presented it to President Barack Obama for executive clemency on behalf of the five men. As of mid-2020, four of the five elderly \\"pot prisoners\\" had been released, with the exception of John Knock. Rescheduling cannabis – The White Paper In November 2014, Kennedy and Jon Gettman, former director of NORML and Coalition for Rescheduling Cannabis, co-wrote a widely distributed article titled \\"Let it grow - the open market solution to marijuana control\\" presenting the case for \\"legalizing marijuana by way of a wide-open commercial, competitive market including the allowance of small-scale cultivation for personal use.\\"Jon Gettman & Michael Kennedy, \\"Let it grow—the open market solution to marijuana control\\" Harm Reduction Journal, November 18, 2014Eleonora Kennedy introducing Tom Morello, who presented Bernadine Dohrn with the 2019 Michael Kennedy Social Justice Award Legacy and media appearances=NORML's Michael J. Kennedy Social Justice Award The Michael J. Kennedy Social Justice Award was set up by NORML with the blessing of his wife Eleanora and daughter Anna Kennedy. The first recipient of the award in May 2016 was long-time NORML activist and criminal defense attorney Gerald H. Goldstein, The 2018 award went to longtime Kennedy friend and colleague, Michael E. Tigar, acclaimed litigator and renowned constitutional lawyer. In 2019, the Award went to activist Bernardine Dohrn and was presented by rock star Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine. Recipient of the Michael J. Kennedy Social Justice Award will be given to the late Dr. Lester Grinspoon (June 24, 1928 – June 25, 2020). A Harvard Medical School psychiatrist and associate professor, Dr. Grinspoon became a leading proponent of cannabis legalization after his research found that it was less toxic and less addictive than alcohol or tobacco. Kennedy, along with eleven of New York's top civil rights lawyers, put on Twelve Angry Men to raise money for Legal Aid attorneys. Film and media appearances Along with eleven of New York's most powerful attorneys, Kennedy performed in a production of Twelve Angry Men as a benefit to raise scholarship funds for Legal Aid attorneys. The production was directed by Toni Kotite. In 2016, film director William A. Kirkley made Orange Sunshine a documentary about the Brotherhood of Eternal Love that portrays Michael Kennedy in his role as the group's attorney. Kirkley later made another documentary, Radical Love, about Kennedy's personal and political life, which was scheduled to premiere at South by Southwest in 2020 until the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of the festival. When making the 1990 film, Presumed Innocent, director Alan J. Pakula needed a professional for actor Raúl Juliá to speak with and observe as an experienced trial lawyer, Michael Kennedy was selected. Michael Kennedy's papers and documents are stored at the New York Public Library's Archives and Manuscripts.

In 1867 the name was changed again, to Newton Place United Presbyterian Church. In 1900, with further unions between church denominations, the congregation became a parish of the United Free Church of Scotland, renamed Newton Place United Free Church. In 1929, the congregation officially joined the established Church of Scotland, becoming Newton Place Parish Church.\\"Newton Place United Presbyterian Church\\", The Glasgow Story. Retrieved on 12 August 2020. In 1977, the Presbytery of Glasgow decided to merge three congregations in the Partick area to form Partick South, whilst retaining the use of the Newton Place building. The union took place in 1978, and these included the congregations of Newton Place, Partick Anderson and Hamilton Crescent. \\"St. Mary's Church\\", The Glasgow Story. Retrieved on 12 August 2020.

It is made up of three essays: \\"Nature\\" and the \\"Utility of Religion\\", were both written between 1850 and 1858, while \\"Theism\\" was composed between 1868 and 1870. The book is critical of traditional religious views, instead advocating for a \\"religion of humanity\\".  Essays = \\"Nature\\"  In this essay, Mill argues the idea that the morality of an action can be judged by whether it is natural or unnatural. He then lays out the two main conceptions of \\"nature\\", the first being \\"the entire system of things\\" and the second being \\"things as they would be, apart from human intervention\\". Mill argues that neither definition implies that nature can be a source of moral guidance.  \\"Utility of Religion\\"  This essay contends that supernatural religion has an advantage of non-supernatural religion, in that it provides people with the hope that life continues after death. Despite this, Mill is suspicious of people taking advantage of those who seek to survive their deaths.  \\"Theism\\"  In the book's final essay, Mill explores a number of arguments for the existence of God, using a methodology based on evidence. He argues that religion should be \\"reviewed as a strictly scientific question\\" and should be tested in the same way that other questions in science are examined. Based on his approach, Mill argues that monotheism is better than polytheism, although this does not necessarily mean that monotheism is more correct.

He is a member of the green political party GroenLinks. After receiving an engineering degree, Van den Nieuwenhuijzen started working in the construction sector. He served as a member of the Eindhoven municipal council between 2010 and 2016, a period during which he was named Mister Gay Netherlands. He subsequently worked as an alderman for the municipality Son en Breugel until 2019. He was appointed member of the House in 2020. During his political career, Van den Nieuwenhuijzen has focussed on sustainability and the acceptance of the LGBT community.  Early life and education  Van den Nieuwenhuijzen was born in Weert in the Dutch province Limburg on July 18, 1982. His mother worked as a secretary, while his father was not employed due to a disability. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen attended a high school belonging to the Philips van Horne Scholengemeenschap in that city between 1994 and 1999, earning a diploma. Subsequently, he went to Franklin Pierce High School in the American state Washington for one year. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen studied architectural engineering at Avans University of Applied Sciences in Tilburg (2000–2005). During his adolescence, he was a member of the Youth Organisation Freedom and Democracy, the VVD's independent youth division. While having a job, Van den Nieuwenhuijzen studied business administration at Leergang Bedrijfskunde in Maastricht (2008–2010). He also received a Master of Science degree in business administration from Nyenrode Business University in 2017 after two years of study.  Non-political career  While studying, Van den Nieuwenhuijzen worked as a junior youth participation policy adviser at social work organization Kuseema (2003–2005). He subsequently became a drafter at the Oisterwijk architecture firm Drijvers. He started working in 2006 at Betonson, a company producing concrete, where he held the position of sustainability and energy account manager. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen left his job in 2010 to become the first CSR and sustainability manager at Betonson's parent company, Van Nieuwpoort Groep. Under his leadership, the company developed cement-free concrete, and four of its subsidiaries received a level 3 out of 5 certification on climate bureau HIER's achievement ladder. However, all four companies would lose this certification in 2013. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen stopped working for Van Nieuwpoort in 2012. He taught management and sustainability at Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Tilburg between 2013 and 2018. Simultaneously, he ran a sustainability consulting and project management company called \\"Avengers Way\\". After resigning as alderman in early 2019, he was hired by the municipality Amsterdam to work as a project manager on its climate accord. He left that position when he became an MP.  Local politics = Eindhoven municipal council (2010–2016)  During the 2010 municipal elections, Van den Nieuwenhuijzen was second on the party list of GroenLinks in Eindhoven. He was elected councilman with 257 votes, while his party received four out of 45 seats. He kept working at Betonson and was chosen political talent of 2010 in the Eindhoven \\"Council Member of the Year\\" election. In October 2012, it was announced that Eindhoven would host the pride parade Pink Saturday in 2014. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen had been chairing a committee since 2010 to bring the event to the city. An earlier bid for the 2013 edition had been unsuccessful. In the run-up to Pink Saturday, he announced that he had received an anonymous threat in his mailbox, saying \\"filthy faggot, fuck off with your illness and Pink Saturday\\". Van den Nieuwenhuijzen filed a criminal complaint. In 2013, he was voted Council Member of the Year. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen was re-elected in 2014, when GroenLinks retained its four seats. He had run for GroenLinks in Eindhoven, but did not win. He was also 32nd on the party list of GroenLinks in North Brabant during the 2015 provincial elections. In September of that year, he won the last edition of the beauty pageant Mister Gay Netherlands. He had before participated in the 2007 edition. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen passed the opportunity to take part in the Mr Gay World pageant because of other commitments. He became a member of a committee to chose the new mayor in early 2016. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen left the municipal council in May 2016 to become alderman.  Alderman (2016–2019)  He became alderman in Son en Breugel of, among other things, finances, culture, and sustainability on May 12, 2016 as part of a new executive board. The previous coalition had collapsed halfway through its term. In the executive board, Van den Nieuwenhuijzen represented GroenLinks as well as the Labour Party (PvdA), as both parties work together in Son en Breugel politics. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen wrote a letter in 2016 asking all Dutch municipalities to hang rainbow flags on Coming Out Day. Over 160 out of 390 of them complied compared to about 80 the previous year. He remained alderman after the 2018 municipal elections, because PvdA/GroenLinks became part of the new coalition. His responsibilities included sustainability and citizen participation. During the 2018 elections, he was also on place 28 on GroenLinks' party list in Utrecht. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen resigned from his position in January 2019. According to a statement, he was unable to have an impact on the things in politics that mattered most to him. A number of his proposals to improve the environment had been rejected by the other coalition partners in the preceding months. His plan to decrease the sewerage charges for inhabitants who do not connect their downpipe to the sewers was passed by the municipal council a month after his resignation.  House of Representatives (2020–present)  He was on place 20 on GroenLinks' party list during the 2017 general election, receiving 1,413 preferential votes. His party won 14 seats, not enough for Van den Nieuwenhuijzen to be elected. When MP Isabelle Diks vacated her seat to take a job as alderwoman in Groningen, he was chosen to succeed her because of his position on the party list. Van den Nieuwenhuijzen was inaugurated on May 7, 2020. His portfolio includes development aid and defense.

He also chaired the non-profit CSR organization \\"De MVO-Wijzer\\", that assists small and medium-sized enterprises, from 2013 to 2014.  Personal life  Van den Nieuwenhuijzen is openly gay, and he got married in 2008. He has been living in the city Utrecht since at least 2017, and he lived in Eindhoven before that. In 2008, he crashed into a tree while on his mountain bike. He took a leave of absence from the Eindhoven municipal council in 2015 due to complications from the accident.

In the 1860s she designed pots to which Édouard Manet then added floral motifs. During the Franco-Prussian War in the following decade, she and her husband worked in a temporary hospital set up in her studio. She died in Paris on 20 December 1899 and was buried there in the family grave at the cimetière de Montmartre. She left several of her father's works to Dordrecht Museum, which also houses a number of her own works. Some of her works are also now in the Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam.

(stamped in Osaka) Countermarked yen refers to Japanese trade dollars and 1 yen coins that are stamped , literally meaning \\"silver\\". The countermark was added by the Japanese government in 1897 to these coins dated up to that point. This came at a time when Japan went onto the gold standard prompting the government to confine these two denominations for use outside the mainland. History In 1871, a new coinage law was promulgated which helped with the final establishment of the gold standard system in Japan. However, the process wound up stalled as the Mexican dollar at the time was the universal median of exchange. The Japanese government eventually came to the conclusion that the best interest of foreign trade was to issue silver one yen coins alongside standard gold coins. Silver one yen coins were first struck in 1871 for the mainland before being switched over for use outside of Japan in 1874. Trade silver dollars (also referred to as \\"Boyeki ichi yen gin\\") were first struck in 1875 and were legal tender only within the limits of the trade treaty ports. These trade dollars were only produced until 1877 before being discontinued in 1878. Japan had officially switched to a bimetallic standard which made one yen silver coins legal tender throughout the country. The Japanese government officially recalled and demonetized all silver one yen pieces and Trade Dollars in 1897. Trade dollars in particular were recalled as their silver content was now greater than the competing Mexican Dollar. Many of these two types of coins were melted down to provide bullion for the production of subsidiary coins. Those that were not melted were either kept away by the public or sent overseas for trade. At least 20 million former Trade Dollars and 1 Yen coins were countermarked in 1897 with the character \\"Gin\\" for use in Japanese-occupied Taiwan, Korea, and Lüshunkou.Krause, Chester L. and Mishler, Clifford: 1996 Standard Catalog of World Coins (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, ), p. 1370. The mark was put in place by the Japanese mints at Osaka and Tokyo to identify these coins as simply bullion. Those that were stamped on the left originated from Osaka, while those on the right were from Tokyo. By placing this mark the Japanese government prevented these coins from being sold back to them at a later date for gold. Silver one yen coins would not be stuck again until 1901, when they served as a reserve fund for \\"Bank of Formosa\\" notes. Collecting Countermarked yen are not considered damaged as the marks were placed officially by a government entity. Marks that were placed in Tokyo on the right side of the coin are significantly rarer than those from Osaka. The overall value of these coins may be marginally affected depending on individual collector preferences.

She was the mistress of Juan Domingo Peron, President of Argentina, during the early 1950s. Early Life Nelida Haydee Rivas was born on April 21, 1939, at the Rawson hospital in Buenos Aires, the only daughter of José María Rivas and María Sebastiana Viva. Rivas was a worker at the Noel confectionery factory and his wife worked as a caretaker in an apartment building. Encounter with Peron As a teenager, she participated in the activities organized in the UES or Union of Secondary Students (female branch), a Peronist organization in which high school students met in the Presidential Residence at Olivos. At this time she met President Peron and became linked sentimentally, and sexually, with the Argentine president between the years 1953-1955, after the death of Evita Perón At the time they first met she was either 13 or 14 years of age.Ella tenía 14, él 60: el testimonio de la joven que fue amante de PerónEl relato de la \\"amante\\" de 14 años de Juan Domingo Perón, Nelly Rivas This is how Nelly described her first face to face with Juan Domingo Perón. Nelly told Zavala, according to what he says in his book. Though much of Argentina's media had, since 1950, been either controlled or monitored by the administration, lurid pieces on his ongoing relationship with an underage girl, something Perón never denied, filled the gossip pages. Pressed by reporters on whether his supposed new paramour was, as the magazines claimed, thirteen years of age, the fifty-nine-year-old Perón responded that he was \\"not superstitious.\\" Life after Peron When Perón was overthrown in September 1955, she was arrested with her family in the province of Chaco. During the military government calling itself the \\"Revolución Libertadora\\" (Liberating Revolution), her parents were convicted and confined in the Villa Devoto Prison, while Nelly was transferred to a Correctional Asylum for Minors. The letters she exchanged with Perón were officially published in 1957 by a newspaper in the United States, while Perón was prosecuted for rape, a crime that occurs when an adult maintains a consensual relationship with a minor under 15 years of age (she was 14 when he started the relationship). This prosecution was prescribed in 1971 whilst Perón was negotiating with the de facto president Alejandro Agustín Lanusse the legalization of the Partido Justicialista. Nelly married in 1958 and, in 1973, she reunited with Perón when he returned for his third presidency. Nelly at that time had two children. She died on the 28th of August 2012 at the age of 73.

Completed in 1956, they marked the refinement of Mies’ highrise building design concept. The buildings boast a strong Modernist International style that was considered to be a shocking departure from the dominant aesthetic at the time they were built, and even criticized as too minimal. But the “glass houses” are more often appreciated for the spectacular views they offer of Lake Michigan and downtown Chicago, and the ease with which they blend nature into city life. The buildings were referred to as “giant mirrors for lake beauty”.Chicago American,Giant Mirrors for Lake Beauty, 1955-30-15, Herbert Greenwald The developer of the buildings, Herbert Greenwald, worked with Mies for roughly a decade on several residential highrise projects that preceded and followed 900/910 including Mies’ first skyscraper, the Promontory Apartments, located south in Hyde Park, and the sister buildings to the southeast, 860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments. Like 860 880, 900 910 is built on a 21-foot grid, and located 21 feet west of the west column centerline of 880. Greenwald was a fan of modernist architecture and design. After attending the University of Chicago, he was eager to find an architect who could partner with him on real estate projects along the Chicago lakeshore. Walter Gropius, who had appointed Mies to replace him as Head of the Bauhaus before immigrating to the United States, again recommended him for the job. Mies was selected among the three top architects at the time including Le Corbusier and the other most notable Chicago great, Frank Loyd Wright. Greenwald once said “I’m going to build Mies buildings from New York to San Francisco”.Chicago Architects Oral History Project Interview with Joseph Fujikawa , 1995, The Art Institute of Chicago Department of Architecture. However, in 1959 he died suddenly at age 44 along with 64 other passengers in the epic plane crash, American Airlines Flight 320. Thus, he was unable to witness the final execution of some project collaborations with Mies that were partially built or underway. 900/910 was his last fully completed project. The Curtain Wall The curtain wall perfected at 900/910 is among the most notable of Mies’ design elements, and he reproduced it repeatedly in all of his highrise building designs thereafter. The curtain appears as an uninterrupted sheet of glass that stands apart from the buildings’ structural skeleton as a separate, continuous element. The curtain wall was first conceived in the designs for the Promontory Apartments, but went unrealized due to a steel shortage. At 860-880 Lake Shore, Mies managed to achieve the look of the curtain wall, but–with the windows attached to the structure rather than the mullions–it wasn’t fully realized as a curtain wall. Finally, at 900/910 Mies finally created an autonomous aluminum and glass skin. The skin is reinforced by concrete columns at the lower stories, steel columns in the upper stories, and covered with prefabricated aluminum frame placed outside the structural frame.Impressions of Mies: An Interview with Mies van der Rohe, His Early Chicago Years 1938-1958 with William Shell, Edward Duckett and Joseph Fujikawa. Art Institute of Chicago Ryerson Library archives (Chicago) Mullions are recessed so the windows–taller than they are wide–are uniform in size and achieve a ratio perfectly pleasing to the naked eye. The glass skin in front of the columns allows the buildings to be protected from temperature fluctuations. Heating and air conditioning systems were installed in the space between the concrete columns and skin mullions. Thus, the buildings were deemed technologically advanced and in keeping with the American Zeitgeist. They were also the tallest concrete buildings in Chicago at the time they were constructed, and the first with a flat-slab concrete frame. Mies in America Having immigrated from Europe in the midst of World War II, Chicago became the center of Mies van der Rohe’s life’s work, where by far the majority of his buildings were designed and reside. Oft cited for his “rational” approach to building design, Mies’ architectural philosophy began with articulating a vision, then determining how to make it feasible from an engineering standpoint. The son of a stonemason, Mies was ever attentive to materials. Certainly, his discovery–and the abundance of–steel in Chicago defined his expression of modernism from then on The Verdi marble in the lobby at 900/910 gives the building an aura of lasting elegance. It is thought that the particular climate of the United States at which Mies arrived provided the ideal fertile ground for him to develop his ideas. He was brought to Chicago upon offer of a stable position at the Armour Institute (which later became Illinois Institute of Technology), where he not only acted as head of the architecture school but designed the campus, including the famous Crown Hall. He had the freedom to pursue his professional projects, often recruiting his best students to join him in his practice. Joseph Fujikawa One of those students was Joseph Fujikawa. While the 900/910 building design was distinctly Miesian, Fujikawa can be credited for managing the project and meticulously overlooking details in its execution so that it accomplished its original vision. During the detailing of 900 910, Mies was frequently in New York City working on his famed Seagram building. Thus, Fujikawa worked alongside Herbert Greenwald, as architectural overseer of the project. After Greenwald died, Fujikawa continued to manage the completion of all his projects. Fujikawa’s relationship with Mies began when he was a student at the IIT School of Architecture. After joining the army for a year, he returned to work for Mies’ then 4 or 5-person firm as an associate.Chicago Architects Oral History Project Interview with Joseph Fujikawa , 1995, The Art Institute of Chicago Department of Architecture. At the time, the firm wasn’t highly profitable but Mies kept his staff on, eventually growing the firm to about 35 people. In Fujikawa’s retelling of his experience working with Mies as a student, Mies was warm and attentive–quite unlike the stoic and unfeeling persona that is often attributed to him. Fujikawa believed Mies to be mostly shy and liked his buildings to speak for him, rather than to speak on his own behalf.Chicago Architects Oral History Project Interview with Joseph Fujikawa , 1995, The Art Institute of Chicago Department of Architecture. He often joined his students from IIT for dinner after class at Marx’s on Adams street, where they particularly liked the lambchop. Architecture Community Mies was notoriously private. It is believed that the primarily reason he never lived in any of his own buildings was to avoid inevitable chitchat and questions about the buildings from other residents sharing the elevator. However, the buildings were home to many architects and designers over the years. Several partners and associates from the architecture firm, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill lived in 900/910. SOM took over the IIT commission when Mies retired and readily imitated the aesthetic of his highrise building designs. Many members of the tightknit architecture community lived at 900/910 over the years. Mies’ direct colleagues and collaborators like Walter Peterhans; his wife Brigitte Peterhans (who worked for SOM) and Mies’ own grandson, Dirk Lohan, all occupied the buildings at one time. Lohan became one of the three partners to take over Mies’ firm over upon his retirement along with Fujikawa and Bruno Conterato. Other notable residents include architects Margaret McCurry, who has written about her experience living at 900 910, and Stanley Tigerman of Tigerman McCurry Architects, and Mies’ longtime romantic partner, sculptor Lora Marx. The Bauhaus Mies acted as the last director of the Bauhaus art school in Germany before it was entirely disbanded by the Nazi party. For that reason, and because his own style had such a strong influence on the architects who studied with him or were inspired by his work, he is frequently referred to as Bauhaus. However, he didn’t particularly identify his own style as Bauhaus. He did reassemble some of his former colleagues from the Bauhaus by securing them faculty positions at IIT, including Walter Peterhans, Ludwig Hilberseimer, and John Barney Rodgers.

He did reassemble some of his former colleagues from the Bauhaus by securing them faculty positions at IIT, including Walter Peterhans, Ludwig Hilberseimer, and John Barney Rodgers. At the same time Mies came to Chicago so did another former leader of the Bauhaus and favorite of Gropius, László Moholy-Nagy, to open an eclectic and multidisciplinary design school. Much to Mies’ chagrin, Moholy named it The New Bauhaus. It was later renamed the Institute of Design and absorbed into IIT. There is much adversarial discord on record between Mies and Moholy. Mies viewed Moholy as an embodiment of “frivolous experimentation” that he disliked most about the Bauhaus. The Esplanade 900 910 has colloquially been referred to as the Esplanade Apartments, for which there are several possible reasons. Early drawings of the buildings were labeled the “Esplanade Apartments” and they were marketed as such in later years with the name appearing in collateral and on signage. Some drawings labeled as such were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art and remain part of the museum’s permanent Mies van der Rohe archives.Museum of Modern Art.MoMa.org , Retrieved 2020-08-12 Lastly, the unique sundeck between the two buildings on top of the parking structure is sometimes referred to as the Esplanade. The sundeck has served multiple purposes over the decades since 900/910 were built, offering residents a meeting place for evening cocktails and views of the Navy Pier fireworks. Some recall a playground was once there, enjoyed by the children of residents such as Bob Bell, famous for his portrayal of Bozo the Clown. 900 910 and Art Like many of Mies’ buildings, 900 910 has become something of a museum. A Richard Hunt cor-ten steel sculpture “Fox Box Hybrid” sits on the lawn. From the southside of Chicago, Hunt broke ground as an African-American sculptor creating public works, many of which can be found in the permanent collections of the top museums across the United States. The lobby at 910 displays a bronze Virginio Ferrari sculpture. Further inside, they live among an extensive, curated collection of 150 works of art displayed in the public spaces. Inside, the buildings house over 150 collector’s pieces displayed in resident common spaces. In 2019, Israeli artist Assaf Evron, who resides in Chicago, created Collage for the Esplanade Apartments public art piece, displayed in thirty of the lower units facing Lake Shore Drive. Residents joined in a celebratory unveiling of the piece. Evron was inspired both by Mies’ connection of architecture and nature, as well as his upbringing in Tel Aviv–home to many Bauhaus buildings. Photographs taken between 2017 and 2018 of the buildings–including interior shots inside some of the residents’ apartments–are included in the book Living with Mies, by German photographer Arina Dähnick. Management and Renovations By today’s buildings codes and restrictions, the design of the 900/910 buildings can never be reproduced again. The buildings were converted from apartments to condominiums in 1979. They are managed by the Community Specialist management group, and overseen by the association board’s architecture committee–comprised primarily of resident architects. The committee goes to painstaking lengths to ensure that any updates or changes to the historic buildings are in keeping with Mies’ original intention. Occasionally custom work is required to maintain the buildings’ aesthetic, such as the die cut numbers in the elevator. The firm Eifler & Associates created the sheltered stairwell to the resident underground parking garage. 900 910 is a member of SOAR along with many other residential buildings.

Planning and design  In 1870 a pier for Coatham was proposed. After much discussion the decision was made to place the pier on Newcomen Terrace at the end of Newcomen Street - renamed Station Road in 1935. On 22 September 1870 the Coatham Victoria Pier Company was registered and days later an Act of Parliament was obtained to construct the pier. The pier was planned to be long with two pavilions and two tollbooth kiosks. One pavilion located midway along was for orchestral music and the other, east of the entrance was to house a roller skating rink.  Construction, damage and opening  Work on Coatham pier started in 1871. The pier was partially opened to the public from July 1872. During a storm on 8 December 1874, before construction was complete, two ships collided with the pier - the schooner Griffin of Southampton and the schooner Corrymbus of Dundee causing two breaches in the pier, cutting it in three. The Griffin with a crew of seven was carrying a cargo of oak in a heavy north easterly storm when in driving rain and high seas the crew failed to see the end of the incomplete pier and collided with it at about 4 am on the 9th. The crew escaped by climbing onto the pier. The ship then swung round in the gale and went through the pier broadside on and beached a mile up Coatham Sands. In the same storm the Corrymbus was driven through the pier between the pavilions then grounded a mile and a half up Coatham Sands. The crew came ashore when the tide receded. That night a total of four vessels came ashore on that stretch of coast but due to the actions of the rocket men, lifeboat and coastguard no lives were lost. Due to high repair costs the decision was made to reduce the planned pier length by and build to a length of . The pier was complete by 1875 opening that year.  Operation and destruction  The pier was shorter than originally planned but it still had the music pavilion halfway along, the indoor roller skating rink pavilion and two kiosks at the entrance, one for a toll booth and the other for selling newspapers and books. On 22 October 1898 Coatham Pier was badly wrecked by the barque Birger from Rauma in Finland carrying a cargo of salt from San Carlo in Spain to Abo in Finland. In a major storm the boat was forced over Saltscar Rocks snapping her masts killing the captain and chief officer and made a breach in the pier isolating the music pavilion. The ship was wrecked and only two crew members were rescued while thirteen lives were lost. The bodies were washed ashore in places from Saltburn to Seaton Carew and buried there. The Birger was off the Norwegian coast when she was blown across the Dogger Bank and hit further trouble when she sprung a leak and lost her bilge pump. Distress signals from the Birger were seen off Robin Hood's Bay as the boat was blown up the coast by the intense gale. The isolated section of the pier collapsed a year later and was dismantled. In 1899, the pier company failed, and the remainder of the pier was abandoned to disintegrate and was eventually sold for scrap. This left the roller skating rink pavilion and the entrance kiosks. Years later the anchor of the Birger was found by divers, brought ashore and placed in a railed off sea front display near the Zetland Lifeboat Museum.  Redevelopment  In 1910 the roller skating pavilion was demolished by the local authority and replaced by a large glass and metal shelter nicknamed The Glasshouse incorporating the entrance kiosks. Regent Cinema, at the location of Coatham Pier entrance In 1928 the pavilion and kiosks were removed and the site redeveloped as the New Pavilion theatre. Larry Grayson, Mike Neville and others performed there. In 1964 the theatre was converted to the Regent Cinema. On an exterior wall of the cinema is a blue plaque commemorating the Victoria Pier.

She grew up in London and studied painting under Bernard Lens III. Most of her surviving portraits are of family and friends, and there is also a picture of Mary Queen of Scots. Da Costa was the first female Anglo-Jewish artist of note. In her personal life, she married Moses da Costa and had six children.  Early life  right Catherine Rachel Mendes was the eldest daughter of Fernando and Isabel Mendes, Portuguese Jews who had fled the Spanish Inquisition and married in London. Her father was doctor to both King Charles II and Queen consort Catherine of Braganza, having converted to Roman Catholicism. Catherine Mendes was baptized at Somerset House (but given the Jewish name of Rachel) and Catherine of Braganza became her godmother. The family lived between Budge Row in the City of London and Highgate House (later known as Cromwell House), sharing the houses with Fernando Mendes' cousin Alvaro da Costa and raising the children as Jews. On 13 August 1698, Catherine Mendes married da Costa's son Moses da Costa in a synagogue. Moses da Costa was a wealthy merchant and together with him, Catherine da Costa had six children.  Career  Catherine da Costa was taught to paint miniature portraits by Bernard Lens III and most of her surviving works are portraits of friends and family. These include a miniature of her ten year-old son Abraham da Costa which is now owned by the Jewish Museum. However, a full-length watercolour portrait of her father hangs in the Bevis Marks Synagogue and da Costa also painted the Imaginary Portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542–1587), which hangs at Ham House in Surrey. Da Costa was well-regarded as a painter and also impressed Voltaire with her wit when he visited London in the mid-1720s. He recorded an exchange between her and a priest in his notebooks:  Death and legacy  Catherina da Costa died on 11 December 1756 and was buried in the Mile End Jewish cemetery. Her son Abraham inherited her artworks and some are now owned by the Joods Historisch Museum in Amsterdam. She was the first female Anglo-Jewish artist of note. A book called Smitten by Catherine was published in 2016 about her life and work.  Notes  # \\"Madame Acosta dit en ma presence a un abbé qui vouloit la faire chrêtienne. Votre Dieu, est il né juif?

It is named after John Buckmaster, an early settler who died in 1752 and was the first person to be buried in the Old Westwood Cemetery. The pond appears in historical records as early as 1827, when it was used for baptisms. In 1885, when Westwood was part of the town of Dedham as the Parish of West Dedham, the water rights of the pond were sold to the neighboring town of Norwood. The anger around selling off of a local water source was a contributing reason for the parish to split from Dedham, which is did when Westwood was incorporated as a town in 1897. Norwood built a pumping station and continued to use the pond as a water source until the late 1970s, when it was discontinued due to unidentified contamination and cheaper water being available from the water district that would become the MWRA.

It is named after Ronald Graham and Bruce Lee Rothschild, who published its proof in 1971. Through the work of Graham, Rothschild, and in 1972, it became part of the foundations of structural Ramsey theory. A special case of the Graham–Rothschild theorem motivates the definition of Graham's number, a number that was popularized by Martin Gardner in Scientific American and listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest number ever appearing in a mathematical proof. Background The theorem involves sets of strings, all having the same length n, over a finite alphabet, together with a group acting on the alphabet. A combinatorial cube is a subset of strings determined by constraining some positions of the string to contain a fixed letter of the alphabet, and by constraining other pairs of positions to be equal to each other or to be related to each other by the group action. This determination can be specified more formally by means of a labeled parameter word, a string with wildcard characters in the positions that are not constrained to contain a fixed letter and with additional labels describing which wildcard characters must be equal or related by the group action. The dimension of the combinatorial cube is the number of free choices that can be made for these wildcard characters. A combinatorial cube of dimension one is called a combinatorial line. For instance, in the game of tic-tac-toe, the nine cells of a tic-tac-toe board can be specified by strings of length two over the three-symbol alphabet {1,2,3} (the Cartesian coordinates of the cells), and the winning lines of three cells form combinatorial lines. Horizontal lines are obtained by fixing the y-coordinate (the second position of the length-two string) and letting the x-coordinate be chosen freely, and vertical lines are obtained by fixing the x-coordinate and letting the y-coordinate be chosen freely. The two diagonal lines of the tic-tac-toe board can be specified by a parameter word with two wildcard characters that are either constrained to be equal (for the main diagonal) or constrained to be related by a group action that swaps the 1 and 3 characters (for the antidiagonal). The set of all combinatorial cubes of dimension d, for strings of length n over an alphabet A with group action G, is denoted [A,G]\\\\tbinom{n}{d}. A subcube of a combinatorial cube is another combinatorial cube of smaller dimension that forms a subset of the set of strings in the larger combinatorial cube. The subcubes of a combinatorial cube can also be described by a natural composition action on parameter words, obtained by substituting the symbols of one parameter word for the wildcards of another. Statement With the notation above, the Graham–Rothschild theorem takes as parameters an alphabet A, group action G, finite number of colors r, and two dimensions of combinatorial cubes m and k with m > k. It states that, for every combination of A, G, r, m, and k, there exists a string length n\\\\ge m such that, if each combinatorial cube in [A,G]\\\\tbinom{n}{k} is assigned one of r colors, then there exists a combinatorial cube in [A,G]\\\\tbinom{n}{m} all of whose k-dimensional subcubes are assigned the same color. An infinitary version of the Graham–Rothschild theorem is also known. Applications The special case of the Graham–Rothschild theorem with m=1, k=0, and the trivial group action is the Hales–Jewett theorem, stating that if all long-enough strings over a given alphabet are colored, then there exists a monochromatic combinatorial line. A 2-coloring of the combinatorial lines of a three- dimensional binary cube, and a monochromatic combinatorial plane in this colored cube Graham's number is a bound for the Graham–Rothschild theorem with A=2, r=2, m=2, k=1, and a nontrivial group action. For these parameters, the set of strings of length n over a binary alphabet describes the vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube, every two of which form a combinatorial line. The set of all combinatorial lines can be described as the edges of a complete graph on the vertices. The theorem states that, for a high-enough dimension n, whenever this set of edges of the complete graph is assigned two colors, there exists a monochromatic combinatorial plane: a set of four hypercube vertices that belong to a common geometric plane and have all six edges assigned the same color. Graham's number is an upper bound for this number n, calculated using repeated exponentiation; it is believed to be significantly larger than the smallest n for which the statement of the Graham–Rothschild theorem is true.

Viltolarsen is an antisense oligonucleotide. The most common side effects include upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, cough, and pyrexia (fever). Viltolarsen was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020. After golodirsen was approved in December 2020, viltolarsen is the second approved targeted treatment for people with this type of mutation in the United States. Approximately 8% of people with DMD have a mutation that is amenable to exon 53 skipping.  Medical uses  Viltolarsen is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in people who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. DMD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that results in an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The first symptoms are usually seen between three and five years of age and worsen over time. DMD occurs in approximately one out of every 3,600 male infants worldwide; in rare cases, it can affect females.  Adverse effects  The most common side effects include upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, cough, and pyrexia (fever). Although kidney toxicity was not observed in the clinical studies, the clinical experience is limited, and kidney toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides.  History  Viltolarsen was evaluated in two clinical studies with a total of 32 participants, all of whom were male and had genetically confirmed DMD. The increase in dystrophin production was established in one of those two studies, a study that included sixteen DMD participants, with eight participants receiving viltolarsen at the recommended dose. In the study, dystrophin levels increased, on average, from 0.6% of normal at baseline to 5.9% of normal at week 25. Trial 1 provided data for evaluation of the benefits of viltolarsen. The combined populations from both trials provided data for evaluation of the side effects of viltolarsen. Trial 1 was conducted at six sites in the United States and Canada and Trial 2 was conducted at five sites in Japan. All participants in both trials were on a stable dose of corticosteroids for at least three months before entering the trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that the applicant's data demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in people with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 53 skipping. A clinical benefit of the drug has not been established. In making this decision, the FDA considered the potential risks associated with the drug, the life-threatening and debilitating nature of the disease, and the lack of available therapies. The application for viltolarsen was granted priority review designation and the FDA granted the approval to NS Pharma, Inc.

In 2019 it was reported that despite being in League One, Sunderland's average gates were higher than those of such teams as Lyon, Napoli, Roma, Valencia, Juventus, and Porto. There are over 70 branches of official Supporters' Clubs in England and around the world, including North America, which started in 2013; Scotland; South Africa; Germany; a united Danish and Irish Supporters Branch; a separate Dublin supporters club; Australia; United Arab Emirates; Switzerland; and even North Korea. The club had an official quarterly magazine, called the Legion of Light, which season ticket holders received at no cost. It was discontinued in January 2017. One of the club's current fanzines is A Love Supreme. Others in the past have been It's The Hope I Can't Stand, It's An Easy One For Norman/It's An Easy One For Given, Sex and Chocolate, Wise Men Say and The Roker Roar (later The Wearside Roar). In recent years, blogging sites such as Roker Report have been popular. Demographics Support is drawn from across the North East, in particular County Durham, and beyond. The club has many supporter branches across the world, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Cambodia, and Greece. Sunderland held the seventh highest average home attendance out of the 20 clubs in the Premier League at the end of the 2013–14 season with an average of 41,089, and held the sixth highest average attendance in the 2014–15 season with an average of over 43,000. Sunderland fans often sell out allocations for away games: in the 2013–14 season, 9,000 Nicknames Sunderland's official nickname is 'The Black Cats'. The previous nickname, 'The Rokerites', was made obsolete after the club left Roker Park for the Stadium of Light in 1997. The new name was decided upon in a public vote in 2000. Despite the nickname being made official only relatively recently, the black cat has been used as an emblem of the club throughout most of its history. Photographs exist of players holding a black cat which made Roker Park its home in the 1900s and 1910s, and which was fed and watered by the football club. The club's first official badge featured a black cat sitting prominently in its centre. Politics According to YouGov statistics, supporters of Sunderland predominantly lean to the political left, and often sing \\"The Red Flag\\" during games. The appointment of Paolo Di Canio, who was accused of being a fascist, as manager in 2013 prompted fan protests and the immediate resignation of club Vice Chairman David Miliband due to Di Canio's \\"past political statements\\". It also met opposition from the Durham Miners' Association, which threatened to remove one of its mining banners from Sunderland's Stadium of Light, which is built on the former site of the Wearmouth Colliery, as a symbol of its anger over the appointment. While Sunderland fans are generally regarded as left wing, the hooligan firm Seaburn Casuals was known for having far-right associations. When 26 Seaburn Casuals hooligans were arrested in a police raid before the 1998 FIFA World Cup, some of them were found to be involved with neo-Nazi groups like Combat 18. Songs A song heard in every match is one to the chorus of \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" by Elvis Presley, with \\"Sunderland\\" being sang repeatedly after \\"but I can't help falling in love with you.\\" During Gus Poyet's tenure, Sunderland fans started singing \\"Things Can Only Get Better\\" by D:Ream. Supporters of Sunderland launched a campaign to get the song back into the chart, to coincide with their team's Capital One Cup Final on 2 March 2014 at Wembley Stadium. On 3 March 2014, the song re entered in the UK Dance Chart at No. 19. Also, Sunderland supporters often sing \\"The Red Flag\\" during games. Two of the most famous chants by Sunderland supporters are \\"I'm Sunderland till I die...\\" and \\"We're by far the greatest team, the World has ever seen\\" - with the former being chosen as the title of the Netflix show Sunderland 'Til I Die. One of the oldest Sunderland chants is \\"Ha'way the lads...\\" which was sang at Sunderland games as far back as the 1960s. Friendships and rivalries Traditionally, Sunderland's main rivals are Newcastle United, with whom they contest the Tyne–Wear derby. The club shared a rivalry with the now defunct Sunderland Albion in the 1880s and 1890s, a breakaway club formed by Sunderland's founder James Allan. In recent seasons the club has also developed a minor rivalry with Portsmouth, mainly stemming from the clubs meeting each other 5 times in the 18/19 season. Conversely, sections of fans share a mutual friendship with Dutch club Feyenoord; this was developed after Wearside shipbuilders found jobs in Rotterdam during the 1970s and 80s.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1724981-7-friendships-between- football-clubshttps://rokerreport.sbnation.com/2018/11/22/18107742/meet-the- branches-chatting-to-the-boisterous-feyenoord-mackems-branch-of-sunderland- supporters The club also has good relations with Norwich City, matches between the two clubs being known as the Friendship Trophy, following good rapport in the 1985 Milk Cup final. Hooliganism The most famous hooligan firm is the Seaburn Casuals, named after the Seaburn area near Roker Park stadium, even though early hooligan firms of Sunderland fans appeared as far back as the 1970s and the 1980s, like the Vauxies (named after the Vaux Breweries), who were active in the late 1970s and early 1980s. At the end of the 1999–2000 and the 2002–03 seasons, Sunderland topped the hooliganism table in the Premier League with 223 and 154 fan arrests, respectively. According to official data released by the Football Banning Order Authority, Sunderland's fanbase was named third most dangerous in English football in 2013–14, and in particular, a group called The Sunderland Youth Firm was noted in the context of its clashes with West Ham United fans. Before the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 26 Seaburn Casuals hooligans were arrested in a police raid after a military-issue smoke bomb was let out at a local pub after a fight with bouncers. By the end of the operation, over 60 were facing charges. Some of the Seaburn Casuals hooligans picked up in the raid were also involved with neo-Nazi groups like Combat 18. The operation failed when judge ruled CCTV footage from the pub inadmissible. In March 2002, the Seaburn Casuals fought with hooligans from the Newcastle Gremlins in a pre-arranged clash near the North Shields Ferry terminal, in what was described as \\"some of the worst football related fighting ever witnessed in the United Kingdom\\". The leaders of the Gremlins and Casuals were both jailed for four years for conspiracy, with 28 others jailed for various terms, based on evidence gained after police examined the messages sent by mobile phone between the gang members on the day.

It was painted in 1480 while Bellini was in Constantinople on a diplomatic mission, although . This painting is a record of the significant economic and diplomatic ties that existed between Venice and the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. After a peace treaty is brokered between the Venetian Republic and the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan Mehmet II decided that he would like a painter to be in his presence and paint for him, this task was placed upon Gentile Bellini. For a brief period in time, retouchings in the 19th century brought into question who the original painter was. Bellini's portrait left a lasting influence on Ottoman painting; several paintings, one attributed to Shiblizade Ahmed, exist that derive their compositions from Bellini's. The Portrait of Mehmet II is now held in the National Gallery, London.

It was their 15th consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football since their promotion from the Nationalliga B the season 1945–46. They played their home games in the Landhof, in the Wettstein Quarter in Kleinbasel. Ernst Weber was the club's chairman for his second consecutive season.  Overview  Jenő Vincze was Basel's team manager for the second season. The West German ex-international footballer Gerhard Siedl joined the team from Bayern Munich during the summer off-season, but he was to leave the club again during the winter break. Hanspeter Stocker joined the team, coming from third tier local club Concordia Basel. Two further new players were Antonio Danani coming from FC Moutier and Fernando Von Krannichfeldt who signed in from FC Mendrisiostar. In the other direction midfielder Jean- Jacques Maurer moved to Servette, allrounder Otto Ludwig moved to third tier local club Old Boys, and forward Roberto \\"Mucho\\" Frigerio moved on to score his goals for La Chaux-de-Fonds. Another player who left the squad was defender Werner Bopp who moved on to Nordstern Basel and retired. Bopp had played 16 seasons for Basel, playing in 321 league and 43 cup matches scoring 15 goals in during these appearences. Basel played a total of 43 games this season. Of these 43 matches 26 were in the domestic league, one was in the Swiss Cup and 16 were friendly matches. Of these test matches five were played as hosts and 11 were played away, 12 were won, two were drawn and two ended with a defeat. The team scored 55 goals and conceded 29. The two defeats were suffered at the Landhof against VfR Mannheim and in the St. Jakob Stadium against Santos. The match against Santos was one of the highlights of these test games despite the 2–8 defeat. Gottlieb Stäuble and Josef Hügi scored the goals for Basel. Coutinho scored five and Pelé scored three for Santos. 14,000 spectators paid for a ticket to see the game, much needed money in the bad financial situation that the club was suffering. Fourteen teams contested the 1960–61 Nationalliga A, these were the top 12 teams from the previous season and the two newly promoted teams Young Fellows Zürich and Fribourg. The Championship was played in a double round-robin, the champions were to be qualified for 1961–62 European Cup and the last two teams in the table were to be relegated. Despite a home defeat against Young Fellows in the very first match, Basel started the season well, winning six of their first eight matches. But then came a run with six consecutive defeats in which the team failed to score a single goal. Basel slipped from the table top down to the relegation zone before they managed to return to winning games. Basel ended the season in 5th position with 28 points, but were 18 points behind the new Swiss Champions Servette. Basel were appointed as one of four Swiss representatives in the newly founded International Football Cup, which was to take place in the summer break after the end of this season. The other three teams who competed in the 1961–62 International Football Cup were La Chaux-de- Fonds, Grenchen and Zürich. Basel entered the Swiss Cup in the third principal round. They were drawn away against third tier local club Concordia Basel and for Basel the game ended in a fiasco. Despite an early 1–0 lead and in total 18–0 corners, Werner Decker and Heinz Wirz each scored for the under dogs who had a very young Karl Odermatt in their team. Basel lost 2–1 and were eliminated form the competition. Odermatt's football skills were noted, later he and Decker would later transfer to Basel.  Players  The following is the list of the Basel first team squad during the season 1960–61. The list includes players that were in the squad on the day that the Nationalliga A season started on 28 August 1960 but subsequently left the club after that date. ;Players who left the squad  Results  ;Legend  Friendly matches  Preseason = Winter break and mid-season  Nationalliga A  League matches = League table  Swiss Cup = See also  * History of FC Basel * List of FC Basel players * List of FC Basel seasons  References  Sources  * Die ersten 125 Jahre.

Founded in opposition to the Vietnam War, the group often met at Willens' beachfront house on Malibu Colony Road, and also in Sheinbaum's home in Westwood, Los Angeles, where he held a regular political salon with liberal participants, especially from the film and television industries of Greater Los Angeles. The Malibu Mafia were known for funding the failed George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign, the legal defense of Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, the successful 1973 campaign by African-American politician Tom Bradley to become the mayor of Los Angeles, the 1978 salvaging of the progressive magazine The Nation, the Nuclear Freeze campaign of the 1980s, and the Israel–Palestine negotiations that yielded the Oslo Accords in 1993. The first publication of the term \\"Malibu Mafia\\" was in Newsweek magazine in 1978: Sheinbaum was quoted complaining about the inexperience of Hamilton Jordan.Newsweek, 1978. \\"'I'm told that Hamilton Jordan is the one strategizing the Middle East, and I get the feeling that the man never heard of the Middle East until two years ago,' said Los Angeles millionaire Stanley K. Sheinbaum, a member of the local Democratic fund-raising apparatus known as the 'Malibu Mafia.'\\" The moniker was applied to the wealthy men by the media, not by themselves. Actors Paul Newman and Warren Beatty were associated peripherally with the Malibu Mafia, as was singer and Malibu resident Barbra Streisand. Television writer Albert \\"Al\\" Ruben (known for The Defenders and more) argued positions to the left of Sheinbaum. The group was not always cohesive; they often acted individually and occasionally worked at cross purposes. The Malibu Mafia was the more liberal and idealistic challenger to the 1960s–1990s fundraising efforts of Jewish political donor Lew Wasserman, chairman of MCA, whose views have been characterized as centrist and pragmatic. In the late 1970s as the Malibu Mafia peaked, Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden headed an informal group of younger liberal donors and activists called \\"The Network\\". In the 1980s, Streisand joined with Fonda and other well-connected women to found the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, a nonprofit organization which funded many liberal causes. Causes=Daniel Ellsberg legal defense Activist \\"Ping\\" Ferry called Sheinbaum to help gather funds for the legal defense of Daniel Ellsberg who had released the Pentagon Papers which demonstrated that the US government had lied about the expansion of the Vietnam War. Ellsberg was being tried for conspiracy, espionage, and theft of government property, and was facing a possible prison sentence of 115 years. Sheinbaum gave Ellsberg $900,000 over two years to help with his defense, which cost $50,000 to $70,000 per month. One of the fundraising parties was a private concert by Barbra Streisand at which more than $50,000 was raised. Accompanied by Marvin Hamlisch leading a piano trio, Streisand took song requests for $1,000 to $3,000 each. George McGovern for president George McGovern ran in 1972 as the anti-war candidate Palevsky gave $319,000 to Senator George McGovern in early 1972 when his campaign had run out of cash. Rubin gave $150,000 — his first political contribution. Subsequent campaign finance reforms put a stop to such large donations. Tom Bradley for mayor In 1973, the group backed Tom Bradley's second run for mayor of Los Angeles. Bradley had briefly led the 1969 contest against incumbent Sam Yorty, but Yorty regained momentum and won. During his term, Yorty was deeply distracted with his own ambitions to higher office, and Palevsky decided to back Bradley's second attempt. Palevsky headed a finance committee that was the largest donor to Bradley. (A young Gray Davis assisted Palevsky on the committee, and would himself see funding from Palevsky during his political career.) Bradley won the race to become the first African- American mayor of a major US city. Breakup of Big Oil Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman spoke out against Big Oil In 1975, five members of the Malibu Mafia (without Palevsky) met in Malibu to discuss the problems created by Big Oil. They determined to fight for more democratic control of United States energy policy. They formed the Energy Action Committee (EAC), initially funded with $500,000. Early in 1976, Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward served as the voices of the EAC in Washington D.C. According to The New York Times, the EAC was formed \\"to prevent deregulation of natural gas prices and to propel through Congress legislation to break up the big oil companies into separate producing, refining and marketing entities.\\" The Nation magazine In 1978, Sheinbaum and Lear led the Malibu Mafia in underwriting the struggling progressive magazine The Nation, organized under publisher Hamilton Fish as silent partners. Each donor promised $5,000 annually to keep the perennially unprofitable publication in print. 1980 presidential election In 1979 leading up to the 1980 United States presidential election, most of the Malibu Mafia opposed the re-election of President Jimmy Carter, and they formed Democrats for Change. The group initially preferred Ted Kennedy as the Democratic candidate. In 1980 when Republican John B. Anderson announced his independent bid, the group backed him; he strongly supported the Equal Rights Amendment. Lear was a prominent supporter of Anderson. Palevsky was not involved in this effort: he liked Carter. People for the American Way Lear headed the effort to found People for the American Way in 1980, for the purpose of opposing the Christian right. One of the group's successes was the 1987 opposition to Robert Bork as Reagan's Supreme Court nominee. Sheinbaum backed Lear in this effort. Bilateral nuclear weapons freeze In 1981, Willens pushed his colleagues to fund the bilateral nuclear freeze movement, to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1982, the Willens- created group Californians for a Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze put a nuclear freeze ballot initiative in front of California voters. The proposal was not asking for nuclear reduction or disarmament; rather, it suggested a stop to further expansion, with California to ask the federal government to \\"immediately halt the testing, production and further deployment of all nuclear weapons, missiles and delivery systems in a way that can be checked and verified by both sides.\\" Paul Newman attracted publicity by announcing his support. Willens spoke before Congress on the topic of nuclear freeze, and named Leopold Wyler as a supporter, among others. By October, about $1.8 million had been spent on the campaign, with most of it from Willens. Willens later said that $4 million was raised in total. California voters passed Proposition 12 in November 1982, directing the state governor to request a nuclear freeze at the federal level. Governor Jerry Brown was unable to elicit a response from President Ronald Reagan, nor could Senator Alan Cranston. Willens eventually met personally with Reagan through his friendship with the president's rebellious daughter, Patti. At the White House, Reagan was dismissive, telling Willens that the Soviets were ahead in the nuclear arms race, that the United States should catch up before a freeze could be considered. Willens argued that the Soviets could be destroyed several times over by the current United States stockpile, but Reagan was not moved. Israel–Palestine talks Sheinbaum felt strongly that peace between Israel and Palestine could only be obtained by Israel yielding territory and autonomy to Palestine — a two-state solution. In 1987, Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson spoke to Israeli representatives about a possible peace solution; he thought that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) should discuss this same idea with American Jews before engaging in direct talks with Israel. Andersson contacted Sheinbaum, who assembled a small group of three other American Jews to meet in November 1988 in Sweden with four high-ranking PLO officials. After conferring with Colin Powell, Sheinbaum and five colleagues met directly with Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the PLO, in December in Sweden to determine what positions he held with regard to peace, and especially to find out whether Arafat would promise to stop supporting terrorism. With a positive result, Arafat spoke to the United Nations later in December, convened in Switzerland to allow him to attend, as George Shultz refused to issue him a visa to visit New York. This initiated a series of Israel–Palestine talks culminating in the Oslo Accords of 1993. Members *Stanley Sheinbaum taught economics at Stanford University and Michigan State University, and he married Warner Bros. heiress Betty Warner in 1964. He engineered the release of imprisoned Greek leader Andreas Papandreou in 1967. He invested Betty's money and nearly doubled it in 1971 by correctly predicting that the US would abandon the Bretton Woods system gold standard. He ran a salon at his house in Westwood to discuss liberal causes. He put a very large stake in the Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and sat as chairman. While serving as a Regent of the University of California, he pushed for divestment from South Africa because of racist apartheid practices. *Ted Ashley, born Theodore Assofsky in 1922, became head of Warner Bros. in 1970, and returned the company to profitability with the film Woodstock. Ashley was not impressed by McGovern's 1972 run for president, and instead donated $137,000 to Nixon. *Norman Lear started writing for television in the 1950s. He began producing TV shows, and by the late 1960s he had also produced several films. Greater success came with 1971's All in the Family series followed by 1972's Sanford and Son. After working with the Malibu Mafia to back Democratic Party candidates, Lear greatly reduced his political activity in 1992. *Max Palevsky designed computer components in the 1950s, then founded Scientific Data Systems in 1961. Xerox bought the company in 1969, providing $100 million to Palevsky, who invested in Intel. His first big political contribution was to McGovern in 1972. In the 1970s, Palevsky helped to found the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and he bankrolled the short-lived journal democracy in 1980, choosing Sheldon Wolin as editor. Palevsky raised funds in 2007 to help Barack Obama with the 2008 United States presidential election. *Harold Willens was born in Ukraine, escaped death in the Kiev pogroms (1919), and in 1922 settled in the US when he was eight years old. He served in the United States Marines in the Pacific War, and was deeply moved by viewing the devastation of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He became wealthy through real estate holdings on Wilshire Boulevard. He was the Malibu base of the Malibu Mafia; his two-story home on Malibu Beach was used for meetings. In 1968 he founded the Businessmen's Educational Fund to reduce the influence of the defense industry on government policy, to stop the nuclear arms race. Willens later conceived the Nuclear Freeze movement, and helped fund it. Willens was a Jewish atheist. *Leopold \\"Leo\\" Wyler was the head of Tool Research and Engineering Corporation, making missile parts for the defense industry. In 1973 he partnered with ex-Rockwell Frank Jameson to form J-W Corporation for international trading. Jameson had recently become Eva Gabor's fifth husband. Wyler and Jameson hired Spiro Agnew as a consultant. *Miles L. Rubin funded the development of a fuel cell for cars in the early 1970s, which did not yield practical results. He formed Reliance Manufacturing which made parachutes and ejection seats for the US military. The company Polo Ralph Lauren Jeanswear was founded by Rubin in 1990, and he sold it at a profit in 1997 to Jones Apparel. He formed the apparel company Sun/Greater Texas which sold for $150,000,000 in 1997. He formed Miles Electric Vehicles in 2004 so that he could help the environment. At Stanford Law School, Rubin established the Miles L. Rubin Public Interest Award, \\"awarded annually to an alumnus/a using law and/or advocacy in the public interest.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Barbra Streisand sings the Joni Mitchell song \\"I Don't Know Where I Stand\\" at a Malibu Mafia fundraiser.

The regiment's successor, the 79éme Régiment d'Infanterie continued to serve in the modern French Army until 1940 when it was disbanded following the Battle of France.  Formation  The Chasseurs Cantabres were formed from and were to recruit exclusively from troops of the Pyrénées provinces of Béarn and Gascony, because of the battalion's region from which it was recruit and troops of the region, it became a Princes' Regiment. This new designation meant that the battalion would keep the titles, salaries, and prerogatives established by its Colonel, on formation, the Comte de Montréal. On 17 March 1788, as part of the 1788 Ordnance, the Régiment de Montréal was transformed from the infantry corps to the new light infantry corps (Corps d'Infanterie Légère), under the new title of Chasseurs Cantabres. On formation, the new battalion became 5th in precedence, after the Chasseurs Corses and before the Chasseurs Bretons.Susane, Volume I, pp. 311, 313–314, 364, 369, 399, 404.Susane, Volume VII, pp. 361–364. The regiment's first uniform consisted of; black tricone (officers in bicorne), dark green collar, dark green turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, dark green pockets, dark green cuff flaps, bright yellow cuffs, and white buttons.Lienhart & Humbet, pp. 57–58.Smith, Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 42–47. The ordnance of 9 April and the reorganisation of the corps on 1 May expanded to battalion when it absorbed the 'non corsican' elements of the Chasseurs Royaux Corses. Shortly after, the battalion reached its establishment size, it formed in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, and its headquarters established there. The battalion would remain here, and never leave the Western Pyrenees or on the border of France–Spain border.  Revolution  On 1 April 1791, provisional regulations were announced following the initial stages of the French Revolution, and the regiment renamed as the 5éme Bataillon de Chasseurs (Cantabres), but they continued to be known as their former title until 1792. In addition to the new title, the regiment adopted a new uniform; peak casque, with stiff black horsehair crest and mock leopard skin turban helmet, dark green collar, dark green turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, dark green pockets, dark green cuff flaps, bright yellow cuffs, and white buttons.  War of the First Coalition  Regimental uniform after the 1791 provisional regulations, showing the new casque helmet.  Defence of the Border  When the War of the Pyrenees began in March 1793, the battalion was still stationed in Saint-Jean, but on 23 April moved to a frontier post near Biriatou. As the Spanish tried to cross the Bidasoa into France, the battalion held off and killed 30 and drowned 40. That day, the enemy army attacked Fort d'Andaye. The republicans, surprised, were seeking their salvation in fight, when Lieutenant Colonel Willot, at the head of the major part of the battalion, rushed on the enemy and awakened the courage of the volunteers. This small action was instrumental in helping push the Spanish across the Bidasoa yet again. After this action, the new Army of the Western Pyrenees Armée des Pyrénées Occidentales was formed, and the battalion assigned along with their colleagues from the 1er Bataillon de Chasseurs (Provence).  Battle of Château-Pignon  On 6 June, during the Battle of Château-Pignon, near Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, the battalion, under the orders of Marshal Bon Andrien Jannot de Moncey, Duke of Conegliano, overwhelmed the enemy and took six cannons from them. But, when the fog cleared over the battlefield, the Spanish realised how much of a disadvantage the republicans were in, and charged the hill forcing them to withdraw. At the same time, the volunteers abandoned their positions, and the chasseurs along with a company of grenadiers from the 80éme Régiment d'Infanterie de Ligne (Angoumois) held off the Spaniards for a further three hours. During this occasion, surrounded with no hope of escape, General Largentère took refuge within the ranks of the chasseurs, cried, and said \\"Puisque je ne puis rallier les fyards, que je vienne au moins périr au milieu de vois\\", (roughly translated): \\"Since I cannot rally the fuguitives (assuming these are the volunteers), (that) I at least (can) come to perish in the middle of you\\". The Spaniards eventually had to retreat and the republican bravely held their ground. During this campaign, according to official Spanish documents, the battalion were nicknamed \\"les Ours\\", \\"The Bears\\" for their defence and illusion to the mane of their casque helmets.  End of the Campaign  On 5 February 1794, the battalion again distinguished itself and took immense glory through its troops during the defence of the Sans-Culottes. Moncey ill for 15 days, despite his illness took to the front of the battalion, held against the Spaniards and charged them, before returning to camp later that day. During the initial attack, Corporal Dufour was taken prisoner by four Spaniards but, seized the bayonet of one of them, killed three, and seized the fourth by the collar and brought him back to camp. The years following the Revolution saw great changes for the French Army: the old royalist infantry regiments were to serve as the stiffening for the tens of thousands of new volunteers who answered the patriotic Levée en masse. In the First Amalgamation of 1794, each old royalist battalion was put together with two new volunteers battalions to become new Demi-Brigade de Bataille or Demi-Brigade of Battle. Therefore, on 23 April 1795, two years to the day after they saw their first action, the battalion amalgamated with the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Chasseurs of the Mountains to form the 5éme Demi-Brigade Légère, thus ending the royalist lineage and traditions.  Commanding Officers  Commanding officers of the regiment were: * 1788–1791 Jean Baptiste André Isidore, Comte de Ruault de La Bonerie * 1791–1791 François de Bazent du Balay * 1791–1792 Alexandre de Lalain * 1792–1793 Amédée de Willot * 1793–1795 Bon Andrien Jannot de Moncey  Footnotes  References  * Louis Susane, Historie de l'Ancienne Infanterie Français, Volume I, 1849 Naval and Polytechnical Military Library of Paris, Paris, France. * Louis Susane, Historie de l'Ancienne Infanterie Français, Volume VII, 1853 Naval and Polytechnical Military Library of Paris, Paris, France. * Dr. Constance Lienhart & Réne Humbert, The Uniforms of French Armies 1690–1894; Volume 3: The Infantry, Originally published in 1906, re-printed in 2020, Zanica, Italy. . * Digby Smith & Jeremy Black, An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars, 2015 Lorenz Books, London, United Kingdom. .

It became a grade II listed structure in 1974. Margaret Ethel MacDonald (1870–1911) was a British feminist and social reformer, and the wife of the Labour politician Ramsay MacDonald. The couple lived at 3 Lincoln's Inn Fields, and had six children. She died from blood poisoning in 1911, many years before he became the Labour Party's first prime minister in 1929. The memorial comprises a public seat within an alcove created by a granite surround, on which is mounted a bronze sculptural group portraying MacDonald kneeling with her arms outstretched protectively around a group of nine cherubic infant children who are laughing and playing. An inscription carved below the top edge of the stone surround reads: THIS SEAT IS IN MEMORY OF MARGARET MACDONALD WHO SPENT HER LIFE IN HELPING OTHERS. A bronze plaque mounted on the back of the seat list biographical details of her birth, marriage, and life: SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF JOHN & MARGARET GLADSTONE / SHE WAS BORN IN KENSINGTON IN 1870 · WAS MARRIED TO / RAMSAY MACDONALD IN 1896 AND LIVED WITH HIM AT / 3 LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS ·· HERE HER CHILDREN WERE / BORN AND HERE SHE DIED IN 1911 · SHE BROUGHT JOY / TO THOSE WITH WHOM AND FOR WHOM SHE LIVED AND / WORKED · HER HEART WENT OUT IN FELLOWSHIP TO HER / FELLOW WOMEN & IN LOVE TO THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE / WHOM SHE SERVED AS A CITIZEN AND HELPED AS A SISTER · / SHE QUICKENED FAITH AND ZEAL IN OTHERS BY HER LIFE AND / TOOK NO REST FROM DOING GOOD.

Fleitas is a Cuban-American visual artist, photographer, and film director based in Miami, Florida. Fleitas was a television director and film editor for several popular television programs during his tenure with Univision and Telemundo. As an artist Fleitas has exhibited internationally, participated in high-profile exhibitions, and won awards since launching his art career in the 1980s. He is the son of Cuban filmmaker and artist Miguel Fleitas Sr. Background Miguel Angel Fleitas was born in Havana, Cuba on June 22, 1956. He was first exposed to film and the arts through his parents, who were prominent figures in 20th century Cuban film. His father, Miguel Fleitas Sr., was a painter and noted filmmaker who gained recognition for establishing the Cuban Institute of Arts and Industry Cinematography (Instituto Cubano de Artes e Industria Cinematografica; ICAIC) and served as its founding director. His mother, Clarivel Suarez, was a lead production assistant in film for the ICAIC. Among his father's many directorial film credits are the 1975 film The Smile of Victory, part of the Florida State University Libraries, as well as the 1979 film Etiopia Diario de una Victoria, which was added to the collection of Franklin and Marshall College's Phillips Museum of Art. Early life and career Fleitas attended primary school in Valdes Rodriguez within the city of Havana and subsequently conducted his pre- university studies at Saul Delgado high school, also in Havana. He began his professional work in media as a radio operator in the Havana Radio Station. In 1979 he transitioned from radio to film and began working in the ICAIC's Film Laboratory and training in film and photography. During this period and into the 1980s, Fleitas began participating in group exhibitions in Cuba. Alongside his work in the arts, he spent much of his early career also gaining recognition as a film director and cameraman. His film background would influence his approach to art in photography and later painting. Fleitas studied Art History in the University of Havana while he worked as Chief Graphic Designer for MINFAR Studios Film Department and later as their Documentaries Manager for Tourism. He also studied film and camera techniques in Havana with personal mentoring programs, completing his training in 1985.  United States film career  Fleitas emigrated from Cuba in 1986 and subsequently joined the Cuban diaspora community in exile within South Florida. While in the United States, he continued his art as well as directorial work, now transitioning into television with the two leading Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision. He worked for Telemundo for ten years from 1991–2001. In 1995 he graduated from the University of Oklahoma and also participated in National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) 35th Television News and Video Production Conference sponsored by Sony. During his tenure in Telemundo, Fleitas was first a cameraman, then reporter and finally editor of News Channel 51 in Miami. He then became Television and Technical Director for Venevision International (now Cisneros Media). In 2002 he also joined the national Univision, Telefutura, and Univision Deportes (Sports) Network as a floor manager and director. Fleitas worked for both Venevision International and Univision until he resigned from Venevision in 2006 to focus on his increasing demands with Univision. During his time with Venevision and Univision he directed a number of their most popular programs including ¿Quién Tiene la Razón?, Tu Desayuno Alegre, Escándalo TV, and Casos de Familia as well as soccer and boxing sports coverage. Fleitas retired from film and television in 2013 to fully dedicate himself to his fine art career. Art career Fleitas' fine art career began in the 1980s in Cuba with photography. He gained early recognition in 1982 for his series Farmers of the Sea. The black and white series was exhibited in the Pabellón Cuba in Havana which led to his winning a placement to tour and exhibit his work in twelve Latin American countries, his first professional award and recognition in the arts. The following year Fleitas enrolled in the University of Havana in 1983 studying Art History. In 1985 he won 6th Prize in the international Peace World Photography Exhibition in Poland for his series Happy Children. Despite this, his work in the arts remained secondary to his main career and profession as a media executive in the radio, film, and television industries for much of the following three decades. After emigrating to the United States, Fleitas began to expand his artistic mediums to include painting in the 1990s. By the 21st century, he would be an exhibiting artist in both solo and group exhibitions and win further awards. He has since become closely associated with his “The Breast Project” and his Gallo (Rooster) series of paintings, well as the “Giants in the City” public art exhibition series in Miami. Fleitas participated in the inaugural 2009 “Giants in the City” public art exhibition of monumental-scale sculptural installations organized by the Moore College of Art and Design. In addition to being a founding featured artist, Fleitas was also active in helping to organize the event. The event's success prompted a follow-up exhibition the following year at the Miami Beach Botanical Garden, in close proximity to the Miami Beach Convention Center that hosts Art Basel Miami. Fleitas was again invited to participate in the 2010 exhibition, held during Miami Art Week, which was well-received drawing large audiences. Fleitas again participated in the 2011 installment, which saw the venue move to the larger Bayfront Park of Downtown Miami during Art Basel Miami. Fleitas also participated in the 2014 and 2015 installments of the public art series. His notable photographic series include Stories in Time which captures stone sculptures in black and white, the nature series Quiet Moments as well as his award-winning Happy Children and Farmers of the Sea series, the latter of which was featured in the book Havana in My Heart: A celebration of Cuban Photography by Gareth Jenkins. Fleitas’ artwork is sold through several major art outlets including Saatchi Art, Artnet, and ArtPrice and others.  Style  Fleitas is an Expressionist influenced by the art movements of the 1970s as well as his Cuban cultural heritage. His paintings and photography are both influenced by his background in film and emphasize contrast and texture. His photographic style is most known for its use of black and white, but also occasionally ranges to include richly detailed color images. His subjects usually include depictions of scenes from Cuba and later his life in Miami after relocating to the United States. Fleitas' paints in oil, acrylic, and mixed-media. In contrast with his photography, color is at the forefront of his paintings which were described in his 2007 Nuevo Herald profile as \\"a festival of color.\\" Fleitas draws from a number of influences from his art history studies that he then applies to his Cuban cultural foundation. Examples include European Post-impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism, especially by way of Van Gogh, Matisse, and Picasso, respectively. Fleitas also draws influence from Cuban Vanguardia artists Victor Manuel, Mariano Rodríguez, and Mario Carreño. His father, Miguel Fleitas Sr., was another significant artistic influence with Fleitas dedicating his series Homenaje a mi padre of Cuban landscapes to his father. Fleitas often depicts Cuban- associated scenes such as tropical landscapes, roosters and female nude studies, with vivid and saturated color to enhance vibrancy. His female torso series are often abstracted, such as without heads. Fleitas utilizes expressionistic methods to depict the female form in a purposefully sexualized way, utilizing bold exaggeration to challenge modern societal beauty conventions and standards that women are held to, particularly in Latin America. Fleitas also explored Latin American women as a subject in his Private Landscapes series. In addition to his torso paintings, another expression of this subject is his public art installation series The Breast Project of monumental-scale inflatable breast-shaped sculptures which have been prominently featured in the \\"Giants in the City\\" exhibitions held during Art Basel Miami and Miami Art Week. In his artist statement for The Breast Project, Fleitas explained “The word ‘breast’ is a metaphor for ‘women’ in general\\" and that the series is designed to \\"challenge our contemporary ideas of beauty, to counter stereotypes and to depict non-idealized women,\\" including reactions against the widespread pressures of artificial breast augmentation and other modern cosmetic \\"obsessions\\" that exist in modern life. In interviews Fleitas expanded on this, describing these works as “a tribute to the sacrifice of Latin women, who are forced to modify their image so as to compete in a world marked by limited beauty canons.” In contrast with these abstracted works, his Gallo (rooster) series, focuses on roosters, a quintessential symbol of Cuba, that are frequently done in large scales with an intricately detailed style, often offsetting the hyper-detailed representations of the roosters in black-and-white sketching with selective color usage, evoking his photographic work. When interviewed by El Nuevo Herald for the 2018 “Rooster Gallo Galo Gallus” exhibition at the Milander Center for Arts, Fleitas explained the inspiration behind his Gallo series to be “I have wanted to represent this animal as a bird with great strength, courage, respect, admiration and power.” To this end, each work in the series features only a single color and is paired with intense underlying drawings to communicate a bold, streamlined effect. Fleitas also explained that his figurative depictions of roosters drew historical inspiration from gladiators in a symbolic reference to their popular use in cockfights throughout Latin America. Fleitas has also composed diptychs and triptychs of his rooster and torso series. In describing his general creative process, Fleitas has said \\"To me painting has always been a great mystery, like a secret and something I've always loved [...] I don’t measure myself – I express myself. I don’t think about rules, but instead I think about the moment.\\" Exhibitions To date, Fleitas has participated in over thirty exhibitions of his art. As both a solo artist and in group exhibitions, Fleitas has exhibited in several prominent fine art markets including New York City, the Wynwood Art District, South Beach, Coral Gables, and Coconut Grove as well as internationally in Cuba, Europe, and Latin America.

Fleitas' first fine arts award came in 1982 when he won a place to tour twelve Latin American countries in the 1980s for his photography series Farmers of the Sea. He also won 6th Prize for his series Happy Children in the international Peace World Photographers Exhibition in Poland among hundreds of global entries. Fleitas also won the 2nd Prize in the 2007 Doral Art Festival, held in the Doral Country Club, for his photographs The Hunter, In Paradise, Golden Fruit, and Lovers. Fleitas has been closely affiliated with prominent South Florida art figures including curator Alejandro Mendoza, who organized and spearheaded the long-running “Giants in the City” public art installations, as well as Marcos and Josefina Pinedo, whose Cuban art collection features several works by Fleitas. When Fleitas retired from film to focus on his art, journalist Juan Manuel Cao wrote “[Fleitas] has returned to his roots, because now his palette has broadened, even when doing black and white, and because he sees what the rest of do not: shadows, shades, unforeseen places.” On his photography, Cao stated: “Fleitas’ magic lens grants a poetic dignity [...] And this is, perhaps, the responsibility of true artists: to light up the corners of life which otherwise would have remained unnoticed.” In discussing Fleitas' work, writer Rubén Géller stated “Even though Miguel Fleitas insists on exhibiting life in black and white, the onlooker feels the colors and gets into the diversion of completing the visual rainbow. [Fleitas] is a detector of essences.” Fleitas was included in the Irreversible project magazine along with Pablo Cano and other leading Miami artists and has been covered by the Miami Herald, Hello Magazine, and several Spanish media outlets including El Nuevo Herald and Voz de America. His art is also featured in literature and books of Cuban art, including Havana in My Heart: A Celebration of Cuban Photography, (republished in English and French in 2004), and Mujer Desnuda (2012) Personal life Fleitas was named after his father, Miguel Fleitas Sr. (1926-2002), who was also a noted Cuban artist and film director. He has two children, a son, Hiram Fleitas, and daughter Ana Laura Fleitas, both fine art collectors and dealers. Fleitas currently works and resides in Miami, Florida.

It is also an alcoholic beverage made with milk, egg yolks and rum or cognac. Found in German and Austrian cuisine, the casserole dish is also associated with the cuisine of Minnesota in the Midwestern United States. The basic recipe for the casseole is home fries, ham or salami, onion and eggs. Sometimes, it is topped with melted cheese. Other ingredients like green pepper or mushrooms can be added to the basic combination, and a variety of meats can be used including bacon, ham and salami. Description The basic form of the dish was just potatoes, onions, meat and scrambled eggs, but more elaborate variations could be devised with green peppers, melted cheese and mushrooms. The meat could be ham, bacon, sausage, or even all-beef salami. Hoppel poppel was served at Jewish delicatessens (despite not strictly adhering to kosher dietary regulations) and these establishments made the dish with all-beef salami. It is also an alcoholic beverage, associated with the Netherlands, made with egg yolks, milk, cognac or rum, sugar, nutmeg and vanilla. Preparation=With bacon To make hoppel poppel the first step was to cook the meat in a skillet, then set the cooked meat aside and add the onions to cook in the drippings. The onions were removed from the pan once they took on a golden color, and butter was added to the remaining drippings, then the potatoes were seasoned with salt and pepper and when they were browned the meat and onions were returned to the pan and the eggs added under the eggs set. With beef salami Another way of making hoppel poppel without pork begins by parboiling the poatoes, then slicing them and frying in vegetable oil. Butter is added with onions, mushrooms, green peppers and beef salami. The eggs and whisked with milk and parsley and gently scrambled in the skillet. When the eggs have started to set the cheese topping can be added, and the dish cooked covered for a few more minutes until the cheese has melted and the eggs are fully cooked. With boiled beef Hoppel poppel could also be made with boiled beef to use up leftovers. This version of the dish begins by cooking the boiled beef and onion in butter, with bacon. When the bacon is cooked whisked eggs are added and cooked like an omelette. With ham For a hoppel poppel with ham, cubed potatoes and onions were pan-fried in butter until the potatoes were browned, then ham was added to the skillet. Eggs were whisked with cognac, salt and pepper, and Worcestershire sauce and poured into the skillet, cooked gently as an omelette, with fresh parsley. When the omelette is set it was topped with grated cheese and finished in the broiler.

He was a founding member and first Vice President of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. He was elected to membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia in June 1812, where he served as curator for multiple decades beginning in 1813. Lukens was blinded in one eye by \\"a chip of steel when dressing a grindstone\\" (c.1816), after which he took Joseph Saxton as his assistant. According to George Escol Sellers, whose father was close friends with Lukens, \\"he called [Saxton] his pupil, and he did honor to his preceptor\\".  Early Life and Family  Lukens was the son of Seneca Lukens and Sarah (Quinby) Lukens, who were married on June 10, 1777. The family was descended from Jan Lucken, who immigrated to the Pennsylvania colony in October 1683, with Daniel Pastorius, and was one of the original settlers of Germantown. Lukens grew up on his family's farm in Horsham, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and learned from his father to construct clocks and watches. He moved to Philadelphia around 1811.  Personality  George Escol Sellers wrote that he was \\"naturally of a social disposition, although an impediment in his speech made him appear shy and diffident in ladies' society. He called his shop his wife, and he really loved it.\\"  Scientific Activities  Lukens used a telescope with a plössl (symmetrical) eyepiece to observe the solar eclipse on September 18, 1838. His data were compiled with the independent observations of 14 other scientists from Philadelphia, and published in The American Journal of Science and Arts in 1840.  Notable Clocks  * Lukens built a clock for the tower of the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) in 1839, for the price of $5000. It was later removed to Germantown. * Christ Church in Philadelphia placed an order for a Lukens clock in 1827. * There is a Lukens clock (c.1840) at the Athenaeum of Philadelphia.

The Sainte-Marie River is the most westerly river in the SÉPAQ Anticosti territory. The \\"Rivière-Sainte-Marie\\" sports camp was built during the 20th century, west of the mouth of this stream. The main forest road (east-west) of Anticosti Island serves the upper part of this valley. A network of secondary roads connect to this main road, as well as to the west to a forest road network for forestry purposes. Forestry is the main economic activity in this area; recreational tourism activities, second.  Geography  The Sainte-Marie river draws its source from Lake Sainte-Marie (length: almost round in shape; altitude: ) located in the central-western part of the Anticosti Island. This lake has a marsh area on the north side and the south side. The mouth of Lac Sainte-Marie is located at: * northeast of the town center of the village of Port-Menier; * south-east of the north shore (Martin Bay) of Anticosti Island; * north of the south shore of Anticosti Island. From its source, the Sainte-Marie River flows south between the Bec-Scie River (located on the west side) and Rivière aux Cailloux (located on the east side). Its course descends on towards the south with a drop of , according to the following segments: * towards the south first, passing under the bridge of the main road (east-west direction) of the island, successively collecting a stream (coming from the north-east), the discharge (coming from the west) of Lac de la Tour and the discharge (coming from the east) of Lake Nelson, then crossing Lake Elsie (length: ; altitude: ), up to its mouth; * towards the south entering the territory of the SÉPAQ Anticosti, collecting four streams (coming from the west), two streams (coming from the east) and the discharge (coming from the northeast) of Paul Pond, forming a hook of towards the west at the end of the segment, up to its mouth. The Sainte-Marie river empties on the south shore of Anticosti Island, ie east of the mouth of Baleine stream, at west of Cap Sainte-Marie where the Sainte- Marie river flows and east of the center of the village of Port-Menier.  Toponymy  The toponyms \\"Cap Sainte-Marie\\", \\"rivière Sainte-Marie\\" and \\"Camp sportif Rivière-Sainte-Marie\\" are linked. The toponymic designation “Sainte- Marie River” is one of the oldest on Anticosti Island. It appears on the Map of Canada (or of New France), designed by Guillaume Delisle in 1703. The toponym “Rivière Ste Marie” appears in 1904 on a map drawn up by Joseph Schmitt, designating the watercourse west of the toponym \\"Falaises Ste Marie\\". The Commission de toponymie du Québec believes that this toponym was originally attributed by the explorer Louis Jolliet, who had become the owner of the island since 1680; he would have designated it in honor of his eldest daughter Marie-Charlotte. After becoming the owner of the island, Louis Jolliet spent his summers in the western part of Anticosti Island, where he had built a house. The toponym \\"rivière Sainte-Marie\\" was made official on December 5, 1968.Commission de toponymie du Québec - Rivière Sainte-Marie  Notes and references  See also  *Minganie Regional County Municipality *L'Île-d'Anticosti, a Municipality *Anticosti Island *Gulf of Saint Lawrence *List of rivers of Quebec  External links  Category:Rivers of Côte-Nord Category:Anticosti Island Category:Minganie Regional County Municipality ","title":"Sainte-Marie River (Anticosti Island)"},{"id":"64865984","text":"Roosterville is an unincorporated settlement located to the north of the city of Liberty in Clay County, Missouri.

Population  The number of Nigerians in South Africa was estimated to be 24,000 in 2011. However, recent claims which has been viewed to be inflated suggest that the number is currently at 800,000. A more acceptable estimate will be 30,314 according to the 2016 Community Survey.  Migration history  The end of apartheid in 1994 saw a large migration of Nigerians to South Africa as businesses sought for professionals to immigrate.The love/hate relationship between Nigeria and South Africa NigeriaWorld.com, May 2008 However, the arrival of Nigerians to South Africa began to increase drastically in 2004 when monthly entries became 2,000 and then 4,000 in 2010. Ultimately, the entries of Nigerian Nationals from 2004 to 2010 were about 36,000. Among these increased migrants were entrepreneurs, high and middle skilled workers, students and dependents. Locations particularly occupied by Nigerians are Guateng, Kwazulu-Nata and Western Cape provinces.  Motivations  The demand for expatriates and skilled labor first spurred the migration of Nigerians to South Africa. Subsequently, there was more influx of movement to South Africa among Nigerians that sought for opportunities and a more conducive environment for their businesses. A considerable number of Nigerians that arrived South Africa were there for visitation. Others came in as students while some came seeking for asylum due to the activities of terrorists in Nigeria. About 1,000 to 3,000 Nigerians applied for asylum over the past ten years. However, these numbers do vary significantly by the year. Compared to the total number of people that apply for asylum in South Africa, these numbers only represent 1% of the total number. Which include people from Somalia, Ethiopia and the Congo. Among these set of individuals, 99.9% of Nigerian cases are rejected.  Business and employment  Nigerians tend to be making it in the job market from the level of unskilled workers to corporate workers as most of them possess qualifications that surpass that of South Africans. With degrees from universities like Harvard, Yale, Oxford and Cambridge, the competition is stiff and it is somewhat difficult for the other migrants and locals with degrees from indigenous universities to get the best paying jobs as the Nigerian foreigners. Pertaining to businesses, although there is no exact data to quantify this, restaurants, salons and bars are mostly run by Nigerians.  Social networks  Nigerian social networks seem to have spread from the urban neighborhoods where first generation Nigerians landed in South African cities in the mid-1990s. There has been a spread of Nigerians from the first few buildings in Hillbrow (Johannesburg) and Berea, Gauteng to other urban locations. So far, there are at least four Nigerian organizations in Johannesburg alone Which include the West Rand Nigerian Association, the Diamond Brothers Club (Randburg), the Nigerian Union of South Africa, the Egbe Omo Oodua (Yeoville). However, these organizations are on an ethno-regional basis of which the first two are particularly Igbo while the last to belong to the Yoruba tribe. These organizations carry out charitable activities towards fellow Nigerians and South Africans in South Africa. The Nigerian High Commission in South Africa honors certain South African based individuals which include Nigerian doctors, engineers, fashion designers and academics during award ceremonies. In addition, a large number of the places for socialization like bars, barber shops and restaurants are run by Nigerians. Recent qualitative research suggests that intermarriages do occur between Nigerian men and South African women.  Xenophobia and crime  The relationship between South Africa and Nigeria slowly became severed as a result of a trend that grew rapidly between 1994 and 1998. Some Nigerians were said to have ventured into organized crimes involving illegal drug trafficking. This generated a stereotypical view where Nigerians were portrayed by the South African media as criminals and a threat to the South African economic security. However, these widely accepted claims of criminal activities by Nigerians had no authentic evidences. The view of Nigerians as drug dealers, human traffickers and internet scammers, spurred attacks by South Africans on various occasions. The high qualification of most Nigerians which gave them better advantage in the job market thereby, making it difficult for the locals to get access to high paying jobs also contributed to the attacks as some unhappy bunch suggested that educated Nigerians could be making positive contributions back at home where there is clearly a need, instead of taking the top jobs from the hands of qualified South Africans. Recent Attacks took place in 2009, 2015 and 2019 leading to the deaths and injuries of many poor Nigerians. The pictures and videos of the attacks instigated violent reactions on South African businesses in Nigeria as many condemned the xenophobia phenomenon referring to it as an wrong payback for the help Nigeria offered South Africa during apartheid. However, the South African President Ramaphosa, made a public apology to Nigeria in 2019 through his envoy Jeff Radebe, stating that he was ashamed of the violence that had being demonstrated towards Nigerians. He said, \\"The incident does not represent what we stand for,\\" adding that South African police would \\"leave no stone unturned\\" in bringing those involved to justice. Ramaphosa, addressing the BBC, further said \\"We are very concerned and of course as a nation we [are] ashamed because this goes against the ethos of what South Africa stands for\\". President Buhari responded to the apologies from the South African president, pledging that the relationship between the two countries will be solidified,\\" a statement from his office said.  Evacuation  Apparently, there has been a level of evacuation of Nigerians from South Africa since 2019 as a result of the xenophobic attacks. The Nigerian government instigated the evacuation which led to hundreds of Nigerians leaving South Africa in 2019.

In Geneva, Victorine lived and attended First International meetings in Geneva before moving to Hungary to tutor. In 1874, with her husband released from prison, they returned to Geneva, where VIctorine worked as a shoemaker and participated in the Jura Federation and anarchists including Paul Brousse, Elisée Reclus, and Andrea Costa. Likely after the amnesty, she returned to Paris and served as a city delegate at the 1881 London Anarchist Congress. In London, she met Gustave Brocher. They married and raised several children. Victorine wrote for during this period. In 1883, she demonstrated with Louise Michel and Émile Pouget at Esplanade des Invalides. She continued to write for Le Cri du Peuple, La Lutte, and Le Drapeau noir. She trained in nursing following the 1884 death of Jean Rouchy. Brocher co-founded and taught at Louise Michel's international school in London since 1886. Brocher and her second husband relocated to Lausanne in 1892 where they operated a bookstore and youth boarding house until 1912. She published her memoirs, including her participation in the Paris Commune, in 1909. She also wrote for La Libre Fédération between 1915 and 1919. The couple lived in Fiume for two years, where her husband taught, and in Levallois-Perret. When Brocher became sick in 1921, they returned to Lausanne, where she died on November 21.

He was part of community assistance organizations for Haitians in America, cofounding the Haitian Refugee Center and serving on the board of the Haitian Education & Leadership Program. He also served as the managing director of Comcel Haiti from its founding in 1998 until its sale to Digicel in 2012. Early career and activism Bernard Fils-Aimé was the youngest of four children. His father, Camile Fils-Aimé, died soon after Bernard was born. His mother, Uranie Gabriel Fils-Aimé, was the directrice of the Republic of Guatemala Primary School in Petionville. She opposed François Duvalier, and was briefly arrested for criticizing his policies. Fils-Aimé and his family left Haiti for New York City in 1966. He graduated from John Jay High School in 1971, then studied at Columbia University for two years. He became involved in student activism, and remained active after he left the university. At a Haiti-related event for student organizers, Fils-Aimé met Marise Piverger; they married in 1980 despite her parents' disapproval, and moved to Miami. In Miami, Fils-Aimé co-founded the Haitian Refugee Center, which organized protests and litigated cases on behalf of detained Haitian refugees. Fils-Aimé later went back to school, completing his bachelor's degree and a Master of Public Administration from Florida International University. He worked in various administrative positions at Miami-Dade Community College: he was director of placement at the Wolfson campus, and later served as the assistant dean of students. Fils-Aimé was also a member of the Book Distribution Committee for the Miami Book Fair International in 1992, 1993, and 1995. Business in Haiti In 1995, Fils-Aimé moved back to Haiti, although he would regularly visit Miami. His first business venture was SabbAimé S.A., an importer and distributor of frozen chicken. Around this time, a group of American investors wanted to start a wireless carrier in Haiti, and approached Fils-Aimé to serve as a local partner. He helped negotiate the initial licenses for what would become Comcel, and became the first CEO. He recognized that Comcel faced unique hurdles as one of the few large private enterprises in Haiti. When subscribers complained of being unable to charge their phones, Fils-Aimé would let them charge their phones for free at Comcel headquarters. He also directed Comcel's resources toward philanthropic initiatives; when the company changed its name to Voila, Fils-Aimé became the president of the Voila Foundation. From 2006 to 2007, he served as the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Haiti. Fils-Aimé retired from Voila's management after its sale to Digicel in 2012. He then joined the board of the Haitian Education & Leadership Program. He also served as president of the Trilogy International Foundation, which is associated with Comcel's US parent company. Political involvement Fils-Aimé was a close friend of Haitian President Rene Preval. In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Fils-Aimé was critical of the Haitian government's plan to appropriate land for building aid camps; he observed that many political conflicts in Haiti had been triggered by land disputes. He also defended a private-sector-run opinion poll for the 2010–11 Haitian presidential election in the name of transparency, as previous such polls had not been publicly released. In 2019, Fils-Aimé published an op-ed in the Miami Herald decrying President Jovenel Moïse's responses to the 2018–2019 Haitian protests. The article was reprinted after the Herald erroneously attached a photograph of Reggie Fils-Aimé (the former CEO of the North American division of video game company Nintendo) instead of Bernard Fils- Aimé. Family Fils-Aimé and his wife Marise had three children: daughter Erica and sons Karl and Gerard. Death Fils-Aimé died of COVID-19 at the University of Miami Hospital on 8 August 2020.

It was established on vacant industrial land adjacent to a printing works and railway depot by Leeds City Council, and was majority financed by Carnegie. It is built to a design by Gilbert Burdett Howcroft. The Council closed the library in February 2016 due to its poor condition and being surplus to operational requirements. The building was listed at Grade II in 2017 and remains awaiting redevelopment. Description The central entrance in 2020, including entablature and pediment The disused building is located at 230 Cardigan Road, Leeds, and is flanked by student accommodation blocks and has a railway line with former coal drops to the rear, behind which is Burley Park. The library is of a single storey and basement, constructed of a mellow red brick with Portland stone and sandstone dressings, and uses a neo-Georgian style. The front elevation is of nine bays with a central bay that projects forward slightly to form the main entrance; square-panel double doors set within a classical doorcase with Greek key decoration and an entablature supported by carved consoles. Above the doorcase is a large stone with a carved inscription that reads 'BURLEY BRANCH', and above an Art Deco-style shallow pediment with an inscription reading 'CITY OF LEEDS/ PUBLIC LIBRARIES'. The three outer bays have windows with carved surrounds incorporating wave decoration to the sills and shallow flat hoods supported on carved consoles. The roof features roof lanterns over the flat- roofed sections of the entrance hall, junior room and reading room, but they hidden from view from the street by a parapet with flat copings. Along the whole front are painted cast iron railings incorporating narrow sections of guilloché-style detailing, which guard access to the window well and are included in the building's heritage listing. History Plaque in the library's entrance hall Burley was developed following the sale of the Cardigan estate in the 1860s. The branch library was established by the Leeds library system to serve the expanding local community. According to historical maps, the site was empty land in 1893, next to a railway depot. In 1908 the future site of the library was still vacant, although unlabelled industrial buildings had been built to the north. By 1921, a printing works was built to the south of the plot, with the future site of the library possibly forming an enclosed yard associated with the works. Access via leeds.gov.uk, within planning application 18/00122/LI. A contract for the construction of the library (dated March 1925) between Leeds Corporation and William Simpkiss of Lambourne and Company Ltd is held by the West Yorkshire Archive Service. A plaque inside the library attributes its design to the architect Gilbert Burdett Howcroft of Uppermill and gives a date of 15 June 1926 for its opening by Alderman Sir Percy Jackson, Chairman of the West Riding Education Committee, and a trustee of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust. The library cost £8,338 () to construct, with most of the funding coming from the Carnegie UK Trust and the rest from Leeds Council. The library was then in continual use until its closure by the local authority in February 2016. This was based on health and safety concerns arising from its general poor condition (especially non-compliance with fire regulations), an adjoining landowner having expressed a desire to acquire the property for incorporation with developments on adjacent sites, and the \\"limited potential for refurbishment or redevelopment in isolation\\". An August 2016 report from the authority recommended that the subject property be declared surplus to Council requirements with a view to a disposal at optimum value. Following its closure, the library was given a Grade II listing by Historic England in June 2017. Reasons for designation were cited as the design quality (\\"neo-Georgian design displays a careful attention to detail that belies its tiny scale\\"), the survival of original internal features, and being a \\"well-preserved example of a small inner-city branch library\\". An application for planning and listed building consent by Park Lane Group, a property developer with numerous student flats in the area, to refurbish the former library building as a co- working space and to build a five-storey rear extension of 60 co-living apartments was approved in 2019. A previous proposal to demolish the original building and erect a new five-storey residential building in its place was in development, but after the listing designation, was changed to a new design retaining the library. Access via leeds.gov.uk, within planning application 18/00122/LI. However, no building works have taken place as of August 2020.

After meeting at an art exhibition opening at the Bonython Gallery in Sydney in 1973, they established their fashion empire which consisted of the 'frock salon' and regular performances of the Flamingo Follies fashion parade. The salon operated in the Strand Arcade from 1973 until 1992. Clients were invited to 'step into paradise' and an 'explosion of shape and colour'. The Strand Arcade was home to a number of other fashion and beauty shops and Flamingo Park was seen as the 'go to' fashion store by many international visitors including Rudolph Nureyev, Monty Python comic Eric Idle and Mick Jagger. Other high-profile customers included Glenda Jackson, Susannah York, Garry Glitter, Cheech and Chong, Robert Hughes, Marcia Hines, Kate Fitzpatrick, Jacki Weaver and Alida Chase. Kee was recognised for her innovative designs in knitwear, although the actual hand knitting was carried out by Jan Ayres while Jackson mastered patchwork and applique techniques, favouring tafetta, crepe de chine, chiffon and georgette. They duo were adamant that they would maintain the quality of the fashions they produced, so prices consistently matched the amount of work that went into creating their unique designs, and there was no franchising or mass production. They were an interesting partnership who loved to travel and gathered together the many exotic influences they gathered in their travel. They were described as being 'compatible, yet with totally opposite personalities'. Kee was described as 'extroverted and effervescent', while Jackson was seen as 'quiet and ethereal'. They managed to ignore outside influences in their designs and created something that was seen as being uniquely Australian. In 1977 Flamingo Park won an Australian Lyrebird Award in the creative fashion category of 'The Innovators'. The Flamingo Park duo had created a purple silk taffeta fantasy dress. In 1982 Jackson had branched out into a new business venture and created businesses Bush Couture and Bush Kids while Kee remained in the Strand Arcade until 1992. In 2018 Kee and Jackson were made Officers of the Order of Australia for their services to Australia's fashion industry. In 2019, the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney staged the Step Into Paradise exhibition of the designs and fashions of Kee and Jackson and within the exhibition recreated the 're-imagined' salon that had been Flamingo Park. For a generation of women this re-creation brought back memories of the colour and energy that was encountered when walking through the doors of the salon and into a world that was an 'explosion of shape and colour'. The duo had a 'dynamic creative energy' that has had lasting influence on fashion and design in Australia for decades.

The region is one of wet evergreen forests, with rain over 50 mm in every month. The forests have been highly degraded by human use, and the high levels of biodiversity have been pushed back into relatively small protected areas like Pu Mat National Park.  Location and description  The region is about 380 km from north to south, and about 50 km wide on average. It is bounded by the coast on the east, and the Northern Annamites rain forests to the west. The geological base features extensive limestone ('karst') mountains and valleys. Elevations range from sea level to 1,000 meters, with an average of 88 meters. The primary wet evergreen forest has mostly been cleared in the past by humans; by one estimate only 10% of the original remains.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month. Annual rainfall increases towards the south, averaging 1,500 mm in the north near Hanoi, and reaching 3,000 mm in the south near Huế. The wet seasons centers on September to January.  Flora and fauna  The original wet evergreen forest has been mostly broken up by human agriculture and use, and now exists in scattered patches. Over the ecoregion as a whole, only 28% is currently under forest cover; 31% is under agricultural cultivation. The primary forest that exists exhibits a three-tiered canopy rising 25-35 meters. The highest tier is dominated by trees of the Hopea genus, Castanopsis hystrix, and Madhuca pasquieri. A common sub-canopy tree is the Taraw palm (Livistona saribus), used for thatching on huts. The ecoregion supports some rare animals, including the largest viable population of the critically endangered Northern white-cheeked gibbon (living in Pu Mat National Park), the critically endangered Red-shanked douc, and populations of Gray langurs (a genus of Old world monkey).  Protected areas  Officially protected areas in the ecoregion include: * Cúc Phương National Park, at the northern end of the region was Vietnam's first national park and still its largest nature reserve. * Pu Mat National Park, a rugged and remote area of great biodiversity (2,461 plant species identified) on the east slope of the northern Annamite Range. * Bến En National Park, in the north, is popular with tourists for it large lake (), caves and nature trails. * Bạch Mã National Park, sitting on steep slopes of granite mountains (to 1,250 meters) near Huế, Bach Ma is in the transition zone between northern and southern Vietnam plant communities.

After his studies at Sciences Po, he entered the Grand Séminaire in Quimper before continuing his training at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Institut Catholique de Paris, earning a degree in theology. He finished his studies at the Institut des sciences sociales du travail de Paris. On 6 April 1953, he was ordained as a priest in the Diocese of Quimper.Diocese of Vannes After having been a vicar in Landerneau, Gourvès became a diocesan chaplain with the Young Christian Workers from 1957 to 1967. In 1969, he was sent to the Saint-Sauveur church in Brest until 1975. Gourvès was consecrated as Bishop of Vannes on 24 February 1991 and subsequently added François to his first name. He officially became Bishop on 16 November 1991, succeeding Pierre Boussard, the same man who had ordained him. In 1996, Bishop Gourvès joined multiple diocesan radio stations, including Radio chrétienne francophone. That same year, he was at the welcoming of Pope John Paul II, who was the first Pope to set foot in Brittany. John Paul II gave a speech in Sainte- Anne-d'Auray, the only known place where Saint Anne, grandmother of Jesus Christ, had appeared. The speech marked 27 years as Pope for John Paul II, and was one year prior to World Youth Day in France. In 2005, following the consecration of his successor, Raymond Centène, he retired to his hometown of Plougastel-Daoulas. In 2015, he moved to Sainte-Anne-d'Auray.

Education and early career  Monteith was born on April 12, 1848, in McIndoes Falls, Vermont, the son of William R. Monteith, a prominent local citizen, and Isabel Gilchrist. Earning his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College in 1869, Monteith served in 1869–71 as the principal of McIndoes Academy, of which he was an alum and his father a trustee. He then moved to New York City, where he passed the bar exam and practiced law for several years. Returning to Vermont, he again became principal of McIndoes Academy in 1877. Monteith served in that position for two years before moving to Connecticut, where he was principal of Farmington High School from 1879 to 1899. He lived in Farmington for the rest of his life, commuting and staying overnight in Storrs three days a week.  Connecticut Agricultural College  In 1900, Monteith was recruited to teach history, literature, and languages at Connecticut Agricultural College by college president George Washington Flint, who was Monteith's brother-in-law. He taught various subjects: in 1903, he was listed as a professor of history, civics, Latin, and mathematics; in 1906, Latin was dropped from the curriculum; in 1914, his title was professor of history and French; in 1916, his subjects were English and French. He retired in 1919 but continued to teach up until the time of his death. When he retired, Monteith was named emeritus professor of history – the first faculty member of the college to receive the emeritus designation. Contemporaries described \\"Monty\\" as the \\"grand old man\\" of Connecticut Agricultural College. Popular among students, for many years Monteith served as faculty advisor to UConn's Daily Campus student newspaper and as teacher and mentor to generations of students. In 1921–22, female students convened the Monteith Arts Society \\"for the purpose of promoting an interest in literature and arts.\\"  Death and legacy  Monteith married Ella Ryder in New York City in 1873. They had two daughters: Isabel, a violinist and teacher at the Hartford Conservatory, and Marjorie, who scored the first goal at UConn's first-ever women's basketball game and captained the team. Marjorie married Robert K. Vibert, a Panama City merchant. Monteith died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage in the campus dining hall on March 21, 1922. He was survived by his wife and daughters. His portrait, painted by Harold Green in Robert Brandegee's studio and completed around the time of Monteith's death, is held by the William Benton Museum of Art. Opened in 1959 and renovated in 2016, the Monteith Building on UConn's Storrs campus is named in his honor.

He notably devised a plot to overthrow Carol II, King of Romania, a plan that would later be taken over by Legionary leader and later Co- Conducator Horia Sima. Cantacuzino was killed on September 22, 1939, at the prison in Râmnicu Sărat, during a retaliation operation ordered by Carol II following the assassination of Prime Minister Armand Călinescu.  Biography  Prince Alexandru Cantacuzino was born in 1901 in the commune of Ciocănești, Ilfov county, in the Ghica-Cantacuzino mansion, today a historical monument. He was a descendant of the Ghica family, a noble family active in the 17th to 19th centuries in current-day Romania (then Wallachia, Moldavia, and the Kingdom of Romania). He studied in Paris and then at the Hague Academy of International Law, obtaining a bachelor's degree, and later in Bucharest where he received a doctorate of law. He opted for a diplomatic career, beginning as chief of staff at the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1926-1927), then as secretary of legation and head of Romanian affairs in the Hague and Warsaw. Attracted by emerging far-right and fascist politics in Romania, Cantacuzino began contributing to the Bucharest-based Legionary newspaper, Axa, then edited by notable far-right figures such as Ion Moța, Vasile Cristescu, Alexandru Constant, Mihail Polihroniade, and Mircea Eliade. He also contributed writings to magazines Convorbiri literare, Cuvântul studențesc, Vestitorii, and Libertatea.  Political activity  Public activity = Cantacuzino joined the Legionary Movement, also known as the Iron Guard or the Legion of the Archangel Michael, and became one of the closest collaborators of the \\"Căpitanul\\", Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, who awarded him the highest rank in the Legionary hierarchy, \\"Commander of the Good News\\" (\\"Comandant al Bunei Vestiri\\"). He came to the attention of the state authorities after participating in the organization of the Student Congresses in Craiova (April 1935) and in Târgu Mureș (April 1936), which culminated in demonstrations and serious disturbances of public order. The congress in Craiova focused dominantly on the “affirmation of the Legionary faith” on the part of students, and the subsequent congress in Târgu Mureș was much more aggressive, openly denouncing the so-called \\"occult forces\\" (supposedly Jews) that led Romanian politics and were responsible for the persecution of Legionary students. Elena Lupescu, the Jewish mistress and later wife of Carol II, was specifically targeted at this congress, alongside Virgil Madgearu, General Gabriel Marinescu, and later Prime Minister Armand Călinescu, whom Legionary students believed to be conspiring to assassinate Codreanu. Cantacuzino was, according to Horia Sima's later recollection, one of the most virulent speakers to appear before the congress. In 1936, Cantacuzino left with the legionary team led by General Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul to fight in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Franco-led Nationalist faction. He was later decorated with the \\"Red Cross\\" by Franco for his participation. On 17 May 1937, Cantacuzino was sentenced to one year in prison due to his role at the Târgu Mures Student Congress. In 1937 Cantacuzino was appointed head of the \\"Moța-Marin Legionary Corps\\", set up on orders of Codreanu shortly before the group of Legionnaires left for the Spanish front. This Legionary Corps was to serve as Codreanu's personal guard. It was later intended to be transformed into the elite defence corps of the Legionary movement, \\"a group of strictly and severely educational essence and heroic inspiration,\\" consisting of 10,033 \\"fighters\\" under 30 years of age. The intended transformation of this organization was never realized, as the \\"Everything for the Country\\" Party, the electoral front of the Legionary movement, was disbanded with the establishment of a royal dictatorship and the prohibition of any form of political activity. With the encouragement of Codreanu, Cantacuzino ran in the elections of 20-22 December 1937, representing the \\"Everything for the Country\\" Party in Arad County. He succeeded in achieving one of the highest vote counts obtained by the Legionaries, receiving 32.73% of the vote, and became deputy of Argeș. = Clandestine activity = On the eve of the establishment of the Royal Dictatorship of Carol II, Armand Călinescu, then serving as Minister of the Interior, issued Order no. 746 of 6 March 1938, ordering all police prefectures and gendarmerie to keep files on Legionnaires and, if they did not comply with the new legislation prohibiting political activity, to arrest them. Theoretically, it was aimed at suppressing any form of political activity, but practically, according to Legionary historian Ilarion Țiu, this order was largely abused, mainly with traps set by the authorities (circulars, orders, and false communiqués issued by the Ministry of Interior in guise of official Legionary bulletins). This order would serve as justification of the later arrest and assassination of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Following Order 746, a wave of arrests of Codreanu's collaborators was launched. On the night of 16-17 April 1938, Corneliu Codreanu and 44 other Legionary leaders were arrested. Cantacuzino was arrested but managed to escape together with Vasile Cristescu, jumping from the window of the train transporting them from the Miercurea Ciuc camp to Jilava prison.DANIC, fond DGP, dosar nr. 15/1938, f. 183 After their escape, somewhere near Brașov,DANIC, fond DGP, dosar nr. 252/1939, f. 56 the two split up, Cristescu hiding in Brașov and Cantacuzino in Bucharest, where the latter had numerous relatives holding high positions in Romanian public society, preventing authorities from searching their residences.DANIC, fond DGP, dosar nr. 15/1938, f. 184 Codreanu was sentenced to 10 years of forced labor, and the trial of the other Legionary leaders followed. Initially, they were promised to be released in exchange for a pledge of allegiance to Carol II's leadership.DANIC, DGP fund, file no. 15/1938, pp. 133. However, every one of the arrestees refused, believing that the European turn towards far-right and fascist leadership would cause them to be released earlier than anticipated. The trial of Legionary leaders began on 25 July 1938 at the Military Tribunal of the Second Army Corps, with the sentence being pronounced on 1 August 1938. Alexandru Cantacuzino and Vasile Cristescu, having escaped, were sentenced to 9 years in prison, whereas the other detainees received a sentence of only 7 years.DANIC, DGP fund, file no. 262/1940, pp. 86 Due to this wave of arrests, the Legionary movement lacked its entire senior leadership and was now unable to function. Thus, new leaders came to power, including Horia Sima, Cantacuzino, and Vasile Critescu. Sima, who had been serving as a provincial leader, replaced Codreanu in the hierarchy of leadership, organizing a \\"Persecution Command\\" (\\"Comandament de prigoană\\").DANIC, fond DGP, dosar nr. 252/1939, f. 210. Sima then reorganized the movement, limiting the number of a \\"nest\\" (the term used for a local Legionary outpost or club) to 5 members and giving each nest greater autonomy and ability to launch actions. Thus, within a few months following the April 1938 wave of arrests, Legionary nests were able to organize under conditions of secrecy, launching a number of manifestos and publications against Armand Călinescu and Prime Minister Nicolae Iorga, who they saw as responsible for the conviction of Codreanu.DANIC, DGP fund, file no. 11/1938, pp. 224. Publications such as \\"The Truth About the Trial of Corneliu Z. Codreanu, May 1938\\" and manifestos against the Royal Dictatorship were also printed, with Sima's Persecution Command directly addressing letters to the authorities. On 13 October 1938, Alexandru Cantacuzino released a circular declaring that \\"the Legionary Movement is determined to put an end to Mr. Călinescu's fearlessness.\\" A pamphlet, entitled \\"Look at These Three\\" (\\"Priviți pe acești trei\\") followed, directly attacking Carol II, Elena Lupescu, and her father. Another manifesto followed, commanding Carol II to \\"reconcile with the Romanian Nation\\", lest the Legionaries \\"find another solution to the open problem\\". In his later memoirs, Horia Sima noted that these manifestos received greater recognition as they were personally signed by Legionary leaders. During this time, Cantacuzino began to plot to overthrow Carol II, a plan later modified and realized by Horia Sima. On 28 October 1938, Cantacuzino was arrested while walking through Bucharest disguised as an officer. He was imprisoned in the Râmnicu Sărat prison along with the Legionary leaders convicted in the trial of 25 July 1938, namely Gheorghe Clime, Mihail Polihroniade, Traian Cotigă, and Șerban Milcoveanu, among others.  Death  After refusing to sign a declaration of submission and allegiance to the authorities, Cantacuzino was shot on the night of 21-22 September 1939. The remaining Legionary leaders imprisoned in Râmnicu Sărat were also shot, including Gheorghe Clime, Aurel Serafim, Nicolae Totu, Gheorghe Istrate, Sima Simulescu, Cristian Tell, Gheorghe Furdui, Mihail Polihroniade, Paul Craja, and Gheorghe Apostolescu. The list of those to be shot was reportedly drawn up by Armand Călinescu, alongside police prefect Gavrilă Marinescu and Mihail Moruzov, Romanian intelligence director. Alexandru Cantacuzino was buried in the Legionary Cemetery in Predeal. Following the rise to power of Ion Antonescu and Horia Sima on 14 September 1940 (a regime known as the National Legionary State), the 1938 arrest and trial was revised by Decision no. 4 of 21 November 1940 of the Commission for the Review of Political Processes, at which point 19 Legionary leaders, including Alexandru Cantacuzino (second on the list), were acquitted of their sentences.

He was hitchhiking from Pedro Luro to Bahía Blanca, when in the town entrance of Mayor Buratovich was stopped in a police checkpoint of circulation permits. His last known image, taken the day of disappearance, depicts him being hold by the police for violating the lockdown, with his hands against the police vehicle number RO 23360. It was cataloged by the victim family as a Forced disappearance in hands of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police. This theory was also followed by human rights activist Estela de Carlotto. Nora Cortiñas, another known activist in Argentina, demanded the resignation of Sergio Berni, the Buenos Aires Province Minister of Security. The minister considered this an irresponsible request. The UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances (OHCHR) demanded the Argentine government to be expedite and through in the investigation, as well as to take any possible hypothesis in consideration. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also issued a precautionary measure. The President of Argentina, during a radio interview, stated: \\"We need to know what happened to Facundo. I want us to find him and, if someone was responsible for an illicit act, they will have to face the consequences\\". The investigation started under the legal title of Whereabouts inquiry but then turned to a Forced disappearance investigation. In August, the involvement of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team in the investigation was required. His body remains were found on August 15, 2020, in an advanced state of decomposition, in an area between the cities of General Daniel Cerri and Villarino Viejo. The autopsy was done in the former ESMA in Buenos Aires, where the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team has its laboratory. 15 experts from different areas participated in the exam, which lasted for 10 hours. The autopsy report, published by the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, established the cause of death as drowning while the manner of death as an unnatural death, but it couldn't be established whether it was a result of homicide, suicide, or an accident. Algae matching the one sampled in the discovery place was found in the body.  Disappearance  On 30 April 2020, Facundo Astudillo Castro left his house in Pedro Luro to Bahía Blanca (both cities located in the Buenos Aires Province) to visit his ex-girlfriend, trying to get back together. At this time the country was under a strict lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, which required eligible persons to travel a permit to do so, and punished those who violated the regulation. He did not have this permit, and traveled hitchhiking. At around 13 hours, the young man called his mother, stating: \\"Mom, you have no idea where am I at, you'll never see me again\\". On the same day, two Mayor Buratovich policemen intercepted the young man and made him a ticket for lockdown violation. The Astudillo family locates this at about 10 hours. As the police stopped him, they took his last known picture, which depicts him being hold by the police for violating the lockdown, with his hands against the police pickup number RO 23360. A photo of his driver license was later taken. He was later stopped at another police check for permits in the town entrance of Teniente Origone. Three witnesses claim to have seen Facundo around 3:30 p.m. in that area when two province policemen, in a Toyota Hilux pickup truck with its rear door open, supposedly stopped him and told him to get on. However, the prosecutor does not consider this enough grounds to establish that Facundo was kidnapped by the police, citing among other reasons than an officer (Alberto González) claims to have intercepted the disappeared young man around 26 kilometres further on Route 3 than what the location mentioned by the witnesses, and he took a picture of his driver's license (photo which is on record in the case file). This officer claims to have questioned Facundo, who told him he was en route to Bahía Blanca and did not had the circulation permit required. After becoming aware of this, the officer stated he radioed the Médanos police station about what to do, and he was told to let the young man go. In his statement, the police officer said that the young man kept on in a light grey Renault Duster Oroch.  Investigation  On the 5th of July, a formal missing persons report was entered, which was assigned to Rodolfo De Lucía, head of the 20th UFI in Bahía Blanca. The family of the disappeared criticized police action, pointing out how hard they made to file the report, and the fact that the Police took note of one of Facundo's friends testimonial on a deli piece of paper. On June 17, Cristina Castro (mother of Facundo) reached out to Mayor Buratovich to witness a police operation, but five trucks of the Buenos Aires police blocked her. On June 25, the Federal System for the Search of Lost and Missing Persons became aware of the case and reported it to police and government agencies across the country through the systems of the federal Ministry of Security. On the 8th of July, the Person Search division of the Federal Police joined the search. Resources were also requested from other federal forces. This same day, the police watch log book of Mayor Buratovich was seized, as well as several policemen's mobile phones. Also on July 8, federal judge Gabriel Marrón took on the case, with the investigation being taken by prosecutor Santiago Ulpiano Martínez. The Buenos Aires provincial police was removed from the investigation as it was under suspicions, and Adolfo Pérez Esquivel and Roberto Cipriano García (members of the Provincial Commission on Memory) were accepted as plaintiffs. On July 11, and by request of the Provincial Commission on Memory, an UN committee demanded the Argentinian State an \\"expedite and through\\" investigation. The government of that time informed the UN their absolute commitment to the investigation. On July 12, during a Buenos Aires police procedure looking for human remains in a Mayor Buratovich Landfill, the family attorney was threatened by a police deputy commissioner. Then, at the prosecutor's request, the provincial police left the scene to the federal police. No human remains were found that day. The deputy commissioner was discharged by order of Internal Affairs. Between the 14 and 15 of July, 200 members of the Federal Police, the Naval Prefecture and the National Gendarmerie conducted cross country and air search between Pedro Luro and Bahía Blanca, in an area near to the National Route 3. On 15 July, a forensic examination was conducted on police vehicles, in search of physical and biological traces, including blood and other DNA samples. Forensics on the policemen mobile phones using Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED) technology were requested, as well as an analysis on the Mayor Buratovich police station logbook, looking for any kind of manipulation to hide the detention of Facundo in that station. Stains compatible with blood residue were found on the trunk of a police officer's personal vehicle and, on police pickup truck number 22788, stains on the glove compartment, back seat and rear cargo box, as well as minor stains on the steering wheel. On 17 July, Facundo's mobile provider informed that around 19 hours on March the 30th, pings from the Facebook app were sent by the disappeared's phone. This was registered by two sites, one located in the National Route 3, and the other in the Bahía Blanca petrochemical pole. On 21 July, the disappeared's mother made a substitution request on the federal prosecutor, Santiago Ulpiano Martínez, citing wrongdoings in the June 19th search, such as contacting the Buenos Aires province police (which was at the moment already taken off the investigation) and data leaks published on Facebook. Between the 25 and 27 of July, a new search was made, comprising the area between the entrance to the Villarino partido (department) and the Aguará train station. It also covered a part of National Route 3, and involved the use of canine units, Federal Police drones and tactical divers from the National Prefecture. On July 29, federal judge María Gabriela Marrón denied the request for prosecutor substitution, on the ground of considering it procedurally incorrect. On the 31 of July, a new search using canine units was performed in the Teniente Origone precint, where in an abandoned cellblock an object that could belong to Facundo was found. His mother claims it was gifted to him by his grandmother. On August the 7th, and by request of the disappeared's family, new searches using canine units were performed in Mayor Buratovich, around the 780-kilometre mark of National Route 3. Burnt bone remains were found, which at the moment of the search could not be determined to belong to any person in particular. The young man's family belongs he was taken into a police patrol in the whereabouts of this finding. On August 8, it was revealed that the girlfriend and the brother of the disappeared had been threatened by the Buenos Aires provincial policemen in search of a confession, as well as that an illegal raid had been carried out at the family's home. The prosecutor said that these actions, despite being qualified as felony, actually exposed the will of the police to find the young man, more than being indicative of a cover-up. The disappeared's family made a second substitution request on the federal prosecutor, Santiago Ulpiano Martínez, on the 8th of August after he denied an arrest request on several policemen. The prosecutor's office bought a new SIM from Claro with the disappeared young man's number, to be analyzed by the Federal Police. With this SIM card, the police entered to Facundo's WhatsApp account from a fresh cellphone.  Suspects  Since the disappearance, four Buenos Aires provincial policemen are suspected, due to changes and contradictions in their statements. Despite the family requests on their arrest, the prosecutors office considers (as of August 13) that there is not enough evidence to jail the policemen.

Buckaroo was the Leading sire in North America of 1985. Background Buckaroo was bred in Kentucky by Greentree Stud and raced for Greentree Stable as a homebred. He was sired by Buckpasser, a Hall of Fame racehorse whose immense influence on the breed came mainly as a broodmare sire. Buckaroo's dam, Stepping High, was a stakes-placed daughter of No Robbery. Racing career Buckaroo made three starts at age two, earning one win in a maiden special weight race at Belmont Park. He made ten starts at age three, recording four wins including the Grade II Saranac Stakes and Grade III Peter Pan Stakes. He was also second in the Dwyer and Whitney Handicaps. At age four, he finished out of the money in five starts. Stud record In 1980, Buckaroo was retired to stud at Greentree Stud in Kentucky. For the 1985 breeding season, he was relocated to Happy Valley in Florida. He was subsequently moved to the Florida Stallion Station for the 1991 season, and finished his breeding career at Bridlewood Farm. Buckaroo sired 539 named foals, of which 350 (64.9%) were winners and 29 (5.4%) were stakes winners. Spend a Buck, winner of the Kentucky Derby winner, was his most successful offspring, and helped him become the leading sire in North America of 1985. His most successful sons at stud were Spend a Buck and Montbrook. In 2004, he was designated as a brilliant/intermediate chef-de-race. He died in July 1996 due to kidney failure.

The battalion would see service during the initial stages of the conflict, but the lineage ended after being amalgamated with two volunteer battalions to form a demi-brigade. The battalion's successor, the 85éme Régiment d'Infanterie continued to serve in the modern French Army until 1940 when it was disbanded following the Battle of France.  Formation  The Chasseurs du Gèvaudan was formed in and was to recruit exclusively from troops of the Gévaudan region of Languedoc. The new battalion was organised from the infantry companies of the Chasseurs à Cheval du Gèvaudan, and grouped Berghes, where it established its headquarters. The battalion was placed 10th in precedence of the chassuers, after the Chasseurs des Cévennes and before the Chasseurs des Ardennes.Susane, Volume I, pp. 311, 313–314, 364, 369, 399, 404.Susane, Volume VII, pp. 387–388. The regiment's first uniform consisted of; black tricone (officers in bicorne), crimson collar, dark green turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, dark green pockets, crimson cuff flaps, crimson cuffs, and white buttons.Lienhart & Humbet, pp. 57–58.Smith, Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 42–47. Regimental uniform after the 1791 provisional regulations, showing the new casque helmet. In late 1788 the battalion moved to Landrecies and Bouchain before moving to Maubeuge in early 1791.  Revolution  On 1 April 1791, provisional regulations were announced following the initial stages of the French Revolution, and the regiment renamed as the 10éme Bataillon de Chasseurs (Cévennes), but they continued to be known as their former title until 1792. In addition to the new title, the regiment adopted a new uniform; peak casque, with stiff black horsehair crest and mock leopard skin turban helmet, crimson collar, dark green turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, dark green pockets, crimson cuff flaps, crimson cuffs, and white buttons.  War of the First Coalition  In 1792 the battalion joined the vanguard of the Army of the North Armée du Nord and contributed to the Flanders campaign. After the campaign, the battalion returned to Valenciennes, and after the Battle of Neerwinden it joined the forefront of the Army of General de Dampierre. In early April 1793, the battalion allowed itself (somehow) to be surprised by the Austrians and the majority of the battalion captured or slaughtered. In October, under general Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, the battalion marched to the aide of Maubeuge where it stood out extremely well in the battalions fought around the centre of the château (castle). On 7 October 1793, the battalion captured the Redoubt of the Wolf Redoute du Loup from the Hungarians, where panic and terror seized a battalion of volunteers of the Eure and fled. The chasseurs, indignant, took off the tie from the flag of the cowards, and remained on the redoubt until that evening. The years following the Revolution saw great changes for the French Army: the old royalist infantry regiments were to serve as the stiffening for the tens of thousands of new volunteers who answered the patriotic Levée en masse. In the First Amalgamation of 1794, each old royalist battalion was put together with two new volunteers battalions to become new Demi-Brigade de Bataille or Demi-Brigade of Battle. Therefore, on 24 February 1795, the battalion amalgamated with the 16th Battalion of Chasseurs (Légion du Centre) and 1st Battalion of the Legion of the Moselle to form the 10éme Demi-Brigade Légère, thus ending the royalist lineage and traditions.

He retired in January 1957 over heart problems and died six years later.  Biography  Ramey was born in Sulphur Springs, Texas. He attended North Texas Teachers College and aspired to practice medicine, but was persuaded to compete in the examination for a place in West Point by his captain in the National Guard. He was enrolled at West Point in 1924 and graduated as a second lieutenant in 1928. After his graduation, Ramey enrolled in the Air Corps Primary Flying School and graduated from the Air Corps Advanced Flying School in September 1929. He served with the 27th Pursuit Squadron in Michigan for a time and in 1932 was made commanding officer of the 38th Pursuit Squadron. Later he served as a flight instructor in Randolph Field, Texas. In January 1942 during United States' involvement in World War II, Ramey became plans and training officer of the VII Bomber Command. The next month he was promoted to Colonel. In October 1942 he transferred to the Fifth Air Force, in which he served as commanding officer of 43rd Bomb Group and 314th Bomb Wing.  Postwar service  At Operation Crossroads in 1946, Ramey was the director of the \\"Able\\" shot and commander of Task Force 1.5. Ramey assumed command of the Eighth Air Force as a temporary Brigadier General in January 1947. He was responsible for reversing the stance on the nature of the crashed craft of the Roswell UFO incident later that year. He was famously photographed with a telex in his hand on 8 July 1947 that Ufologists believe may confirm a cover-up. The photograph has been subject to much analyzing with little conclusive results. In May 1954 Ramey assumed command of the Fifth Air Force in Korea. He retired on 31 January 1957 over heart problems, having been promoted to temporary Lieutenant General in June 1954.

Known for his advocacy of a bilateral nuclear weapons freeze, he was associated with the so-called Malibu Mafia who donated to liberal and progressive causes and politicians. Willens provided the Malibu base of the group by hosting meetings at his house on Malibu Beach. Willins co-founded the military reform Center for Defense Information in 1972. In 1978, he served on the United Nations Disarmament Commission. In 1982, Willens headed Proposition 12, a successful California ballot initiative calling for a bilateral nuclear weapons freeze between the US and the Soviet Union. Early life Willens was born in the northern Chernigov region of Ukraine on April 26, 1914, the son of a tailor and a garment worker. He and his Jewish family barely escaped death in the Kiev pogroms (1919), and in 1922 they settled as refugees in the US, initially in the Bronx. His sister Doris Willens was born in 1924. The family moved to Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, in 1927. In 1932, Willens graduated from Roosevelt High School. He took a job at a food market to help support his family during the Great Depression. He started a food business with his wife Grace. Leaving much of the business to her, he enrolled in English literature classes at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Willens graduated from UCLA with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1939. World War II Willens volunteered to serve in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. He was taught to read, write and speak the Japanese language, and was sent to the Pacific War as a translator and interpreter. At the rank of captain, his service included a year in Japan during the occupation, interpreting for the local people and the occupying forces. He was shocked by the devastation of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While on occupation duty, Willens was approached by a Japanese man who asked him to locate and guard his family's heirloom samurai swords to preserve them from being destroyed – all Japanese weapons in the Kumamoto area had been confiscated by occupying forces to prevent armed violence. Willens eventually found the four swords in storage, and displayed them in his California home during the 1950s and 1960s, hanging on the wall of his den. At home in 1973, while preparing to visit China on business, he abruptly decided to stop in Japan to return the vintage swords to their rightful owner in Kumamoto. He inquired ahead to locate the owner, who was now 60 years old. Willens and his family were met at the airport with a television news crew who had learned of the repatriation of the katanas. Willens formally handed the ornate swords to their grateful Japanese owner on a morning television program. The occasion was heralded in Japan as a healing of the wounds of war. Business dealings Willens bought two modest grocery stores on the outskirts of Wilshire Boulevard before he left for war. After he returned, the Wilshire business district expanded to include his properties, and he became a millionaire after a few years. He parlayed these holdings into a real estate fortune, including whole blocks of Wilshire commercial property. Willens also provided textile machinery to factories through his privately owned business, the Factory Equipment Supply Corp. In 1989, Willens teamed with businessman Wesley Bilson to assist entrepreneurs in the newly opened Soviet Union. One of the projects was the transformation of a Leningrad military base into a factory making children's clothing. Raisa Gorbacheva was supportive of the mission. In Washington, D.C., California Representative Mel Levine spoke in favor, saying that such joint deals will help to \\"lessen the tensions that exist between our two countries.\\" Political donations In 1961, Willens was inspired to begin donating money to charitable causes, after listening to Aldous Huxley and other speakers at Hutchins Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. He donated $50,000 in 1968 to help anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy run for president, and he was able to convince ten other businessmen to do the same. Willens was a central member of the casual group known as the Malibu Mafia. He helped fund the failed 1972 presidential campaign of George McGovern, who was running as the anti-war candidate, opposing the Vietnam War. Willens also served as a Democratic Party delegate from California at the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1975, Willens urged his wealthy friends to form the Energy Action Committee (EAC), initially funded with $500,000 for the purpose of countering the political power of Big Oil. Willens hosted many political meetings at his Malibu home, including one attended by Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Neil Diamond and Warren Beatty. Nuclear weapons freeze In 1968, Willens founded the Businessmen's Educational Fund to reduce the influence of the defense industry on government policy, to stop the nuclear arms race. Newspapers called him a \\"flaming moderate\\" for his relatively conservative style of progressive activism. In 1972, he co-founded the Center for Defense Information, a nonprofit group composed of retired military officers who aim for military reform. Willens was convinced that Jimmy Carter would work to halt the arms race, and so he donated his time and money to Carter's campaign in the 1976 United States presidential election. Willens and Carter discussed nuclear weapons reductions at length; the two became close. After Carter won, Willens and Paul Newman were invited to dine at the White House where Carter \\"made certain commitments\\", according to Willens. Willens was appointed by Carter to the United Nations Disarmament Commission which met in New York in 1978. Willens felt betrayed when Carter declined to speak or even appear at the conference, undermining its purpose. After that, Willens abandoned Carter, saying \\"My candidate for president is the nuclear freeze.\\" This catalyzed Willens to rethink the Nuclear Freeze movement as a citizens' effort. He joined in 1979 with Reverend George F. Regas and Rabbi Leonard Beerman to form the Interfaith Center to Reverse the Arms Race. In 1981, Willens started a bilateral nuclear freeze movement in California, to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the US and the USSR. In 1982, Willens created Californians for a Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze to put a nuclear freeze ballot initiative in front of California voters. The proposal was not asking for nuclear reduction or disarmament; rather, it suggested a stop to further expansion, with California to ask the federal government to \\"immediately halt the testing, production and further deployment of all nuclear weapons, missiles and delivery systems in a way that can be checked and verified by both sides.\\" Actor Paul Newman attracted publicity by announcing his support. In January 1982, Willens spoke before Congress on the topic of nuclear freeze. By October, about $1.8 million had been spent on the campaign, with most of it from Willens. Willens later said that $4 million was raised in total. California voters passed Proposition 12 in November 1982 with a 'yes' vote of 51 percent, directing Governor Jerry Brown to communicate to the federal government California's consensus against nuclear weapons increases. Brown was unable to elicit a response from President Ronald Reagan, nor was Senator Alan Cranston. Willens himself eventually met with Reagan through his daughter Michele's friendship with the president's rebellious daughter, Patti, who placed a call to her father and then handed the phone to Willens. At the White House, Reagan was dismissive, telling Willens that the Soviets were ahead in the nuclear arms race, that the US should catch up before a freeze could be considered. Willens argued that the Soviets could be destroyed several times over by the current US stockpile, but Reagan was not moved. Willens published a book in 1984, The Trimtab Factor, which details how wealthy donors can stop the nuclear arms race. The name of the book comes from a mechanical trim tab on a boat or airplane, designed to make it easer to change direction while in motion. Willens picked up the concept from Buckminster Fuller. Willens established a scholarly fellowship at The Nation magazine, called the Harold Willens Peace Fellow. Jonathan Schell was awarded the fellowship in 1998. Personal life Willens lived in Santa Monica, California, during the 1960s, and was president of the Beverly Hills Tennis Club, organizing Pancho Segura Day in 1966 to raise money for the club's tennis pro. He moved to Malibu in the 1970s, to live on the beach in a two-story home in the affluent community known as \\"The Colony\\" on Malibu Point. He had two sons and one daughter: Larry, Ron and Michele. Later in life, he shifted between the Malibu house, a condo in Rancho Mirage where he played tennis with Spiro Agnew, and a third residence in Brentwood, Los Angeles. He was a Jewish atheist. Regarding political contributions, he once said, \\"there is a widely held myth that... the potential contributor... has a certain number of dollars... and if someone else takes the dollars away, I won't get it... [A contribution] works just the opposite... it opens them up. It's a catalytic agent on the generosity, and then they tend to give more and more and more.\\" Willens died of heart failure at his home in Brentwood on March 17, 2003, at the age of 88.
