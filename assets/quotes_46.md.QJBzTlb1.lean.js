History Kremsm√ºnster Abbey Church The monastery was founded in 777 by Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria. According to the foundation legend, Tassilo founded the monastery on the site where his son, Gunther, had been attacked and killed by a wild boar during a hunting trip. The first colony of monks came from Lower Bavaria, under Fateric, the first abbot. The new foundation received generous endowments from the founder and also from Charlemagne and his successors. The position and reputation of the abbey soon became such that its abbots, in the absence of the bishop of the diocese (Passau), exercised the episcopal jurisdiction. In the 10th century the abbey was destroyed in a raid by the Hungarians, and its possessions were divided among the Duke of Bavaria and other nobles and the bishops. It was restored, however, and recovered its property, under the emperor Henry II, when Saint Gotthard became abbot. Kremsm√ºnster, in common with other religious houses, then fell into a decline, which was fortunately halted by the action of bishop Altmann of Passau, who brought a community from Gottesau, and introduced the reformed observance of Cluny into the abbey. After this it became known as one of the most flourishing houses in Germany, \\"excelling all other abbeys\\" says an anonymous chronicler, \\"in observance and piety, also in respect to its lands, buildings, books, paintings, and other possessions, and in the number of its members prominent in learning and in art\\". The monastic library was famous, and drew eminent scholars to Kremsm√ºnster, where several important historical works were written, including histories of the bishops of Passau and of the dukes of Bavaria, and the chronicles of the abbey itself. Schrodl gives a list of writers connected with Kremsm√ºnster from the eleventh to the 16th centuries, and of their literary labours. One of the most distinguished abbots was Ulrich Schoppenzaun (1454-1484), to whom, and to his disciple and successor Johann Schreiner (1505-1524), it is due that Kremsm√ºnster survived the Reformation. Abbey Church interior From the Reformation period onwards a succession of able abbots kept the abbey on track. Abbot Gregor Lechner (1543‚Äì1558), towards the middle of the 16th century, made the monastic school, previously private, into a public school, and did much to preserve Catholicism in the district, where the Protestant doctrines had become widely prevalent - to the extent that his successor, Abbot Weiner (1558-1565) favoured them and thus introduced dissension into the abbey, dissension which risked developing into serious disruption. This was prevented by succeeding abbots: Abbot Wolfradt especially (1613-1639) brought the monastery into so highly flourishing a condition that he was known as its third founder. Its reputation as a house of studies and learning was increased still further under his successor, Placid Buchauer (1644-1669). Among the abbots of the 18th century the most prominent and distinguished was Alexander Fixlmillner (1731-1759), who built the great observatory, constructed many roads on the monastic estate, and was a man of edifying life and great charity to the poor. His nephew Placidus Fixlmillner, the first astronomer to compute the orbit of Uranus, was later appointed the director of the observatory. Towards the end of the 18th century the policy of Emperor Joseph II with regard to the religious houses of his empire threatened to close Kremsm√ºnster, like many others, but it was fortunate enough to escape. The abbey suffered a great deal during the Napoleonic wars, and was slow in recovering its position. It was not until the abbacy of Thomas Mitterndorfer (1840-1860) that, having recovered its material security, and re-established learning and discipline, it regained its former prestige. One of the most illustrious abbots in the 19th century was Dom C√∂lestin Ganglbauer (died 1889), who celebrated in 1877 the 1100th anniversary of the foundation, became Archbishop of Vienna in 1881 and was raised to the cardinalate in 1884. In the 20th century Dom Leander Czerny, the distinguished entomologist, was abbot from 1905 to 1929. Since 1625 the abbey has been a member of the Austrian Congregation, now within the Benedictine Confederation. The abbey also played a role in the end of World War II, as it was here that on May 8, 1945, the exiled Slovak government capitulated to General Walton Walker leading the XX Corps of the 3rd US Army. Buildings Mathematical Tower with astronomical observatories From the middle of the 17th century, thanks to an extensive programme of construction largely reusing older building materials, the premises grew so large that in the whole of Austria they were second only to Melk. The architect and builder was Jakob Prandtauer, who was also responsible for the abbey church at Melk. Kremsm√ºnster reached its greatest extent in the south wing, which is about 290 metres long. The most important rooms were situated here: the refectory, the library and the Emperor's Hall. The wing terminates to the east in the Mathematical Tower, 51 metres high, where the observatory is located (the Kremsm√ºnster Sternwarte). There is an interesting collection of objects of natural history in the lower part of the observatory, which is eight stories high; and a curious feature is the series of fish-tanks decorated with statues and a colonnade. Abbey church The main church is dedicated to \\"Christ the Saviour and St. Agapitus\\" (Zum Heiligen Erl√∂ser und zum Heiligen Agapitos). Construction was completed in 1277, in the late Romanesque and early Gothic styles. After 1613 the church was remodelled in the Baroque style. Between 1680 and 1720, the interior of the church was redecorated with splendid Baroque ornamentation to designs by Carlo Antonio Carlone, Giovanni Battista Colomba and Giovanni Battista Barberini. Of especial note is the Baroque high altar, created by Johann Andreas Wolf in 1712, after twelve years of design and preparation. The angels by Johann Michael Z√ºrn the younger, who kneel and stand at the numerous side-altars, are also impressive examples of the Austrian Baroque. The church also contains the celebrated Grave of Gunther, a cenotaph which originally had been placed in front of the high altar, and in its current form dates from sometime prior to 1304. School The monastery school has existed since at least 1549. The poet and writer Adalbert Stifter was educated here. The monks still work today in education and maintain a school, as well as in pastoral care.

It is one of the great libraries of Austria and contains about 160,000 volumes, besides 1,700 manuscripts and nearly 2,000 incunabula. The most valuable book is the \\"Codex Millenarius\\", a Gospel Book written around 800 in Mondsee Abbey. Facsimiles of this codex may be found in the libraries of a number of universities throughout the world. Treasures The most famous item of the treasury of the monastery is the Tassilo Chalice, donated to the monastery by its founder, Tassilo III. The copper and silver-gilt goblet (25.5 cm high, weighing 3 kg and holding 1.75 litres) was created some time between 768/769 and 788, possibly in Mondsee or Salzburg. The two Tassilo Candlesticks were originally thought to have been worked from the sceptre of Tassilo, but today are recognized as works of the mid 10th century. The Tassilo Chalice, the candlesticks and the Codex Millenarius are still used in religious services to this day, though only on special occasions.

Kelly, won the Newbery Medal for excellence in American children's literature in 1929. Centered on the historical fire that burned much of Krak√≥w in 1462, The Trumpeter of Krakow tells the fictional story of a family of Joseph Charnetski,The Trumpeter of Krakow by Eric P. Kelly. Study Guide, Joseph Charnetski; Plot Summary; and Themes and Characters, from BookRags and Gale's For Students Series, 2006, Thomson Gale a Polish noble family from Kresy (modern day Ukraine), who fled to Krak√≥w, Poland, in 1461 after their home is burned to the ground by the Cossack-Tartars of Bogdan Grozny, commonly known as \\"Peter of the Button Face\\" because of the button-shaped pockmark on his cheek. Plot Summary=To Krak√≥w Church of Our Lady St. Mary in Krak√≥w. After seeing a spy lurking around his house in Ukraine, Andrew Charnetski hastily removes his family to a safe location. While away, Peter of the Button Face, acting under the orders of Ivan III of Russia, burns the Charnetskis' village to the ground in search of the \\"Great Tarnov Crystal\\", a mysterious Tarnov crystal that has caused many wars over the millennia and had, a few centuries previously, been entrusted by the city of Tarn√≥w to the Charnetski family for safeguarding until its discovery by others, at which time it was to be given to the current king of Poland. Realizing that someone must have been after the crystal, and finding himself homeless, Andrew takes his family to Krak√≥w, where his cousin Andrew Tenczynski lives, in order to give the crystal to King Kazim√≠r Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. However, upon his arrival he finds that Tenczynski has been murdered and that his estate is under the control of Elizabeth of Austria, the queen of Poland. Destitute, Charnetski camps his family in the middle of the city for the day. Charnetski's fifteen-year-old son Joseph explores the city, passing the Church of Our Lady St. Mary, from which a trumpeter plays an unfinished song called \\"the Heynal\\" [in Polish: Hejna≈Ç mariacki] four times every hour, once to each direction (north, east, south, and west). Joseph ends up saving an alchemist named Nicholas Kreutz and his niece, El≈ºbietka, from a wolfdog (even though the book said a dog). Kreutz offers Joseph and his family an apartment just below his on the unsavory Street of the Pigeons, a street near Krak√≥w University where scientists and magicians often live. Meanwhile, Andrew Charnetski and his wife (who is never named) have been found by Peter of the Button Face, who has pursued them from Ukraine. Surrounded by bandits and a jeering crowd, Andrew, his wife, and Joseph (who joins them) are only saved by the appearance of Jan Kanty, a respected scholar and priest. Kanty offers Andrew the position of night trumpeter in the Church of Our Lady St. Mary. Delighted at the prospect of a job and home on such short notice, Andrew accepts both offers. The following night Andrew takes Joseph with him to the tower of the Church of Our Lady St. Mary, leaving his wife behind with El≈ºbietka. In the tower Andrew explains to his son the story of the trumpeter of Krak√≥w ‚Äî a trumpeter who, in 1241, was pierced by a Tartar arrow before he could finish the Heyna≈Ç. Accordingly, the song has always been abruptly cut short. The Alchemist The Alchemist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone (1771) by Joseph Wright of Derby. Nicholas Kreutz, meanwhile, teaches a German student named Johann Tring chemistry in the loft above his apartment every evening. Tring, however, is obsessed with the idea of obtaining the philosopher's stone, and finally convinces Kreutz to go through sessions of hypnosis, which Tring believes will open Kreutz's \\"Greater Mind\\", revealing the secret of the creation of a chrysopoeia. All Tring can glean from Kreutz's trances, however, is that the chrysopoeia is at hand (which Tring takes to mean that they have nearly discovered how to make it). When unhypnotized, Kreutz reasons that there cannot be one stone that automatically changes brass into gold, but that there must be a process by which such a change could occur. He believes that all things are subject to change, and wishes to change the bad things in the world to good things through the use of alchemy. An example he gives is the landlady's deformed son, Stas, whom Kreutz believes could be saved through alchemical transmutation. In the meantime, Peter of the Button Face hears Stas, the landlady's son, discussing the Charnetskis and pays him a fortune to learn of their whereabouts. He leads a burglary on the Charnetski's apartment while Andrew is up in the church tower, and discovers the Tarnov Crystal hidden in Andrew's mattress. He and his men are surprised, however, by the appearance of Nicholas Kreutz, clad in clothes covered in phosphorus and burning resin, and take him for a demon. The bandits flee and are caught by the night watchmen, but Peter stays to reclaim the Crystal. When Kreutz asks the mercenary why he has come, Peter realizes the alchemist is not a demon and stops being afraid. He directs Kreutz's attention to the Crystal, then trips the alchemist and grabs the gem, heading for the door. Kreutz throws some explosive powder at Peter, who drops the Crystal in agony and escapes over the rooftops of Krak√≥w. Tempted by the realization that the Crystal is the chrysopoeia he and Tring have been ardently seeking, Kreutz steals the Tarnov Crystal before anyone figures what has happened. When he tries to use the Crystal, however, Kreutz realized that it only makes him think of his own desires. He realized, then, that it can only reflect back the gazer's own subconscious knowledge, and therefore will not reveal the secret of chrysopoeia unless he himself has all the pieces stored somewhere in his head. The Broken Note Andrew teaches Joseph the Heyna≈Ç, realizing that he may be attacked by seekers of the Crystal and that someone must be left to trumpet the song on the hour. While in the tower one evening, Andrew and Joseph are attacked and held captive by Peter and his band. Peter demands to be led to the location of the Crystal (which neither Andrew nor Joseph knows), but first orders Joseph to trumpet the Heyna≈Ç since it is two o'clock and its absence will be noticed. Thinking quickly, Joseph plays the Hejna≈Ç the entire way through, not stopping at the broken note. El≈ºbietka, lying awake in her apartment waiting to hear the Heyna≈Ç, realizes the finished tune is a sign and rushes to Jan Kanty's cell. Kanty calls the night watchmen to his aid and heads for the church tower, where they surprise the bandits and free Andrew. Peter, meanwhile, notices the troop of watchmen and flees the city. The Great Tarnov Crystal The Vistula River. Much later, Kreutz finally gives in to temptation and reveals the Great Tarnov Crystal to Johann Tring. Tring is giddy with excitement and instructs Kreutz to gaze into the crystal. The alchemist, however, is tired from his numerous trances. Despite his faint protests, Tring makes him go into a trance by making him stare into the depths of the gemstone. In it his thoughts arrange themselves into a strange order, and he reads in the stone what Tring believes to be the formula for the changing brass into gold, but what is in actuality the formula for a niter-based explosive. When Tring mixes the ingredients together, the loft explodes into flames and Tring flees for cover. Kreutz grabs the stone and, still crazed, heads off into the streets of Krak√≥w. After that, he is dragged to the tower by Jan Kanty and the Great Tarnov Crystal is given back to Pan Andrew. The fire starts to spread through the Street of the Pigeons, and during the tumult the king's royal guards catch Peter of the Button Face skulking around the scene and haul him off to the prison. Joseph, his mother, and El≈ºbietka escape from their home to the church tower, and Joseph replaces his father as the trumpeter while Andrew goes to work stopping the flames, which have spread throughout the city. The fire is extinguished by the morning and Jan Kanty finds Nicholas Kreutz wandering aimlessly about in the rubble with the Tarnov Crystal in his hands. Jan Kanty, Nicholas Kreutz, and Andrew and Joseph Charnetski all seek an audience with King Kazim√≠r. Once granted, they present to him the Tarnov Crystal and tell them its story and theirs. The king then summons Peter of the Button Face, who bargains for his life by promising to tell the king why there have been disturbances in Ukraine. He tells the king that Ivan III, the king of Russia, wished to have Makhmud Khan invade Ukraine and capture it for Russia. Makhmud agreed under the condition that Ivan would procure for him the Great Tarnov Crystal. It was thus that Ivan hired the mercenary Bogdan Grozny, called Peter, to steal the Crystal. After hearing Peter's story, Kazim√≠r banishes the mercenary from Poland for life. As they begin to depart, the king gazes into the Crystal and becomes transfixed. Kreutz, still entranced, grabs the Crystal and runs out the door down to the banks of the Vistula, into which he throws the Tarnov Crystal. Jan Kanty and the king decide not to retrieve the crystal, deeming it safely protected in the grounds of the castle. Andrew Charnetski's house in Ukraine is rebuilt and he is rewarded by the king. Kreutz and El≈ºbietka come to Ukraine as well, the alchemist having regained his sanity, and six years later Joseph marries El≈ºbietka.

The NBC comedy is filmed in Los Angeles and due to their schedule/budget did not film scenes in Winnipeg. Though the series had shot scenes in New York City, they never left California for this episode. The episode did not call for any Winnipeg-specific locales. Los Angeles International Airport filled in for Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport. A downtown hotel and bar in the Financial District were the other two settings. Characters Michael Scott, Oscar Martinez and Andy Bernard visited Winnipeg in November. Michael was the only Dunder-Mifflin Regional Manager willing to visit Winnipeg in November. Andy was brought along mainly for being able to speak French, while Oscar is an accountant. They were there on a sales call to sell paper. While in Winnipeg, Oscar and Andy get drunk at a bar and become friends after limited interactions back at the office. Michael, with some help from Andy, hooks up with the hotel concierge at a bar. They go back to her room at the hotel. After having sex, Michael is kicked out of the room. The next day the three go to the sales meeting and secure the client for two years. However, Michael did not enjoy this stay in Winnipeg as it was not the \\"international\\" location he envisioned it to be and was still upset about his girlfriend being transferred in an earlier episode. Destination Winnipeg sent the show Winnipeg items such as Old Dutch chips and Fort Garry Brewing Company beer bottles. The budget also limited the amount of fake snow used in the episode. Writer Brent Forrester explained in a CBC News interview that, \\"It seemed like Montreal was maybe too exotic and Vancouver also a little maybe too conventionally sexy, and Winnipeg seemed to strike the right balance between exotic and obscure.\\" Surprisingly, there was only one brief joke at the expense of Winnipeg, about traveling there in November. Canadian writer Anthony Farrell ensured the script was not filled with Canadian stereotypes. *The Simpsons For the show‚Äôs sixteenth season, parts of the sixth episode, \\"Midnight Rx,\\" took place in Winnipeg. The episode dealt with Homer Simpson and his dad traveling to Winnipeg to obtain cheap prescription drugs and smuggle them into the States. They become heroes back in Springfield, USA when they brought the cheap prescription drugs. Ned Flanders and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon later join the Simpson men on another trip to Winnipeg. Ned encounters a Winnipegger who talks and looks just like he does. Ned was upset to find out his Canadian counterpart was smoking medical marijuana, called a \\"reeferino.\\" The four then drive to the Manitoba/North Dakota border crossing where their drug smuggling is discovered. Instead of \\"Welcome to Winnipeg: One Great City!\\" the Simpsons drove by \\"We Were Born Here, What's Your Excuse\\" on the welcome sign. Hollywood films famously not filmed in Winnipeg *Legends of the Fall (1994) - The film's producers wanted to use Winnipeg's Exchange District, renowned for its wealth of turn of the century-era warehouses and office buildings, for scenes taking place in Helena, Montana. This plan was scuttled when several residents, and later city government, objected to the film crew's desire to remove several dozen trees growing along the sidewalks. Although TriStar offered to replant and/or replace the trees after wrapping, they were rebuffed.

Howell is a Board Member In Memoriam at the IWMF (International Women's Media Foundation).IWMF website Biography Howell was born in San Antonio, Texas, where her father worked as a journalist at the San Antonio Express-News and was a well-known broadcaster and meteorologist at WOAI Radio and TV. Howell entered journalism by working on her high school paper and then, as a journalism student, on The Daily Texan, the student newspaper for The University of Texas at Austin. After graduation, Howell had difficulty finding a job other than on old-time women's pages and instead took a job at a local TV and radio station. Later, she was hired to work on the copy desk of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, before moving to the Minneapolis Star as a reporter, then city editor and assistant managing editor. She was hired at the St. Paul Pioneer Press as senior vice president and editor before becoming the Washington bureau chief and editor of Newhouse News Service from 1990 until 2005. Howell served on the board of directors of the American Society of Newspaper Editors from 1992 to 1999 and on the ASNE Foundation Board from 2000 until her death. She was a member of the board of the International Women's Media Foundation and the National Press Foundation. On January 2, 2010, Howell died after being struck by a car while she was vacationing in New Zealand. She had stopped to take a photo near Blenheim, and may have looked the wrong way for other vehicles. Washington Post career On February 25, 2005, Howell was named ombudsman of the Washington Post. On October 23, 2005, Howell introduced herself to readers by saying she had two goals in mind: \\"to foster good journalism and to increase understanding between the Post and its readers.\\" Her farewell column appeared on December 28, 2008. Andrew Alexander took over as the Post ombudsman on February 2, 2009. Abramoff column controversy In January 2006, Howell became involved in a dispute with some of her readers over the contents of one of her columns. In her January 15 column defending the reporting by Washington Post reporter Susan Schmidt on lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Howell claimed that Abramoff \\"had made substantial campaign contributions to both major parties,\\" referring to the Republicans and Democrats. Many readers took exception to Howell's statement, pointing to Federal Election Commission records that showed Abramoff had given money only to Republicans and none to Democrats.http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/outlook/3588924.html After receiving many angry comments at the Post's blog, Howell responded: \\"A better way to have said it would be that Abramoff 'directed' contributions to both parties.\\" This did not satisfy some readers of the blog, who responded that although Abramoff's clients did give money to both parties, there was no evidence that Abramoff \\"directed\\" contributions to Democrats and furthermore, that Abramoff's clients had given less money to Democrats than non-Abramoff clients. As the demands on the blog for a retraction and correction continued, the management of the Post decided to shut down and pull all comments from the blog. Jim Brady, executive editor of washingtonpost.com, explained this by saying that there had been \\"personal attacks, the use of profanity and hate speech\\" by \\"a significant number of folks\\". Some readers were skeptical of his claims and brought forth a mirror site of the blog that showed that there were relatively few posts fitting Brady's description. Brady responded by saying that the comments never showed up on the blog because management had been removing them as soon as they were posted. The Post has since restored 948 comments. On January 22, 2006, Howell discussed the controversy started by her column the previous week. She repeated the statement that Abramoff had directed his clients to donate to both parties, but this time referred to her original assertion as a mistake and agreed that the Abramoff scandal is \\"not a bipartisan scandal; it's a Republican scandal.\\" Howell went on to describe some of the \\"abusive\\" comments and e-mails she received, saying \\"I'll read every e-mail and answer as many legitimate complaints as I can ... But I will reject abuse and all that it stands for,\\" adding, \\"... I have a tough hide, and a few curse words (which I use frequently) are not going to hurt my feelings.\\" The kicker for the column summed up her attitude about the whole matter: \\"To all of those who wanted me fired, I'm afraid you're out of luck. I have a contract. For the next two years, I will continue to speak my mind. Keep smiling. I will.\\" References External links  * ASNE profile * Washington Post Archives * Category:1941 births Category:2010 deaths Category:American women journalists Category:Journalists from Washington, D.C.

Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen was a financial endowment established in 1882 by John Fox Slater for education of African Americans in the Southern United States. It ceased independent operation in 1937, by which time it had disbursed about $4,000,000. Establishment John Fox Slater, founder of the fund In May 1882 Slater transferred $1,000,000 to a board of trustees incorporated by the State of New York. The fund's stated purpose was \\"uplifting the lately emancipated population of the Southern States and their posterity by conferring on them the blessings of Christian education.\\"Memorial 1885, p.29 The Peabody Education Fund established in 1867 was restricted to support existing schools in the South (by definition for whites only, as no public schools for freedmen existed before the Civil War and public schools were limited after Reconstruction.) Instead, the Slater Fund contributed to schools which provided the education of colored students. The majority of blacks still lived in rural areas and had to attend segregated public schools, which were typically underfunded by the white Democrat- dominated state legislatures. With an economy chiefly based on agriculture, the South was struggling to recover from losses during the American Civil War, and funds for public services were limited. Personnel Among the original trustees were Rutherford B Hayes, Morrison R Waite, William E Dodge, Phillips Brooks, Daniel Coit Gilman, Morris Ketchum Jesup and the donor's son, William A. Slater; and among members chosen later were Melville W Fuller, William E Dodge, Jr, Henry Codman Potter, Cleveland H Dodge and Seth Low. In 1909 by careful investment the fund had increased, in spite of expenditures, to more than $1,500,000. Atticus Greene Haygood, Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry, Wallace Buttrick, and James H. Dillard were general agents of the fund. Work The fund was of great value in aiding vocational schools in the South, its largest beneficiaries being the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute of Hampton, Virginia, the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute of Tuskegee, Alabama, Spelman Seminary in Atlanta, Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina, and Fisk University, in Nashville, Tennessee. At Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is the Slater State Normal and Industrial School, founded in 1892 and named after the founder of the fund; it is now part of Winston-Salem State University. Other state normal schools for African Americans received assistance from the fund, as did some Southern urban school boards. The fund was opposed to liberal education for blacks, believing it would foster discontent. Through its funding of the Hampton Institute the fund also provided for the annual Hampton Negro Conference held there. About 1915, the Peabody Education Fund was dissolved, with some of its assets transferred to the Slater Fund.In 1937, the Southern Education Foundation was formed by merging the assets and resources of the Slater Fund, the Negro Rural School Fund, and the Virginia Randolph Fund.

In both Spain and Latin America many variations exist, sometimes frying the main ingredient before it's marinated. Escabeche of seafood, fish, chicken, rabbit or pork are common in Spain and Portugal. Terminology According to the DRAE, the Spanish and Portuguese word escabeche originates in the Andalusi Arabic spoken in Muslim Spain and ultimately Persian. Derives from al-sikbaj (ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÉÿ®ÿßÿ¨), the name of a popular meat dish cooked in a sweet-and-sour sauce, usually vinegar and honey or date molasses.Medieval Arab Cookery, Maxime Rodinson, A. J. Arberry, and Charles Perry. . This technique spread throughout the former Spanish Empire and is particularly common in Latin America and the Phillipines. The dish is known as escoveitch or escoveech fish in Jamaica and is marinated in a sauce of vinegar, onions, carrots and scotch bonnet peppers overnight. It is known as escabecio, scapece or savoro in Italy, savoro in Greece (especially Ionian islands) and scabetche in North Africa. Variations The dish is common in Spain and has evolved with local modifications in the Spanish-speaking world. It is well represented in Portugal, usually spiced with pepper corns, chilies, peppers, onions, garlic and sliced carrots. The dish is popular in the Philippines and Guam, both former Spanish colonies, where it is the closest to the original Spanish version: adapting the type of fish to ones locally available but respecting the original technique. In international versions, escabeche is usually poached or fried, then served cold after marinating in a refrigerator overnight or longer. The acid in the marinade is usually vinegar but can include citrus juice. (a common conservation technique, a pH of 4 or lower effectively stops putrefaction of the product).

Owned by Cumulus Media, WWWW-FM has a transmitter at its studios off of South Wagner Road to the northwest of downtown Ann Arbor. History=Early years The 102.9 frequency began operations in or on March 1, 1962 as WOIA and is co-owned with WOIB in Saline, Michigan. Originally, WOIA and WOIB simulcast a middle of the road music format with some Top 40 music played on weekends. The format changed to full- time Top 40 in 1967. WOIA personalities during this time included John Records Landecker, later to become a legend in Chicago radio, and Art Vuolo Jr., later to become known as \\"Radio's Best Friend.\\" In 1970, the stations became WNRS AM/WNRZ FM \\"Ann Arbor's Winners.\\" The \\"Winners\\" airstaff included a young Arthur Penhallow, who later became a fixture at WRIF in Detroit for nearly 40 years; at WNRS/WNRZ, his air name was \\"Cicero Grimes.\\" \\"Winners\\" took advantage of Ann Arbor's status as a breakout market for songs that later went on to success in the Detroit market, proclaiming: \\"Winners Plays... Detroit Watches.\\" The WNRS/WNRZ format remained Top 40 at first, but the two stations soon separated programming, with WNRS adopting a country format and WNRZ becoming a full-time 24-hour free-form progressive rock station. Former WABX personalities Jerry Goodwin and Ann Christ worked at WNRZ in 1972, and John Sinclair also hosted a Sunday-evening show. The station built up a loyal following in Ann Arbor's \\"hippie\\" community, but was financially unsuccessful, leading then-owner Thomas Boodell to change the station to a simulcast of WNRS's country programming and change the locks at the station to keep the former progressive-rock hosts out of the studio. After a petition to restore the progressive programming generated 10,000 signatures, Boodell threw progressive-rock listeners a bone by reinstating progressive rock on the station nightly from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. This split format continued until November 1974, when the station became again temporarily a full-time simulcast of WNRS as preparations were made for the stations' sale to Rochester, New York-based Community Music Services and the FM station's facilities were upgraded. WNRZ-FM was a pioneer in the many radio aspects of the industry, most notably improvements to the quadraphonic FM stereo system invented in 1969 by Louis Dorren and improved upon by station chief engineer Brian Brown. The station participated in the National Quadraphonic Radio Committee field trials for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). WNRZ-FM was actually the first FM station to transmit program audio in quadraphonic sound. Brown also designed and built one of the first combination audio equalizer/compressors, which was used to enhance the poor audio quality of the Collins (now Rockwell Collins) AM radio transmitter at WNRZ. A second device was installed to process the quadraphonic FM program audio. These units literally caused the audio to \\"leap out\\" of the radio,Ann Arbor News, Ann Arbor, Michigan, January 3, 1973 according to industry pundits. Community Music Services took over control of WNRZ in December 1974 and four months later, after a brief stunting period proclaiming \\"Something BIG is coming to 103 FM,\\" changed the station's format back to progressive rock music (this time, however, without free-form elements and with an approved station playlist) under the new call letters WIQB, with a call sign which designated the number \\"103\\" (the letters I-Q-B were chosen because of their resemblance to the numbers 1-0-3). The first record played on the new W-103 was \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" by the Rolling Stones. WIQB heavily promoted its quadraphonic sound, identifying on-air as QuadRock 103 during the 1970s. (Meanwhile, 1290 AM has since been through a multitude of format changes and is now WLBY, a business-talk station). In 1979, the progressive rock radio's personality lineup consisted of John Christian, Randy Z, Jim Dulzo, Chuck Horn and others. As the 1980s dawned, WIQB, under new owner Ernie Winn, modified its format from progressive rock to a Top 40/album rock mixture. During the '80s, Rock 103 was usually the highest-rated local station in the Ann Arbor market (jingles of the period touted the fact they were \\"Ann Arbor's Number One!\\"). In 1987, the station boosted power to 50,000 watts, dramatically increasing its coverage area to the west (toward Jackson) and north (toward Fenton), although the station's eastward signal remained impeded by 102.7 FM in Mount Clemens (then WKSG). The station went through numerous ownership changes from 1974 onward. During the mid-1990s, WIQB became an adult album alternative station under the ownership of Arbor Radio, LP. In late 1997, Cumulus Broadcasting took control of the station and switched WIQB's format to active rock. As an active rock station, Rock 103, then owned by Cumulus Broadcasting, subsequently crashed in the ratings and was regularly defeated in its own market by Detroit's WRIF. The station was an afterthought of then- GM Ray Nelson, who along with the sales managers proceeded to change the format to country. History of \\"W4\\" The WWWW calls were originally used for 106.7 FM (and later 1130 AM) in Detroit, Michigan. Many Detroit-area radio listeners of the 1970s remember WWWW-FM as a rock station with a slightly progressive bent, and one which would offer unique programming, such as the \\"All-Night Album Replay,\\" wherein several full rock LPs would be played consecutively during a given evening. Print advertising for the station occasionally featured images of Godzilla, the mythical character seen in the Toho-produced Japanese series of feature films. That format would not extend into the 1980s, however. The change to the country format (nicknamed \\"W4 Country\\") alienated many former listeners, as reflected in initial ratings changes, and soon acquired an entirely new audience, though a rare few individuals (such as on-air personality Chuck Santoni, who is now at WSAQ-FM in Port Huron) remained with the station. In reality, the station maintained its country format much longer than the previous rock format. In October 2000 \\"Alice 106.7\\" finally changed their call letters to \\"WLLC-FM\\" (not to be confused with yet another previous Detroit FM rock station, WLLZ-FM (98.7, now known as WDZH and not to be confused with the current WLLZ on 106.7), as later emphasized when the call letters were spoken) and the \\"WWWW\\" call letters were moved to 102.9 FM in Ann Arbor to relaunch \\"W4 Country\\" on September 29, 2000. The new \\"W4 Country\\" soon became a ratings success in Ann Arbor. Arbitron often rates WWWW-FM as the top-rated music station in the market 12+; it is usually second place overall, behind only Detroit's WJR. Among local stations in Ann Arbor/Washtenaw County, W4 is the highest-rated commercial station, although it has been reported that if non-commercial stations were counted, NPR station WUOM would come out on top. W4's signal into metropolitan Detroit is impeded by WDKL in Mount Clemens in Macomb County, but it still frequently shows up toward the bottom of the Detroit ratings. W4's signal is much stronger toward the south, west and north of Ann Arbor, and the station gets a listenable signal as far away as Flint, Lansing, and Toledo On the top of every hour, the station still uses its W4 jingles from 106.7 in the late 90s. Changes in 2006 On July 24, 2006, the call letters for 102.9 FM in Ann Arbor were temporarily changed to WFOR-FM (there is a CBS-owned TV station in Miami, Florida with the WFOR call letters), as Clear Channel moved the \\"WWWW\\" call letters to the 1310 AM facility in Detroit. One week later, on July 31, 102.9 switched to WWWW-FM, different in only the \\"-FM\\" suffix. On September 15, 2006, the WDTW call letters returned to 1310 AM, and WDTW-FM would change its callsign to WLLZ in 2019.

He joined the Benedictines at Norwich moving on to the Benedictine Gloucester College, Oxford where he became one of the most outstanding students of his generation, being especially proficient in Hebrew. He is known to have accompanied Simon Langham to Rome, then Montefiascone and Avignon and he held the post of socius in Langham's household. Being a man of learning and ability, he obtained a post in the Curia. He was instrumental in the attack and subsequent condemnation of John Wycliff and supporting Catholic orthodoxy in England. He was made a Cardinal by Urban VI, on 21 September 1381. On 7 March 1381 or 1382, he was nominated Dean of York. He arranged Richard II and Anne of Bohemia's wedding coronation in Westminster Abbey and probably composed the Liber Regalis. A document in the Abbey concerning the coronation offerings gives him as Cardinal of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. In 1385 he was imprisoned at Nocera in Campania by Urban on a charge of conspiring with five other cardinals against the pope and was deprived of his cardinalate and deanery. With his fellow captives he was dragged across Italy arriving at Genoa in autumn 1385. Here the others were put to death but Adam was spared through the personal intervention of Richard II. The next pope, Boniface IX, restored his cardinalate on 18 December 1389. It has been suggested that for a time Easton returned to England. The Norwich Record Office documents the sending of the Cardinal's books by way of the Low Countries to Norwich for his use there. He retained benefices in England throughout this period, including Somersham, the deanery of York and a prebend in Salisbury Cathedral, which he subsequently exchanged for the living of Heygham (Heigham) in Norfolk. He wrote many works the most significant of which was a massive volume entitled the Defence of Ecclesiastical Power, of which only the prologue and first book survive. In it he defended the church's authority against the state, apparently attacking the views of Marsilius of Padua, John of Jandun and William of Occam and by implication, also refuting Wyclif's theology as false and erroneous.Pantin (1948) p.178-180 He was always courteous to his opponents, referring to them as 'men of great learning and abundance of sanctity'. A number of his other works still exist, as do some of the manuscripts of his library, which were shipped back to Norwich from Rome in six barrels, and he composed the Office for the Visitation of Our Lady. He also laboured for the canonisation of Birgitta of Sweden in 1391 with a structured refutation of a Perugian 'Devil's Advocate', in a document in which he defended women's visionary writings. He may have been Julian of Norwich's spiritual director, editing her Long Text Showing of Love in the same way that Birgitta of Sweden's spiritual director, Alfonso of Jaen, edited her Revelationes. Alfonso became director to Catherine of Siena, whose confessor and executor was William Flete, the Cambridge-educated Augustinian Hermit of Lecceto, and to Chiara Gambacorta. Easton's Defense of St Birgitta echoes Alfonso of Jaen's Epistola Solitarii, and William Flete's Remedies against Temptations, all of which appear in Julian's text. He died at Rome, 15 September (according to others, 20 October) 1397. His tomb, constructed later, is in his Cardinalate Basilica of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere.

His father, the Italian composer Pietro Antonio Fiocco, and one of his older step-brother Jean-Joseph Fiocco gave him much of his musical education. He also learned Greek and Latin well enough to be able to become a schoolteacher in both those subjects. Joseph Hector Fiocco worked under his step-brother‚Äôs direction at the Ducal Chapel of the Notre-Dame du Sablon most sources cite sometime before 1730. In 1730, Joseph Hector became sous-maitre (submaster) of the Notre-Dame du Sablon, He did not keep this position for long he resigned in 1731 to become sangmeester (choirmaster) at Antwerp Cathedral. At the cathedral of Antwerp (1731‚Äì37) he was in charge of the music. In 1737 he returned to his birthplace and worked in the collegiate church of St. Michel and Ste Gudule. He died in Brussels. (38 years old). In connection with his cathedral employment, Fiocco wrote many choral works, including motets and Mass settings. Some of his most significant compositions are Lamentations du Jeudi Saint, a Missa solemnis and Pi√®ces de Clavecin. His two suites for harpsichord were dedicated to the Duke of Arenberg, and they incorporate French and Italian styles. The first suite begins in the style of Couperin and ends with four Italian-style movements: Adagio, Allegro, Andante, and Vivace. He is also known to Suzuki violin students for his Allegro, which is part of the Book Six Suzuki violin repertoire (and has been recorded by Itzhak Perlman, among others). This piece has also been arranged for string quartet, and is sometimes heard at weddings. Sources * *Stellfeld, Christiane. Les Fiocco, une famille de musiciens belges aux XVIIe et XVIIIe si√®cles.

The three were members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, also known as the Fenians, an organisation dedicated to ending British rule in Ireland, and were among a group of 30‚Äì40 Fenians who attacked a horse-drawn police van transporting two arrested leaders of the Brotherhood, Thomas J. Kelly and Timothy Deasy, to Belle Vue Gaol. Police Sergeant Charles Brett, travelling inside with the keys, was shot and killed as the attackers attempted to force the van open by blowing the lock. Kelly and Deasy were released after another prisoner in the van took the keys from Brett's body and passed them to the group outside through a ventilation grill; the pair were never recaptured, despite an extensive search. Two others were also charged and found guilty of Brett's murder, Thomas Maguire and Edward O'Meagher Condon, but their death sentences were overturned‚ÄîO'Meagher Condon's through the intercession of the United States government (he was an American citizen), and Maguire's because the evidence given against him was considered unsatisfactory. Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien were publicly hanged on a temporary structure built on the wall of Salford Gaol, on 23 November 1867, in front of a crowd of 8,000‚Äì10,000. Brett was the first Manchester City Police officer to be killed on duty, and he is memorialised in a monument in St Ann's Church. Background The whole of Ireland had been under British rule since the end of the Nine Years' War in 1603. The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) was founded on 17 March 1858 by James Stephens, with the aim of establishing an independent democratic republic in Ireland. The IRB was a revolutionary fraternal organisation, rather than an insurrectionary conspiracy; Stephens believed that a \\"thorough social revolution\\" was required in Ireland before the people could become republicans. The Fenian Brotherhood was founded in New York in 1858 by John O'Mahony, ostensibly the IRB's American wing. By 1865 the IRB had an estimated 100,000 members, and was carrying out frequent acts of violence in metropolitan Britain. The Irish community in Manchester accounted for more than 10 per cent of the population, and one contemporary estimate put the number of Fenians and Fenian sympathisers living within of the city at 50,000. In 1867 the Fenians were preparing to launch an armed uprising against British rule, but their plans became known to the authorities, and several key members of the movement's leadership were arrested and convicted. Two succeeded in evading the police, Thomas J. Kelly and Timothy Deasy, and travelled from Ireland to Britain to reorganise and raise the morale of the Fenian groups there in the wake of the failed uprising. Both were Irish Americans who had fought with distinction in the American Civil War ‚Äì Kelly achieving the rank of colonel and Deasy that of captain ‚Äì and both had played important roles in the abortive uprising; Kelly had been declared the chief executive of the Irish Republic at a secret republican convention, and Deasy commanded a Fenian brigade in County Cork. During the early hours of 11 September 1867, police arrested two men found loitering in Oak Street, Shudehill, suspecting them of planning to rob a shop. Both were charged under the Vagrancy Act and held in custody. The Manchester police were initially unaware of their identities, until their colleagues in the Irish police identified them as Kelly and Deasy. Rescue The scene of the attack, on Hyde Road, Manchester. This modern bridge has replaced the original \\"Fenian Arch\\". On 18 September 1867, Kelly and Deasy were being transferred from the courthouse to Belle Vue Gaol on Hyde Road, Gorton. They were handcuffed and locked in two separate compartments inside a police van escorted by a squad of 12 mounted policemen. The van contained six prisoners: a 12-year-old boy who was being taken to a reformatory, three women convicted of misdemeanours, and the two Fenians. As it passed under a railway arch, a man darted into the middle of the road, pointed a pistol at the driver and told him to stop. Simultaneously, a party of about 30‚Äì40 men leaped over a wall at the side of the road, surrounded the van and seized the horses, one of which they shot. The unarmed police were described by O'Meagher Condon, who organised the attack on the police van, as \\"a miscellaneous lot, apparently embracing the long and short and the fat and lean of the Manchester force\\"; they offered little resistance and soon fled. A commemoration plaque at the site of the incident The rescuers, after an unsuccessful attempt to force open the van with hatchets, sledgehammers, and crowbars, called upon Police Sergeant Brett, who was inside the van with the prisoners, to open the door. Brett refused, so one of the rescuers placed his revolver at the keyhole of the van to blow the lock, just as Brett looked through the keyhole to see what was happening outside. The bullet passed through his eye into his brain and killed him. The door was opened when one of the women prisoners took the keys from Brett's pocket, and passed them through a ventilator to the Fenians outside, allowing Kelly and Deasy to escape. Brett was the first Manchester police officer to be killed on duty, in an incident that became known locally as the \\"Manchester Outrages\\". Investigation The police suspected that Kelly and Deasy had been taken by their rescuers to Ancoats, considered at that time to be a Fenian area of Manchester. Anonymous letters alleged that the pair were being sheltered in a house on Every Street, but the 50 armed police who raided the premises found no signs of the fugitives. Despite a reward of ¬£300 offered by the authorities, equivalent to about seven times a worker's average annual earnings, neither Kelly nor Deasy were recaptured. An article published in the 14 November edition of The Times newspaper reported that they had made their way to Liverpool, from where they had taken passage on a ship bound for New York. The police raided Manchester's Irish quarters and brought \\"dozens of suspects, selected almost at random\\", before local magistrates; the raids have been described as a \\"reign of terror\\" for the Irish in Manchester. Amongst those arrested was Thomas Maguire, a young Royal Marine on leave who had been in the vicinity of the attack on the police van and was Irish. Such was the zeal of the police that one man with a strong Irish accent surrendered himself to the magistrates \\"as the only means I have of saving myself from being arrested over and over again wherever I go, as a Fenian\\". Committal proceedings On 27 September 1867 committal proceedings were heard in front of a magistrate to establish whether there was a prima facie case against the 28 accused. The team of defence barristers included Chartist leader Ernest Jones, who had spent two years in prison for making seditious speeches, and W. P. Roberts, whose fee was paid by subscribers to a defence fund to represent nine of the men. Jones, representing Condon and O'Brien, clashed with the court almost immediately because the accused were handcuffed, saying \\"It appears to be discreditable to the administration of justice that men whom the law presumes to be innocent should be brought into Court handcuffed together like a couple of hounds.\\" Jones also objected to the presence of a number of soldiers in the courtroom, and when the magistrate refused to order the prisoners' handcuffs to be removed he \\"marched dramatically\\" out of the courtroom saying \\"Then as a member of the Bar I decline to sit in any Court where the police override the Magistrate ... I cannot disgrace the Bar by proceeding with the defence.\\" All but two of the accused, Allen and Larkin, claimed that they had witnesses who would testify that they were elsewhere when the police van was attacked. The defence argued that \\"the rescue was not illegal as the prisoners [Kelly and Deasy] were wrongly imprisoned\\", and that there was no intention of \\"sacrificing human life\\", as evidenced by only a single fatality despite the presence of so many guns and so many shots being fired. Nevertheless, 26 of the prisoners were sent for trial before a judge and jury at the next assizes; two were released because of \\"unsatisfactory identification\\". Trial Proceedings began on 28 October 1867, in front of Mr Justice Blackburne and Mr Justice Mellor. Twenty-six appeared in court on the first day in front of a grand jury, which found that there was a prima facie case against all of the defendants for murder, felony, and misdemeanour. It was decided to charge the five \\"principal offenders\\" ‚Äì Allen, Larkin, Gould (O'Brien), Shore (Condon), and Maguire ‚Äì under one indictment. They were therefore brought back to the courtroom the following day, when their trial proper began, despite none of them having fired the fatal shot. Allen was a 19-year-old carpenter; Larkin was a tailor, the only married member of the group, and had five children. O'Brien, who had fought in the American Civil War, was a 30-year-old shop assistant from County Cork. O'Meagher Condon, born in Cork and 32 years old, had also fought for the Union side in the American Civil War. Thomas Maguire was a Royal Marine who had served for 10 years and had just returned home on leave. The jury retired at 6:15 pm on the fifth day and returned at 7:30 pm to give its verdict of guilty for each of the five defendants. When asked if they had anything to say before sentence was passed, several of the convicted men made a closing speech. Allen stated his innocence, and that he regretted the death of Sergeant Brett, but that he was prepared to \\"die proudly and triumphantly in defence of republican principles and the liberty of an oppressed and enslaved people\\". Larkin said he felt that he had received a fair trial, and that his counsel had done everything they could in his defence. He ended by saying: \\"So I look to the mercy of God. May God forgive all who have sworn my life away. As I am a dying man, I forgive them from the bottom of my heart. May God forgive them.\\" O'Brien claimed that all of the evidence given against him was false, and that as an American citizen he ought not to be facing trial in a UK court. He then went on at length to condemn the British government, the \\"imbecile and tyrannical rulers\\" of Ireland, until he was interrupted by the judge, who appealed to him to cease his remarks: \\"The only effect of your observations must be to tell against you with those who have to consider the sentence. I advise you to say nothing more of that sort. I do so entirely for your own sake.\\" O'Meagher Condon's address to the court was considered by The Times to have \\"excelled all the other convicts in his zeal for the Fenian cause\\". He admitted to having organised the attack on the police van in his role as leader of the north-west section of the movement, but claimed that he \\"never threw a stone or fired a pistol; I was never at the place [where the attack took place] ... it is all totally false\\". He went on to say that \\"had I committed anything against the Crown of England, I would have scorned myself had I attempted to deny it\\". Towards the end of his speech he shouted, \\"God save Ireland!\\", a cry taken up by his companions in the dock. William Allen, Michael Larkin, Michael O'Brien, Thomas Maguire, and Edward O'Meagher Condon, were sentenced to death by hanging ‚Äì the only punishment English law at that time allowed for murder ‚Äì again crying \\"God save Ireland\\" from the dock after sentence was pronounced. Maguire was subsequently pardoned and discharged, and O'Meagher Condon's sentence was commuted on the eve of his execution. The trial took place in what was described as a \\"climate of anti-Irish hysteria\\" by the weekly Reynold's Newspaper, which described it as a \\"deep and everlasting disgrace to the English government\\", the product of an ignoble panic which seized the governing classes. A yell of vengeance, it said, had issued from every aristocratic organ, and that before any evidence had been obtained the prisoners' guilt was assumed and their executions had been demanded. Reprieves In Thomas Maguire's case the witnesses who had identified the prisoners and had testified that Maguire was in the forefront of the attack had their evidence shown to be transparently false. This resulted in over 30 English reporters sending an appeal to the Home Secretary to have him pardoned. With such widespread doubts about the conviction of Maguire the government yielded to the pressure to grant him a pardon. This led many to believe that the other four would not be hanged since they had been convicted on the evidence of the same witnesses who, according to Liz Curtis, had \\"blatantly perjured themselves in the case of Maguire\\". While eminent lawyers tried through procedural means to halt the executions, leading figures such as John Bright, Charles Bradlaugh and John Stuart Mill appealed for clemency. Execution New Bailey Prison at Salford, 1832 A crowd estimated at 8,000‚Äì10,000 gathered outside the walls of Salford Gaol on the evening of 22 November 1867 to witness the public execution of the three convicted men the following morning. A platform had been built about above ground, through the outside wall of the jail facing New Bailey Street, to support the gallows. The spectators were \\"well supplied by the gin palaces of Deansgate and the portable beer and coffee stalls\\". According to Father Gadd, one of the three Catholic priests who attended to the men: The authorities took considerable pains to discourage any rescue attempt. Over 2,500 regular and special police were deployed in and around the prison, augmented by a military presence which included a detachment of the 72nd Highlanders and a squadron of the Eighth Hussars. All traffic in and out of the city was stopped. The Times newspaper reported that by the time the hangings took place, shortly after 8:00 am, \\"the mob were quiet and orderly\\", in contrast to the previous night and early morning. The executioner, William Calcraft, was the most famous of the 19th century, but was reportedly nervous of executing Fenians, because of threats he had received. He was also \\"particularly incompetent\\", and was \\"notoriously unable to calculate the correct length of rope required for each individual hanging; he frequently had to rush below the scaffold to pull on his victim's legs to hasten death\\". Most accounts claim that Allen died almost instantaneously from a broken neck, but Larkin and O'Brien were not so fortunate. Father Gadd reported that: Father Gadd refused to allow Calcraft to dispatch O'Brien in the same way, and so \\"for three-quarters of an hour the good priest knelt, holding the dying man's hands within his own, reciting the prayers for the dying. Then the long drawn out agony ended.\\" The bodies of the three men were buried in the New Bailey Prison graveyard, from which they were transferred to Strangeways Prison Cemetery when New Bailey Prison closed in 1868. In 1991 their remains were cremated and reinterred at Blackley Cemetery in Manchester. Aftermath Mural in Belfast, 2007 Most of the British press had demanded \\"retribution swift and stern\\", not because the men were Irish, but because they were Fenians; \\"the public demand for the death penalty was not simply an expression of anti-Irish sentiment, but rather a product of the Fenian panic and popular feelings of insecurity and the desire for order.\\" The Daily Telegraph, for instance, although like most of its contemporaries describing Brett's death as \\"a vulgar, dastardly murder\\", nevertheless supported reform in Ireland; \\"we may hang convicted Fenians with good conscience, but we should also thoroughly redress those evils distinctly due to English policy and still supported by English power.\\" Manchester Martyrs monument, Glasnevin, Dublin Many funeral processions were held in Ireland and even in a few British cities during the weeks following the executions, sometimes attracting crowds of thousands. These demonstrations of support for the three Fenians further outraged British public opinion, and \\"reinforced the prevailing sentiment that the Irish moral compass was somehow off-center\\". The executions gave rise to an enormous groundswell of feeling among Irish communities the world over. In New Zealand, for instance, seven men were convicted of unlawful assembly in a high-profile trial following a mock funeral to Hokitika cemetery; two of the seven, a newspaper editor and a priest, pleaded guilty to seditious libel, having published \\"a succession of very rabid articles about the Queen's Government.\\" The viceregal government declared the holding of a Manchester Martyr funeral procession illegal. Throughout Ireland Masses, even public ones, were said for the three, although Bishop David Moriarty of Kerry prohibited celebration of Mass for them in his diocese.James Lydon, The Making of Ireland (Routledge 2012 ) Archbishop John MacHale of Tuam, on the other hand, personally assisted at a High Mass for them,James Fairhall, James Joyce and the Question of History (Cambridge University Press 1995 ), p. 131 and Cardinal Archbishop Paul Cullen of Dublin, while opposing public celebrations, instructed his priests to pray for the dead Fenians, and to say Mass privately for them. The day after the executions, Frederick Engels wrote to Karl Marx: > So yesterday morning the Tories, by the hand of Mr Calcraft, accomplished > the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that > the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and > G Hardy. Only the execution of the three has made the liberation of Kelly > and Deasy the heroic deed which will now be sung to every Irish babe in the > cradle in Ireland, England and America ...

Brown as a rebel, whereas here everything is being done to > transform a political attempt into a common crime.Marx and Engels in Ireland > (1971) Progress Publishers, Moscow. Letter of November 24 1867 Engels to > Marx The cry of the condemned men was the inspiration for the song \\"God Save Ireland\\", which became Ireland's unofficial national anthem until officially replaced by \\"Amhr√°n na bhFiann\\" (\\"The Soldier's Song\\"). The executions were also \\"incalculable\\" in their influence on the \\"political awakening\\" of Charles Stewart Parnell. Speaking in the House of Commons ten years later, Parnell told the House: \\"I wish to say as directly as I can that I do not believe, and never shall believe, that any murder was committed in Manchester.\\" Monuments Monument to the Manchester Martyrs in St Joseph's Cemetery, Moston, Manchester Monuments erected in honour of Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien stand in Tralee (County Kerry), Limerick, Kilrush (County Clare), Clonmel (County Tipperary), Tipperary Town (County Tipperary), Birr (County Offaly), Ennis (County Clare), Milltown Cemetery, Belfast, (County Antrim), Ladysbridge (County Cork), Glasnevin Cemetery (Dublin), and in St Joseph's Cemetery, Moston, Manchester. The monument in St Joseph's Cemetery was designed by J. Geraghty and unveiled in November 1898 (). Commissioned by the Manchester Martyrs Central Memorial Committee, it stands just over high and takes the form of a Celtic cross. On three sides of the pedestal are medallion portraits of the three men, originally surmounted by figures of the Irish Wolfhound, now removed. The site of this monument has been the scene of several disturbances, as it has been the tradition for Republican sympathisers to parade there on the anniversary of the deaths of those hanged. The monument has suffered several attacks to its structure, as well as acts of vandalism, and is listed as being \\"at risk\\" by the Public Monument and Sculpture Association National Recording Project. To commemorate the centenary of the men's execution, the Manchester Connolly Association commissioned the artist Arthur Dooley to produce a memorial sculpture to stand on the site of New Bailey prison in Salford. There was opposition to the proposal, and it seems that the sculpture was never made, let alone installed. Dooley did however produce a foot-high maquette which now forms part of the collection of the Working Class Movement Library in Manchester. The maquette suggests that the memorial was to consist of a Wicklow granite base with three standing steel pillars with attached Celtic shields each bearing a martyr's name and some detail of the event's significance. The maquette was donated to the WCML in 2011 by the family of Jud Cooper who had been given the maquette by Dooley. Police Sergeant Brett was buried in Harpurhey Cemetery; the words \\"I will do my duty\\" are engraved on his tombstone. There is also a memorial tablet to him in St Ann's Church, Manchester. pog References= Notes CitationsBibliography    * * Further reading  * External links *The Dock and the Scaffold : The Manchester Tragedy and the Cruise of the Jacknell.

The resulting bird can present with any combination of characters from the parent species, from totally identical to completely different. Usually, the bird hybrid shows intermediate characteristics between the two species. A \\"successful\\" hybrid is one demonstrated to produce fertile offspring. According to the most recent estimates, about 16% of all wild bird species have been known to hybridize with one another; this number increases to 22% when captive hybrids are taken into account. Several bird species hybridize with multiple other species. For example, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is known to interbreed with at least 40 different species. The ecological and evolutionary consequences of multispecies hybridization remain to be determined. In the wild, some of the most frequently reported hybrids are waterfowl, gulls, hummingbirds, and birds-of-paradise. Mallards, whether of wild or domestic origin, hybridize with other ducks so often that multiple duck species are at risk of extinction because of it. In gulls, Western √ó Glaucous-winged Gulls (known as \\"Olympic Gulls\\") are particularly common; these hybrids are fertile and may be more evolutionarily fit than either parent species. At least twenty different hummingbird hybrid combinations have been reported, and intergeneric hybrids are not uncommon within the family. Wood-warblers are known to hybridize as well, and an unusual three-species warbler hybrid was discovered in May 2018. Hybridisation in shorebirds is unusual but reliably recorded. Numerous gamebird, domestic fowl and duck hybrids are known. Captive songbird hybrids are sometimes called mules. Numerous hybrid macaws exist in aviculture and occasionally occur in the wild. Some of these hybrid parrots are fertile with both the parent species and other hybrids. The scientific literature on hybridization in birds has been collected at the Avian Hybrids Project. The reality of bird hybrids also calls into question modern definitions of the word \\"species\\". Throughout literature, there tends to be a general vagueness regarding the word \\"species\\" and how it should be defined. Birds serve as an excellent example of this fluidity due to the remarkable cross-breeding opportunities.

Fawkham Junction is a railway junction that currently connects High Speed 1 with the Kent Rail Network. Originally, the Junction was part of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway's line to Gravesend West (Gravesend which was already served by the South Eastern Railway's North Kent Line). The intermediate stations were: Longfield Halt, Southfleet, Rosherville Halt and Gravesend West. With the amalgamation of the two competing rail companies into the South Eastern and Chatham Railway in 1899, the future of the line was at risk. Passenger services were brought to a close and the line was not electrified, it eventually closed to passengers in 1953 and freight services finally ended in 1976. Plans to preserve the line never came to fruition. The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) gave part of the line a new lease of life with the reconstruction of the rural section near Southfleet as a spur linking the CTRL and the Chatham Main Line. Most of the original route was followed, but the initial Fawkham Junction was repositioned slightly to allow trains to run at faster speeds. Several bridges were also rebuilt alongside or in place of their originals. No stations on the line have been reopened. The CTRL was built in two stages and the initial stage (section 1) was connected to the rail network via this newly rebuilt line. The completion of section 2 to London St. Pancras International in 2007 means that Eurostar trains no longer use this line as they had their 750V DC third rail shoes removed in 2007. The line initially remained in use for engineering, non commercial trains and driver training purposes, but was previously used to store old Eurostar trains waiting to be recycled, and Fawkham Junction itself is considered disused and abandoned. In a document created by Network Rail , discussing rail transport in the coming years for Kent and South-East London, it suggests creating a southern link line from Ebbsfleet International. The scheme would bring this line and Fawkham Junction back into operation, making it possible to travel straight to Bromley South and Victoria, helping to increase passenger capacity. The line forms the boundary between the third rail (750 V DC) and overhead line (25 kV AC) systems of electrification.

Beginning in 1851 he was the administrator of Barbados and the Windward Islands. In 1852 Hamilton was appointed governor of Newfoundland. Hamilton antagonized the Newfoundland Liberal Party by impeding the decision of the British government in 1854 to grant responsible government.

Beli; O.Ir.: Bruide mac Bili) (616/628?‚Äì693) was king of the Picts from 672 until 693. Bridei may have been born as early as 616, but no later than the year 628. He was the son of Beli, King of Alt Clut. His claim to the Fortrean Kingship came through his paternal grandfather, King Nechtan of the Picts. Nennius' Historia Brittonum tells us that Bridei was King Ecgfrith's fratruelis (maternal first cousin). Bridei's mother was probably a daughter of King Edwin of Deira.Woolf, \\"Pictish matriliny reconsidered\\", pp. 160‚Äì162. Bridei was one of the more expansionist and active of Fortrean monarchs. He attacked Dunnottar in 680/681, and campaigned against the Orcadian sub-kingdom in 682, a campaign so violent that the Annals of Ulster said that the Orkney Islands were \\"destroyed\\" by Bridei (\\"Orcades deletae sunt la Bruide\\"). It is also recorded that, in the following year, in 683, war broke out between the Scots of D√°l Riata under M√°el D√∫in mac Conaill and Bridei's Picts. The Scots attacked Dundurn in Strathearn. Dundurn was Bridei's main powerbase in the south, a great 'nuclear' hilltop fortress. The Scots apparently did not take Dundurn, as Bridei responded with an attack on Dunadd, the capital of Dal Riata. We do not know if Bridei took Dunadd, but the presence of Pictish-style carvings of that time period in Dunadd may mean that he took and occupied Dunadd. The lack of reputable contemporary sources of this conflict means that not much is known about the Scottish-Pict war of 683. But it is clear that, from his base in Fortriu (or Moray), Bridei was establishing his overlordship of the lands to the north, and those to the south, perhaps putting himself in a position to attack the Anglian possessions (or overlordship) which existed in the far south. It is very possible then that Bridei was regarded by Ecgfrith as his sub-king. The traditional interpretation is that Bridei severed this relationship, causing the intervention of Ecgfrith. This led to the famous Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685, in which the Anglo-Saxon army of Ecgfrith was annihilated. One Irish source reports that Bridei was \\"fighting for his grandfather's inheritance\\",M.O. Anderson, Kings and Kingship, p. 171, n 194 suggesting that either Ecgfrith was challenging Bridei's kingship, or more likely given Bridei's earlier campaigns, that Bridei was seeking to recover the territories ruled by his grandfather in Fife and Circinn, but since taken by the English. The consequences of this battle were the expulsion of Northumbrians from southern Pictland (established through, for instance, the Anglian \\"Bishopric of the Picts\\" at Abercorn) and permanent Fortrean domination of the southern Pictish zone. Bridei's death is recorded by both the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach under the year 693. Later traditions attributed a surviving lament for Bridei's death to Saint Adomn√°n, abbot of Iona.Clancy & M√°rkus, pp. 166‚Äì168.

Left panel of by Ogata K≈çrin, 1702 Left panel of the by Hasegawa T≈çhaku, c.1595. are Japanese folding screens made from several joined panels, bearing decorative painting and calligraphy, used to separate interiors and enclose private spaces, among other uses.  History  The original form of by≈çbu exists in the Han Dynasty of China and is thought to have been imported to Japan in the 7th or 8th century. The oldest by≈çbu produced in Japan is Torige ritsujo no by≈çbu (È≥•ÊØõÁ´ãÂ•≥Â±èÈ¢®) from the 8th century, and it is stored in Sh≈çs≈çin Treasure Repository now.È≥•ÊØõÁ´ãÂ•≥Â±èÈ¢® Á¨¨1Êâá Imperial Househpld Agency After the Heian period in the 9th century, due to the development of Japan's original Kokuf≈´ Bunka (ÂõΩÈ¢®ÊñáÂåñ), the designs became more indigenous and came to be used as furnishings in the architectural style of Shinden-zukuri. *Nara period (646‚Äì794): The original form of by≈çbu was a single standing, legged panel. In the 8th century, multi-paneled by≈çbu made their appearance, and were used as furnishings in the imperial court, mainly in important ceremonies. The six-paneled by≈çbu were the most common in the Nara period, and were covered in silk and connected with leather or silk cords. The painting on each panel was framed by a silk brocade, and the panel was bound with a wood frame. *Heian period (794‚Äì1185): By the 9th century, by≈çbu were indispensable as furniture in daimy≈ç residences, Buddhist temples, and shrines. Zenigata (), coin-shaped metal hinges, were introduced and widely used to connect the panels instead of silk cords. *Muromachi period (1392‚Äì1568): Folding screens became more popular and were found in many residences, dojos, and shops. The two-panel by≈çbu were common, and overlapped paper hinges substituted for zenigata, which made them lighter to carry, easier to fold, and stronger at the joints. This technique allowed the depictions in the by≈çbu to be uninterrupted by panel vertical borders, which prompted artists to paint sumptuous, often monochromatic, nature-themed scenes and landscapes of famous Japanese locales. The paper hinges, although quite strong, required that the panel infrastructure be as light as possible. Softwood lattices were constructed using special bamboo nails that allowed for the lattice to be planed along its edges to be straight, square, and the same size as the other panels of the by≈çbu. The lattices were coated with one or more layers of paper stretched across the lattice surface like a drum head to provide a flat and strong backing for the paintings that would be later mounted on the by≈çbu. The resulting structure was lightweight and durable, yet still quite delicate. After the paintings and brocade were attached, a lacquered wood frame (typically black or dark red) was applied to protect the outer perimeter of the by≈çbu, and intricately decorated metal hardware (strips, right angles, and studs) were applied to the frame to protect the lacquer. *Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period (1568‚Äì1600) and early Edo period (1600‚Äì1868): By≈çbu popularity grew, as the people's interest in arts and crafts significantly developed during this period. By≈çbu adorned samurai residences, conveying high rank and demonstrating wealth and power. This led to radical changes in by≈çbu crafting, such as backgrounds made from and highly colorful paintings depicting nature and scenes from daily life, a style pioneered by the Kan≈ç school. *Modern period: today by≈çbu are often machine-made, however hand-crafted by≈çbu are still available, mainly produced by families that preserve the crafting traditions.  Japonism  The screens were a popular Japonism import item to Europe and America starting in the late 19th century. The French painter Odilon Redon created a series of panels for the Ch√¢teau de Domecy-sur-le-Vault in Burgundy, which were influenced by the art of by≈çbu.

The term sycamore spelled with an A has also been used for unrelated trees: the Great Maple, Acer pseudoplatanus, or plane trees, Platanus. The spelling \\"sycomore\\", with an O rather than an A as the second vowel is, if used, specific to Ficus sycomorus. Distribution Ficus sycomorus is native to Africa south of the Sahel and north of the Tropic of Capricorn, also excluding the central-west rainforest areas. It also grows naturally in Lebanon, where Beirut's famous Gemmayzeh Street is derived from the tree's Arabic name, Gemmayz; in the southern Arabian Peninsula; in Cyprus; in very localised areas in Madagascar; and in Israel, Palestine and Egypt. In its native habitat, the tree is usually found in rich soils along rivers and in mixed woodlands. Description Ficus sycomorus grows to 20 m tall and has a considerable spread as can be seen from the photograph below left, with a dense round crown of spreading branches. The leaves are heart-shaped with a round apex, 14 cm long by 10 cm wide, and arranged spirally around the twig. They are dark green above and lighter with prominent yellow veins below, and both surfaces are rough to the touch. The petiole is 0.5‚Äì3 cm long and pubescent. The fruit is a large edible fig, 2‚Äì3 cm in diameter, ripening from buff-green to yellow or red. They are borne in thick clusters on long branchlets or the leaf axil. Flowering and fruiting occurs year-round, peaking from July to December. The bark is green-yellow to orange and exfoliates in papery strips to reveal the yellow inner bark. Like all other figs, it contains a latex. Cultivation According to botanists Daniel Zohary (b. 1926) and Maria Hopf (1914‚Äì2008), the ancient Egyptians cultivated this species \\"almost exclusively.\\" Remains of F. sycomorus begin to appear in predynastic levels and in quantity from the start of the third millennium BC. It was the ancient Egyptian Tree of Life. Zohary and Hopf note that \\"the fruit and the timber, and sometimes even the twigs, are richly represented in the tombs of the Egyptian Early, Middle and Late Kingdoms.\\" In numerous cases the parched fruiting bodies, known as sycons, \\"bear characteristic gashing marks indicating that this art, which induces ripening, was practised in Egypt in ancient times.\\"Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, Domestication of plants in the Old World, third edition (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 165 Although this species of fig requires the presence of the symbiotic wasp Ceratosolen arabicus to reproduce sexually, and this insect is extinct in Egypt, Zohay and Hopf have no doubt that Egypt was \\"the principal area of sycamore fig development.\\" Some of the caskets of mummies in Egypt are made from the wood of this tree. In tropical areas where the wasp is common, complex mini-ecosystems involving the wasp, nematodes, other parasitic wasps, and various larger predators revolve around the life cycle of the fig. The trees' random production of fruit in such environments assures its constant attendance by the insects and animals which form this ecosystem. A study in 2015 indicated that the sycamore tree was brought to Israel by Philistines during the Iron Age, along with opium poppy and cumin... These sycamore trees used to be numerous in western Beirut, lending their name to the neighborhood of Gemmayzeh (, \\"sycamore figs\\").{{Citationurl=http://labnehandfacts.com/media/discoverlebanon/gemmayzeh- name-origins/title=Gemmmayzeh name origins. However, the trees have largely disappeared from this area. Gardens In the Near East F. sycomorus is an orchard and ornamental tree of great importance and very extensive use. It has wide-spreading branches and affords shade. In religion=Judaism and Christianity In the Bible, the sycomore is referred to seven times in the Old Testament [Hebrew ◊©◊ß◊û◊î shiqmah; Strong's number 8256) and once in the New Testament ( sykomoraia or sykomorea;. Strong's number 4809). Though it was not as common in Palestine, the sycomore was a very popular and valuable fruit tree in Jericho and Canaan. :Hebrew Bible *In the Psalms, sycomores are listed with vines as sources of food destroyed in the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians. **This verse implies that Ficus sycomorus could not survive in the mountainous regions of Palestine and Egypt (\\"He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.\\" Ps 78:47). * King David appointed an officer to look after the olives and sycomores of the western foothills. * King Solomon made [up-market] cedars as common as sycomores. = , * In condemning his people's arrogance the prophet Isaiah also makes a contrast between sycomores and cedars. * The prophet Amos refers to his secondary occupation as a dresser or tender of sycomores ; this involved slashing the fruits to induce ripening.Zohary & Hopf supra :Gospels * In Luke's Gospel, Zacchaeus resorted to climbing a sycomore in order to get a better view of Jesus in Jericho. :Mishnah and Talmud * In the Mishnah, in chapter 9 of tractate Shevi'it of order Zera'im, the borders of the various districts of the Land of Israel are delineated. The Upper Galilee is defined as the area north of Kfar Hananya where the sycomore does not grow; the Lower Galilee is the area south of Kfar Hananya where the sycomore does grow. * The Talmud, tractate Berakhot mentions sycomore in reference to tithing and its subsequent appropriate blessing. Other religions In Kikuyu mythology, the sycomore is a sacred tree. All sacrifices to Ngai, the supreme creator, were performed under the tree. Whenever the mugumo tree fell, it symbolised a bad omen and rituals had to be performed by elders in the society. Some of those ceremonies carried under the Mugumo tree are still observed to date.

The modern school of thought by that name arose early during World War II as a consequence of the rise of Nazi Germany. In consequence of the scale of the devastation wrought on Europe by Nazi Germany, the theory of German history has progressively gained a following inside and outside Germany, especially since the late 1960s. In particular, its proponents argue that the way Germany developed over the centuries virtually ensured the evolution of a social and political order along the lines of Nazi Germany. In their view, German mentalities, the structure of society, and institutional developments followed a different course in comparison with the other nations of the West.

This type of authoritarianism was seen to be avoiding both the autocracy of Imperial Russia and what they regarded as the weak, decadent and ineffective democratic governments of Britain and France.Hinde, John \\"Sonderweg\\" pages 934‚Äì935 from Modern Germany An Encyclopedia of History, People and Culture 1871‚Äì1990 edited by Dieter Buse and Juergen Doerr Volume 2, New York: Garland Publishing, 1998 page 935. The idea of Germany as a great Central European power, neither of the West nor of the East was to be a recurring feature of right-wing German thought right up to 1945. Historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler of the Bielefeld School places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s and 1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service. Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations ().Hans-Ulrich Wehler, (1995)  20th century = During World War II  Nazi Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and its invasion of Poland in September 1939 (the latter invasion immediately drawing France and Britain into World War II) provoked the drive to explain the phenomenon of Nazi Germany. In 1940, Sebastian Haffner, a German √©migr√© living in Britain, published Germany: Jekyll and Hyde, in which he argued it was Adolf Hitler alone, by the force of his peculiar personality, who had brought about Nazi Germany. In 1941, the British diplomat Robert Vansittart published The Black Record: Germans Past And Present, according to which Nazism was only the latest manifestation of what Vansittart argued were the exclusively German traits of aggressiveness and brutality. Other books with a thesis similar to Vansittart's were Rohan Butler's The Roots of National Socialism (1941) and William Montgomery McGovern's From Luther to Hitler: The History of Nazi- Fascist Philosophy (1946).Kershaw 2000:8  Early postwar period  After Germany's defeat in World War II in 1945, the term lost its positive connotations from the 19th century and acquired its present negative meaning. There was much debate about the origins of this \\"German catastrophe\\" (as the German historian Meinecke titled his 1946 book) of Nazi Germany's rise and fall. Since then, scholars have examined developments in intellectual, political, social, economic and cultural history to investigate why German democracy failed during the Weimar Republic and which factors led to the rise of National Socialism. In the 1960s, many historians concluded that the failure of Germany to develop firm democratic institutions in the 19th century had been decisive for the failure of the Weimar Republic in the 20th century. Until the mid-1960s, the debate was polarized with most non-German participants at one pole and German participants at the other. Historians like L√©on Poliakov, A. J. P. Taylor, and Sir Lewis Bernstein Namier, echoed by journalists like the American William L. Shirer, portrayed Nazism as the inevitable result of German history, reflecting unique flaws in \\"German national character\\" that went back to the days of Martin Luther, if not earlier. During the Raleigh Lecture on History in 1944, Namier stated that the German liberals in the Revolution of 1848 were \\"in reality forerunners of Hitler\\", whose views about the Poles and Czechs presaged the great international crises of 1938‚Äì39, and called the 1848 revolution \\"a touchstone of German mentality and a decisive element in East-European politics\\" In his lecture, Namier described the 1848 revolution as \\"the early manifestations of aggressive nationalism, especially of German nationalism which derives from the much belauded Frankfort Parliament rather than from Bismarck and \\"Prussianism\\". Namier concluded \\"had not Hitler and his associates blindly accepted the legend which latter-day liberals, German and foreign had spun around 1848, they might well have found a great deal to extol in the of the Frankfort Assembly\\". Taylor wrote in his 1945 book The Course of German History that the Nazi regime \\"represented the deepest wishes of the German people\\", and that it was the first and only German government created by the Germans as the Holy Roman Empire had been created by France and Austria, the German Confederation by Austria and Prussia and the Weimar Republic by the Allies.Taylor, A.J.P. The Course of German History, Hamish Hamilton 1945 page 213. By contrast, Taylor argued \\"But the Third Reich rested solely on German force and impulse; it owed nothing to alien forces. It was a tyranny imposed upon the German people by themselves\\". Taylor argued that National Socialism was inevitable because the Germans wanted \\"to repudiate the equality with the peoples of eastern Europe which had then been forced upon them\\" after 1918.Taylor, A.J.P. The Course of German History, Hamish Hamilton 1945 pages 213‚Äì214. Taylor wrote that: > During the preceding eighty years the Germans had sacrificed to the all > their liberties; they demanded as a reward the enslavement of others. No > German recognized the Czechs or Poles as equals. Therefore, every German > desired the achievement which only total war could give. By no other means > could the Reich be held together.

Shirer in his 1960 book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich argued for the view that German history proceeded logically from \\"Luther to Hitler\\",\\"The notion that 'rectitude and authenticity [were] integrally German attributes in contrast to Roman or Latin influences which were degrading' held to have originated with Luther developed with German Romanticism in the 19th Century and culminated with National Socialism.\\" Johnson 2001 seeing Hitler's rise to power as an expression of German character, rather than of the international phenomenon of totalitarianism.Shirer pg. 236Rosenfeld 1994, pp. 101‚Äì102Evans 2004, pg. xxiv Shirer encapsulated this view with the passage, \\"...the course of German history... made blind obedience to temporal rulers the highest virtue of Germanic man and put a premium on servility.\\"Shirer, pg. 1080 The French historian Edmond Vermeil wrote in his 1952 book (\\"Contemporary Germany\\") that Nazi Germany was not \\"a purely adventitious episode appearing on the fringes of the German tradition\\" Instead, Vermeil contended that German nationalism had an especially aggressive character, which had been restrained only by Bismarck. After Bismarck's dismissal in 1890, Vermeil wrote \\"It was after his fall, under William II, that this nationalism, breaking all barriers and escaping from the grip of a weak government, gave rise to a state of mind and a general situation that we have to analyze, for otherwise Nazism with its momentary triumphs and its terrible collapse will remain incomprehensible\\".Hamerow, Theodore \\"Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History\\" pages 53‚Äì72 from The American Historical Review, 1983 pages 56-57. Vermeil concluded that Germany will remain on a separate path, \\"always placing the spirit of its implacable technical discipline at the service of those visions of the future that its eternal romanticism begets\\". Poliakov wrote that even if not all Germans supported the Holocaust, it was \\"tacitly accepted by the popular will\\"Marrus, Michael The Holocaust in History, Key Porter: Toronto 2000 page 86. In contrast, German historians such as Friedrich Meinecke, Hans Rothfels, and Gerhard Ritter, joined by a few non-German historians such as Pieter Geyl, contended that the Nazi period had no relationship to earlier periods of German history, and that German traditions were at sharp variance with the totalitarianism of the Nazi movement. Meinecke famously described National Socialism in his 1946 book (\\"The German Catastrophe\\") as a particularly unfortunate (\\"on-the-job accident\\") of history.Kershaw 2000:7 Although opposed to what they regarded as Meinecke's excessively defensive tone, Ritter and Rothfels have been joined by their intellectual heirs Klaus Hildebrand, Karl Dietrich Bracher, and Henry Ashby Turner in contending that though the Nazi dictatorship was rooted in the German past, it was individual choices made during the later Weimar years that led to the Nazi years. Though Bracher is opposed to the interpretation of German history, he does believe in a special German mentality () that emerged in the late 18th century.Lukacs, John The Hitler of History, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997 page 201. Bracher wrote that: > The German \\"\\" should be limited to the era of the Third Reich, but the > strength of the particular German mentality [] that had arisen already with > its opposition to the French Revolution and grew stronger after 1870 and > 1918 must be emphasized.

During the latter half of the German Empire, from about 1890 to 1918, this pride, they argued, developed into hubris. Since 1950, historians such as Fischer, Wehler, and Hans Mommsen have drawn a harsh indictment of the German elite of the period 1870‚Äì1945, who were accused of promoting authoritarian values, being solely responsible for launching World War I, sabotaging the democratic Weimar Republic, and aiding and abetting the Nazi dictatorship in internal repression, war, and genocide. In the view of Wehler, Fischer, and their supporters, only the German defeat in 1945 put an end to the \\"premodern\\" social structure which had led to and then sustained traditional German authoritarianism and its more radical variant, National Socialism. Wehler has asserted that the effects of the traditional power elite in maintaining power up to 1945 \\"and in many respects even beyond that\\" took the form of: > a penchant for authoritarian politics; a hostility toward democracy in the > educational and party system; the influence of preindustrial leadership > groups, values and ideas; the tenacity of German state ideology; the myth of > the bureaucracy; the superimposition of caste tendencies and class > distinctions; and the manipulation of political antisemitism.Hamerow, > Theodore S. \\"Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History\\" pages 53-72 from > The American Historical Review, February 1983, Volume 88 pages 67-68. Another version of the thesis emerged in the United States in the 1950s-1960s, when historians such as Fritz Stern and George Mosse examined ideas and culture in 19th-century Germany, especially those of the virulently anti- Semitic movement. Mosse and Stern both concluded that the intellectual and cultural elites in Germany by and large chose to consciously reject modernity and along with it those groups they identified with modernity, such as Jews, and embraced anti-Semitism as the basis for their (world-view). However, in recent years, Stern has abandoned his conclusion and now argues against the thesis, holding the views of the movement to be a mere \\"dark undercurrent\\" in Imperial Germany. In 1990, J√ºrgen Kocka wrote about the s theories: > Yet, at the same time, researches looked back to the eighteenth and > nineteenth centuries to uncover the deeper roots of the Third Reich. Through > comparisons with England, France, the United States, or simply \\"the West\\", > they attempted to identify the peculiarities of Germany history, those > structures and processes, experiences, and turning points, which while they > may not have led directly to National Socialism, nevertheless hindered the > long term development of liberal democracy in Germany and eventually > facilitated the triumph of fascism. Many authors made various contributions > to the elaboration of this argument, usually without actually using the word > . Helmuth Plessner, for example, spoke of the \\"belated nation\\" (), the delayed creation of a nation-state from above. Other historians have argued that nationalism played an especially aggressive, precociously right-wing destructive role during the Second Empire. Ernst Fraenkel, the young Karl Dietrich Bracher, Gerhard A. Ritter, M. Rainer Lepsius, and others identified powerful long-term weaknesses in the Empire's system of government: the blocked development of parliamentarianism, the severely fragmented system of parties that resembled self-contained blocks, and other factors that later burdened Weimar and contributed to its breakdown. Leonard Krieger, Fritz Stern, George Mosse and Kurt Sontheimer emphasized the illiberal, antipluralistic elements in German political culture upon which National Socialist ideas could later build. Hans Rosenberg and others argued that preindustrial elites, especially the east Elbian landowners (the Junkers), upper-level civil servants and the officer corps retained great power and influence well into the twentieth century. In the long term, they represented an obstacle to democratization and parliamentarianism. As Heinrich August Winkler has shown, their effort is visible in the pernicious role played by agrarian interests in the collapse of the Weimar Republic. The unification of Germany by means of \\"blood and iron\\" under Prussian hegemony expanded the political influence and social weight of the officer corps with its status- oriented claims to exclusivity and autonomy. Along with the old elites, many traditional and preindustrial norms, ways of thinking and modes of life also survived. These included the authoritarian outlook and antiproletarian claims of the petty bourgeoise as well as militaristic elements of middle-class political culture, such as the institution of the \\"reserve officer\\". The liberal Max Weber criticized the \\"feudalization\\" of the upper bourgeoisie, which seemed to accept both the disproportional representation of the nobility in politics as well as aristocratic norms and practices instead of striving for power on its own terms or cultivating a distinctly middle-class culture. Lacking the experience of a successful revolution from below, schooled in a long tradition of bureaucratically led reforms from above, and challenged by a growing workers' movement, the German bourgeoise appeared relatively weak and‚Äîcompared with the West‚Äîalmost \\"unbourgeois\\"Kocka, J√ºrgen \\"German Identity and Historical Comparison: After the \\" pages 279-294 from Reworking the Past edited by Peter Baldwin, Beacon Press: Boston, 1990 pages 283-284 Another variant of the theory has been provided by Michael St√ºrmer who, echoing claims of conservative historians during the Imperial and Weimar periods, argues that it was geography that was the key to German history. St√ºrmer contends that what he regards as Germany's precarious geographical situation in the heart of Central Europe left successive German governments no other choice but to engage in authoritarianism. St√ºrmer's views have been very controversial; they would become one of the central issues in the notorious (\\"Historians' Quarrel\\") of the mid-1980s. One of St√ºrmer's leading critics, J√ºrgen Kocka, himself a proponent of the view of history, argued that \\"Geography is not destiny\\",Kocka, J√ºrgen \\"Hitler Should Not Be Repressed by Stalin and Pol Pot\\" pages 85-92 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands: Humanities Press, 1993 page 91. suggesting that the reasons for the were political and cultural instead. Kocka wrote against St√ºrmer that both Switzerland and Poland were also \\"lands in the middle\\", and yet neither country went in the same authoritarian direction as Germany.  Subdebate over Holocaust  In his 1992 book Ordinary Men, Christopher Browning opposed the theory that Germans in the Nazi era were motivated by the especially virulent anti-Semitism that had characterized German culture for centuries. Analyzing the troops of the special police battalion units, who were the ones who directly killed Jews in the mass raids phase of the Holocaust (prior to the death camps), Browning concluded that these typical middle class workers were not ingrained with anti-Semitism, but rather became killers through peer pressure and indoctrination. The debate on the was renewed by American scholar Daniel Goldhagen with his 1996 book, Hitler's Willing Executioners. Goldhagen countered that German society, politics, and life up until 1945 were characterized by a unique version of extreme anti- Semitism that held the murder of Jews as the highest possible national value. His critics (e.g., Yehuda Bauer) replied that Goldhagen ignored most recent research and ignored other developments both in Germany and abroad.Bauer, Yehuda. Rethinking the Holocaust. 2002, page 99-102 Ruth Bettina Birn asserts that Goldhagen \\"allow[ed] his thesis to dictate his presentation of the evidence\\".Cesarani, David and Kavanaugh, Sarah. Holocaust. 2004, page 363 Nonetheless, Goldhagen is often held to have succeeded in reviving the debate on the question of a German \\"collective guilt\\", and, in Germany, of bringing many Germans to a modern confrontation with, and a lively and fruitful debate about, the legacy of the Holocaust.  Criticism  The leading critics of the thesis have been two British Marxist historians, Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn, who in their 1984 book The Peculiarities of German History (first published in German in 1980 as ) argued that there is no normal course of social and political change; that the experience of France and Britain in the 19th century was not the norm for Europe; and that even if the liberal German middle class was disempowered at the national political level, it nevertheless dominated the social, economic and cultural life of 19th-century Germany. This embourgeoisement of German social life was greater than in Britain and France, which in the opinion of Eley and Blackbourn was more distinctly marked by aristocratic values than was Germany. They rejected the entire concept of the as a flawed construct supported by \\"a curious mixture of idealistic analysis and vulgar materialism\\" that led to an \\"exaggerated linear continuity between the nineteenth century and the 1930s\\".Hamerow, Theodore S. \\"Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History\\" pages 53-72 from The American Historical Review, February 1983, Volume 88 page 71 In the view of Blackbourn and Eley, there was no , and it is ahistorical to judge why Germany did not become Britain for the simple reason that Germany is Germany and Britain is Britain. Moreover, Eley and Blackbourn argued that after 1890 there was a tendency towards greater democratization in German society with the growth of civil society as reflected in the growth of trade unions and a more or less free press. From the right, Otto Pflanze claimed that Wehler's use of such terms as \\"Bonapartism\\", \\"social imperialism\\", \\"negative integration\\" and (\\"the politics of rallying together\\") has gone beyond mere heuristic devices and instead become a form of historical fiction.Hamerow, Theodore S. \\"Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History\\" pages 53-72 from The American Historical Review, February 1983, Volume 88 page 68 The German conservative historian Thomas Nipperdey in a 1975 book review of Wehler's , argued that Wehler presented German elites as more united than they were, focused too much on forces from above and not enough on forces from below in 19th-century German society, and presented too stark a contrast between the forces of order and stabilization versus the forces of democracy with no explanation for the relative stability of the Empire. In Nipperdey's opinion, Wehler's work fails to explain how the Weimar Republic occurred, since, according to Wehler, prior to 1918 the forces of authoritarianism were so strong and those of democracy so weak. Nipperdey concluded his review that a proper history of the Imperial period could only be written by placing German history in a comparative European and trans- Atlantic perspective, which might allow for \\"our fixation on the struggle with our great-grandfathers\\" to end. Many scholars have disputed Eley's and Blackbourn's conclusions, among them J√ºrgen Kocka and Wolfgang Mommsen. Kocka in particular has argued that while the thesis may not explain the reasons for the rise of the Nazi movement, it still explains the failure of the democratic Weimar Republic. This seems to entail that the issue of the is limited to an individual development (albeit of a type frequently encountered). Detlev Peukert in his influential 1987 (English translation 1992) work The Weimar Republic: The Crisis of Classical Modernity suggested Germany's experience was a crisis involving socio-political phenomena common to all modernising countries.  German history before 1806  Schubert statesErnst Schubert, K√∂nigsabsetzungen im Mittelalter, G√∂ttingen 2005, p.18 that the history of the Holy Roman Empire is not to be confused with the , which can only be seen as a result of the concept of German identity, developing in the Romanticism of the late 18th century, reinforced by the Napoleonic Wars in which Germany was under French occupation. Previous events, especially those of the Holy Roman Empire,as attempted by Timothy Reuter, in: Anne Duggan, Kings and Kingship in Medieval Europe, London 1993, p.179-211 cannot be related to the evolution of Nazism.

Today he is most known as a trainer of both horses and riders, and as a retired president of the AHSA and vice-president of the USET. Wofford now lives on his Fox Covert Farm in Upperville, Virginia, with his wife, Gail W. Wofford ex-MFH, of almost 40 years. Family Wofford was born in Junction City, Kansas to an equestrian family. His father Col. John W. Wofford, who died when James was 10, rode for the United States Show Jumping Team in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic Games. Col. Wofford went on to coach eventers and show jumpers at the 1952 Helsinki Olympic Games. This was the first Olympics where civilians were permitted to participate in eventing, and nineteen-year- old Jeb Wofford‚ÄîCol. Wofford‚Äôs son and James‚Äô brother‚Äîwon a bronze medal. Col. Wofford was also the founder and first president of the United States Equestrian Team. The second brother to James, Warren Wofford, remains the only USET rider to qualify in both show jumping and eventing. He chose show jumping, but only went as an alternate to the 1956 Stockholm Games. However, Warren did meet his future wife, Dawn Penelope Wofford, who competed on the British Show Jumping Team in the 1956 and 1960 Olympic Games. Wofford‚Äôs cousin is both a trainer and rider of flat and steeplechase races. Several members of his family have also been Masters of Foxhounds. Early life Wofford attended Culver Military Academy for high school. He later went to graduate from the University of Colorado School of Business. Riding career Wofford has had a successful riding career, joining the USA Eventing Team in 1965 and remaining a member until 1985. During this time, he trained under Bert de Nemethy and Jack Le Goff. Wofford competed in the 1968 and 1972 Olympic Games on his famous horse Kilkenny, winning team silver both times, and was also named to the 1980 Olympic Games but did not compete due to the Olympic Committee's boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. He was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal many years after. He also competed on the US Eventing Team at the 1970 World Championships at Punchestown, Ireland, winning an individual bronze with Kilkenny, and at the 1978 World Championship with Carawich, winning a team bronze. Wofford‚Äôs records also include five wins‚Äîeach on a different horse‚Äîat five US National Championships, a team gold medal at the 1967 Pan Am Games, and two wins at the Rolex Kentucky Three Day (1981 with Carawich and 1986 with The Optimist ‚Äîremarkably coming out of retirement to ride the horse for student and fellow Olympian, Karen O'Connor). He also competed very successfully abroad from 1959‚Äì1986. In all, Wofford competed at the advanced level over 20 years. During this time, he also raced as a steeplechase jockey, and fox hunted for over 20 years. Wofford retired as a competitor in 1986. He continues to ride, along with his wife, two daughters, and three grandsons. Coaching career Perhaps even more impressive than his riding career is his career as a coach. Wofford began focusing on coaching after his retirement, and has produced riders on nearly every USET Eventing team. He has had at least one student on every US Olympic, World Championship, or Pan Am team since 1978. Today he is sought after as a clinician. Notable record of his achievements as a coach include: * 2004 Athens Olympics: Kimberly Severson and John Williams were both former students. Severson went on to win the individual silver. The team won bronze. Also coached the Canadian team. * 2003 Pan Am Games, as coach for the silver medal-winning Canadian team. * 2002 World Equestrian Games in Jerez, Spain, where he coached the Canadian team. The gold medal US team also had former students Kim Vinoski-Severson, David O'Connor and John Williams. * 2000 Sydney Olympics, where all four US team members‚ÄîDavid O'Connor, Karen O'Connor, Nina Fout and Linden Wiesman‚Äîhad trained with Wofford. David O‚ÄôConnor went on to win the individual gold medal, and the team won bronze. * Wofford was named United States Olympic Committee development coach of the year in 1998 and 1999. Other involvements James Wofford has written a number of books, including Gymnastics: Systematic Training for Jumping Horses, and Training the Three-Day Event Horse and Rider, 101 Eventing Tips, and Take a Good Look Around. He has also served on many equestrian committees, including: * AHSA (now USEF) as president * USET: the first vice-president * USCTA (now USEA) secretary * Member of the FEI Eventing Committee for two terms, including two years as vice-chairman * He does many clinics all over the US Wofford has also been inducted into the US Eventing Hall of Fame and the Culver Academies Horsemanship Hall of Fame.

Despite the name, it is considered more a branch of set theory than of model theory.  Examples  *The class of all sets is an inner model containing all other inner models. *The first non-trivial example of an inner model was the constructible universe L developed by Kurt G√∂del. Every model M of ZF has an inner model LM satisfying the axiom of constructibility, and this will be the smallest inner model of M containing all the ordinals of M.

The name was changed in 1920 to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei ‚Äì NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the Nazi Party). It was anti-Marxist and opposed to the democratic post-war government of the Weimar Republic and the Treaty of Versailles, advocating extreme nationalism and Pan-Germanism as well as virulent anti-Semitism. Hitler attained power in March 1933, after the Reichstag adopted the Enabling Act of 1933 in that month, giving expanded authority. President Paul von Hindenburg had already appointed Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 after a series of parliamentary elections and associated backroom intrigues. The Enabling Actwhen used ruthlessly and with authorityvirtually assured that Hitler could thereafter constitutionally exercise dictatorial power without legal objection. Hitler rose to a place of prominence in the early years of the party. Being one of its best speakers, he was made leader after he threatened to leave otherwise. He was aided in part by his willingness to use violence in advancing his political objectives and to recruit party members who were willing to do the same. The Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923 and the later release of his book Mein Kampf (My Struggle) expanded Hitler's audience. In the mid-1920s, the party engaged in electoral battles in which Hitler participated as a speaker and organizer, as well as in street battles and violence between the Communist's Rotfrontk√§mpferbund and the Nazis' Sturmabteilung (SA). Through the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Nazis gathered enough electoral support to become the largest political party in the Reichstag, and Hitler's blend of political acuity, deceptiveness, and cunning converted the party's non-majority but plurality status into effective governing power in the ailing Weimar Republic of 1933. Once in power, the Nazis created a mythology surrounding their rise to power, and they described the period that roughly corresponds to the scope of this article as either the Kampfzeit (the time of struggle) or the Kampfjahre (years of struggle). Early steps (1918‚Äì1924) Adolf Hitler became involved with the fledgling Nazi Party after the First World War, and set the violent tone of the movement early, by forming the Sturmabteilung (SA) paramilitary. Catholic Bavaria resented rule from Protestant Berlin, and Hitler at first saw revolution in Bavaria as a means to powerbut an early attempt proved fruitless, and he was imprisoned after the 1923 Munich Beerhall Putsch. He used the time to write Mein Kampf, in which he argued that effeminate Jewish-Christian ethics were enfeebling Europe, and that Germany needed a man of iron to restore itself and build an empire. He decided on the tactic of pursuing power through legal means. From Armistice (November 1918) to party membership (September 1919) February 1919 United States News coverage of the unrest in Germany After being granted permission from King Ludwig III of Bavaria, 25-year-old Austrian-born Hitler enlisted in a Bavarian regiment of the German Army, although he was not yet a German citizen. For over four years (August 1914 ‚Äì November 1918), Germany was a principal nation involved in World War I on the Western Front. After the fighting on the front ended in November 1918, on 19 November, Hitler was discharged from the Pasewalk hospital and returned to Munich, which at the time was in a state of socialist upheaval. Arriving on 21 November, he was assigned to 7th Company of the 1st Replacement Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. In December he was reassigned to a Prisoner of War camp in Traunstein as a guard. There he would stay until the camp dissolved January 1919. He returned to Munich and spent a few months in barracks waiting for reassignment. During this time in Munich there were a number of assassinations, including socialist Kurt Eisner who was shot dead by a German nationalist on 21 February 1919. His rival Erhard Auer was also wounded in an attack. Other acts of violence were the killings of both Major Paul Ritter von Jahrei√ü and the conservative MP Heinrich Osel. In this political chaos Berlin sent in the military ‚Äì called the \\"White Guards of Capitalism\\" by the communists. On 3 April 1919, Hitler was elected as the liaison of his military battalion and again on 15 April. During this time he urged his unit to stay out of the fighting and not join either side. The Bavarian Soviet Republic was officially crushed on 6 May 1919, when Lt. General Burghard von Oven and his forces declared the city secure. In the aftermath of arrests and executions, Hitler denounced a fellow liaison, Georg Dufter, as a Soviet \\"radical rabble- rouser.\\" Other testimony he gave to the military board of inquiry allowed them to root out other members of the military that \\"had been infected with revolutionary fervor.\\" For his anti-communist views he was allowed to avoid discharge when his unit was disbanded in May 1919. In June 1919, Hitler was moved to the demobilization office of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Around this time the German military command released an edict that the army's main priority was to \\"carry out, in conjunction with the police, stricter surveillance of the population ... so that the ignition of any new unrest can be discovered and extinguished.\\" In May 1919 Karl Mayr became commander of the 6th Battalion of the guards regiment in Munich and from 30 May the head of the \\"Education and Propaganda Department\\" of the General Command von Oven and the Group Command No. 4 (Department Ib). In this capacity as head of the intelligence department, Mayr recruited Hitler as an undercover agent in early June 1919. Under Captain Mayr \\"national thinking\\" courses were arranged at the Reichswehrlager Lechfeld near Augsburg, with Hitler attending from 10‚Äì19 July. During this time Hitler so impressed Mayr that he assigned him to an anti- bolshevik \\"educational commando\\" as 1 of 26 instructors in the summer of 1919. In July 1919 Hitler was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufkl√§rungskommando (reconnaissance commando) of the Reichswehr, both to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP). The DAP had been formed by Anton Drexler, Karl Harrer and others, through amalgamation of other groups, on 5 January 1919 at a small gathering in Munich at the restaurant Fuerstenfelder Hof. While he studied the activities of the DAP, Hitler became impressed with Drexler's antisemitic, nationalist, anti- capitalist and anti-Marxist ideas. Hitler's membership card for the German Workers' Party (DAP) During the 12 September 1919 meeting, Hitler took umbrage with comments made by an audience member that were directed against Gottfried Feder, the speaker, a crank economist with whom Hitler was acquainted due to a lecture Feder delivered in an army \\"education\\" course. The audience member (Hitler in Mein Kampf disparagingly called him the \\"professor\\") asserted that Bavaria should be wholly independent from Germany and should secede from Germany and unite with Austria to form a new South German nation. The volatile Hitler arose and scolded the unfortunate Professor Baumann, using his speaking skills and eventually causing Baumann to leave the meeting before its adjournment. Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party. Within a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a member and he should come to a \\"committee\\" meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the \\"committee\\" meeting held at the run-down Alte Rosenbad beer-house. Later Hitler wrote that joining the fledgling party \\"...was the most decisive resolve of my life. From here there was and could be no turning back. ... I registered as a member of the German Workers' Party and received a provisional membership card with the number 7\\". Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. However, in this case, Hitler had Captain Mayr's permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks. From early party membership to the Hofbr√§uhaus Mel√©e (November 1921) By early 1920, the DAP had grown to over 101 members, and Hitler received his membership card as member number 555. Hitler's considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership. With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920 and his actions began to transform the party. He organised their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people, on 24 February 1920 in the Staatliches Hofbr√§uhaus in M√ºnchen. There Hitler announced the party's 25-point program (see National Socialist Program). He engineered the name change of the DAP to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei ‚Äì NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party), commonly known to the rest of the world as the Nazi Party. Hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background. Hitler was later discharged from the army in March 1920 and began working full-time for the Nazi Party. In 1920, a small \\"hall protection\\" squad was organised around Emil Maurice. The group was first named the \\"Order troops\\" (Ordnertruppen). Later in August 1921, Hitler redefined the group, which became known as the \\"Gymnastic and Sports Division\\" of the party (Turn- und Sportabteilung). By the autumn of 1921 the group was being called the Sturmabteilung (Storm Detachment) or SA, and in November 1921 the group was officially known by that name. In 1920, Hitler also began to lecture in Munich beer halls, particularly the Hofbr√§uhaus, Sterneckerbr√§u and B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller. Only Hitler was able to bring in the crowds for the party speeches and meetings. By this time, the police were already monitoring the speeches, and their own surviving records reveal that Hitler delivered lectures with titles such as Political Phenomenon, Jews and the Treaty of Versailles. At the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000. In June 1921, while Hitler and Dietrich Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich, its organizational home. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful: at a general membership meeting, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, with only one nay vote cast. On 14 September 1921, Hitler and a substantial number of SA members and other Nazi Party adherents disrupted a meeting at the L√∂wenbr√§ukeller of the Bavarian League. This federalist organization objected to the centralism of the Weimar Constitution but accepted its social program. The League was led by Otto Ballerstedt, an engineer whom Hitler regarded as \\"my most dangerous opponent\\". One Nazi, Hermann Esser, climbed upon a chair and shouted that the Jews were to blame for the misfortunes of Bavaria and the Nazis shouted demands that Ballerstedt yield the floor to Hitler. The Nazis beat up Ballerstedt and shoved him off the stage into the audience. Hitler and Esser were arrested and Hitler commented notoriously to the police commissioner, \\"It's all right. We got what we wanted. Ballerstedt did not speak\\". Hitler was eventually sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and ended up serving only a little over one month. On 4 November 1921, the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich Hofbr√§uhaus. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a mel√©e in which a small company of SA defeated the opposition. From Beer Hall mel√©e to Beer Hall coup d'√©tat Defendants in the Beer Hall Putsch In 1922 and early 1923, Hitler and the Nazi Party formed two organizations that would grow to have huge significance. The first began as the Jungsturm Adolf Hitler and the Jugendbund der NSDAP; they would later become the Hitler Youth. The other was the Stabswache (Staff Guard), which in May 1923 was renamed the Sto√ütrupp-Hitler (Shock Troop-Hitler). This early incarnation of a bodyguard unit for Hitler would later become the Schutzstaffel (SS). Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome in 1922, Hitler decided that a coup d'√©tat was the proper strategy to seize control of the country. In May 1923, elements loyal to Hitler within the army helped the SA to procure a barracks and its weaponry, but the order to march never came. A pivotal moment came when Hitler led the Beer Hall Putsch, an attempted coup d'√©tat on 8‚Äì9 November 1923. Sixteen Nazi Party members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup. Hitler was arrested on 11 November 1923. Hitler was put on trial for high treason, gaining great public attention. The rather spectacular trial began in February 1924. Hitler endeavored to turn the tables and put democracy and the Weimar Republic on trial as traitors to the German people. Hitler was convicted and on 1 April sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. Hitler received friendly treatment from the guards; he had a room with a view of the river, wore a tie, had regular visitors to his chambers, was allowed mail from supporters and was permitted the use of a private secretary. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. Hitler used the time in Landsberg Prison to consider his political strategy and dictate the first volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice), principally to his deputy Rudolf Hess. After the putsch the party was banned in Bavaria, but it participated in 1924's two elections by proxy as the National Socialist Freedom Movement. In the May 1924 German federal election the party gained seats in the Reichstag, with 6.6% (1,918,329) voting for the Movement. In the December 1924 federal election, the National Socialist Freedom Movement (NSFB) (combination of the Deutschv√∂lkische Freiheitspartei (DVFP) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP)) lost 18 seats, only holding on to 14 seats, with 3% (907,242) of the electorate voting for Hitler's party. The Barmat Scandal was often used later in Nazi propaganda, both as an electoral strategy and as an appeal to anti-Semitism. After some reflection, Hitler had determined that power was to be achieved not through revolution outside of the government, but rather through legal means, within the confines of the democratic system established by Weimar. For five to six years, there would be no further prohibitions of the party. Move towards power (1925‚Äì1930) In the May 1928 federal election, the party achieved just 12 seats in the Reichstag. The highest provincial gain was again in Bavaria (5.1%), though in three areas the Nazis failed to gain even 1% of the vote. Overall the Party gained 2.6% (810,100) of the vote. Partially due to the poor results, Hitler decided that Germans needed to know more about his goals. Despite being discouraged by his publisher, he wrote a second book that was discovered and released posthumously as the Zweites Buch. At this time the SA began a period of deliberate antagonism to the Rotfront by marching into Communist strongholds and starting violent altercations. At the end of 1928, party membership was recorded at 130,000. In March 1929, Erich Ludendorff represented the Nazi Party in the Presidential elections. He gained 280,000 votes (1.1%), and was the only candidate to poll fewer than a million votes. The battles on the streets grew increasingly violent. After the Rotfront interrupted a speech by Hitler, the SA marched into the streets of Nuremberg and killed two bystanders. In a tit-for-tat action, the SA stormed a Rotfront meeting on 25 August and days later the Berlin headquarters of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) itself. In September Goebbels led his men into Neuk√∂lln, a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire. The German referendum of 1929 was important as it gained the Nazi Party recognition and credibility it never had before.Nicholls, A.J. (2000) Weimar and the Rise of Hitler. London: Palgrave MacMillan. p. 138 On the evening of 14 January 1930, at around ten o'clock, Horst Wessel was fatally shot at point-blank range in the face by two members of the KPD in Friedrichshain. The attack occurred after an argument with his landlady who was a member of the KPD, and contacted one of her Rotfront friends, Albert Hochter, who shot Wessel. Wessel had penned a song months before which would become a Nazi anthem as the Horst-Wessel-Lied. Goebbels seized upon the attack (and the weeks Wessel spent on his deathbed) to publicize the song, and the funeral was used as an anti-Communist propaganda opportunity for the Nazis. In May, Goebbels was convicted of \\"libeling\\" President Hindenburg and fined 800 marks. It stemmed from a 1929 article by Goebbels in his newspaper Der Angriff. In June, Goebbels was charged with high treason by the prosecutor in Leipzig based on statements Goebbels had made in 1927, but after a four-month investigation it came to naught. Hitler with Nazi Party members in December 1930 Against this backdrop, Hitler's party gained a victory in the Reichstag, obtaining 107 seats (18.3%, 6,409,600 votes) in the September 1930 federal election. The Nazis became the second largest party in Germany. In Bavaria the party gained 17.9% of the vote, though for the first time this percentage was exceeded by most other provinces: Oldenburg (27.3%), Braunschweig (26.6%), Waldeck (26.5%), Mecklenburg-Strelitz (22.6%), Lippe (22.3%) Mecklenburg- Schwerin (20.1%), Anhalt (19.8%), Thuringen (19.5%), Baden (19.2%), Hamburg (19.2%), Prussia (18.4%), Hessen (18.4%), Sachsen (18.3%), Lubeck (18.3%) and Schaumburg-Lippe (18.1%). An unprecedented amount of money was thrown behind the campaign. Well over one million pamphlets were produced and distributed; sixty trucks were commandeered for use in Berlin alone. In areas where Nazi campaigning was less rigorous, the total was as low as 9%. The Great Depression was also a factor in Hitler's electoral success. Against this legal backdrop, the SA began its first major anti-Jewish action on 13 October 1930 when groups of brownshirts smashed the windows of Jewish-owned stores at Potsdamer Platz. Weimar parties fail to halt Nazis The Wall Street Crash of 1929 heralded worldwide economic disaster. The Nazis and the Communists made great gains at the 1930 federal election. The Nazis and Communists between them secured almost 40% of Reichstag seats, which required the moderate parties to consider negotiations with anti-democrats. \\"The Communists\\", wrote historian Alan Bullock, \\"openly announced that they would prefer to see the Nazis in power rather than lift a finger to save the republic\\". The Weimar political parties failed to stop the Nazi rise. Germany's Weimar political system made it difficult for chancellors to govern with a stable parliamentary majority, and successive chancellors instead relied on the president's emergency powers to govern. From 1931 to 1933, the Nazis combined terror tactics with conventional campaigning ‚Äì Hitler criss- crossed the nation by air, while SA troops paraded in the streets, beat up opponents, and broke up their meetings. A middle-class liberal party strong enough to block the Nazis did not exist ‚Äì the People's Party and the Democrats suffered severe losses to the Nazis at the polls. The Social Democrats were essentially a conservative trade union party, with ineffectual leadership. The Catholic Centre Party maintained its voting block, but was preoccupied with defending its own particular interests and, wrote Bullock: \\"through 1932‚Äì3 ... was so far from recognizing the danger of a Nazi dictatorship that it continued to negotiate with the Nazis\\". The Communists meanwhile were engaging in violent clashes with Nazis on the streets, but Moscow had directed the Communist Party to prioritise destruction of the Social Democrats, seeing more danger in them as a rival for the loyalty of the working class. Nevertheless, wrote Bullock, the heaviest responsibility lay with the German right wing, who \\"forsook a true conservatism\\" and made Hitler their partner in a coalition government. Chancellor Franz von Papen (left) with his eventual successor, the Minister of Defence Kurt von Schleicher The Centre Party's Heinrich Br√ºning was Chancellor from 1930 to 1932. Br√ºning and Hitler were unable to reach terms of co-operation, but Br√ºning himself increasingly governed with the support of the President and Army over that of the parliament. The 84-year-old President von Hindenburg, a conservative monarchist, was reluctant to take action to suppress the Nazis, while the ambitious Major-General Kurt von Schleicher, as Minister handling army and navy matters hoped to harness their support. With Schleicher's backing, and Hitler's stated approval, Hindenburg appointed the Catholic monarchist Franz von Papen to replace Br√ºning as Chancellor in June 1932. Papen had been active in the resurgence of the Harzburg Front. He had fallen out with the Centre Party. He hoped ultimately to outmaneuver Hitler. At the July 1932 federal election, the Nazis became the largest party in the Reichstag, yet without a majority. Hitler withdrew support for Papen and demanded the Chancellorship. He was refused by Hindenburg. Papen dissolved Parliament, and the Nazi vote declined at the November Election. In the aftermath of the election, Papen proposed ruling by decree while drafting a new electoral system, with an upper house. Schleicher convinced Hindenburg to sack Papen, and Schleicher himself became Chancellor, promising to form a workable coalition. The aggrieved Papen opened negotiations with Hitler, proposing a Nazi-Nationalist Coalition. Having nearly outmaneuvered Hitler, only to be trounced by Schleicher, Papen turned his attentions on defeating Schleicher, and concluded an agreement with Hitler. Seizure of control (1931‚Äì1933) On 10 March 1931, with street violence between the Rotfront and SA increasing, breaking all previous barriers and expectations, Prussia re-enacted its ban on Brownshirts. Days after the ban, SA-men shot dead two communists in a street fight, which led to a ban being placed on the public speaking of Goebbels, who sidestepped the prohibition by recording speeches and playing them to an audience in his absence. When Hitler's citizenship became a matter of public discussion in 1924 he had a public declaration printed on 16 October 1924, Under the threat of criminal deportation home to Austria, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925, and did not acquire German citizenship until almost seven years later; therefore, he was unable to run for public office. Hitler gained German citizenship after being appointed a Free State of Brunswick government official by Dietrich Klagges, after an earlier attempt by Wilhelm Frick to convey citizenship as a Thuringian police official failed.\\"Frick's Participation in Promoting the Nazi Conspirator's Accession to Power\\" The Avalon Project Ernst R√∂hm, in charge of the SA, put Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorff, a vehement anti-Semite, in charge of the Berlin SA. The deaths mounted, with many more on the Rotfront side, and by the end of 1931 the SA had suffered 47 deaths and the Rotfront recorded losses of approximately 80 killed. Street fights and beer hall battles resulting in deaths occurred throughout February and April 1932, all against the backdrop of Adolf Hitler's competition in the presidential election which pitted him against the monumentally popular Hindenburg. In the first round on 13 March, Hitler had polled over 11 million votes but was still behind Hindenburg. The second and final round took place on 10 April: Hitler (36.8% 13,418,547) lost to Paul von Hindenburg (53.0% 19,359,983) while the KPD candidate Th√§lmann gained a meagre percentage of the vote (10.2% 3,706,759). At this time, the Nazi Party had just over 800,000 members. Three days after the presidential elections, the German government banned the Nazi Party paramilitaries, the SA and the SS, on the basis of the Emergency Decree for the Preservation of State Authority. This action was largely prompted by details that emerged at a trial of SA men for assaulting unarmed Jews in Berlin. After less than a month the law was repealed on 30 May by Franz von Papen, Chancellor of Germany. Such ambivalence about the fate of Jews was supported by the culture of anti-Semitism that pervaded the German public at the time. In the federal election of July 1932, the Nazis won 37.3% of the popular vote (13,745,000 votes), an upswing by 19 percent, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag, with 230 out of 608 seats. Dwarfed by Hitler's electoral gains, the KPD turned away from legal means and increasingly towards violence. One resulting battle in Silesia resulted in the army being dispatched, each shot sending Germany further into a potential civil war. By this time both sides marched into each other's strongholds hoping to spark a rivalry. The attacks continued and reached fever pitch when SA leader Axel Schaffeld was assassinated on 1 August. As the Nazi Party was now the largest party in the Reichstag, it was entitled to select the President of the Reichstag and were able to elect G√∂ring for the post. Energised by the success, Hitler asked to be made chancellor. Hitler was offered the job of vice-chancellor by Chancellor Papen at the behest of President Hindenburg but he refused. Hitler saw this offer as placing him in a position of \\"playing second fiddle\\" in the government. In his position of Reichstag president, G√∂ring asked that decisive measures be taken by the government over the spate in murders of Nazi Party members. On 9 August, amendments were made to the Reichstrafgesetzbuch statute on \\"acts of political violence\\", increasing the penalty to \\"lifetime imprisonment, 20 years hard labour[,] or death\\". Special courts were announced to try such offences. When in power less than half a year later, Hitler would use this legislation against his opponents with devastating effect. The law was applied almost immediately but did not bring the perpetrators behind the recent massacres to trial as expected. Instead, five SA men who were alleged to have murdered a KPD member in Potempa (Upper Silesia) were tried. Hitler appeared at the trial as a defence witness, but on 22 August the five were convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, this sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in early September. They served just over four months before Hitler freed all imprisoned Nazis in a 1933 amnesty. The Nazi Party lost 35 seats in the November 1932 election, but remained the Reichstag's largest party, with 196 seats (33.1%). The Social Democrats (SPD) won 121 seats (20.4%) and the Communists (KPD) won 100 (16.9%). The Communist International described all moderate left-wing parties as \\"social fascists\\" and urged the Communists to devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. As a result, the KPD, following orders from Moscow, rejected overtures from the Social Democrats to form a political alliance against the NSDAP. After Chancellor Papen left office, he secretly told Hitler that he still held considerable sway with President Hindenburg and that he would make Hitler chancellor as long as he, Papen, could be the vice chancellor. Another notable event was the publication of the Industrielleneingabe, a letter signed by 22 important representatives of industry, finance and agriculture, asking Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after the parliamentary elections of July and November 1932 had not resulted in the formation of a majority government‚Äîdespite the fact that Hitler had been Hindenburg‚Äôs opponent in the presidential election only 9 months earlier. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People's Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G√∂ring, Minister Without Portfolio (and Minister of the Interior for Prussia). The SA and SS led torchlit parades throughout Berlin. It is this event that would become termed Hitler's Machtergreifung (\\"seizure of power\\"). The term was originally used by some Nazis to suggest a revolutionary process, though Hitler, and others, used the word ' (\\"take-over of power\\"), reflecting that the transfer of power took place within the existing constitutional framework and suggesting that the process was legal. Papen was to serve as Vice-Chancellor in a majority conservative Cabinet ‚Äì still falsely believing that he could \\"tame\\" Hitler. Initially, Papen did speak out against some Nazi excesses. However, after narrowly escaping death in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, he no longer dared criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador. Both within Germany and abroad, there were initially few fears that Hitler could use his position to establish his later dictatorial single-party regime. Rather, the conservatives that helped to make him chancellor were convinced that they could control Hitler and \\"tame\\" the Nazi Party while setting the relevant impulses in the government themselves; foreign ambassadors played down worries by emphasizing that Hitler was \\"mediocre\\" if not a bad copy of Mussolini; even SPD politician Kurt Schumacher trivialized Hitler as a \\"Dekorationsst√ºck\\" (\\"piece of scenery/decoration\\") of the new government. German newspapers wrote that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was \\"a barrier, over which violence cannot proceed\\" and because of the German nation being proud of \\"the freedom of speech and thought\\". Theodor Wolff of Frankfurter Zeitung wrote: Even within the Jewish German community, in spite of Hitler not hiding his ardent antisemitism, the worries appear to have been limited. In a declaration of 30 January, the steering committee of the central Jewish German organization (Centralverein deutscher Staatsb√ºrger j√ºdischen Glaubens) wrote that \\"as a matter of course\\" the Jewish community faces the new government \\"with the largest mistrust\\", but at the same they were convinced that \\"nobody would dare to touch [their] constitutional rights\\". The Jewish German newspaper J√ºdische Rundschau wrote on 31 Jan: However, a growing number of keen observers, like Sir Horace Rumbold, British Ambassador in Berlin, began to revise their opinions. On 22 February 1933, he wrote, \\"Hitler may be no statesman but he is an uncommonly clever and audacious demagogue and fully alive to every popular instinct,\\" and he informed the Foreign Office that he had no doubt that the Nazis had \\"come to stay.\\"Kershaw, Ian, Making Friends with Hitler: Lord Londonderry and Britain's Road to War, Penguin, 2012, , 512 p. On receiving the dispatch Robert Vansittart, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, concluded that if Hitler eventually gained the upper hand, \\"then another European war [was] within measurable distance.\\"Liebmann, George, Diplomacy Between the Wars: Five Diplomats and the Shaping of the Modern World, I.B. Tauris, 2008, , 288 p., p. 74. With Germans who opposed Nazism failing to unite against it, Hitler soon moved to consolidate absolute power. Chancellor to dictator Enabling Act, Hitler offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States or the Churches if granted the emergency powers. Following the Reichstag fire, the Nazis began to suspend civil liberties and eliminate political opposition. The Communists were excluded from the Reichstag. At the March 1933 elections, again no single party secured a majority. Hitler required the vote of the Centre Party and Conservatives in the Reichstag to obtain the powers he desired. He called on Reichstag members to vote for the Enabling Act on 24 March 1933. Hitler was granted plenary powers \\"temporarily\\" by the passage of the Act. The law gave him the freedom to act without parliamentary consent and even without constitutional limitations. Employing his characteristic mix of negotiation and intimidation, Hitler offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States or the Churches if granted the emergency powers. With Nazi paramilitary encircling the building, he said: \\"It is for you, gentlemen of the Reichstag to decide between war and peace\\". The Centre Party, having obtained promises of non- interference in religion, joined with conservatives in voting for the Act (only the Social Democrats voted against). The Act allowed Hitler and his Cabinet to rule by emergency decree for four years, though Hindenburg remained President. Hitler immediately set about abolishing the powers of the states and the existence of non-Nazi political parties and organisations. Non-Nazi parties were formally outlawed on 14 July 1933, and the Reichstag abdicated its democratic responsibilities. Hindenburg remained commander-in-chief of the military and retained the power to negotiate foreign treaties. The Act did not infringe upon the powers of the President, and Hitler would not fully achieve full dictatorial power until after the death of Hindenburg in August 1934. Journalists and diplomats wondered whether Hitler could appoint himself President, who might succeed him as Chancellor, and what the army would do. They did not know that the army supported Hitler after the Night of the Long Knives, or expect that he would combine the two positions of President and Chancellor into one office. Only Hitler, as head of state, could dismiss Hitler as head of the government. All soldiers took the Hitler Oath on the day of Hindenburg's death, swearing \\"unconditional obedience\\" to Hitler personally, not to the office or nation. A large majority approved of combining the two positions in the 1934 German referendum.

Gardens by the Bay was part of the nation's plans to transform its \\"Garden City\\" to a \\"City in a Garden\\", with the aim of raising the quality of life by enhancing greenery and flora in the city. First announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at Singapore's National Day Rally in 2005, Gardens by the Bay was intended to be Singapore's premier urban outdoor recreation space, and a national icon. Being one of the popular tourist attractions in Singapore, the park received 6.4 million visitors in 2014, while topping its 20 millionth visitor mark in November 2015 and over 50 million in 2018. Bay Central Garden Bay Central Garden will act as a link between Bay South and Bay East Gardens. It stands at with a waterfront promenade that allows for scenic walks stretching from the city centre to the east of Singapore. Bay East Garden The Singapore skyline viewed from Bay East Garden Bay East Garden is in size and it has a promenade frontage bordering the Marina Reservoir. An interim park was developed at Bay East Garden in support of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. The first phase of the garden was opened to the public in October 2011, allowing alternative access to the Marina Barrage. It is designed as a series of large tropical leaf-shaped gardens, each with its own specific landscaping design, character and theme. There will be five water inlets aligned with the prevailing wind direction, maximizing and extending the shoreline while allowing wind and water to penetrate the site to help cool areas of activity around them. Bay East Garden provides visitors with an unobstructed view of the city skyline. Upcoming developments of Bay East Garden will be based on the theme of water. In 2018, Bay East Garden was designated as the future site of the Founders' Memorial. Bay South Garden Bay South Garden opened to the public on 29 June 2012. It is the largest of the three gardens at and designed to show the best of tropical horticulture and garden artistry. The overall concept of its master plan by Grant Associates draws inspiration from an orchid as it is representative of the tropics and of Singapore, being the country's national flower, the Vanda 'Miss Joaquim'. The orchid takes root at the waterfront (conservatories), while the leaves (landforms), shoots (paths, roads and linkways) and secondary roots (water, energy and communication lines) then form an integrated network with blooms (theme gardens and Supertrees) at key intersections. Conservatories Gardens by the Bay in 2012 The conservatory complex at Gardens by the Bay, Singapore, comprises two cooled conservatories ‚Äì the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, situated along the edge of Marina Reservoir. The conservatories, designed by WilkinsonEyre and Grant Associates, are intended to be an energy-efficient showcase of sustainable building technologies and to provide an all-weather edutainment space within the Gardens. Both are very large (around ) and the Flower Dome is the world's largest columnless glasshouse. The construction of the glasshouses is special in two ways. First of all by being able to have such large a glass-roof without additional interior support (such as columns). Secondly, because the constructions aim strongly at minimizing the environmental footprint. Rainwater is collected from the surface and circulated in the cooling system which is connected to the Supertrees. The Supertrees are used both to vent hot air and to cool circulated water. =Flower Dome= The Flower Dome is the largest greenhouse in the world as listed in the 2015 Guinness Book of World Records at 1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) and replicates a cool-dry mediterranean climate. It features a changing display, the flower field, and eight other gardens, namely The Baobabs, Succulent Garden, Australian Garden, South African Garden, South American Garden, Olive Grove, California Garden and the Mediterranean Garden. These eight gardens exhibit exotic flowers and plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid regions from five different continents. Here is the list of some plants growing in the Flower Dome: =Cloud Forest= The Cloud Mountain The Lost World The Cloud Forest is higher but slightly smaller at . It replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions between and above sea level, found in South-East Asia, Central- and South America. It features a \\"Cloud Mountain\\", accessible by an elevator, and visitors will be able to descend the mountain via a circular path where a waterfall provides visitors with refreshing cool air. The \\"Cloud Mountain\\" itself is an intricate structure completely clad in epiphytes such as orchids, ferns, peacock ferns, spike- and clubmosses, bromeliads and anthuriums. The design by Grant Associates was inspired by the Maiden Hair Fungus and consists of a number of levels, each with a different theme, including The Lost World, The Cavern, The Waterfall View, The Crystal Mountain, The Cloud Forest Gallery, The Cloud Forest Theatre and The Secret Garden. The following is a partial list of plants growing in the Cloud Forest: Supertree Grove Supertrees are the 18 tree-like structures that dominate the Gardens' landscape with heights that range between and . They were conceived and designed by Grant Associates, with the imaginative engineering of Atelier One and Atelier Ten. They are vertical gardens that perform a multitude of functions, which include planting, shading and working as environmental engines for the gardens. Supertree Grove, Singapore A night view of the Supertrees The Supertrees are home to enclaves of unique and exotic ferns, vines, orchids and also a vast collection of bromeliads such as Tillandsia, amongst other plants. They are fitted with environmental technologies that mimic the ecological function of trees: photovoltaic cells that harness solar energy which can be used for some of the functions of the Supertrees (such as lighting), similar to how trees photosynthesize, and collection of rainwater for use in irrigation and fountain displays, similar to how trees absorb rainwater for growth. The Supertrees also serve air intake and exhaust functions as part of the conservatories' cooling systems. There is an elevated walkway, the OCBC Skyway, between two of the larger Supertrees for visitors to enjoy a panoramic aerial view of the Gardens. Every night, at 7:45pm and 8:45pm, the Supertree Grove comes alive with a coordinated light and music show known as the Garden Rhapsody. The accompanying music to the show changes every month or so, with certain themes such as A World of Wonder and A Night of Musical Theatre, which features excerpts/pieces from films like Jurassic Park and Pirates of the Caribbean. There is also a newly opened attraction called the Supertree Observatory, which opened on 27 December 2019. This attraction is housed inside the tallest Supertree which is 50 metres tall. It comprises 3 levels, the ground floor, the Observatory Space and the Open-Air Rooftop Deck. Visitors would take the lift up to the Observatory Space and thereafter take a flight of stairs up to the Rooftop Deck. The Observatory Space is located one level below the rooftop deck and it consists of an indoor area with full-height glass windows, as well as a peripheral outdoor walkway. Here, visitors can also experience a message about the effects of climate change creatively conveyed through digital media. The Open- Air Rooftop Deck, which is an open-air observation deck on the canopy of this Supertree, offers 360-degree unblocked views of the Gardens and the Marina Bay area. Italy's Pavilion in Expo 2015, featured a structure called Albero Della Vita (or \\"Tree of Life\\" in Italian), which proved visually similar to Singapore's Supertrees. Children's Garden Designed by Grant Associates, which also designed Gardens by the Bay, the Children's Garden was fully funded by Far East Organization for $10 million. This attraction was opened on 21 January 2014. The children's garden is near the treehouse and the adventure trail. The adventure trail consists of trampolines, balancing beams, hanging bridges and more. It is open from Tuesdays to Fridays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. It is closed on Mondays, or on the next working day if Monday is a public holiday. Horticultural themed gardens There are two distinctly different sets of horticultural themed gardens which centre on the horticultural heritage of the various cultural groups in Singapore and on the biology and ecology of gardens and forests. They are an important part of the Gardens' edutainment programme, which aims to bring plant knowledge to the public. The \\"Heritage Gardens\\" theme features gardens that highlight the various cultural groups in Singapore and the important role that plants play in their respective cultures, as well as the country's colonial history. It also focuses on economically important plants in Singapore and South East Asia. The four gardens are the Indian Garden, the Chinese Garden, the Malay Garden and the Colonial Garden. The \\"World of Plants\\" theme emphasizes the web of relationships amongst the various plants within a fragile forest setting, showcasing the biodiversity of plant life on the planet. It consists of six subthemes illustrated by six \\"gardens\\", which are named Discovery, Web of Life, Fruits and Flowers, Understorey, World of Palms, and Secret Life of Trees. Bayfront Plaza and Floral Fantasy A model by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of the future garden at Marina South The Bayfront Plaza is the main entry precinct into the Gardens from Bayfront MRT station. It includes an attraction called Floral Fantasy which consists of four garden landscapes of floral artistry and a 4D ride experience. The 1,500 sqm Floral Fantasy features floral artistry, as well as a 4D multimedia ride simulating the journey of a dragonfly's flight path through Gardens by the Bay. Included is also an indoor events space, the Bayfront Pavilion, a cafe and a food and beverage fair on weekends. Budget The final construction cost for the project, not including the price of the land but including an access road, drainage works, and soil improvement, was within a $1.035 billion allocated budget. The annual operating cost was expected to be approximately $58 million, of which $28 million was for operation of the Conservatory buildings. The project received 1.7 million visitors between June and October 2012, who had free admission to most portions of the park but were required to purchase tickets for entering the Conservatories. In 2006, an international competition for the design of the park was held, attracting more than 70 entries submitted by 170 firms from 24 countries. Two British firms ‚Äì Grant Associates and Gustafson Porter ‚Äì were awarded the contracts for the Bay South and Bay East Gardens respectively. Alongside the lead designers Grant Associates, the design team for Bay South included WilkinsonEyre, Atelier Ten (environmental design consultants) and Atelier One (structural engineers). They were supported by a number of Singapore firms including CPG Consultants (architecture, civil and structural, mechanical and electrical), Meinhardt Infrastructure (civil and structural), Langdon & Seah (cost consultants) and PMLink (project management). Transport connections The nearest Mass Rapid Transit station is Bayfront MRT station. The Gardens by the Bay MRT station, under construction, will open in 2021. Bus Service 400 also serves the Gardens.

The Sea of Faith Network (SoF) is an organisation with the stated aim to explore and promote religious faith as a human creation. History The SoF movement started in 1984 as a response to Don Cupitt's book and television series, both titled Sea of Faith. Cupitt was educated in both science and theology at the University of Cambridge in the 1950s, and is a philosopher, theologian, Anglican priest, and former Dean of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In the book and TV series, he surveyed western thinking about religion and charted a transition from traditional realist religion to the view that religion is simply a human creation. The name Sea of Faith is taken from Matthew Arnold's nostalgic mid 19th century poem \\"Dover Beach\\", in which the poet expresses regret that belief in a supernatural world is slowly slipping away; the \\"sea of faith\\" is withdrawing like the ebbing tide. Following the television series, a small group of radical Christian clergy and laity began meeting to explore how they might promote this new understanding of religious faith. Starting with a mailing list of 143 sympathisers, they organised the first UK conference in 1988. A second conference was held in the following year shortly after which the SoF Network was officially launched. Annual national conferences have been a key event of the network ever since. Organization The Sea Of Faith Network holds national and regional conferences and promotional events each year. There is an active network of local groups who meet regularly for discussion and exploration.Sea of Faith Network retrieved 21 May 2013 The group's magazine Sofia is published bi- monthly in the United Kingdom. It has a circulation beyond the SoF membership. The group also maintains a web site and an on-line discussion group. Currently there are national networks in the UK, New Zealand and Australia with scattered membership in the USA, Northern Ireland, South Africa, France and The Netherlands. The world-wide membership, as of 2004, stood at about 2,000. Each national network is run by a steering committee elected from its members. Beliefs SoF has no official creed or statement of belief to which members are required to assent, seeing itself as a loose network rather than a formal religious movement or organisation. Its stated aim is to \\"explore and promote religious faith as a human creation\\". In this it spans a broad spectrum of faith positions from uncompromising non-realism at one end to critical realism at the other. Some members describe themselves as on the liberal or radical wing of conventional belief (see liberal Christianity) while others choose to call themselves religious or Christian humanists (see humanism). Some even refer to themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply nontheist (see Christian atheism). SoF possesses no religious writings or ceremonies of its own; many members remain active in their own religion (mainly but not exclusively Christian) while others have no religious affiliation at all. Philosophy A number of commentators have identified SoF as closely associated with the non- realist approach to religion. This refers to the belief that God has no \\"real\\", objective, or empirical existence, independent of human language and culture; God is \\"real\\" in the sense that he is a potent symbol, metaphor or projection, but he has no objective existence outside and beyond the practice of religion. Non-realism therefore entails a rejection of all supernaturalism, including concepts such as miracles, the afterlife, and the agency of spirits. Cupitt wrote, \\"God is the sum of our values, representing to us their ideal unity, their claims upon us and their creative power\\".Taking Leave of God, Don Cupitt, SCM, 1980, 2001 edition: Cupitt calls this \\"a voluntarist interpretation of faith: a fully demythologized version of Christianity\\". It entails the claim that even after we have given up the idea that religious beliefs can be grounded in anything beyond the human realm, religion can still be believed and practised in new ways. Founder's influence Since he began writing in 1971, Cupitt has produced 36 books. During this time his views have continued to evolve and change. In his early books such as Taking Leave of God and The Sea of Faith Cupitt talks of God alone as non-real, but by the end of the 1980s he moved into postmodernism, describing his position as empty radical humanism: that is, there is nothing but our language, our world, and the meanings, truths and interpretations that we have generated. Everything is non-real, including God. While Cupitt was the founding influence of SoF and is much respected for his work for the network, it would not be true to say that he is regarded as a guru or leader of SoF. Members are free to dissent from his views and Cupitt himself has argued strongly that SoF should never be a fan club. Both Cupitt and the network emphasise the importance of autonomous critical thought and reject authoritarianism in all forms.

He was a competent officer and well respected by his troops and fellow officers to whom he was known as \\"Fighting Joe\\". Major General William Tecumseh Sherman said of Mower, \\"he's the boldest young officer we have\\". Biography Mower was born in Woodstock, Vermont. He volunteered as a private in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1855 he entered the U.S. army as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Infantry.The Civil War: A Narrative, Red River to Appomattox, Page 834. Shelby Foote As part of the 1st US Infantry, Mower saw action in the Battle of Wilson's Creek in August 1861. Still with the regiment during the Battle of Island No. 10, Major-General John Pope selected Mower to construct a siege battery in front of New Madrid, leading to the capture of that river port early in the campaign. He later became colonel of the 11th Missouri Infantry Regiment and fought at the Siege of Corinth. He assumed command of the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division in the Army of the Mississippi and led it into action at the Battle of Corinth. He was wounded in the neck and taken prisoner by Confederate forces but he was recovered by Union soldiers the same day. He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on November 29, 1862. He recovered from his wounds and returned to command a brigade during the Vicksburg Campaign and siege of Vicksburg where he caught the attention of William T. Sherman. During the Red River Campaign he commanded the 1st and 3rd Divisions of the XVI Army Corps and won brevets in the regular army for actions at the battles of Fort De Russy and Yellow Bayou. He commanded the 1st Division of the Right Wing, XVI Corps at the Battle of Tupelo. He was promoted to major general on August 12, 1864, and General Sherman ordered Mower to join the Union forces in Atlanta. He commanded the 1st Division of the XVII Army Corps during the March to the Sea and the Carolinas Campaign. His division played a significant role in the battles of Salkehatchie and Bentonville. Sherman made him commander of XX Corps in the Army of Georgia late in the war. After the fighting had ceased he sailed for Texas along with General Gordon Granger. He was placed in command of the District of Eastern Texas. After the war he stayed in the army and became Colonel of the 39th U.S. Infantry and the 25th U.S. Infantry.

Throughout the last two centuries, there have been two institutions with the name Ohio Penitentiary or Ohio State Penitentiary; the first prison was in Columbus, Ohio. Inmates in Levels 5B and 5A are classified as those who fail to adapt or those who are active participants/ring leaders of security threat groups. Level 4 inmates occupy similarly-designed cells but have additional freedom to move about within specific cell blocks. Inmates classified as Level 4B may also exercise within their specific cell block, but are also required to lock down before security staff enter the cell block to perform range checks, serve food, etc. Inmates classified as Level 4A are not subject to this restriction. Formerly, the majority of Ohio's death row inmates were held at OSP. In January 2012, the majority of death row inmates were transferred to the Chillicothe Correctional Institution. OSP does retain death row cells for inmates who are considered the highest security risk. As of 2019, six high security death row inmates remain at OSP, four of whom were involved in the 1993 Lucasville prison riot at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility.http://www.chillicothegazette.com/article/20120127/NEWS01/201270308/CCI- death-row-receives-final-inmates?odyssey=modnewswelltexts Ohio State Penitentiary currently holds level 5, 4, 3 and 1 inmates. Level 1 inmates are housed outside of the institutional fence in their own building. Inmates placed in restricted housing for disciplinary rules infractions are locked down with the exception of showers, restrooms, and one recreation period of one hour, 5 days per week.  Original prison  The original Ohio Penitentiary was located in Columbus, Ohio. It was demolished in 1998 to make way for the Arena District. During its time of operation, the penitentiary hosted many notable prisoners including James H. Snook and the novelist O. Henry. During the American Civil War, the prison housed members of John Hunt Morgan's Confederate cavalry, who had been detained following Morgan's Raid. Morgan and several of his men successfully escaped captivity and returned to the South.  2011 hunger strike  In January 2011, three men on Ohio's Death Row, Keith LaMar, Jason Robb and Carlos Sanders, held a twelve-day long hunger strike. The reason for the strike was that they were not receiving equal treatment and privileges as the other death row prisoners, which LaMar, Robb and Sanders believed was because they were placed on death row due to their involvement in the 1993 Lucasville prison riot at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility. The prisoners drew influence for their strike from the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, which lasted for 53 days. The prisoners' requests were that they wanted more time out of their cells, access to sunlight, access to more food and warm-weather clothing through commissary. They also requested semi-contact visits and access to news and legal databases in order to help their attorneys file appeals to their sentences, all privileges that were accessible to the other death row inmates. Throughout the strike the three men met with the Warden to negotiate a signed agreement to their demands, which they received on January 14, 2011. Robb ended his hunger strike the same day they received the agreement, however LaMar and Sanders did not end their strike until the following day, when they also received a letter of support for the strike containing 1,200 signatures from around the world.

It was published monthly and circulated across North America, Europe and hundreds of other locations worldwide for over fifteen years. Ever since its beginnings in 1992 in the basement of a church in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Global Rhythm has provided its readership with information on the arts traditions of the world's many cultures. Each issue contains music and film reviews and articles on foreign film, international travel and ethnic cuisine. A typical issue may feature articles on subjects as varied as Uganda's Jewish community, the reggae musician Burning Spear, Maya cuisine, Scandinavia's blossoming music scene and Bollywood's latest films. Each issue was accompanied by Global Rhythm on Disc, a full-length music compilation CD allowing subscribers to hear some of the music they were reading about. Recent musicians who have appeared on the sampler include Senegalese Afro-pop star Baaba Maal, Cuba's Buena Vista Social Club, India's Susheela Raman, Corsica's I Muvrini, Brazil's Gilberto Gil, Ireland's Chieftains and Cape Verde's Ces√°ria √âvora. Global Rhythm was formerly called Rhythm Music Monthly, (RMM) a Boston-area free- distribution journal published by Kyle Russell, a local music promoter, starting in 1992. The first issues were essentially compendia of upcoming concerts with feature interviews of local musicians and artists. Over the next two years a number of other individuals joined the effort, including Warren Senders, who edited the magazine until the end of 1993 (under the pseudonym Warne Russell), Raphael Brickman (graphic design), Vijaya Sundaram, Tomi Osuna, Leigh Maher, Jonathan Shulman, David Rumpler and many others. Alecia J. Cohen, who had been with Rhythm Music Monthly from the beginning purchased the newsletter style magazine from Kyle Russell, and then relaunched as Global Rhythm magazine, offer a wider array of coverage inclusive of film, cuisine and travel. Alecia Cohen took over as publisher in the mid-1990s, and remained in this position until late 2005, when the company was then acquired by Zenbu Media and Steve Bernstein was named Publisher, with Alecia Cohen continuing on as Associate Publisher of Global Rhythm and Zenbu Media. The Editor in Chief 2002 to 2006 was Jeff Tamarkin. Tad Hendrickson followed as Editor in Chief from mid-2006 to its closing at the end of 2008. Alecia Cohen left publishing in 2009 and moved full-time to Morocco launching a private travel agency that specializes in music, culture and arts tours. The magazine ceased publication in 2008.

Completely funded by Mathew Harder. It was also produced as the Model 269 family of light utility helicopters, some of which were marketed as the Model 300. The Model 300C was produced and further developed by Schweizer after 1983.  Development  In 1955, Hughes Tool Company's Aircraft Division carried out a market survey which showed that there was a demand for a low-cost, lightweight two-seat helicopter. The division began building the Model 269 in September 1955. It was initially designed with a fully glazed cockpit with seating for two pilots, or a pilot and passenger. It also had an open-framework fuselage and a three-blade articulated rotor. The prototype flew on 2 October 1956,\\"Military helicopters.\\" Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum. Retrieved: 17 June 2012. but it wasn't until 1960 that the decision was made to develop the helicopter for production. The original truss-work tailboom was replaced with a tubular tailboom and the cockpit was restructured and refined prior to being put into production. With this model, Hughes successfully captured a large portion of the civilian helicopter market with an aircraft that would prove itself popular in agriculture, police work and other duties.  Design  The Hughes 269 was designed with a fully articulated, three-blade main rotor designed by Drago Jovanovich, and a two-blade tail rotor that would remain as distinctive characteristics of all its variants. It also has shock absorber-damped, skid- type landing gear. The flight controls are directly linked to the swashplate of the helicopter so there are no hydraulic systems in the 269. There are generally two sets of controls, although this was optional on the civil 269A. For three-seat aircraft, the middle collective control stick is removable and a seat cushion can be put in its place for the third passenger.  Operational history  TH-55A Osage helicopter parked on the flightline. In 1958, prior to full-time production, Hughes provided five preproduction Model 269 examples to the U.S. Army for evaluation as a light observation helicopter to replace the aging OH-13 Sioux and OH-23 Raven. Designated as the YHO-2HUFrawley, 2002, p. 148.Gunston 1978, p. 205. the helicopter was eventually turned down. 9 April 1959, the 269 received certification from the FAA and Hughes continued to concentrate on civil production. With some design changes, deliveries of the Model 269A version began in 1961. By mid-1963 about 20 aircraft were being produced a month and by the spring of 1964, 314 had been built. While the U.S. Army had not found the Model 269 adequate for combat missions, in 1964 it adopted the Model 269A as its training helicopter to replace the TH-23 and designated it the TH-55A Osage. 792 TH-55 helicopters would be delivered by 1969, and it would remain in service as the U.S. Army's primary helicopter trainer until it was replaced in 1988 by the UH-1 Huey. At the time of its replacement, over 60,000 U.S. Army pilots had trained on TH-55 making it the U.S. Army's longest serving training helicopter. In addition to the U.S. Army, Hughes delivered TH-55/269/300s to other military customers. In 1964, Hughes introduced the slightly larger three-seat Model 269B which it marketed as the Hughes 300. That same year, the Hughes 269 set an endurance record of 101 hours. To set the record, two pilots took turns piloting the aircraft and hovered in ground-effect for fueling. To ensure no cheating, eggs were attached to the bottom of the skid gear to register any record-ending landing. Schweizer 300C The Hughes 300 was followed in 1969 by the improved Hughes 300C (sometimes 269C), which first flew on 6 March 1969 and received FAA certification in May 1970. This new model introduced a more powerful 190 hp (140 kW) Lycoming HIO-360-D1A engine and an increased-diameter rotor, giving a payload increase of 45%, plus overall performance improvements. It was this model that Schweizer began building under license from Hughes in 1983.Frawley 2003, p. 190. In 1986, Schweizer acquired all rights to the helicopter from McDonnell Douglas, who had purchased Hughes Helicopters in 1984, and renamed it McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems. For a few years after, Schweizer acquired the FAA Type Certificate known as the Schweizer-Hughes 300. While Schweizer made over 250 minor improvements, the basic design remained unchanged. Between Hughes and Schweizer, and including foreign-licensed production civil and military training aircraft, nearly 3,000 copies of the Model 269/300 have been built and flown over the last 50 years. That would have been the end of the story, but Schweizer continued to develop the model 300 by adding a turbine and redesigning the body to create the model 330m, and then further developed the dynamic components to take greater advantage of the power of the turbine engine; this led to the development of the Model 333.

He was a fast bowler of renowned pace and was notably successful on West Indies' non-Test playing tour of England in 1923, but he was probably past his peak by the time the West Indies were elevated to Test status. He was born in Trents, St. James, Barbados and died at Black Rock, Saint Michael, also in Barbados. The 1923 tour of England With limited opportunities in the inter-colonial cricket of the Caribbean and as a professional, Francis had played no first-class cricket when he was picked for 1923 West Indies tour of England. Francis' obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1943 states that he was a \\"groundsman\\" and that his selection for the tour came about through the \\"influence\\" of the captain, Harold Austin. The Trinidadian writer C. L. R. James, in Beyond a Boundary, wrote of how the non- selection of the Trinidad-born Herman Griffith, who played for Barbados, rankled and \\"an unknown, a bowler at the Austin nets, had been chosen instead\\". James continued: \\"To us it seemed that here was another flagrant piece of class discrimination. But the unknown bowler was soon to make himself known and never to be forgotten.\\" The \\"unknown\\" was Francis. The tour featured a mixture of first-class and other matches, and Francis' first appearance in a first-class game, the match against Sussex, was a sensation: he took four wickets for 50 in the Sussex first innings and then, when the county side was set just 99 to win the match, he took six for 33 to win the game for the West Indians by 26 runs. The Times said that Francis bowled \\"very fast\\". In his next match, Francis took five Hampshire first-innings wickets for 27, following up with two for 58 in the second innings. And in his third match, against Middlesex at Lord's, he returned figures of three for 86 and six for 34. The Times reported that \\"he was much too fast for most of the batsmen\\". Francis did not keep up this pace of wicket-taking, but he had another impressive match at the beginning of August against Surrey, when he followed five for 31 in the first innings with five for 45 in the second, and the West Indians won the match by 10 wickets; he also took three first-innings catches off the bowling of Snuffy Browne. In its report on this match, The Times provided a detailed description of Francis' bowling: > He bowls fast and obviously scorns to conserve his strength. He is in a > hurry to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at > a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into > the air‚Äîa leap which one feels should be accompanied by a yell. At the end > of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes > it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With > it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make > nothing of him. Unusually, Francis also contributed significantly with the bat to this victory, making 41 out of a last-wicket partnership of 136 with the opening batsman, George Challenor, whose unbeaten 155 was more than half the West Indians' total of 306. Francis continued to take wickets through August, although he was \\"indisposed\\" for one match. The tour finished on a high note for him: during the last match at the Scarborough Festival against H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI, with the Leveson-Gower side requiring only 28 to win on the third morning, Francis and George John bowled for an hour and 20 minutes and took six wickets between for 19 runs before a seventh wicket partnership hit the runs off. The Times reported that \\"the bowling of Mr Francis and Mr John may be compared to that of those famous Australian bowlers, Mr Gregory and Mr Macdonald [sic], during their last tour in this country\\". The review of the 1923 tour in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's 1924 edition singled Francis out for praise as \\"an excellent fast bowler of quite an old-fashioned type\\". It went on: \\"Scorning the 'off theory' he bowled at the wicket, and in match after match he was justified by results...Though not abnormal in speed he always maintained a fine pace.\\" Back in the West Indies Francis played a little first-class cricket in the Inter-Colonial Tournament, but his main senior cricket between the 1923 and 1928 tours of England came in a series of five games against the 1925‚Äì26 MCC side, which played Barbados twice and a West Indies representative side three times. The first Barbados game was a dramatic success for Francis and his fast-bowling partner Herman Griffith; they each took nine wickets as the MCC side was beaten by an innings, and Francis' second-innings six for 21 was at that stage the best innings analysis of his career. The match with West Indies that followed immediately afterwards, however, proved almost the opposite, and Francis took only one wicket as Wally Hammond hit a double-century and the West Indian side collapsed twice, to be rescued from a heavy defeat by rain. A second match between MCC and Barbados followed this and fortunes were again reversed, with MCC this time salvaging a late draw after being outplayed: Francis in this match took seven MCC first-innings wickets for 50 runs and these were the best innings figures of his whole career. Francis appeared in the other two representative matches for the West Indies, one in Trinidad and the other in British Guiana, with mixed success. In the three-match series, he took eight wickets at a high average of 37.25; in other first-class matches that season, including the two Barbados v MCC games, he took 18 wickets at an average of 8.11. The 1928 tour of England The 1926 Imperial Cricket Conference decided that representative matches between the established Test nations ‚Äì England, Australia and South Africa ‚Äì and three new sides from India, the West Indies and New Zealand would henceforward be considered as Test matches, and the 1928 West Indies team was the first to make this transition. Francis, along with his Barbadian partner Griffith and Learie Constantine, who had toured England in 1923, were the three fast bowlers in the side, but the tour as a whole was a disappointment: \\"So far from improving upon the form of their predecessors, the team of 1928 fell so much below it that everybody was compelled to realise that the playing of Test Matches between England and West Indies was a mistake,\\" wrote Wisden. Francis \\"although still fast, had not quite the pace or accuracy he possessed in 1923\\". With the side heavily reliant on their fast bowlers, the slip fielders and wicketkeepers \\"blundered time and again\\". Griffith alone of the three fast bowlers made an impact in the three Test matches, taking 11 wickets; Constantine, a failure with both bat and ball in the Tests, compensated with 1381 runs and 107 wickets in all first-class matches; Francis shone neither in the Tests nor in the other games. His six Test wickets cost 42 runs each and he conceded three-and-a-half runs an over; in first-class games he took just 56 wickets at an average of 31.96. He bowled West Indies' first ball in Test cricket in the game at Lord's, and in the match at The Oval he took four wickets for 112 runs, but England needed to bat only once in each of the three Tests, and the lowest total scored off the West Indies' bowling was the 351 of the second match. In the games against the first-class counties, Francis did not take five wickets in any single innings. In a first-class festival cricket match at the end of the season against the Harlequins, an amateur team composed of former Oxford and Cambridge University players, Francis enjoyed his best-ever match with the bat: in the first innings, he made 61 and put on 107 for the last wicket in 50 minutes with Joe Small; in the second innings, he added 73 with Griffith for the last wicket and was 32 not out when the innings ended. The 61 was Francis' highest score in first-class cricket and his only score of more than 50. Tests in the West Indies and Australia Francis in Australia during the 1930‚Äì31 tour The next stages in the elevation of West Indies to Test status were that a team was sent to the Caribbean in 1929‚Äì30 by Marylebone Cricket Club to play a series of four Test matches and, the following season, a West Indian side travelled to Australia for the first Test series between those sides: Francis featured in matches in both seasons. The England side of 1929‚Äì30 was composed partly of Test-class players ‚Äì a second tour of similar standing was organised by MCC to another of the new Test nations, New Zealand, at the same time, and some established Test players opted out of both of them. The West Indies' Test team for this series was selected match-by-match by the individual countries' cricket authorities, and Francis played in only one Test, the third match, played at Georgetown, British Guiana; this was the West Indies' first Test victory, and though the batting, led by George Headley with a century in each innings and by Clifford Roach with a double-century in the first innings, took credit in the Wisden report, Francis took six wickets in the match and, with Constantine taking nine, ensured the England side was bowled out twice. Francis' first-innings figures of four for 40 were the best innings figures he achieved in Test cricket. The following winter, Francis, with Griffith and Constantine, formed a three-man fast bowling attack in the first-ever series between the West Indies and Australia, although, as in England in 1928, the team's success was limited. In three of the first four Test matches, the West Indies side was beaten by an innings, but in the fifth and final Test, all three fast bowlers contributed to a narrow victory; Francis took four wickets for 48 runs in Australia's first innings. In the series as a whole, he took 11 wickets at an average of 31.81. Final matches The West Indies visited England again in 1933 and two trial matches were held in the Caribbean early in the year to select the side. Francis played in the second of these and took five wickets for 38 runs in the first innings and one for 17 in the second. These figures were not enough, however, to earn him selection and he joined Radcliffe in the Bolton Cricket League as a professional for both the 1933 and 1934 seasons, following on from one of the pioneers of black cricket in England, Charles Llewellyn. The tour organisers hoped that Constantine, who was playing Lancashire League cricket with Nelson, would be released from his contract for big matches; when Constantine was not released for the first Test match at Lord's, Francis was drafted in from Radcliffe to open the bowling with Manny Martindale. Francis failed to take a wicket in the match and, according to Wisden, \\"had lost something of his pace and nip off the pitch\\". He was not called on again, and the Test match proved to be his last game in first-class cricket.

Although they were produced by Kongsberg it was always called a \\"Mauser\\" in Norway, hence its listing under Mauser. Mauser rifles in Norway After WW2, large numbers of German Mauser 98k were confiscated by Norwegian forces. Most of the rifles were re- barrelled to .30-06 and used as normal service rifles, but a number of Mauser 98 actions were used as the basis for building both military sniper and civilian target rifles at Kongsberg V√•penfabrikk. Target shooting is very popular in Norway, and stocks of the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen M1894 were scarce after the end of the war. The Mauser rifles were available and very well suited to conversion into target rifles for use by the Norwegian DFS. The M59, M67 and the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen were the official target rifles of the Norwegian DFS until the adoption of the Sauer 200 STR in the 90's.

The M59F1 served first as a sniper rifle for the regular armed forces. After the NM149 was introduced, the M59F1 served with the Norwegian Home Guard (Heimevernet) until the 1990s. It was also used as a civilian target rifle, having the advantage over the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen M1894 that it did not suffer from changing point of impact in rainy weather. Thus, many shooters had a Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen for the sunny days and one Mauser for rainy days.

History The Church of Our Lady of Lourdes was blessed and officially opened in 1888. This is the first Tamil Catholic church in Singapore. The building site was obtained in 1885 and the cornerstone laid on 1 August 1886 by Bishop Gasnier, D.D. and Sir Frederick A. Weld, G. C M. G in an official ceremony that was witnessed by a number of religious and laity. It bears a resemblance to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, in France. Within the Church building itself is a grotto with life-sized statues depicting the appearance of Our Lady appearing to Saint Bernadette. Many architectural historians attribute this building to Swan & Maclaren, but it was more probably designed by a priest‚Äìarchitect, such as Father Nain, as many other Catholic buildings in Singapore were at the time. It could not have been executed by Swan & Maclaren, to whom it is often attributed, as the partnership was not formed until 1893, at which time the building was completed. More than likely the plans were submitted by A.W. Lermit of Swan & Lermit (predecessor of Swan & Maclaren). Today, the Church is used, up to a point, for the purpose for which it was built, i.e. as a worshipping place for Tamil Catholics. However, over the last decade, and in the interests of a multi-racial nation, it has welcomed Catholics of all races. Masses are held in English, Tamil and Sinhalese. The Church of Our Lady of Lourdes was gazetted as a national monument on 14 January 2005. As a national monument, it was given funding from the National Monuments Fund, administrated by the National Heritage Board, in 2016 for renovation works. Architecture The Church is a neo-Gothic building of good proportions and fine details and is said to have been modelled on its namesake building in the town of Lourdes in France. In 1982, the church was redecorated in reds, greys and yellows but was redecorated with a coating of white paint and the doors were highlighted with two shades of blue in another renovation in 1986. In 2009, the church building underwent restoration works to resemble the original church at a budget of S$1.75 million. It was completed in October 2010.

He is one of the most reclusive of British literary exiles, sharing his time between Austria, Italy, and the Philippines. Early life James Hamilton-Paterson was born on 6 November 1941 in London, England. His father was a neurosurgeon who treated the Aga Khan and provided the inspiration for the poem 'Disease', for which Hamilton-Paterson was awarded the Newdigate Prize. He was educated at Windlesham House, Sussex, Bickley Hall, Kent, King's School, Canterbury and Exeter College, Oxford. Having worked as a hospital orderly at St. Stephen's Hospital between 1966‚Äì1968, Paterson earned his first break in 1969 as a reporter for New Statesman until 1974 when he became features editor for Nova magazine. Literary career Hamilton-Paterson is generally known as a commentator on the Philippines, where he has lived on and off since 1979. His novel Ghosts of Manila (1994) portrayed the Philippine capital in all its decay and violence and was highly critical of the Marcoses - a view he rescinded with the publication of America's Boy (1998), which sets the Marcos regime into the geopolitical context of the time. In 1989, Gerontius was published, a reconstruction of a journey made by the composer Sir Edward Elgar along the River Amazon in 1923. Regarded by admirers as being among the best British novels of the 1980s, its poetic language, dreamlike landscapes and lush imaginings won him the Whitbread Award for first novel. In 1992, he published Seven-Tenths, a far-ranging meditation upon the sea and its meanings. A mixture of art, science, history and philosophy, this book is a deep, abstract lament on loss and the loss of meaning. In 2000, he returned to the magazine industry as a science columnist for Das Magazin (Zurich) for two years before becoming a science columnist for Die Weltwoche. More recently he won acclaim for his Gerald Samper trilogy as well as his non-fiction book Empire of the Clouds, which details the aviation industry in post-war Britain.

On 6 April 1992 it became the Educational and Training Services Branch (ETS) of the Adjutant General's Corps. History=1846-1914 On 2 July 1845 the Corps of Army Schoolmasters was formed, staffed by warrant officers and senior non- commissioned officers, as well as a few commissioned officers who served as inspectors and headmasters. In 1859 its duties were extended from simple schooling within the Army to assume responsibility for the Army schools and libraries and in 1903 the Army schoolmasters fell under the jurisdiction of the Adjutant-General. By the early 1900s, soldiers began to be admitted to evening classes, and some garrisons opened vocational classes. In 1914, a committee was set up for the \\"industrial training of soldiers\\", underlining the Army's intent to properly equip soldiers for civilian life. First World War Despite the strains of the First World War on the British Army, education of soldiers did not stop. The British Army was circulated in and out of the front line, reserve line, and rest areas. This allowed education to continue, albeit in a disrupted fashion. Even whilst in the trenches, boredom meant the soldiery desired news and information, and thus officers would organise lectures to satisfy these needs. The issue of resettlement was also raised by the war, and so a scheme was established to prepare men for civilian life. Under the Army Educational Scheme, soldiers who were educated by the Corps would receive a certificate of education. This certificate would then aid them in finding a job and competing with the thousands of other soldiers that would be demobilised and would also need a job once the war was over.Leeds, West Yorkshire Archive Service, Letters from Arthur Hague to Leeds Town Clerk Mitchell, 9 December 1918. 1920-1939 A Royal Warrant established the Army Educational Corps on 15 June 1920. The wartime task of its members was to \\"assist by all means in their power the maintenance of a high spirit of devotion and well being in their units\\". Peacetime duties were more clearly defined, and Army Educational Corps personnel were expected to do specialist and advisory work, with the bulk of the teaching to be done by regimental officers. By 1938, Army Educational Corps recruits were required to be between 20 and 25 years of age. They had to be either qualified teachers or university graduates. They initially enlisted for twelve years and were immediately promoted Sergeant.War Office, His Majesty's Army (1938). Second World War The Second World War saw the normal work of the corps radically change. The need for both physically and mentally competent troops resulted in an increased workload for the Army Education Centres. The AEC began to operate in a variety of different theatres and locations throughout the war, including the unexpected task of sending news-sheet teams with the D-Day landings. Recruits saw training time double, with education being conducted in hospitals, prisons and displaced persons camps. The end of the war saw the Corps involved in the daunting task of returning a national Army to civilian occupation. Unit Education Officers gave pre-release advice whilst the Corps organised an extensive network of \\"formation colleges\\". 1946-1992 On 28 November 1946 the AEC was honoured with the title of \\"Royal\\". In Britain this honour must be bestowed directly by the monarch, and allows the relevant service or organisation the right to use a representation of the crown in their badge. King George VI contributed to the design of the new badge. After the war the RAEC continued its work educating soldiers and helping them to resettle into civilian life. That same year, the responsibility of teaching the personnel's children was transferred to the newly formed British Families Education Service. From 1962 it was staffed exclusively by commissioned officers and the non-commissioned personnel were either commissioned or left the Army. In 1971, the education of soldiers was radically changed. Recruits joining the Army were generally poorly qualified and although the tasks of soldiering were easily mastered, the additional responsibilities involved in being an NCO proved more difficult. The new system introduced the Education Promotion Certificate. This was designed to specifically meet the training needs of potential Sergeants and Warrant Officers. In 1992 the RAEC lost its Corps status and became the Educational and Training Services Branch of the new Adjutant General's Corps. Headquarters The Army Educational Corps established its depot at Shorncliffe Army Camp in 1920. It then moved all its administration to Eltham Palace in 1948. On 15 May 1990, the Provisional IRA exploded a 10lb plastic explosive bomb in a flowerbed outside the Eltham Palace headquarters, injuring seven civilians. Following the formation of the Educational and Training Services Branch of the new Adjutant General's Corps, staff moved to Worthy Down Barracks in 1992.

In some fields of publishing, such as fiction writing, creator ownership has historically been standard. In other fields‚Äîsuch as comics, recorded music, or motion pictures‚Äîcreator ownership has traditionally been uncommon, with either work for hire or publisher purchase of the material being standard practice. This article traces the changing standards of the comic book industry.  Origins  Most successful American comics have been traditionally either sold to their publishers before publication, or produced as work for hire. Consequently, creator's rights have long been a source of conflict, going back to one of the pioneers of American comics, Richard F. Outcault: In 1906, Outcault took his creation Buster Brown from the New York Herald to the New York American. Outcault had not applied for a copyright to Buster Brown, but asserted a \\"common-law title\\"‚Äîwhat comics historian Don Markstein asserted is one of the earliest claims to creators' rights. The court decided the Herald owned the Buster Brown name and title and the copyright on the strips it published, but the characters themselves were too intangible to qualify for copyright or trademark. This freed Outcault to continue the strip in the American as long as he did not use the Buster Brown name.  Underground comix  Creator-owned titles began to appear during the late-1960s underground comix movement; these themes were exemplified in the formation of Rip Off Press, the United Cartoon Workers of America (UCWA), and Cartoonists Co-Op Press. Rip Off Press was founded in 1969 by four men‚Äîtwo of whom were cartoonists Gilbert Shelton and Jack Jackson‚Äîas a sort of cartoonists' cooperative, an alternative publishing venue to burgeoning Bay Area publishers like the Print Mint, Apex Novelties, and Company & Sons.Estren, Mark James (1993) [1974]. A History of Underground Comics (2 ed.). Ronin Publishing, p. 250. . The United Cartoon Workers of America was an informal union organized in 1970Goodrick, Susan. \\"Introduction,\\" The Apex Treasury of Underground Comics (Links Books/Quick Fox, 1974). by cartoonists Robert Crumb, Justin Green, Bill Griffith, Nancy Griffith, Art Spiegelman, Spain Rodriguez, Roger Brand, and Michele Brand.Young Lust #3 (Last Gasp, June 1972). Members of the UCWA agreed that all cartoonists would demand the same rate per page of comics, whether they were stars like Crumb or being published for the first time. They also agreed to not work for any publisher who had \\"cheated\\" other cartoonists. Dennis Kitchen's Kitchen Sink Press formed the \\"Local 2 ‚Äî Milwaukee\\" branch of the UCWA, and the UCWA brand appeared on a number of comix from that era. Cartoonists Co-Op Press was a 1973‚Äì1974 self-publishing venture by cartoonists Griffith, Spiegelman, Kim Deitch, Jerry Lane, Jay Lynch, Willy Murphy, and Diane Noomin. Like Rip Off Press, it was founded as an alternative to the existing underground publishers, which were perceived as not being honest with their accounting practices.Estren, Mark. A History of Underground Comics: 20th Anniversary Edition (Ronin Publishing, 2012), pp. 251-253.  Atlas/Seaboard  The short-lived genre publisher Atlas/Seaboard Comics, which operated from 1974‚Äì1975, offered some of the highest rates in the industry, plus return of artwork to artists and author rights to original character creations. These relatively luxurious conditions attracted such top names as Neal Adams, Steve Ditko, Russ Heath, John Severin, Alex Toth and Wally Wood, as well as such up-and-coming talents as Howard Chaykin and Rich Buckler.  Warren Publishing and original artwork  Up to the mid-1970s, most comic book publishers kept all original pages, in some cases destroying them in lieu of storing them safely. By 1974, James Warren's Warren Publishing began changing the industry's work-for-hire dynamic by offering higher page- rates than DC Comics or Marvel Comics, and allowing the artists to retain their original artwork,Cooke, Jon B. \\"Wrightson's Warren Days,\\" Comic Book Artist #4 (Spring 1999). giving creators the option to gain extra income by selling the pages to collectors. Nonetheless, Warren Publishing retained all creator's rights. As James Warren once told artist Bernie Wrightson: By 1975 or 1976, both DC and Marvel also began returning artist's original pages to them.  Neal Adams and the Comics Creators Guild  During the 1970s, artist Neal Adams was politically active in the industry, and attempted to unionize its creative community. Adams attempted to form the Comics Creators Guild, with a contentious meeting in May 1978 attended by Cary Bates, Howard Chaykin, Chris Claremont, Steve Ditko, Michael Golden, Archie Goodwin, Paul Levitz, Bob McLeod, Frank Miller, Carl Potts, Marshall Rogers, Jim Shooter, Walt Simonson, Jim Starlin, Len Wein, and Marv Wolfman.\\"The Comics Guild: A Professional Guild to Protect the Rights of Visual Creators: A Report,\\" The Comics Journal #42 (Oct. 1978), pp. 15-17.Groth, Gary. \\"Birth of the Guild: May 7, 1978,\\" The Comics Journal #42 (October 1978), pp. 21-28. Full list of Guild members: Terry Austin, Mike W. Barr, Cary Bates, Rick Bryant, Michael Catron, Howard Chaykin, Chris Claremont, Tony DeZuniga, Steve Ditko, Peter B. Gillis, Michael Golden, Archie Goodwin, Klaus Janson, Joe Jusko, Alan Kupperberg, Paul Levitz, Rick Marschall, Roger McKenzie, Bob McLeod, Frank Miller, Michael Netzer (Nasser), Martin Pasko, Carl Potts, Ralph Reese, Marshall Rogers, Josef Rubinstein, Jim Salicrup, James Sherman, Jim Shooter, Walt Simonson, Roger Slifer, Jim Starlin, Greg Theakston, Len Wein, Alan Weiss, Bob Wiacek, and Marv Wolfman. The effort failed to get off the ground. In addition, Adams, along with the Joker creator Jerry Robinson, notably and vocally helped lead the lobbying efforts that resulted in Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster receiving decades-overdue credit and some financial remuneration from Superman publisher DC Comics.  Marvel's mixed legacy  Marvel Comics had a mixed history of responding to the issue of creator's rights. In 1978, Marvel and Howard the Duck writer Steve Gerber clashed over issues of creative control, and Gerber was abruptly removed from the series. This was the first highly publicized creator's rights case in American comics, and attracted support from major industry figures. Gerber subsequently launched a lengthy legal battle for control of Howard the Duck, culminating in a 1981 lawsuit.\\"Gerber Sues Marvel over Rights to Duck,\\" The Comics Journal #62 (Mar. 1981), pp. 11-13. In contrast, in 1980 Marvel created the mature readers anthology Epic Illustrated, offering its writers and artists ownership rights and royalties in place of the industry-standard work for hire contracts.\\"Marvel Plans to Augment Creators' Benefits,\\" The Comics Journal #54 (Mar. 1980), p. 13. The success of Epic Illustrated led to the 1982 formation of the long-running imprint Epic Comics, which specialized in creator-owned titles. Around this same period, however, industry legend Jack Kirby, co- creator of many of Marvel's most popular characters, came into dispute with the company over the disappearance of original pages of artwork from some of his most famous and popular titles.\\"The Artist Waives Any Claim the Artist May Have,\\" The Comics Journal #105 (Feb. 1986), p. 2. (Kirby had quit working for Marvel in 1979, angry over what he perceived as the company's mistreatment of him.)\\"Ploog & Kirby Quit Marvel over Contract Dispute,\\" The Comics Journal #44 (Jan. 1979), p. 11. Best-selling creators like Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and many other stars became vocal advocates for Kirby. Neal Adams also petitioned to have his Marvel originals returned, and the pair won their battle in 1987, when Marvel returned original artwork to him and Kirby, among others.\\"Marvel Returns Art to Kirby, Adams,\\" The Comics Journal #116 (July 1987), p. 15.\\"Neal Adams Receives Art Without Signing Marvel's Short Form,\\" The Comics Journal #116 (July 1987), pp. 15-16. This decision helped lead to the modern industry's standard practice of returning original artwork to the artist, who can earn additional income from art sales to collectors.  Self-publishing  The late 1970s saw some creators take advantage of the then-new direct market distribution system for comics to self-publish their work. Dave Sim's Cerebus and Wendy and Richard Pini's ElfQuest were prominent examples of this approach. Self-publishers Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird created and self- published the wildly popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles beginning in 1984.  Rise of the independents  Beginning in the 1980s, several new publishers and imprints went into business, offering comics writers and artists the opportunity to have their work published while retaining the copyrights to the characters and the stories. Publishers like Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics were strong promoters of creator-owned superhero properties; their enticement of popular creators (such as Kirby)\\"Jack Kirby Returns to Comics with Cosmic Hero,\\" The Comics Journal #65 (Aug. 1981), p. 23. to their pages helped push the issue to the fore and put pressure on industry giants Marvel and DC. The alternative and independent publishers Fantagraphics and Dark Horse Comics entered the field during this period as well. Creator-owned properties allowed series to continue with multiple publishers as circumstances required; Usagi Yojimbo for instance has been published by four succeeding publishing houses. In the mid-to-late 1980s, creator ownership became a cause c√©l√®bre among many comics creators, including those working in the dominant genre of superheroes.

British comics and Alan Moore  Writer Alan Moore became increasingly concerned at the lack of creator's rights in British comics.Bishop, David. Thrill-Power Overload, p. 105-106 In 1985, he noted that he had stopped working for all British publishers except IPC, publishers of 2000 AD, \\"purely for the reason that IPC so far have avoided lying to me, cheating me or generally treating me like shit.\\" He joined other creators in decrying the wholesale relinquishing of all rights, and in 1986 stopped writing for 2000 AD as well.Bishop, Thrill-Power Overload, p. 110-111 Moore's outspoken opinions and principles, particularly on the subject of creator's rights and ownership, would see him burn bridges with a number of other publishers over the course of his career.Heidi MacDonald's interview with Moore, 1 November 2005. Originally at Mile High Comics/Comicon.com's The Beat; accessed through the Internet Archive: Part 1 and Part 2. Accessed 26 September 2008.  Creator's Bill of Rights  In November 1988 a number of independent comic book artists and writers drafted the Creator's Bill of Rights, a document designed to protect their rights as creators and aid against their exploitation by corporate work for hire practices. Issues covered by the Bill included giving creators proper credit for their characters and stories, profit-sharing, distribution, fair contracts, licensing, and return of original artwork. Through a series of meetings, a document was finalized at the \\"Northampton Summit,\\" held in Northampton, Massachusetts, and signed by all in attendance. Scott McCloud was the principal author of the Bill;\\"Creator's Rights\\". The Comics Journal #137 (September 1990), p. 65-71. other artists and writers participating in the Bill's creation included Dave Sim, Steve Bissette, Larry Marder, Rick Veitch, Peter Laird, and Kevin Eastman. In the end, however, many prominent comic book professionals, including some involved in its drafting, hold that the Creator's Bill of Rights itself had little or no impact on the industry.  Industry changes  In 1989, DC created the Piranha Press imprint, which featured creator-owned alternative titles. Piranha published a modest collection of original series and graphic novels until going defunct in 1994. In 1990, Creator's Bill of Rights signatory Kevin Eastman founded the creator- friendly Tundra Publishing to embody the ideals of the Bill from a publishers' standpoint. As part of the initial group who \\"got together to form the\\" Bill, Eastman felt obligated to expand it beyond theory and into practice, providing a creator-friendly forum for comics creators to work for a publisher while maintaining ownership of their work.Wiater, Stanley & Bissette, Stephen R. (ed.s) Comic Book Rebels: Conversations with the Creators of the New Comics (Donald I. Fine, Inc. 1993) . Tundra went bankrupt in 1993. In 1992 a number of popular Marvel artists formed their own company, Image Comics, which would serve as a prominent example of creator-owned comics publishing. Propelled by star power and upset that they did not own the popular characters they created for Marvel, several illustrators, including the X-Men‚Äôs Jim Lee, The New Mutants/X-Force‚Äôs Rob Liefeld, and Spider-Man‚Äôs Todd McFarlane formed Image, an umbrella label under which several autonomous, creator-owned companies existed.\\"Bye Bye Marvel; Here Comes Image: Portacio, Claremont, Liefeld, Jim Lee Join McFarlane's New Imprint at Malibu,\\" The Comics Journal #148 (February 1992), pp. 11-12. Image properties, such as WildC.A.T.s, Gen¬π¬≥, Witchblade and especially McFarlane‚Äôs Spawn provided brisk competition for long-standing superheroes. Many popular creators followed Image's lead and attempted to use their star power to launch their own series; ones for which they would have licensing rights and editorial control. Chris Claremont, famous for his long run as the writer of Uncanny X-Men, created Sovereign Seven for DC; Joe Madureira, also made popular by Uncanny X-Men, launched Battle Chasers for WildStorm Productions; and Kurt Busiek, Alex Ross, and Brent Anderson created Astro City for Image. DC's Vertigo imprint, launched in 1993, was the company's first successful attempt to routinely publish creator-owned series (right from its launch with Peter Milligan and Duncan Fegredo's Enigma). From the start, Vertigo founding editor Karen Berger was committed to creator-owned projects, working on several \\"[her]self with new writers and artists\\" as well as established names, with the express intention of \\"trying to bring new people into the industry, as well as use some of the best creators in comics.\\"\\"Interview with Karen Berger,\\" Advance Comics #49 (Capital City Distribution, January 1993). In addition to creator-owned series set in their own continuity, such as Enigma and Fallen Angel, DC published several creator- owned series, such as Sovereign Seven and Xero, that were set within the DC Universe. In 1994, Dark Horse Comics founded the Legend imprint in part to provide star creators like Frank Miller and John Byrne an avenue for creator- owned projects.  Pros and cons of creator ownership  In contrast, artist Marc Silvestri has asserted that a creator can make more money compared to working with company-owned characters, arguing \\"If money is in the equation, and everybody likes that, the money doesn't come from the number of the sales, it comes from the amount you get from those sales.\\" References Further reading  * Groth, Gary. \\"Editorial: Creator's Rights: The Latest Panacea,\\" The Comics Journal #87 (Dec. 1983), pp. 6‚Äì8. * The Comics Journal #121 (April 1985) ‚Äî special issue on creator's rights and DC Comics: ** Friedrich, Mike. \\"Ownerous Differences,\\" p. 21\\\\. ** Grant, Steven. \\"What Dick Said,\\" p. 24\\\\. ** Slifer, Roger. \\"Screwed by DC,\\" p. 25\\\\. ** McEnroe, Richard S. \\"Lies, Damned Lies, & Dick Giordano,\\" pp. 25‚Äì27. ** McEnroe, Richard S. \\"Copyrights & Consequences,\\" pp. 41‚Äì44. ** McEnroe, Richard S. \\"Packaging: Work-For-Hire in the Real Publishing Industry,\\" p. 44\\\\. * The Comics Journal #137 (Sept. 1990) ‚Äî special coverage of the Creator's Bill of Rights, including the full text of the Bill: ** \\"Creator's Rights,\\" pp. 65‚Äì71. ** \\"What Are Creators' Rights?,\\" pp. 66‚Äì71. ** Groth, Gary. \\"Steven Bissette and Scott McCloud,\\" pp. 72‚Äì92. ** Groth, Gary. \\"Creator vs. Corporate Ownership,\\" pp. 101‚Äì106: on \\"creators' rights,\\" Mark Askwith, Steve Bissette, Steve Saffel, and Bill Sienkiewicz. * \\"Alan Moore Refuses Marvel Permission to Reprint Dr. Who Work,\\" The Comics Journal #102 (Sept. 1985), p. 19\\\\. * \\"The Work-Made-For-Hire Contract, a Legal Definition,\\" The Comics Journal #104 (Jan. 1986), p. 11\\\\. * \\"Comics Contracts: What the Various Companies Offer,\\" The Comics Journal #113 (Dec. 1986), pp. 19‚Äì232. * \\"UK Creator Rights Panel Argues the Kirby-Marvel Dispute,\\" The Comics Journal #114 (Feb. 1987), pp. 23‚Äì24. * Plowright, Frank. \\"And As Ye Reap Shall Ye Sow,\\" The Comics Journal #122 (June 1988), p. 11: Editorial on British comics and creators' rights. * \\"What the Copyright Law Says,\\" The Comics Journal #130 (July 1989), p. 12\\\\. * \\"Creator's Rights in the Real World,\\" The Comics Journal #139 (Dec. 1990), pp. 110‚Äì114. * Berntsen, Christian and Relkin, Richard. \\"Cultural Corner,\\" Comic Culture vol. 1, # 3 (Jan./Feb. 1993), pp. 16‚Äì17: on creators' rights; includes text (draft) of \\"A Bill of Rights for Comic Creators.\\" * Rodi, Rob. \\"Blood & Thunder: Rights and Reason,\\" The Comics Journal #171 (Sept. 1994), pp. 2, 6. * Mescallado, Ray. \\"Fanboi Politik: Creator's Rights in the Mainstream,\\" The Comics Journal #215 (Aug. 1999), pp. 119‚Äì120.

Lenoir (12 January 1822 ‚Äì 4 August 1900) was a Belgian engineer who developed the internal combustion engine in 1858. Prior designs for such engines were patented as early as 1807 (De Rivaz engine), but none were commercially successful. Lenoir's engine was commercialized in sufficient quantities to be considered a success, a first for the internal combustion engine. He was born in Mussy-la-Ville (then in Luxembourg, part of the Belgian Province of Luxembourg since 1839). In 1838, he emigrated to France, taking up residence in Paris, where he developed an interest in electroplating. His interest in the subject led him to make several electrical inventions, including an improved electric telegraph. Lenoir engine Lenoir motor Lenoir gas engine 1860.jpg. By 1859, Lenoir's experimentation with electricity led him to develop the first internal combustion engine which burned a mixture of coal gas and air ignited by a \\"jumping sparks\\" ignition system by Ruhmkorff coil, and which he patented in 1860. The engine was a steam engine converted to burn gaseous fuel and thus pushed in both directions. The fuel mixture was not compressed before ignition (a system invented in 1801 by Philippe LeBon who developed the use of illuminating gas to light Paris), and the engine was quiet but inefficient, with a power stroke at each end of the cylinder. In 1863, the Hippomobile, with a hydrogen gas fueled, one cylinder, internal combustion engine, made a test drive from Paris to Joinville-le-Pont: top speed about 9 km in ~3 hours. Lenoir was an engineer at Petiene et Cie (Petiene & Company), who supported him in his founding of the companies of Corporation Lenoir-Gautier et Cie engines Paris and Soci√©t√© des Moteurs Lenoir in Paris in 1859, with a capitalization of two million francs and a factory in the Rue de la Roquette, to develop the engine, and a three-wheeled carriage constructed to use it. Although it ran reasonably well, the engine was fuel inefficient, extremely noisy, tended to overheat, and, if sufficient cooling water was not applied, seize up. Nevertheless, Scientific American reported, in September 1860, that the Parisian newspaper Cosmos had pronounced the steam age over. By 1865, 143 had been sold in Paris alone, and production of Lenoir Gas Engines, by Reading Gas Works in London, had begun. Lenoir had completed work on his engine in 1859 and had a grand unveiling on 23 January 1860, for twenty guests. In his speech he said, \\"If it works, I will add carburetor heating, at a constant level, which will allow the use of petrol, or gasoline, or tar, or any resin\\". He turned on the illuminating gas valve, pushed the flywheel, and the engine came to life. In 1860, Lenoir received a patent for \\"an air motor expanded by gas combustion\\" from Conservatoire National Des Arts Et M√©tiers, no. N.43624 Lenoir's automobiles Lenoir's Hippomobile Dates vary from 1860 to 1863 on when Lenoir built his automobiles. It is apparent that he built a small carriage with his engine around 1860. His automobile of 1862 was capable of 3 kilometers per hour. In 1861, he put one of his engines in a boat. In 1863, Lenoir demonstrated a second three-wheeled carriage, the Hippomobile, little more than a wagon body set atop a tricycle platform. It was powered by a 2543 cc (155 in3; 180√ó100 mm, 7.1√ó3.9in) 1.5 hp, \\"liquid hydrocarbon\\" (petroleum) engine with a primitive carburettor which was patented in 1886. It successfully covered the 11 km (7 mi) from Paris to Joinville-le-Pont and back in about ninety minutes each way, an average speed less than that of a walking man (though doubtless there were breakdowns). This succeeded in attracting the attention of Tsar Alexander II, and one was sent to Russia, where it vanished; Lenoir was not pleased. In 1863, he sold his patents to Compagnie parisienne de gaz and turned to motorboats instead, building the first naptha, a Ligroin fueled four-cycle in 1888.Ligroin Jules Verne wrote in his 1863 novel Paris in the Twentieth Century of boulevards crowded with horseless carriages, \\"the Lenoir machine applied to locomotion.\\" Stationary engines Most applications of the Lenoir engine were as a stationary power plant powering printing presses, water pumps, and machine tools. They \\"proved to be rough and noisy after prolonged use\\", however. Other engineers, especially Nicolaus Otto, began making improvements on internal combustion technology, which soon rendered the Lenoir design obsolete. Less than 500 Lenoir engines of between 6 and 20 hp were built, including some under license in Germany. Electrical engineering In 1865, Lenoir returned to electrical engineering. He developed a new type of automatic telegraph device that could send information in written form. This device was of great value during the Franco-Prussian War. He also installed an improved version of his engine in a 12 meter long boat for a Mr. Dalloz who used it on the Seine for two years.Franco-Prussian War French citizenship Lenoir was granted French citizenship in 1870 for assistance during the Franco-Prussian War, and awarded the L√©gion d'honneur in 1881 (not for the engine, but for developments in telegraphy).

They were founded in 1999 and their first team plays in the Premier Division of the Yorkshire Men's League. They have a junior section and in 2006 launched an academy team. They play their home matches at Highfields Sports Ground. They are also known as the 'hooded men'.  History of rugby league in Nottingham  The first Nottingham rugby league club took part in the Southern Amateur Rugby League some time between 1965 and 1973. The club is believed to have been a university team. In the late 1980s an attempt was made to introduce semi-professional rugby league into Nottingham with the creation of Nottingham City, who replaced another Nottinghamshire team, the Mansfield Marksman. In 1992-1993 they finished bottom of Division 3 of the Rugby League and were demoted to the National Conference League. They achieved the dubious honour of being the recipient of one of the widest margins of defeat in rugby league history when they lost 138-0 to Barrow in 1994. Official records Nottingham Foresters were the first community team to form in Nottingham. They were based at The Forester pub in the city centre; the landlord was one of the founder members. When the landlord left the following year the club relocated to The Crusader pub near the Nottingham Polytechnic playing fields, where the club played, and the club changed its name to Nottingham Crusaders in 1986. The club joined the now defunct Mansfield and Nottingham Amateur Rugby League Association, which later became the EMARLA (East Midlands Amateur Rugby League Association) league, and played there until 1995. Nottingham Crusaders then played in the Yorkshire League from 1995/96 to 1998/99 but kept an A-team in the EMARLA. History of the Outlaws Nottingham Outlaws RLFC were founded in 1998 when a number of players from the Nottingham Crusaders Yorkshire League outfit decided to explore the possibility of playing in the emerging Rugby League Conference. The newly founded Nottingham club took the name \\"Outlaws\\" in deference to the follows of local legend Robin Hood. The club colours were taken from the local Nottingham Trent University. The club joined the Northern Division of the Rugby League Conference that same year. In its early years the club were based in Wilford village at Nottingham Moderns RUFC. They moved to the newly created Midlands Division in 2001. As the Conference expanded further, new Divisions were added and in 2003, the Outlaws joined the East Midlands Division. After twice winning the East Midlands division in both 2003 and 2004 they accepted an invitation to join the new Central Premier Division in 2005. This was a step-up in standard and included tough games against rugby league heartland sides in Hull Phoenix, Leeds Akkies, Bolton-le-Moors and Dewsbury Celtic. In 2006 the club competed in the Midlands Premier division, finishing as league leaders and then winning the Midlands Grand Final against Coventry Bears. This set up a national semi-final against East Lancashire Lions, which they lost by 28-12. The Academy team reached the Merit League final but were beaten 42-18 by the South Humber Rabbitohs. The club again ran two teams in 2007, competing in the same competitions. The first team were beaten in the RLC Premier Midlands final 18-30 by Coventry Bears after finishing second in the league and the second team lost 26-32 to East Riding in the MML Shield Final. Three junior teams and a ladies team also competed for the club in 2007. In 2008, the club re-located from Moderns RUFC to The Bay, training ground of Nottingham RUFC; Leeds Akkies coach Martin Crick was recruited as Head Coach and a host of new signings from the powerful Loughborough University Rugby League team. The club achieved success, taking the Midlands Premier crown from Coventry Bears in a 44-0 win before beating Carlisle Centurions in the semi-final and then West London Sharks in the final to win the Harry Jepson Trophy for the first time in the club's history. The reserve grade side also won the RL Merit League Shield. The club also fielded a women's team and juniors at under-16, under-14, under-12 and under-11. the club applied for, and were granted, entrance to the RLC National Division in 2009. They made their debut in the Challenge Cup in January 2009 but lost narrowly to Loughborough University. In 2012 the heartlands winter leagues switched to summer and this led to a realignment of the community game. Outlaws were one of the few non-heartland teams to maintain a position at national level, operating in the 3rd tier of the national pyramid in the National Conference League Division 3. In 2013 the Outlaws switched to play in the newly formed Conference League South. The Outlaws reached the Grand Final in the competition's inaugural season, losing out 32-24 to Sheffield-Hallam Eagles. In 2014, they were prevented from reaching a second consecutive Grand Final after a semi-final defeat away to eventual champions Valley Cougars. In 2014, the Outlaws launched Project 30 - a scheme to raise money to help secure a permanent home for the club and the sport of rugby league in the city of Nottingham. In 2015 they lifted the Conference league south championship by beating defending champions Valley Cougars 39-12 at Bath In 2018, the club finally secured a permanent home at Lenton Lane, the former site of the now- defunct Greenwood Meadows FC. Juniors Nottingham Outlaws' junior teams take part in the Midlands Junior League. In 2009, Outlaws under-16s were crowned Midlands Champions, leading to a number of players being selected to represent the East Midlands and later the full Midlands teams. Numerous players have since gone on the achieve this at various age groups from under-12 to under-18. 2012 saw five Outlaws juniors being selected to tour Serbia with the Midlands under-18s. The successful development of players at the club has also seen players involved with professional clubs, Sheffield Eagles, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats and Castleford Tigers.

The building served as Administrative and Justice Palace until 1955, when its destination was changed, being assigned to the four museums nowadays united under the name of Moldavia National Museum Complex. Also, the building houses the Cultural Heritage Conservation-Restoration Centre, and hosts various exhibitions and other events. The Palace of Culture is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments.The Romanian Register of Historical Monuments in Ia≈üi County History The former Princely Palace of Moldavia (later renamed Administrative Palace) after the last renovation (1883) Located in the perimeter of the mediaeval Princely Court of Moldavia (from 1434), the construction was conceived as a rebuilding and expansion project of the former Princely Palace of Moldavia, dated to the time of Prince Alexandru Moruzi (1803‚Äì1806, architect Johan Freywald), and renovated by Prince Mihail Sturdza (1841‚Äì1843, architect Nicolae Singurov), from which it preserved the foundations and first two floors. It was from this latter building that the Palace inherited the legend of the 365 rooms, as many as the days within one year.Presentation The Romanian architect I.D. Berindei was assigned to plan and conduct the rebuilding process. Unlike the old palace, built in a neoclassical style, Berindei chose to design it in a flamboyant Neo-Gothic style. Started in 1906‚Äì1907, the reconstruction works were halted during World War I, due to the limitation of resources, but the unfinished building sheltered Romanian and Russian troops, and different public institutions and military hospitals. The monument was finally completed on 11 October 1925, and officially inaugurated one year later, by King Ferdinand I of Romania. The building housed the County Law Court and other public institutions until 1955, when it received an exclusive cultural function. During World War II, the Palace sheltered German troops, and then, Soviet troops. In 1975‚Äì1977, the wood bridging from the last floor was replaced with a cement one, fixed with steel netting. The new bridging sustained the monument during the earthquake of 1977, but the bridging from the first floor, the walls, the ornaments and the relief works were affected. A large-scale restoration project, considered one of the most complex in Romania since 1990, began in 2008.Un tur al Palatului Culturii √Ænainte de deschidere The main works were completed in April 2016.

The hall is superposed by a glass ceiling room, where initially a greenhouse was arranged. In spite of its archaic-looking design, the Palace was designed so to integrate modern materials and technologies. Thus, the stone blocks were replaced with light and much cheaper materials. Besides, some rooms were decorated using a special material licensed by Henri CoandƒÉ, under the name of bois-ciment and imitating the oak wood. Decorative ironmongery elements are also remarkable and they can be admired for instance on the doors of the Voivodes‚Äô Hall. The building was also equipped with high- tech facilities for those times, such as electric lighting, (pneumatic) heating, ventilation system, thermostat, vacuum cleaners, which were all directed from the machinery room, at the underground level. Taking also into account the 14 fires that affected the previous buildings, Berindei (the main architect) treated the wooden structure of the attic with an ignifugeous product called orniton, while for the roof he used a special material, named eternite. Clock Tower The entrance of the palace is through a great donjon tower, with crenels and alcoves dominated by an eagle with open wings. The tower is the central architectural piece of the palace. On each of the three exposed sides there is a face of the clock with a diameter of . The clock faces are decorated with stained glass representing the 12 astrological signs.

Zhang honored his father's wife Princess Yan as Grand Princess Dowager and his mother Lady Ma as Princess Dowager. Reign Zhang appeared to be a mediocre ruler, as he was criticized for spending too much time in games and pleasure. He also tended to trust flattering attendants, even though he was not criticized for being cruel or extravagant. In 349, Suo Zhen () tried to persuade him to spend less time on games and not to reward his attendants with too much money, but while Zhang Chonghua thanked him and rewarded him, he did not appear to change his ways significantly. Soon after Zhang Chonghua succeeded his father, Later Zhao forces, under the generals Wang Zhuo () and Ma Qiu, made a surprise attack against Former Liang, seizing Former Liang's territory south of the Yellow River, including the important city of Jincheng (ÈáëÂüé, in modern Lanzhou, Gansu). Zhang Chonghua commissioned Xie Ai to lead his army, and Xie was able to defeat Ma and Wang's forces in 346 and again in 347, forcing them to retreat from their original plans to destroy Former Liang, but the land south of the Yellow River could not be recovered. Also in 347, the Jin emissary Yu Gui () arrived in Former Liang to confer Zhang Chonghua a number of offices‚Äîbut not the one that Zhang Chonghua was looking for, Prince of Liang. He tried to persuade Yu to grant him that title, but Yu would not, and so he detained Yu (who would not be released until 363, long after Zhang Chonghua's death). Zhang appeared to have largely stood by as Later Zhao collapsed during 349 to 351. Most of the western territory of Later Zhao fell into the hands of the Di general Fu Ji√†n, who established Former Qin in 351. In late 352 or early 353, the ex-Later Zhao general Wang Zhuo, who had been holding parts of modern eastern Gansu and who had declared loyalty to Former Yan, could not resist Former Qin forces and surrendered to Zhang Chonghua, who treated him well, intending to use him as a general against Former Qin. In spring 353, he commissioned Wang, Zhang Hong (), and Song Xiu () to lead 15,000 men against Former Qin, but suffered a great loss‚Äîreportedly 12,000, or 80% of the army. Zhang and Song were captured, while Wang fled back to the capital Guzang (ÂßëËáß, in modern Wuwei, Gansu). In summer, however, Wang led 20,000 men and attacked Shanggui (‰∏äÈÇΩ, in modern Tianshui, Gansu), capturing most of Qin Province (Áß¶Â∑û, modern eastern Gansu). Zhang Chonghua then submitted a petition to Emperor Mu of Jin, requesting a campaign against Former Qin. Emperor Mu sent messengers to praise and bestow more honors on Zhang Chonghua, but the Jin government did not appear to be interested in attacking Former Qin at the time, so the plan was not carried out. Later that year, Zhang grew ill, and he designated his nine-year-old son Zhang Yaoling to be his heir apparent. His older brother Zhang Zuo the Marquess of Changning plotted with Zhang Chonghua's attendants Zhao Zhang () and Wei Qi () to take over power, and Zhao and Wei falsely accused Xie Ai of crimes and had him exiled from the capital to be the governor of Jiuquan Commandery (ÈÖíÊ≥â, roughly modern Jiuquan, Gansu). Xie submitted a petition accusing Zhang Zuo and Zhao of plotting, and in winter of that year, when Zhang Chonghua grew gravely ill, he tried to summon Xie back to the capital to serve as Zhang Yaoling's regent, but the order was seized by Zhang Zuo and Zhao and never announced. Era name? Most historical sources indicate that Zhang, like his grandfather Zhang Shi (), his granduncle Zhang Mao, and his father Zhang Jun, continued to use Emperor Min of Jin's era name Jianxing (both to show continued allegiance to Jin and to distance himself from Emperor Yuan of Jin and his line) but some sources indicate that he changed era name to Yongle (Ê∞∏Ê®Ç y«íng l√® 346-353). A current theory is that his era name was used internally while the Jianxing era name was used when communicating with other states. After Zhang's death, Zhang Zuo became regent, and in early 354 usurped the title from Zhang Yaoling. Personal  Zhang's wife was Princess Pei. Zhang's major concubine was Lady Guo, likely mother of Zhang Xuanjing. Zhang's children are Yaoling (ÂºµÊõúÈùà) (Duke Ai) and Xuanjing (ÂºµÁéÑÈùö), Duke Jingdao. In 353, Zhang's wife was executed by Zhang Zuo. In 353 Zhang died after a period of illness. Zhang was succeeded by Zhang Yaoling, under the title Duke of Xiping.

Their aircraft models are molded of a proprietary expanded polypropylene foam known as Elapor. The flexible nature of the material makes the company's models resistant to crash damage as well as easy assembly and repair with ordinary hobby-grade cyanoacrylate adhesives. The two-part epoxy commonly used in model assembly will not bind Elapor, nor will so-called \\"foam safe\\" cyanoacrylate adhesives used in the assembly and repair of EPS foam models.

The Mentor (now discontinued), a trainer aircraft which resembles a Cessna 180, is an electric-powered model similar in size and power to a .40 cubic inch/6.5cc glow engine-powered model. It is large and powerful enough to be used as a glider tug and parts are packed with the kit to allow the Mentor to be used as such. In 2010, the company introduced its first helicopter model, the Funcopter. The model features an Elapor fuselage and a direct drive rotor system, eliminating the need for the drive gears and one-way bearings found in many other models. Also introduced in 2010 was the FunJET Ultra. The original FunJET is a popular subject for modification, with heavily modified examples capable of greater than 130 MPH (210 km/h). The Ultra addresses the problems inherent in such modifications with a combination of denser Elapor, improved aerodynamics with the elimination of the simulated wing tanks and an updated motor mount.

In its upper reaches peaty water flows over a bottom of shingle and rock and is fast flowing. Before being bridged, the river had to be crossed by \\"an uncertain ferry which would have landed you somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Old Market Place\\". The first bridge, built in 1765, was swept away three years later, followed in 1773 by the sinking of the ferry. A new one, designed by John Smeaton, was completed in 1779. The river has its source in the Ladder Hills between Glenbuchat and the Cabrach, part of the Grampian range. It begins as a small highland stream among peaty and heather covered country before leaving the hills and entering the rolling lowlands of fertile farmland. The two main streams in its upper course are the Alt Deveron and the Black Water. Some 17 miles downstream from the river's source, the river passes through the town of Huntly, where it is joined by its tributary, the River Bogie. Four miles further downstream the Deveron's second tributary, the River Isla flows in from the northwest.

A member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Fergason is best known for his work on an improved Liquid Crystal Display, or LCD. He held over one hundred U.S. patents at the time of his death. Early life and education James Lee \\"Jim\\" Fergason was born on a farm near the small town of Wakenda, Carroll County, Missouri. He was educated in a one-room schoolhouse until the 7th grade when his family moved to the county seat of Carrollton. The Fergason family had something of a reputation for educational over achievement. One grandfather graduated from college at age fifteen, while two of Fergason's older brothers studied chemical engineering and electrical engineering respectively. A cousin was an agricultural engineer who had over 100 patents for his machinery inventions. Following his graduation from Carrollton High School in 1952 he enrolled at the University of Missouri, earning a Bachelor's Degree in physics in 1956. Fergason married his wife Dora the week after graduation from Mizzou, then reported for a brief tour of duty as a second lieutenant with the United States Army in Texas. Professional career After his discharge from the Army, Fergason was hired by Westinghouse Research Laboratories in Pennsylvania. At Westinghouse he began groundbreaking work with cholesteric liquid crystals, forming the first industrial research group into the practical uses of the technology. For this work Fergason earned his first patent () in 1963. Among the later uses for his research and first patent were the 1970s pop culture icon the mood ring, and the Liquid crystal thermometer. In June 1966, Fergason joined the Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University as its associate director. Here, in 1969, he made his seminal discovery of a low-power, field-operated LC display, known as the twisted nematic cell, and received a patent.()Patent US3731986: Display devices utilizing liquid crystal light modification. Filed on 22 April 1971, published 8 May 1973. Inventor: James L. Fergason. There was a controversy about this invention. The inventors Martin Schadt and Wolfgang HelfrichWolfgang Helfrich. Engineering and Technology History Wiki. Retrieved 27 May 2020. of Hoffmann-La Roche had filed a Swiss patent application for the same invention at an earlier international priority date than Fergason in 1970.Patent CH532261: Lichtsteuerzelle. Filed on 4 December 1970, published on 31 December 1972. Inventors: Wolfgang Helfrich, Martin Schadt. However, a US patent was granted to Fergason due to a predated US patent notebook entry in 1970. All three were awarded the IEEE Jun-ichi Nishizawa Medal in 2008 for this invention. Also at LCI, Fergason was part of an effort to use cholesteric liquid crystals for thermal mapping, in particular, to screen for breast cancer. He participated in the discovery of smectic C liquid crystal phase. Twisted nematic liquid crystal displays were superior to the earlier dynamic scattering displays, and soon became widespread. The technology was patented in the United States by Fergason in 1971. He formed his own company, ILIXCO, in 1968 to manufacture liquid crystal displays. His first customers were the Bulova Watch Company and Gruen Watch Company which used the technology to market the first LCD watches using this technology. By the end of the decade, most of the world's digital watches used this kind of LCD. Fergason held over 150 patents in the United States and over 500 foreign patents. He also was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2001, he founded Fergason Patent Properties, which managed licensing of his patents. In 2001, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Missouri, in 2006 he was the recipient of the Lemelson-MIT Prize, in 2007 he was awarded the David Richardson Medal by the Optical Society of America, and in 2008 he received the Jun-Ichi Nishizawa Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Death Fergason died at age 74. He was survived by his wife Dora and their four children, Teresa, Jeffrey, John and Susan, and his 11 grandchildren.

Perhaps Love became one of the year's top-grossing films in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and received a record 29 awards. Chan next directed The Warlords (2007) and produced Derek Yee's Prot√©g√© (2007). The two films were the two highest grossing Hong Kong-China co-productions of 2007. The Warlords grossed a record RMB220 million in China and over US$40 million across Asia, and garnered 8 Hong Kong Film Awards and 3 Golden Horse Awards, including Best Director and Best Feature Film. In 2009, Chan produced Teddy Chen's Bodyguards and Assassins, which has garnered a spectacular RMB300 million in China box office alone, accumulating over US$50 million Asia-wide. It has scored a stunning 8 awards in the Hong Kong Film Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Nicholas Tse, Best Action Choreography, among others. It also won Best Actor awards for Wang Xueqi in the Asian Film Awards and the HK Film Critics Society Awards, adding up to an impressive 146 awards out of 231 nominations for Chan's awards track record. In a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council during the 2010 Hong Kong Filmart, Chan was voted \\"the most valuable filmmaker\\", which was strongly backed by his box-office track records. Chan dated Kathleen Poh for a brief period in 1993 before Poh moved to Singapore permanently. Chan currently has a daughter Jilian Chan (born in 2006) with Hong Kong actress Sandra Ng, although the two have no intention of getting married.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History Muncaster Castle circa 1880 The place is now corruptly known as \\"Muncaster\\", which first appeared in a Cumberland church register in 1577, the original name according to all old evidence and records being \\"Mulcaster\\", registered in the pipe rolls of Cumberland circa 1150 (also as Molecaster and Mulecaster in 1190 and 1236 respectively). The placename \\"Muncaster\\" contains the Latin word castra, meaning \\"encampment\\", or \\"fort\\". It is suspected that the site of the castle lies on foundations dating to the Roman era, which, if they exist, may represent a castellum for the nearby Roman fort of Glannoventa at Ravenglass. The Muncaster estate was granted to Alan de Penitone in 1208. The oldest parts of the castle include the Great Hall and the 14th-century pele tower, a type of watch-tower fortification unique to the English-Scottish border region. Between 1860 and 1866 Anthony Salvin extensively remodelled Muncaster Castle for the Barons Muncaster. Sir John Frecheville Ramsden, 6th Baronet discussed proposed modifications to the castle with Edwin Lutyens from 1916, but nothing came of these; Lutyens did design the Muncaster War Memorial, constructed in 1922, on a commission from Ramsden. Muncaster's gardens include features designed to take advantage of views of the Esk Valley and the mountains. There is an owl sanctuary, and a maze. Muncaster Castle is still owned by the Pennington family, who have lived at Muncaster for at least 800 years, and a family residence. Until her death in 2011, Phyllida Gordon-Duff-Pennington worked for three decades to restore the castle from a \\"crumbling relic\\" and establish it as a place for tourism and events. It now has more than 90,000 visitors a year. The Luck of Muncaster After the Battle of Towton in 1461, according to tradition, Henry VI fled to Muncaster Castle where Sir John Pennington sheltered him. Henry gave Sir John a glass drinking bowl, in the hope that they should prosper so long as it remained unbroken. The glass, which is still intact, and still at the castle, is now known as 'The Luck of Muncaster'.  Tom Fool  Each year the castle recruits its own jester in the culmination of a competition that celebrates the art of tomfoolery. The original jester, named Tom Skelton, whose full-length portrait hangs at the castle, is believed to be the original Tom Fool, who is often said to have inspired Shakespeare's Fool in King Lear. Legend has it that Skelton was enlisted by Wild Will of Whitbeck to behead a carpenter's son, Dick, a servant at the castle, who was an unwanted suitor of his betrothed, Helwise Pennington, the unmarried daughter of Sir Alan Pennington.

Until recently it was best known for Powderhall Stadium, a greyhound racing track, which has now closed. The stadium also played host to motorcycle speedway racing from 1977 to 1995, as home to the Edinburgh Monarchs, who have since relocated to Armadale. The Powderhall Sprint, first held in 1870, was a professional footrace with handicapping of the runners. It continues, since 1999, as the New Year Sprint and is now held at Musselburgh Racecourse. The name derives from a gunpowder factory and associated buildings on the edge of the Water of Leith set up by the Balfour family of Pilrig as one of their several enterprises in the early 18th century. The site has been redeveloped for housing and business purposes, with the area having become casually (and for marketing purposes) known by the names ‚ÄúPowderhall Village‚Äù and, alternatively, ‚ÄúCanonmills Gardens‚Äù. This draws attention to its mixed identity as both a desirable village inofitself, and as a natural part of the Canonmills area. Most residents use the Warriston Path, through trees and over disused railway tracks (and a bridge), to get to central Canonmills, George V Park (through a tunnel),the Royal Botanic Garden or, further along, Stockbridge. Following the path downriver through Bonnington ends up at the Shore, Leith. East Powderhall was once the location of the city's main waste management depots. Originally built as an incinerator, a new chimney on the plant was condemned in the 1990s and removed. Construction is now underway to convert the pand into mixed-use housing, green spaces, and art studios. In this way, Powderhall is an increasingly successful example of an area that unites reclaimed land, post- industrial aesthetics, ongoing industrial processed, relatively unaltered green spaces, and ultra-modern urban housing.

It is the product of both the class II and III phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) activity on phosphatidylinositol. PtdIns3P is dephosphorylated by the myotubularin family of phosphatases, on the D3 position of the inositol ring, and can be converted to PtdIns(3,5)P2 by the lipid kinase PIKfyve. Both FYVE domains and PX domains - found in proteins such as SNX1, HGS, and EEA1 - bind to PtdIns3P. The majority of PtdIns3P appears to be constitutively synthesised by the class III PI 3-kinase, PIK3C3 (Vps34), at endocytic membranes. Class II PI 3-kinases also appear to synthesise PtdIns3P, their activity however appears to be regulated by a range of stimuli, including growth factors. This suggests that specific pools of PtdIns3P may be synthesised upon cell stimulation.

He told Muhammad of his loss for God to which Muhammad said ‚ÄúWhich would you prefer: An eye in heaven or shall I pray to Allah that he brings it back?‚Äù To this Abu Sufyan said he would rather have his eye in heaven. He lost his other eye in the Battle of Yarmouk.Sahaba.net :: Stories of the Companions - An Eye Now or an Eye in Heaven? Blockade of Ta'if A few unsuccessful tries were made by Muhammad's forces to break through the gates of Ta'if. Muhammad may have even used the Roman Testudo formation in this siege, but it was reported that the inhabitants of Ta'if were able to break this siege by dropping hot irons upon the Muslim armies from the city walls. Muhammad allegedly told the people of Ta'if that he would burn and cut down their vineyard, as he saw no other way to make them surrender. Muhammad angered the citizens of Ta'if by offering freedom to slaves who surrendered themselves to Islam. However, only ten people were able to avail themselves of this option and become followers of Muhammad. The siege went on for half a month with little change and soldiers became very impatient. Following consultation with advisors and a prophetic dream, Muhammad ended the siege and withdrew his forces. To aid in the siege of Ta'if, Muhammad sought to get the chief of the Banu Hawazan (called Malik) on his side, and promised the release of his family and the return of all his property if Malik embraced Islam. Malik accepted the offer and became a Muslim, aiding Muhammad in his blockade of Ta'if. Malik disrupted the ability of the citizens of Ta'ir to graze their cattle outside of the city, further increasing the difficulty of life inside the walls.The life of Mahomet and history of Islam to the era of the Hegira: Volume 4, By Sir William Muir, Pg 155 Aftermath Although the siege was very unsuccessful, Muhammad vowed to return to Ta'if after the sacred months in which fighting was forbidden were over.

They demanded that Muhammad let them continue to worship their goddess Al-lƒÅt for a period of three years, yet had conspired to have him assassinated. When this conspiracy was discovered, and their ambush failed, Muhammad refused the proposal and would only accept their surrender if they agreed to disarm. Eventually the Banu Thaqif consented to Muhammad's request, so they then surrendered and allowed the Muslims into their city.

Friedman (October 9, 1900 in Cleveland, Ohio - June 21, 1982) was an independent American inventor with a broad range of interests and ideas. Friedman was a first generation American and the fifth of eight children of Jacob David Friedman and Antoinette Grauer Friedman. Early years By the age of fourteen, had conceptualized his first invention, the lighted pencil, which he deemed the \\"pencilite,\\" and was attempting to market his idea. Over the course of his inventing career, he would experiment with ideas ranging from writing implements to engine improvements, and household products to sound and optic experiments. He was issued nine U.S. patents and held patents in Great Britain, Australia and Canada. His first patent was issued for improvements to the fountain pen on April 18, 1922.(U.S. patent #1,412,930) This was also the first invention that he successfully sold, to the Sheaffer Pen Company in the mid-1930s. In the 1920s, Friedman began his education in real estate and optometry. He would use both of these careers at different points in his life to supplement his income while improving his invention concepts. Although he was working as a realtor in San Francisco, California, the 1930s proved to be his most prolific patenting period, with six of his nine U.S. patents being issued then. One of these patents would prove to be his most successful invention - the flexible drinking straw. Invention of the flexible straw While sitting in his younger brother Albert's fountain parlor, the Varsity Sweet Shop in San Francisco (200 19th Avenue), Friedman observed his young daughter Judith at the counter, struggling to drink out of a straight straw. He took a paper straight straw, inserted a screw and using dental floss, he wrapped the paper into the screw threads, creating corrugations. After removing the screw, the altered paper straw would bend conveniently over the edge of the glass, allowing small children to better reach their beverages. U.S. patent #2,094,268 was issued for this new invention under the title Drinking Tube, on September 28, 1937. Friedman would later file and be issued two additional U.S. patents and three foreign patents in the 1950s relating to its formation and construction. Friedman attempted to sell his straw patent to several existing straw manufacturers beginning in 1937 without success, so after completing his straw machine, he began to produce the straw himself. Friedman's younger English relative, Michael Fabricant MP, would later write that his great uncle's invention was \\"arguably the most significant technological achievement of the twentieth century\\". The Flexible Straw Corporation The Flexible Straw Corporation was incorporated on April 24, 1939 in California. However, World War II interrupted Friedman's efforts to construct his straw manufacturing machine. During the war, he managed the optometry practice of Arthur Euler, O.D., in Capwells' Department Store in Oakland, California, and continued to sell real estate and insurance to support his growing family. Friedman obtained financial backing for his flexible straw machine from two of his brothers-in-law, Harry Zavin and David Light, as well as from Bert Klein, a family associate. With their financial help, and the business advice of his sister Betty, Friedman completed the first flexible straw manufacturing machine in the late 1940s. Although his original concept had come from the observation of his daughter, the flexible straw was initially marketed to hospitals, with the first sale made in 1947.Smithsonian Institution It is now cited as an early example of Design for All.Feo, Roberto & Hurtado, Rosario & Optimastudio Dise√±os para Todos/Designs for All Madrid 2008 Dise√±os para Todos/Designs for All published in 2008 by Optimastudio with the support of Spain's Ministry of Education, Social Affairs and Sports (IMSERSO) and CEAPAT Downloadable free version of Designs for All Role of Betty Friedman Betty Friedman played a crucial role in the development of the Flexible Straw Corporation. While still living in Cleveland and working at the Tarbonis Company, she corresponded regularly with her brother and directed all of the sales and distribution of the straw. In 1950 Friedman moved his family and company to Santa Monica, California. Now doing business as the Flex-Straw Co., sales continued to increase and the marketing direction expanded to focus more strongly on the home and child markets. Betty Friedman moved west in 1954 to assume her formal leadership role in the corporation. Additional partners and investors were added over time, including Art Shapiro, who was initially solicited as a potential buyer of the patent. On June 20, 1969, the Flexible Straw Corporation sold its United States and foreign patents, United States and Canadian trademarks, and licensing agreements to the Maryland Cup Corporation. The Flexible Straw Corporation dissolved on August 19, 1969. Death On his death in 1982, Friedman was survived by his wife of over 50 years, Marjorie Lewis Friedman, his four children, Judith, Linda, Pamela and Robert, and nine grandchildren (John, Phil, Laurie (Laurel), Matt, Doug, Steve, Michael, Elizabeth and Johanna.

Plexus Publishing, p. 157. had his Broadway debut in \\"The Affair\\" (1962), and played in A Thousand Clowns, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and others, plus more Shakespeare, such as Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and Henry IV, Part 1, as well as the U.S. tour of Beyond The Fringe (1965). Television He became the star of a series of commercials for a cigarette, in which he played what Fabiani himself described as a \\"watered-down James Bond character\\", usually wearing a tuxedo and being surrounded by beautiful girls while smoking that particular brand of cigarette. His first small roles on television shows were in Love of Life and The Doctors (in 1963, and later again in 1968), Look Up and Live (1964) and Dark Shadows (1966). Afterwards he played Dr. Schley in the pilot episode of Ironside (1967). Department S Fabiani and his wife moved to the United Kingdom, where he co-starred in Department S. The show is considered to be a forerunner of The X-Files and deals with a special branch of Interpol dealing with particularly baffling cases that other agencies had failed to solve. Fabiani played the field team leader Stewart Sullivan, a pragmatic man of action and determination and a bit of a temper to go with it. In episode 2, \\"The Trojan Tanker\\", Fabiani was once more in a tuxedo, gambling in a casino, and looking very Bond-ish; and there were several episodes in which he wore the tuxedo at least for one scene, usually whenever he was meeting the head of the Department, Sir Curtis, for a briefing during some gala, opera or exclusive party. Like most SpyFi shows of the 1960s, Department S did have elements of Bond. Episode 7 for instance, \\"Handicap ‚Äì Dead\\", where Sullivan attends a golf tournament in Scotland and ends up investigating the suspicious death of one of the golfers, was inspired by Goldfinger. Fabiani was highly esteemed and appreciated by his fellow cast members. Guest star Kate O'Mara described him as \\"most charming\\" and a \\"perfect American gentleman\\". His co-star Rosemary Nicols called him \\"a very sweet guy, and extremely professional. He always came prepared, and he knew exactly what he was doing.\\" And Peter Wyngarde declared, \\"Joel was wonderful!\\" The show ran successfully in the UK and was syndicated worldwide, including the US, where it ran for its full season-length. At one point in the early 1970s it was voted the most popular series in the world.Cult TV, p.205 However, the producers set their sights on other projects, such as the equally short-lived spin-off \\"Jason King\\" Cult TV, p.205 and the Roger Moore/Tony Curtis-show \\"The Persuaders!\\", which also only ran for one season. \\"For his part, Fabiani wasn't too disappointed that no more episodes were commissioned. 'When I came back to the States from England, I [‚Ä¶] wanted to go out and conquer Hollywood, which is what I immediately set out to do ‚Äì and didn't ‚Äì but I had an awful lot of fun trying.' \\" Cult TV, p.162 Hollywood Fabiani returned to television work, at first still very much in line with his Department S character, such as playing the FBI agent Barris in the TV movie The Longest Night (1972) opposite David Janssen. Then he went on to guest star in many other television shows, including The FBI, Banacek, Barnaby Jones, Cannon, The Streets of San Francisco, The Rockford Files, Matt Helm, S.W.A.T., Starsky & Hutch, Columbo and Black Sheep Squadron, playing good guys and villains alike, from lawyers, prosecutors and doctors to pilots, P.I.s and gangsters. He also appeared in numerous TV movies, including Brenda Starr (1976) with Jill St. John, thrillers like the Edgar Allan Poe Award-nominated One of My Wives Is Missing (1976) with Jack Klugman and The President's Mistress (1978) with Beau Bridges and Larry Hagman, and the prison movie Attica (1980) with Morgan Freeman, which was nominated for several Emmys and won one. In between, he still worked in the theatre, appearing in Broadway plays such as Love for Love (1974) and Luigi Pirandello's The Rules of the Game (1975, as Barelli) ‚Äì a show that was also featured in the PBS Great Performances series ‚Äì as well as \\"Ashes\\" (1977, as Colin), the original run of the musical I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It on the Road (1978, as Joe Epstein), the courtroom drama As To The Meaning of Words (1981, as Alexander Thomas), and more. In addition he appeared in several feature films, including high-profile movies such as Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977), the Oscar-nominated Reuben, Reuben (1983), and Tune In Tomorrow (1990). Others were the independent movie Dark Echoes (1977), which, ahead of its time, was a kind of forerunner of John Carpenter's The Fog (1980), and mainstream movies like Snake Eyes (1998). Prime time dramas From the 1980s on, he had several recurring roles in prime time soaps, where he appeared as publisher Alex Ward in Dallas Dallas ‚Äì The Complete Story by Barbara A. Curran and played the role of King Galen of Moldavia on Dynasty,Dynasty High: A Guide to TV's \\"Dynasty\\" by Billie Ray Bates where his son's wedding, unceremoniously interrupted by terrorists shooting at the gathered crowd, provided the famous season 5 cliffhanger finale. The viewers then had to wait quite a while until it was finally revealed that most of the characters, including King Galen, had ‚Äì despite initial rumors to the contrary ‚Äì indeed survived the attack. Fabiani also guest starred in Hotel, and had the somewhat difficult task of assessing Jane Wyman's mental capacities as Dr. Quentin King in Falcon Crest.Prime Time Network Serials: Episodes, Casts and Credits by Bruce B. Morris Later he moved back to New York, and also played in day time dramas, where he served as temporary replacement for Michael Zaslow as Roger Thorpe three times on Guiding Light in August 1992, early 1994 and late May to June 1995 while Zaslow was on personal leave,IMDb ‚Äì Joel Fabiani played a major part in The City as Jared Chase in 1996, had a recurring role in As the World Turns as Winston Lowe/\\"Mr. Smith\\" in 2000 and a long run on All My Children (from 1999-2010) as Barry Shire (whom a soap magazine labelled a \\"bona fide scene stealer\\" Soap Opera Weekly, \\"Who Is Who In All The Soaps\\", in 2001.), a lawyer who never seemed to run out of work trying to get either Chandler Enterprises or various members of the Chandler clan out of trouble, out of court, or out of jail... or all of the above. (Or, as the magazine put it, \\"Adam's crazy antics on AMC keep Barry - and Fabiani - busy!\\" Soap Opera Weekly, article by Valerie Davison ) He continued to guest star in other shows too, including Murder, She Wrote (in 1992 and 1994), Third Watch (2000), Law & Order (2004) and Law and Order: Criminal Intent (2004). The latter's episode meant a reunion with Claire Bloom - with whom he had worked over thirty years before in the theater - and centered around the events at a fundraiser. In between he had occasional parts in TV comedy series, such as The Cosby Show (1988), Strangers With Candy (2000) and Ed (2003), and also kept appearing in plays in the theater.Cf. Theatre World Publications Other projects Apart from that, he appeared as presenter in theater documentaries, such as \\"Ghosts of Glory\\" about Eugene O\\"Neill and his plays, which was hosted by Joanne Woodward, and as narrator on several Barbara Walters Specials. Fabiani, who \\"has an uncanny ability to imitate numerous voices, moods, and inflections\\" Review - \\"Aces and Eights\\" Audiobook also narrates audio books, including Norman McLean's \\"A River Runs Through It\\", Conrad Richter's \\"The Light in the Forest\\" and Loren D. Estleman's award-winning \\"Aces and Eights\\". Other notes In 2008, when The Smiths released their album \\"Singles Box\\" (Cf.The Smiths Singles Box), Morrissey personally chose a PR picture of Joel Fabiani (from 1970, for Department S) as the cover for the album. At the very beginning of his career, he was married to Katharine Ross. (They first met and started dating at Santa Rosa Junior College in 1957, then later resumed dating when studying at the San Francisco Actors Workshop together.) They married on February 28, 1960 and later divorced after about two and a half years of marriage, in 1962. Fabiani then married actress Audree Rae, whom he also met while they were doing a stage play together. This proved to be a long-lasting relationship (until her death in 2009), while Ross went on to have four more husbands. While Fabiani and Ross had appeared on stage together, they never had any screen appearances together. (The closest they came was in 1985/86, when Ross appeared on the Dynasty spinoff The Colbys, while Fabiani appeared on Dynasty.Goodman, Dean. San Francisco Stages - A Concise History, 1849-1986.

It is located on the south side of the Firth of Forth, southeast of South Queensferry and west of Edinburgh city centre. It lies within the traditional boundaries of West Lothian, and falls under the local governance of the City of Edinburgh Council. Name history The 13th century form of the name, Dunmanyn (later Dunmanie and then Damenie, hence the modern form), indicates that the first element is Britonnic din or Gaelic dun, a fort. A derivation from dun managh, \\"monk's fort\\", is unconvincing: there is no evidence to suggest there was ever a monastic settlement at Dalmeny. The name may rather be from din meyni, \\"stony fort\\", or din meyn an, \\"place of the stone fort\\", in reference to the ancient triple-walled fort that once stood on Craigie Hill in the east of the parish. The second element has also been connected with Manau, an ancient name for the lands adjoining the Forth, which would give a meaning of \\"fort of Manau\\" (compare Slamannan, \\"mount of Manau\\", and Clackmannan, \\"stone of Manau\\"). Infrastructure The village has a primary school, which teaches about a hundred pupils, and a railway station near the south end of the Forth Bridge, which also serves the larger town of Queensferry. Parish Church Dalmeny Church circa 1900 The present church building was built around 1130, possibly by Gospatric, Earl of Dunbar, and is recognised as the finest Norman/Romanesque parish church still in use in Scotland, and one of the most complete in the United Kingdom, lacking only its original western tower, which was replaced in a sympathetic style in 1937 having been long absent.Buildings of Scotland: Lothian, by Colin McWilliam The aisleless nave, choir and apse survive almost complete from the 12th century. The refined sculptural detail of the chancel and apse arches is notable, as is a series of powerful beast-head corbels supporting the apse vault. These features are also extremely well preserved, with the original tool-marks still visible. The elaborate south doorway is carved with symbols representing a bestiary and an \\"agnus dei\\", enlivened with blind arcading above. The door is comparable to the north door at Dunfermline Abbey. Nearby is a rare 12th-century sarcophagus carved with 13 doll-like figures (possibly Christ and the 12 apostles) in niches (now very weathered). The churchyard also has a number of fine 17th- and 18th-century gravestones. Interments in the churchyard include the advocate and historian John Hill Burton (1809‚Äì81). The north (Rosebery) aisle dates from 1671 and was remodelled in the late 19th century. This has elaborate but \\"inaccurate\\" Neo-Norman details. The church is a category A listed building.

It is speculated that it is built on a pre-Christian burial mound.Investigation on pre-Christian influences on Christian architecture; dissertation, University of Edinburgh, 1983 (Stephen C. Dickson) This would mean that the graveyard predates the church. A second detached mound of smaller size lies on the east road out of the village. This pre-dating is further evidenced by the 7th-century coffin stone near the door which appears to have been dug up during the 1937 restoration. Besides the parish church, the most significant buildings are Dalmeny House and Barnbougle Castle, to the east of the village, home to the Earl of Rosebery. The most notable earl was Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, who served as Prime Minister from 1894 to 1895 and is the grandfather of the present earl. The village itself consists of early 19th-century cottages along the main street (built at the same time as Dalmeny House), with 20th-century housing to the south close to the A90. To the south of the A90 is the Dalmeny Tank Farm, a large oil-storage facility formerly operated by BP, but since 2018 by INEOS. The facility was constructed in the 1970s on a former oil shale mine, and is screened by a mound of the waste material from the mine. Oil is transferred from the site to tankers moored at the Hound Point Terminal in the Firth of Forth. Dalmeny, along with Queensferry, Kirkliston, Cammo, Cramond, Barnton, Silverknowes, Gogar, Hermiston, and Newbridge, forms the Almond electoral ward of the City of Edinburgh Council.

He founded 11 schools for the middle classes in England whose aim was to provide education based on \\"sound principle and sound knowledge, firmly grounded in the Christian faith\\". His educational principles are promoted today through the Woodard Corporation, a registered charity. Early life Woodard was born at Basildon Hall in Essex (now known as Barstable Hall) the son of John Woodard, a country gentleman of limited means. He was brought up and educated privately by his mother Mary n√©e Silley, a pious and devout woman. In 1834 he entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College, Oxford), where his academic studies were interrupted by his marriage in 1836 to Harriet Brill, although he took a pass degree in 1840. As a result of the influence of his mother, Woodard's religious sympathies were Evangelical when he first became a student at Oxford, but, whilst he was there, he soon found himself strongly drawn to the growing Tractarian Movement and, as a result, developed Anglo-Catholic sympathies that he kept for the remainder of his life. Career Tomb of Nathaniel Woodard in Lancing College Chapel He was ordained in 1841 and obtained a curacy at St Bartholomew's, Bethnal Green. Here he started a church school for the children of deprived parishioners. As a result of a controversial sermon - in which he argued that The Book of Common Prayer should include separate provision for confession and absolution - he was moved to another curacy at St. James the Greater, Clapton. In 1846, obtaining a curacy at St Mary de Haura Church in New Shoreham, he was again struck by the poverty, and the lack of education amongst his middle class parishioners‚Äîmany of whom were less well educated than many of their employees who had been educated in the parochial school. He opened a day school in his vicarage, and in 1848 he started St Nicolas' School, which took boarders. This was merged in 1849 to form the College of St Mary and St Nicolas, which eventually formed the present day Lancing College. It was from these beginnings that he started to work full-time on promoting educational projects, resigning from his curacy in 1850. Woodard was supported in these endeavours by Edward Clarke Lowe, headmaster and director of many of the schools, who prevailed upon him in 1874 to provide for the education of women at the schools founded in Abbots Bromley. The extent of his success was recognised in 1870 when Oxford University bestowed on him the degree of DCL and he was made Canon of Manchester Cathedral by Gladstone. Woodard used the majority of the generous stipend which went with his position as Canon towards the funds for building the schools. In accordance with his firm Anglo-Catholic beliefs, and in contrast to similar although less successful work by Joseph Lloyd Brereton there were no concessions to either those Anglicans of the low church or to those belonging to non-conformist churches. The efforts of Woodard and his supporters raised about ¬£500,000 by the time of his death in 1891, and Woodard succeeded in gaining the admiration of people like William Ewart Gladstone and Matthew Arnold. His tomb is in the chapel of Lancing College. Schools In his lifetime Nathaniel Woodard founded eleven schools and acquired a number of others.Janet Pennington, \\"Woodard, Nathaniel (1811‚Äì1891)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008 accessed 21 Nov 2012 These include: *1848: Lancing College *1849: Hurstpierpoint College *1858: Ardingly College *1868: Denstone College (formerly: St Chad's) *1874: Abbots Bromley School for Girls (formerly: the School of St Mary and St Anne) *1880: King's College (Taunton) *1884: Ellesmere College (formerly: St Oswald's School) *1890: Worksop College (formerly: St Cuthbert's College) *1912: Queen Ethelburga's Collegiate Legacy The schools he founded became known collectively as the \\"Woodard Schools\\", being joined by others to form an influential group.

Biography M√ºller was born in Herford, while he was educated at Leipzig. In 1725, he was invited to St. Petersburg to co-found the Imperial Academy of Sciences. M√ºller participated in the second Kamchatka expedition, which reported on life and nature of the further (eastern) side of the Ural mountain range. From 1733 till 1743, nineteen scientists and artists traveled through Siberia to study people, cultures and collected data for the creation of maps. M√ºller, who described and categorized clothing, religions and rituals of the Siberian ethnic groups, is considered to be the father of ethnography. On his return from Siberia, he became historiographer to the Russian Empire. He was one of the first historians to bring out a general account of Russian history based on an extensive examination of the documentary sources. His accentuation of the role of Scandinavians and Germans in the history of that country ‚Äì a germ of the so-called Normanist theory ‚Äì earned him enmity of Mikhail Lomonosov, who had previously supported his work, and dented his Russian career. In 1766, after many attacks by his colleagues, M√ºller was appointed keeper of the national archives. He drew up for the government a collection of its treatises.

Enrollment fell significantly from millions to hundreds and it lost its authority to govern all martial arts organizations in Japan. In 1946, due to its association with the Japanese Military during wartime, the GHQ dissolved the DNBK. The following years, more than 1,300 leaders and officials of the DNBK were purged‚Äîostracized, lost their jobs, and were forbidden to take any government position. In 1953, a new unrelated DNBK was established with a new philosophical vision of preserving the long-standing illustrious classical martial virtues and traditions.\\"What is the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai? History=The Establishment of the Original Military School The original Dai Nippon Butoku Kai facility was created as a private organization in 1895 in Kyoto.\\"A Reconsideration of the Dai-Nippon Butokukai in the Purge of Ultra- nationalism and Militarism in Post-war Japan\\" by Alexander Bennett Ph.D.(Kansai University) By the 1930s a systematic appropriation of martial arts by the state was underway, fueled in the successful wake of the Russo- Japanese War, sped up even more in 1942-1945 during the apex of Japan's \\"militarisation\\"(sengika.) This led to a number of \\"unprecedented policies aimed at making martial arts education combat effective and ideologically aligned with ultra-nationalistic government policy\\" were set into motion. This strove to corral any and all budo organizations under state control to which the proposal of the \\"National Physical Strength Deliberation Council\\" sponsored by the Ministry of Health and Welfare recommended that an \\"all- encompassing extra-governmental organization\\" formed between the five ministries of K≈çseish≈ç (Health and Welfare), Mombush≈ç (Education), Rikugunsh≈ç (Army), Kaigunsh≈ç (Navy) and the Naimush≈ç (Home) which promoted bud≈ç in schools, community organizations and groups. This was an effective way to expand the reach and breadth of the harmful propaganda being issued by the ultra nationalistic government into the community, plus allowing a clear path to community indoctrination through bud≈ç programs; especially notable was the efforts targeting children and schools that is apparent by the amount of funding it received, allocated by a national budget at the time. The response was as follows: \\"We have reached a consensus to restructure the Dai-Nippon Butokukai, a registered society that has contributed to the advancement of bud≈ç for many years, and incorporate it into the organs of government.\\" This allowed public funding to be spent on a larger project nationally. After the end of World War II, the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers (General Douglas MacArthur) issued a directive to dissolve any and all military-related or nationalistic propaganda organizations. The disbanding was done under the \\"Removal and Exclusion of Undesirable Personnel from Public Office,\\" which issued a purge directive contained in SCAPIN9 548 (Removal of Ultranationalists) clearly stating: \\"ultra-nationalistic or militaristic social, political, professional and commercial societies and institutions will be dissolved and prohibited.\\" This was accompanied by SCAPIN 550 (Removal and Exclusion of Undesirable Personnel from Public Office) which states: \\"Persons who have been active exponents of militarism and militant nationalism will be removed and excluded from public office and from any positions of public or substantial private responsibility.\\" In a memorandum proposed to the Chief of Staff, it also stated: \\"Dissolution of Dai Nippon Butokukai by order to the Imperial Japanese Government is recommended in accordance with the provisions of SCAPIN 548 Paragraph I-f on the grounds that this is an organization 'affording military or quasi-military training' and which provides for the 'perpetuation of militarism' or a martial spirit in Japan.\\" The Reestablishment of DNBK In 1953, a non-related brand new organization with the name Dai Nippon Butoku Kai was established with the philosophical vision of preserving the long-standing illustrious classical martial virtues and traditions. This new DNBK aims for the restoration of classical martial cultures, supporting allied research, instruction and service, promotion of international peace and harmony, and the advancement of greater humanity through Budo education. Though this organization applied to be recognized as an official organization with the Japanese government in 1953, granting of this status was rejected until 2012, as it was opposed by multiple organizations (such as the All Japan Kendo Federation, and the All Japan Judo Federation) which had inherited the original DNBK's duties and operations. While it is recognized by the government as an official brand new organization, similar to other organizations, it is no longer directly tied with any government office such as the ministry of sports or ministry of education, and therefore does not have the same access to the official training halls (Butokuden) like the original, and its current membership is in the few thousands. The first official branch outside Japan was established in Virginia (USA) and in 1985 a division in the east coast USA. In 1974, DNBK officially established the International Division overseeing all international members. In 2011, DNBK has official representatives and coordinators in Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Israel, Hungary, Russia, Germany, Spain, Malta, France and California USA, Hawaii USA, Mid-Western USA, Boston USA, Arizona USA, Florida USA, Australia, Romania, Switzerland, Armenia, Chile, Switzerland, Greece, Gibraltar, Austria, and Nepal.http://www.dnbk.org/ The official website of Dai Nippon Butoku Kai(DNBK)  References  Category:Empire of Japan Category:Japanese culture Category:Martial arts organizations Category:Japanese swordsmanship Kendo Category:Sports organizations established in 1895 Category:1895 establishments in Japan Category:Organizations disestablished in 1946 Category:Kendo organizations ","title":"Dai Nippon Butoku Kai"},{"id":"3797358","text":"Mabul () is a small island off the south-eastern coast of Sabah in Malaysia. The island has been a fishing village since the 1970s. In the 1990s, it first became popular to divers due to its proximity to Sipadan island. Located 15 km from Sipadan, this 20-hectare piece of land surfaces 2‚Äì3 metres above sea level, consists mostly flat grounds and aerial view is oval-shaped. Surrounding it are sandy beaches, perched on the northwest corner of a larger two-square-kilometre reef. Mabul island is administered as a part of Semporna, Tawau district.  Native settlements  There are two main villages on the island, \\"Kampung Mabul\\" and \\"Kampung Musu\\". The 1999 census recorded approximately 2,000 villagers living in Mabul, half of them children under 14 years old. The majority are immigrants from relatively nearby clusters of islands in the southern Philippines. These residents are mainly Bajau Laut and Suluk Muslims who live a nomadic lifestyle. Basic amenities include a mosque, schools, community and fishermen's hall. The main transportation mode between places is via boat. As most residents mainly work as fishermen, the village source of income depends on ocean-based products such as squid and fish. Traditional fishing methods are called \\"Payau\\" and \\"Sangkaliya\\". Mabul fishermen prefer catches close to the Malaysia‚ÄìPhilippine borders, perhaps due to the abundance of fish stocks. An average fishing trip will take 3 to 5 days out at sea. When the men return, their catches are sold at Semporna on the mainland. It was said that Mabul was owned by a man from Menampilik island. Back in the 1970s, he and the villagers planted coconuts on the island, in addition to fishing. In 1992, Sipadan Mabul Resort (SMART) purchased a part of land on the east of Mabul intended for tourism.  Diving Mabul  Mabul Island Mabul's reef is on the edge of the continental shelf and the seabed surrounding the reef slopes out to a depth of 25 to 30 m. There are several dive resorts operating on Mabul island. Mabul is arguably one of the richest single destinations for exotic small marine life anywhere in the world. Flamboyant cuttlefish, blue-ringed octopus, mimic octopus and bobtail squids are just a few of the numerous types of cephalopods to be found on Mabul's reef. Many types of gobies can be found including the spike-fin goby, black sail-fin goby and metallic shrimp goby. Frogfish are everywhere; giant, painted and clown frogfish are regularly seen along with most of the scorpion fish family.Sipadan, Mabul Kapali, - Sabah's underwater treasure, published by Natural History Publications. There are six resorts here providing accommodation for scuba divers‚Äîmost located on the island or on stilts over the water, while one is on a converted oil platform about 500 metres from the beach. There are also several homestay & backpacker accommodations which can arrange diving. All of the resorts/homestays can arrange a day trip to the nearby island of Pulau Sipadan. There is a permit system for Sipadan and all permits may be booked months in advance. Transportation Flights to Tawau Airport, the nearest airport to Mabul, from Kota Kinabalu take 55 minutes. From Kuala Lumpur a 2¬Ω-hour flight is required to get to Tawau. From there a bus, taxi or minivan can be arranged from Tawau's airport to Semporna, where boats ferry passengers from the jetty there to the island itself.

In some sources, Marius is called \\"Maris\\" and Audifax is placed last. (died 270) were, according to their largely legendary passio of the 6th century, four saints of the same family (a husband, his wife, and their two sons). They came from Persia to Rome, and were martyred in 270 for sympathizing with Christian martyrs and burying their bodies. Some ancient martyrologies place the date of their death between 268 and 270, during the reign of Claudius II, although there was no persecution of Christians during this time.Santi Mario, Marta, Abaco e Audiface Their story relates how the family's assistance to Christians exposed them to persecution. They were seized and delivered to the judge Muscianus or Marcianus, who, unable to persuade them to abjure their faith, condemned them to various tortures. Despite the torture, the saints refused to abjure. Marius and his two sons were thus beheaded on the Via Cornelia, and their bodies were burnt. Martha meanwhile was killed at a place called in Nimpha or Nymphae Catabassi (later called Santa Ninfa),Father Alban Butler: Saints Marius, Martha, Audifax, and Abachum thirteen miles from Rome. Tradition states that Martha was cast into a well. Veneration According to tradition, a Roman lady named Felicitas secured the half-consumed remains of the father and sons and also the mother's body from the well, and had the sacred relics secretly interred on her estate at Buxus, today Boccea. This is said to have occurred on January 20. A church arose at Boccea, and during the Middle Ages, it became a place of pilgrimage. The relics of the martyrs later suffered various vicissitudes: some were transferred to the churches of Sant'Adriano al Foro and Santa Prassede, in Rome, and part of these relics were sent to Eginhard, biographer of Charlemagne, who lodged them in the monastery of Seligenstadt. Some relics went to Pr√ºm Abbey where their presence was recorded in the early 11th century. The original reliquary chest was destroyed during the French occupation at the end of the 18th century. The current chest dates from the 19th century.

Its core concept lies in the collectivist notion that if individual members of a certain group with binding ideals ‚Äì such as a union, coalition, confederation or alliance ‚Äì work on their own instead of as a team, they are each doomed to fail and will all be defeated. The phrase is also often referred to with only the words \\"United we stand\\". Historical origin United States propaganda poster from World War II. The Seal of Kentucky, featuring the motto. The phrase has been attributed to the ancient Greek storyteller Aesop, both directly in his fable \\"The Four Oxen and the Lion\\"The Four Oxen and the Lion Bartleby's famous quotations and indirectly in \\"The Bundle of Sticks\\".The Bundle of Sticks Bartleby's famous quotations New Testament references A similar phrase also appears in the biblical New Testament ‚Äì translated into English from the historic Greek in Mark 3:25 as \\"And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand\\". Similar verses of the New Testament include Matthew 12:25 (\\"And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand\\") and Luke 11:17 (\\"But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.\\"). The 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica quotes Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253) saying \\"It is written that united we stand and divided we fall.\\" Use in U.S. history The first attributed use in modern times is to Founding Father John Dickinson in his pre-Revolutionary War song \\"The Liberty Song\\", first published on July 7, 1768 in both the Pennsylvania Journal and Pennsylvania Gazette newspapers. In the song Dickinson wrote: \\"Then join hand in hand, brave Americans all! By uniting we stand, by dividing we fall!\\". Kentucky entered the Union on June 1, 1792. A little over six months later, on December 20, 1792, the first Kentucky General Assembly adopted the official seal of the Commonwealth, including the state motto ‚Äî United We Stand, Divided We Fall. 'United We Stand' license plate designed by Troy Wingard for the South Carolina Department of Public Safety in 2002 Patrick Henry used the phrase in his last public speech, given in March 1799, in which he denounced The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. Clasping his hands and swaying unsteadily, Henry declaimed, \\"Let us trust God, and our better judgment to set us right hereafter. United we stand, divided we fall. Let us not split into factions which must destroy that union upon which our existence hangs.\\" At the end of his oration, Henry fell into the arms of bystanders and was carried, almost lifeless, into a nearby tavern. Two months afterward, he died. During his unsuccessful campaign against Stephen Douglas in 1858, Abraham Lincoln gave a speech centered on the House divided analogy to illustrate the need for a universal decision on slavery across all states. Since 1942, this phrase has been the official non-Latin state motto of Kentucky.The Kentucky official Latin motto, since 2002, is Deo gratiam habeamus (\\"Let us be grateful to God\\"). The U.S. state of Kentucky's first governor, Isaac Shelby, was particularly fond of the stanza from \\"The Liberty Song\\". On the Missouri flag, the phrase is also written around the center circle.

Bandholtz, President of the Day, October 5th, 1919.\\" The Romanian aim was to recover artefacts taken from the Library of the Romanian Academy during the Central Powers' occupation of Bucharest and from the Transylvanian museums (from a territory which was claimed by the Kingdom of Romania) by the retreating Austro-Hungarian troops. On 13 February 1920 Bandholtz was interviewed by the correspondent of \\"The New York Times\\" in Paris, during which he stated he stopped by himself the Romanian military from entering the Hungarian National Museum, and thus preventing a \\"gold treasure\\" from being stolen. However in his own memories \\"An Undiplomatic Diary by the American Member of the Inter- Allied Military Mission to Hungary, 1919-1920\\" he did not mention any gold treasure, only museum artefacts. At the protest of the Romanian authorities, Bandholtz retracted his statements from the interview, and the US Department of State sent a verbal note to the Romanian Legation in Washington, according to which the correspondent of \\"The New York Times\\" attributed statements to Bandholtz \\"gratuitously and without his approval\\". After returning to the US, Bandholtz commanded the 13th Infantry Brigade at Camp Funston in Kansas. This camp had been established for troops to be trained for World War I.Garfield (2009), A Forgotten Soldier, p. 158 In 1920, a rebellion among miners broke out in Mingo County, West Virginia after two mineworkers were assassinated on the McDowell County courthouse steps. President Warren G. Harding sent Gen. Bandholtz and Gen. Billy Mitchell to control the situation. Bandholtz threatened protesting mineworkers that they would be tried for treason. Mineworkers tried to compromise, saying that they would stop fighting if federal troops would come and enforce the law evenhandedly, but this was initially refused by Bandholtz. Eventually federal troops were deployed and mine workers quickly ceased fighting. Several treason trials were eventually held, at private expense, The prosecution failed to gain convictions and the trials of citizens outraged much of the larger US society.Blair Mountain Became A Battlefield Again , JCS group The 13th Brigade was deactivated in August 1921 and Bandholtz assumed duty as commanding general, Military District of Washington. On January 28, 1922, Bandholtz assisted in rescue operations at the collapse of the Knickerbocker Theatre during the noted Knickerbocker Storm. In the end, 98 people were killed and 133 were seriously injured. For his effort and handling of the situation, Bandholtz received a letter of commendation from the Secretary of War.Garfield (2009), A Forgotten Soldier, pp.173-174 Bandholtz retired from active service for disability on November 4, 1923 and was promoted to the rank of Major general. He received many awards during his military career, including the Cross of Commander Order of the Crown, Cross of Commander French Legion of Honor, and Croix de Guerre with Palm. He was also honored with other foreign awards, such as the Grand Cross Montenegro Silver Medal for Valor and the Romanian Grand Cross, Order of the Cross. The latter is the only award of this class given to an American.Garfield (2009), A Forgotten Soldier, pp. 180-181 Personal life Bandholtz and his wife May separated in 1918 after 28 years of marriage. They divorced in 1922.Garfield (2009), A Forgotten Soldier, p. 152 In April 1922, a few months after the divorce was made final, Bandholtz married Inez Claire Gorman in New York City. Gorman was twenty-five years younger than Bandholtz. The marriage caused tension between Bandholtz and his only son Cleveland. Also a career officer, he was by then serving as a colonel in the United States Army.Garfield (2009), A Forgotten Soldier, pp. 177‚Äì178 Bandholtz suffered from heart problems later in life. On May 7, 1925, he died at the age of 61.Garfield (2009), A Forgotten Soldier, p. 183 Bandholtz is buried in the Constantine Cemetery in Constantine, Michigan. Memorial in Budapest The statue of Major General Bandholtz (by Mikl√≥s Ligeti) in front of the US Embassy in Budapest, Hungary Plaque of Bandholtz statue In 1936, the Hungarian government commissioned a statue in Bandholtz's honor and placed it in Szabads√°g t√©r (Liberty Square) across from the US embassy in Budapest. It is inscribed with the following (a quote from him): The statue, made by prominent Hungarian sculptor Mikl√≥s Ligeti, depicts Bandholtz with his riding crop in one hand. According to the historical fact about his standoff with the Romanian military, he had persuaded them to stop looting the National Museum with nothing more than the crop and the force of his personality. The incident is described in detail in his book An Undiplomatic Diary by the American Member of the Inter-Allied Military Mission to Hungary, 1919-1920. Today the crop is on display in the Hungarian National Museum. Romanian representatives objected to the memorial. The protests of the Romanian authorities led the American embassy to adopt a more circumspect attitude, deciding that only American diplomats of lesser rank be present at the unveiling of the monument. After World War II, the statue was repaired. But in 1949, it was removed by the new Communist government that had come to power. In 1985, at the request of Ambassador Nicolas M. Salgo, the Hungarian government moved the work from a statue boneyard to the garden of the US Ambassador's residence. It was returned to its original place in the park in front of the US embassy on July 6, 1989, a day before President George H. W. Bush's historic visit to Budapest. The inscription was restored in 1993, a few years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Legacy His papers are held at the University of Michigan's Bentley Historical Library.

The First Line Reserve comprises former members of the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF) and the Second Line Reserve comprises the Army Reserve (AR) and Naval Service Reserve (NSR). The RDF was established on 1 October 2005 and replaced the Second Line Reserve, previously named An F√≥rsa Cosanta √Åiti√∫il (FC√Å) in the case of the AR, and An Slua Muir√≠ in the case of the NSR. The Reserve has undergone significant reorganisation and modernisation in tandem with the Permanent Defence Forces as part of the \\"Single Force\\" concept.  History and organisation  Chief of Staff visiting Army reservists on annual full-time training in the Glen of Imaal In 1997 a steering group was convened by the Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces to conduct a special study on the restructuring of the Defence Forces Reserve. The report was completed in May 1999. The Reserve Defence Forces was established on 1 October 2005 in line with the recommendations of this report, and as part of a wider restructure of the Defence Forces from 2000 onwards. An RDF Training Authority was established in the Defence Forces Training Centre (DFTC) which co-ordinates and conducts reserve training. The Minister for Defence accepted the recommendations of a \\"Value for Money (VFM) Review of the Reserve Defence Force\\", published on 20 November 2012. The Steering Committee recommended an Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve based on a total strength ceiling of 4,069 personnel, (3,869 personnel Army Reserve and 200 personnel Naval Service Reserve), subject to existing organisational structures being revised. In order to provide sufficient paid training days to sustain this strength, the Steering Committee recommended the withdrawal of gratuities from members of the Reserve and a re-allocation of the budgetary provision for gratuities of ‚Ç¨0.9 million to provide sufficient paid training days for members of the Reserve. The key points are; * A new \\"Single Force\\" concept will see Army units having Reserve sub-units attached, rather than separate stand-alone Reserve units. * A geographic spread for the Reserve will be achieved between existing Permanent Defence Force locations and the retention of 16 external locations. This consolidation into an effective organisation will entail the amalgamation and closure of units throughout the country. Recruitment is also envisaged where this is necessary to achieve the numbers required in particular locations. * The strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve was reduced from its previous establishment of 9,692 personnel to 4,069 personnel. This will be achieved through natural turnover. Implementation of the new organisational structures will require participation and flexibility from existing Reserve personnel. * The Naval Service Reserve will consist of 200 personnel and be based in four locations. * The number of Army personnel available to work full-time with the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve is being reduced from the current 261 Army personnel to 57 full-time Army personnel. Additional support will be provided from Army units. * Implementation of the re-organisation, including regulatory provision for the new Reserve organisation, will be progressed in tandem with the broader re-organisation of the Army. As with the Army, there will be an implementation process to achieve the transition from current structures to the new structures. In the intervening period, the military authorities will ensure the continuity of Reserve training. The representative body for all ranks of the RDF is the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association (RDFRA). Earlier reserve forces: LSF, LDF, FC√Å During The Emergency (Second World War), the civilian reserve was known as the Local Security Force, then as the Local Defence Force, which subsequently became translated into Irish as An F√≥rsa Cosanta √Åiti√∫l (or FC√Å). The FC√Å persisted as such until 2005 until reorganised and renamed as above. For a more detailed history, see main article. Current tasks Irish Army Reserve assessment training The roles of the Reserve are those assigned to the Defence Forces: * Defence against armed aggression * Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) * Participation in Peace Support Operations * Fishery Protection * Other duties which may be assigned by Government. Tasks are assigned to the Reserve to support the Defence Forces in fulfilling its roles. These include; * Augmentation/reinforcement of the PDF. * Provision of logistic support. * Provision of armed escorts. * Guard duty. * Augmentation of Naval Service on fishery protection patrols and overseas visits. * Port security, sighting reports, information-gathering. * Staffing of Military Posts during periods of PDF deployment. * Radiological Monitoring. * Ceremonial duties at national and local events. As well as to augment the Permanent Defence Forces in times of crisis or emergency, where Reservists are liable to be called up on permanent service within the state or outside it by the Minister for Defence or Government of Ireland in accordance with the Defence Acts. Naval Service Reserve personnel were deployed on naval vessels in order to assist in Ireland's response to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in early 2020, whereby naval vessels formed part of testing centres in support of the HSE. Future Personnel from the Reserve forces following completion of annual 10km An Cosant√≥ir road race in 2014, McKee Barracks The 2015 White Paper on Defence and the 2016 Programme for Government provide that the overall establishment of the Army Reserve (AR) and the Naval Service Reserve (NSR) be set at 4,169 personnel, consisting of 3,869 Army Reservists and the expansion of the establishment of the four Naval Service Reserve Units from 200 to 300 personnel. In 2016, recruitment campaigns and training were stepped up to meet these targets. Female personnel While the number of female personnel in the Permanent Defence Forces is at a low 6% (which recruitment is trying to increase), the number of female Reservists is higher, with 16.3% female personnel in the Army Reserve and 22% female personnel in the Naval Service Reserve. 'Specialist Reserve' and overseas deployments Prof Michael Mulqueen in his 2009 book titled Re-evaluating Irish National Security Policy: Affordable Threats? states \\"The emphasis on overseas service had also been extended to the Army Reserve. A reorganisation plan envisaged 2,600 of the State's 12,000 Reservists being offered training up to the level of full-time soldiers, in preparation for overseas service. Reservists would also conduct, on a routine basis, ATCP operations. This seemed to suggest that in time, while the permanent Army concentrated on overseas missions [...] part-time soldiers would take their place in duties defined broadly enough to encompass everything from flood relief to anti-terrorist patrols.\\" The White Paper on Defence published in 2015 by the Irish government sets out plans for a \\"Specialist Reserve\\" to be created within the Defence Forces, to augment professional skills that may not be readily available within the PDF, such as ICT, medical, ordnance, heavy vehicle mechanics and engineering professionals. The White Paper expects that personnel seconded to the Specialist Reserve could, subject to their availability, be integrated with their PDF counterparts and take part in live operations, including overseas missions, similar to other European reserve military forces. Popular culture Components of the Reserve Defence Forces (and previously the FC√Å) were involved as extras in the filming of the D-Day landing battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan ‚Äì as well as battle scenes in Braveheart, My Boy Jack and other feature films.

The Gazelle class was the culmination of earlier unprotected cruiser and aviso designs, combining the best aspects of both types in what became the progenitor of all future light cruisers of the Imperial fleet. Built to be able to serve with the main German fleet and as a colonial cruiser, she was armed with a battery of ten guns and a top speed of . Frauenlob was a modified version of the basic Gazelle design, with improved armor and additional coal storage for a longer cruising range. Following her commissioning in early 1903, Frauenlob served in the reconnaissance force for the main German fleet. During this period, she took part in routine training exercises, visits to foreign ports, and training cruises, including a trip to Spain in 1903. Her crew won prizes for excellent shooting among the fleet's cruisers in 1906 and 1907, the former being the first year the prize was awarded to cruisers. In January 1908, the ship was decommissioned and placed in reserve for the next six years. The ship was reactivated in August 1914 after the start of World War I, and she saw action at the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August, where she and the cruiser badly damaged the British cruiser . She took part in fleet operations for the next two years, culminating in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. There, she saw little action in the early stages of the battle, but in one of the chaotic night engagements as the Germans tried to disengage and return home, Frauenlob was hit by a torpedo launched by the cruiser , which caused the ship to capsize and sink with the vast majority of her crew. The wreck was discovered in 2000, and is in remarkably good condition, sitting upright on the ocean floor. Design Following the construction of the unprotected cruiser and the aviso for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), the Construction Department of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) prepared a design for a new small cruiser that combined the best attributes of both vessels. The designers had to design a small cruiser with armor protection that had an optimal combination of speed, armament, and stability, along with the endurance to operate on foreign stations in the German colonial empire. The resulting Gazelle design provided the basis for all of the light cruisers built by the German fleet to the last official designs prepared in 1914. After the first seven ships had been built or were under construction, the Construction Department improved the design slightly, strengthening the armor on the conning tower and increasing the beam, which allowed more space for coal storage, and thus a longer cruising radius. These changes were applied to the last three members of the class: Frauenlob, , and . Frauenlob was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two triple- expansion steam engines manufactured by AG Weser. They were designed to give , for a top speed of . The engines were powered by eight coal-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers. Frauenlob carried of coal, which gave her a range of at . She had a crew of 14 officers and 256 enlisted men. The ship was armed with ten SK L/40 guns in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with five torpedoes. They were submerged in the hull on the broadside. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick gun shields. History=Early career Frauenlob underway before the war Frauenlob was ordered under the contract name \\"G\\" and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in mid-1901. She was launched of 22 March 1902; owing to space limitations, she was launched sideways, rather than stern-first. Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Wilhelm B√ºchsel gave a speech at the launching ceremony, and the new ship was christened by Anna Reuss, Princess of Stolberg- Wernigerode. She was named for the schooner , launched in 1853, that had been paid for in part by the donations of women from the German lands; the name means \\"praise women.\\" The cruiser was commissioned for sea trials on 17 February 1903 under the command of Korvettenkapit√§n (KK‚ÄîCorvette Captain) Johannes Nickel. After a three-day endurance test passing through the Skagerrak, Kattegat, and the Danish straits, Frauenlob arrived in Kiel, where she was assigned to the reconnaissance force for I Squadron. She continued initial testing through 23 April, and on 7 May joined the fleet for a cruise to Spain that lasted until 10 June. A training cruise to Norwegian waters followed in July, and in September, the ship was drydocked in Wilhelmshaven for repairs and maintenance. She joined the fleet's battleships for their winter training cruise in November and December in the North and Baltic Seas. In January 1904, Frauenlob took part in another winter training cruise in the Skagerrak, and in March, the fleet's reconnaissance cruisers conducted a training cruise in the North Sea. The fleet held training exercises in May and June in the North and Baltic Seas, which concluded with a naval review held in honor of the visit of King Edward VII of Great Britain. The German fleet made a visit to Britain, the Netherlands, and Norway in July and August. After their return to Germany in August, the ships conducted fleet maneuvers. Another winter cruise followed in November and December, this time in the Baltic. The year 1905 followed a similar pattern to the previous year with regard to training exercises and cruises abroad. On 2 May, she ran aground while departing Bremerhaven, damaging her rudder. From 26 to 28 August, she took part in a cruise in the Baltic with the British Channel Fleet on its way to visit Swinem√ºnde. After the annual fleet maneuvers, she was drydocked in Wilhelmshaven for an overhaul, and in October, KK Robert Mischke took command of the ship. She was docked again in December to have her hull thoroughly inspected for damage that might have been incurred during the grounding. The year 1906 passed largely uneventfully for Frauenlob. She took part in a large naval review held in September after the end of the autumn fleet maneuvers; the review was held for Grossadmiral (Grand Admiral) Hans von Koester, who was retiring at the end of the year. Frauenlob won Kaiser Wilhelm II's Schiesspreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery during that year's maneuvers; up to this time, he had previously only awarded one to each of the fleet's battleship squadrons. During torpedo practice, she accidentally torpedoed and sank her own steam pinnace. In addition to the year's training activities, Frauenlob conducted a training cruise to familiarize navigation officers with the narrow waterways of the Danish straits in 1907. She also won the Schiesspreis for cruisers again that year. In October, KK Friedrich Boedicker replaced Mischke as the ship's captain. By 1908, she was the only member of her class still in active service, and on 19 January she, too, was decommissioned in Wilhelsmhaven. She spent the next six years in reserve, though beginning in mid-1912, she was thoroughly overhauled and four of her 10.4 cm guns were removed to install ten guns for training purposes, though she was not activated for this role. World War I Frauenlob steaming at speed Frauenlob was recommissioned into the fleet on 2 August 1914 as a result of the outbreak of World War I. She was initially assigned to III Scouting Group before being transferred to the newly-created IV Scouting Group on 25 August. When the British raided the German defensive patrols in the Helgoland Bight on 28 August, resulting in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, Frauenlob was anchored off Helgoland as distant support of the patrol line. The British raiders‚Äîthe Harwich Force‚Äîconsisted of two light cruisers and thirty-three destroyers under Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. Frauenlob received reports of the attack at 08:00 from returning picket boats. At about 09:00, Frauenlob and the light cruiser were sent out to reinforce the beleaguered German patrols. Frauenlob and Stettin shortly thereafter encountered the British cruiser and about six destroyers and they opened fire at 09:09. The ships quickly found the range and hit the British ship an estimated 25‚Äì35 times, disabling all but one of her guns and inflicting serious damage. One shell detonated a cordite charge and set Arethusa on fire. The ship's engine room flooded and her speed fell to . She turned away to starboard in order to escape from the punishing fire, but Frauenlob kept up with the badly damaged British cruiser until she disappeared in the fog. In return, Frauenlob was hit ten times, but was not seriously damaged; in all, five men were killed and another thirty-two were wounded. After the engagement ended, Frauenlob and the torpedo boat took the badly damaged minesweeper under tow and returned her to Heligoland, before proceeding to Wilhelmshaven. After completing repairs, Frauenlob joined the High Seas Fleet when it sailed in support of the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group during the raid on Yarmouth on 3‚Äì4 November. A similar operation followed on 15‚Äì16 December, resulting in the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. She also took part in fleet sorties in March, April, May, September, and October 1915; none of these resulted in contact with British warships. During the operation on 17‚Äì18 May, she steamed in front of the fleet to detonate any naval mines that might have been laid by British minelayers. In late October, she was drydocked for an overhaul, during which time her crew was sent to operate the cruiser . Frauenlob returned to service in time for another fleet operation on 23 March 1916 that resulted in no contact with enemy forces. =Battle of Jutland= alt=The German fleet sailed to the north and met the British fleet sailing from the west; both fleets conducted a series of turns and maneuvers during the chaotic battle. In late May, the German fleet commander, VAdm Reinhard Scheer, planned to conducted another fleet operation. The plan called for the battlecruiser squadron to steam north to the Skagerrak, with the intention of luring out a portion of the British fleet so it could be destroyed by Scheer's waiting battleships. The Germans had at their disposal sixteen dreadnought battleships, six pre-dreadnoughts, and five battlecruisers, along with numerous cruisers and torpedo boats. In the early hours of 30 May, the German fleet got underway Frauenlob remained with IV Scouting Group for the operation, which was at that time under the command of Kommodore (Commodore) Ludwig von Reuter and was tasked with screening the High Seas Fleet. Unknown to the Germans, the Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene and the two main battle fleets engaged. Frauenlob was not actively engaged in the battle until later on the evening of 31 May; at around 21:15, IV Scouting Group encountered the British 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron and briefly engaged them, but due to the poor visibility, only Stettin and fired for long, and to no effect. Later, during the chaotic night fighting, the battlecruisers and passed too closely in front of Stettin, which forced all of the ships of IV Scouting Group to fall out of line, inadvertently bringing them into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron. A ferocious firefight ensued, at a range of only . Frauenlob opened fire on and , as did the rest of IV Scouting Group. In return, Southampton launched a torpedo that struck Frauenlob at around 22:35, which cut her power and caused serious flooding. British shellfire set the deck alight, and the stricken cruiser quickly capsized and sank with heavy loss of life. John Campbell reports that twelve officers and 308 men were killed in the sinking, while Hans Hildebrand, Albert R√∂hr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz state that 324 died when Frauenlob sank. Both agree that only 9 men from her crew survived, having been picked up after the battle by a Dutch steamer and interned in the Netherlands for the rest of the war. Wreck Bell of Frauenlob In 2000, the wreck was located by Danish divers. The British marine archaeologist Innes McCartney led a subsequent dive and confirmed that the wreck sits upright on the sea floor and is largely intact. Skeletal remains from the ship's crew are scattered around the sunken cruiser. The wreck was positively identified when McCartney's team recovered the ship's bell in 2001, which they donated to the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel, where the bell is currently on display.

Miss Brodie is a highly idealistic character with an exaggerated romantic view of the world; many of her catchphrases have become clich√©s in the English language. The character takes her name from the historical Jean Brodie (aka Jean Watt), common law wife or mistress of Willie Brodie, whom the fictional Miss Brodie claims as a direct descendant; thus, she is the fictional namesake of the real Jean Brodie. The real Deacon Willie Brodie was indeed a cabinetmaker and fashioner of gibbets. Deacon Brodie was a deacon of the Kirk o' Scotland; he did rob the Excise Office; and he was executed on a gibbet that he may indeed have designed himself. Likewise, Deacon Brodie's fictional descendant though much more human and likeable may be described as ending up hoisted by her own petard. The story of William and Jean Watt Brodie was preserved for posterity in the play Deacon Brodie, or The Double Life‚ÄîA Melodrama in Five Acts and Eight Tableaux by W. E. Henley and Robert Louis Stevenson. The play opened at the Prince's Theatre in London on 2 July 1984, with Mr. E. J. Henley as Deacon William Brodie and Miss Minnie Bell as Jean. Mr. Henley reprised his performance at Montreal on 26 September 1987, this time with Miss Carrie Coote in the role of Jean Watt/Brodie.  Character  Miss Brodie with Mr. Lowther and the Brodie set in Jay Presson Allen's stage adaptation of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie In the novel, Miss Jean Brodie is a school teacher at Marcia Blaine, a conservative girls' school in 1930s Edinburgh, Scotland. She is a charismatic spinster who appears to be out of place in her surroundings. In 1930, she declares that her prime has begun and sets out to make sure her class gets the full benefit of her Prime by making sure they are aware of drama, art and fascist beliefs. Out of her class she selects her favourite girls and attempts to mould them into the cr√®me de la cr√®me. In the novel, these are Sandy, Monica, Jenny, Eunice, Rose, and Mary MacGregor. There is also a tomboy, Joyce Emily, who attempts to force her way into the Brodie set, but she is summarily dismissed by Miss Brodie. Sandy eventually becomes a cloistered nun, Sister Helena; Mary MacGregor is killed in a hotel fire; and Joyce Emily enlists in the Spanish Civil War, where she is killed. The other teachers and the headmistress, Miss Mackay, bemoan the fact that Miss Brodie's \\"special girls\\" are different from the rest, displaying none of the team spirit the school tries to encourage. Years after Sandy and the others have moved on to the Senior School (where Miss Brodie does not teach) and into the world, Miss Mackay has an appointment with Sandy in which she bemoans the fact that \\"it's still going on\\", that is, that Miss Brodie is training up another round of young girls who will come to think they are better than the other girls. Sandy then betrays Miss Brodie by telling Miss Mackay of her penchant for fascist political indoctrination (previously, Miss Mackay had tried and failed to get rid of Miss Brodie by catching her in some kind of sex scandal) which, at a school like this one, will not be tolerated by the parents. She is easily gotten rid of, and suspects that it was Mary who betrayed her, even though it was Sandy. In the novel, Miss Brodie dies of cancer in 1946. The play and film show marked departures from the novel. As adapted for stage and screen by Jay Presson Allen, the story is told in a largely linear fashion. It begins in 1932, after Miss Brodie has returned from her summer holidays in Italy, having realised her prime is upon her. The essentials of the character and the story are the same, though some characters are different and/or meet different ends. Mary MacGregor, for example, does not die in a hotel fire that happens years after graduation but she is killed while in her final year at Marcia Blaine, when she goes to join her brother who is fighting in the Spanish Civil War. She dies when the train in which she is travelling is blown up. In the play we see a few scenes showing Sandy in later life as a nun. In the film we do not know what becomes of Sandy or any of the other girls after graduation, because that is where it ends. Whereas in the book Miss Brodie is betrayed by Sandy after she and the girls have all left school and gone out into the world, the play and film put the betrayal before graduation, some weeks before the end of the school year in 1936. Sandy does it in reaction to the death of Mary MacGregor.  Calvinism  Medal of John Calvin, with the Divine Hand holding a heart Most literary critics agree that Miss Brodie was written as a representation of \\"the God of John Calvin\\", and there are indeed many similarities between her and the Calvinist portrayal of God. In the story, she selects a handful of girls from her class to become \\"her girls\\". The girls are not chosen for any particular reason but simply because they are \\"her favourites.\\" This is strikingly similar to the Calvinist teaching of Unconditional election (Elects) which teaches God chooses His Elect to go to Heaven, based on His own will rather than any reflection of the person's character. Indeed, Miss Brodie attempts to transform these girls into the cr√®me de la cr√®me, again similar to the Calvinist teaching that the Elect will mold into God's image. The most striking similarity however is the way Miss Brodie attempts to predestine the lives of her girls and those around her. She is determined that one of her girls becomes the lover of the school's art master as her proxy and seeks to make this happen. Another incident involves her encouraging a girl in her class to run to Spain and fight for the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, resulting in her death from bombing of her train. This compares with the Calvinist teaching of Predestination, that God has already set out a path for everybody. One of her girls, Sandy Stranger notices this similarity saying: > She thinks she is Providence ... She thinks she is the God of Calvin, the > beginning and the End. Ultimately, Miss Brodie's attempts to be the Calvinist God drive Sandy to the Roman Catholic Church. This is similar to Muriel Spark's own experience of converting to Roman Catholicism after growing up in Calvinist dominated Edinburgh. In the climactic scene of the film, Miss Brodie confronts Sandy and is pointedly told that she is \\"not good for people, and children should not be exposed to you.\\" Realizing she has no hope of appealing her dismissal from Marcia Blaine (the name of the school), Miss Brodie can do nothing but call the words after Sandy as she walks away, \\"Assassin! ASSASSIN!!!\\" Miss Brodie states she will be Transported to Australia for radicalism. The film closes poignantly with a shot of Sandy tearfully walking along after graduation, as we hear a voice-over of Miss Brodie saying, \\"Little girls, I am in the business of putting old heads on young shoulders, and all my pupils are the creme de la creme. Give me a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life!\\"  Fascism  Miss Brodie is described as a \\"born fascist\\" by one of her girls. An active teacher while fascism was gaining popularity in Europe, she openly admires Benito Mussolini and praises him to her class. She frequently tours Italy returning inspired by what she sees as Utopia. When Adolf Hitler becomes Chancellor of Germany, she changes her holiday destination to Berlin, believing Hitler's brownshirts to be more organised than Mussolini's blackshirts. When Sandy meets her for tea in the Braid Hills Hotel in 1946, Miss Brodie concedes that \\"Hitler was rather naughty\\". Her advocation for fascism is put into direct action when she persuades a troublesome girl to fight for Francisco Franco, which leads to tragedy.  Reference in later works  The character Domenica Macdonald in the 44 Scotland Street series by Alexander McCall Smith, taking place in contemporary Edinburgh, is compared to Jean Brodie by another character in the book itself (though sharing none of Brodie's attraction to fascism) and the comparison was taken up by critics. McCall Smith also cites the book as one of his favourite humorous books.Alexander McCall Smith's Top 10 favourite humorous books in The Guardian  Notes  Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional people from Edinburgh Category:Fictional schoolteachers ","title":"Jean Brodie"},{"id":"3797590","text":"\\"Obsoletely Fabulous\\" is the fourteenth episode in the fourth season of the American animated television series Futurama. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on July 27, 2003. Set in a retro-futuristic 31st century, the series follows the adventures of the employees of Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company. In this episode, Mom's Friendly Robot Company introduces a new model of robot, so older models, including Bender, are required to get a system upgrade. Plot At a robot expo, Mom's Friendly Robot Company introduces a new robot: Robot 1-X. Professor Farnsworth buys one to help out around the office. Feeling obsolete after witnessing 1-X outperform him at every assigned task, Bender decides to get an upgrade so he can be compatible with Robot 1-X. After witnessing another robot display a complete personality change after receiving the upgrade, Bender begins to have second thoughts, and mid-upgrade he changes his mind and leaps out the window. Too scared to get the upgrade but unable to face the others without it, he heads out to sea, only to wash up on an uncharted island. Bender finds four outdated robots living on the island and befriends them. The outdated robots gradually convert Bender to their rejection of technology, and he orders them to \\"downgrade\\" his metal robotics to a wooden body. Bender leads his friends to New New York, where they wage war on technology. The band of five destroy most technology in the city, including Mom's factory, and head to Planet Express to destroy Robot 1-X. After destroying the power lines, Bender breaks into the hangar, where he confronts his former crew. Bender has his robotic friends throw boulders at Robot 1-X, but they miss and hit the Planet Express ship, which falls and pins the crew down to the floor. A candle falls onto the leaking fuel from the ship, forming a ring of fire around the crew. Bender tries to use the extinguisher, but his wooden body collapses from termite damage and catches fire. Bender resorts to asking Robot 1-X to save the crew. Once 1-X saves them, Bender is overcome with feelings of gratitude and friendship for 1-X. It is then revealed that Bender never left the upgrade factory in the first place, and his experience on the island and everything after was an illusion triggered by the upgrade process. Amazed at how real the vision was, Bender begins wondering if life itself is just the product of his or someone else's imagination, but comes to the conclusion that \\"Reality is what you make of it,\\" and walks off into a fantasy world with unicorns and cigar-lighting fairies.  Production  A scene during the robot upgrade was cut featuring Mom brainwashing the robots. There was also an extra scene at the convention cut. Regular voice actor John DiMaggio did Bender's dialogue in the scene where he dances to \\"I'm Alright\\" by Kenny Loggins before the crew had the song available. The music for the scene when the obsolete robots rampage the city was written by Christopher Tyng and not licensed. The sound effect for Bender's arms falling off was meant to be temporary but it was kept because it was funnier than any of the later attempts at the sounds.

Built at the beginning of the 20th century in the Kneehill Creek Valley, Carbon is a village with paved, quiet streets lined with trees.  History  The Carbon district has a very colorful and interesting history. Ranching, farming and coal mining were the major activities of the early settlers. The name Carbon was suggested by L.D. Elliot, an area rancher, and was adopted for the new post office opened on October 1, 1904. The village was incorporated in 1912. Carbon had a railroad running through it which has since been removed. This railroad is on the south side of the Kneehill Creek. On both sides of the village (west/east) you can still see this railroad flying over (2016). This railroad was operated by CP rail. Glenbow museum in Calgary has photos of this railroad under construction on file. This railroad was primarily used to support the coal mining in the area.

She was best known for her work Angel of the Waters (1873), also known as Bethesda Fountain, located on the Bethesda Terrace in Central Park, New York.  Biography = Early Life  Stebbins was born on September 1, 1815 in New York City. She was the daughter of a wealthy banker, John L. Stebbins and Mary Largin. She was one of nine children and her family encouraged her interest in the arts.  Life in Rome  In 1856, Stebbins‚Äô brother, Henry G. Stebbins, encouraged her to travel to Rome to pursue sculpting. That May, Stebbins, her younger sister Caroline, and their mother traveled to Rome, where Emma and Caroline settled. While Caroline married John Rollin Tilton, an American painter, in 1858, Emma was welcomed into a society of expatriates by Harriet Hosmer, also an American sculptor. Hosmer introduced Stebbins to some of her future teachers including John Gibson and Paul Akers. One of the leading ladies of the expatriates in Rome was Charlotte Cushman, an American actress. Upon meeting Stebbins, Cushman took a special interest in both her work and in her affections. The pair quickly became a couple and within a year of meeting, the women exchanged unofficial vows and considered themselves married. As she had done for others before, Cushman used her influence to help secure commissions for Stebbins. Stebbins and Cushman‚Äôs romance strained their relationship with Hosmer, who had once been the object of Cushman‚Äôs affections and influence. In September 1857, Stebbins and Charlotte returned the States so Cushman could recoup her savings, after her business manager embezzled funds. During Cushman‚Äôs acting tour, Stebbins stayed with her family in New York. On July 6, Cushman gave her final performance and the couple sailed to England. Before returning to Rome in November 1858, the couple took a tour of the continent.257x257px  Later Years  Stebbins and Cushman lived together for 12 years before returning to the United States after Cushman was diagnosed with breast cancer. Stebbins had stopped working in order to care for Cushman, until her death in 1876. Stebbins spent nearly the rest of her life writing Cushman‚Äôs biography, Charlotte Cushman: Her Letters and Memories of Her Life, and died on October 25, 1882 from lung disease. She was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Works Stebbins was a neoclassical sculptor and made about two dozen small-scale marble statues and two public works in bronze. Unlike the majority of her peers, Stebbins enjoyed making smaller pieces and liked to do all of her carving herself. In 1842, some of Stebbins‚Äô work was featured at the National Academy of Design in New York. She was also nominated to be an associate member of the group, which was open to amateurs. However, Stebbins‚Äô election was nullified after an unspecified breach in procedure. Her name was never resubmitted. In 1847, Stebbins‚Äô submitted oil copies to be displayed at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. While Stebbins lived in Rome, she completed a number of statues including The Lotus Eater (1857-60), which was commissioned by British sculptor John Gibson, and Industry (1859) and Commerce (1859), which were both commissioned by Charles Heckscher. Industry and Commerce were both displayed at the Goupil & Cie gallery in New York in 1860. In 1860, Stebbins also completed a bust of Cushman, her lifelong partner. Later in life, the bust was a popular request for replication. Through the 1860s, Stebbins completed The Treaty of Henry Hudson with the Indians (1860), Sandalphon (1861), Satan (1862), and Christopher Columbus (1867). Christopher Columbus was the only life-sized marble piece that Stebbins created.  Horace Mann (1865)  Towards the end of 1861, Stebbins had been commissioned to complete a bronze statue of Horace Mann. The piece was to be erected in front of the State House in Boston. Cushman, a native to Boston, had a special interest in the project and is thought to have used her connections to get Stebbins the commission.  Angel of the Waters (1873)  Stebbins is best known for Angel of the Waters, which sits atop of Bethesda Fountain. Rumors of nepotism surrounded the project because Stebbins‚Äô brother was the chairman of Central Park‚Äôs Committee on Statuary, Fountains and Architectural Structure. Many believe that he pressured the committee into giving his sister the commission. Stebbins was inspired by the biblical story in which an angel gives the waters of Bethesda healing powers; it is in reference to the Croton Aqueduct, which brought fresh water to the city beginning in 1842. Legacy Angel of the Waters (1873) Much of what we know about Stebbins comes from her sister, Mary Stebbins Garland. After Stebbins‚Äô death, Garland documented his sister‚Äôs work in a scrapbook and wrote an unpublished biography, Notes on the Art Life of Emma Stebbins. The scrapbook contained several photos of Stebbins‚Äô work in chronological order, as well as pictures of Stebbins and those who had encouraged her, such as Cushman and Stebbins‚Äô brother Henry. Angel of the Waters has been featured in many New York movies, such as Elf and Enchanted. In June 2019, The New York Times wrote an obituary for Stebbins as part of their Overlooked series. Stebbins‚Äô obituary was added as a member of the LGBTQ community.

The school is centred upon a mansion house set in of parkland, at Bridge of Earn, south of Perth and less than an hour's drive from Edinburgh. It is the only Catholic boarding secondary school in Scotland and is located within the Diocese of Dunkeld. The school has links with the boys' school Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh and occasionally co-organises socials and functions together. Kilgraston has thriving music and arts departments, hockey, tennis and swimming academies, and is Scotland's only school with an on-site equestrian centre. In 2013 Kilgraston was ranked fourth in the top Scottish schools by Advanced Highers.Best Scottish Schools by Advanced Highers Most recently in 2015, Kilgraston was named as the Sunday Times top performing independent school for Highers and Advanced Highers 2015. Junior Years (ages 5‚Äì12), Senior School (ages 13‚Äì16) and Sixth Form. It is a member of the Girls' Schools Association.  History = Building  Kilgraston's earliest records date back to the 13th century where it was called Gilgryston. John Grant, the eldest son of Patrick Grant of Glenlochy, in Strath Spey, Inverness-shire, and whose principal wealth was made in Jamaica, was for several years a member of the Assembly there, becoming an assistant Judge of Jamaica's Supreme Court, and eventually succeeded Thomas French as Chief Justice of that island in January 1783, which office he held until 1790. Also, in 1783, he was confirmed as an armiger by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. Grant purchased, towards the end of the 18th century, from the Murray and Craigie families, the contiguous estates of Kilgraston and Pitcaithly, situated in the east end of the beautiful and rich valley of Strath Earn, and extending over part of the Ochil Hills. He died issueless at Edinburgh on 29 March 1793, and is buried under a marble tablet in St Cuthbert's Churchyard. He was succeeded in his estates by his brother Francis (d. 1819, who built the mansion. The mansion was used as a private home until World War I during which it was used as a hospital.  School  In 1930 the house and grounds were purchased by the Society of the Sacred Heart and opened as a school with 40 boarders. The Society ran the school as a charitable trust until 2000 when it became an independent school.History It briefly participated in the Assisted Places Scheme during the 1990s until its abolishment. In 2003, it absorbed the nearby all-girls Butterstone Prep School due to the latter's financial difficulties. Its girls were transferred 22 miles to Kilgraston and one of the boarding houses was named Butterstone after the school. Capital investments have included the opening of a 25m indoor swimming pool complex and upgrades to the equestrian centre (Kilgraston is the only school in Scotland with equestrian facilities on campus) including a 60m x 40m floodlit arena) and a new international sized all-weather floodlit hockey pitch. Other developments have been a new theatre with retractable seating for 150, a bistro style dining room, sports pavilion as well as an ongoing upgrade of the residential facilities. As a member of the Network of Sacred Heart Schools, there are exchange and twinning programmes available for girls to interact with fellow students from sister schools around the world. Sixth Form pupils now have access to their own study centre with individual work stations. In 2014, Professor Yellowlees, Chair of the Royal Society of Chemistry and Vice President and Head of the School of Science and Engineering at Edinburgh University, formally opened Kilgraston's ¬£1million Science Centre. In January 2012, Kilgraston was named \\"Independent School of the Year\\" ahead of 27 other independent schools across Britain at the Independent School Awards. It was also nominated for the Outstanding Strategic Initiative Award in recognition of the changes the school has made to achieve 55% growth in the last five years and received the Outstanding Financial Initiative prize for its ¬£2m investment in facilities and the introduction of a number of Sports Academies.  Academics  Kilgraston has a strong academic record in examination league tables. The school was recently named the top performing independent school for Advanced Highers (AH) 2016 by best-schools. In 2015, the school was Sunday Times top performing independent school for Highers (H) and Advanced Highers (AH) 2015. In August 2016, 65.5% of grades at AH were A grades against a national average of 33.5%. 90.5% of grades were A-B against a national average of 59.3% and 36% of girls are now studying a STEM undergraduate course. 100% of girls in 2016 were accepted into their choice of university.  Boarding  Boarding is available to girls aged 8 and above. Approximately half of pupils are boarders, most of whom board on weekdays or on flexible arrangements. The girls reside in three boarding houses: Butterstone (Junior Years), Mater (Senior School)Senior School Boarding and Barat or Swinton (Sixth Form).Sixth Form Boarding Senior School and Sixth Form boarders have their own bedrooms.

The first version aired on the DuMont Television Network from March to June 1953. The second version aired on ABC from September 1953 to May 1954. DuMont version The original version, broadcast live on the DuMont Television Network Saturday evenings for 30 minutes, from March 21 to June 13, 1953, starred Vaughn Taylor as an elderly janitor, Ernest P. Duckweather, cleaning-up after midnight in a TV studio. Tinkering with a TV set, he somehow made contact with the planet Jupiter, and two of its inhabitants, Johnny Jupiter and his colleague B-12, both of whom were hand puppets voiced by series writer Jerome Coopersmith and Carl Harms. The often sharp humor of the series was based on Duckweather trying to explain and justify earth customs to the natives of Jupiter, who could view them on their own TV sets. As an example, the program covered the US fad for 3-D movies, which came and went rapidly in 1953. The Jovian natives explain that their own movies were originally in 3-D but rapidly evolved to 7-D before dropping to 1-D, which is the format all Jovians prefer today. Episode status Very few kinescopes of the DuMont version of Johnny Jupiter have survived. ABC version Another weekly 30-minute version of the series, filmed and sponsored by M&M;'s Candies, appeared on ABC from September 5, 1953, to May 29, 1954. The concept was completely different from the DuMont version of the series. Wright King, as Duckweather, was now an eager young employee of a TV repair shop; most of each episode consisted of live-action situation comedy involving Duckweather, his boss Horatio Frisby, the boss's daughter Katherine, and one or more guest-stars. The puppets appeared only when Duckweather needed help or advice; the magic TV set now brought in three Jovian hand puppets: Johnny Jupiter; a cube-headed robot, Major Domo; and a cylinder-headed, glasses-wearing Reject the Robot, all voiced by Gil Mack. On at least one episode Reject's brother Defect appeared (Except for Johnny, the natives of Jupiter were apparently now all robots). The solution to Duckweather's problem generally involved beaming the bumbling Reject to earth, where he was played by new puppeteer Gene (aka Phil) London wearing a large prop robot suit. Apart from the robot suit, the new series was not geared towards children. The series was canceled after one 39-episode season. In this second series, Jerry Coopersmith was producer and script editor only. Episode status Copies of the ABC version of the program have survived and have been released on DVD.

The original mosque on the site was constructed between 1463 and 1470 on the site of the Church of the Holy Apostles. It was seriously damaged in the 1766 earthquake and was rebuilt in 1771 to a different design. It is one of the largest examples of Ottoman- Islamic architecture in Istanbul and represents an important stage in the development of classic Ottoman architecture. It is named after Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, known in Turkish as Fatih Sultan Mehmed, the Ottoman sultan who conquered Constantinople in 1453. Sahn-ƒ± Seman Medrese, a main center for the study of various traditional Islamic sciences such as theology, law, medicine, astronomy, physics and mathematics, was part of the Fatih Mosque and was founded by the Persian astronomer Ali Qushji who was invited by Mehmed to his court in Istanbul. History The Fatih mosque complex was a religious and social building of unprecedented size and complexity built in Istanbul between 1463-1470 by the order of Fatih Sultan Mehmed.Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire, G√°bor √Ågoston,Bruce Alan Masters, page 216 The mosque was built on the site of the former Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles, which had been in poor condition since the Fourth Crusade, and was demolished in order for the Fatih mosque to be constructed. The Church was the burial place of the Roman Emperor Constantine ‚Äî prior to the construction of the mosque, Constantine's sarcophagus was placed in the center of 12 sarchophagi representing the 12 apostles, in \\"the symbolic place of Christ. It was built by the Greek architect Atik Sinan.Van Millingen, Alexander (1912). Byzantine Churches of Constantinople. London: MacMillan & Co., p. 276. The Fatih mosque was the first monumental project in the Ottoman imperial architectural tradition. Aerial view of the Fatih Mosque and the surrounding K√ºlliye. The original complex included a set of well-planned buildings constructed around the mosque. They include eight medrese, library, hospital, hospice, caravanserai, market, hamam, primary school and public kitchen (imaret) which served food to the poor. Various t√ºrbe were added at a later dates. The original complex covered an almost square area on a side, extending along the Golden Horn side of Fevzipasa Street. The original mosque was badly damaged in the 1509 earthquake, after that it was repaired, but was then damaged again by earthquakes in 1557 and 1754 and repaired yet again. It was then completely destroyed by an earthquake on 22 May 1766 when the main dome collapsed and the walls were irreparably damaged. The current mosque (designed on a completely different plan) was completed in 1771 under Sultan Mustafa III by the architect, Mimar Mehmet Tahir. Architecture=Exterior Appearance of the Fatih Mosque before the earthquake, painted in 1559. The first Fatih mosque had one central dome supported by a single semi-dome of the same diameter on the qibla side and suspended on four arches, its dome was 26 meter in diameter. The second mosque which was built (1771) by Sultan Mustafa III after the 1766 earthquake, was built on a square plan. It has one central dome supported by four semi-domes. The courtyard, main entrance portal and lower portions of the minarets remain from the original construction, with the remainder consisting of the 1771 Baroque reconstruction. The Fatih Mosque Dome The Fatih Mosque Dome Outside Interior The present interior of the Fatih Mosque is essentially a copy of earlier designs invented by Sinan re-used repeatedly by himself and his successors throughout Istanbul (this technique is emulative of the Hagia Sophia). The 26 meter diameter center dome is supported by four semi-domes on each axis supported by four large marble columns. There are two minarets each with twin galleries. The calligraphy within the mosque and the mimbar exhibit a Baroque influence, but the white tiles of inferior quality are a poor comparison with the ƒ∞znik tiled splendor of mosques such as the R√ºstem Pasha Mosque. The mihrab dates from the original construction. Complex As with other imperial mosques in Istanbul, the Fatih Mosque was designed as a kulliye, or complex with adjacent structures to service both religious and cultural needs. To the north and south of the mosque are the Sahn-ƒ± Seman, eight great medrese, four to each side. These buildings are symmetrical, and each contains 18 cells for students (each housing four youths) and a dershane. Behind each was an annex, about half as large as the medrese itself, all of which have been destroyed as a result of road construction. The medreses provided for about a thousand students, making it a large university for its time. Historical photo taken between 1888-1910 The Hospice (taphane) is outside the southeast corner of the mosque precincts. The building has a beautiful courtyard supported by 16 exceptional columns of verd antique and granite, which were probably salvaged from the Church of the Holy Apostles. Opposite the hospice is the large t√ºrbe of Sultan Mahmud II's mother, Naksh-i Dil Sultana. In the graveyard on the kiblah side behind the mosque are the t√ºrbe of Sultan Mehmet II and his wife Gulbahar Hatun. Both were reconstructed after the earthquake. The t√ºrbe of the Conqueror is very baroque with a lavishly decorated interior. The t√ºrbe of Gulbahar is simple, with classic lines, and may closely resemble the original. In addition, the graveyard has a large number of graves belonging to leading state officials, including Osman Nuri Pasha. The distinguished Ottoman scholar and university professor Halil ƒ∞nalcƒ±k was buried here in 2016. On the kiblah side of the mosque, connected to it, is a domed library which was built in 1724. One of its doors opens onto the street, while the two other open onto the inner courtyard of the mosque. The library is undergoing repairs, and the books are under protection at the Suleymaniye Library. The caravanserai in the complex was repaired in the 1980s and combined with new shops to begin functioning as a workplace. The hospital, market, kitchens and hammam belonging to the original complex no longer exist.

He was Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge and the translator of Martial's epigrams and among the \\"First Westminster Company\\" charged by James I of England with the translation of the first 12 books of the King James Version of the Bible. He was also known for his intemperance and his doctrinal belief in Arminianism. Life Commonly called \\"Dutch Thomson\\", he was born in Holland of English parents, and received his education at Clare Hall, where he graduated B.A. in 1587 and was elected fellow. He commenced M.A. in 1591, and was incorporated in that degree at Oxford on 1 July 1596. Bishop Lancelot Andrewes presented him to the rectory of Snailwell, Cambridgeshire. He was selected as one of the translators of the Bible, being one of the company to which the task was allotted of translating the Old Testament from Genesis to the second book of Kings inclusive. Thomas Farnaby states that Thomson lived for some time under the protection of Sir Robert Killigrew, and that he was a great interpreter of Martial. Henry Hickman styles him ‚Äòthe grand propagator of Arminianism,‚Äô and Prynne describes him as ‚Äòa debosh'd drunken English Dutchman, who seldom went one night to bed sober;‚Äô but on the other hand Richard Montagu, who knew him well, says that he was ‚Äòa most admirable philologer,‚Äô and that ‚Äòhe was better known in Italy, France, and Germany than at home.‚Äô He was buried at St. Edward's, Cambridge, on 8 January 1613.

Dale Kinkade (1933‚Äì2004) was a linguist known especially for his work on Salishan languages. Born July 18, 1933, in Hartline, Washington, he graduated from Peshastin High School in 1950. He received his B.A. from the University of Washington in 1955 and his M.A. in 1957. He then moved to Indiana University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1963. After serving for three years in the United States Army, he taught at Washington State College from 1961 to 1964, and the University of Kansas from 1964 to 1973 before moving to the University of British Columbia where he remained until his retirement in 1998 as Distinguished Professor of Linguistics. Kinkade served for many years as a trustee of the Jacobs Fund of the Whatcom Museum Foundation, which supports fieldwork on Pacific Northwest languages and cultures and was one of the founders of the annual International Conference on Salishan and Neighboring Languages in 1966. He continued to work after his retirement; his last major work was his Cowlitz dictionary and grammatical sketch published in 2004. Kinkade was known for his insightful and in-depth research on all aspects of Salishan languages. Between 1960 and 1976 he conducted extensive fieldwork on several severely endangered languages. His own fieldwork together with his mastery of the literature made him the undisputed dean of Salishan linguistics. His contributions include dictionaries of three Salishan languages: Moses Columbia (1981), Upper Chehalis (1991), and Cowlitz (2004); over one hundred papers; several contributions to the Handbook of North American Indians (Volumes 7, 12, and 17); and several encyclopaedia and other general articles. As befits a specialist in a group of languages renowned for their phonetic difficulty Kinkade had a reputation as a master practical phonetician. Kinkade had a great, though dry, sense of humor and was generous with his time and extensive knowledge. He had a deep interest in classical music, especially opera, and was a strong supporter of the Seattle Opera. He was also an avid baseball fan and sometimes combined this interest with opera by listening to an opera while watching a baseball game.Davis, Henry, Donna Gerdts, and William Seaburg (2004) Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas. pp. 1-2 Although he lived and worked in Canada for more than 30 years he never became a Canadian citizen.

The core premise behind SA is to give users the ability to spread payments over several years, while offering \\"free\\" upgrades to newer versions during that time period.  Overview  Microsoft differentiates License and Software Assurance. Customers may purchase (depending on the program), a license without Software Assurance, Software Assurance only (but only to be used in combination with an existing license), both a License and Software Assurance together. The three possibilities are not always available, depending on the program (single license or volume license).  Features  The full list of benefits, effective March 2006, are as follows: * Free upgrades: Subscribers may upgrade to newer versions of their Microsoft software * Access to exclusive software products: Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs, Windows Vista Enterprise Edition, Windows 7 Enterprise Edition, Windows 8 Enterprise Edition and Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack are only available to Software Assurance customers * Training: Free training from Microsoft and access to Microsoft E-Learning, a series of interactive online training tools for users. This training can only be taken at a Microsoft Certified Partner for Learning Solutions and can only be redeemed for training that is categorized as Microsoft Official Curriculum. * Home use: Employees of a company with SA can use an additional copy of Microsoft software * Access to source code for larger companies (1,500+ desktops) * 24x7 telephone and web support * Additional error reporting tools * Free licenses for additional servers provisioned as \\"Cold backups\\" of live servers * Access to Microsoft TechNet managed newsgroups * Access to Microsoft TechNet downloads for 1 user * Extended Hotfix support: Typically Microsoft charges for non-security hotfixes after mainstream support for the product has ended (e.g. 5 years for Windows); this charge is waived for SA customers whose contracts started before 1 July 2017. As of 1 July 2017, Extended Hotfix support is no longer available through Software Assurance. All benefits are generated by a Benefits Administrator at the customer organization and can be managed on the Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center.  Criticism  Software Assurance is often criticized for its expense and the lack of \\"free\\" software upgrades within the contract period. The development period between major operating system versions often exceeds three years, requiring customers to renew their software assurance for another contract period, in order to get the next upgrade for \\"free\\".  History  Software Assurance was part of Licensing 6.0 and initially only provided upgrades, but around the time of the Microsoft Office 2003 release, more benefits were added. In March 2006, Microsoft added Windows Vista Enterprise Edition and Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs. In June 2011 Microsoft added Windows Thin PC, a desktop virtualization application that allows locked down versions of Windows 7 to run on older hardware.

It is accessed by a turnout at a short distance from Muƒüla-ƒ∞zmir highway just before entering Muƒüla. The town is located along slopes in the southern end of a plain of the same name. Etymology The township's official name was Pisik√∂y until 1961 and this name's short form Pisi is still commonly used to refer to the settlement and its plain across the region. As such, the town had retained its historical name until recently, the name change decided by the central government in Ankara being a matter of anecdotes among the inhabitants. The historical name Pisye is pre-Greek and may be compared with other pis- names encountered across Anatolia such as Pisidai, Pisilis and Pisa. A number of Turkish sources associate it with the toponym \\"Pissuwa\\" reportedly mentioned in Luwian or Hittite sources. Geography Ye≈üilyurt plain is situated in one of the pot- shaped small plains surrounded by mountains as formed by depressions in the Neogene (the other similar formations in the immediate neighborhood are the Muƒüla, G√ºlaƒüzƒ±, Yerkesik, Akkaya, Yenice, √áamk√∂y and Ula plains). Among these, Ye≈üilyurt plain, as well as √áamk√∂y and Ula plains, ceased to be fully hermetical in time, and with a smaller depression opening a passage in its north, Ye≈üilyurt plain acquired the characteristics of fluvio-karst formations, becoming the starting point of the √áine√ßay (Marsyas) that joins the Menderes river farther north near Aydƒ±n. Since, according to Greek mythology, Marsyas River stems from the blood of the satyre of the same name, punished by Apollo by being flayed and nailed to a tree for having a lost the music contest between the two, the satyre's final place of rest should be around Ye≈üilyurt. Is it to be added that, until the recent building of highways, contacts between the several plains of the inner Muƒüla region with either the coastal regions, or with the inland centers (through one of the three difficult passes; to the northwest to Milas, to the north to the Menderes plain through G√∂kbel valley following √áine√ßay, or to the northeast to Tavas) were quite arduous, and the region as a whole always tended to develop its peculiarities. Features Ye≈üilyurt is known for its hand-made textile products woven in silk or cotton. These traditional activities have been re- organized in the framework of a cooperative project in the 1990s by the then governor for Muƒüla Province, Lale Aytaman, Turkey's first female governor). Hills around Ye≈üilyurt As such, Ye≈üilyurt has become a regular furnisher of upmarket textile products to niche Turkish brands as Beymen and Vakko. The fabrics woven in Ye≈üilyurt have been used in the movies The Warrior, Harry Potter and Troy (film), through connections set up by the film costume coordinator Jeeda Barford and her Turkish husband. The locals produce the silk, the wool and the cotton fabric themselves. Natural dyes are still extensively used. Two particularities of most of Ye≈üilyurt fabrics have to do with a raw material and a color. Wild cotton, providing a more yellowish taint, is widely employed. And also, a tone of reddish brown, or a brownish red, obtained naturally from erica vulgaris and called ≈üa≈ükƒ±rmƒ±zƒ± in the region, is like a trade-mark of locally woven textiles. The color in question has always been popular in the region, and is also reflected in many artefacts from the Carian era. History View from Ye≈üilyurt plain in winter Some remains of the ancient settlement which consist of the acropolis called Pisi Asar, at a distance of about a mile to the south-east of Ye≈üilyurt and the site called Arslanlƒ± further to the north, with traces of foundations and walls, are visible on the surface to this day. Arslanlƒ± (the name meaning, the place with the lion) locality, at a distance of from the town center to the north, is where a lion's statue, on display at the near the municipality building, as well as abundant pottery was found. Further traces of stone craftsmanship is also noticeable at Arslanlƒ± and it has been suggested that ancient Pisye was constituted in two separate settlements. A number of additional findings aside from the lion's statue garnish the municipal park, and further ancient material can sometimes be detected in the structure of a few old houses and the old mosque. Epigraphical evidence points out to the tendency shown by Pisye's ancient inhabitants to expand their sphere of influence in the direction of the sea, the coast being quite near at a distance only about twenty kilometers to the south-east. By some time in the middle of the third century BC (between 275 and 225 BC) Pisye had joined part of the population of Pladasa, located near the Gulf of Akb√ºk on the Gulf of Kerme (Ceramic Gulf) in a sympoliteia in which the identity of the partners remained preserved in the new, combined entity. The joint designation persisted as late as the first century AD. This union, which may have been related to the financial troubles Pladasa was having in the late 4th century BC, had allowed Pisye to gain a port and was possibly the continuation of absorption, in fuller form this time, by Pisye of two other entities, Koloneis and Londeis, whose territories lay between Pisye and Pladasa. Another mention of Pisye dates from 196 B.C., in which the Rhodian commander Niagoras is recorded as having re-taken Pisye (together with the cities of Idyma ve Kyllandis to the sea) from king Philip V of Macedon. Under Rhodian domination the entire area of the subject \\"Rhodian Peraia\\" on the Anatolian mainland formed a buffer between Stratonikeia and the sea, in which Pisye played an important part. Both the main route along the valley of Marsyas down to the sea at Idyma at the furthest end of the Gulf of Keramos and the alternative route along the valley of the present-day Kartal Deresi (or Koca√ßay) stream down to present-day Sarnƒ±√ß and to the sea at present-day Akb√ºk, slightly west of Idyma, were lined with a series of fortresses and Pisye was where the two routes converged. The Turkish settlement in the region as a whole during the Mente≈üe period is known to have taken place through migrations following the K√ºtahya-Tavas axis. Many families in the town can trace their roots to Bozkƒ±r district of Konya. Also, with the decline of the Ottoman Empire, many Turkish migrants from the Balkans or Crete have settled here. Ye≈üilyurt has a cemetery in the typical Turkish style, situated at the top of a hill, with a view of the plain below. The tomb of a sage named Pisili Hoca is among the graves, and it is told that S√ºleyman the Magnificent had paid Pisili Hoca a visit to receive his prayers on his way to the conquest of Rhodes. Today, the tomb is a much visited shrine of local importance, with prayers and sacrifices accompanying the visits.

Furthermore, he is the founder of the New Work movement. Life and work Frithjof Bergmann first came to the US as a student, where he has lived and worked ever since. He entered the doctoral program in philosophy at Princeton University and studied under Walter Kaufmann, receiving his Ph.D. in 1959 with a dissertation entitled \\"Harmony and Reason: an Introduction to the Philosophy of Hegel.\\" In addition, Professor Bergmann is a Nietzsche scholar; his publications include \\"Nietzsche's Critique of Morality\\" (published in Reading Nietzsche, Oxford University Press, 1988). He spent most of his academic career at the University of Michigan, where he was a professor and visible political activist. He taught also at The University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University and The University of California, Santa Cruz. Among his more notable PhD students at the University of Michigan were Robert C. Solomon and Anthony Weston. He is credited as one of the creators of the teach-in, the first of which was held on the Michigan campus in March 1965.Peace Movement Now Frithjof Bergmann's interests include continental philosophyespecially Hegel, Nietzsche, Sartre, and Existentialism generallyand also social and political philosophy, philosophical anthropology, and philosophy of culture. His article The Experience of Values (reprinted in Revisions: Changing Perspectives in Moral Philosophy by University of Notre Dame Press, 1983) is used in universities throughout the world. His book On Being Free (1977) was issued in a paperback edition in 1978. In this book, Bergmann argues against the standard views of freedom as the lack of external obstacles or as an irrational, unencumbered act that rejects all order. Both of these leave us with nothing substantial for a self at alland thus, he suggests, constitute virtually a reductio ad absurdum of modern ideals of education, society, and the family. Instead, he argues that the primary prerequisite of freedom is a self possessed of something that wants to be acted out. An act is free, he argues, if the agent identifies with the elements from which it flows. The real problems of education, society, etc. are those of coming to a true understanding of one‚Äôs self and of building a society with which a self can identify. In the years between 1976 to 1979 he undertook trips to the former countries of the Eastern bloc and began to question capitalism and communism. In this time he introduces his concept of New Work. In 1984, Bergmann founded an organisation called the Center for New Work in Flint, Michigan. Together with others he formulated a novel proposal that became known as the \\"6 months --6 months proposal.\\" Books * On Being Free - University of Notre Dame, November 1977; * Menschen, M√§rkte, Lebenswelten - Differenzierung und Integration in den Systemen der Wohnungslosenhilfe - VSH Verlag Soziale Hilfe, 1999; * Neue Arbeit, Neue Kultur - Aus dem Amerikanischen √ºbersetzt von Stephan Schuhmacher - Arbor Verlag, 2004; * New Work New Culture: Work We Want and a Culture That Strengthens Us - Zero Books, 2019; ReferencesExternal links *University of Michigan Biography *An interview with Bergmann *\\"Political Idealism and Frithjof Bergmann's 'New Work'\\" *New Work, New Culture: An Interview With Frithjof Bergmann, by Sarah van Gelder Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:German philosophers Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:German male writers ","title":"Frithjof Bergmann"},{"id":"3797872","text":"Caroline is a village in central Alberta, Canada.

The bond angles are cos‚àí1(‚àí) = 109.4712206...¬∞ ‚âà 109.5¬∞ when all four substituents are the same, as in methane () as well as its heavier analogues. Methane and other perfectly symmetrical tetrahedral molecules belong to point group Td, but most tetrahedral molecules have lower symmetry. Tetrahedral molecules can be chiral.  Examples =Main group chemistry The tetrahedral molecule methane () Aside from virtually all saturated organic compounds, most compounds of Si, Ge, and Sn are tetrahedral. Often tetrahedral molecules feature multiple bonding to the outer ligands, as in xenon tetroxide (XeO4), the perchlorate ion (), the sulfate ion (), the phosphate ion (). Thiazyl trifluoride () is tetrahedral, featuring a sulfur-to-nitrogen triple bond. Other molecules have a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom; for example ammonia () with the nitrogen atom surrounded by three hydrogens and one lone pair. However the usual classification considers only the bonded atoms and not the lone pair, so that ammonia is actually considered as pyramidal. The H‚ÄìN‚ÄìH angles are 107¬∞, contracted from 109.5¬∞. This difference is attributed to the influence of the lone pair which exerts a greater repulsive influence than a bonded atom. Transition metal chemistry Calculating bond angles of a symmetrical tetrahedral molecule using a dot product Again the geometry is widespread, particularly so for complexes where the metal has d0 or d10 configuration. Illustrative examples include tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (), nickel carbonyl (), and titanium tetrachloride (). Many complexes with incompletely filled d-shells are often tetrahedral, e.g. the tetrahalides of iron(II), cobalt(II), and nickel(II). Water structure In the gas phase, a single water molecule has an oxygen atom surrounded by two hydrogens and two lone pairs, and the geometry is simply described as bent without considering the nonbonded lone pairs. However, in liquid water or in ice, the lone pairs form hydrogen bonds with neighboring water molecules. The most common arrangement of hydrogen atoms around an oxygen is tetrahedral with two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to oxygen and two attached by hydrogen bonds. Since the hydrogen bonds vary in length many of these water molecules are not symmetrical and form transient irregular tetrahedra between their four associated hydrogen atoms. Bitetrahedral structures Many compounds and complexes adopt bitetrahedral structures. In this motif, the two tetrahedra share a common edge. The inorganic polymer silicon disulfide features an infinite chain of edge-shared tetrahedra. Bitetrahedral structure adopted by (\\"aluminium tribromide\\") and (\\"gallium trichloride\\"). Exceptions and distortions Inversion of tetrahedral occurs widely in organic and main group chemistry. The so-called Walden inversion illustrates the stereochemical consequences of inversion at carbon. Nitrogen inversion in ammonia also entails transient formation of planar . Inverted tetrahedral geometry Geometrical constraints in a molecule can cause a severe distortion of idealized tetrahedral geometry. In compounds featuring \\"inverted\\" tetrahedral geometry at a carbon atom, all four groups attached to this carbon are on one side of a plane. The carbon atom lies at or near the apex of a square pyramid with the other four groups at the corners. :Inverted carbon The simplest examples of organic molecules displaying inverted tetrahedral geometry are the smallest propellanes, such as [1.1.1]propellane; or more generally the paddlanes, and pyramidane ([3.3.3.3]fenestrane). Such molecules are typically strained, resulting in increased reactivity.  Planarization  A tetrahedron can also be distorted by increasing the angle between two of the bonds. In the extreme case, flattening results. For carbon this phenomenon can be observed in a class of compounds called the fenestranes. Tetrahedral molecules with no central atom A few molecules have a tetrahedral geometry with no central atom. An inorganic example is tetraphosphorus () which has four phosphorus atoms at the vertices of a tetrahedron and each bonded to the other three. An organic example is tetrahedrane () with four carbon atoms each bonded to one hydrogen and the other three carbons. In this case the theoretical C‚àíC‚àíC bond angle is just 60¬∞ (in practice the angle will be larger due to bent bonds), representing a large degree of strain.

Patriotic Guards training. The soldiers were often equipped with World War II weapons, such as the ZB vz. 30 (center). The Patriotic Guards () were Romanian paramilitary formations formed during the Communist era, designed to provide additional defence in case of a foreign attack. History The Patriotic Guards had to defend the national infrastructure during wartime. The Patriotic Guards were formed in 1968, after the 21 August Bucharest speech through which Romanian Communist Party General Secretary and State Council President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu condemned the suppression of the Prague Spring by Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces. Ceau»ôescu appealed to anti-Sovietism within the general population to ask for resistance against the perceived threat of a similar Soviet invasion against Romania itself. The nationalist themes he used had their immediate effect in rallying large portions of the public, who began organizing and arming themselves under the direction of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). Although the threat was over by the end of the year, the Patriotic Guards remained a feature of the republic's communist structure. They became a permanent addition to the regular military, and compulsory training was introduced for young men and women. For university students, this meant that hours of the curriculum were reserved for shooting drills and other training courses; soon, they were doubled by additional requirements for work in the fields (that was also asked from high school and middle school students, as well as their teachers). No longer backed by enthusiasm as they had been in the early 1970s, the Patriotic Guards nonetheless were the basic line of defence against projected invasions. The threat posed by the latter seemed to increase as the regime plunged into isolation, especially after it lost the support of the Western Bloc in the early 1980s. From that point on, the Patriotic Guards were to become part of the State's apparatus of repression against its own people. During the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, Ceau»ôescu attempted to use them against protesters, notably in Timi»ôoara. However, the pace of events and the breadth of hostility to his regime outstripped this plan. As the Revolution progressed, many Patriotic Guard members (who like most other Romanians were fed up with Ceau≈üescu's failed economic policies and suffering from declining living standards) actually joined the protesters. To no small extent, the people who were meant to be armed in case of the disturbances were in fact the ones causing them. Function The Patriotic Guards was an all-inclusive public security organization, its functions included normal civil policing and fire-fighting, and a very large \\"People's Militia\\" force. During wartime it would provide rear area security, augment the ground forces, and operate as guerrillas if their areas were overrun by invaders. Place in the official ideology In the 1980s, Romanian communism took on a militarized form. Ilie Ceau»ôescu, general in the Romanian People's Army and brother of Nicolae, summarized the new traits in his Istoria militarƒÉ a poporului rom√¢n (\\"The Military History of the Romanian People\\"). The work (soon turned into official dogma) argued that the Romanians had always had the largest standing army in the world--notably, he consistently chose to add up the entire population as present under arms. This constituted a message for the future, since the regime had established a strong connection with all past forms. As such, the ideology behind the formation of the Patriotic Guards was rendered as the War of the Entire People military doctrine, inspired by the Yugoslav Total People's Defense doctrine. Organization The paramilitary formations were trained to adopt guerrilla warfare tactics in case of war. The Patriotic Guards were staffed by about 700,000 citizens in 1989, both men and women. In keeping with the doctrine of \\"War of the Entire People\\", the Patriotic Guards were a combined territorial defence or national guard and civil defence organization, which was established immediately after the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Patriotic Guards worked closely with the Ministry of National Defence but were directly subordinated to the PCR and its youth organization. Relying more on ordinary citizens than on the professional military, the Patriotic Guards served as a potential counterweight to or check on the power and influence of the regular armed forces. In 1989 the Patriotic Guards were organized into company- and platoon-sized units in almost every jude»õ, municipality, town, village, and industrial or agricultural enterprise. Under the command of the first secretary of the local PCR apparatus, they conducted basic and refresher training in small-arms handling, demolition, mortar and grenade-launcher firing, and small-unit tactics. In wartime they had responsibility for local antiaircraft defence, providing early warning of air attack, defending population centers and important elements of national infrastructure, and conducting civil engineering work as needed to reestablish essential military production after an attack. They would reconnoiter and attack enemy flanks and rear areas, combat airborne units and special forces penetrating deep into Romania, and mount resistance operations against occupying forces. In keeping with their guerrilla image, the Patriotic Guards wore plain uniforms with no insignia or badges of rank.

Early life Harold Hanson was born in Johannesburg, son of Ralph Hanson, a Rand pioneer and Clara Lewis. He was educated at Twist Street Government Primary School, Johannesburg and King Edward VII High School where he passed the Matriculation Exam at the age of fourteen. Hanson studied law at the University of the Witwatersrand and was called to the Bar in 1926 at the age of 22. He subsequently built up a large practice in Johannesburg dealing with civil, criminal and political cases. Legal career Harold Hanson was appointed a KC (later known as QC) in 1946. He was regarded as a very sound lawyer and a brilliant trial advocate. He appeared for the plaintiff, defendant or accused in a number of the most important and lengthy cases in South African legal history. These included the Alexander libel case, an action for damages for defamation brought by F. M. Alexander, the founder of the Alexander Technique of psycho-physical education, against Drs Jokl, Cluver and Clark (1946‚Äì48); The Parity Insurance Company case (State vs. Heller) in which he defended the accused charged with fraud (1968‚Äì70) and Gentrico A.G vs. Firestone SA (Pty) Ltd in what has been called the greatest lawsuit in the 500-year history of patents.J.R. Steyn, South African Law Journal, (1972) 89:93 He believed strongly in civil liberty and was well known for his support of political defendants, often acting on their behalf without a fee.Nelson Mandela, The first Bram Fischer memorial lecture, 9 June 1995 He is perhaps best known for his contribution to the last day of the Rivonia Trial (12 June 1964) in which he readily accepted a request from his colleague and respected friend Bram Fischer to argue mitigation for the accused.Carmel Rickard, The Trial of the Century, Sunday Times 2 January 2000 Hanson made a brilliant political appeal in a trial of politically inspired offences which in effect pleaded for the lives of the accused.Carmel Rickard, The Trial of the Century], Sunday Times 2 January 2000Towards Robben Island: the Rivonia Trial He compared the African struggle for civil rights to the early Voortrekker Afrikaner struggle and cited precedents for clement sentencing even in cases of high treason which carried the death penalty. Alan Paton, novelist, national president of the Liberal Party, a devout Christian and opponent of violence was called as the only witness. Persuaded by Hanson's argument, respected witness and world opinion, the presiding judge, Justice Quartus de Wet, commuted the death penalty for high treason to life imprisonment.Sentencing Statement of Justice Quartus de Wet in the Trial of Nelson Mandela Hanson subsequently acted as counsel for Bram Fischer when he was brought to trial. E KhanE. Khan, Dictionary of South African Biography writes: \\"Hanson was big in every way: in intellect, in physique, in voice, in courage, in application, in determination. He was fearless, if ebullient and temperamental, in court. Ever eloquent ‚Äî his colleagues would speak of \\"Hansonian eloquence\\" ‚Äî he could develop an argument for his client on fact or law at the drop of a hat. In cross-examination he was penetrating and robust, and could be fierce; he had indeed a great reputation as a cross examiner.

He first appeared in off-Broadway productions and then moved on to extensive TV and film work. He has made guest appearances on numerous hit television series and recently started working in Germany as well. He currently resides in Los Angeles. Early life and education Martin was born in West Berlin and spent his early years traveling throughout Europe while completing his education. Because of his interest in the arts, Martin studied American and English literature in Berlin and drama in Paris. He then enrolled in the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in New York City to pursue acting. While performing in small theatre productions, Martin secured a starring role in Susan Seidelman's Academy Award-nominated short film The Dutch Master. This was followed by leading roles on ABC's All My Children and Off-Broadway in Nicky Silver's critically acclaimed hit comedy The Food Chain. While in New York, Martin received recognition for his work in independent films such as Fall, High Art and When. Career After arriving in Los Angeles in 1999, he appeared in the Warner Brothers thriller Swordfish starring John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and Don Cheadle. In the film Martin plays Axl Torvalds, an internationally renowned computer hacker who leads FBI agents on the trail of a criminal mastermind. Based on his performance in Swordfish, Martin was offered a role in the German thriller Soundless. Before Swordfish Martin played a role in the original Showtime series Beggars and Choosers, an inside look at the television networks developed by Peter Lefcourt and Brandon Tartikoff that was popular within the entertainment industry.

It was released in 2006. Director John Fitzgerald financed the film almost entirely on credit cards while working freelance at various jobs in the TV and film industries. The film crew was made up of professionals from in and around Fitzgerald's hometown of Valhalla, NY, with each crew member coincidentally living in towns along the Metro North Railroad's Harlem Line ‚Äì leading to the creation of Harlem Line Pictures and, later, Harlem Line Media.  Release  Although the film received positive reviews from The New York Times, New York Post, Irish Echo, and National Public Radio, Fitzgerald opted to release it immediately before receiving a traditional distribution deal. On 25 February 2006, The Emerald Diamond debuted to a sold out crowd of 250 people at the Jacob Burns Film Center in New York. Among those in the crowd was Major League Baseball Executive Vice- President Robert Manfred. Manfred was taken with the Irish National Team's story and promised to help the film and the team in any way he could. He arranged to have the film's trailer played at Shea Stadium (New York), Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome (Minneapolis), and AT&T; Park (San Francisco). The Emerald Diamond was screened in theatres in 22 US cities and two Irish cities, between February and August 2006. Many of the US screenings were sponsored by Irish heritage organisations, baseball museums or Irish-based vodka company Boru Vodka.  Film Festivals  The film received the Critic's Choice Award at the 2006 Baseball Film Festival at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY. The award was selected and presented by film critic Jeffrey Lyons.  Media reviews and publicity stunts The film received positive reviews from The New York Times, New York Post, National Public Radio and several Irish-American newspapers. In addition, the film was featured by FoxNews, National Public Radio and Boston's CBS-4. The attraction of major media outlets is rare for a low-budget film, but was likely due to the underdog story of the Irish National Team, coupled with Fitzgerald's determination to make the film entirely on credit cards. * \\"Think of Rudy, the Notre Dame walk-on, and multiply it by about a dozen.\\" ‚Äì Jack Curry, The New York Times * \\"A terrific film!\\" ‚Äì Kevin Kernan, The New York Post * \\"A tale of perseverance, salted with humor and irrigated with beer.\\" ‚Äì Bill Littlefield, National Public Radio * \\"Emerald Diamond restores the innocence of the sport for 90 wonderful minutes, easily ranking as one of the best documentaries I've seen this year.

He noted that the script will contain several stories that didn't make it to the documentary. He refused to confirm or deny interest or involvement of any actors. Fitzgerald also announced that he has founded a nonprofit group to help further the development of Irish youth baseball and the Irish National Baseball Team.

It is to an old Irish air, and many versions of the lyric exist, the best-known being by Dion Boucicault. The song proclaims that \\"they are hanging men and women for the wearing of the green\\". The revolutionary Society of United Irishmen adopted green as its colour, and supporters wore green-coloured garments, ribbons, or cockades. In some versions, the \\"green\\" being worn is shamrock rather than fabric. Versions Many versions of the lyric exist. The general format is that the narrator is a rebel who has left Ireland for exile and meets a public figure, who asks for news from Ireland, and is told that those wearing green are being persecuted. Halliday Sparling's Irish Minstrelsy (1888) includes the anonymous \\"Green upon the Cape\\", dated to 1798.Sparling 1888, p.15 This longer poem describes the narrator's journey into exile before reaching the elements common to later versions. The narrator is a croppy from Belfast who arrives in Paris and is questioned by \\"Boney\\" (Napoleon Bonaparte). In an 1802 version published in Dundalk entitled \\"Green on my Cape\\", it is Robert Emmet who meets the narrator, in Brest.Zimmermann 2002 Versions from the 1840s and 1850s feature Napoleon. The best-known version is by Dion Boucicault, adapted for his 1864 play Arragh na Pogue, or the Wicklow Wedding, set in County Wicklow during the 1798 rebellion. In the second verse, Boucicault's version recounts an encounter between the singer and Napper Tandy, an Irish rebel leader exiled in France. Boucicault claimed to have based his version on a half-remembered Dublin street ballad.Sparling 1888, p.11 His addition of the third and last verses is in notable contrast to the middle verse in advocating emigration to America rather than staying in defiance. Boucicault himself fled to New York after leaving his wife for a young actress. Henry Grattan Curran (1800‚Äì76), son of John Philpot Curran, wrote a version of his own,Sparling 1888, p.13 and claimed the original was written in County Tipperary. Wellington Guernsey's version was published in 1866. In the 1937 Hopalong Cassidy film, North of the Rio Grande, actor Walter Long's Irish character, Bull O'Hara, leads the singing of another version of the song. The lyrics in this version are lighthearted and celebrate the beauty of Ireland. Musical source The tune of \\"The Wearing of the Green\\" was first published in The Citizen, or Dublin Monthly Magazine, vol. III, January‚ÄìJune 1841.Aloys Fleischmann (ed.): Sources of Irish Traditional Music c.1600‚Äì1855, 2 volumes (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998), , vol. 2, p. 1129, tune no. 6187. The earliest melodic variant appeared four years later under the title \\"Up! For the Green\\" in James Duffy's The Spirit of the Nation (Dublin, 1845), p. 216.Fleischmann (1998), vol. 2, p. 1165, tune no. 6367. Other melodic versions exist in Alfred Moffat's The Minstrelsy of Ireland (London, 1897; p. 56) and Francis O'Neill's O'Neill's Music of Ireland (Chicago, 1903; p. 81, tune number 467). In popular culture Gerald O'Hara sings this tune while escorting his daughters to the barbecue at Twelve Oaks in Chapter 5 of Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind. The stranger known as \\"Namgay Dooly\\" sings something like these words in the short story \\"Namgay Doolyat\\", part of Rudyard Kipling's Life's Handicap. Recordings Artists and groups to have recorded the song include John McCormack (1904, again in 1912), Judy Garland (1940), Patrick O'Malley (1961), The Kelly Family (1979), The Wolfe Tones (1985), Orthodox Celts (1997), and Irish Moutarde Allusions Irish composer Wellington Guernsey (1817‚Äì1885) made a new version for voice and piano in 1866. Similarly, an arrangement of the melody with new words by Alfred Perceval Graves was written by Charles Villiers Stanford (1852‚Äì1924) in 1900. Several 19th-century composers wrote piano arrangements of the tune,Examples taken from online catalogue of the British Library, http://catalogue.bl.uk. including Thomas Brown (1866), William Henry Goodban (1866), Fred Beyer (1875), and Willie Pape (1875). The Franco-Irish composer Joseph O'Kelly (1828‚Äì1885) used the tune of \\"The Wearing of the Green\\" in his Air irlandais op. 58 (1877) for piano, consisting of a statement of the tune in piano arrangement, followed by two virtuoso variations.Axel Klein: O'Kelly. An Irish Musical Family in Nineteenth-Century France (Norderstedt: BoD, 2014), , p. 211‚Äì213. Other songs which refer to \\"The Wearing of the Green\\" include \\"Monto\\", popularised by the Dubliners; and \\"Each Dollar A Bullet\\", by Stiff Little Fingers. Another 1798 ballad also entitled \\"The Wearing of the Green\\" references the more famous song in its chorus: 'Her faithful sons will ever sing \\"The Wearing of the Green.\\"' Songs sung to the same air include \\"The Rising of the Moon\\", whose subject is the same 1798 rising; \\"The Orange and the Green\\", about a mixed (Protestant‚ÄìCatholic) marriage; and \\"Sae Will We Yet\\" by Scottish folk group The Corries. \\"The Wearing of the Grey\\", a lament for the Confederate States Army, was published to the same tune in 1865, at the end of the American Civil War.

The desired design is cut out of the selected medium and then the image is transferred to a surface through the use of spray paint or roll-on paint. The process of stencilling involves applying paint across a stencil to form an image on a surface below. Sometimes multiple layers of stencils are used on the same image to add colours or create the illusion of depth. Because the stencil stays uniform throughout its use, it is easier for an artist to quickly replicate what could be a complicated piece at a very quick rate, when compared to other conventional tagging methods.  History  Namur, Belgium Stencil graffiti began in the 1960s. French artist Ernest Pignon-Ernest's stencilled silhouette of a nuclear bomb victim was spray painted in the south of France in 1966 (Plateau d'Albion, Vaucluse) Blek le Rat's first spray painted stencils were seen in Paris in 1981. He was influenced by the graffiti artists of New York City but wanted to create something of his own. \\"Happy 1984\\" - Stencil graffiti found on the Berlin Wall in 2005. The object depicted is a DualShock video game controller. thumbCaper An early use of stencil for a tag name, 'Caper', this was by Dee (aka Caper) around 1987. He was part of the graffiti writers group called R2F 'Ready to Fascinate', later known as the Vinyl Junkies from Hayes and Southall, London / UK. Political graffiti in Poland. Krak√≥w ul. Podg√≥rska 15. Australian photographer Rennie Ellis documented some of the earliest examples of stencil art to appear in Sydney and Melbourne in his 1985 book The All New Australian Graffiti. In the introduction to the book, Ellis noted that US photographer Charles Gatewood had written to him and sent him photographs of similar stencil graffiti that had recently appeared in New York City, leading Ellis to speculate that: > ... unlike our subway-style graffiti, which is nothing more than a copy of a > well-established New York tradition, the symbols of Australia and America > had originated separately and unknown to each other.Ellis, Rennie; The All > New Australian Graffiti, Sun Books (Macmillan), Melbourne, 1985 () Over the years this form of graffiti has become a worldwide subculture. The members are linked through the Internet and the images spray-painted on the urban canvas they place throughout the world. Many of its members connect through blogs and websites that are specifically built to display works, get feedback on posted works, and receive news of what is going on in the world of stencil graffiti. Stencil graffiti is illegal in some jurisdictions, and many of the members of this subculture shroud their identities in aliases. Above, Banksy, Blek le Rat, Vhils, and Shepard Fairey are some names that are synonymous with this subculture.

The series has been broadcast in 120 countries worldwide. Plot The tasks of the Cobra 11 team consist primarily in solving crimes and catching the perpetrators. Typical elements of the action genre are mixed, so that there are regular car crashes, shootouts, explosions and fistfights. These action scenes are elaborately produced in most cases, and appropriately presented in a spectacular way. The high number of unrealistic scenes is a common criticism of the series; for example, large explosions often happen after small collisions while people emerge unharmed out of cars which have sustained catastrophic damage.

(for the men of Cobra 11) Stunts The series is known for its extremely well performed stuntwork, which features the destruction of various vehicles in every episode. Almost every episode has a distinct structure, with at least one daring action sequence and the pre-title sequence usually consisting of the main event (i.e. a devastating crash on the Autobahn). The stuntwork is often so spectacular that it would not look out of place in a full-fledged movie, with cars commonly reaching implausible heights as they vault through the air.

Those episodes were shot in Berlin, notably in the site of the former Checkpoint Bravo and in the surrounding state of Brandenburg. In 1998, Action Concept took over as the sole production company and shifted all filming/production work to its headquarters in H√ºrth just south of Cologne. Since then, episodes have been shot in and around Cologne and D√ºsseldorf as well as on several major Autobahnen (A540/A44 and now mainly on the Filmautobahn Aldenhoven near D√ºren ‚Äì ) between Cologne and D√ºsseldorf in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW).

It is located on the Northside of the Irish capital city, Dublin. History When Croke Park was first used for Gaelic games, the Railway End of the park was little more than a mound of earth. Its name was originally \\"Hill 60\\". That name came from a hill of the same name in Gallipoli on which the Connaught Rangers suffered heavy casualties in late August 1915. Contrary to common belief, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers did not participate in the Battle of Hill 60, although the latter regiment did lose heavily during the wider Gallipoli campaign (including at 'V' Beach, Cape Helles, the previous April). \\"Hill 60\\" was used as a name throughout the 1920s and 1930s, until senior GAA figures decided it would be inappropriate to have a section of Croke Park named after a battle involving an Irish unit of the British Army. So \\"Hill 60\\" became Hill 16, a name that would link it instead to 1916, and the story emerged that it had been built from the ruins of Dublin's main thoroughfare O'Connell Street. The Hill traditionally lags behind the rest of the stadium when it comes to comfort. It was only in 1936, when the Cusack Stand was redeveloped, that the turf and mud of Hill 16 was replaced with concrete terracing. After the 1983 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final between Dublin and Galway, when overcrowding on Hill 16 caused a few supporters to suffer injuries, the GAA decided to rebuild the Hill. See the section titled \\"Losing the plot\\". That work was completed in 1988, allowing a capacity of 10,000 spectators. In the mid-1990s, the GAA came up with a masterplan to rebuild the whole stadium. It was envisaged that Hill 16 would be replaced with an all-seater stand; however, this idea met with opposition from supporters of Dublin. Dublin fans have adopted Hill 16 as a spiritual home over the years. On matchdays the hill is often a sea of blue and navy and has been said to be intimidating to opposition players. Plans were also hindered by the presence of the nearby railway line and the fact that the GAA does not own any of the land behind Croke Park. The plans were redrawn and a new ‚Äì terraced ‚Äì area built at a cost of ‚Ç¨25 million to replace the old Nally Stand ‚Äì named after Pat Nally ‚Äì and Hill 16. The new Railway End, which includes Hill 16 and the Nally terrace, is capable of holding more than 13,000 spectators. In 2006, the Hill was renamed Dineen Hill 16 in honour of Frank Dineen, who purchased the grounds for the GAA in 1908. From 2007‚Äì2009, Croke Park temporarily hosted association football and rugby union matches while the bodies overseeing these sports redeveloped their own stadium on the Southside of the city. This was agreed with the GAA so as to prevent Irish national teams having to play their games in England. For most of the international association football matches, temporary seating was added to comply with the rules of that sport's governing body. At every association football game at the stadium, seats were either added to the Hill or it remained closed (despite UEFA regulations allowing terraces to be used for friendly games). Since the redevelopment of the IRFU-owned stadium at Lansdowne Road, the usage of the stadium for association football and rugby union matches has ceased.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on June 8, 2003. The episode was written by Bill Odenkirk and directed by Ron Hughart. The plot of this episode revolves around the Planet Express crew's adventures in parallel universes. Plot After an experiment nearly kills him, Professor Farnsworth plans to destroy a yellow box containing said experiment by ejecting it into the sun. He forbids the Planet Express staff to open it, and Hermes assigns Leela to guard it, after she makes excuses not to go out on a date with Fry. While she keeps the others from looking in, she finds herself tempted and flips a coin to decide whether or not to look inside; after getting a positive answer, she falls into the box and finds herself in a parallel universe with other versions of the Planet Express crew. The parallel Leela orders everyone in the original universe to come into their universe, as the parallel Professor believes that the original universe members are all evil. The two Farnsworths discover that, just as the original Farnsworth created a box containing a parallel universe, the parallel universe Farnsworth created a box containing the original universe. They also discover the major difference between the two realities: namely, coin flips have opposite outcomes, which explains why the parallel Leela did not open the box that she was guarding. Fry and Leela are also surprised to discover that their doppelgangers are happily married, because at one point the two Leelas each flipped a coin to decide whether or not accept a date from Fry. The Professors eventually decide that nobody is evil and the members of both universes spend time befriending one another. However, just before the original Planet Express crew returns home, parallel Hermes comes in to destroy the box containing the original universe. The crew realize that this means the original-universe Hermes must be doing the same thing to the box containing the parallel universe (i.e., the universe that they are all in). They plan to go back through the box to stop Hermes but discover that the box is missing, having been stolen by the two Zoidbergs. The two Farnsworths try to recreate the original box, but end up creating a large number of boxes containing different universes. The Zoidbergs flee into the boxes, leading to a chase across multiple odd dimensions. They are eventually caught, however, and everyone jumps into the box containing the original universe just in time to save it from Hermes. The two crews say goodbye before returning to their respective universes. To ensure the safety of both, the Farnsworths exchange their universe-boxes by pulling each through the other, meaning that each now paradoxically has a box containing their own universe. Meanwhile, Fry asks Leela on a date again; she flips a coin, then decides to accept without looking at it. Broadcast and reception In 2006, this episode was ranked 17th on IGN's list of the top 25 episodes of Futurama. The episode was noted for its humor as a standalone episode and in particular for Universe #420 where Professor Farnsworth tells his hippie counterpart to get a job. The 2013 revision of the list bumped the episode up to number 16, reassessing it as better than \\"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\\", \\"Space Pilot 3000\\", the two \\"Anthology of Interest\\" episodes, \\"Parasites Lost\\", \\"Fry and the Slurm Factory\\", and \\"Love's Labors Lost in Space\\", all of which had previously been ranked higher. The reassessment praised the episode's study of alternate Futurama realities. In 2013, it was ranked number 6 \\"as voted on by fans\\" for Comedy Central's Futurama Fanarama marathon.

With words by Max Miller, Sam Kern & James Walsh and music by Sam Kern, it became Miller's signature tune, played by the orchestra when he walked on stage. It was a mildly risqu√© song about Max Miller falling for Mary from the dairy and includes the lines \\"I don't do things by halves / I'll let you see my calves / and they're not the same shaped calves as Nellie Dean's.\\" Sam Kern, the composer, said that the idea for the song came to him as he was sitting in the Express Dairies in Charing Cross Road. The waitress was called Mary. He started writing the song on a cigarette packet, took it to an orchestrator Arthur Parry and rushed to the Mile End Empire where he met Miller. He said to him that this song will do for you what ‚Äò‚ÄôSally‚Äô‚ÄôGracie Fields‚Äô signature tune did for Gracie Fields.

Bedwell was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. He served the Anglican Church as Rector of St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate and Vicar of All Hallows, Tottenham (known at the time as Tottenham High Cross) from 1607. He was the author of the first local history of the area, A Briefe Description of the Towne of Tottenham.British History Online, quoting the Dictionary of National Biography He published in quarto an edition of the Epistles of John in Arabic, with a Latin version, printed by the Raphelengius family at Antwerp in 1612. He also left many Arabic manuscripts to the University of Cambridge and a font of type for printing them. According to McClure, it was Bedwell, and not Thomas Van Erpen, who was the first to revive the study of Arabic literature in Europe. His uncompleted preparations for an Arabic Lexicon were eclipsed by the publication of a similar work by Jacobus Golius in 1653. He asserted that knowledge of Arabic was necessary to a deeper understanding of ancient Hebrew.Bobrick, Benson. (2001).

Bedwell's manuscripts were loaned, following his death, to the University of Cambridge, where they were consulted by Edmund Castell during the creation of the monumental Lexicon Heptaglotton (1669). Another manuscript, for a Dictionary of Persian, was in the possession of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, and now resides at the Bodleian Library.

The report was an important American document that appeared just before the start of the early Cold War. It proposed the international control of nuclear weapons and the avoidance of future nuclear warfare.History Channel: Acheson‚ÄìLilienthal Report released As American distrust of Stalin grew, the Report was simply ignored. A version, the Baruch Plan, was vetoed by the USSR at the UN. Historical context Two schools of thought concerning nuclear weapons emerged in the United States immediately after the end of World War II. One school, which had Secretary of War Henry Stimson as its chief proponent, believed that the apparent secrets of the atomic bomb were scientific in nature, and could not be monopolised forever. They further felt that to hold the bomb ostentatiously in reserve, whilst negotiating with the Soviet Union not to develop one, would simply drive Russia into developing their own weapon to restore the balance of power. The other school included men like Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, who felt that the US monopoly on atomic weapons had been honestly earned, and should not be surrendered. In their view, the Soviet Union understood only power, and could only be met with nuclear weapons. President Harry S. Truman was divided between the two positions. He was distrustful of the Soviet Union, but still did not want to lead the world down a path to destruction. He continued to solicit views from both sides. Stimson resigned in September 1945, and thereafter the task of promoting his approach fell primarily on Under Secretary of State and later Secretary of State Dean Acheson. A proposal to pass the responsibility for the control of atomic energy to a United Nations Atomic Energy Commission was endorsed by both the USA and the Soviets in 1945. They had the forum, but the United States had not yet articulated a policy that it wished the new commission to adopt. To resolve the problem, Acheson was appointed to head a committee to determine United States policy on atomic energy, the Committee on Atomic Energy, set up on January 7, 1946. A letter of transmittal at the beginning of the Report embodies the comments which Mr. Acheson's Committee made on the unanimous findings and recommendations of the Board of Consultants. The other members of the committee were scientists James Conant and Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which controlled the Manhattan Project, and John McCloy, and General Leslie R. Groves, who had been the military officer in charge of the Manhattan Project. Acheson decided that the committee needed technical advice, so he appointed a board of consultants with David Lilienthal, the well-regarded chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, as chairman. He also appointed J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific leader of the Manhattan Project, who provided influential advice. Oppenheimer‚Äôs contribution lay in an idea to police the production of atomic weapons from monitoring source mines for uranium. Overview of the report On March 16, 1946, the committee's report was presented to the State Department, which released it to the public on March 28. The Report on the International Control of Atomic Energy soon became known as the Acheson‚ÄìLilienthal Report. The primary message of the report was that control of atomic energy through inspections and policing operations was unlikely to succeed. Instead, the report proposed that all fissile material be owned by an international agency to be called the Atomic Development Authority, which would release small amounts to individual nations for the development of peaceful uses of atomic energy. In the first years of the atomic era, it was generally believed that the great obstacle facing a would-be developer of an atomic bomb was the acquisition of sufficient fissile material. In response, the Acheson‚ÄìLilienthal Report proposed that the complete path from the uranium and thorium mines to post production be under international ownership. In addition, the report proposed that the United States abandon its monopoly on atomic weapons, revealing what it knew to the Soviet Union, in exchange for a mutual agreement against the development of additional atomic bombs. This was to prove too controversial. Although Truman accepted the report in general, his appointment of financier Bernard Baruch to carry the proposal forward in the United Nations led to demands for punishment for violations, and that those penalties could not be vetoed by the United Nations Security Council, as well as unrestricted inspections within the USSR, whilst still insisting that the USSR should agree not to develop the bomb. These were modifications that neither Acheson nor Lilienthal accepted. This, combined with U.S. continued insistence on retaining the bomb until they were satisfied with the effectiveness of international control, ultimately led to the plan's rejection by the Soviet Union, to the surprise of no one.  Authors  The consultants heading the project comprised Chester Barnard, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Charles A. Thomas, Harry A. Winne, and David E. Lilienthal, while the official authors, who had worked on the Manhattan Project and included some of the United States' top scientists, comprised Luis Walter Alvarez, Robert F. Bacher, Manson Benedict, Hans Bethe, Arthur Compton, Farrington Daniels, J. Robert Oppenheimer, John R. Ruhoff, G. T. Seaborg, Frank Spedding, Charles A. Thomas, and Walter Zinn.

Biography=Theological preparation Moisescu was born in C√¢nde»ôti, Arge»ô County. He studied at the war orphans‚Äô seminary in C√¢mpulung-Muscel from 1922 to 1930, finishing with top honours. Patriarch Miron Cristea selected him alone, of all 1930 seminary graduates, to receive a scholarship and take his licentiate in theology at the University of Athens. In 1934, he returned to Romania, having received a degree ‚Äúarista‚Äù (magna cum laude). Cristea, following Moisescu's progress, sent him (upon the recommendation of the University of Athens and of the Romanian Embassy in Greece) to continue his advanced studies at the Faculty of Roman Catholic Theology at the Universit√© des Sciences Humaines in Strasbourg. After two years in France (1934‚Äì36), having obtained material for his doctoral thesis, he returned to Athens in 1936. The following year he obtained his doctorate with the Greek-language thesis ‚ÄúEvagrius Ponticus. Life, writings and teachings‚Äù, which received an award from the Athens Academy of Sciences. He then took equivalence examinations at the University of Bucharest‚Äôs Faculty of Theology. There followed a quick succession of professorates, with rapid promotion: Professor of Latin at Bucharest‚Äôs Nifon Seminary (1937‚Äì38); New Testament Professor at the University of Warsaw‚Äôs Faculty of Orthodox Theology (1938‚Äì39), where he replaced the celebrated professor Nicolae Arseniev. In Warsaw, he established the following Polish-language courses: ‚ÄúGeneral and specific introduction to the holy books of the New Testament‚Äù; ‚ÄúExegesis of Saint Paul‚Äôs Epistle to the Galatians‚Äù; and ‚ÄúExegesis of the prologue to the Gospel of John‚Äù. These courses were examined by professors Milan »òesan and Vladimir Prelipceanu, who ‚Äúdetermined their scientific and didactic value, as well as their full harmony with the teachings of the Orthodox Church‚Äù. In 1940, he was named associate professor. In 1942, after an examination, he was named Professor of New Testament Exegesis at the CernƒÉu≈£i-Suceava Faculty of Theology. At CernƒÉu»õi and Suceava he created three more courses: ‚ÄúIntroduction to the holy books of the New Testament‚Äù, ‚ÄúExegesis‚Äù and ‚ÄúBiblical hermeneutics‚Äù. About his Romanian-language writings, the same report notes that ‚ÄúThe author‚Äôs form of expression in Romanian is distinguished by conciseness and clarity‚Äù. In 1946 he was transferred as professor to the same department at the Faculty of Theology in Bucharest; in 1948, he began teaching at the Bucharest Theological Institute. During his time as a theology professor, he published a number of specialised works. Metropolitan of Transylvania Another series of promotions followed after a turn unforeseen by many at the time, but in the best tradition of precedents not only Byzantine, but also Eastern European and even Romanian, especially Transylvanian: witness Photius‚Äô elevation to Patriarch of Constantinople from general, Ambrose becoming Bishop of Milan from civil administrator, professor Nicolae BƒÉlan becoming Metropolitan of Transylvania, etc. On February 23, 1956, Vicar Bishop Teoctist ArƒÉpa»ôu ordained him deacon; the next day, the other Patriarchal Vicar Bishop, Antim Nica, ordained him priest, and on February 26, the National Church Council, gathered in electoral college according to its statute‚Äôs provisions, elected him Archbishop of Sibiu and Metropolitan of Transylvania. He replaced the eminent and recently deceased Nicolae BƒÉlan. He then spent ten days in meditation before asking God to receive him into the ranks of the monks at Cernica Monastery on March 8, 1956. Already elected metropolitan, on March 15, 1956 Patriarch Justinian, Metropolitan Firmilian of Oltenia and Bishop Nicolae Colan of Cluj ordained him into the episcopate. Three days later, in the Sibiu Metropolitan Cathedral, he was given Andrei »òaguna‚Äôs crozier. During his short stay in Sibiu, among other activities, he founded the theological magazine Mitropolia Ardealului (nr. 1‚Äì2, Sep‚ÄìOct 1956) in place of the defunct Revista TeologicƒÉ. Before Moisescu‚Äôs election as Metropolitan of Transylvania, Patriarch Justinian, in a long, meaningful and well-considered speech before the electoral college, described thus the candidate who should be elected: ‚ÄúThere we will have to send the best of today‚Äôs clerics from our Church, a vigorously well-rounded personality, with a distinguished theological preparation, thoroughly aware of all the problems that our contemporary world presents‚Äù, for ‚Äúnew times require new people‚Äù. Metropolitan of Moldavia and Suceava Metropolitan Iustin spent only a short time at Sibiu. On January 10, 1957, he was elected Metropolitan of Moldavia and Suceava, and three days later he was installed in the seat once held by Dosoftei, Varlaam, Veniamin Costache, to name only the most prominent of his predecessors at Ia»ôi. Upon his election as Metropolitan of Moldavia and Suceava, he described his programme thus: ‚ÄúWith all my efforts I will undertake with steadfast resolve to protect and keep the Holy places: churches, monasteries and sketes ‚Äì glorious works of art ‚Äì that form the diadem of the Metropolitanate of Moldavia; and for those who need these treasures of our ancient faith, I will strive to produce priests who are hard-working and devoted to the Church, the Fatherland and the good of the people. Unceasingly I shall keep watch over the direction my Diocese‚Äôs priests are taking, for the complete fulfillment of its duties toward the Church and the Fatherland. I will ensure as far as possible that the fruits of priestly work will be seen in the good administration of our places of worship, in the preaching of love among all the sons of the Fatherland and in the charitable giving for the popular good‚Äù. On February 3, 1957, Metropolitan Iustin was first elected deputy to the Great National Assembly, representing H√¢rlƒÉu. He would be elected six more times, sitting until his death. As Metropolitan of Moldavia, he undertook numerous activities. New buildings ‚Äì veritable architectural monuments ‚Äì were erected on the grounds of the Ia»ôi diocesan centre, while his Cathedral and residence were redone. Numerous monasteries and churches, the diocese's historic monuments, were also restored. Museums or museum collections associated with these monuments were started for many of them. New buildings were raised at the Neam»õ Monastery Theological Seminary, and the old ones were modernised. In Moldavia, along with his numerous travels and external cares, he initiated, with the talent of a born architect, the radical transformation of the Metropolitan Centre from a random assortment of run-down buildings into a modern centre fit for his time. Also endowed with an unexpected practical spirit, he had constructed, under conditions of full-blown Communism, three large buildings in the diocesan centre (two administrative buildings and a dormitory for priests), over 70 new churches and chapels, 52 parish houses and five archpriests‚Äô residences. He founded ten museums of ecclesiastical art, having obtained funds from the state and from parishioners‚Äô donations. He restored, in full or in part, over twenty monasteries and sketes: Putna, Sucevi»õa, Moldovi»õa, Vorone»õ, Arbore, Humor, Slatina, DobrovƒÉ»õ, CetƒÉ»õuia, R√¢»ôca, Neam»õ, SihƒÉstria, Secu, Bistri»õa, VƒÉratec. He led several Romanian Orthodox delegations visiting other churches and countries: the Church of England (1958), the Malabar Syriac Church (1961), the United States (1970), the Danish National Church (1971) and the Ecumenical Patriarchate (1974). He took part in several synodal delegations led by Patriarch Justinian and received numerous foreign delegations at Ia≈üi or within the Ia≈üi Archdiocese. As a member of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches (1961‚Äì77), he participated in general congresses at New Delhi (1961), Uppsala (1969) and Nairobi (1975) as well as at the annual sessions of the Central Committee at Paris (1962), Geneva (1966, 1973 and 1976), Heraklion (1967), Canterbury (1969), Addis Ababa (1971), Utrecht (1972), Berlin (1974), etc. He was part of the Presidium of the Conference of European Churches and of its Consultative Committee, participating in the Nyborg IV (1964), Nyborg V (1966), Nyborg VI (1971) and Engelberg (1974) General Assemblies, as well as at sessions of the Presidium and the Consultative Committee. He led delegations of the Romanian Orthodox Church to pan-Orthodox conferences at Rhodes (1961, 1963, 1964) and Chambesy (1968), and to the first preparatory conference of the Holy and Great Pan-Orthodox Synod (Chambesy, 1971). As metropolitan, he published numerous articles, pastoral letters, speeches and editorials, especially in the magazine Mitropolia Moldovei »ôi Sucevei, which appeared for twenty years under his direct supervision. In addition, the Ia≈üi Metropolitan Centre edited other works, among them Monumente istorice- biserice»ôti din Mitropolia Moldovei »ôi Sucevei (1974) and Psaltirea √Æn versuri a lui Dosoftei, edi»õie criticƒÉ (1975); the monographs Catedrala MitropolitanƒÉ din Ia»ôui and MƒÉnƒÉstirea CetƒÉ»õuia (both 1977); brochure-albums to popularise the monasteries of Moldavia, prayer books, etc. Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church Patriarch Justinian died in March 1977. On June 12, 1977, Metropolitan Iustin was elected Archbishop of Bucharest, Metropolitan of Ungro-Vlachia,. Patriarch of All Romania. He was enthroned at the Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral, Bucharest, on June 19, 1977. Iustin remained in office until he died in Bucharest on July 31, 1986, and was buried in the Patriarchal Cathedral. As patriarch, he led several synodal delegations to other churches: the Ecumenical Patriarchate (1978), the Orthodox Church in America Romanian Episcopate (1979), the Russian Orthodox Church (1980), the Serbian Orthodox Church (1981), the Church of Sweden (1981), the Geneva headquarters of the World Council of Churches (1981), the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (1982), the Reformed Church in Hungary (1982) and the Church of Greece (1984). In return, he was visited by a number of church leaders, as well as by numerous representatives of other churches and Christian denominations from all over the world. Patriarch Iustin paid special attention to publishing activity. He began the great collection PƒÉrin»õi »ôi scriitori biserice»ôti (projected to span 90 volumes), as well as the six-volume set Arta cre»ôtinƒÉ √Æn Rom√¢nia. A new synod-approved edition of the Bible appeared in 1982, a new New Testament in 1979, as well as textbooks for higher theological education and for theological seminaries, doctoral theses and devotional books. The Patriarchate's magazines continued to be published, as well as those of the metropolitanates and bulletins for Romanian Orthodox communities abroad. He helped restore some of Romania's most important churches and monasteries, continuing the work he had begun at Ia»ôi. Among the monasteries in question are Curtea de Arge»ô, Cheia, Zamfira, Vifor√¢ta, Dealu, Cernica, PasƒÉrea, »öigƒÉne»ôti, CƒÉldƒÉru»ôani, Sf√¢ntul Spiridon Nou and Sf√¢ntul Gheorghe.

Over the next seven seasons the club won the league twice, in the 1977‚Äì78 season and the 1981‚Äì82 season. In their last season in the North Berks League, the club almost won the league again after finishing level on points with Berinsfield, though they lost out after a 5‚Äì4 defeat in a play-off for the title. In 1983‚Äì84, Rangers joined the Hellenic Football League Division One, gaining promotion to the Premier Division in the 1987‚Äì88 season and staying there until 1999, when they left to re-join the North Berks Football League. During this stint in the North Berks League, the club lifted the league title three times in a row from the 2001‚Äì02 season and achieved the treble of the league, North Berks Cup & North Berks Charity Shield in the 2001‚Äì02 and 2002‚Äì03 seasons. They then rejoined the Hellenic Football League in the 2004‚Äì05 season, finishing runners-up in Division One East in their first season back. They stayed in the division until the 2010/11 season, before leaving again to re-join the North Berks League. Rangers claimed the first silverware since their return to the North Berks Football League in April 2014, defeating Ardington & Lockinge 5-3 in extra-time to lift the North Berks Charity Shield for the third time. The season was rounded off when they defeated Saxton Rovers 3-1 in the final game of the season at the Recreation Ground to secure the North Berks Football League Division One title, losing just once throughout the campaign. Rangers redemption after losing their crown to Berinsfield in a fiercely contended battle in 2014-15 came on 7 May 2016, as they regained the North Berks Football League Division One title. Kintbury did their part, beating Long Wittenham Athletic 2-1 at the Recreation Ground, before local rivals and fellow title hopefuls Lambourn Sports F.C. were dismantled 4-1 by Saxton Rovers to hand Rangers their seventh NBFL Division One success.http://www.nbfl.co.uk/weekreport.asp?w=36&d;=20160507 The First Team's title win was accompanied by a historic season from the Reserves side as they completed a cup treble, winning the North Berks Football League AG Kingham Cup & Nairne Paul Trophy and the Berks & Bucks Football Association County Junior Cup for the first time, as well as finishing as runners-up in the North Berks Division Two.

For the last decade of his life he was professor of Hebrew at Leiden University. He produced an Arabic-Latin dictionary, about 550 pages, published posthumously in 1613 at Leiden. This was the first publication by printing press of a book-length dictionary for the Arabic language in Latin. Raphelengius was born at Lannoy and studied Greek and Hebrew at the University of Paris in his early 20s. As an employee of the printer Christopher Plantin at Antwerp, he collaborated on the Plantin Polyglot Bible in which the Bible was printed in Hebrew, Aramaic (Chaldaic), Syriac, Greek, and Latin (published at Antwerp 1569‚Äì1573). He married one of Plantin's daughters at Antwerp, and later he managed the Plantin printing office in Leiden and was official printer for Leiden university. His sons continued the Raphelengius printing business. His scholarly printing qualities were one of the attractions that drew Joseph Justus Scaliger to Leiden in 1593. Raphelengius learned Arabic in Antwerp and Leiden, starting in the early 1570s, and was doing it intensively in the early 1590s. His Arabic-to-Latin dictionary was intended for people like himself who were trying to read Arabic texts in Europe; it was superseded by the 1653 Arabic-to-Latin dictionary of Jacobus Golius.

Route description Signage for IX Center Drive Interchange SR-237 begins at Royalton Road (SR 82) in Strongsville, heading northbound towards Berea as Prospect Road. About four miles in, the route turns eastwards onto Bagley Road in Berea, then north onto Front Street 0.1 miles later. After continuing on Front Street for about 1 mile, the route makes a slight turn onto North Rocky River Drive, which becomes a freeway as it enters Brook Park after Sheldon Road. This portion of the route, which connects Cleveland Hopkins International Airport to Interstate 480 (I-480) and I-71, is known as the Berea Freeway (or the Airport Freeway). At the northeast corner of the airport, SR 237 has an interchange with SR 17 (Brookpark Road), I-480, and I-71. In this interchange, SR 237 leaves the Berea Freeway for surface streets, which involve a slight concurrency with SR 17\\\\. The ramp extensions of the freeway proper merge onto I-71. North of this interchange, SR 237 proceeds along Rocky River Drive (which is parallel to the Rocky River) until its northern terminus at Clifton Boulevard (US-6).

This waterway was of enormous strategic significance for Britain at this time. Located three kilometers south of Port Ibrahim and four kilometers south of the city of Suez and the mouth of the Suez Canal, the fortress was built on a bed of stable corals and made out of reinforced concrete. It consisted of a one-storey building with a large courtyard. At one end of the island, a concrete bridge jutted out into the water toward a circular five-metre-high tower supporting a radar site and two heavy anti-aircraft machine guns. A wall reinforced with thick rows of barbed wire was built at the water's edge, to deter attack from the sea. Heavy machine guns were emplaced in the roof, and there were over a dozen machine gun nests. A series of concrete bunkers sat atop an seawall, ringed by razor wire three rolls deep. There were several gun emplacements . In 1969, during the War of Attrition between Israel and Egypt, the island was heavily defended. Its garrison consisted of approximately 70 Egyptian infantrymen and 12 special forces commandos, 14 machine gun positions (14.5 mm to 25 mm), two 37 mm anti-aircraft guns, and four 85 mm anti-aircraft guns. On the night of July 19, 1969 the island was raided by Israeli commandos (Operation Bulmus 6). The Egyptian facilities on the island were completely destroyed with Israeli casualties of three Sayeret Matkal and three Shayetet 13 commandos killed, and 11 wounded‚Äîa casualty rate of approximately 50%.

Members of the Guild write dramatic TV series, feature films, Movies of the Week, documentaries, animation, comedy and variety series, children's and educational programming, radio drama, as well as corporate videos and digital media productions. The organization administers the Canadian Screenwriting Awards. The WGC is the voice of professional Canadian screenwriters - lobbying on their behalf, protecting their interests, and working to raise the profile of screenwriters and screenwriting. Most importantly, on behalf of its members, the Guild negotiates, administers and enforces collective agreements, setting out minimum rates, terms, and working conditions in the Guild's jurisdiction ‚Äî all English-language production in Canada. The central collective agreement, the Independent Production Agreement (IPA), is negotiated between the Guild and the Canadian Media Production Association (CMPA), the association representing independent producers in Canada. In addition to the IPA, the Guild also has agreements in place with the APFTQ, CBC Radio, CBC Television, CTV, the NFB and TVOntario. The WGC is formally recognized as the official bargaining agent for English-language professional screenwriters under the federal Status of the Artist Act and Quebec's Status of the Artist Legislation. The Guild is a member of the International Affiliation of Writers Guilds, comprising: the Australian Writers' Guild, The Writers' Guild of Great Britain, The Writers Guild of America (East & West), Societe des Auteurs, Recherchistes, Documentalistes et Compositeurs (Quebec) and the New Zealand Writers Guild. The WGC also serves the industry by: * Providing industry-standard writing contracts and checking agreements to ensure they comply with the WGC's collective agreements * Ensuring proper payment of script fees and royalties and resolving disputes over working conditions and credits * Serving as the voice for screenwriters by undertaking extensive policy and lobbying activities, working closely with government agencies to promote Canada's indigenous film and television industry * Publishing Canadian Screenwriter, a quarterly magazine with features, news, reviews and vital industry information * Administering a script registration service to help writers protect their work * Hosting an annual awards ceremony honouring outstanding screenwriting * Keeping an on- line directory of members for industry organizations * Providing professional development and training opportunities for members and new writers * Administering the Canadian Screenwriters Collection Society, which collects royalties and levies arising from secondary uses made in Europe and other jurisdictions History In 1943 The Association of Canadian Radio Artists was formed in order to establish better working conditions and wages for radio performers. Writers joined in on this organization, and over the next decade the organization transformed into the Association of Canadian Television and Radio Artists. By 1984 the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) was formed to better include the other areas of the broadcasting industry. From this organization, other Guilds formed and matured. Most notably the ACTRA Performer's Guild, Writers Guild of Canada, and ACTRA Media Guild. In 1993 The Writers Guild of Canada left ACTRA and became an independent union. The Writers Guild of Canada, however, is different from the traditional union. There is no central workplace in the writing industry, and members are not employees, they are independent contractors. This creates legal complications as Provincial labour legislation states that only employees, not independent contractors (with exception of construction workers), can bargain as a collective. This means that WGC members are bound to very tight restrictions in order to protect their rights and their work. Governance Two bodies govern the Guild jointly: a seven- member council and a fifteen-member national forum. Both the council and the national forum are made up of elected Guild members. These members are elected from Canada's five regions (Atlantic, Quebec, Central, Western and Pacific). Terms last for two years. The council oversees activities and sets Guild policies, while the national forum meets annually with the council and the executive staff to add their input. The Guild's executive staff is in charge of managing the Guild's day-to-day operations. The Executive director of the Guild is Maureen Parker. Council Members: * President: Jill Golick (Central Region) * Vice-President: Andrew Wreggitt (Western Region) * Treasurer: Mark Ellis (Central Region) * Councillors: Michael Amo (Atlantic Region), Denis McGrath (Central Region), Anne-Marie Perrotta (Quebec Region), Dennis Heaton (Pacific Region) Membership You are qualified to join the WGC if you: * Are within the WGC's jurisdiction * Have one writing contract * Are with a producer who is 'signatory' to one of the WGC's agreements. Membership fees are dependent on when you join: * Before July 1: $500 ($350 initiation fee + $150 basic fee) * After July 1: $425 ($350 initiation fee + $75 basic fee) * To remain a member you must pay the $150 annual fee. Benefits of Membership: * Fair Pay: The WGC ensures that screenwriters are paid fairly through administration, and enforcement, of collective agreements. In addition, the WGC resolves disputes on behalf of its members. Members also have access (through ACTRA Fraternal Benefit Society) to insurance and retirement benefits. * Advocacy: The WGC consistently advocates, on behalf of its members, for policies and programs that better support Canadian screenwriters. By working with the CRTC, Canadian Government, and other industry partners, the WGC is dedicated to being a voice for Canadian writers. * Community: The WGC is a great resource for those who want to connect with other writers or producers. The WGC is a member of the International Affiliation of Writers Guilds (IAWG). * Profile: The WGC maintains the Directory of Members which is a great way for potential employers to search out screenwriters. The WGC also makes an effort to celebrate the achievements of its members, thus raising their profile. * Intellectual Property Registration Service: The WGC offers this to both members and non-members. It is a service that helps establish the identity and date of completion of literary materials (books, scripts, etc.) in order to protect an individual's intellectual property. Funding Initiatives and Awards * Bell Media Diverse Screenwriters Program The Writers Guild runs a program called the Diverse Screenwriters Program in collaboration with Bell Media. This program is geared towards encouraging diversity within the Canadian artistic landscape. The program is divided into two sessions, one for Eastern Canada and one for Western Canada. Up to eight up-and-coming screenwriters participate in each weeklong session or training, and two are offered a paid internship as a writer on one of Bell Media's TV shows. Participants are also connected with an experienced scriptwriter for three months in order to hone their pitching skills and ideas. * WGC Screenwriting Awards These awards have been given out since 1996 to honor the achievements of Guild members in television, film, short film, documentary and writing for the web. * Sondra Kelly Award This award is given annually to a female screenwriter who already has several writing credits and a current project in the works.

History  In 2004, the school forbade a student from wearing an anti-gay T-shirt during the school's gay‚Äìstraight alliance's Day of Silence. The student, Tyler Chase Harper, filed suit, claiming that the school had violated his constitutional rights. The case was Harper v. Poway Unified School District. In 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a divided decision, denied the student's claim and held that the school's regulation of student speech in this case was constitutional. The student sought review in the U.S. Supreme Court; in 2007, the Court vacated the judgment as moot because Harper had graduated. In 2011, in a separate case, Johnson v. Poway Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit found that the school board could order a teacher to remove religious decorations (specifically, 7-foot wide, 2-foot high banners bearing Christian phrases) from his classroom, holding that the speech of teachers in school settings is government speech.

History Belle Leavitt, third woman admitted to Maine Bar Association, 1900, with law partner Fred J. Allen Women faced significant barriers in entering the legal profession in the US. In 1875, for instance, the Wisconsin Supreme Court denied Lavinia Goodell admission to the state bar on the grounds that \\"[n]ature has tempered woman as little for the juridical conflicts of the court room, as for the physical conflicts of the battle field. Womanhood is moulded [sic] for gentler and better things.\\"In Re Goodell 39 Wis. 232 (1875); Supreme Court of Wisconsin; Retrieved July 31, 2012 In June 1869, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that Arabella Mansfield could not be denied a chance to take the bar exam because she is a woman. She took the exam and passed, becoming the first licensed female lawyer in the United States. In 1872, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a decision from the Supreme Court of Illinois that denied Myra Bradwell admission to the state bar. The state Supreme Court had reasoned that because state law invalidated any contract entered into by a married woman without the consent of her husband, women (most of whom would be married) could not adequately represent her clients. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed, noting that even though some women might not actually be married, such women were the rare exceptions. The U.S. Supreme Court noted: Also in 1872, the Utah Bar admitted its first two women Phoebe Couzins and Georgianna Snow. In 1873, Belva Lockwood was admitted to the Washington, D.C., bar after a yearlong dispute. In 1878, Clara Shortridge Foltz became the first woman to be admitted to practice law in the state of California. To do so, she had to lobby the state legislature to remove the gender restriction in the law. Nonetheless, after her legislative success, she was still denied admission to the state's Hastings College of law on the grounds that women would \\"distract the attention of the male students.\\" Ms. Foltz only gained admission to the state school after arguing her case to the California Supreme Court. In Washington D.C., Belva Lockwood lobbied Congress on three separate occasions to change the U.S. Supreme Court admissions rules to allow a woman to argue before the court. Her efforts succeeded. Lockwood was sworn in as the first woman member of the U.S. Supreme Court bar on March 3, 1879. Late in 1880, she became the first woman lawyer to argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Even as women began to practice law, there were still few female judges. In 1884, the District of Columbia trial court appointed Marilla Ricker to the position of United States Commissioner. In 1886, the first woman to graduate from Pennsylvania Law School was appointed master in chancery for the city of Philadelphia. By 1907, Evanston, Illinois elected a woman, Catherine Waugh McCulloch to serve as a justice of the peace. Georgia Bullock's graduating law school class, 1912 In 1914, Georgia Bullock was appointed the \\"woman judge\\" of Los Angeles, in charge of a court segregated by sex where \\"she would serve as a model of Victorian ideals of womanhood for female misdemeanants.\\" Ratified in 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment granted women the right to vote. During this time, women began assuming judgeships, through both appointment and election. One such woman was Mary O'Toole, who became the first woman municipal judge of the United States, when she was appointed Judge of the Municipal Court of Washington, D.C. by President Harding in 1921. In 1925, the first female lawyer in California, Clara Shortridge Foltz, was considered for a federal judgeship at the age of 76. Florence Allen became both the first woman to be elected to the positions of general jurisdiction court in 1920 and the first female state appellate judge through her election to the Ohio Supreme Court in 1922. She later became the first female federal appellate judge, appointed to the 6th Circuit in 1933. The Los Angeles Women's Judge Georgia Bullock was finally appointed to an 'official' judgeship in 1931. The first female judge to serve on a federal district court, Burnita Shelton Matthews, was appointed in 1949 to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Barring women from practicing law was prohibited in the U.S. in 1971.http://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-ohio/nettie-and-florence-cronise- ohios-first-female-lawyers-honored-in-tiffin In 1975, Julia Cooper Mack was appointed to the D.C. Court of Appeals, making her the first woman of color, and only the eighth woman total, to be appointed to a court of last resort. By 1993, 60 women had served on the highest court in forty states, the District, and the federal courts. As of 2001, women comprised 26.3% of the judgeships on state courts of last resort, 19.2% of federal district court judgeships, 20.1% of federal appellate judgeships, and as of 2018, 33.3% of the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1981, Sandra Day O'Connor was the first woman appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. She received unanimous Senate approval. In 1982, she wrote the majority opinion in Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan. In 1992, O'Connor provided the vote needed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey to uphold the court's earlier decision. In 1999, O'Connor sided with the majority opinion in the sexual harassment case Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education that ruled the school board in question was indeed responsible for protecting a fifth-grade student from unwanted advances from another student. O'Connor retired from the court in 2006.http://www.biography.com/people/sandra-day- oconnor-9426834#life-after-the-supreme-court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, commenting on women pursuing careers, observed that \\"women professionals still have primary responsibility for the children and the housekeeping, spending roughly twice as much time on these cares as do their professional husbands.\\" Gender bias and barriers to entry in the US courts In the 1980s and 1990s, women began to experience an increase in their access the courts, as employees, judges, and court-users. This increase in access, along with a renewed interest in uncovering underlying discrimination, led many courts to consider the experience that women were having in the traditionally male- dominated court system. In the early 1980s the National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund and the National Association of Women Judges banded together to push the state and federal courts to review a perceived bias against women that they believed existed in the courts. From 1982 to 1984, the New Jersey Supreme Court created and ran the nation's first official Task Force on Women in the Courts to \\"investigate the extent to which gender bias exists in the New Jersey judicial branch, and to develop an education program to eliminate any such bias.\\" The task force found \\"significant gender bias,\\" prompting the New Jersey Chief Justice to order the task force to continue its work indefinitely. The New Jersey report garnered significant public attention and prompted other states to consider similar studies in their own judicial branches. At a 1988 joint meeting of the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators the participants formulated resolutions directing each chief justice to create a task force in his or her jurisdiction to study \\"gender bias and minority concerns.\\" This effort resulted in a comprehensive overview of issues impacting women in the various state judiciaries. Starting in 1992 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the federal judiciary followed suit and sought to investigate any gender bias that might exist in the courts and seek ways to remedy the problems. The progress made by these courts was almost terminated in 1995, when the new Republican majority that swept into Congress under the Contract with America sought to cut off funding that had been provided to run these task forces on the federal level. The new majority \\"believed that bias task forces by the federal judiciary were both unnecessary and undesirable.\\" However, the appropriation remained intact and tasks forces, such as Chief Judge Sloviter's Third Circuit Task Force, could continue to pursue their charters. Since 1992, women's representation in law school classes has approached 50%. However, the percentage of female federal judges is fairly lower. As of 2016, only 36% of judges on the federal courts of appeals were women, that is 60 out of 167 active judges. Women represented only 15% of judges on the Third Circuit, only 20% of judges on the Eight Circuit and only 25% of judges on the Tenth Circuit. As for women of color, there is even a smaller number. Only 12 women (7% of judges) of color were on the U.S. courts of appeals. In addition to other task forces, the Ninth Circuit's report found that many women believe that a major hindrance to attaining a judicial position is the lack of women \\"power players\\" in the connected \\"old boys clubs\\" that often influence judicial appointments. Women judges and women lawyers attribute male-domination of the judiciary in large part to the exclusion of women from the networks that influence judicial appointments. Women lawyers attribute the small number of women appointed to bench and bar committees to the exclusion of women from formal and informal selection processes. A large proportion of women lawyers believe that men have a better chance than women to be promoted to law firm partnerships and to equivalent positions in public law organizations. (See Sandra Day O'Connor, The Effects of Gender in the Federal Courts: The Final Report of the Ninth Circuit Gender Bias Task Force: The Quality of Justice, 67 S. Cal. L. Rev. 745, 786-87 (1994).) Inappropriate interactions Many of the task forces found both explicit and implicit unacceptable treatment of female lawyers by male judges. For instance, in 1988, \\"a senior status federal district court judge refused to address a female attorney as 'Ms.' and threatened to hold her in contempt if she persisted in using her birth name rather than her married name.\\" Women judges also report hearing more disparaging remarks than male judges do.

He was a member of the Uruguay national team and a plethora of clubs around the world. Club career Born in Montevideo, Sosa started his career in Danubio at the age of 15, being one of the youngest footballers to play in the Uruguayan First Division. He played for Danubio from 1982 to 1985, when he was transferred to Spain's Real Zaragoza. With this club, Ruben Sosa won the Copa del Rey in 1986, scoring in the final against FC Barcelona. After playing for Zaragoza, Ruben Sosa was transferred to Italy's S.S. Lazio, staying for four years before being sold to Internazionale, where he reached his greatest form as a football player. He was Inter's leading goal scorer in the 1992‚Äì93 and 1993‚Äì94 seasons, winning the UEFA Cup in 1994. However, the arrival of Dennis Bergkamp in the Summer of 1993, led to splits within the Inter camp, and as a result Sosa left Serie A in the summer of 1995. After years of success in Uruguay, Spain and Italy, Ruben Sosa played for Germany's Borussia Dortmund, winning the Bundesliga title in 1995‚Äì96. When he left Borussia Dortmund, he returned to Spain to play for CD Logro√±√©s. After a couple of months playing for the team, Ruben Sosa decided to leave in order to make his dream come true: he wanted to play for his favourite team in Uruguay, famous Nacional. At Nacional, Sosa won the Uruguayan League in 1998, 2000 and 2001, becoming one of the fans' heroes. In 2002, he left Nacional to play in China's Shanghai Shenhua. In 2003, Shanghai won the Chinese Jia-A League title, but the club was stripped of the title in 2013 for match fixing. In 2004, he returned to Nacional, this time as assistant coach, winning the 2005 league title. International career With the Uruguay national team, Sosa won the Copa Am√©rica in 1987 and 1995, and he played at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy; he also managed a runners-up medal at the 1989 Copa Am√©rica, where he was named the tournament's best player, and later took part at the 1993 Copa Am√©rica. Style of play Nicknamed El Principito (The Little Prince) by Uruguayan fans, Sosa was a quick, creative, talented, agile, and powerful left-footed forward, with good skills, control, and explosive acceleration. A diminutive footballer with a stocky physique, he was usually deployed as a second striker, although he was also capable of playing as a main striker, as he was capable of both scoring and creating goals. He was known in particular for his spectacular efforts and thunderous free kicks. A complete forward, who could shoot, volley, dribble, pass with precision, and hold up the ball to create chances for teammates, his attributes made him one of the best strikers in Europe during his prime. He is considered by many to be one of the best Uruguayan forwards of the last thirty years, alongside Luis Su√°rez, Enzo Francescoli, Carlos Aguilera, √Ålvaro Recoba, Daniel Fonseca, Diego Forl√°n, and Rub√©n Paz. Post-retirement Nowadays, Ruben Sosa works for Nacional as assistant coach, but he also played for a Second Division team in Uruguay, Racing Club de Montevideo in 2006.

He was the archivist of The Factory from 1964 to 1970.Celebrity Portraits from the Warhol Factory Years , exhibition and catalog from the Irvine Contemporary gallery, Washington, DC. His brief romance and subsequent friendship with Andy Warhol led to substantial collaboration on Warhol's work, including his films, paintings, and sculptures. Linich became Billy Name among the clique known as the Warhol Superstars. He was responsible for \\"silverizing\\" Warhol's New York studio, the Factory,Steven Watson, Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties (2003) Pantheon, New York, p. 123 where he lived until 1970. His photographs of the scene at the Factory and of Warhol are important documents of the pop art era.BILLY NAME‚ÄôS FACTORY PHOTOGRAPHS by Jessie Wender from the August 3, 2012 issue of The New Yorker Magazine, accessed 2017-06-06 In 2001, the United States Postal Service used one of Billy Name's portraits of Warhol when it issued a commemorative stamp of the artist. Name also collaborated with Shepard Fairey with his photograph of Nico, singer with the Velvet Underground and part of the social circle of Warhol's Factory. He photographed the covers for the Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat and their eponymous third album as well as the photographs in the gatefold sleeve for The Velvet Underground and Nico (in collaboration with fellow Warhol associate Nat Finkelstein). Career in theater The origin of Linich's assumption of his theatrical surname was explained this way: \\"He acquired his superstar identity. While he was filling in an official form, his pen hovered‚Ä¶ Name...Billy...He wrote. He had become Billy Name.\\" Before his association with Warhol, Name had worked in theatrical lighting design. Name began his career as a lighting designer in the theater in 1960 while working as a waiter at Serendipity 3, the mid-town dessert establishment.Steve Watson, Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties (Pantheon Books, 2003). His first apprenticeship was with Nick Cernovich, part of the Black Mountain College contingency in New York in the 1950s, who had won an Obie Award for best lighting. \\"It was the end of the period of the romantic avant-garde bohemia, when artists kept younger artists and a male artist would always have a young man around.\\" Under the tutelage of Cernovich, he co- designed the lighting for the Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds in 1960. Name later designed lighting at Judson Memorial Church, New York Poets Theater and the Living Theater, illuminating dancers such as Lucinda Childs, Yvonne Rainer, Merce Cunningham and Fred Herko. Name significantly influenced Warhol's work. Warhol later said: \\"[He] had a manner that inspired confidence. He gave the impression of being generally creative, he dabbled in lights and papers and artists materials...I picked up a lot from Billy.\\" (Warhol & Hackett,The Warhol Diaries) Name also played music in the group Theatre of Eternal Music under the direction of La Monte Young.Scherman, Tony & Dalton, David, POP: The Genius of Andy Warhol, HarperCollins, New York, N.Y. 2009, p. 188 Collaboration with Andy Warhol Name had met Warhol fleetingly at Serendipity 3, where he was a waiter, and then later through Ray Johnson, who brought Name to an event at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Johnson had attended Black Mountain College in the 1940s, and the younger Linich was a fan of that circle's pre-Beat, zen way of interacting with the world. Name met Warhol again when the collagist, pre-Pop and graphic artist Johnson brought Andy to one of Linich's haircutting parties in his East Village apartment and Warhol saw the place done up in silver foil and paint. According to Stephen Shore's Factory: Andy Warhol, \\"Andy and I were hanging around together. I had an apartment on the Lower East Side, where I had haircutting salons. Hundreds of people would come, and I‚Äôd be cutting someone's hair. Andy came. When he first started making films, he made films about what a person was famous for,\\" Billy, whose real name was William Linich Jr., and was the son of a barber, recalled. \\"I was famous for giving haircuts, so he said, \\"Would you let me do a film of you doing haircuts?\\" [Haircut, 1963] I had covered my entire apartment in silver foil and painted everything silver. Andy said \\"Well, I just got a new loft [the Factory]; would you do to it what you‚Äôve done to your apartment?\\" I said \\"Oh, sure, let's do it.\\" So, I started doing it. I was a technician‚Äî I‚Äôd been a light designer for [Manhattan dance theatre] the Judson Church. I also worked for some off-Broadway theater and avant-garde dance companies. I installed all the lighting at the Factory, all the sound systems.\\"\\"When Billy Name turned Warhol's Factory Silver\\" In return for making over his loft, Warhol gave Name a new role within the Factory. \\"I was into light and sound before, but not photography,\\" Name said. \\"Andy had a still camera, but he had gotten the Bolex. He was going to start to do films, and he gave me the Pentax and said \\"Here, Billy, you do the still photography; I‚Äôm going to start making films.\\" I became the in-house photographer and was sort of like the foreman. Eventually I moved in.\\" Name and Warhol eventually became lovers, but the romantic aspect of their relationship slowly dissolved into mutual loyalty and admiration. Name was responsible for taking still photographs at the Factory.Steven Watson, Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties (2003) Pantheon, New York, pp. 356-357 & 372-373. Name lived and worked at the Factory, having taken residence in a closet at the back of the studio at 231 East 47th Street. With the gift of Warhol's 35 mm single-lens reflex Honeywell Pentax camera, along with its operating manual, Name taught himself the technical aspects of photography. He converted one of the Factory bathrooms into a darkroom, where he learned to process film. This, combined with his background in lighting and experimental approach to his work, resulted in a body of work which captured the \\"silver years\\" at the Factory (1963‚Äì70).BILLY NAME‚ÄôS FACTORY PHOTOGRAPHS by Jessie Wender from the August 3, 2012 issue of The New Yorker Magazine, accessed 2017-06-06 Name's close friendship with Warhol - and his role in creating Warhol's artistic environment - provided him with a unique perspective of the Factory, with a particular focus on a core group of superstars, who largely improvised before the camera. Quotations about Name * \\"Billy Name exquisitely transforms sexploitation into glamour, and the 'nudie' into a work of beauty.\\" Debra Miller, on Name's stills from the 1967 Warhol film The Nude Restaurant. * \\"B. Linich is like a dog, a poodle --one does not have to have the same responsibilities towards him as towards other people--he is loved for the reasons a poodle is loved.\\" Soren AngenouxFactory Made: Warhold and the Sixties, Steve Watson, Pantheon Books (2003) * \\"Billy Linich arrived [at Diane di Prima's California home] the earliest and stayed the longest. Billy was at that time doing a bit of everything: writing, collaging, taking odd combinations of drugs, making mots that sounded way hipper than they probably were, and mostly looking wise with a little half-smile and crinkly eyes.\\" Diane di Prima Later life Name resided in his native Poughkeepsie, New York until his death in 2016. In 1994, he produced a short lived (5-8 episodes) cable television series The Bunka Krunka Show on TCI Cable Channel 32. He worked with Emmy Award-winning video editor Nicholas Apuzzo as well as film and video editor Nick Stamper. No known archive recordings exist.

In the 1950s a version written by Dominic Behan specifically referred to the execution of four members of the IRA Executive‚ÄîDubliner Rory O'Connor, who had commanded the Four Courts garrison at the outbreak of the Civil War, Galway Republican Liam Mellows, Cork republican Richard Barrett and Tyrone republican officer Joseph McKelvey. Their execution was a reprisal for the IRA's assassination on the previous day, 7 December 1922, of Sean Hales TD. The flag in question is the Irish tricolour, which the song tells supporters of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the Irish Free State to take down and cease using, as it is also the flag of the Irish Republic, which the \\"Free Staters\\" betrayed. At the time, the Anti- Treaty IRA regarded their Civil War opponents as traitors and therefore unworthy to use the Irish tricolour. Traditional lyrics You have murdered our brave Liam and Rory You have butchered young Richard and Joe And your hands with their blood are still gory Fulfilling the work of the foe. Refrain So take it down from the mast, Irish traitors, It's the flag we Republicans claim. It can never belong to Free Staters, For you've brought on it nothing but shame.

As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to construct such vessels, the ship was designed and built in the United Kingdom. She participated in the early stages of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, including the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war. Yashima was involved in subsequent operations until she struck two mines off Port Arthur in May 1904. She did not sink immediately, but capsized while under tow later that day. The Japanese were able to keep her loss a secret from the Russians for over a year. As a result, the Russians were unable to take advantage of the ship's loss. Background and description Right elevation and plan showing the internal layout of the ship The two Fuji-class ships were the IJN's first battleships, ordered from Britain in response to two new German- built Chinese ironclad warships.Lengerer 2008, pp. 23, 27 At this time, Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships and they had to be built abroad.Evans & Peattie, p. 60 The ships were designed by Philip WattsHeald, p. 208 as smaller versions of the British Royal Sovereign class, although they were slightly faster and had a better type of armour. The ships were long overall and had a beam of and a draught of at deep load. They normally displaced and had a crew of 650 officers and ratings.Brook 1999, p. 122 Unlike her sister ship , Yashima was fitted as an admiral's flagship.Lengerer 2009, p. 51 The ship was powered by two vertical triple- expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam generated by ten cylindrical boilers. The engines were rated at using forced draught and were designed to reach a top speed of , though Yashima reached a top speed of from on her sea trials.Lengerer 2008, p. 27 The sisters carried enough coal to allow them to steam for at a speed of .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 16 The main battery of the Fuji-class ships consisted of four guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Their secondary armament consisted of ten quick-firing (QF) guns, four mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and six mounted on the upper deck, protected by gun shields.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 221 Smaller guns were carried for defence against torpedo boats. These included fourteen QF 3-pounder () guns and ten 2.5-pounder Hotchkiss guns of the same calibre, all of which were in single mounts. The ships were also armed with five 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one above water in the bow and a submerged pair on each broadside. The Fuji class had a waterline armour belt that consisted of Harvey armour thick. Their gun turrets were protected by 6-inch armour plates and their decks were thick. In 1901, the ships exchanged 16 of their 47 mm guns for an equal number of QF 12-pounder () 12 cwt guns.\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. This raised the number of crewmen to 652 and later to 741. Construction and career Yashima under construction, about two months after her keel was laid down Given a classical name for Japan,Jane, p. 400 Yashima was ordered as part of the 1894 Naval Programme and the ship was laid down by Armstrong Whitworth at their Elswick shipyard on 6 December 1894 as yard number 625. The ship was launched on 28 February 1896Brook 1985, p. 268 and completed on 9 September 1897,Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 17 at a total cost of ¬•10,500,000.Lengerer 2008, p. 14 She conducted her sea trials during the following month. Yashima departed the UK on 15 September and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 30 November. She was initially assigned to the Standing Fleet, the IJN's primary combat fleet, but was reduced to reserve on 20 November. The ship was reclassified as a first- class battleship on 21 March 1898 and reassigned to the Standing Fleet. Two years later, Yashima was again placed in reserve where she remained until reactivated on 28 December 1903 and assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet of the Combined Fleet. At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Yashima, commanded by Captain Hajime Sakamoto, participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Vice-Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç led his battleships and cruisers in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. T≈çg≈ç had expected the preceding surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganised and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for the attack of the battleships and cruisers. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. T≈çg≈ç chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only 17, while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before T≈çg≈ç disengaged. Yashima was not hit during the battle.Forczyk, pp. 41‚Äì44 alt=Black and white image of a white-painted warship On 10 March, Yashima and her sister Fuji, under the command of Rear-Admiral Nashiba Tokioki, blindly bombarded the harbour of Port Arthur from Pigeon Bay, on the south west side of the Liaodong Peninsula, at a range of . They fired 154 twelve-inch shells,Forczyk, p. 44 but did little damage.Brook 1985, p. 269 When they tried again on 22 March, they were attacked by Russian coast-defence guns that had been transferred there by the new Russian commander, Vice-Admiral Stepan Makarov, and also from several Russian ships in Port Arthur using observers overlooking Pigeon Bay. The Japanese ships disengaged after Fuji was hit by a twelve-inch shell. Yashima participated in the action of 13 April when T≈çg≈ç successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Makarov's flagship, the battleship . When Makarov spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division, he turned back for Port Arthur and Petropavlovsk struck a mine laid by the Japanese the previous night. The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, T≈çg≈ç resumed long-range bombardment missions, which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields.Forczyk, pp. 45‚Äì46 A model of Yashima in the British alt=A large brass and wood warship On 14 May, Nashiba put to sea with his flagship Hatsuse and two other battleships, , and Yashima, the protected cruiser Kasagi, and the dispatch boat to relieve the Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur.Warner & Warner, p. 279 On the following morning, the squadron encountered a minefield laid by the Russian minelayer Amur. Hatsuse struck one mine that disabled her steeringForczyk, p. 46 around 11:10 and Yashima struck two others when moving to assist Hatsuse. One blew a hole in her starboard aft boiler room and the other detonated on the starboard forward side of her hull, near the underwater torpedo room. After the second detonation the ship had a 9¬∞ list to starboard that gradually increased throughout the day. Yashima was towed away from the minefield, north towards the Japanese base in the Elliott Islands. She was still taking on water at an uncontrollable rate, and Sakamoto ordered the ship anchored around 17:00 near Encounter Rock to allow the crew to easily abandon ship. He assembled the crew, which sang the Japanese national anthem, Kimigayo, and then abandoned ship. Kasagi took Yashima in tow, but the battleship's list continued to increase, and she capsized about three hours later, after the cruiser was forced to cast off the tow,Warner & Warner, pp. 279‚Äì282 roughly at co-ordinates . The Japanese were able to conceal her loss for more than a year as no Russians observed Yashima sink.Warner & Warner, pp. 283, 332 As part of the deception, for the rest of the war the surviving crewmen were assigned to four auxiliary gunboats that were tasked to guard Port Arthur and addressed their letters as if they were still aboard the battleship.

She was a pioneer of Pakistani literature and journalism in English, and also a pioneer of feminism in Pakistan. She was Pakistan's first female columnist (in English), editor, publisher and political commentator. Zaibunnisa Street in Karachi was named after her. Before independence in 1947, she wrote for many Indian newspapers, and was the first Muslim woman to write a column in an Indian newspaper. After independence, her column in the newspaper Dawn made her the first female political commentator in Pakistan. After she left Dawn, she became the founder and editor-publisher of the Mirror, the first social glossy magazine in Pakistan. Due to her status as Pakistan's first female editor, she became the first woman to be included in press delegations sent to other countries. On one of these delegations, in 1955, she became the first woman to speak at the ancient al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. Early life Zeb-un-Nissa Ali was born in 1921 to a literary family in Calcutta. Her father, S. Wajid Ali, was the first person to translate the writings of the well-known Urdu poet Muhammad Iqbal into Bengali, and was an avid Bengali and Indian nationalist and writer. She had two brothers, and one half-brother from her mother's second marriage. She grew up in a tightly-knit Anglo-Indian household filled with Bengali thinkers and philosophers of the age, as her father's house at 48, Jhowtalla Road, was something of a meeting place for the Calcutta literary circle. She started to write at an early age, and received considerable support from both her English mother and Bengali father. A lonely child, Zeb-un-Nissa took to writing poetry as a means to express her thoughts and emotions. Her later writing was affected by her trips to rural areas of Bengal and the Punjab, including her father's birthplace, the Bengali village of Tajpur. She was educated at the Loreto House Convent. Marriage Zeb-un- Nissa Hamidullah, just after her marriage. In 1940, she married Khalifa Muhammad Hamidullah. Unlike most marriages of the time, hers was not an arranged marriage. She moved with him to the Punjab, Pakistan after their marriage. He worked there as an executive for the Bata shoe company. During independence in 1947, she and her husband helped refugees coming across the border from India. Her husband, belonged to a well-known Punjabi family. His father, Khalifa Mohammad Asadullah, was the librarian of the Imperial Library in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Hamidullah was the head of Bata's operations in Pakistan, and was sent to head Bata in Ireland in 1972. All of her books were dedicated to him, proof of their devotion to one another. They had two children: Nilofar (b. 1943) and Yasmine (b. 1949). After moving to the Punjab in 1942, Begum Hamidullah was shocked. Raised in an Anglo-Indian household, she found it hard to adjust to the very different lifestyle of her husband's large Punjabi family. It took time for her to adjust, as she admitted in the foreword to The Young Wife. Career=1936‚Äì1943 Begum Hamidullah first came into prominence in 1936, when a poem of hers was accepted for publication by Bombay's Illustrated Weekly of India. From then on, she was a regular contributor to that newspaper, until independence in 1947. In 1943, her first book of poetry, Indian Bouquet, was published by her father's publishing house and proved to be very popular. All copies of the first edition were sold in three months. She followed up on her early success with Lotus Leaves, another book of poetry. 1944‚Äì1946 In 1945, Begum Hamidullah and her husband were in Simla at the time of the Simla Conference. It was here that she met Fatima Jinnah. They became friends, and Jinnah soon managed to get her an exclusive interview with her brother, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. This was a landmark in the young Begum Hamidullah's career, and it brought her India-wide fame. Her stories, poems and articles also began to bring her more fame around this time. 1947‚Äì1951 After independence in 1947, Begum Hamidullah decided to work in the field of journalism, and soon established herself as an outspoken writer in her column \\"Thru a Woman's Eyes\\", in the Karachi daily newspaper Dawn. This column began in December 1947. After some time, she rebelled against the limited scope of the feature, declaring that women should have the right to comment on every subject, including politics. Altaf Husain, then editor of Dawn, eventually agreed to give her a wider scope. He recognised the merit of her work by giving her a new assignment ‚Äì that of a columnist appearing on the editorial page. Begum Hamidullah became the first female political commentator of Pakistan. Her column established her reputation as an honest columnist who was not afraid to voice her opinions. It was also a huge step for the women's rights movement in Pakistan. 1951‚Äì1956 In 1951, she left Dawn, after editor Altaf Husain demanded that she focus her writing on \\"issues relating to women,\\" an apparent reference to an earlier message in which he suggested she write about \\"cooking, child-rearing, and other matters of feminine concern.\\" Hamidullah founded a monthly magazine called the Mirror, and became its editor and publisher in 1952. She became a businesswoman as well as the first female editor and publisher in the nation. Her glossy social pictorial, with its courageous and sincere editorials, was an instant success. The Mirror became very popular, and Begum Hamidullah soon became quite famous as a journalist and editor. The Pakistani government included her in numerous press delegations during this period. She was one of the founding members of the Pakistani Working Women's Association, as well as a close friend of Fatima Jinnah, sister of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, and Begum Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan, wife of Pakistan's first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan. Some of her other close friends were: Hakim Said, Salima Ahmed, Ardeshir Cowasjee, Syed Hashim Raza, Shaista Ikramullah, and Jahanara Habibullah. She was a founder member of the Karachi branch of Business and Professional Women's Foundation, and served as its first chapter-president. She held this position for two consecutive terms. She was also the first president of the Women's International Club of Karachi, a member of the Horticultural Society, and first woman-president of the Flower Show Committee. Another organisation Hamidullah played an important role in was the All Pakistan Women's Association, founded by her friend Begum Raana Liaquat Ali Khan. In 1955, as part of a press delegation to Cairo, she became the first woman to speak at the ancient Al-Azhar University. Her speech was controversial, as she discussed Pakistan's Kashmir issue. However, it was a great distinction for her. In 1956, Begum Hamidullah wrote a travelogue entitled Sixty Days in America, about her trip to the US as part of a World Leaders Program, during which she befriended people like Marilyn Monroe and Jean Negulesco, and appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. This travelogue consisted of columns she had written for a newspaper, The Times of Karachi, during her trip. The editor, ZA Suleri, gave her permission to reprint the columns in book form as a travelogue which she did. The following year, she represented Pakistan at the United Nations sponsored seminar on Civic Responsibilities and Increased Participation of Asian Women in Public Life. Ban on the Mirror In 1957, her outspoken criticism of the harsh regime of Major-General Iskander Mirza, and the forced resignation of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, culminated in a six-month government ban on the Mirror, issued on 9 November. This ban, she was privately informed, would be withdrawn if she publicly apologised. She refused to do this and, on the advice of the well- known lawyer A.K. Brohi, appealed to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. After Brohi's intervention on her behalf, the Supreme Court passed judgement in her favour. Holding the order of the Central Government illegal and unconstitutional, the government awarded her the costs of petition to Begum Hamidullah. This incident made journalistic history, and gave her the distinction of being the first woman journalist to have won a case in the Supreme Court. 1958‚Äì1961 In 1958, she published an anthology of her short stories, The Young Wife and Other Stories, which was so popular that second and third editions were printed in 1971 and 1987 respectively. Eminent critics, from newspapers and periodicals both Pakistani and foreign, called some of the stories in it \\"...the most significant literary productions of Pakistan\\". It was during this period that her editorials started to become a major feature of the Mirror, and this increased the popularity of both her and her magazine. In April 1961, Begum Hamidullah opened her own publishing house: Mirror Press. Mirror Press, and its subsidiary, Mirror Publications, were charged with printing the Mirror from 1961 onwards. They also did other jobs, but the publishing house remained small. The 1960s The Mirror became a highly controversial magazine in the '60s, mainly due to Begum Hamidullah's editorials, which were highly critical of the government's authoritarian form of rule. As her magazine became and more and more risqu√©, Begum Hamidullah began to feel that she and her family could soon be in danger. Highly critical of Ayub Khan and his government, Begum Hamidullah dropped out of governmental favour. As such, the Mirror lost government advertisements and patronage. During this period, she wrote a series of very critical editorials about Ayub Khan's style of government, starting with \\"Please, Mr. President!\\", a very emotional open letter in which she pleaded with him to stop ordering the police to harm students taking part in demonstrations. After Khan replied to the first editorial with a letter in which he dismissed Begum Hamidullah as \\"rashly emotional\\", the tension steadily increased. The Mirror came close to being banned many times, and was actually banned twice. However, this period of her career came to a climax in the February 1969 edition of the Mirror, in which she published both \\"Please Mr. President!\\" and a new editorial, \\"No, thank you, Sir!\\". She claimed that the situation had not improved and that \\"Pakistanis from Peshawar to Chittagong are crying 'out with Ayub!'\\". Ayub Khan soon abdicated, ironically doing exactly what she had advised him to do. However, she continued to write critical editorials whenever she felt the government was in need of a rebuke. 1969‚Äì1971 Begum Hamidullah was Deputy Leader of the Pakistani delegation to the United Nations General Assembly from 1970 to 1971. In 1971, after civil unrest and the subsequent independence of Bangladesh, Begum Hamidullah sent a telegram congratulating the new government but chose to remain in Pakistan. In 1971, Begum Hamidullah's husband was transferred to Ireland, to head Bata operations there. As neither of her two daughters was willing to take over the magazine, she closed it down, and sold off her publishing house, Mirror Press. 1971‚Äì1979 For most of the 1970s, she and her husband lived in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been transferred. Zaib-un-Nissa put her career on hold to be with her husband, and visited Pakistan regularly. She returned near the end of the decade and began writing a column entitled \\"Thinking Aloud\\" for the Pakistani magazine MAG, part of the large Jang Group. 1980‚Äì1983 In the early 1980s, she served as president of the All Pakistan Women's Association (APWA), an organisation she had played a major role in since its inception. Still writing columns for the Morning News of Karachi, she continued to comment on the socio-political aspects of Pakistani society. However, she was becoming increasingly reclusive. Retirement In 1983, Begum Hamidullah husband had a heart attack, and he died the next year. On the day of his funeral, she wrote what was to become the most famous article of her later career. This introspective piece was published in the Morning News the day after her husband's death. She was plunged into sadness following her husband's death, and soon retired from an active writing life. Disenchanted with the new generation of Pakistanis, Begum Hamidullah fell into seclusion and soon moved in with her daughter, choosing to spend her remaining years with her family. She retired from an active career, and only wrote occasional articles during the 1980s. In 1987, however, she was plunged into the public eye once again, when her book of short stories, The Young Wife and Other Stories, was republished due to popular demand. Yet this late fame did not last very long, and she soon went back into seclusion. Death Begum Hamidullah died on 10 September 2000, at the age of 81. She had been rushed to the hospital on the 9th, but died in the early hours of the 10th, due to water in her lungs. An obituary in Dawn newspaper said \\"even her detractors admired her for the courage of conviction and the strength of character she displayed throughout her life.\\" Another newspaper obituary said \\"She will be long remembered for her pioneering role in a certain genre of journalism in Pakistan, and as a powerful and courageous writer.\\" In the 1960s, the government named a major street in the Karachi city centre after her: Zaibunnisa Street.This week 50 years ago: Parking on Elphinstone Street made punishable Dawn (newspaper), Updated 18 January 2016. Retrieved 9 April 2018 Legacy After Begum Hamidullah's death, her copyright passed to her younger daughter, Yasmine S. Ahmed. This included the right to all her pictures, works, etc. Due to popular demand, a fourth edition of The Young Wife and Other Stories was published by Oxford University Press, Pakistan in August 2008. Zaib-un-Nissa or Zeb-un-Nissa? There has been much confusion about the correct spelling of Begum Hamidullah's name. She was originally named Zeb-un-Nissa after the Mughal Princess Zeb-un-Nissa, and kept this spelling of her name throughout most of her life. However, there was much confusion, as, due to the pronunciation, most people thought her name was spelt Zaib-un-Nissa. In 1970, when the government named Zaibunnisa Street in her honour, she changed the spelling of her name permanently to Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah. This has become the more common and accepted spelling of her name, and is the spelling most widely used today. However, most readers of the Mirror still remember her as Zeb-un-Nissa Hamidullah, as that was how she was credited in the magazine. In latter anthologies, like A Dragonfly in the Sun by Muneeza Shamsie, she was credited as Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah. Even though the first part of her name is now accepted as 'Zaib', there is still some confusion, with various transliterations popping up. Zaibunnisa, Zaibunnissa, Zaibunissa and Zaibunisa are the most common errors.

The tegmentum is the ventral part of the midbrain and the tectum is the dorsal part of the midbrain. It is located between the ventricular system and distinctive basal or ventral structures at each level. It forms the floor of the midbrain (mesencephalon) whereas the tectum forms the ceiling.It is a multisynaptic network of neurons that is involved in many subconscious homeostatic and reflexive pathways. It is a motor center that relays inhibitory signals to the thalamus and basal nuclei preventing unwanted body movement. The tegmentum area includes various different structures, such as the rostral (=frontal/cranial/oral) end of the reticular formation, several nuclei controlling eye movements, the periaqueductal gray matter, the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, and the ventral tegmental area. The tegmentum is the location of several cranial nerve (CN) nuclei. The nuclei of CN III and IV are located in the tegmentum portion of the midbrain. The nuclei of CN V to VIII are located in the tegmentum at the level of the pons. The nuclei of CN IX, X, and XII are located in that of the medulla. Development In embryos, the tegmentum is the anterior half of the neural tube. However, for fetuses to adults, tegmentum refers only to the parts of the brain that remain relatively unchanged after development is complete, i.e. at the brain stem especially the midbrain. Other parts, on the other hand, develop further, through folding and thickening, and have different names. Still, it is considered a continuous central region through all levels of the brainstem. Structures that develop to grow ventral or lateral outside this primitive tube as add-ons (e.g., the crus cerebri in the anterior of the midbrain) are not considered part of the tegmentum, as they are not part of the primitive neural tube but grow as projections from the cerebral cortex. However, parts that were inside the primitive neural tube and remained an integral part of it after complete development (e.g., the red nucleus) are considered part of the tegmentum. Divisions The tegmentum forms distinguished divisions in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Midbrain tegmentum The midbrain tegmentum is the part of the midbrain extending from the substantia nigra to the cerebral aqueduct in a horizontal section of the midbrain. Structures included in the midbrain tegmentum include the red nucleus, reticular formation, and substantia nigra. The red nucleus is responsible for controlling basic body and limb movements. The reticular formation controls arousal and self-consciousness, and the [substantia nigra] integrates voluntary movements.Klein, S & Thorne, B. \\"Biological Psychology\\" Worth Publishers, 2007. p.55 Pontine tegmentumLateral tegmental field The lateral tegmental field (LTF) or lateral tegmentum (more specifically the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the solitary nucleus) is the source of several neural pathways in the brain's noradrenaline system.

A fill flash on the camera adds the required uniform illumination to the areas shaded from the sun. In lighting design, backlighting is the process of illuminating the subject from the back. In other words, the lighting instrument and the viewer face each other, with the subject in between. This creates a glowing effect on the edges of the subject, while other areas are darker. The backlight can be a natural or artificial source of light. When artificial, the back light is usually placed directly behind the subject in a 4-point lighting setup. A back light, which lights foreground elements from the rear, is not to be confused with a background light, which lights background elements (such as scenery). In the context of lighting design, the back light is sometimes called hair or shoulder light, because when lighting an actor or an actress, backlighting makes the edges the subject's hair glow if the hair is fuzzy. This can create an angelic halo type effect around the head. Filmmakers sometimes use this to show that the actor is good or pure. Television productions often use this effect in soap operas, where it has become something of a clich√© of the genre. It is also sometimes called the kicker or rim light. Backlighting helps separate the subject and the background. Live theatre lighting designs often use backlighting to give a more three- dimensional appearance to actors or set elements, when front lighting alone would give a flat, two-dimensional look. In chiaroscuro effects in painting, such as the candlelit paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby (illustration), backlighting helps separate subjects in the foreground and emphasizes depth. In photography, a back light (often the sun) that is about sixteen times more intense than the key light produces a silhouette. A fill flash used with a backlit subject yields more even lighting. The vertical angle of the back light can change the effect. A low angle can make the light hit the camera lens, causing lens flare. A high angle can make the subject's nose extend out from the mostly vertical shadow of the head, producing a potentially unwanted highlight in the middle of the face.

Life His story is told by Eusebius of C√¶sarea.Eusebius, Church History, VII.11, VII.32. As a deacon at Alexandria he had accompanied his bishop, Dionysius (with a priest, two other deacons and two Romans who were then in Egypt) before the tribunal of √Ümilian, Prefect of Egypt, at the time of Emperor Valerianus (253-260). Dionysius tells the story of their trials in a letter to a certain Bishop Germanus.Eusebius, Church History, VII.11. They were all sentenced to banishment, but Eusebius managed to remain in the city in hiding, \\"zealously served the confessors in prison and buried the bodies of the dead and the blessed martyrs, not without danger to his own life\\". In 260 there broke out a rebellion at Alexandria and at the same time a plague ravaged the city. Eusebius again risked his life continually by nursing the sick and the wounded.Eusebius, Church History, VII, xxxii. The Romans besieged a part of the town (Bruchium, Pyroucheion, Prouchion). Anatolius, Eusebius' friend, was among the besieged, Eusebius himself outside. Eusebius went to the Roman general and asked him to allow any who would to leave Bruchium. His petition was granted and Anatolius, with whom he managed to communicate, explained the matter to the leaders of the rebellion and implored them to capitulate. They refused but eventually allowed the women, children, and old men to profit by the Romans' mercy. A great crowd then came to surrender at the Roman camp. \\"Eusebius there nursed all who were exhausted by the long siege with every care and attention as a father and physician.\\"Eusebius, Church History, xxxii. In 264 Dionysius (who seems to have come back from banishment) sent Eusebius as his delegate to Syria to represent him at the discussions that were taking place concerning the affair of Paul of Samosata. Anatolius accompanied his friend. The Syrians were so impressed by these two Egyptians that they kept them both and made Eusebius Bishop of Laodicea as successor to Socrates. Not long afterwards he died and was succeeded by Anatolius. The date of his death is uncertain. Adolf Harnack thinks it was before the major Synod of Antioch in 268.Adolf Harnack, Chron. Der altchristl. Litt., I, 43. Another theory is that the siege of Alexandria was in 269, that the friends went to Syria at the end of that year, and that Eusebius's death was not until 279.So William Reading in the Variorum notes to his edition of Eusebius Pamphilus, Cambridge 1720, I 367.

The term is a Dutch compound, with land meaning ‚Äúregion‚Äù and drost, from Middle Dutch drossƒÅte (droes-state, bloke-castle, state-holder) which originally referred to a lord‚Äôs chief retainer (who later became the medieval seneschal or steward), equivalent to: * an English reeve or steward; * a Low German Drost(e) of Northern Germany (cognate with German Truchsess); or * German Meier (from Latin majordomus). Feudal era Originally, a drost in the Low Countries ‚Äì where various titles were in use for similar offices ‚Äì was essentially a steward or seneschal under the local lord, exercising various functions depending on the endlessly varied local customary law, e.g. tax collection, policing, prosecution, and carrying out sentences. In many Lower Rhenish and Westphalian and Lower Saxon estates of the Holy Roman Empire the term Landdrost or Drost(e) described the chief executive official of a military, jurisdictional and/or police ambit, representing his lord-paramount of the territory, therefore often appearing with the affix 'land-'. Among the many territories using the term were the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, the Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim, the County of Mark, and the Duchy of Mecklenburg. South Africa The office was also introduced in the Dutch colony established at the Cape of Good Hope. The first was appointed in Stellenbosch, and further landdrosts were appointed as new districts were proclaimed: Drakenstein (Paarl), Swartland (Malmesbury), Tulbagh, Swellendam, Graaff-Reinet and Uitenhage. Under the British, new districts were created at George and Grahamstown (Albany district), while Lord Charles Somerset moved the seat of the Tulbagh district to the new town of Worcester. It came to more gubernatorial significance in some of the Boer polities that seceded after the British took over the colony, notably: *Graaff-Reinet had only one ‚Äúnational‚Äù landdrost (appointed by the revolutionary r√©gime that regarded itself as being part of the [French revolutionary] Dutch republic), 6 February 1795 ‚Äì 22 August 1796: Friedrich Carl David Gerotz (1739‚Äì1828) *The Republic of Natalia appointed three landdrosts: one in Pietermaritzburg (Jacobus Nicolaas Boshof), one in Durban (an English trader) and one in Winburg. *The Utrecht Republic had three consecutive landdrosts: **1852 ‚Äì 1855: Andreas Theodorus Spies (1800‚Äì1889), who was already in office before the settlement declared itself a republic **1855 ‚Äì February 1856: J.C. Steyn **February 1856 ‚Äì 8 May 1858: Andreas Theodorus Spies (2nd time) A similar gubernatorial role in other Boer polities was played by officials styled Kaptyn ('captain', in the original sense of Headman). Civil Commissioners, magistrates In the Cape Colony, an ordinance passed in 1827 abolished the old Dutch ‚Äúlanddrost‚Äù and courts of heemraden, instead substituting British-type resident magistrates, who would act only in English. Most of the Cape‚Äôs magistrates were also civil commissioners, in charge of civil divisions ‚Äì the Cape Peninsula was a single division (the Cape division) with three magisterial districts: Cape Town, Wynberg and Simon‚Äôs Town. In the Boer republics, each proclaimed district had a landdrost. With the annexation of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State during the Boer War, the office fell away, the landdrosts being replaced by British-style magistrates.

No ISBN On 1 April 1885 the terms were replaced in Hanover by the terms Regierungsbezirk (governorate) and Regierungspr√§sident (gubernator).  Post-World War II Dutch-occupied Germany After World War II, the old landdrost title was re-used for two extraordinary jurisdictions within the Dutch Occupation Zone in Germany. On 22 March 1949, the Allies agreed to let the Netherlands occupy and annex some German border territories. These included the municipalities of Havert, Hillensberg, Millen, S√ºsterseel, T√ºddern (Dutch: Tudderen), Wehr, parts of H√∂ngen, Gangelt, Schumm, Saeffelen as well as Elten and Hoch-Elten. The Dutch annexation effectively started on 23 April that year, with the following two jurisdictions declared: *Landdrost of Tudderen (T√ºddern in German) (directly subordinated to the Dutch government up to September 1951, then to the Governor of Dutch Limburg province): 1949 ‚Äì 1963 Hubert M.J.

Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders  After the creation of the Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders, now part of the province of Flevoland, the newly claimed area was governed by the landdrost of the Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders (Public Body of the Southern IJsselmeer Polders) until it was partitioned into municipalities.

At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Hatsuse, commanded by Captain Yu Nakao, was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet and became the flagship of its commander, Rear-Admiral Nashiba Tokioki. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Vice-Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. T≈çg≈ç had expected his surprise night attack on the Russians by his destroyers to be much more successful than it actually was and anticipated that they would be badly disorganised and weakened, but the Russians had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the cruiser which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. T≈çg≈ç chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a bad idea as the Japanese and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships who concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although a large number of ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only 17 while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before T≈çg≈ç disengaged. Hatsuse was hit twice during the battle, losing seven crewmen killed and seventeen wounded.Forczyk, pp. 41‚Äì44 Hatsuse at sea Hatsuse participated in the action of 13 April when T≈çg≈ç successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice-Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, the battleship .

The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, Makarov one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, T≈çg≈ç resumed long-range bombardment missions, which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields.Forczyk, pp. 45‚Äì46 On 14 May Nashiba put to sea with the battleships Hatsuse, , and , the protected cruiser , and the dispatch boat to relieve the Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur.Warner & Warner, p. 279 On the following morning, the squadron encountered a minefield laid by the Russian minelayer Amur.

The album was released on July 6, 1987. The first three tracks all handle the topic of world politics, and ponder the role of the United States in the world. \\"Long Walk Home,\\" for example, empathizes with troops under deployment overseas. Though in response to the foreign policy issues of the time (Beirut, Qaddafi), Young found new meaning in these songs in the context of the war on terror and the occupation of Iraq. During his \\"Freedom of Speech\\" tour in support of Living with War, Young posted videos of these three songs on his website.

Finally, riots broke out among the unemployed who condemned city leaders for their ineffective relief measures.Cleveland: A Concise History, 1796-1996 by Carol Poh Miller and Robert Anthony Wheeler According to the New York Times, \\"[t]he desire to stop work seemed to take possession of every laborer...\\" on May Day of 1894. Background May Day, or International Workers' Day was a day for remembering the workers who died during the Haymarket affair of 1886. During a General Strike in Chicago, Illinois, an unknown person threw a bomb into the crowd, prompting police to fire into the crowd, killing civilians and police alike. The same day in 1890, Raymond Lavigne called for international demonstrations to commemorate the day. In 1894 the Pullman Strike in Illinois, as well as this series of unemployed workers' riots on May Day in Cleveland, prompted U.S. President Grover Cleveland to propose a bill that would make a Labor Day a national public holiday.\\"Labor Day.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

After the Haymarket Square riot in May, 1886, US President Grover Cleveland feared that commemorating Labor Day on May 1 could become an opportunity to commemorate the riots.\\"Why Did May Day Turn Into Riot Day?\\" SodaHead.com. Web. . May Day celebrations have diminished in the United States, because of the creation of Labor Day. Causes One of the major causes of the riots was the Panic of 1893. The panic precipitated one of the most severe depressions in American History. The closure of two major railroads and other major companies triggered a stock market collapse. The New York banks had heavily invested in the stock market, and bank failures soon began. This caused a contraction of credit, and many other, newer, businesses started to shut down as well. The depression produced widespread social unrest, mostly among the now-unemployed workers. Some people tried to create public works programs for the unemployed, but this was unsuccessful.Brinkley, Alan. \\"The Panic of 1893.\\" The Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People.

Web. The Red Scare followed soon after the riots. Effects The riots of 1894, along with the Haymarket Affair, brought about a series of discussions about the workforce in America and the depression. In 1904, the International Socialist Conference meeting in Amsterdam called on \\"all Social Democratic Party organizations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on May First for the legal establishment of the 8-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace.\\" The congress made it \\"mandatory upon the proletarian organizations of all countries to stop work on May 1, wherever it is possible without injury to the workers.\\"\\"May Day.\\" Socialphy.

The mob marched through the manufacturing district of the city, called \\"The Flats\\" armed with clubs and stones. Much property was destroyed, but they were ultimately taken down by the police. Men with flags shouted to the crowd to encourage them to join the riots, but only about a dozen boys joined them. The square was abandoned as the mob marched on. The crowd was \\"hooting and jeering those who didn't join them.\\" They then attacked firemen, believing they were police. The firemen held their ground as clubs flew. They soon met up with the leader of the mob, who encouraged them to keep peace; he was ignored. They entered the foundry department, where workmen were forced to halt. One man attempted to restart his work, but was held by mob members while others fled from the building. Shops were closed and barred, while employees fled Mobmen all ran at the Standard Paint Works with the cry \\"Victory!\\" The workers of the shop joined the ranks of the men in their attack of the Upson Nut Works. People threw coal at the shop, breaking windows and knocking down workers before they had the chance to retreat. Many men on the inside of the factory were injured in the raid. The coal-throwing stopped as the mob rushed the gates. This slight resistance made the mob take \\"vengeance by tearing the doors and gates to pieces.\\" The men then took complete possession over the building, and workers fled in terror. Everything breakable in the shop was destroyed. They left the destroyed shop and went down the railroad tracks to the main office of the company. The police came, which deterred the mob for a short period of time. They took over the coal carts and used them as barriers as they surrounded the police; they threw stones at them. Some of the rioters were scared by the presence of the police, and fled. The crowd of 5 000 \\"dwindled to half that number.\\" The leaders of the riot planned an attack on the Faulhaber Furniture Company; but the police stopped them before there could be a repeat of the event at the Upson factory. The police grew to such numbers that they \\"presented a formidable appearance.\\" They dispersed the rioters and arrested their leader, Tom Moore. The eastern part of the city was little better off. A throng of 200 Italians marched through the streets armed with clubs, iron and wire rods, and gate posts. At Gates's quarry there were speeches and threats; workers dropped their tools and joined them. The same speeches and threats were made at Neff's quarry, and more men joined. At Reader's quarry, there was little opposition. They broke into boarding houses and compelled more to join them. The Mayor urged the people not to riot, and called for police forces to be assembled. The stated that the city would use every power to maintain law and order. Armories were prepared for discharge at the mayor's order. Another mob forced the workers of the United Salt Company out. They proceeded to the Cleveland Rolling Mills where they met by the police. After several minutes of serious clubbing, the mob dispersed in every direction. Seven men, all with broken heads, were arrested. Policemen were stationed in the public square to prevent any gathering there. There was also considerable fear that the rioters would gather the dynamite used by the railroad companies to blow up factories and private residences; however, there is no evidence that they did so.

The organisation's main areas of operation are within the United Kingdom and its territorial waters; however, the organisation is often requested to provide assistance and training in marine mammal rescue by international governments and charitable organisations due to their vast wealth of knowledge, experience and available equipment. BDMLR has developed an internationally renowned Marine Mammal Medic training program and has trained over 17,000 medics worldwide. To complement the Marine Mammal Medic training program BDMLR has also produced a Marine Mammal Medic handbook (currently on its 8th edition), that is used globally by various governmental and non- governmental organisations to deal with stranded cetaceans. The organisation specialises primarily in pinniped (seals) and cetacean (porpoises, dolphins and whales) rescue, however will responded to stranded sea turtles, basking sharks, otters, injured or oiled sea birds and entangled marine mammals. In 2008 BDMLR received specialised training from the Provincetown Centre for Coastal Studies (PCCS) in Maine in the United States of America, on how to rescue entangled large free swimming whales, and in 2013 after developing these techniques specifically for British waters formed the British Divers Marine Life Rescue - Large Whale Disentanglement Team (BDMLR ‚Äì LWDT) made up entirely of trained volunteers ready to respond to entangled cetaceans in British and European waters. Northern bottle-nosed whale in London in January 2006 The organisation was the subject of widespread media coverage in January 2006 due to its efforts in leading the attempted rescue of a northern bottle-nosed whale (the \\"River Thames whale\\") which became disorientated and distressed after swimming up the River Thames into central London. A large rescue operation began on the morning of Saturday 21 January and lasted until the evening when the whale died. In more recent years amongst the hundreds of call out each year attended by BDMLR, the organisation spearheaded the major rescue efforts that were launched to save either mass stranded Pilot whales or pilot whales in danger of mass stranding at Loch Carnan in South Uist on the Outer Hebrides of Scotland in 2010, once again at Loch Carnan in South Uist on the Outer Hebrides of Scotland in 2011, at the Kyle of Durness on the North West Corner of the Highlands of Scotland in 2011, at Pittenweem in Fife on the East Coast of Scotland in 2012, at Portmahomack and Dornoch Point on the East Coast of the Highlands of Scotland in 2013 and Staffin Island on the West Coast of Scotland in 2015. In 2018, the BDMLR also took part in sighting Benny, a Beluga whale who had been sighted foraging in the Thames Estuary.  Operation Nettie  In August 2015 BDMLR was contact by the Centre for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Maine in the US to assist as part of the global response network for large whale disentanglement as member of the Atlantic Large Whale Disentanglement Network (ALWDN) to a Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Iceland that was entangled in fisheries debris at the time suspected and later confirmed to be monofilament netting panels and lead weighted line from a Gill net array. This was following requests from local whale watching companies and NGO's following a failed but valiant attempts by local Coast Guard personnel to free the free swimming but fatally entangled creature. Several days of anxiety passed following the initial call for help whilst BDMLR through the International Whaling Commission (IWC) sought permission from the pro whaling Icelandic government to allow an international rescue team to come to the aid of the whale on welfare grounds due to the undoubted amount of suffering that the animal was experiencing and the prolonged agony and certain death that awaited it should nothing be done. After about a week permission was granted from the Icelandic government to attempt a rescue of the whale. The ALWDN decided to form an international response utilising BDMLR manpower and resources backed up by a team member from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in Cape Cod near Boston in the US. The following day the team consisting of 1 member from IFAW and 3 from BDMLR laden with over 150 kg of specialist rescue equipment met up in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik in preparation for the following days rescue attempt, but due to the complexity of the entanglement, the sheer size of the search area (Faxa Bay) where the whale was last spotted and the unpredictable weather in the area the team had allowed a minimum of a week to conduct the rescue but even then the chances of even finding the free swimming animal was very remote, and given the lack of any form of funding support for the operation and the volunteer nature of its team members a prolonged rescue attempt over the designation period would not have been possible. Extract below from BDMLR website on the rescue event and its outcome.  BDMLR rescues whale in Iceland  A specialist team from British Divers Marine Life Rescue and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have recently been to Iceland where they freed a humpback whale from fishing gear within two days of arrival. The entangled whale was first spotted in Faxa Bay, near Reykjavik on July 30th and attempts by local organisations to free the whale had been unsuccessful. The charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation put IceWhale, the Icelandic whalewatching organisation, in touch with BDMLR in the first week of August. Directors from BDMLR had initially received whale disentanglement training from the Centre for Coastal Studies (CCS) at Provincetown in the US, prior to setting up a Large Whale Disentanglement Team in the UK, so they were included in discussions and advice sought from them. CSS asked if BDMLR could assist by initially sending some equipment to Iceland, but bearing in mind the dangers associated with untrained people trying such rescues, BDMLR offered to send a small team to conduct the operation. As it was unusual for a foreign animal rescue team to be in Iceland, the government there was asked for permission and this was granted after several days of internal discussion about which department had jurisdiction. Three of BDMLR's trustees and directors, Ali Jack, Mark Stevens and Geoff Hammock, flew to Reykjavik on Friday 14th August and were joined there by Brian Sharp from IFAW in the US. With over 40 whale disentanglement rescues under his belt, his knowledge and skills would be invaluable. The following day, the team went out into the bay on one of the Elding Whale Watching boats, supported by an array of other local boats and a Coast Guard patrol vessel. The flotilla set course for the last known position of the whale from the previous day. Several hours were spent searching for the whale until the call came from another of Elding's boats that they had the whale in their sight. The whale, whilst hampered by the fishing gear wrapped around its tail stock, body and through its mouth, was busy feeding and the rescue team then spent four hours playing cat and mouse (rather big mouse!) with it, working from a small Zodiac inflatable while they attempted to grapple the trailing line coming from the whale's tail. With the assistance of the support team on board the MV Elding the team were able to predict where the whale would surface for a breath and after several close intercepts struck it lucky and managed to get into a position, allowing them to throw a grapple that caught the line and then deploy their own lines, kegging buoys. The buoys help to slow the whale down, keep it surfacing and hopefully tire it. For the next 5 hours the whale didn't help as the team tried time and time again to pull the inflatable up the line toward the whale's tail to start the process of cutting lines on the animal using their specialist equipment. This operation involves 'Nantucket sleigh rides' where the inflatable is pulled along at several knots with its outboard engine up and out of the water, with the inflatable only being attached to the whale by the team member in the bow holding the rope. The rope cannot be tied to the inflatable as if the whale dived it would take the inflatable under along with the team into a potential nest of sub surface entanglement that would immediately drown anyone who entered the water. On several occasions \\"Nettie\\" would try to shake the team off by diving deep pulling the bow of the inflatable underwater, however the quick reactions of the team averted disaster time and time again by letting the rope go just in time. This is without doubt the most dangerous type of rescue the charity engages in and it is not one for the faint-hearted. Over the course of the Nantuckets the team would pull the inflatable up to within a metre of the thrashing tail of this frightened and confused gigantic animal travelling at speed and would start to cut the line as the tail would breach the water. Several crucial cuts to the entangled line were made, however with darkness falling and utter exhaustion overcoming the team, the kegging buoys were cut off and a satellite telemetry buoy was fitted to the control line so that Nettie could be tracked over night and of course found again the following day. At 5am sharp on Sunday 16th August, the team set off once again to locate Nettie and quickly found the animal some 18km away from where it was tagged the following night. Now the operation had to start over again, trying to exhaust the animal and bring it to the surface and ideally to a dead stop. Nettie was as determined and as feisty as the previous day and again several hours of Nantucket Sleigh rides continued, but whilst it was evident that Nettie was tiring, it was obvious that the already exhausted team could not sustain a prolonged operation of this magnitude and that the team would tire before the whale did. A regroup was called so that a new strategy could be formulated. The team came up with a new method of attaching a large 4 foot buoy just behind the tail which it was hoped would stop the animal from diving and bring it to the surface for longer periods giving the team more opportunities to cut the line as the whale presented its tail. A new rig was quickly assembled on board the MV Elding using existing elements of the team's disentanglement equipment and off they went for several more Nantucket sleighrides. The new rig was proving very difficult and quite dangerous to get a decent attachment with Nettie trying to pull the inflatable under on several attempts, but eventually the team managed to attach the rig to within a metre of the whale's tail and the buoy was quickly pulled into position using the ingenious pulley arrangement they had constructed. The new rig had the desired effect and prevented the whale from diving and also had the unplanned benefit of providing a new separate control line which the team could utilise. The original control and trailing line with 3 kegging buoys attached and covered in potential snagging points and mono filament net which had been causing the team no end of grief through out the operation was discarded and left to trail harmlessly beside the inflatable. The team were now able to pull themselves up to within a metre of the thrashing tail, and each time the whale's tail would breach the surface, careful cuts would be made using the equipment. Eventually the team managed to cut the lines on both sides of the tail stock and the trailing line from underneath and Nettie swam free from the almost certain fatal entanglement. Pieces of rope remain on the animal as the entanglement was so severe with rope embedded deep into its tail stock, but it is expected that this rope will be expelled from the wounds during the healing process as has been documented on several previous post entanglement events on whales. An additional bridle remains from Nettie's head that runs through its mouth, but with both ends cut it is also expected that this will be expelled over time, possibly during feeding. The team returned to shore exhausted and aching but exhilarated at the success of their endeavour. There has been so much support and concern for this whale in Iceland and the operation was supported by so many people it is impossible to thank every individual. Special thanks however have to go to Elding Whale Watching and Ice Whale for their concern and assistance. Whale watching boats in the area will be keeping an eye out for Nettie and recording sightings in the hope that the whale sheds the remaining loose lines and recovers fully from its ordeal. BDMLR extends its gratitude and thanks for all the support many others have provided.

Known as \\"the town bully\\", McElroy's unsolved killing became the focus of international attention. Over the course of his life, McElroy was accused of dozens of felonies, including assault, child molestation, statutory rape, arson, hog and cattle rustling, and burglary. In all, he was indicted 21 times but escaped conviction each time, except for the last.Harry N. MacLean, In Broad Daylight. NY: Harper & Row, 1988. In 1981, McElroy was convicted of shooting and seriously injuring the town's 70-year- old grocer, Ernest \\"Bo\\" Bowenkamp, the previous year. McElroy successfully appealed the conviction and was released on bond, after which he engaged in an ongoing harassment campaign against Bowenkamp and others who were sympathetic to Bowenkamp, including the town's Church of Christ minister. He appeared in a local bar, the D&G; Tavern, armed with an M1 Garand rifle and bayonet, and later threatened to kill Bowenkamp. The next day, McElroy was shot to death in broad daylight as he sat with his wife Trena in his pickup truck on Skidmore's main street. He was struck by bullets from at least two different firearms, in front of a crowd of people estimated as between 30 and 46. To date, no one has been charged in connection with McElroy's death. Early life McElroy was born in 1934, the fifteenth of sixteen children born to a poor, migrant tenant-farming couple named Tony and Mabel (n√©e Lister) McElroy, who had moved between Kansas and the Ozarks before settling outside of Skidmore. He dropped out of school at age 15 in the eighth grade and quickly established a local reputation as a raccoon hunter, cattle rustler, small-time thief and womanizer. For more than two decades, McElroy was suspected of being involved in theft of grain, gasoline, alcohol, antiques and livestock, but he avoided conviction when charges were brought against him 21 times--often after witnesses refused to testify because he allegedly intimidated them, frequently by following his targets or parking outside their homes and watching them. He was represented by defense attorney Richard Gene McFadin of Gallatin, Missouri. McElroy fathered more than 10 children with different women. He met his last wife, Trena McCloud (1957‚Äì2012), when she was 12 years old and in eighth grade. He raped McCloud repeatedly, also burning her house down and shooting the family dog before her parents relented and agreed to their marriage. She became pregnant when she was fourteen, dropped out of school in the ninth grade, and went to live with McElroy and his third wife Alice. McElroy divorced Alice and married Trena in order to escape charges of statutory rape, to which she was the only witness. Sixteen days after Trena gave birth, both she and Alice fled to Trena's mother's and stepfather's house. According to court records, McElroy tracked them down and brought them back. He then returned to Trena's parents' home when they were away and, once again, shot the family dog and burned the house down. Events prior to his killing Based on Trena's story, McElroy was indicted in June 1973 for arson, assault and statutory rape. He was arrested, booked, arraigned and released on $2,500 bail. Trena and her baby were placed in foster care at a home in Maryville, Missouri. McElroy sat outside the foster home for hours at a time staring at it. He told the foster family that he would trade \\"girl for girl\\" to get his child back, since he knew where the foster family's biological daughter went to school and what bus route she rode. Additional charges were filed against McElroy. On July 27, 1976, Skidmore farmer Romaine Henry said McElroy shot him twice with a shotgun after Henry challenged him for shooting weapons on Henry's property. McElroy was charged with assault with intent to kill. McElroy denied he was at the scene. As the case dragged on without a court date, Henry said McElroy had parked outside his home at least 100 times. At the trial, two raccoon hunters testified they were with McElroy the day of the shooting away from Henry's property. Henry was forced to admit in court, under questioning by McElroy's attorney Richard Gene McFadin, that he had concealed his own petty criminal conviction from more than 30 years previous. McElroy was acquitted. 1981 killing In 1980, one of McElroy's children got into an argument with a clerk, Evelyn Sumy, in a local grocery store owned by 70-year-old Ernest \\"Bo\\" Bowenkamp and his wife Lois, allegedly because the young McElroy child tried to steal some candy. McElroy began stalking the Bowenkamp family, and eventually threatened Bo Bowenkamp in the back of his store with a shotgun in hand. In the ensuing confrontation, McElroy shot Bowenkamp in the neck; Bowenkamp survived, and McElroy was arrested and charged with attempted murder.The Death Of Ken McElroy *Interesting History* - YouTube McElroy was convicted at trial of assault, but freed on bail pending his appeal. Immediately after being released at a post-trial hearing, McElroy went to the D&G; Tavern, a local bar, with an M1 Garand rifle with a bayonet attached, and made graphic threats about what he would do to Bo Bowenkamp. This led to several patrons deciding to see what they could legally do to prevent McElroy from harming anyone else. Nodaway County Sheriff Dan Estes suggested they form a neighborhood watch. McElroy's appeal hearing was again delayed. On the morning of July 10, 1981, townspeople met at the Legion Hall in the center of town with Sheriff Estes to discuss how to protect themselves. During the meeting, McElroy arrived at the D&G; Tavern with Trena. As he sat drinking at the bar, word got back to the men at the Legion Hall that he was in town. Sheriff Estes instructed the assembled group not to get into a direct confrontation with McElroy, but instead seriously consider forming a neighborhood watch program. Estes then drove out of town in his police cruiser. The citizens decided to go to the tavern en masse. The bar soon filled completely. After McElroy finished his drinks, he purchased a six pack of beer, left the bar, and entered his pickup truck. Someone shot at McElroy while he was sitting in his truck. He was shot at several times and hit twice, once by a centerfire rifle and once by a .22 rimfire rifle. In all, there were 46 potential witnesses to the shooting, including Trena McElroy, who was in the truck with her husband when he was shot. No one called for an ambulance. Only Trena claimed to identify a gunman; every other witness either was unable to name an assailant or claimed not to have seen who fired the fatal shots. The DA declined to press charges. An extensive Federal investigation did not lead to any charges. McElroy was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in St. Joseph, Missouri. On July 9, 1984, Trena McElroy filed a $5 million wrongful death lawsuit against the Town of Skidmore, County of Nodaway, Sheriff Danny Estes, Steve Peters (Mayor of Skidmore), and Del Clement (whom Trena accused of being the shooter, but who was never charged). The case was later settled out of court by all parties for the sum of $17,600, with no one admitting guilt, for the stated reason of avoiding costly legal fees should the suit proceed. Trena remarried and moved to Lebanon, Missouri, where she died of cancer on her 55th birthday on January 24, 2012.

As Scots, they were Gaels and shared a common background and language with the Irish, but as they were descendants of 10th century Norse settlers who had intermarried with the local population in western Scotland, the Irish called them Gall Gaeil (\\"foreign Gaels\\"). Large numbers of gallowglass septs settled in Ireland after being dispossessed of their lands in Scotland for choosing to fight on the side for independence from England in the Wars of Scottish Independence. An early family of gallowglasses were the MacSweeneys, settled by the O'Donnells in north Donegal. These were followed by MacDonnells, MacCabes and several other groups settled by powerful Irish nobles in different areas. The gallowglasses were attractive as a heavily armoured, trained aristocratic infantry to be relied upon as a strong defence for holding a position, unlike most Irish foot soldiers, who were lower class and less well armoured than the typical Irish noble who fought as cavalry. In time there came to be many native Irish gallowglasses as the term came to mean a type of warrior rather than an ethnic designation. They were a significant part of Irish infantry before the advent of gunpowder, and depended upon seasonal service with Irish chieftains. A military leader would often choose a gallowglass to serve as his personal aide and bodyguard because, as a foreigner, the gallowglass would be less subject to local feuds and influences. Name Hebridean warrior The term is an anglicisation of the Irish gall√≥glaigh (lit. \\"foreign young warriors\\"), with the English plural -s added to the end. The singular of gall√≥glaigh is gall√≥glach. The word √≥glach comes from Old Irish oac (meaning \\"youth\\") and Old Irish l√≥eg (meaning \\"calf\\" but later becoming a word for a hero). Although the English term comes from an Irish plural, Encarta specifies the plural of gallowglass to be \\"gallowglasses\\". Shakespeare uses the form \\"gallowglasses\\" in the play Macbeth. The Oxford English Dictionary prefers the spelling \\"galloglass\\" and provides several examples attesting to ordinary English plural forms of the word, dating back to a c. 1515 use of \\"galloglasseis\\". \\"The etymologically correct form galloglagh appears later than the erroneous galloglass, which was probably the result of the plural gallogla(gh)s; in some early instances galloglas seems to be used as a plural, but galloglasses is found already in our earliest quot.\\" Origin The gallowglass were from the western coast of Scotland, principally Argyll and the Western Isles.Cannan, Fergus. Gallowglass 1250‚Äì1600, Osprey Publishing, 2010, . Their weapon of choice was a battle axe, but claymores were not uncommon. Each was usually accompanied by a man to see to his weapons and armour and a boy to carry provisions. Description A description from 1600 speaks of the gallowglass as \\"pycked and scelected men of great and mightie bodies, crewell without compassion. The greatest force of the battell consisteth in them, chosing rather to dye than to yeelde, so that when yt cometh to handy blowes they are quickly slayne or win the fielde.\\"Tracts relating to Ireland, Irish Archeological Society, vol. ii., Dublin, 1843 History Gallowglass gravestone fron Cloncha Church, Ireland, circa 15-16th century. Note the hurling stick and ball. The first record of gallowglass service was in 1259, when Aedh √ì Conchobair, King of Connacht, received a dowry of 160 Scottish warriors from the daughter of Dubhghall mac Ruaidhri, the King of the Hebrides. They were organised into groups known as a \\"Corrughadh\\", which consisted of about 100 men. The importation of gallowglasses into Ireland was a major factor in containing the Anglo-Norman invasion of the 12th century, as their ranks stiffened the resistance of the Irish lordships. Throughout the Middle Ages in Ireland, gallowglass troops were maintained by Gaelic Irish and Hiberno-Norman lords alike. Even the English Lord Deputy of Ireland usually kept a company of them in his service. (See also: Norman Ireland.) In return for military service, gallowglass contingents were given land and settled in Irish lordships, where they were entitled to receive supplies from the local population. By 1512, there were reported to be fifty-nine groups throughout the country under the control of the Irish nobility. Though initially they were mercenaries, over time they settled and their ranks became filled with both Scots-Norse and many native Irish men. In 1569, Turlough Luineach O'Neill (The O'Neill) married Lady Agnes Campbell, daughter of Colin Campbell, 3rd Earl of Argyll, and widow of James MacDonald, 6th of Dunnyveg. Her dowry consisted of at least 1,200 gallowglass fighters. Along with two young men as support and friends on top to assist or fight this could easily have numbered over 5,000 current and future gallowglasses coming into the area. They were noted for wielding the massive two-handed sparth axe (a custom noted by Geraldus Cambrensis, died c. 1223, to have derived from their Norse heritage) and broadsword or claymore (\\"claidheamh m√≥r\\"). For armour, the gallowglass wore a mail shirt over a padded jacket and an iron helmet; he was usually accompanied by two boys (like a knight's squires), one of whom carried his throwing spears while the other carried his provisions. Shakespeare mentions gallowglasses in his play Macbeth, although along with other aspects of the play it is an anachronism, as the historical Macbeth lived in the 11th century: > The merciless Macdonwald, Worthy to be a rebel, for to that The multiplying > villainies of nature Do swarm upon him, from the Western isles Of kerns and > gallowglasses is supplied In a paper entitled \\"A Description of the Power of Irishmen\\", written early in the 16th century, the Irish forces of Leinster are numbered at 522 horse, five battalions of gallowglass (gall√≥glaigh) and 1,432 kerne, and those of the other provinces were in like proportion. Mac C√°rthaigh M√≥r commanded 40 horse, two battalions of gallowglass, and 2,000 kerne; the Earl of Desmond 400 horse, three battalions of gallowglass, and 3,000 kerne, besides a battalion of crossbowmen and gunners, the smaller chieftains supplying each their quota of men. kern. Drawing by Albrecht D√ºrer, 1521. This is now thought to have been derived from a 1518 written account by Laurent Vital, rather than a drawing from life. In 1517, \\"when the reformacion of the countrye was taken in hand\\", it was reported that the Irish forces in Thomond were 750 horse, 2,324 kerne, and six \\"batayles\\" of gallowglass, the latter including 60 to 80 footmen harnessed with spears; each of these had a man to bear his harness, some of whom themselves carried spears or bows. Every kerne had a bow, a \\"skieve\\" or quiver, three spears, a sword, and a skeneSgian-dubh (Irish scian or Scottish Gaelic sgian), each two of them having a lad to carry their weapons. The horsemen had two horses apiece, some three, the second bearing the \\"knave\\" or his attendant. The 16th century in Ireland saw an escalation in military conflict, caused by the Tudor conquest of Ireland. Gallowglass fighters were joined by native Irish mercenaries called buanadha (literally \\"quartered men\\") and by newer Scottish mercenaries known as \\"redshanks\\". The flow of mercenaries into Ireland was such a threat to English occupation that Queen Elizabeth I took steps against them in 1571‚Äîaround 700 of them were executed after the first of the Desmond Rebellions. Despite the increased use of firearms in Irish warfare, gallowglasses remained an important part of Hugh √ì Neill's forces in the Nine Years' War. After the combined Irish defeat at the Battle of Kinsale in 1601, recruitment of gallowglasses waned, although Scottish Highland mercenaries continued to come to Ireland until the 1640s (notably Alasdair Mac Colla). They fought under the Irish general Eoin Roe O'Neill at the Battle of Benburb when O'Neill had an overwhelming victory in 1646. The gallowglasses of the Mac C√°rthaigh Riabhaigh are recorded as having attacked Mallow in County Cork as late as 1645. Images of gallowglasses fighting as mercenaries in European mainland armies were sketched by D√ºrer in 1521 and later by French and Dutch artists. Gallowglasses served in the Dutch Blue Guards, Swiss Guard, the French Scottish Guard, and the forces of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in his invasion of Livonia during the Thirty Years' War. Milford or Millford, historically called Ballynagalloglagh (from Irish: Baile na nGall√≥glach), is a small town and townland in County Donegal, Ireland. The Irish Baile na nGall√≥glach literally means \\"town of the gall√≥glach\\". A battle between the Irish (helped by gall√≥glaigh) and the English took place on a hill in the townland and this is where the name comes from.

In its simplest form, a single \\"write\\" laser beam is shot once through the sample space. Along its path an optically induced chemical process is initiated, resulting in the creation of a new chemical species or in changing the internal energy state of an existing one, so that the molecules struck by the laser beam can be distinguished from the rest of the fluid. Such molecules are said to be \\"tagged\\". This line of tagged molecules is now transported by the fluid flow. To obtain velocity information, images at two instances in time are obtained and analyzed (often by correlation of the image intensities) to determine the displacement. If the flow is three-dimensional or turbulent the line will not only be displaced, it will also be deformed. Description There are three optical ways via which these tagged molecules can be visualized: fluorescence, phosphorescence and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). In all three cases molecules relax to a lower state and their excess energy is released as photons. In fluorescence this energy decay occurs rapidly (within 10^{-7} s to 10^{-9} s at atmospheric pressure), thus making \\"direct\\" fluorescence impractical for tagging. In phosphorescence the decay is slower, because the transition is quantum-mechanically forbidden. In some \\"writing\\" schemes, the tagged molecule ends up in an excited state. If the molecule relaxes through phosphorescence, lasting long enough to see line displacement, this can be used to track the written line and no additional visualisation step is needed. If during tagging the molecule did not reach a phosphorescing state, or relaxed before the molecule was \\"read\\", a second step is needed. The tagged molecule is then excited using a second laser beam, employing a wavelength such that it specifically excites the tagged molecule. The molecule will fluoresce and this fluorescence is captured by means of a camera. This manner of visualisation is called laser induced fluorescence (LIF). Optical techniques are frequently used in modern fluid velocimetry but most are opto-mechanical in nature. Opto-mechanical techniques do not rely on photonics alone for flow measurements but require macro-size seeding. The best known and often used examples are particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). Within the field of all-optical techniques we can distinguish analogous techniques but using molecular tracers. In Doppler schemes, light quasi-elastically scatters off molecules and the velocity of the molecules convey a Doppler shift to the frequency of the scattered light. In molecular tagging techniques, like in PIV, velocimetry is based on visualizing the tracer displacements. Schemes MTV techniques have proven to allow measurements of velocities in inhospitable environments, like jet engines, flames, high pressure vessels, where it is difficult for techniques like Pitot, hot-wire velocimetry and PIV to work. The field of MTV is fairly young; the first demonstration of implementation emerged within the 1980s and the number of schemes developed and investigated for use in air is still fairly small. These schemes differ in the molecule that is created, whether seeding the flow with foreign molecules is necessary and what wavelength of light are being used. The most thorough fluid mechanics studies have been performed using the RELIEF scheme and the APART scheme. Both techniques can be used in ambient air without the need of additional seeding. In RELIEF, excited oxygen is used as tracer. The method takes advantage of quantum mechanical properties that prohibit relaxation of the molecule, so that the excited oxygen has a relatively long lifetime. APART is based on the \\"photosynthesis\\" of nitric oxide. Since NO is a stable molecule, patterns written with it can, in principle, be followed almost indefinitely. Another well-developed and widely documented technique that yields extremely high accuracy is hydroxyl tagging velocimetry (HTV). It is based on photo-dissociation of water vapor followed by visualisation of the resulting OH radical using LIF. HTV has been successfully demonstrated in many test conditions ranging from room air temperature flows to Mach 2 flows within a cavity.

Biography Liberi was born in Padua, his earliest training was with Alessandro Varotari (il Padovanino). He had an adventure-filled life. He traveled extensively in Italy. During a voyage to Istanbul, he was captured into bondage for 8 months by pirates from Tunis. Released through Malta, he visited Sicily, Naples, and Pisa. For a few years in his life, he became a mercenary with the forces of cavaliere Antonio Manfredini, who was fighting for the Duchy of Tuscany against the Saracens. He fought to capture the Castle of Sichia, in present ƒ∞skenderun in Turkey. After the campaign, he returned to Livorno, and in 1637, traveled to Lisbon, visited Liguria, the Southern coast of France and Madrid. Back in Tuscany, he focused again on painting, travelling to Rome. There he was a roommate of the engraver Stefano della Bella. In Rome, he painted a Rape of the Sabines for Leopoldo de' Medici. He returned to Florence to paint a ceiling in the Oratory of San Filippo Neri. He traveled to Venice in 1643, painting Evangelists for the church of the Ospedaletto. He also painted a large altarpiece (1650) for the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice. He painted a St Anthony of Padua with Venice in prayer for the church of the Salute. In 1662, he was knighted by the Doge Francesco Molino.[ Della origine e delle vicende della pittura in Padova], by Giannantonio Moschini, Tipografia Crescini, Padua (1826), page 114‚Äì116. He was nicknamed il Libertino due to his frequent choice of salacious themes in cabinet pieces.

Wheeler Robinson. As originally formulated, it dealt with areas of the Old Testament where the relationships between individuals and the groups that they were part of were treated. For example, Achan's family was (at least in some interpretations of the text) collectively punished for a sin that is viewed as primarily Achan's alone. It has since fallen out of favour with theologians, who now favour other interpretations of the Old Testament. However, some theologians still use the idea, construed in a more narrow sense, to explain the use of \\"\\" for \\"in Christ\\" (amongst others) in the New Testament writings of Paul the Apostle. The notion of Old Testament corporate personality encompasses four things: :;identification:Individuals are never considered to be isolated from the groups that they belong to, and are often treated as representatives for, or even as wholly identified with, those groups. :;extension:The boundaries of the individual are extended to additionally encompass other people that belong to that individual. This extension can be both in space, from a king to a kingdom, and in time, from a parent to his descendants. Examples of extension include Achan (mentioned earlier), Korah (Izhar's son), and David, where a leader is punished or rewarded by punishing or rewarding those whom he leads. :;realism:The relationship between the group and the individual is a real one. :;oscillation:There exists an oscillation back and forth between the group and the individual. In Pauline theology, the notion of corporate personality is largely restricted to its representational aspect. Paul's comparison between Jesus Christ and Adam is viewed, by those theologians that adhere to the notion, as an identification of Christ as the king and those people in the kingdom that he leads. Similarly, in his Epistle to the Galatians, Paul speaks of Gentiles being blessed both \\"in\\" Abraham and also \\"with\\" him--which these theologians hold to be another example of corporate personality in Paul's writings.

The Chilean Navy cruiser Chacabuco was the sister ship to Takasago; the Japanese cruiser was sometimes also regarded as a sister ship to Takasago, due to the similarity in their design, armament and speed, although the two vessels were of different classes. Takasago was laid down in April 1896, as Elswick hull number 660, as a private venture by Armstrong Whitworth, and was sold the Japan in July 1896. Launch occurred on 18 May 1897 and she was completed on 6 April 1898.Brooke, Warships for Export Design Takasago was a typical Elswick cruiser design, with a steel hull, divided into 109 waterproof compartments, a low forecastle, two smokestacks, and two masts. She made use of Harvey armor, which was intended to be able to protect against the impact of even an 8-inch armor-piercing shell. The prow was reinforced for ramming. The power plant was a triple expansion reciprocating steam engine with four cylindrical boilers, driving two screws.Chesneau, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860‚Äì1905, page 229. In this aspect, the design was almost identical to that of Yoshino, however in terms of armament, Takasago was more heavily armed. The main armament of Takasago were two separate 20.3 cm/45 Type 41 naval guns behind gun shields, which were placed on bow and stern. Secondary armament consisted of ten Elswick QF 6 inch /40 naval gun quick-firing guns mounted in casemates and in sponsons near the bridge. Takasago was also equipped with twelve QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval guns, six QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and five torpedo tubes. Service record The first overseas deployment of Takasago was in 1900, to support Japanese naval landing forces which occupied the port city of Tianjin in northern China during the Boxer Rebellion, as part of the Japanese contribution to the Eight-Nation Alliance. On 7 April 1902, Takasago and were sent on a voyage to the United Kingdom, as part of the official Japanese delegation to the coronation ceremonies of King Edward VII,http://www.walesonline.co.uk/videos-and- pics/photos/news-pictures/2008/11/27/tramcars-of-wales-91466-22353688/i14/ and in celebration of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. After participating in a naval review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 (originally scheduled from 24‚Äì27 June), Takasago and Asama visited numerous European and Asian ports (Singapore, Colombo, Suez, Malta, Lisbon on the way, Antwerp and Cork during their stay, and Gibraltar, Naples, Aden, Colombo, Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong on the way back). The ships returned safely to Japan on 28 November 1902. Russo-Japanese War With the start of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, Takasago participated in the bombardment of the Port Arthur naval base on the morning following the pre-emptive strike by Japanese destroyers against the Russian fleet in the opening stages of the naval Battle of Port Arthur, serving as flagship for Admiral Dewa Shigeto. The Japanese attack set fire to a portion of the town, and damaged a number of ships in the harbor, especially the cruisers , and , and the battleship .Connaughton, Rising Sun and Tumbling Bear page 33 While participating in the subsequent blockade of the Russian fleet within the confines of the harbor, Takasago captured the Russian Far East Shipping Company merchant ship Manchuria, which was accepted into Japanese service as a prize of war and renamed Kant≈ç Maru. On 10 March 1904, Takasago participated in an attack on the Russian cruiser . On 15 May, she participated in the rescue of survivors from the battleships and , which had struck naval mines. Takasago was also in the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August. She returned to Japan for overhaul in October 1904. On returning to station on the night of 13 December 1904 after a reconnaissance mission during which it provided cover for a squadron of destroyers,Willmont, The Last Century of Sea Power page 98 Takasago struck a naval mine south of Port Arthur, which triggered a massive explosion in her ammunition magazine. The flooding could not be controlled, and her life boats could not be launched at night under blizzard conditions and heavy seas. Takasago sank in position , with the loss of 273 officers and crew. Some 162 survivors were rescued by the accompanying cruiser . Takasago was the last major Japanese warship lost in the Russo-Japanese War. Future Russian Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, then a minesweeper captain at Port Arthur with the Russian Pacific Squadron, was credited with having placed the mine, and was awarded the prestigious Order of St Anna and Sword of St George for the action.Kusnezov, Reeds in the Wind page 43 Gallery File:Japanese cruiser Takasago at Portsmouth.jpgAt Portsmouth File:Japanese cruiser Takasago by Albert Reuben Martin.jpgAt Portsmouth File:IJN Takasago in Taiwan.jpgIn Taiwan File:Japanese cruiser Takasago in 1896.jpgIn 1896 NotesReferences    * External links Category:Cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy Category:Ships built by Armstrong Whitworth Category:Ships built on the River Tyne Category:1897 ships Category:Naval ships of Japan Category:Russo-Japanese War cruisers of Japan Category:Ships sunk by mines Category:Shipwrecks in the Yellow Sea Category:Maritime incidents in 1904 Category:Shipwrecks of the Russo-Japanese War ","title":"Japanese cruiser Takasago"},{"id":"3798906","text":"right right City Bank Stadium is the home stadium of the Forney Jackrabbits and the North Forney Falcons and is located on the campus of Forney High School.

Benshi are sometimes called or .All these forms are abbreviations of , where means \\"moving pictures\\", i.e., an old term for films, and is an orator or public speaker; see Role During silent films, the benshi stood to the side of the screen and introduced and related the story to the audience. In theatrical style, benshi often spoke for the characters on-screen and played multiple roles. Stemming from the traditions of kabuki and Noh theaters, the benshi's narration and general commentary were an important part of the Japanese silent film experience. The benshi also provided translation for foreign (mostly American) movies.Standish, Isolde. A New History of Japanese Cinema: A Century of Narrative Film. New York: Continuum, 2005. Much like in the West, Japanese silent films were often accompanied by live music (in addition to the benshi). However, unlike Western films, which tended to have a theatre organ as accompaniment, Japanese films had a score which supported the traditional Japanese instruments of a kabuki play. Since benshi performed without external amplification, they had to carefully coordinate with the orchestra to be heard. At that time, theaters typically seated 1000, so a trademark of successful benshi was the ability to project their voices into large spaces.Dym, Jeffery (2008). A Brief History of Benshi (Silent Film Narrators). Famous benshi active in the silent era include Musei Tokugawa (at the Aoikan and Musashinokan theaters), Sabur≈ç Somei (at the Denkikan), Rakuten Nishimura, Raiy≈´ Ikoma (at the Teikokukan), Mitsugu ≈åkura, and Shir≈ç ≈åtsuji. In the 1995 film Picture Bride, Toshir≈ç Mifune portrays a benshi who traveled to sugar cane plantations in Hawaii during the early 20th century.  Influence on film aesthetic  As the film industry and art form developed in Japan, the presence of a benshi came to be part of the film. Benshi read the intertitles on silent films and voiced all on-screen characters. Perhaps most significantly for filmmakers, benshi would add their own commentary, explaining what was happening in a shot or describing what had happened in confusing edits or sudden transitions. Some benshi were known to interpret and add to a script, for example reciting poetry to accompany a moving visual. In addition, it was traditional for the benshi to introduce the film, even giving a brief lecture about the history of the setting. This meant that filmmakers could assume that a live narrator, accustomed to improvisation, would be present at the showing to explain scenes or even explain missing scenes or unfilmed action. Perhaps because most early Japanese films were simply kabuki plays adapted to film, the characterization style benshi performed roles strongly influenced by the narrators in kabuki or a noh chorus‚Äîa grave, dramatic, exaggerated style. Due to the influence of kabuki, audiences were not distracted by a single benshi voicing male and female roles, regardless of the gender of the benshi.  Influence on film industry  In 1927, there were 6,818 benshi, including 180 women.Cook, David A. (1990). A History of Narrative Film, New York: W. W. Norton & Company. . Many benshi were famous in their own right and garnered great acclaim. The presence of a benshi was the aspect of the film presentation that drew in the audience, more so than the actors appearing in the film, and promotional posters would frequently include a photo of the benshi announcing the movie. The silent film era lasted until the mid-1930s in Japan in part due to benshi, despite the introduction of sound in full-length films in the late 1920s. The adoption of this new technology was slowed by the popularity and influence of the benshi (in addition to the high costs to the cinemas and production companies). Though the tradition has mostly faded, there are a few remaining active benshi in Japan (e.g., Midori Sawato).  Benshi in other cultures  * The benshi tradition was adopted in Taiwan under the name piansu (). * Benshi were present in Korea from the first decade of the twentieth century where they were called \\"byeonsa\\" (Î≥ÄÏÇ¨).Maliangkay, Roald H. \\"Classifying Performances: The Art of Korean Film Narrators\\" . Image and Narrative: Online Magazine of the Visual Narrative, Issue 10 (March 2005). ISSN 1780-678X. Accessed 12 April 2009. * In the USSR, during the early years of the Brezhnev era, the availability of foreign films was severely restricted. The USSR State Committee for Cinematography held closed-door screenings of many Western films, open mainly to workers in the film industry, politicians, and other members of the elite. Those screenings were interpreted simultaneously by interpreters who specialized in films, where an effective conveyance of humour, idioms, and other subtleties of speech were required. Some of the most prolific \\"Gavrilov translators\\" began their careers at such screenings.  Modern benshi  * Midori Sawato * Yuko Sait≈ç * Ichir≈ç Kataoka * Raiko Sakamoto * Mami Sakurai * Tomoko Komura * Vanilla Yamazaki  New benshi practices  The underlying concept of benshi, live narration of film, continues to work its way into performance practices. The actual practice of \\"benshi\\" is most commonly referenced in relation to live film narration largely due to it having been and when the practice was more formalized and financed. As evidenced by the (above) listings of \\"benshi\\" in other cultures, the art of cinema accompanied by a live performer was as international then as it is now. There are groups in the United States seeking to revive this form and to continue exploring the possibilities of altering the form in the spirit of experimentation from which the practice emerged. Likewise, new attempts to subvert traditional notions of storytelling and film watching are underway. Some performers interject commentary into films, drawing from a century of social critique, often presenting popular films along with new dialog and narrative intended to juxtapose their ideas with those of the audience. While some have adopted the term \\"Neo-Benshi\\", other performers have chosen to adopt the title \\"movieteller\\" as an alternative. They believe it emphasizes the multicultural past and future(s) of the form, while inviting further experimentation with the medium, such as a live narration of one's own films, the implementation of instruments as narrative devices, or any instance where a human contingent mediates between an audience and an image.

He was a leading voice of the Cient√≠ficos, \\"the scientists\\" who were the intellectual leaders during the regime of Porfirio D√≠az. Life and career Sierra married Luz Mayora in 1874. He was the son of Mexican novelist Justo Sierra O'Reilly, who is credited with inspiring his son with the spirit of literature. Sierra moved to Mexico City at the age of 13 in 1861, the year of his father's death, and also, coincidentally, the year of the French intervention in Mexico. Together with his fellow young students, Sierra responded with patriotic fervor to the invasion of his country, and became a lifelong militant liberal. His most enduring works are sociopolitical histories (at times verging on memoirs) of the era of Benito Ju√°rez and Porfirio D√≠az, particularly his political biography of Ju√°rez and his Evoluci√≥n pol√≠tica del pueblo mexicano. Antonio Caso is considered the definitive statement of the age of the Reform in Mexico. Sierra was elected a member of the Mexican Academy of Language in 1887, and served as the Academy's sixth director from 1910 until his death in 1912. Public service Elected to several terms as a representative in the federal Chamber of Deputies, Sierra also served the government in various posts. From 1905 to 1911, he agreed to serve as the Secretary of Public Education under the D√≠az regime. However, he never made a secret of his liberal sympathies and his distaste for the politics of the authoritarian regime. After the overthrow of D√≠az in May 1911 and the election of Francisco I. Madero at the outset of the Mexican Revolution, Madero chose Sierra to serve as the Mexican ambassador to Spain. Sierra died from an aneurysm in Madrid in 1912 while serving in his post. His remains were returned to Mexico, where president Madero presided over his magnificent funeral. Historian Justo Sierra made significant contributions to the writing of Mexican history. His texts on pre- revolutionary Mexico continued to be used in Mexican public schools even after the Mexican Revolution.

First flown in 1999, it has been launched 36 times, with three failures and one partial failure. It is a member of the Zenit family of rockets, and is built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau. RKK Energia produces the Block DM-SL upper stage, whilst the payload fairing is produced by Boeing. Launches are conducted from the Ocean Odyssey platform anchored on the equator in the Pacific Ocean, at a point with 154¬∞W longitude, about 370 kilometres east of Kiritimati. The Zenit-3SL design began in the late 1980s as the Zenit-3, a proposed replacement for the Proton-K, which would have used a Zenit-2 rocket with a Block D upper stage. This proposal was shelved after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as Russia inherited the space programme, however the Zenit was manufactured in Ukraine. Boeing became involved in the programme in 1994. The design was subsequently modified, with a modified version of the Block DM replacing the Block D. Sea Launch integrates the rockets in California, and transfers them to Odyssey via the Sea Launch Commander for transportation to the launch site. Once at the launch site, the rocket is erected on the platform, and a three-day countdown is initiated. The countdown is fully automated, and personnel are evacuated from the launch platform to Commander prior to launch. Zenit-3SL launches predominantly carry communications satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbits. As of 2009, the only payload to be launched by a Zenit-3SL that was not a communications satellite was a DemoSat, on the maiden flight. The only launch to be conducted to an orbit other than GTO was that of ICO F-1, which was intended to be placed into medium Earth orbit, however the rocket failed to reach orbit. Reliability Of thirty-six rockets launched, three have failed, with a fourth placing its payload into an incorrect, but recoverable orbit. The first failure occurred during the third flight, on 12 March 2000, when a software error resulted in the premature cutoff of the second stage, leaving the ICO F-1 satellite unable to reach orbit. On 29 June 2004, during the launch of Apstar 5, the upper stage shut down 54 seconds early due to a wiring fault, leaving the satellite in a lower than planned orbit. The spacecraft raised itself to the correct orbit by means of its onboard manoeuvring engines, at the expense of fuel intended for stationkeeping once in the correct orbit. On 30 January 2007, a Zenit-3SL exploded on the launch pad after an engine failure caused by debris in the turbopump. The payload on that flight was the NSS-8 communications satellite for SES New Skies. This caused a considerable amount of downtime whilst damage to the launch platform was repaired. On 1 February 2013, during the launch of Intelsat-27, a Zenit-3SL launch vehicle suffered a premature engine shutdown, as the rocket strayed from its lift-off trajectory, plunging into the Pacific Ocean shortly after launch.

It featured a montage of images of Americans going to work, and a calm, optimistic narration that suggested that the improvements to the U.S. economy since the 1980 election were due to Reagan's policies. It asked voters why they would want to return to the pre-Reagan policies of Democrats like his opponent Walter Mondale, who had served as the Vice President under Reagan's immediate predecessor Jimmy Carter. The phrase \\"It's morning again in America\\" is used both as a literal statement (people are shown going to work as they would in the morning), and as a metaphor for renewal. Details Full text of the ad: The ad was written and narrated by ad man Hal Riney, who also wrote and narrated Reagan's resonant \\"Bear in the woods\\" ad (titled \\"Bear\\") as well as his \\"America's Back\\" ad. To many, his rich, avuncular voice represented wholesomeness and authenticity. Bernie Vangrin of Hal Riney & Partners was the Art Director of the ad, which was directed and filmed by John Pytka of Levine/Pytka Productions. Locations  \\"Morning In America\\" was filmed in Petaluma, California. Resonance This advertisement won industry awards and praise from the political and advertising world. Republican strategist Dan Schnur said of Riney's work: \\"Most political advertising hits viewers over the head, while his work makes just as strong a point but in a less confrontational and a more soothing manner.\\" \\"Creating Reagan's image\\", SFGate Adaptations and references During Super Bowl LIII, Hulu aired a trailer for the third season of The Handmaid's Tale that was inspired by \\"Morning in America\\".

Donald Trump.  2016 presidential election  During the 2016 presidential primaries, Republican Party candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both referenced \\"morning in America\\" rhetoric in attempts to reflect the politics and spirit of Reagan. Rubio's \\"Morning Again in America\\" television ad, which features montage footage of everyday American life in both cities and suburbs, drew widespread criticism for opening with a shot of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Ted Cruz used variations of the phrase throughout his campaign, often at concluding or climactic points in his speeches.

Stanford is a 4-4-0 steam locomotive originally built in 1862 by Norris Locomotive Works. Following construction, it was disassembled and hauled by the ship Herald of the Morning around Cape Horn to California, then up the rivers aboard the schooner Artful Dodger, arriving in Sacramento on October 6, 1863. With a dedication ceremony that included artillery discharge, it entered service on November 9, 1863, and it was used in the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad in North America by Central Pacific Railroad bearing road number 1. It was Central Pacific's first locomotive and it is named in honor of the road's first president and ex-California governor, Leland Stanford. In May 1864, the Gov. Stanford was used to pull the first ceremonial passenger train beginning in Sacramento. The locomotive was rebuilt on 1878 with larger cylinders and an increased boiler pressure, which increased its tractive effort to . In 1891 the locomotive was renumbered to 1174, although both Joslyn (1956) and Diebert & Strapac (1987) both assert that this number was never actually applied to the locomotive. The locomotive was retired from regular service on July 20, 1895, then donated to Stanford University; however, it was not delivered to the university until 1899. The locomotive was disassembled and stored during World War II but was returned to display at the university after reassembly by retired Southern Pacific engineer Billy Jones. In the 1960s, the university needed the space occupied by the engine for other uses, so the engine was removed and loaned in 1963 to the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, which had been in the process of collecting historic locomotives and rolling stock to be displayed in what would ultimately become the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. The locomotive is currently a centerpiece at the museum where it has been cosmetically restored to its 1899 appearance.

As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the ship was built in Britain. She served in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05 during which she participated in the Battle of Chemulpo Bay and the Battle of the Yellow Sea without damage, although her luck did not hold out during the Battle of Tsushima. Early in World War I, Asama unsuccessfully searched for German commerce raiders until she was severely damaged when she ran aground off the Mexican coast in early 1915. Repairs took over two years to complete and she was mainly used as a training ship for the rest of her career. The ship made a total of 12 training cruises before she was crippled after running aground again in 1935. Asama then became a stationary training ship until she was broken up in 1946‚Äì1947.  Background and description  The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan was made after the First Sino-Japanese War and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships, all of which had to be ordered from British shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships. The revised plan is commonly known as the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\".Evans & Peattie, pp. 57‚Äì62 Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes, Asama and her half-sisters were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline.Milanovich, p. 72 The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars. She had a beam of and had an average draft of . Asama displaced at normal load and at deep load. The ship had a metacentric height of .Milanovich, pp. 74, 80 Her crew consisted of 676 officers and enlisted men.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 72 Asama had two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller shaft.Milanovich, p. 81 Steam for the engines was provided by a dozen cylindrical boilers and the engines were rated at a total of . The ship had a designed speed of and reached during her sea trials from . She carried up to of coal and could steam for at a speed of . The main armament for all of the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\" armored cruisers was four eight-inch guns in twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The secondary armament consisted of 14 Elswick Ordnance Company \\"Pattern Z\\" quick-firing (QF), guns. Only four of these guns were not mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields. Asama was also equipped with a dozen QF 12-pounder 12-cwt guns\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. and eight QF 2.5-pounder Yamauchi guns as close-range defense against torpedo boats. The ship was equipped with five torpedo tubes, one above water in the bow and four submerged tubes, two on each broadside.Milanovich, p. 78 All of the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\" armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences, of which the most important was that the two Asama-class ships used less tough Harvey armor. The waterline belt ran the full length of the ship and its thickness varied from amidships to at the bow and stern. It had a height of , of which was normally underwater. The upper strake of belt armor was thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck. It extended from the forward to the rear barbette. The Asama class had oblique 127 mm armored bulkheads that closed off the ends of the central armored citadel.Milanovich, pp. 80‚Äì81 The barbettes, gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 152-millimeters thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by of armor. The deck was 51-millimeters thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was in thickness.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 224 Construction and career Asama at anchor on completion The contract for Asama, named after Mount Asama,Silverstone, p. 326 was signed on 6 July 1897 with Armstrong Whitworth. The ship had already been laid down at their shipyard in Elswick on 20 October 1896 as a speculative venture. She was launched on 21 March 1898 and completed on 18 March 1899. Asama left for Japan the next day and arrived in Yokosuka on 17 May.Milanovich, p. 73 On 30 April 1900, the ship was used by Emperor Meiji during a fleet review off at Kobe. In July 1902, Asama was the flagship of Rear-Admiral G. Ijuin as part of the delegation dispatched to the United Kingdom for the Coronation Review for King Edward VII in Spithead on 16 August.Brook, p. 109 She also visited Antwerp in July, and Cork in August. During the outward leg of this voyage, the ship tested some advanced British radio technology between Malta and Britain.Inaba, pp. 66‚Äì67 Russo-Japanese War Some of the crew of Asama in 1904, prior to the Russo-Japanese War At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, Asama was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet,Kowner, p. 465 although she was attached to the 4th Division of Rear Admiral Ury≈´ Sotokichi for operations near Seoul, Korea. His ships were tasked to escort transports carrying troops to Chemulpo, Seoul's port on the west coast, and to destroy the Russian protected cruiser and gunboat stationed in Chemulpo as guardships. The troops were successfully unloaded during the night of 8/9 February and the Japanese ships left the harbor the following morning to assume positions blocking the exits as international law forbade combat between belligerents in neutral harbors. The Japanese notified the Russians that morning that a state of war existed between their countries after the IJN launched a surprise attack on Port Arthur the previous night. The two Russian ships sortied from the harbor later that morning. Varyag was the target of most of the Japanese fire and Asama hit her at least twice, destroying her bridge and punching a hole below her waterline that caused a serious list. The Russian ships managed to return to port and scuttled themselves that afternoon. Asama was not injured during the engagement and rejoined Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonoj≈ç's 2nd Division afterwards.Warner & Warner, pp. 188‚Äì95 In early March, Kamimura was tasked to take the reinforced 2nd Division north and make a diversion off Vladivostok. While scouting for Russian ships in the area, the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect. Upon their return to Japan a few days later, the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the Imperial Guards Division to Korea and then to join the ships blockading Port Arthur. Asama was then transferred to Rear Admiral Dewa Shiget≈ç's 3rd Division.Corbett, I, pp. 127, 138‚Äì39 Vice Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, commander of the Combined Fleet, successfully lured out a portion of the Russian Pacific Squadron on 13 April, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, the battleship . During this action, Asama engaged the Russian cruisers that preceded the battleships before falling back on T≈çg≈ç's battleships.Warner & Warner, pp. 236‚Äì38 When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur and his flagship ran into the minefield just laid by the Japanese. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. In addition to this loss, the battleship was damaged by a mine.Forczyk, pp. 45‚Äì46 On 23 June, the ship was presentCorbett, I, pp. 208, 223, 294‚Äì95 when the Pacific Squadron sortied in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese battleline shortly before sunset, as he did not wish to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle.Warner & Warner, pp. 305‚Äì06 =Battle of the Yellow Sea= Asama at sea, c. 1904 On the morning of 10 August 1904, Asama was coaling when the Russians sortied from Port Arthur in another attempt to reach Vladivostok. The ship was not in position to join the battle until around 19:00 when she opened fire at a range of from the damaged Russian battleship Poltava. The shell fell short and the Russian cruisers came to the support of the battleship so that by 19:25, Asama hotly engaged with the Russian ships at a range of . Despite the arrival of the elderly cruisers of Rear Admiral Yamada Hikohachi's 5th Division around 19:30, Asama was forced to disengage when the other Russian battleships came within range. The following morning she met up with T≈çg≈ç's 1st Division and then rejoined the 3rd Division. On 14 August, the 3rd Division was ordered to Tsingtao to confirm that the Germans had indeed interned the battleship and three destroyers that had taken shelter there after the battle. After their return, they were reassigned to the blockade of Port Arthur.Corbett, I, pp. 389, 397‚Äì98, 417, 425, 451‚Äì52 On 18 September, Asama and the armored cruiser were transferred to the 1st Division. When the Imperial Japanese Army began sinking the Russian ships in Port Arthur with large-caliber howitzers in early December, T≈çg≈ç ordered the two cruisers home to refit. On 30 December, Asama and the armored cruiser were ordered north to the Tsugaru Strait. Before the Russian ships from the Baltic Fleet approached Japan, the two cruisers were recalled south and rejoined the armored cruisers of Kamimura's 2nd Division.Corbett, II, pp. 47, 104, 153, 217 =Battle of Tsushima= A Japanese postcard of Asama at anchor, after 1904 As the Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons approached Japan on 27 May, having sailed from the Baltic Sea, they were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning, but visibility was limited and radio reception poor. The preliminary reports were enough to cause T≈çg≈ç to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships under the command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky at around 11:30. Kamimura closed to about a range of before sheering off under fire to join T≈çg≈ç's battleships.Corbett, II, pp. 232, 235 Asama was fifth of six when T≈çg≈ç opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14:10 and, like most of the ships in the division, engaged the battleship . The cruiser was hit by a shell at 14:28 and the shock knocked out her steering mechanism. She fell out of formation for repairs which were completed six minutes later. While she was attempting to rejoin Kamimura, she was struck by two more 12-inch shells that caused serious flooding, enough to increase her draft by and reduce her speed. Despite the damage, Asama was able to join the 1st Division at 15:15. The cruiser attempted to rejoin her own division at 15:50. But she was so slowed by her damage and a 6-inch hit at 16:10 that holed the base of her rear funnel, which reduced her boiler draught until repairs were completed 20 minutes later, that the ship could not take station aft of Iwate until 17:05.Campbell, Part 2, pp. 128‚Äì32; Part 4, p. 263 After 17:30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers, leaving T≈çg≈ç's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin T≈çg≈ç. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8000‚Äì9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined T≈çg≈ç at 20:08 as night was falling. Asamas flooding increased overnight and she was forced to stop at 06:30 for nearly an hour before continuing.Campbell, Part 3, pp. 186‚Äì87, 191 The main body of surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range. The elderly Russian armored cruiser was spotted shortly before 18:00 and Asama was ordered by T≈çg≈ç to join the pursuit in support of the protected cruisers of the 4th Division. By the time the cruiser met up with the 4th Division, night had fallen and Dmitrii Donskoi had taken refuge in shallow water. She was found the following morning by the Japanese, after most of her crew had been disembarked and the ship prepared to be scuttled. The Japanese attempt to seize her was thwarted when the ship capsized and sank.Corbett, II, pp. 319‚Äì20, 329‚Äì31 During the battle, Asama was struck by three 12-, two and about seven smaller shellsCampbell, Part 4, p. 263 that killed 11 men and wounded 13 more.Brook, p. 110 The ship reached Maizuru Naval Arsenal on 30 May to begin repairs.Corbett, II, p. 336 She carried Emperor Meiji through the fleet during the victory review in Tokyo Bay on 15 September. The ship was assigned to the Training Squadron from 1 June 1910 to 1 April 1911, during which time she made a training cruise with naval cadets to North and Central American and Hawaii from 16 October 1910 to 6 March 1911, accompanied by the protected cruiser . This was the first of her dozen training cruises that lasted until 1935 and the next lasted from 20 April to 11 August 1914.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 656‚Äì59 World War I On 14 September 1914, Asama was departed Yokosuka as part of the 1st South Seas Squadron that searched for Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee's German East Asia Squadron in the South Sea Islands. On 25 October, the ship was detached and ordered to Honolulu, Hawaii, to prevent the departure of the German gunboat , together with the ex-Russian battleship Hizen. After the gunboat was interned on 8 November, the two ships sailed to rendezvous with the other ships of the American Expeditionary Squadron at Magdalena Bay, Baja California on the 22nd. The squadron then headed south to search along the western coast of South America for German commerce raiders. On 11 December, after the receiving the news of the British victory in the Battle of the Falkland Islands, the squadron moved north to search off the western coast of Central America and then moved north to search Mexican and U.S. waters in January. Asama searched Mazatl√°n on 28 January and then proceeded to investigate the desolate and waterless bay at Puerto San Bartolom√© in Baja California where her captain, Yoshioka Hansaku, also intended to recoal from the British collier . On 31 January 1915 the ship struck an uncharted rock at the entrance to the bay and was stuck fast. The impact ripped a hole, initially estimated as long, that completely flooded the boiler rooms and put of water in the engine room. After initial attempts to get the ship off the rock failed, her crew began off-loading supplies and set kedge anchors to stabilize the cruiser and prevent further damage to her bottom. The collier arrived that evening and was sent to San Diego to send word of the incident to Japanese authorities as Asama was powerless and Lena lacked a radio. The armored cruiser , flagship of the squadron commander Rear Admiral Moriyama Keizaburo, arrived on 12 February and he requested the immediate dispatch of salvage and repair ships. The protected cruiser and the supply ship arrived on 18 March and they were followed the next day by Asamas sister, , and the repair ship Kamakura Maru. Vice Admiral Tochinai Sojiro, who arrived aboard Tokiwa, relieved Moriyama who was due to return home. Salvage efforts began in earnest with the arrival of the repair ship Kant≈ç on 24 March which brought over 250 shipwrights from the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal to assist. By 14 April over of material had been removed from the cruiser and further investigation showed that the forward boiler room had a hole by and the hole in the aft boiler room measured by . It was no wonder that, given the state of the ship's bottom, pumping overboard of water was not enough to empty the ship of water. On 8 May the ship was successfully refloated at high tide, but she required three more months of work before she could be considered minimally sea worthy. Asama tested her watertight integrity on 21 August outside the bay and she departed at a speed of for the British naval base at Esquimalt, British Columbia, two days later for temporary repairs, escorted by Chitose and Kant≈ç. During the voyage the ship still had to pump some per hour. The repairs in Esquimalt reduced this figure to a mere per hour after the cruiser sailed for Yokosuka on 23 October. She arrived on 18 December and Emperor Taish≈ç received her officers in the Imperial Palace two days later.Estes Permanent repairs, which included the replacement of her boilers by 16 Miyabara water-tube boilers and the removal of her bow torpedo tube, were not completed until March 1917,Lacroix & Wells, p. 659 Asama served as the flagship of Destroyer Squadron (Suiraisentai) 2 from 13 April to 4 August before she was transferred to the Training Squadron on 25 August. Together with Iwate, the ship cruised to the western coasts of North and Central America, Hawaii and the South Sea Islands from 2 March to 6 July 1918.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 552, 657 Inter-war activities Asama being towed to sea off Australia, between 1923 and 1935 After World War I, Asama was used primarily for long range oceanic navigation training by officer candidates. On 21 August 1920, she began a training voyage to South America and Polynesia that lasted until 2 April 1921.Lacroix & Wells, p. 657 She was re-designated a 1st class coast defense ship on 1 September 1921. In 1922, all of her main deck guns, six 6-inch and four 12-pounder guns, were removed and their casemates plated over. In addition all of her QF 2.5-pounder guns were removed and a single 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft gun was added.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 73 Beginning on 26 June 1922, Asama resumed making training cruises, usually at two-year intervals, that took her to Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Sea among other places. They came to an end after she ran aground on the night of 13 October 1935 north north-west of the Kurushima Strait in the Inland Sea. Her bottom was badly damaged and she was deemed no longer seaworthy after repairs were completed at Kure Naval Arsenal. The ship was then assigned as a stationary training ship for the Kure Naval Corps on 5 July 1938.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 657‚Äì59 World War II Asama on 25 August 1946 Asama was reclassified as a training ship in July 1942Fukui, p. 53 and was towed to Shimonoseki 5 August 1942 where she became a gunnery training ship. She was disarmed at some point during the Pacific War, only retaining several 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft guns, and she was stricken from the navy list on 30 November 1945. The ship was scrapped at the Innoshima shipyard of the Hitachi Zosen Corporation from 15 August 1946 to 25 March 1947.

Due to him accepting the post there was a disagreement between him and Habib Elmasry who was the secretary of the General Congregation Council (Elmagles Elmelly Ela'am) of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria at some stage. Mr Elmasry was the father of the Coptic historian Iris Habib Elmasry and she had documented these incidents in her book about the history of the Coptic Orthodox Church. During his pontificate, he did not ordain any bishops or metropolitans and this was taken as a symbol of his regretting accepting the position of Pope of Alexandria despite being a metropolitan beforehand. He issued a document on 22 February 1944, its primary purpose was to repair monasteries and update the monks scientifically and spiritually, and to hold monastic heads accountable. This led to a major split between the Holy Synod and General Congregation Council (Elmagles Elmelly Ela'am). On 7 June 1944, the Holy Synod submitted an appeal to the Pope and to the Minister of Justice on the personal status law for non-Muslims Egyptians, because it contradicted a canon of the Coptic Church and also affected 2 of the holy mysteries of the Church, that of marriage and priesthood.

Based on an idea by Jojiro Okami, the film is a story of mankind's efforts to move Earth out of its orbit to prevent it from colliding with a runaway white dwarf star. The film was extensively edited for its American release. Plot Early in 1979, Japan's most famed rocketship, the JX-1 Hawk, with its crew of 30, is launched from the Interstellar Exploration Agency‚Äôs rocket launch site at Mt. Fuji into space on a nine-month journey to investigate the planet Saturn. After the journey, the crew is given a new mission directive from Earth. It was discovered that a small, runaway \\"planet\\" (which some scientists believed to be the solid mega-dense core of a collapsed star) had somehow run amok. It is given the name \\"Gorath\\" by the International Astronomical Union. Upon encountering Gorath and attempting to investigate its rapid movement in the Solar System, they discover that Gorath is smaller than Earth but with 6,000 times Earth's gravity. The JX-1 is caught in its gravity well and its crew loses their lives as the enormous gravity well of the approaching celestial body destroys the ship. Back on Earth during the Christmas season, the transmitted data made its way back to Earth. A month later in 1980, astronomers and astrophysicists throughout the international community announce that the enormous celestial body will collide with the Earth in two years time. At the United Nations, a gathering of Earth‚Äôs top scientists resolved this situation by pooling large amounts of technical advancements they made in the past two decades. After much debriefing, the scientific community unveils their plan to save the Earth. They call it the South Pole Operation. The South Pole Operation base is to be designed to house a large international team of engineers and scientists. The plan involves the construction of huge rocket thruster engines, 500 meters below the surface and in an area 600 kilometers in diameter, producing an atomic force equal to that of 6,600,000,000 megatons. When completed and activated, these mega-thrusters would move the Earth more than 400,000 kilometers out of its orbit in 100 days until it was safely out of range of the approaching Gorath and its devastating gravity, and then move the Earth back into its proper orbit once the danger had passed. The U.N. then sends the remaining prototype sub-light spacecraft JX-2 Eagle into space to obtain further data on Gorath. Construction on the massive South Pole base is put into action as ships and helicopters from many nations bring in building material. In addition, powerful mobile heat- generating devices known as atomic burrowers are quickly cobbled together to assist in creating the caverns in the icy terrain of Antarctica that will be needed to house the booster rockets. Meanwhile, in deep space, the JX-2 Eagle succeeds in its mission. The data they acquired, including the disturbing fact that Gorath was continuously adding to its mass by absorbing more space debris in the path of its gravity well, is sent to the U.N. personnel on the space stations SSS-1, Terra, and Delta. Back on Earth, the first preliminary test of the rocket thrusters is about to commence. Around the world, citizens watch live television broadcasts of the event. The thrusters are activated and the results are witnessed from orbiting space stations as the Earth is gently moving. The South Pole Operation is hailed as a success and the Earth is moving out of the way of Gorath's path. Meanwhile, in space, with this news, the JX-2 Eagle is ordered to return to its base on Earth, along with the three space stations (all of which were moved to avoid having the multi-billion- dollar constructs being struck by Gorath when it approached the Earth). Back on Earth, an unexpected threat is literally unearthed when the completed rocket boosters were tested. The backlash of incredible heat this created caused a gigantic, 30-meter-long walrus to emerge from its home deep below the frozen tundra (this creature was named 'Maguma' in Japanese press information about this incident; Maguma was evidently a hidden remnant of prehistoric creatures that survived into modern times). Angered by the dramatic intrusion into his home, Maguma begins attacking the U.N. base. Acting to save the installation, a small VTOL craft that was used as fast cargo transport, but equipped with a powerful laser, is sent to stop the assault. The pilot is determined to stop the creature without killing him and initially uses the laser cannon to cause an avalanche that buries the beast. Maguma easily escapes, however, and continues his attack. This leaves the South Pole crew no other choice but to turn the craft's deadly laser beam on the creature, and the enormous animal is killed. Back in deep space, Gorath is continuing its destructive path, now absorbing the rings of Saturn. The JX-2 Eagle and its crew finally arrive back on Earth. Sometime later, Gorath is close enough to the Earth to be seen by the naked eye and the atmosphere is reacting as clouds are drawn toward the rogue planet. Tides begin to rise and a state of emergency is declared. The Moon is pulled in by Gorath's gravity and is obliterated. Gorath's full effect upon the Earth is felt as Tokyo is flooded by a tsunami. At the Interstellar Exploration Agency launch site at Mt. Fuji, the JX-2 and the space station Terra are destroyed by an earthquake. The situation also becomes critical at the South Pole Operation base, as flooding waters enter the thruster area, extinguishing several fires. After the critical moment passes, the full cooperation of every nation on the planet succeeds marvelously and Earth is moved out of Gorath's path, and then successfully returned into its normal orbit, thus saving the planet from destruction.

He is often confused with another genre painter also called Egbert van Heemskerk III who lived ‚Äì 1744. Biography Attempts to distinguish the work of the elder and younger Heemskerck, where they overlap, have as yet been unsuccessful. An even older Egbert van Heemskerk, often reported to have lived from 1610‚Äì1680, may not have existed. Egbert van Heemskerck the Younger was born between 1666 and 1686 and died in 1744, the locations apparently unknown, but he worked in London for John Wilmor, Earl of Rochester in 1670. Egbert Jaspersz van Heemskerck or Egbert van Heemskerck the Elder (1634-1704) was born in Haarlem to the doctor Jasper Jaspersz van Heemskerck and his wife Marytge Jansdr van Stralen.Egbert Heemskerck I in the RKD After his father's death, his mother Marytge married the art dealer Jan Wijnants in 1651. This art dealer was the father of the landscape painter Jan Wijnants, making Jan and Egbert stepbrothers. He became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1646 and has been reported to be a student of Pieter de Grebber. Though listed in 1646, he may have become a member in 1664 (a year suspiciously lacking member registrations), like other members mistakenly registered in 1646, such as Evert Collier and Evert Oudendijck.De archiefbescheiden van het St. Lukasgilde te Haarlem 1497-1798, Hessel Miedema, 1980, In Haarlem in 1663 he declared himself to be 28, and in 1665, he declared himself to be 31 years old. In the early 1680s he moved to London, where one of his often satirical paintings apparently landed him in serious trouble with King Charles II of England. Though he is registered as having died in London in 1704, he was listed by Laurens van der Vinne as one of the painters who had predeceased his father in 1702. Various paintings are exhibited in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Louvre in Paris, the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts in Tournai, the Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle, the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

(from the initial letters of Podosfairikes Omades Kentrou, Greek: Œ†ŒøŒ¥ŒøœÉœÜŒ±ŒπœÅŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒüŒºŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøœÖ, English: Central Football Teams) was a coalition, a kind of an athletic trust, of the three main football teams of the Greater Athens area (the \\"big three\\") which lasted until the mid 60's. The term dates to in 1927, when Olympiacos F.C., Panathinaikos F.C. and AEK F.C. withdrew from the Greek Championship after disagreements with the Hellenic Football Federation (HFF), mainly over the championship's financial status. The HFF determined that league's revenues would be equally divided between all teams that participated. Olympiacos, Panathinaikos and AEK did not agree with this, and formed a group called P.O.K. During that season, they played friendly matches with each other. The name P.O.K. is currently used to allude to the continuing dominance of the three clubs in the National A Division. Rarely does a team outside these three finish in the top three spots of the Championship; doing so is called \\"breaking the P.O.K.\\". Since 1928, only three other teams - Aris F.C., AE Larissa and PAOK FC - have won the Greek Championship. The last-named is considered the main team that has \\"broken the P.O.K.\\", most recently having finished first and unbeaten in the 2018-19 season, leaving Olympiacos and AEK in second and third places and Panathinaikos in the eight place. Establishment In 1927/28, EEA (Committee of Professional Sports: Greek, ŒïœÄŒπœÑœÅŒøœÄŒÆ ŒïœÄŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œøœç ŒëŒ∏ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπœÉŒºŒøœç) established the first football championship in Greece with teams of the three founding football associations: E.P.S. Athens, E.P.S. Piraeus and E.P.S. Macedonia. Before the season had begun, EEA ordered other teams not to play against Olympiakos, as they were punished by the Hellenic Football Federation. Panathinaikos and AEK did not obey and organized friendly matches. This was reportedly part of a dispute between these three clubs and the league administration for control of the league. As a consequence, the EEA dropped all three clubs on October 31, 1927, and organized the league without them. The teams that took their place were Atromitos F.C. from Athens, Ethnikos Piraeus from Piraeus, and Aris FC from Thessaloniki. Activities The teams that constituted the P.O.K. tried to weaken the EEA, holding their championship with the participation of some other smaller clubs, although the majority of clubs continued under the official administration of EEA. They also organized various tournaments, during which they invited other foreign football clubs from Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania, such as Ferencv√°ros, OFK Beograd etc. The three clubs shared the costs of hosting as well as the revenue from tickets sold. The tournaments organized for the Christmas and Easter holidays were respectively called the Cup and the Easter Cup. They were financially very successful, as the three clubs were supported by the majority of fans in the Athens area. These tournaments continued even after the war when relations with the EEA had again resumed. The end of conflict In July 1928 the EEA made the decision to reinstate the three major clubs. However, this decision did not mark the end of the collaboration since the clubs recognized that they had vested interests in each other. Essentially, this continued until the establishment of professional football. Some areas of cooperation were: * The organization of the Easter and Christmas cups by each one of them in succession with the invitation of foreign clubs until the late 1950s. * Dissuasion of transfers from one club to another and particularly between Olympiacos and Panathinaikos, even for athletes of other sports, except football. * Mutual help in the elections for the administration of EEA and the decisions of the Board. The climax occurred in 1976, when the representative of the Olympic committee responsible for the next to vote saved, from demotion, Panathinaikos through bribery of the player I. Hercules, which has become known as the \\"Case of flowers\\". Easter Cup The first Easter Cup was organized by P.O.K. in 1928 with the participation of the Serbian and Romanian Beogradski benzo corps. It continued, with interruptions, until 1964. Of the 22 total events that took place, one was stopped before completion in 1948. After Olympiacos, who won the cup 10 times, came AEK and Panathinaikos with four wins each. Finally, with one win each, were Ethnikos Piraeus, German team Cologne RT, and Romanian team Progkresoul Bucharest. From 1930 to 1935 there were no events held due to obligations of the top clubs (POK) on the national stage, but the three POK teams continued to play each other in the stadium of Alexandras Avenue during Easter.

Organized with the participation of foreign clubs and the three clubs of P.O.K., this continued with various interruptions until 1962. All in all, there were 17 events held plus one (in 1951) which was stopped before completion. The team with the most wins (nine) was Olympiacos, while AEK emerged victorious three times, Panathinaikos twice and in the case of two events there was no winner (cancelled in accord with all participants).

As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the ship was built in Britain. She played minor roles in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 and World War I, but was very active during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05 where she participated in the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle off Ulsan, and the Battle of Tsushima. After the war she was sometimes used as a training ship for naval cadets. Tokiwa was converted into a minelayer in 1922‚Äì24. She was placed in reserve in 1927 after she was damaged by an accidental explosion of several mines. The ship was deployed to Northern China in 1932‚Äì33 after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. After her refit in 1937, Tokiwa returned to active duty and was assigned to the 4th Fleet in 1939. During the Pacific War, she participated in the occupation of the Gilbert Islands and Rabaul and Kavieng in New Guinea. Damaged by American aircraft shortly afterwards, the ship was forced to return to Japan for repairs. Tokiwa laid minefields during 1944‚Äì45 until she was twice damaged by American mines in 1945. After repairs were completed, the ship was badly damaged by American aircraft and her crew was forced to beach her lest she sink shortly before the end of the war. Tokiwa was salvaged in 1947 and subsequently broken up for scrap.  Background and description The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan was made after the First Sino-Japanese War and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships, all of which had to be ordered from British shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships. The revised plan is commonly known as the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\".Evans & Peattie, pp. 57‚Äì62 Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes, Tokiwa and her half- sisters were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline.Milanovich, p. 72 The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars. She had a beam of and had an average draft of . Tokiwa displaced at normal load and at deep load. The ship had a metacentric height of .Milanovich, pp. 74, 80 Her crew consisted of 676 officers and enlisted men.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 72 Tokiwa had two 4-cylinder triple- expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller shaft.Milanovich, p. 81 Steam for the engines was provided by a dozen cylindrical boilers and the engines were rated at a total of . The ship had a designed speed of and reached during her sea trials from . She carried up to of coalBrook 1999, p. 109 and could steam for at a speed of . The main armament for all of the \\"Six- Six Fleet\\" armored cruisers was four eight-inch guns in twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The secondary armament consisted of 14 Elswick Ordnance Company \\"Pattern Z\\" quick-firing (QF), guns. Only four of these guns were not mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields. Tokiwa was also equipped with a dozen QF 12-pounder 12-cwt guns\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. and eight QF 2.5-pounder Yamauchi guns as close-range defense against torpedo boats. The ship was equipped with five torpedo tubes, one above water in the bow and four submerged tubes, two on each broadside.Milanovich, p. 78 All of the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\" armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences, of which the most important was that the two Asama-class ships used less tough Harvey armor. The waterline belt ran the full length of the ship and its thickness varied from amidships to at the bow and stern. It had a height of , of which was normally underwater. The upper strake of belt armor was thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck. It extended from the forward to the rear barbette. The Asama class had oblique 127 mm armored bulkheads that closed off the ends of the central armored citadel.Milanovich, pp. 80‚Äì81 The barbettes, gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 152 millimeters thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by of armor. The deck was also 51 millimeters thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was in thickness.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 224 Construction and career The contract for Tokiwa was signed on 6 July 1897 with Armstrong Whitworth. The ship had already been laid down at their shipyard in Elswick on 6 January 1897 as a speculative venture. She was launched on 6 July 1898 and completed on 18 May 1899. The ship departed for Japan the next day and arrived in Yokosuka on 16 July.Milanovich, p. 73 Captain Dewa Shiget≈ç had been appointed on 5 April to supervise her construction and bring her to Japan. He was relieved of command after his arrival by Captain Nakayama Nagaaki.Hackett & Kingsepp The following year, Tokiwa supported Japanese forces during the Boxer Rebellion in China.Dix, p. 307 Russo-Japanese War Tokiwa anchored in 1904 Sublieutenant Kichisabur≈ç Nomura, later Foreign Minister, was appointed to the ship in July 1903 until the ship's return after the Battle off Ulsan in August 1904.Mauch, pp. 25‚Äì27 Captain Yoshimatsu Motaro assumed command of Tokiwa on 18 January 1904. At the start of the Russo-Japanese War a few weeks later, the ship was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet.Kowner, p. 465 She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. T≈çg≈ç had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. T≈çg≈ç chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect.Forczyk, pp. 42‚Äì43 Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before T≈çg≈ç disengaged.Corbett, I, p. 105 In early March, Tokiwa was detached from the 2nd Division and reassigned to Rear Admiral Dewa's 3rd Division. On 10 March, Tokiwa and the protected cruiser attempted to capture the disabled destroyer , but were driven off by heavy fire from the shore defenses, although they managed to rescue the wounded crewmen.Corbett, I, pp. 142, 149‚Äì50 T≈çg≈ç successfully lured out a portion of the Russian Pacific Squadron on 13 April, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, the battleship . During this action, Tokiwa engaged the Russian cruisers that preceded the battleships before falling back on T≈çg≈ç's battleships.Warner & Warner, pp. 236‚Äì38 When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur and his flagship ran into the minefield just laid by the Japanese. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. In addition to this loss, the battleship was damaged by a mine.Forczyk, pp. 45‚Äì46 Tokiwa rejoined the 2nd Division a few days later and Kamimura was ordered north in mid-April to cover the Sea of Japan and defend the Korea Strait against any attempt by the Vladivostok Independent Cruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen, to break through and unite with the Pacific Squadron. The two units narrowly missed each other on the 24th in heavy fog and the Japanese proceeded to Vladivostok where they laid several minefields before arriving back at Wonsan on the 30th.Corbett, I, pp. 188‚Äì89, 191‚Äì96 The division failed to intercept the Russian squadron as it attacked several transports south of Okinoshima Island on 15 June due to heavy rain and fog. The Russians sortied again on 30 June and Kamimura finally was able to intercept them the next day near Okinoshima. The light was failing when they were spotted and the Russians were able to disengage in the darkness. Jessen's ships sortied again on 17 July headed for the eastern coast of Japan to act as a diversion and pull Japanese forces out of the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. The Russian ships passed through Tsugaru Strait two days later and began capturing ships bound for Japan. The arrival of the Russians off Tokyo Bay on the 24th caused the Naval General Staff to order Kamimura to sail for Cape Toi Misaki, Ky≈´sh≈´, fearing that Jessen would circumnavigate Japan to reach Port Arthur. Two days later he was ordered north to the Kii Channel and then to Tokyo Bay on the 28th. The General Staff finally ordered him back to Tsushima Island on the 30th; later that day he received word that Jessen's ships had passed through the Tsugaru Strait early that morning and reached Vladivostok on 1 August.Corbett, I, pp. 283‚Äì89, 319‚Äì25, 337‚Äì51 =Battle off Ulsan= At anchor in a 1905 postcard On 10 August, the ships at Port Arthur attempted a breakout to Vladivostok, but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them, but the order was delayed. His three armored cruisers, , , and , had to raise steam, so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August. By dawn he had reached Tsushima, but turned back when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron. north of the island he encountered Kamimura's squadron, which consisted of four modern armored cruisers, , , , and Tokiwa. The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting one another and each had reversed course around first light. This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok.Brook 2000, pp. 34, 37 Jessen ordered his ships to turn to the northeast when he spotted the Japanese at 05:00 and they followed suit, albeit on a slightly converging course. Both sides opened fire around 05:23 at a range of . The Japanese ships concentrated their fire on Rurik, the rear ship of the Russian formation. She was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern of the other two ships. Jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open the range, but this blinded the Russian gunners with the rising sun and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on the Japanese. About 06:00, Jessen turned 180¬∞ to starboard in an attempt to reach the Korean coast and to allow Rurik to rejoin the squadron. Kamimura followed suit around 06:10, but turned to port, which opened the range between the squadrons. Azuma then developed engine problems and the Japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed. Firing recommenced at 06:24 and Rurik was hit three times in the stern, flooding her steering compartment; she had to be steered with her engines. Her speed continued to decrease, further exposing her to Japanese fire, and her steering jammed to port around 06:40.Brook 2000, pp. 39, 43 Jessen made another 180¬∞ turn in an attempt to interpose his two ships between the Japanese and Rurik, but the latter ship suddenly turn to starboard and increased speed and passed between Jessen's ships and the Japanese. Kamimura turned 180¬∞ as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses, but Jessen quickly made another 180¬∞ turn so that they headed on opposing courses. The Russians reversed course for the third time around 07:45 in another attempt to support Rurik although Rossia was on fire herself; her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later. Kamimura circled Rurik to the south at 08:00 and allowed the other two Russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to Vladivostok. Despite this, Jessen turned back once more at 08:15 and ordered Rurik to make her own way back to Vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed, about .Brook 2000, p. 43 About this time Kamimura's two elderly protected cruisers, and , were approaching from the south. Their arrival allowed Kamimura to pursue Jessen with all of his armored cruisers while the two new arrivals dealt with Rurik. They fought a running battle with the Russians for the next hour and a half; scoring enough hits on them to force their speed down to . Azumas engines again broke down during this chase and Tokiwa assumed her place in the line. The Japanese closed to a minimum of about , but Kamimura then opened the range up to . About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously informed him that Izumo had expended three- quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He did not wish to leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. None of the Japanese ships were seriously damaged and Tokiwa only suffered three men wounded during the battle.Brook 2000, pp. 43, 45 After the battle the cruiser was transferred to Rear Admiral Ury≈´ Sotokichi's command who began a blockade of Shanghai on 20 August where the and a destroyer had taken refuge after the Battle of the Yellow Sea. He returned home on 8 September after the Chinese government formally interned the Russian ships.Corbett, I, p. 457 In mid- September, Tokiwa and Iwate were transferred to the 1st Division. In November the cruiser was sent to the Kure Naval Arsenal to refit. The ship was reassigned to the 2nd Division after the refit, which was ordered north to Wonsan on 2 February to escort the occupation force there. Tokiwa was ordered home on 12 February for another refit. On 13 April, the 2nd Division, including the armored cruisers Izumo and , sailed to escort minelayers as they laid 715 mines off Vladivostok.Corbett, II, pp. 52, 97, 159‚Äì60, 177 =Battle of Tsushima= Japanese postcard of Tokiwa at speed, circa 1905 As the Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons approached Japan on 27 May, having sailed from the Baltic Sea, they were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning, but visibility was limited and radio reception poor. The preliminary reports were enough to cause T≈çg≈ç to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships under the command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky at around 11:30. Kamimura closed to about a range of before sheering off under fire to join T≈çg≈ç's battleships.Corbett, II, pp. 232, 235 Tokiwa was third in line of six when T≈çg≈ç opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14:10 and, like most of the ships in the division, engaged the battleship which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later. By this time the Russian formation was in disorder and Knyaz Suvorov suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15:35 at a range of about . All of Kamimura's ships engaged her for five minutes or so with Azuma and the armored cruiser also firing torpedoes at the Russian ship without effect.Campbell, Part 2, pp. 128‚Äì32 After 17:30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers, leaving T≈çg≈ç's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin T≈çg≈ç. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to . Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined T≈çg≈ç at 20:08 as night was falling.Campbell, Part 3, pp. 186‚Äì87 The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range.Corbett, II, pp. 319‚Äì20 Over the course of the battle, Tokiwa was struck by one large and seven small shells, mostly 75-millimeter. They caused only minor damage,Campbell, Part 4, p. 263 but killed one crewman and wounded fourteen.Watts & Gordon, p. 109 Captain Imai Kanemasa assumed command of the ship on 14 June, as T≈çg≈ç was reorganizing the fleet for future operations. As the IJN was preparing to invade Sakhalin Island in early July, Kamimura's 2nd Division, now reduced to Iwate, Izumo, and Tokiwa, was tasked to defend the Korea Strait before it escorted troops that made an amphibious landing in northeastern Korea. In mid-August, the division covered the landing at Chongjin, closer to the Russian border.Corbett, II, pp. 356, 363‚Äì65, 377‚Äì80 In 1910, Tokiwas boilers were replaced by Miyabara water-tube boilers and her six-inch guns were replaced by Japanese-built models. In December 1911, Iwate and Tokiwa were deployed to Port Arthur to keep order there during the Chinese Revolution.Mauch, p. 38 World War I The ship participated in the early stages of the Battle of Tsingtao before returning to Sasebo on 2 October 1914.Burdick, pp. 235, 241 The following month, Tokiwa was deployed to Singapore preparatory to searching for the German commerce raider , but the German ship was sunk before the mission began.Halpern, p. 75 The cruiser was assigned to the Training Squadron on 1 September 1916 preparatory to her departure on 5 April 1917 with Yakumo on a training cruise to ports in California, Hawaii and the South Sea Islands with cadets from the 44th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. After her return on 17 August, the ship was relieved of her assignment to the Training Squadron on 25 AugustLacroix & Wells, p. 657 and sent to Honolulu, Hawaii in October to protect shipping from any German commerce raiders and to allow the US Navy to redeploy its forces to the Atlantic.Saxon Tokiwa was reassigned to the Training Squadron on 10 August 1918 and returned home to prepare for her next training cruise, together with Azuma, that began on 1 March 1919 for South Asia and Australia and again on 24 November 1919, also with Azuma, for Singapore, Southeast Asia, Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. After her return on 20 May 1920, the ship was relieved of her assignment to the Training Squadron on 4 June. Tokiwa was reclassified as a 1st class coast-defense ship on 30 September 1921. Converted into a minelayer On 30 September 1922, Tokiwa began her conversion into a minelayer at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. To accommodate her 200‚Äì300 mines, her rear 8-inch gun turret removed, as were the six 6-inch guns on the main deck. In addition, the number of light guns was reduced to two 12-pounders, although two 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. These modifications were completed in March 1924. The ship's stern suffered substantial damage in an accidental explosion in Saiki Bay on 1 August 1927 when fuzed mines were being disarmed. One mine detonated and then several others followed, killing 35 crewmen and wounding 65. Tokiwa was assigned to the reserve fleet after repairs. Tokiwa was assigned to the 1st Fleet from January 1932 to May 1933 after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and patrolled northern China. From November 1937 to 1938, the ship was retrofitted with eight Kampon boilers that reduced her maximum speed to and her remaining torpedo tubes were removed. The space made available by these changes increased her capacity to 500 mines. With the establishment of the 4th Fleet on 15 November 1939, Tokiwa was assigned to the 18th Division, and a year later to the 19th Division under the command of Rear Admiral Kiyohide Shima together with the minelayer . In 1940, the ship was refitted as a training minelayer which reduced her capacity to 200-300 mines. As part of the refit, her forward 8-inch gun turret and the four amidships 6-inch guns were removed, as was one of the 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type AA guns. Her anti-aircraft armament was heavily reinforced with the addition of two single guns and twenty license-built Hotchkiss 25-millimeter Type 96 light AA guns in twin-gun mounts.Chesneau, p. 207 Pacific War On 9 and 10 December 1941, Tokiwa and the other minelayers of the 19th Division escorted two troop transports that carried the occupation forces for Makin and Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands.Rohwer, p. 123 In January 1942, the ship participated in Operation R (the invasion of Rabaul and Kavieng) and returned to Kwajalein Atoll afterwards. She was damaged in an air raid by American aircraft from the carrier on 1 February 1942 and forced to return to Sasebo for repairs. Tokiwa returned to Truk on 14 July, and, on 19 August, was assigned to the Japanese task force sent to reoccupy Makin Atoll after the Makin Raid. On 1 May 1943, the ship was reassigned to the ≈åminato Guard District and departed Truk on 26 May in a convoy to Yokosuka that was unsuccessfully attacked by on 3 June. Tokiwa was reassigned to the 18th Escort Squadron of the 7th Fleet on 20 January 1944. Tokiwa laid thousands of mines in the waters off Okinawa in June 1944 and Yakushima in February 1945. Ironically, Tokiwa was herself mined on 14 April 1945, approximately off Hesaki, Ky≈´sh≈´ suffering moderate damage. She was later damaged again by mines laid by USAAF B-29 Superfortress bombers on 3 June 1945. At some point during the war, her armament was augmented with approximately ten 25 mm Type 96 AA guns in single mounts and 80 depth charges. In addition she was fitted with Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 and Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radars.Fukui, p. 13 Wrecked at the end of World War II While at ≈åminato in Mutsu Bay in northern Japan at , Tokiwa was severely damaged by a direct bomb hit and four near misses in an air attack on 9 August 1945 by United States Navy aircraft from Task Force 38, and was beached by her crew. On 30 November 1945 Tokiwa was removed from the navy list. After the end of World War II, the wreck was refloated on 5 April 1947, towed to Hakodate, Hokkaid≈ç, and scrapped from August‚ÄìOctober 1947.

As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself, the ship was built in Britain. She often served as a flagship and participated in most of the naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05. The ship was lightly damaged during the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima. Izumo was ordered to protect Japanese citizens and interests in 1913 during the Mexican Revolution and was still there when World War I began in 1914. She was then tasked to search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping off the western coasts of North and Central America. The ship assisted the armored cruiser in early 1915 when she struck a rock off Baja California. In 1917, Izumo became the flagship of the Japanese squadron deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. After the war, she sailed to Great Britain to take control of some ex-German submarines and then escorted them part of the way back to Japan. The ship spent most of the 1920s as a training ship for naval cadets and became flagship of the IJN's China forces in 1932 during the First Shanghai Incident. Izumo participated in the Battle of Shanghai five years later and was not damaged, despite repeated aerial attacks. The ship played a minor role in the Pacific War, supporting Japanese forces during Philippines Campaign until she struck a mine. She returned to Japan in 1943 and again became a training ship for naval cadets. Izumo was sunk by American carrier aircraft during the attack on Kure in July 1945. Her wreck was refloated and scrapped in 1947. Background and description The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan was made after the First Sino-Japanese War and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships, all of which had to be ordered from British shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships. The revised plan is commonly known as the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\".Evans & Peattie, pp. 57‚Äì62 Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes, Izumo and her half-sisters were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline.Milanovich, p. 72 The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars. She had a beam of and had an average draft of . Izumo displaced at normal load and at deep load. The ship had a metacentric height of .Milanovich, pp. 74, 80 Her crew consisted of 672 officers and enlisted men.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 74 Izumo had two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller shaft.Milanovich, p. 81 Steam for the engines was provided by 24 Belleville boilers and the engines were rated at a total of . The ship had a designed speed of and reached during her sea trials from . She carried up to of coalBrook 1999, p. 112 and could steam for at a speed of . The main armament for all of the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\" armored cruisers was four eight-inch guns in twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The secondary armament consisted of 14 Elswick Ordnance Company \\"Pattern Z\\" quick-firing (QF), guns. Only four of these guns were not mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields. Izumo was also equipped with a dozen QF 12-pounder 12-cwt guns\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. and eight QF 2.5-pounder Yamauchi guns as close-range defense against torpedo boats. The ship was equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.Milanovich, p. 78 All of the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\" armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences. The waterline belt of Krupp cemented armor ran the full length of the ship and its thickness varied from amidships to at the bow and stern. It had a height of , of which was normally underwater. The upper strake of belt armor was thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck. It extended from the forward to the rear barbette. The Izumo class had oblique 127 mm armored bulkheads that closed off the ends of the central armored citadel.Milanovich, pp. 80‚Äì81 The barbettes, gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 6 inches thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by of armor. The deck was thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was in thickness.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 225 Construction and career Izumo at anchor in 1902 The contract for Izumo, named after the eponymous province,Silverstone, p. 331 was signed on 24 September 1897 with Armstrong Whitworth. The ship was laid down at their shipyard in Elswick on 14 May 1898 and launched on 19 September. She was completed on 25 September 1900 and departed for Japan on 2 OctoberMilanovich, p. 73 under the command of Captain Inoue Toshio, who had been appointed to supervise her construction and bring her back to Japan on 29 September 1899. Izumo arrived in Yokosuka on 8 December and Inoue was confirmed in his command.Hackett & Kingsepp Russo- Japanese War At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Izumo, now under the command of Captain Miyaoka Naoki, was the flagship of Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonoj≈ç, commander of the 2nd Fleet.Kowner, p. 465 She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. T≈çg≈ç had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. T≈çg≈ç chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect.Forczyk, pp. 42‚Äì43 Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before T≈çg≈ç disengaged.Corbett, I, p. 105 In early March, Kamimura was tasked to take the reinforced 2nd Division north and make a diversion off Vladivostok. While scouting for Russian ships in the area, the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect. Upon their return to Japan a few days later, the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the Imperial Guards Division to Korea and then to join the ships blockading Port Arthur. Kamimura was ordered north in mid-April to cover the Sea of Japan and defend the Korea Strait against any attempt by the Vladivostok Independent Cruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen, to break through and unite with the Pacific Squadron. The two units narrowly missed each other on the 24th in heavy fog and the Japanese proceeded to Vladivostok where they laid several minefields before arriving back at Wonsan on the 30th.Corbett, I, pp. 138‚Äì39, 142‚Äì45, 160, 177, 188‚Äì89, 191‚Äì96 The division failed to intercept the Russian squadron as it attacked several transports south of Okinoshima Island on 15 June due to heavy rain and fog. The Russians sortied again on 30 June and Kamimura finally was able to intercept them the next day near Okinoshima. The light was failing when they were spotted and the Russians were able to disengage in the darkness. Jessen's ships sortied again on 17 July headed for the eastern coast of Japan to act as a diversion and pull Japanese forces out of the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. The Russian ships passed through Tsugaru Strait two days later and began capturing ships bound for Japan. The arrival of the Russians off Tokyo Bay on the 24th caused the Naval General Staff to order Kamimura to sail for Cape Toi Misaki, Ky≈´sh≈´, fearing that Jessen would circumnavigate Japan to reach Port Arthur. Two days later he was ordered north to the Kii Channel and then to Tokyo Bay on the 28th. The General Staff finally ordered him back to Tsushima Island on the 30th; later that day he received word that Jessen's ships had passed through the Tsugaru Strait early that morning and reached Vladivostok on 1 August.Corbett, I, pp. 283‚Äì89, 319‚Äì25, 337‚Äì51 =Battle off Ulsan= On 10 August, the ships at Port Arthur attempted a breakout to Vladivostok, but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them, but the order was delayed. His three armored cruisers, , , and , had to raise steam, so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August. By dawn he had reached Tsushima, but turned back when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron. north of the island he encountered Kamimura's squadron, which consisted of four modern armored cruisers, , , , and Izumo. The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting one another and each had reversed course around first light. This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok.Brook 2000, pp. 34, 37 Jessen ordered his ships to turn to the northeast when he spotted the Japanese at 05:00 and they followed suit, albeit on a slightly converging course. Both sides opened fire around 05:23 at a range of . The Japanese ships concentrated their fire on Rurik, the rear ship of the Russian formation. She was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern of the other two ships. Jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open the range, but this blinded the Russian gunners with the rising sun and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on the Japanese. About 06:00, Jessen turned 180¬∞ to starboard in an attempt to reach the Korean coast and to allow Rurik to rejoin the squadron. Kamimura followed suit around 06:10, but turned to port, which opened the range between the squadrons. Azuma then developed engine problems and the Japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed. Firing recommenced at 06:24 and Rurik was hit three times in the stern, flooding her steering compartment; she had to be steered with her engines. Her speed continued to decrease, further exposing her to Japanese fire, and her steering jammed to port around 06:40.Brook 2000, pp. 39, 43 Jessen made another 180¬∞ turn in an attempt to interpose his two ships between the Japanese and Rurik, but the latter ship suddenly turn to starboard and increased speed and passed between Jessen's ships and the Japanese. Kamimura turned 180¬∞ as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses, but Jessen quickly made another 180¬∞ turn so that they headed on opposing courses. The Russians reversed course for the third time around 07:45 in another attempt to support Rurik although Rossia was on fire herself; her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later. Kamimura circled Rurik to the south at 08:00 and allowed the other two Russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to Vladivostok. Despite this, Jessen turned back once more at 08:15 and ordered Rurik to make her own way back to Vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed, about .Brook 2000, p. 43 About this time Kamimura's two elderly protected cruisers, and , were approaching from the south. Their arrival allowed Kamimura to pursue Jessen with all of his armored cruisers while the two new arrivals dealt with Rurik. They fought a running battle with the Russians for the next hour and a half; scoring enough hits on them to force their speed down to . The Japanese closed to a minimum of about , but Kamimura then opened the range up to . About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously informed him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He did not wish to leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. None of the Japanese ships were seriously damaged; despite Izumo receiving over 20 hits, she only suffered 3 men killed and 16 wounded during the battle.Brook 2000, pp. 43, 45; Watts & Gordon, p. 117 She began repairs at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in mid- September.Corbett, II, p. 52 On 26 January 1905, Kamimura hoisted his flag again in Izumo at Sasebo and then escorted several troop convoys to Wonsan on February. On 13 April, the 2nd Division, including the armored cruisers Tokiwa and , sailed to escort minelayers as they laid 715 mines off Vladivostok.Corbett, II, pp. 159‚Äì61, 177 =Battle of Tsushima= As the Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons approached Japan on 27 May, having sailed from the Baltic Sea, they were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning, but visibility was limited and radio reception poor. The preliminary reports were enough to cause T≈çg≈ç to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships under the command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky at around 11:30. Kamimura closed to about a range of before sheering off under fire to join T≈çg≈ç's battleships.Corbett, II, pp. 232, 235 Izumo was leading the 2nd Division when T≈çg≈ç opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14:10 and, like most of the ships in the division, engaged the battleship which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later. By this time the Russian formation was in disorder and Knyaz Suvorov suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15:35 at a range of about . All of Kamimura's ships engaged her for five minutes or so with Azuma and the armored cruiser also firing torpedoes at the Russian ship without effect.Campbell, Part 2, pp. 128‚Äì32 After 17:30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers, leaving T≈çg≈ç's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin T≈çg≈ç. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to . Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined T≈çg≈ç at 20:08 as night was falling.Campbell, Part 3, pp. 186‚Äì87 The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range.Corbett, II, pp. 319‚Äì20 Over the course of the battle, Izumo was struck by five large shells, mostly 12-inch, and three smaller shells, mostly 6-inch. They caused only minor damage, although one 12-inch shell, which pierced a boiler uptake, could have disabled all of the middle boilers had it detonated.Campbell, Part 4, p. 263 The shells killed 4 men and wounded 26 others.Brook 1999, p. 113 As the IJN was preparing to invade Sakhalin Island in early July, Kamimura's 2nd Division, now reduced to Iwate, Izumo, and Tokiwa, was tasked to defend the Korea Strait before it escorted troops that made an amphibious landing in northeastern Korea. In mid-August, the division covered the landing at Chongjin, closer to the Russian border.Corbett, II, pp. 356, 363‚Äì65, 377‚Äì80 On 20 September 1909, under command of Captain Takeshita Isamu, Izumo departed Yokohama for the United States to participate in the Portola Festival at San Francisco, a citywide fair held on 19‚Äì23 October to mark the 140th anniversary of the Portol√† expedition, the first recorded Spanish (and European) land entry and exploration of present-day California, and to proclaim to the world that San Francisco was recovered from its devastating 1906 earthquake. Lieutenant Prince Shimazu Tadashige was assigned to the ship during this visit. Lieutenant Allen B. Reed, engineering officer on the and the future commissioning captain of the heavy cruiser was assigned as Captain Takeshita's escort during the ship's visit at San Francisco. Izumo made port calls in Hawaii, Monterrey, Santa Barbara, and San Diego en route. On 12 November 1913, Izumo was ordered to patrol the west coast of Mexico to safeguard Japanese interests and nationals during the Mexican Revolution. World War I When Japan declared war on the Central Powers in August 1914, Izumo was still off the Mexican coast and was ordered to protect Allied shipping there and search for German commerce raiders.Saxon On 1 November, the ship, then off San Francisco, was ordered to join a British task force commanded by Admiral Sir George Patey off San Clemente Island that included the battlecruiser and the light cruiser . After the German gunboat was interned by the Americans on 8 November, the ex-Russian battleship Hizen and Asama, which had been patrolling off Honolulu, Hawaii, to prevent the German ship from leaving, rendezvoused with the other ships of the American Expeditionary Squadron at Magdalena Bay, Baja California on 22 November. The squadron, now commanded by Rear Admiral Moriyama Keizaburo in Izumo, then headed south to search along the western coast of South America for German ships. On 11 December, after the receiving the news of the British victory in the Battle of the Falkland Islands, the squadron moved north to search off the western coast of Central America and then Mexican and U.S. waters in January.Estes While searching Baja California, Asama was badly damaged when she struck an uncharted rock on 31 January. Izumo, delayed by poor communications, arrived on 12 February and Moriyama radioed for repair and salvage ships to be sent from Japan. Izumo was relieved by Tokiwa on 19 March and the ship returned home. Izumo relieved the protected cruiser in June 1917 at Malta as the flagship of Rear Admiral K≈çz≈ç Sat≈ç, commander of the Second Special Mission Squadron that controlled the Japanese destroyers that escorted convoys in the Mediterranean Sea. In December 1918, Izumo, accompanied by the destroyers and , sailed from Malta to Scapa Flow to assume control of seven captured German U-boats as prizes of war. They returned to Malta with the U-boats in March 1919 and the armored cruiser accompanied eight destroyers and the U-boats to Japan, while Izumo made port calls at Naples, Genoa and Marseilles before arriving in Japan with the remaining destroyers on 2 July 1919. Interwar years Izumo at anchor in Vancouver, 1925 Izumo participated in the 1919 Naval Review by Emperor Taish≈ç. She was re-designated a 1st class coast-defense ship on 1 September 1921 and used primarily for training duties in long-distance oceanic navigation and officer training for cadets in the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy. In this capacity, she participated six voyages in the 1920s and 1930s to Europe, North and South America, and Oceania,Lacroix & Wells, pp. 657, 659 including a circumnavigation of the globe from August 1921 to April 1922 with Yakumo. Two of the naval cadets that participated in this cruise were Princes Kuni Asaakira and Kach≈ç Hirotada. While in Vancouver, British Columbia, on 7 February 1925, on one of these cruises, a tugboat collided with one of the ship's boats at night, drowning 11 crewmen. In 1924, four of Izumos 12-pounder guns were removed, as were all of her QF 2.5-pounder guns, and a single 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added. Refitted again in 1930‚Äì31, her torpedo tubes were removed as were all of her main deck 6-inch guns and their casemates plated over; she now carried only four 12-pounders.Chesneau, p. 174 In 1935 her boilers were replaced by six Kampon water-tube boilers with an output of only which reduced her top speed to .

The armored cruiser is anchored to the left. On 2 February 1932, during the First Shanghai Incident, Izumo became the flagship of the newly re-established 3rd Fleet under Admiral Kichisabur≈ç Nomura and arrived in Shanghai six days later.Mauch, p. 84 In 1934, Izumo was equipped to operate a floatplane at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. Shortly after the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, Izumo was attacked on 14 August 1937 in a series of raids by Chinese Air Force aircraft during the Battle of Shanghai. Most of the bombs landed in the river without effect, but two bombs landed among spectators, killing hundreds.Harmsen, pp. 56‚Äì62 Izumos Nakajima E4N floatplane and another from the light cruiser managed to get into the air and they claimed to have shot down one Curtiss Hawk biplane fighter and a Northrop Gamma bomber. Two days later, her E4N claimed to have shot down another Hawk.Hata, Shores & Izawa, p. 6 Izumo was attacked that same day by a Chinese torpedo boat, but the torpedoes missed and the boat was abandoned by its crew.Wright, p. 171 The ship provided naval gunfire support to Japanese troops ashore during the battle. Izumo was repeatedly attacked without effect by Chinese aircraft for the duration of the Battle of Shanghai. Izumo in Shanghai, 1937 Still in Shanghai at the beginning of the Pacific War on 8 December 1941, Izumo captured the American river gunboat and assisted in sinking the British river gunboat .Rohwer, p. 123 On 31 December, the cruiser struck a mine in the Lingayen Gulf while supporting Japanese forces during the Philippines Campaign. She was towed to Hong Kong in February 1942 for repairs. Izumo was re-classified as a 1st-class cruiser on 1 July. She returned to Japan in late 1943 and was reclassified as a training shipFukui, p. 4 for the Kure Naval District. On 19 March 1945, Izumo was attacked by American carrier aircraft off Etajima, although they failed to inflict any damage. Shortly afterwards, her 8-inch guns were replaced by four Type 89 dual-purpose guns in two twin mounts and four of her remaining 6-inch guns were removed. Her light anti-aircraft armament was significantly reinforced by the addition of 14 license-built Hotchkiss 25-millimeter Type 96 light AA guns in two triple, two twin, and four single-gun mounts and two 13.2-millimeter Hotchkiss machine guns in single mounts. The ship was damaged by an American mine on 9 April off Hiroshima.Rohwer, p. 408 Izumo was not attacked on the first day of the American aerial attack on Kure on 24 July 1945, but she was near missed three times four days later. The shockwave from the detonations sprang the ship's seams and the resulting flooding caused her to capsize at coordinates . She was removed from the navy list on 20 November and her hulk was raised and scrapped in 1947 by the Harima Dock Company.

The Pope He was the Metropolitan of Girga before becoming the Pope and he is the third Bishop / Metropolitan to become a Pope after Popes John XIX (1928‚Äì1942) and Macarius III (1942‚Äì1945).History of the Coptic Church, Iris Habib Elmasry Volume five. The Seat of the Pope in Cairo during his papacy remained in the Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Azbakeya, Cairo. Ethiopia He is revered in Ethiopia for having appointed the first Ethiopian-born metropolitan archbishop for the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church, and granting that church full autocephaly. His deposition by the Coptic Synod was not accepted by the Ethiopian Church, and the name of Pope Joseph II was still raised in church services in Ethiopia as patriarch long after he was removed from office. Work During Pope Yosab II's papacy the Institute of Coptic Studies was founded in 1954. by the Coptic Orthodox Church and based in Cairo. Between the years 1950‚Äì1952 A.D., in the time of Pope Yosab II, the building of Saint Mark's Church in Alexandria was pulled down ‚Äì as it was old ‚Äì and another bigger building was built with reinforced concrete after the basilique style. The six marble pillars were transferred into the outer entrance of the church. The iconostasis was accurately cut into parts, each part given a number, and then it was carefully returned to where it was originally. The two minarets were not pulled down as they were reinforced with concrete and were decorated with beautiful Coptic engravings. Two new bells ‚Äì brought from Italy ‚Äì were provided one for each minaret. Removal from office Pope Yousab II proved to be a weak and indecisive patriarch. During his reign, there were numerous power struggles within the church and corruption became widespread. Yousab's valet and secretary, Malik, acted as an intermediary between the Pope and the rest of the Church, and gradually assumed much of the Pope's power. According to various reports, Malik charged large sums of money for an audience with the Pope and sold at least sixteen of the nineteen episcopal appointments made during Yousab II's reign. Accusations of corruption and simony against Yousab II became common in the Egyptian press during this time, stirring up discontent among the Coptic laity. In July 1954, a group of political activists known as the Umma al-Qibtiya (Society of the Coptic Nation) staged a protest demanding that Yousab II resign. On July 25, 1954, the protest culminated in the group kidnapping the Pope and taking him to the Coptic Convent of Saint George in Old Cairo where he was forced to sign a letter of abdication. However, the police were able to rescue the Pope and return him to the patriarchal residence. A year later, the Church's Synod and the General Congregation Council agreed to remove Pope Yousab II from office, stating that he was not fit to execute his duties. He retired to one of the monasteries and in his last days he was transferred to the Coptic Hospital in Azbakeya, Cairo where he died in 1956. The Church was managed by a committee formed of three of the Metropolitans from 1956 to 1959. The committee included Metropolitans Mikhail of Assiut, Metropolitan Agapius Bishop of Dairut and Qasqam and Metropolitan Benyamine, Bishop of Monufia.

It was established in 1968. History Part of the current company's vineyards can be traced back to the winery Eshcol, a biblical word for ‚Äúlush cluster of grapes.‚Äù The original Eschol winery was commissioned by James and George Goodman and constructed in 1886 by a Scottish sea captain named Hamden McIntyre. The original estate was 280 acres with 40 acres planted in vineyards. McIntyre designed it as a gravity-flow system: a horse-drawn winch brought grapes to the third floor of the three-story structure for crushing; gravity carried the juice to the second floor for fermenting; and, eventually, the wine descended to the first floor for aging. The vineyards survived Prohibition in the United States by producing grapes for the production of sacramental wine. By 1940, the vineyards and winery building fell into disuse. The Eschol building suffered extensive structural damage from the 2014 South Napa earthquake. The winery building was restored from earthquake damage following over two years of repairs and improvements. Following retirement from a successful career with Kaiser Industries, Eugene Trefethen along with his wife Katie purchased Eshcol in 1968 along with six adjoining properties to create Trefethen Vineyards. At that time, replanting of the vineyards and restoration of the historic winery building began. The Trefethens' restoration efforts were recognized in 1988 by the Department of the Interior, which placed the winery on the National Register of Historic Places as the only 19th-century, wooden, gravity-flow winery surviving in Napa County. The winery is also known for an extensive garden established by Katie. It has been featured in many publications and has been a destination for many gardening enthusiasts since it was created. Eugene Trefethen died in 1996 and Katie Trefethen died in 2007. Awards In 1979, a Wine Olympics was organized by the French wine and food magazine, Gault Millau. A total of 330 wines from 33 countries were evaluated by 62 experts from ten countries. The 1976 Trefethen Vineyards Chardonnay won first place in that category and was judged best in the world.

Wajed Ali or Sheikh Wajid Ali (; 4 September 1890 ‚Äì 10 June 1951) was a Bengali writer, nationalist and barrister-at-law.  Early life  Wajid Ali was born on 4 September 1890 in the village of Baratajpur of Hooghly district. S. Wajed Ali's maternal grandmother hailed from the Nawabpur village in Chanditola of Hooghly district. S.Wajid Ali House Her father, who came from Mungaer, had settled in Nawabpur with a 'Jaigir' and married into the local Bengali community. Wajed Ali's three maternal uncles were 'Hafiz' in Koran and his grandfather's home atmosphere was one of religious conservatism. However, the natural beauty of Nawabpur touched him deeply as expressed in his memoirs. Wajed Ali's education began in the village 'Madrasa' or school. At this stage, in 1897 he had his first marriage, at the early age of seven, with his six- month-old cousin Ayesha (the daughter of his paternal uncle Sheikh Golam Rahman). In 1898, at the age of eight, Wajed Ali came to Shillong and started education under the tutelage of his father, S. Belayet Ali. Later, he was admitted to the English medium Mokhar School in Shillong, from where he graduated in his 'Entrance Exams' with a gold medal. This phase of his life in Shillong, Meghalaya had a lasting impression upon him. He went to Aligarh MAYO college, where he was recognised as a meritorious student. He subsequently passed his I.A. and B.A. exams from Allahabad University in 1908 and 1910 respectively. After his graduation from Allahabad, he returned to his village of Baratajpur and spent a happy family life amidst the rural idyllic surroundings. His first child, Lutfunnissa, was born at this time. He was trying hard to convince his family to allow him to go to England for further education. Finally, with the enthusiasm and recommendations of his second uncle, he succeeded in getting their permission and left for London just a couple of years before the start of World War I. Wajed Ali joined the Law school of the University of Cambridge, from where he attained his B.A. and Barrister-at-Law degrees.  Career = The beginnings  While in Cambridge, he had fallen seriously ill and Miss Eleanor Saxby of Bristol had come forward to take care of him, and enable his subsequent recovery. From this episode started a relationship between them which culminated in his second marriage and divorce from Ayesha Begum, at the obvious displeasure of his family members back home. The year was 1915 ‚Äì World War I was raging in Europe. It was at this time that S. Wajed Ali started the practice of Law in Calcutta High Court and continued till 1922. All this while, he lived with Eleanor in Mott Lane, Ripon Lane, Ripon Street etc. in Calcutta. Ill fortune struck when various factors of the failure of the family business, failing health, extravagant lifestyle ‚Äì all combined together to drive him to bankruptcy. He immersed himself in deep studies about the contemporary society and involved himself in the elite literary world of the time. At the advice of his friend, Pramatha Chowdhury (editor of weekly Shobuj Potro), he started writing in Bengali and began an extraordinary literary career.  1923 ‚Äì 1928  In 1923, he was appointed the third presidency magistrate of Calcutta and a few days later he started living with his family in No. 1 Canal Road in Calcutta. At this period he devoted himself to his literary pursuits. He expressed himself with supreme creative excellence in the fields of prose, symbolism, story-writing, translation, travelogues, etc. His troubled marriage with Mrs. Eleanor Saxby (Nellie) came to an end in 1928, when the mother of his two sons, Ahmed and Abdullah and daughter Zeb-un-Nissa separated from him and married his younger brother S. Shamsher Ali. This turn of events drove him into a family crisis and utter loneliness. The dramatic family complications made him hurt susceptible and psychologically isolated. In the face of all these adversities, he maintained his literary stability and creativity in matters of philosophical and nationalistic pursuits. He always maintained his clarity of vision and focus in all these matters, which were close to his heart.  1929 ‚Äì 1944  Having been cast into loneliness and isolation in his family life, S. Wajed Ali, amidst his otherwise busy life with the duties of his job, literary pursuits, chairmanships of various societies and organisations etc., was like a prisoner of pain on a lonely island. At this time he met a learned Burmese lady, who subsequently became his wife and life- partner, Mrs. Badrunnessa Ali. Descended from the line of Chengiz Khan, her father was the head of a Burmese royal family. When the British forces attacked Burma, most of the royal family men folk were killed in the anti- British struggle. Along with her mother and aunt, the Burmese princess Badrunnessa was brought to Calcutta as a royal war-prisoner. Unfortunately, a grave tragedy befell Mr. S. Wajed Ali's life only two years after his marriage, when on 26 October 1931, Mrs. Badrunnessa Ali died a day after the birth of her only child. Her body was buried in the 'Gobra graveyard'. An English nurse was appointed to take care of his new-born child, Sheikh Badruddin Ali (Zaib-un-Nissa was also quite young at the time). The founding of the magazine 'Gulistan' in December 1932 was an active and busy chapter of S. Wajed Ali's life. He built up around this magazine a cultural and literary circle embracing the cream of contemporary Bengali society. Its cover bore the vision behind its creation 'the pioneer of Hindu-Muslim unity'. The writer's list of 'Gulistan' bears evidence of the nobility, width of scope and seriousness of the magazine: Kazi Nazrul Islam, Dr. Mohammed Shahidullah, Kazi Abdul Wadud, KedƒÅrnƒÅth ChattopƒÅdhyƒÅy, TƒÅrƒÅ≈õankar BandyopƒÅdhyƒÅy, PramathanƒÅth Bishi, Buddhadeb Basu, SajanikƒÅnta DƒÅs (of ≈öanibƒÅrer Chithi fame), Kavi≈õekhar KƒÅlidƒÅs RƒÅy, BƒÅrindranƒÅth Ghosh, Pabitra GangopƒÅdhyƒÅy, Poet Kader Nawaz, Poet Nirmal DƒÅs, AnurupƒÅ Devƒ´, PrabhƒÅbatƒ´ Devƒ´ Sarasvatƒ´, IndirƒÅ Devƒ´caudhurƒÅni, ManilƒÅl Bannerjee, A. K. Jainal Abedin (Navayug), Humayun Kabir, Comrade Abdul Aziz, PhanindranƒÅth MukhopƒÅdhyƒÅy, Dhƒ´rƒÅj BhattacƒÅrya, Saurƒ´ndramohan MukhopadhyƒÅy, Abbasuddin Ahmed etc. At these heady times, S. Wajed Ali's residence at 48, Jhowtalla Road, was the usual venue for the Gulistan-centred literary evening gatherings. The contemporary elite of the intellectual, literary and art world of Calcutta were often present in those sessions. Besides being the founder of the 'Gulistan' magazine, S. Wajed Ali was also the publisher and editor of the English language magazine: 'Bulletin of the Indian Rationalistic Society'.  Retirement  On 31 October 1945, S. Wajed Ali retired from the position of third presidency magistrate and restarted his independent legal profession. At this time he still resided at his residence at 48, Jhowtolla Road. S. Wajed Ali was a soft-spoken person with a reserved and contemplative nature. He was a unique and distinctive personality of his time with his aristocratic bearing, wide grasp of knowledge and intellectual pursuits. Regarding his personality Syed Ali Ahsan has justifiably commented: \\"S. Wajed Ali possessed an exceptionally generous nature. With such a magnanimous, righteous, broad-minded and pleasing personality, he was well loved by all he came into contact with...' 'He had an extraordinary depth of perception'. While never loud nor offensive, he was amusing and extremely well informed in his discussions. He loved talking to children and often listened to their stories, keeping them amused with his special simple magical simplicity and charm. He had some unique pursuits: he loved to walk the streets and parks in Calcutta so much so that he is quoted as having said that ' I am ready to deny myself many things in my life, but I am not ready to give up my pleasure of walking..... I usually like to walk in the Maidan.'. Towards the middle of 1949, S. Wajed Ali was affected with 'cerebral thrombosis', which rendered one side of his body paralysed. He was treated by the German doctor Mr. Troy and cared for by nurses. In these difficult days, his sons looked after him regularly. His younger brother Mr. S. Shamsher Ali visited him every day. His first wife Ayesha Khatun often visited him. Finally, at 9 o' clock of Sunday, 10 June 1951, he died at his 48, Jhowtolla residence. He was buried beside the grave of his last wife Mrs. Badrunnessa Ali at Gobra graveyard in Calcutta, where he had bought the place for himself when she died in 1931, 20 years earlier. Bounded by marble railings, his tombstone bears dates of his birth and death. He is honoured every year in a festival at his birthplace of Baratajpur.

History The area of Dungarpur district was occupied by the Bhil people perhaps as early as 4000 BCE. But this time it is developed enough like other smart city. There is second largest community of Patidar. It was invaded by Rajputs in the 12th century. Dungarpur State was founded in 1197 by Samant Singh, a Rajput prince from Mewar, but Rajput control over the area took centuries. Bagar or Vargar was the name the Rajputs gave to the area of Dungarpur and Banswara districts. The Bhil people remained the major ethnic group in the district during Rajput rule, and under the British Raj formed the core of the military and police. Geography and climate Dungarpur District lies in southern Rajasthan on the border with Gujarat. The district has an area of 3,770 km2 and had a population of 1,388,906 in 2011. The district is roughly triangular in shape. The Mahi River runs along the southeastern edge of the district, forming the boundary with Banswara District. The Som River, a tributary of the Mahi, runs along the northern edge of the district, largely forming the boundary with Udaipur District. The district is bounded on the southeast by the districts of Sabarkantha, Panchmahal and Dahod of the state of Gujarat. The Vatrak River originates in Dungarpur District. The district has a dry climate with a hot season from April to June; however the climate is milder than in the desert regions of Rajasthan to the north and west. The maximum temperature in the district occurs during the hot season and ranges between 40¬∞to 45¬∞ Celsius. The minimum temperature ranges between 10¬∞ and 12¬∞ Celsius, usually occurring in January. The monsoon season, which runs from June through September, brings almost the only rain to much of the district, but some rain may fall from November through February. The annual rainfall varies extensively over the district from up to 880 mm in Dungarpur town in the northwest to under 500 mm at Nithawa in the northeast. But the rainfall is quite variable from year to year, as Nithawa had 805 mm in 2013 but only 465 mm in 2014. Economy In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Dungarpur one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the twelve districts in Rajasthan currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF). Demographics According to the 2011 census Dungarpur district has a population of 1,388,552, roughly equal to the nation of Swaziland or the US state of Hawaii. This gave it a ranking of 351st in India (out of a total of 640). The district had a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 25.39%. Dungarpur had a sex ratio of 990 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 60.78%. At the time of the 2011 Census of India, 74.60% of the population in the district spoke Bhili, 21.47% Punjabi and 3.42% Hindi as their first language.2011 Census of India, Population By Mother Tongue The Vagad region of Rajasthan includes Dungarpur and Banswara districts. Vagad's population is predominantly Bhils, a tribal people of central India. Administrative divisions, villages and towns At the 2001 Indian census the Dungarpur district was divided into four tehsils: Aspur, Dungarpur, Sagwara and Simalwara; however, around 2007 the new tehsil of Bichiwara (Bichhiwara) was created out of the western part of Dungarpur Tehsil. There are four towns in Dungarpur district: two municipalities Dungarpur and Sagwara, and two census towns Seemalwara and Galiakot. As of the 2011 census there were 976 villages in the district.

While Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Union armies marched north across South Carolina, about 1,200 Confederates under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws were posted at the crossing on the Salkehatchie River. Union soldiers began to build bridges to bypass McLaws on February 2. The next day two brigades under Maj. Gen. Francis P. Blair waded through the swamp and flanked the Confederates. McLaws withdrew toward Branchville after stalling Sherman's advance for only one day and Sherman's forces continued moving north towards the state capital Columbia. Mass grave In 1876 men from nearby communities reburied the Confederate dead from Rivers Bridge in a mass grave about a mile from the battlefield and began a tradition of annually commemorating the battle. The Rivers Bridge Memorial Association eventually obtained the battlefield and in 1945 turned the site over to South Carolina for a state park. The site is commemorated by the Rivers Bridge State Historic Site. Battlefield condition Earthworks used by the Confederate defenders are preserved at the historic site. Unfortunately, a portion of the bluff overlooking the river (upon which several Confederate earthworks were located) was significantly altered by the operations of a logging railroad that paralleled the Salkehatchie River during the late 19th century.

It was also called Queen Adelaide's Province. The British Kaffraria was established in 1847 when the British colonisers occupying South Africa invaded the Ciskei region between the Keiskamma and Great Kei rivers and declared it a Crown Colony. Just 17 years later, it was incorporated into the Cape Colony after the Xhosa people suffered from a great famine following the Xhosa cattle-killing movement of 1856-7 and required relief from the colonisers‚Äô government.2013\\\\. Literature on the History of Southern Africa: British Kaffraria. World History at KMLA. Accessed 6 April 2018. The term Kaffraria stems from the word \\"Kaffir\\" which was used as a term for the Black African inhabitants of southern Africa. The word is derived from the Arabic kafir that is usually translated into English as \\"disbeliever\\" or \\"non-believer\\", i.e. a non-Muslim or \\"one without religion\\". The word was originally applied to non Muslims in general, and therefore to non-Muslim black peoples encountered along the Swahili coast by Arab traders. The word \\"Kaffraria\\" came to refer specifically to the Xhosa lands in what is now the Eastern Cape. Later, the western Xhosa lands which fell under British rule came to be known as British Kaffraria, while the still independent Xhosa territory to the east in the Transkei region was known simply as Kaffraria proper and would be incorporated into the Cape Colony later. It was inhabited primarily by the Ngqika (\\"Gaika\\") people, the major branch of the Rharhabe Xhosa. A subsection of British Kaffraria was later reconstituted by the apartheid regime as the semi-independent homeland of Ciskei. Colonial rule Similar to elsewhere in Southern Africa, the aboriginal inhabitants of the area were the Khoisan hunter gatherers and herders. Early on, these peoples were displaced by the Bantu expansion, when it crossed the Kei river from the north. The area was consolidated under the rule of a branch of the Xhosa people. Xhosa rule The native Xhosa were ruled by the Ngqika (\\"Gaika\\") chiefs (part of the Rarabe offshoot of the main Xhosa line): *Ngqika ka Rarabe (the founding Chief), 1797 ‚Äì 13 November 1829 *Mgolombane Sandile, 13 November 1829 ‚Äì 1 June 1878 British rule Sir Harry Smith The territory came under British rule in the 19th century. However, there was great disagreement on how it should be governed, with the Cape Colony being reluctant to take responsibility for its administration. Its status therefore changed several times before it finally became part of the Cape Colony. The territory‚Äôs administration was handled by a British military officer who was appointed as the chief commissioner. Each administrative chief was assisted by assistant commissioners who acted as magistrates, advisors and arbitrators among the several Xhosa tribes.Church, J. 2005. The Place of Indigenous Law in a Mixed Legal System and a Society in Transformation: A South African Experience. Pp 94 ‚Äì 106. African Human Rights Law Journal (AHRLJ). Accessed 6 April 2018. The authority of the Xhosa chiefs was recognised to a limited degree since their decisions were subject to review by the colonial administration. Any decisions made by the Xhosa chiefs could also be reversed if they were contrary to the British colonisers‚Äô agenda. The Xhosa Chiefs had to acknowledge the Queen of England and recognise their own subordination to the appointed British military commander. British commander Harry Smith initially arrived in the Cape Of Good Hope in 1828 to lead the British army. He led a British force in the Sixth Xhosa War of 1834-36. He returned from India in 1847 to become the governor of the Cape Colony.British Kaffraria. Historical Dictionary of the British Empire. Accessed 6 April 2018. He attempted to unseat Chief Sandile of the Ngqika people (he was also the paramount chief of all Rharhabe tribes) in British Kaffraria when the Mlanjeni War (also known as the 8th Xhosa War) erupted in 1850. The war lasted until 1853 even after Smith was recalled. =\\"Queen Adelaide Province\\" in the Cape Colony (1835)= After the 6th Frontier War (\\"Hintsa's War\\"), on 10 May 1835, the area was seized by the British Governor Sir Benjamin d'Urban, and annexed to the Cape Colony as Queen Adelaide Province. It was established when the Xhosa people were driven across the Kei River and a new buffer zone was established with white settlers maintaining the new order. The province was divided into small chiefdoms that were controlled by magistrates who lived in the various chiefs‚Äô Great Places.A brief history of South Africa: Queen Adelaide Province & British Kaffraria World History. Accessed 6 April 2018. A location for the new province's government was selected, and named King William's Town. The province was declared to be for the settlement of loyal African tribes, those rebel tribes who agreed to replace their leadership, and the Fengu (known to the Europeans as the \\"Fingo people\\"), who had recently arrived fleeing from the Zulu armies and had been living under Xhosa subjection. Magistrates were appointed to administer the territory in the hope that they would gradually, with the help of missionaries, undermine tribal authority. The area was named after Queen Adelaide, the wife of King William IV. When the brutality of the annexation was reported to the colonial office in England, authorities were expressed their disapproval of D‚ÄôUrban‚Äôs processes. The British government, along with the rest of Europe, was in the wake of the Romantic Age in 1835 and prescribed to a philanthropic approach. Lord Glenelg, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, stressed that the horrors of the war created by the British invaders in South Africa brought dishonour to the British name and \\"Queen Adelaide Province‚Äù would no longer be the name of the territory. =A separate \\"Queen Adelaide Land district\\" (1836‚Äì1847)= Only a few months after its forcible joining to the Cape Colony, on 5 December 1835, the Cape Colony disallowed the annexation. The province's creation was also condemned by London, as being uneconomical and unjust. Queen Adelaide was formally disannexed in December 1836, the Cape's border was re-established back at the Keiskamma river, and new treaties were made with the chiefs responsible for order beyond the Fish River. The area was now renamed Queen Adelaide Land district, with Grahamstown as its capital. Indigenous rule by and large re- established itself in much of the territory and the land remained a separate entity until 1847. =\\"British Kaffraria\\" in the Cape Colony (1847‚Äì1866)= After the 7th Frontier War (\\"Amatola War\\"), on 17 December 1847, the area was again seized by the new British Governor Harry Smith, and again annexed to the Cape Colony, this time as the British Kaffraria Colony, with King William's Town as its capital. The new Governor re-occupied the abandoned forts and British Imperial troops were moved into the territory. German emigrants arrived in British Kaffraria in 1858‚Äì1859, and again in 1877‚Äì1878. =A separate \\"British Kaffraria\\" Crown Colony (1860‚Äì1866)= On 7 March 1860, in the wake of the great Xhosa cattle-killing, the Cape Colony again dis-annexed British Kaffraria, and it became a separate crown colony. A separate Lieutenant Governor, Colonel John Maclean, was appointed to administer the colony. However economic problems threatened to bankrupt the colony and pressure was brought upon the neighbouring Cape Colony once again to take on the territory and its expenses. =Final Annexation to the Cape Colony (1866)= It was finally re-incorporated into the Cape Colony on 17 April 1866. From 1853 to 1866 the territory used the stamps of the Cape of Good Hope, the mail being sent from Port Elizabeth or overland from the Cape. The area eventually formed the basis of the Ciskei independent homeland.

As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the ship was built in Britain. She participated in most of the naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05. The ship was moderately damaged during the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle off Ulsan, and the Battle of Tsushima. Iwate played a minor role in World War I and began the first of her many training cruises for naval cadets in 1916, a task that would last until the end of 1939. The ship continued to conduct training in home waters throughout the Pacific War. Iwate was sunk by American carrier aircraft during the attack on Kure in July 1945. Her wreck was refloated and scrapped in 1946‚Äì47. Background and description The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan was made after the First Sino-Japanese War and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships, all of which had to be ordered from British shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships. The revised plan is commonly known as the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\".Evans & Peattie, pp. 57‚Äì62 Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes, Iwate and her half-sisters were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline.Milanovich, p. 72 The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars.

The main armament for all of the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\" armored cruisers was four eight-inch guns in twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The secondary armament consisted of 14 Elswick Ordnance Company \\"Pattern Z\\" quick-firing (QF), guns. Only four of these guns were not mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields. Iwate was also equipped with a dozen QF 12-pounder 12-cwt guns\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. and eight QF 2.5-pounder Yamauchi guns as close-range defense against torpedo boats. The ship was equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.Milanovich, p. 78 All of the \\"Six-Six Fleet\\" armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences. The waterline belt of Krupp cemented armor ran the full length of the ship and its thickness varied from amidships to at the bow and stern. It had a height of , of which was normally underwater. The upper strake of belt armor was thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck. It extended from the forward to the rear barbette. The Izumo class had oblique 127 mm armored bulkheads that closed off the ends of the central armored citadel.Milanovich, pp. 80‚Äì81 The barbettes, gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 6 inches thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by of armor. The deck was thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was in thickness.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 225 Construction and career Iwate prior to launching, Newcastle upon Tyne Iwate at anchor, Plymouth, c. 1901 The contract for Iwate, named after the eponymous prefecture,Silverstone, p. 331 was signed on 19 July 1898 with Armstrong Whitworth.

She was completed on 18 March 1901 and departed for Japan the following dayMilanovich, p. 73 under the command of Captain Yamada Hikohachi, who had been appointed to supervise her construction and bring her back to Japan. Iwate arrived in Yokosuka on 17 May and Yamada was relieved by Captain Taketomi Kunikane on 6 July.Hackett & Kingsepp Russo-Japanese War At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Iwate was the flagship of Rear Admiral Misu Sotar≈ç, commander of the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet.Kowner, p. 241 She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. T≈çg≈ç had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. T≈çg≈ç chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect.Forczyk, pp. 42‚Äì43 Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before T≈çg≈ç disengaged.Corbett 1994, I, p. 105 Iwate had, in fact, been considerably damaged in the engagement.Warner & Warner, p. 201 In early March, Kamimura was tasked to take the reinforced 2nd Division north and make a diversion off Vladivostok. While scouting for Russian ships in the area, the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect. Upon their return to Japan a few days later, the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the Imperial Guards Division to Korea and then to join the ships blockading Port Arthur. Kamimura was ordered north in mid-April to cover the Sea of Japan and defend the Korea Strait against any attempt by the Vladivostok Independent Cruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen, to break through and unite with the Pacific Squadron. The two units narrowly missed each other on the 24th in heavy fog and the Japanese proceeded to Vladivostok where they laid several minefields before arriving back at Wonsan on the 30th.Corbett 1994, I, pp. 138‚Äì39, 142‚Äì45, 160, 177, 188‚Äì89, 191‚Äì96 The division failed to intercept the Russian squadron as it attacked several transports south of Okinoshima Island on 15 June due to heavy rain and fog. The Russians sortied again on 30 June and Kamimura finally was able to intercept them the next day near Okinoshima. The light was failing when they were spotted and the Russians were able to disengage in the darkness. Jessen's ships sortied again on 17 July headed for the eastern coast of Japan to act as a diversion and pull Japanese forces out of the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. The Russian ships passed through Tsugaru Strait two days later and began capturing ships bound for Japan. The arrival of the Russians off Tokyo Bay on the 24th caused the Naval General Staff to order Kamimura to sail for Cape Toi Misaki, Ky≈´sh≈´, fearing that Jessen would circumnavigate Japan to reach Port Arthur. Two days later he was ordered north to the Kii Channel and then to Tokyo Bay on the 28th. The General Staff finally ordered him back to Tsushima Island on the 30th; later that day he received word that Jessen's ships had passed through the Tsugaru Strait early that morning and reached Vladivostok on 1 August.Corbett 1994, I, pp. 283‚Äì89, 319‚Äì25, 337‚Äì51 =Battle off Ulsan= Iwate at anchor, 1902 On 10 August, the ships at Port Arthur attempted a breakout to Vladivostok, but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them, but the order was delayed. His three armored cruisers, , , and , had to raise steam, so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August. By dawn he had reached Tsushima, but turned back when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron. north of the island he encountered Kamimura's squadron, which consisted of four modern armored cruisers, , , , and Iwate. The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting one another and each had reversed course around first light. This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok.Brook 2000, pp. 34, 37 Jessen ordered his ships to turn to the northeast when he spotted the Japanese at 05:00 and they followed suit, albeit on a slightly converging course. Both sides opened fire around 05:23 at a range of . The Japanese ships concentrated their fire on Rurik, the rear ship of the Russian formation. She was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern of the other two ships. Jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open the range, but this blinded the Russian gunners with the rising sun and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on the Japanese. About 06:00, Jessen turned 180¬∞ to starboard in an attempt to reach the Korean coast and to allow Rurik to rejoin the squadron. Kamimura followed suit around 06:10, but turned to port, which opened the range between the squadrons. Azuma then developed engine problems and the Japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed. Firing recommenced at 06:24 and Rurik was hit three times in the stern, flooding her steering compartment; she had to be steered with her engines. Her speed continued to decrease, further exposing her to Japanese fire, and her steering jammed to port around 06:40.Brook 2000, pp. 39, 43 Jessen made another 180¬∞ turn in an attempt to interpose his two ships between the Japanese and Rurik, but the latter ship suddenly turn to starboard and increased speed and passed between Jessen's ships and the Japanese. Kamimura turned 180¬∞ as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses, but Jessen quickly made another 180¬∞ turn so that they headed on opposing courses. At this time an eight-inch shell struck the roof of Iwates starboard forward upper six-inch casemate and ignited the ready-use ammunition. The fire killed 40 and wounded 24 more and knocked out the six-inch gun in that casemate, as well as those below and aft of it. In addition, the 12-pounder above it was rendered inoperable. The Russians reversed course for the third time around 07:45 in another attempt to support Rurik although Rossia was on fire herself; her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later. Kamimura circled Rurik to the south at 08:00 and allowed the other two Russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to Vladivostok. Despite this, Jessen turned back once more at 08:15 and ordered Rurik to make her own way back to Vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed, about .Brook 2000, p. 43 About this time Kamimura's two elderly protected cruisers, and , were approaching from the south. Their arrival allowed Kamimura to pursue Jessen with all of his armored cruisers while the two new arrivals dealt with Rurik. They fought a running battle with the Russians for the next hour and a half; scoring enough hits on them to force their speed down to . The Japanese closed to a minimum of about , but Kamimura then opened the range up to . About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously informed him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He did not wish to leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. Iwate was the most seriously damaged Japanese ship and suffered a total of 40 killed and 37 wounded.Brook 2000, pp. 43, 45 In mid-September, Tokiwa and Iwate were transferred to the 1st Division. In early December the cruiser was sent home to refit. In mid- February, she was guarding the Tsugaru Strait and remained there through mid- April.Corbett 1994, II, pp. 52, 104, 162, 176 =Battle of Tsushima= A Japanese postcard of Iwate at sea, c. 1905 As the Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons approached Japan on 27 May, having sailed from the Baltic Sea, they were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning, but visibility was limited and radio reception poor. The preliminary reports were enough to cause T≈çg≈ç to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships under the command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky at around 11:30. Kamimura closed to about a range of before sheering off under fire to join T≈çg≈ç's battleships.Corbett 1994, II, pp. 232, 235 Iwate, now the flagship of Rear Admiral Shimamura Hayao,Kowner, p. 352 was last in the 2nd Division when T≈çg≈ç opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14:10 and, like most of the ships in the division, engaged the battleship which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later. The cruiser also fired upon the battleship before 14:50. The protected cruiser attempted to make a torpedo attack at about 15:06, but was driven off by fire from Iwate and the armored cruisers and . The battleship suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15:35 at a range of about . All of Kamimura's ships engaged her for five minutes or so with Azuma and the armored cruiser also firing torpedoes at the Russian ship without effect.Campbell, Part 2, pp. 128‚Äì32 After 17:30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers, leaving T≈çg≈ç's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin T≈çg≈ç. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8000‚Äì9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined T≈çg≈ç at 20:08 as night was falling.Campbell, Part 3, pp. 186‚Äì87 The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range.Corbett 1994, II, pp. 319‚Äì20 In the meantime, the coast defense ship had fallen well behind Nebogatov's ships and was spotted by the protected cruiser early in the morning, but the Japanese were more intent on locating the main body of the Russian fleet than attacking a single isolated ship. Admiral Ushakov was then spotted at 14:10, well after Nebogatov's surrender, by Shimamura who received permission to pursue her with Iwate and Yakumo. They caught up with the Russian ship at 17:00 and demanded her surrender. Admiral Ushakov attempted to close the range to bring the Japanese cruisers within range of her guns, but they were fast enough to keep the range open and the Russian ship never hit either one. After about half an hour, Admiral Ushakov was listing heavily enough that her guns could not elevate enough to bear and her commander ordered his crew to abandon ship and the scuttling charges detonated. The ship sank in three minutes and 12 officers and 327 crewmen were rescued by the Japanese. Between them, Yakumo and Iwate fired 89 eight- and 278 six-inch shells during the engagement.McLaughlin, pp. 64‚Äì65 Iwate was struck 17 times, over the course of the entire battle, including hits that burst in the water alongside. She was, however, only lightly damaged by two hits that caused two compartments on the lower deck to flood. These hits were made by two 12-inch, three 8-inch, two 6-inch, one 120 mm (4.7 in), five 75 mm (3 in), and four unidentified shells.Campbell, Part 4, pp. 263, 265 As the IJN was preparing to invade Sakhalin Island in early July, Kamimura's 2nd Division, now reduced to Iwate, Izumo, and Tokiwa, was tasked to defend the Korea Strait before it escorted troops that made an amphibious landing in northeastern Korea. In mid-August, the division covered the landing at Chongjin, closer to the Russian border.Corbett 1994, II, pp. 356, 363‚Äì65, 377‚Äì80 After the war, she was briefly commanded by Captain Yamashita Gentaro from 2 February to 22 November 1906 before he was relieved by Captain Arima Ryokitsu. Subsequent service The ship participated in the early stages of the Battle of Tsingtao before returning to Sasebo on 2 October 1914.Burdick, pp. 228, 241 The following month she was assigned to the First South Seas Squadron, based at Fiji and later at the Marquesas Islands.Corbett 1938, I, pp. 366, 409 On 1 September 1915, Iwate was assigned to the Training Squadron where she conducted long-distance oceanic navigation and officer training for cadets in the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy. She began the first of her 16 training cruises on 20 April 1916, together with Azuma, and visited Australia and Southeast Asia before returning home on 22 August. The ship was relieved of her assignment the next month, but rejoined the Training Squadron a year later in preparation for her next training cruise. Iwate departed on 2 March 1918, bound for Central America, Hawaii and the South Sea Islands, and returned on 6 July.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 657‚Äì58 Iwate at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, 1933 Two years later, the ship began her next training cruise on 21 August 1920, visiting South America and the South Sea Islands, before returning on 4 April 1921.Lacroix & Wells, p. 657 On 1 September, she was re-designated as a 1st-class coast-defense ship.Hackett & Kingsepp On 26 June 1922, Iwate, accompanied by Izumo and Yakumo, began a circumnavigation of the world that took them to Hawaii, Los Angeles, California, through the Panama Canal to Rio de Janeiro, where the cadets viewed the Independence Centenary International Exposition commemorating Brazilian independence. The ships then visited Buenos Aires, Argentina and Durban, South Africa before heading home via the Indian Ocean, where they arrived on 8 February 1923. In 1924, four of Iwates 12-pounder guns were removed, as were all of her QF 2.5-pounder guns, and a single 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added. Refitted again in 1931, her torpedo tubes were removed as were all of her main deck 6-inch guns and their casemates plated over; she now carried only two 12-pounders, although she now had three 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type AA guns.Chesneau, p. 174 In addition her boilers were replaced by six Yarrow boilers with an output of only which reduced her top speed to . She now carried of coal and of fuel oil. Her crew now numbered 726 officers and enlisted men. The ship continued to make training cruises, usually at two-year intervals, for the rest of the decade that took her to the East Coast of North America and the Mediterranean Sea among other places. One of her cadets on the 1925‚Äì26 cruise was Prince Hironobu Fushimi. In December 1928, the ship escorted Emperor Hirohito during an Imperial fleet review in Yokohama harbor. From 1932 the training voyages became annual events, with the exception of 1935, until they ceased at the end of 1939. Iwate was assigned to the 12th Squadron of the 3rd Support Fleet from 1 February 1940. Despite her antiquated age, she was briefly re-classified as a 1st-class cruiser on 1 July 1942 before she was reclassified as a training ship in 1943.Fukui, p. 4 On 19 March 1945, Iwate was attacked by American carrier aircraft, killing one crewman, although they failed to inflict any significant damage. Shortly afterwards, her 8-inch guns were replaced by four Type 89 dual-purpose guns in two twin mounts and four of her remaining 6-inch guns were removed. Her light anti-aircraft armament was significantly reinforced by the addition of nine license-built Hotchkiss 25-millimeter Type 96 light AA guns in one triple, two twin, and two single-gun mounts and two 13.2-millimeter Hotchkiss machine guns in single mounts. The ship was bombed during the American aerial attack on Kure on 24 July 1945. While not hit by any bombs, the three near misses sprang the ship's seams and the resulting flooding caused her to sink in shallow water at coordinates the following day. She was removed from the navy list on 30 November and her hulk was raised and scrapped in 1946‚Äì47 by the Harima Dock Company.

Cleopatra is sometimes known as Cleopatra the Elder, to distinguish her from her sister of the same name and was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus. She was the wife of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great. She married Tigranes in 94 BC, cementing the alliance between Pontus and Armenia. She played a decisive role in the life of Tigranes and all of Armenia. Cleopatra bore Tigranes three sons: Zariadres, Artavasdes II of Armenia and Tigranes, and two daughters. One daughter married King Pacorus I of Parthia and the other married King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene. Tigranes chose a foreign policy different from that of Mithridates towards the Roman Republic based on his interests, and he eventually signed a treaty with Rome following the Battle of Artaxata in 68 BC, as a result of which Cleopatra, under the influence of her father, instigated their sons to betray Tigranes. In 66 BC, Pompey captured the younger Tigranes and took him to Rome as a hostage. Tigranes later escaped in 58 BC with the assistance of Publius Clodius Pulcher. Roman historian Asconius described the event. The sons attempted unsuccessfully to seize the throne from Tigranes; Zariadres and his younger brother were executed by Tigranes.

The term \\"off limits\\" referred to the area where the original crime took place, an area of Saigon off limits to military personnel. The name of the film was changed to Saigon or Saigon: Off Limits when it was released throughout the rest of the world. The film marks Willem Dafoe's second Vietnam War film. He was assisted in preparing for this role by Vietnam Veteran and former Counterintelligence Special Agent Ed Murphy. Dafoe had previously starred in Platoon and would go on to play roles in Born on the Fourth of July and Flight of the Intruder. Although set during the war, the tale is more of a mystery than a story about the war. Plot Sergeant First Class Buck McGriff (Willem Dafoe) and Sergeant First Class Albaby Perkins (Gregory Hines) are two joint services Criminal Investigation Division (CID) agents on duty in war torn Saigon. When a prostitute is found murdered they discover that the prime suspects are high ranking U.S. Army officers. As they investigate they find that there have been a string of at least six murders in the last year, but the previous inquiry was shut down from higher up the chain of command. Investigations lead them to Colonel Dexter Armstrong (Scott Glenn), but Armstrong rules himself out of inquiries by committing suicide. With the help of a French nun Sister Nicole (Amanda Pays) and their non-commissioned officer in charge, Master Sergeant Dix (Fred Ward), they finally close in on their target. As their investigation leads them closer and closer to the murderer, they find their lives are in danger and they end up nearly being sent home. The movie ends with an unexpected twist when they rule out all their suspects by conducting an interview in a Viet Cong tunnel base, and their NCO is the killer.

Agentura.ru.  History = Zealotry in the 1st century  According to Mark Burgess (a Center for Defense Information research analyst), the 1st century Jewish political and religious movement called Zealotry was one of the first examples of the use of terrorism by Jews. They sought to incite the people of Judaea Province to rebel against the Roman Empire and expel it from Israel by force of arms. The term Zealot, in Hebrew kanai, means one who is zealous on behalf of God.Zealot, Online Etymology DictionaryZelotes, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, \\"A Greek-English Lexicon\\", at Perseus The most extremist groups of Zealots were called Sicarii. Sicarii used violent stealth tactics against Romans. Under their cloaks they concealed sicae, or small daggers, from which they received their name. At popular assemblies, particularly during the pilgrimage to the Temple Mount, they stabbed their enemies (Romans or Roman sympathizers, Herodians), lamenting ostentatiously after the deed to blend into the crowd to escape detection. In one account, given in the Talmud, Sicarii destroyed the city's food supply so that the people would be forced to fight against the Roman siege instead of negotiating peace. Sicarii also raided Jewish habitations and killed fellow Jews whom they considered apostates and collaborators.  Since 1948  Jewish terrorism in Israel existed for a few years during the 1950s and was directed at internal Israeli- Jewish targets, not at the Israeli Arab population.Gal-or, Noemi (Editor). Tolerating Terrorism in the West: An International Survey. Routledge, 2004. . pp. 61‚Äì62 There was then a long intermission until the 1980s, when the Jewish Underground was exposed. The phenomena of price tag attacks began around 2008. These are hate crimes committed by extremist settler Jewish Israelis that usually involve the destruction of property or hateful graffiti, particularly targeting property associated with Arabs, Christians, secular Israelis, and Israeli soldiers. The name was derived from the words \\"Price tag\\" which may be scrawled on the site of the attack ‚Äî with the allegation that the attack was a \\"price\\" for settlements the government forced them to give up and revenge for Palestinian attacks on settlers. Researchers Ami Pedahzur and Arie Perliger suggested that similarities exist between Jewish religious terrorists and jihad networks in Western democracies, among them: alienation and isolation from the values of the majority, mainstream culture, which they view as an existential threat to their own community; and that their ideology is not exclusively \\"religious\\", as it attempts to achieve political, territorial, and nationalistic goals as well (e.g. the disruption of the Camp David accords). However, the newer of these Jewish groups have tended to emphasize religious motives for their actions at the expense of secular ones. In the case of Jewish terrorism in modern Israel, most networks consist of religious Zionists and ultra-Orthodox Jews living in isolated, homogenous communities. However, unlike jihad networks, Jewish terrorists have not engaged in mass-casualty attacks (except for Baruch Goldstein). Shin Bet has complained that the Israeli government is too lenient in dealing with religious extremism of Jewish extremists who want the creation of a Jewish land based on halacha, Jewish religious laws. Says Haaretz: \\"The Shin Bet complained that the courts are too lenient, particularly in enforcement against those who violate restraining orders distancing them from the West Bank or restricting their movement. The Shin Bet supports the position of Defense Minister Moshe Ya‚Äôalon, who has called for limited use of administrative detention against Jewish terrorists.\\"Settler Terror Underground Seeks to Overthrow Israeli Government, Say Investigators Haaretz, 3 August 2015 Israeli agencies keeping tabs on the religious terrorist groups say they are \\"anarchist\\" and \\"anti- Zionist\\", motivated to bring down the government of Israel and create a new Israeli \\"kingdom\\" that would operate according to halacha (Jewish law). A week after the July 2015 attacks, administrative detention was approved for Jewish terror suspects. Terrorist groups The following groups have been considered religious terrorist organizations in Israel: * Brit HaKanaim (Hebrew: ◊ë÷∞÷º◊®÷¥◊ô◊™ ◊î÷∑◊ß÷∑◊†÷∑◊ê÷¥◊ô◊ù, lit. Covenant of the Zealots) was a radical religious Jewish underground organization which operated in Israel between 1950 and 1953, against the widespread trend of secularisation in the country. The ultimate goal of the movement was to impose Jewish religious law in the State of Israel and establish a Halakhic state.Pedahzur, Ami, and Arie Perliger (2009). ‚ÄúJewish Terrorism in Israel.pg 33-37‚Äù, Columbia University Press, (2009) * The Kingdom of Israel group (Hebrew: ◊û◊ú◊õ◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, Malchut Yisrael), or Tzrifin Underground, were active in Israel in the 1950s. The group carried out attacks on the diplomatic facilities of the USSR and Czechoslovakia and occasionally shot at Jordanian troops stationed along the border in Jerusalem. Members of the group were caught trying to bomb the Israeli Ministry of Education in May 1953, have been described as acting because of the secularisation of Jewish North African immigrants which they saw as 'a direct assault on the religious Jews' way of life and as an existential threat to the ultra-Orthodox community in Israel.'Pedahzur, Ami, and Arie Perliger (2009). ‚ÄúJewish Terrorism in Israel.pg 31-33‚Äù, Columbia University Press, (2009) * Gush Emunim Underground (1979‚Äì1984): formed by members of the Israeli political movement Gush Emunim.For The Land and The Lord: The Evolution of Gush Emunim , by Ian S. Lustick This group is most well known for two actions: firstly, for bomb attacks on the mayors of West Bank cities on June 2, 1980, and secondly, an abandoned plot to blow up the Temple Mount mosques. The Israeli Judge Zvi Cohen, heading the sentencing panel at the group's trial, stated that they had three motives, \\"not necessarily shared by all the defendants.

The anti-Zionist group is thought to have roughly 100 activist members. The Sikrikim gained international attention for acts of violence they committed against Orthodox Jewish institutions and individuals who would not comply with their demands. They are loosely affiliated with Neturei Karta.Amoni, P. An Interview with Rav Shlomo Pappenheim. Ami Magazine, September 2011 * Kach and Kahane Chai, a banned far-right party in Israel. Today, both groups are considered terrorist organisations by Israel, Canada,Canada Public Safety website the European Union and the United States. The groups are believed to have an overlapping core membership of fewer than 100 people. The Jewish Defense League in America, founded by Kahane, is also considered terrorist. FBI statistics show that, from 1980 to 1985, 15 terrorist attacks were attempted in the U.S. by JDL members. The FBI's Mary Doran described the JDL in 2004 Congressional testimony as \\"a proscribed terrorist group\\".Federal Bureau of Investigation - Congressional Testimony The National Consortium for the Study of Terror and Responses to Terrorism states that, during the JDL's first two decades of activity, it was an \\"active terrorist organization.\\"JDL group profile from National Consortium for the Study of Terror and Responses to Terrorism * Terror Against Terror (Hebrew: Terror Neged Terror, \\"TNT\\") was a radical Jewish militant organization that sponsored several attacks against Palestinian targets. The group was founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane's Kach organization, and took its name from Kahane's theory that Arab terrorism should be met with Jewish terrorism.Brother against brother: violence and extremism in Israeli politics from Altalena to the Rabin assassination by Ehud Sprinzak *The Revolt terror group: Members of the Jewish \\"Revolt\\" terror group claim the secular State of Israel has no right to existence; they hope to create a Jewish Kingdom in Israel, and that Arabs will be killed if they refuse to leave. Shin Bet says the \\"Revolt\\" group's ideology began to evolve in October 2013, shaped by veteran \\"hilltop youth\\", including Rabbi Meir Kahane's grandson, Meir Ettinger, who was temporarily put under administrative detention. Before the Duma attack, the group's members had committed 11 arson attacks against Palestinians or Christian churches. 23 of their members were detained because of the Duma attacks.A revolt and a king: The ideology behind Jewish terrorism YNET News, Jan 3, 2016 Individuals Several violent acts by Jews have been described as terrorism and attributed to religious motivations. The following are the most notable: * Yigal Amir's assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on November 4, 1995, has been described as terrorism with a religious motivation.* Mahan, Sue; Griset, Pamala, Terrorism in Perspective, SAGE, 2007, pp. 137, 138 * Mickolus, Edward, The terrorist list: A-K, ABC-CLIO, 2009, p. 66 * Hoffman, Bruce Inside Terrorism 1998, p. 88 Amir was quoted as saying he had \\"acted alone and on orders from God\\", and that, \\"If not for a Halakhic ruling of din rodef, made against Rabin by a few rabbis I knew about, it would have been very difficult for me to kill.\\" A former combat soldier who had studied Jewish law, Amir stated that his decision to kill the prime minister was influenced by the opinions of militant rabbis that such an assassination would be justified by the Halakhic ruling of din rodef (\\"pursuer's decree\\"). This Jewish religious concept allows for an immediate execution of a person if that person is \\"pursuing\\", that is, attempting immediately to take your life or the life of another person, although the characterization of Rabin as din rodef was rejected as a perversion of law by most rabbinic authorities. According to Amir, allowing the Palestinian Authority to expand on the West Bank represented such a danger.Amir was associated with the radical Eyal movement, which had been greatly influenced by Kahanism. * Baruch Goldstein an American-born Israeli physician, perpetrated the 1994 Cave of the Patriarchs massacre in the city of Hebron, in which he shot and killed 29 Muslim worshipers inside the Ibrahimi Mosque (within the Cave of the Patriarchs), and wounded another 125 people.Harvey W. Kushner. Encyclopedia of Terrorism, SAGE Publications, 2003, , p. 150. Goldstein was killed by the survivors.1994: Jewish settler kills 30 at holy site BBC On This Day Goldstein was a supporter of Kach, an Israeli political party founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane that advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

His actions were condemned by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon, as \\"a reprehensible act by a bloodthirsty Jewish terrorist\\", and author Ami Pedahzur describes his motivations as religious. Washington Post, 5 August 2005 *Three marchers in a gay pride parade in Jerusalem on June 30, 2005 were stabbed by Yishai Shlisel, a Haredi Jew. Shlisel claimed he had acted \\"in the name of God\\". He was charged with attempted murder. *Yaakov Teitel an American-born Israeli, was arrested in the aftermath of the 2009 Tel Aviv gay center shooting for putting up posters that praised the attack.

Khdeir, a 16-year-old Palestinian, was forced into a car by Israeli settlers on an East Jerusalem street. Yosef Ben-David and 2 minors were arrested for the act.

Biography  Born in Nagyv√°rad, Heller took a degree in mechanical engineering in 1931 at the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule in Z√ºrich. In the 1940s the first high-pressure industrial power station was built according to his plans. It was around this time that he invented the Heller‚ÄìForg√≥ system. In 1951 he was awarded the Kossuth Prize. He organized the Department of Energetics at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, where he worked as a professor. He was a large contributor to the domain of statics, and helped establish the concept of entropy for engineering practices. In 1962 he became a full member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Heller's nephew graduated from USC, obtaining a degree in Mechanical engineering.  Heller‚ÄìForg√≥ system  The Heller‚ÄìForg√≥ system is named after Heller and L√°szl√≥ Forg√≥ (1907‚Äì1985), the active collaborator in the industrial implementation of the system. Also known as the Indirect Dry Cooling System, it solved an important problem at power stations by utilizing cooling water more efficiently. The main point of their invention was to condense the vacuum steam using an injection of cool water. The still-warm water enters into the fine-gilled heat exchanger, cools down and becomes usable again for when the cycle is repeated. The system is known and used all over the world.

Ride Gardener formed Ride with Andy Bell (guitar), whom he met at Cheney School in Oxford, and Laurence Colbert (drummer) and Steve Queralt (bass guitarist), whom he met doing Foundation Studies in Art and Design at Banbury in 1988. While still at Banbury the band produced a tape demo including the tracks \\"Chelsea Girl\\" and \\"Drive Blind\\". In February 1989 \\"Ride\\" were asked to stand in for a cancelled student union gig at Oxford Polytechnic that brought them to the attention of Alan McGee. After supporting The Soup Dragons in 1989, McGee signed them to Creation Records. With Ride, Gardener released three EPs between January and September 1990, entitled Ride, Play and Fall. While the EPs had only limited chart success, enough critical praise was received to make Ride the \\"darlings\\" of the UK music press. The first two EPs were eventually released together as Smile in the USA in July 1990 (and later released in the UK in 1992), while the Fall EP was incorporated into the CD version of their debut album, Nowhere, released in October 1990. Nowhere was hailed as a critical success and the media dubbed Ride \\"The brightest hope\\" for 1991. This was followed in March 1992 by the band's second album Going Blank Again. Despite having a solid fanbase and some mainstream success, the lack of a breakthrough contributed to inter-band tension, especially between Gardener and Bell. Their third album, Carnival of Light, was released in 1994, after shoegazing had given way to Britpop. Carnival of Light was oriented towards this new sound, but sales were sluggish and the shift in musical tastes devastated much of their original audience and critics alike. 1995 saw the dissolution of the band while recording their fourth album, Tarantula, due to creative and personal tensions between Gardener and Bell. The track listing of Carnival of Light gives some indication of the tension that was mounting between the two guitarists, with the first half of the album being songs written by Gardener and the last half of the album being songs written by Bell ‚Äì one or both had refused to let their songs be interspersed with pieces written by the other. Bell penned most of the songs for Tarantula, one of which ‚Äì \\"Castle on the Hill\\" ‚Äì was a lament for the band's situation and contains references to Gardener's self-imposed exile from the group. Gardener contributed only the song \\"Deep Inside My Pocket\\", a bitter illustration of Gardener's view of Bell at the time. The album was deleted from sales one week after release, but was re-released in 2001 along with the other Ride albums. Critics were almost universally negative regarding the album and almost seemed to view the split with relief. Ride re-formed in 2014 and are currently performing a series of tour dates in Europe and North America. The Animalhouse After leaving Ride, Gardener released the limited edition single \\"Magdalen Sky\\" on the Shifty Disco label in June 1997. This was part of the label's Single of the Month club, and was limited to 1000 copies only. It featured a rare B-side \\"Can't Let it Die (Home Demo in the Attic)\\". \\"Magdalen Sky\\" was featured on the year-end single compilation It's a Shifty Disco Thing Vol. 1. Later that same year, Supergrass producer Sam Williams played his song \\"Blah Na Na\\", which had itself also been a Shifty Disco Single of the Month, at one of Gardener's solo concerts, an event that would lead to the founding of The Animalhouse. In late 1997, Gardener and Williams joined with former Ride drummer Loz Colbert and bassist Hari T to form the Animalhouse. The band began making live appearances and received attention from the music press for its blend of 1960s psychedelica, Britrock, and electronica. Owing to a variety of legal and label related reasons, the band did not release any material until April 2000's Small EP. The album Ready To Receive followed in September, to commercial success in Japan, but limited success elsewhere. Shortly after the release of the album, the Animalhouse disbanded, with Gardener stating that \\"it just didn't work.\\" Solo and other work After the demise of The Animalhouse, Gardener moved to France and retreated from the music business. But it was not to last; while visiting his sister he began playing an acoustic guitar, re-learning old songs and writing new ones. Meanwhile, interest in Ride increased upon the release of a greatest hits record which Gardener and his former bandmates participated in selecting the songs for. This was followed by a box set, remastered re-issues of all of Ride's albums and a one- off \\"reunion\\" recorded for a Sonic Youth tribute television show. This reunion resulted in the 2002 release of a limited edition instrumental EP entitled Coming Up For Air. Gardener began playing solo shows in 2002, both in the United States and in the UK, supporting the Ride releases as well as his own newly written material. Gardener toured extensively in the two years preceding the release of his first solo studio album, including many stops in New York City. The tours ranged from shows featuring Gardener and a 12-string acoustic guitar to a full-backing band featuring members of Goldrush. An early EP was released in late 2003 as a Mark Gardener/Goldrush collaboration called Falling Out into the Night, which featured a Gardener song (\\"Snow in Mexico\\") backed by Goldrush, a Goldrush song (\\"Out of Reach\\"), and a Ride cover (\\"Dreams Burn Down\\") featuring the two together. An acoustic solo show in April 2003 at The Knitting Factory in New York City was released on CD entitled Live at the Knitting Factory, NYC. This release was a limited edition and was intended to help finance the recording of Gardener's first studio album. Finally, Gardener completed his debut solo album in 2005, titled These Beautiful Ghosts, a collaboration with fellow Oxford musicians Goldrush. In addition to Goldrush, other performers on the album include: Grasshopper and Suzanne Thorpe from Mercury Rev, Gene Park, Cat Martino, Kaye Phillips, Clive Poole, and Sacha from The Morning After Girls. A limited edition version of These Beautiful Ghosts, featuring a bonus DVD with tour footage and other materials, was made available to anyone who pre-ordered the album. Due to unforeseen issues, this DVD was delayed for over three years, finally being finished and sent out to those who had pre-ordered the album in January 2009. The album was produced and mixed by Bill Racine and Gardener. It was initially released in North America on US indie label United For Opportunity, and in 2006 was also made available in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Japan. Further European, Australian, and South-East Asia releases of the album were scheduled in late 2006. A single for the album, \\"The Story of the Eye\\", featuring a remix by Ulrich Schnauss, was released on 7-inch in November 2006 by Sonic Cathedral. The tours and collaborative EP were what led to Goldrush's extensive participation on These Beautiful Ghosts. Sometime after the release of the album, Gardener and Goldrush had a falling-out, and Goldrush no longer accompanies Gardener to shows. He has continued touring, playing solo and with different performers, most notably Cat Martino, who appeared on the album, and since late 2006, a new backing band. Gardener has also worked with a variety of artists, performing live, recording instruments and/or vocals, and producing during his post-Ride career. He has collaborated with neo- psychedelic rock band The Brian Jonestown Massacre's 13th studio album, My Bloody Underground, co-writing the song \\"Monkey Powder\\" with Anton Newcombe, and contributing to and appearing on other songs on the album. Gardener and Newcombe recorded the BJM album predominately in Iceland. Gardener has also worked with alternative rock band The Morning After Girls (from Melbourne). He contributes vocals on the song \\"Fall Before Walking\\", on the group's debut album, Shadows Evolve. Gardener has also worked with alternative rock French band Molly's (from Amiens). He produced and realised the first album of the band \\"Sighs of the Night\\" which was recorded in his own studio OX-4 Sound based in Oxford. On the album which was released on 24 January 2011, he contributes vocals on the track \\"Tastes Like Sedative\\", and joined Molly's on stage in Amiens to perform Ride's song \\"Leave Them All Behind\\". During touring for the album, Gardener has appeared on stage with both Andy Bell and Loz Colbert. Gardener currently has his own recording studio in Oxford where he produces and mixes for many bands including Swervedriver, Brian Jonestown Massacre, Robin Guthrie, Dead Horse One among others. He also provided the soundtrack for award-winning film Upside Down ‚Äì The Creation Records Story, picking up a MOJO Vision Award for his work in 2011.

Written by American author William F. Wu as novels for young adults, they were the first series authorized to use Asimov's fictional universe after his death in 1992. Plot outline Set on Earth, it tells the story of the Governors, a series of state-of-the-art administrative robots. Each Governor is physically composed of six smaller units and is responsible for single-handedly directing the operations of a human-inhabited city. When the Governor robots begin to fail mysteriously, Mojave Center (MC) Governor acts to protect his own existence by separating into his components and traveling into the remote past to escape disassembly. MC Governor is not aware, however, that the time travel method used alters its molecular structure, with the result that his components explode via nuclear blasts when they reach the moment in which they were originally altered.

Biography=Family background Prescott was born at Kew Green, Surrey, the son of Admiral Isaac Prescott and a daughter of the Reverend Richard Walter, who served as chaplain aboard the during Commodore George Anson's expedition to the Pacific, and was the author of A Voyage Round the World, in the Years 1740‚Äì44 (1748). Prescott's only brother, an infantry officer in the East India Company's service, was drowned during a voyage home in 1806. Junior officer Prescott entered the Navy on 16 February 1796 as first- class volunteer on board the 98-gun ship of the line , serving under Captains the Honourable George Cranfield Berkeley and John Irwin, stationed in the Channel. He was rated as a midshipman in April 1797, and in early 1798 followed Admiral Sir Charles Thompson (whose flag had been flying on board Formidable) into the 100-gun . In 1799 he sailed to the Mediterranean aboard the frigate , Captain the Honourable Henry Blackwood, where on 31 March 1800 he took part in the capture of the of 84 guns and 1,000 men. He afterwards took part in the Egyptian Campaign of 1801; and on 17 February 1802, while serving under Lord Keith in the 80-gun ship , was appointed acting-lieutenant of the brig , Captain James Prevost, and his commission was confirmed on 28 April 1802. He then served on the frigate , Captain Lucius Ferdinand Hardyman, in the North Sea from 26 April 1803. On 14 December 1804 he moved to the frigate , Captain Lord William FitzRoy, seeing action in the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November 1805, when a squadron under Sir Richard Strachan fought four ships escaped from Trafalgar. He subsequently served aboard Lord Eldon, Captain George B. Whinyates; the 74-gun , Captain Henry Blackwood; and the 98-gun , flagship of Lord Collingwood, all in the Mediterranean. Commander On 4 February 1808 he was promoted to commander in the 18-gun brig . On 1 April off Sardinia, he fell in with a French fleet of ten ships of the line, three frigates, a brig, and a store-ship, and after making a reconnaissance on the next day, sailed to report their position to Collingwood, who was cruising with a more powerful force near Sicily. Unfortunately, adverse winds prevented Collingwood from intercepting the French before they reached the safety of Toulon. While employed on the coast of Naples, Prescott was employed in attacking coastal traffic. He first drove a French 20-gun brig to seek refuge under shore batteries. He attempted to entice her out, and although she was supported by 11 Neapolitan gun-boats, she refused. On 8 September 1808 he contributed to the capture of four large gunboats and 34 coasting vessels assembled at Diamante near the Gulf of Policastro, which he blockaded until the arrival from Sicily of a force sufficient to capture them. On 27 October 1809 he captured the French letter of marque Veloce, of 4 guns and 83 men; and on 25 December, after a chase of nine hours and an action lasting one and a half hours, the polacre rigged privateer Eole of 14 guns and 140 men, five of whom were killed and nine wounded, with a loss of only one man killed and one wounded. Between then and June 1810, Weazel was employed off Sardinia, where she took and re-captured 17 vessels, including the French privateer schooner Ippolite, of 5 guns and 78 men. She next took part in the defence of Sicily, coming into frequent contact with the flotilla equipped by Joachim Murat for his attempted invasion of the island. On 25 July 1810 Weazel, the frigate , and the 18-gun brig-sloop , forced a convoy of 31 vessels, protected by seven large gunboats and five scampavias, to seek refuge at Amantea, under the protection of two shore batteries. Prescott led in the boats of the three British ships, and despite heavy enemy fire, captured or destroyed all the vessels. Two days later Prescott returned to Amantea with a detachment of marines from , destroyed several vessels, and captured a gun under a heavy fire of musketry, and having only three men wounded. The following month he twice engaged convoys, and captured six vessels, although he was obliged to abandon two ‚Äî an armed xebec and a gunboat ‚Äî as a sudden shift of wind direction, and the Weazles mainyard being shot away, it became impossible for her to tow them out from under a shore battery. In 1847 a clasp to the Naval General Service Medal \\"Amanthea 25 July 1810\\" was awarded to any surviving claimants from the action of that day. Post-captain and Governor He was rewarded for his actions at Amantea by receiving promotion to post-captain with seniority backdated to 25 July 1810, but did not leave Weazle until February 1811. He was appointed to command of the 20-gun sloop on 7 August 1811 off the Channel Islands. On 3 June 1813 he took command of the frigate and was employed in the Bay of Biscay until April 1815. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815. He returned to sea duty on 6 April 1821 in command of the 46-gun frigate as senior officer on the coast of Brazil and also spent 18 months in the Pacific protecting British interests during the Spanish American wars of independence. In 1822 the Congress of Peru demanded a contribution from the merchants of Lima, the British proportion amounting to nearly 200,000 dollars. Prescott not only protested, but took measures such that the Congress abandoned the idea. As a mark of their respect and gratitude, the British merchants at Lima voted the sum of 1,500 dollars to buy him a testimonial. In February 1825 he returned to England. On 24 September 1834 Prescott was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Newfoundland and its dependencies, He arrived in St John's in November, into a turbulent situation riven by political and religious acrimony. Prescott attempted to mediate between the opposing factions, but could make few decisions without angering one or the other. He attempted to resign in January 1839, but this was not accepted. Prescott finally resigned in May 1841. Despite the difficulties he made several improvements; passing an education act, which created the first non- denominational elementary schools, appointing road commissioners to improve transport, and encouraging agriculture. Prescott was not a trained administrator, but made several suggestions to improve the governance of the colony. Prescott Street in St. John's is named for Henry Prescott. Admiral Prescott was awarded the Captain's Good Service Pension on 1 April 1844, and was promoted to rear admiral on 24 April 1847, serving on the Board of Admiralty as Second Naval Lord from 20 July before being appointed Admiral-Superintendent at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard on 15 December and serving there until 1852. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 1 May 1854, made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 5 February 1856, promoted to admiral on 11 May 1860, officially retiring from the Navy on 9 June 1860. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 2 June 1869, and for a time was Justice of the Peace for Surrey. He died at his home No. 7 Leinster Gardens, Bayswater, London, on 18 November 1874, and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. Personal life On 5 July 1815 he married Mary Anne Charlotte, the eldest daughter of Vice-Admiral Philippe d'Auvergne, and had several children. His son, the Reverend Isaac Philip Prescott (d. 1898) married Caroline Mary Parke, daughter of Captain Edward Parke, RN, in 1842, and served as rector of Kelly, Devon. His daughter Henrietta (d. 1875), married Admiral Sir Stephen Lushington, and was the author of Poems, written in Newfoundland (1839) and The Sea Spirit and Other Poems (1850). His second daughter Catherine married Louis Diston Powles.s:Men-at-the-Bar/Powles, Louis Diston  See also  * List of people of Newfoundland and Labrador * References - Category:1783 births Category:1874 deaths Category:People from Kew, London Category:Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Governors of Newfoundland Colony Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Lords of the Admiralty Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery ","title":"Henry Prescott"},{"id":"3799465","text":"El Gobernador was a 4-10-0 steam locomotive built by Central Pacific Railroad at the railroad's Sacramento, California shops. It was the last of Central Pacific's locomotives to receive an official name and was also the only locomotive of this wheel arrangement to operate on United States rails. At the time it was built, El Gobernador was the largest railroad locomotive in the world. Its name is reminiscent of the railroad's first locomotive, Gov. Stanford, as El Gobernador is Spanish for The Governor. This locomotive is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a \\"Mastodon\\" type. However, this was the unofficial name for an earlier engine, No. 229, the first successful 4-8-0 ever built. Both engines looked nearly identical, except that El Gobernador was longer and had an additional pair of drivers.  Construction and operation  El Gobernador's construction was completed in February 1883, amid much fanfare from the railroad, but it didn't enter service until March 1884, just over a year later. During this time, while still in Sacramento, the gigantic engine was used as an advertising tool by the railroad, to spectacular effect. According to author Guy L. Dunscomb, the engine was kept under steam near the Central Pacific's passenger depot, where it would await the arrival of passenger trains coming in from the east. As the train arrived, El Gobernador would steam past the depot dragging a long line of empty freight cars behind it and causing quite a stir in the process. The engine would then be uncoupled and placed on adjacent trackage, where the passengers could get a good look at the monster up close. Part of the delay between construction and operation was due to the railroad's track and infrastructure of the time. It was originally designed to haul trains out of California's San Joaquin Valley via Tehachapi Loop. The locomotive was disassembled into five large subassemblies for transportation to the pass because it was thought to be too heavy for the various bridges along the route to the pass. Operationally, the locomotive didn't fare as well as was hoped due to its large cylinder size and small fire grate area (one fireman even commented disgustedly, \\"All Hell couldn't keep steam up in that engine!\\"). During initial shakedown runs around Sacramento, it was found, for example, that the engine's cylinders, which were originally built with innovative rotary valves, were not working properly. This necessitated casting an all-new set of cylinders with conventional slide valves and a Stephenson valve gear. Central Pacific attempted to further remedy the problems in an 1885 rebuild which increased the locomotive's weight to , with on the drivers. It was during this time that coal was apparently tried as a fuel in an effort to gain better steam economy. Several photographs exist of the locomotive in the Kernville yard, its tender loaded with coal instead the usual cord wood. In the railroad's 1891 renumbering plan, El Gobernador received road number 2050. The rebuild wasn't as successful as the railroad hoped and the locomotive was scrapped on July 15, 1894. After dismantling, the engine's massive boiler was used to provide steam for stationary engines in the railroad shops at Sacramento until scrapped in 1905.Joslyn, D. (1956). Steam Locomotives of the Southern Pacific. The Railway and Locomotive Historical Society Bulletin, (94), 155-169. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/43517808 Sadly, this engine appears to have largely been a victim of impatience on the part of the road's president, Leland Stanford. A locomotive this size had never been constructed before and proved to be a unique engineering challenge. For example, the engine's frame alone was so large, that it had to be cast in two separate sections instead of all at once as with other locomotives built at Sacramento. As soon as master mechanic A. J. Stevens was able to figure out a part, Stanford would order it built and installed on the new engine, without giving any proper time for testing. Stanford also apparently kept the other members of The Big Four (minus Mark Hopkins, who had died several years before) in the dark about the project as well. Once, while Stanford was away, Charles Crocker came through the locomotive works on a tour of inspection and saw the partially completed El Gobernador under construction. Having not been told about the project, he angrily demanded to know what they were up to. When told by A. J. Stevens that they were attempting to build the largest engine in the world, Crocker ordered all work stopped immediately. Meanwhile, Stanford returned to find that no new work had been done on the engine and when informed of the events that transpired, Crocker's orders were countermanded in no uncertain terms.

After a career that spanned eight decades, British illustrator Denis McLoughlin gained a degree of long overdue recognition in the late-1990s for his hard-boiled detective illustrations that graced book covers produced primarily for the London publishing house of T.V. Boardman, Ltd. (Boardman Books). It is this work, no doubt, with which McLoughlin will always be most strongly associated. Bio-bibliographer David Ashford claims for McLoughlin, \\"In the history of British Illustration there is no one who can be reasonably compared to him. He does not fit anywhere into the British tradition.\\" Ashford concludes that when it comes to hard-boiled illustration, McLoughlin is simply the best. Despite having produced over a hundred paperback covers, about 550 monthly Bloodhound Detective dust jacket illustrations, \\"scores\\" of Bloodhound Detective Story Magazine and other pulp magazine covers, and over a hundred other book covers, it is for his work in British comic books that Denis McLoughlin is best known. However, it would be impossible to consider the biography of Denis McLoughlin without touching the history of the Boardman publishing house at the same time. Biography Denis McLoughlin in his work room (circa 1980). He is holding a copy of the American first edition of his book Wild and Woolly: An Encyclopedia of the Old West. Note, also, the Western mural by McLoughlin. Early life and background Denis McLoughlin was born on 15 April 1918, in Bolton, Lancashire, England, where he still resided at the time of his death, 22 April 2002. Always interested in drawing, McLoughlin credits his artistic influence as film, pulp magazines (particularly the covers), and American comics. In the 1930s he collected American True Detective type magazines and American pulp magazines. McLoughlin also sought out the work of Alex Raymond (Flash Gordon, Secret Agent Corrigan) who he also calls an influence. On scholarship, in 1932, he attended the Bolton School of Art, which survives today as the Bolton College of Art, but left the same year for employment with Ward & Copley Art Studio of Oxford Road, Manchester. At Ward & Copley from 1932 until about January 1940 when lack of business ended his employment, McLoughlin found himself creating product illustrations for catalogues and newspaper advertisements for 10/- a week. Boardman Books T.V. Boardman, Ltd., was but one of many London publishing houses turning out both paperback and hardcover books, pulp magazines, and comics. Boardman pioneered British reprinting of American comics. During the week of 16 October 1937, the first issue of a Boardman tabloid comic in the traditional British format, Okay Comics Weekly, arrived at newsagents all over England. The content was mostly American newspaper strips and the first issue sported a cover strip by Will Eisner. Okay lasted only until 26 February 1938, or a total of twenty issues. At about this same time, other British publishers experimented with reprinting American comics and imports of the real thing began to land on British shores. It rapidly became apparent that a significant British market for American comic books existed. However, the British declaration of war on Germany on 3 September 1939, immediately halted the official importation of American comics into the United Kingdom although masses of American comics intended for G.I.s began arriving in 1942. Already with a taste for American comics, Thomas Volney Boardman, Sr., made an arrangement with Everett Arnold of Quality Comics to produce British editions of two titles, Feature Comics (#29‚Äì33) and Smash Comics (#7‚Äì11) all appearing in 1940‚Äì1941. Because Boardman needed low priced titles to please his primary outlet, WWoolworths Group's Department Stores, the British editions reprinted only about half the content of the American originals. To use the rest of the pages, Boardman created two additional corresponding titles in the American style, Super Funnies (#29‚Äì33) and Mystery Comics (#7‚Äì11). British Army in World War II Drafted in March 1940, Denis McLoughlin served with the Royal Artillery's 101st Light Anti-Aircraft (Ack-Ack) and Anti-Tank Regiment (later the 1st Armoured Brigade). He managed to practice his art by painting a rhino insignia on the regiment's vehicles and by painting at least 37 murals of different sizes in various military buildings. His unofficial position of regimental painter gained Denis much greater freedom than the common soldier and allowed him several opportunities to practice his art. In the beginning, he painted officer's portraits for 5/- each. Soon, however, a London publisher, Wells Gardner, Darton & Co., offered him work painting book covers at the rate of ¬£5 each. The first of these covers was for Frank Gruber's Navy Colt which appeared in 1943. Other covers followed for Wells Gardner, Darton & Co. which eventually recommended McLoughlin to Boardman Books. Having no work, however, Boardman passed Denis on to Australian owned Kangaroo Books. Kangaroo Books For Kangaroo Books (their logo looked amazingly like that of America's Pocket Books), McLoughlin painted a few paperback covers but primarily produced joke books. The publisher paid ¬£18 each for these which included writing about 50 jokes, illustrating them, and producing the cover. After doing the first joke book, probably Laughter for the Home Front, solo, McLoughlin enlisted the aid of his brother Colin (b. 2 November 1925) with the writing chore. Thus began a working relationship between the McLoughlin brothers that would last at least into the 1950s and that produced New Laughs for All, Laugh While You Work, You've Had It, and This Is It for Kangaroo. It was for Kangaroo books that Denis McLoughlin produced his first comic book work. He created an eight-page adaptation of General George Armstrong Custer's last stand based primarily on his hazy memory of the film They Died With Their Boots On. The story seems likely to have seen publication in an unnumbered and undated 3d (three pence, that is) issue of Lightning Comics sometime between 1943 and January 1946. McLoughlin at Boardman Books Denis McLoughlin's \\"official\\" association with Boardman began after his January 1946 military discharge and took the form of a three-year book cover contract. Of McLoughlin's extensive cover work for Boardman Books a great deal could be said. However, in late 1947, T.V. Boardman, Sr., decided to go after a portion of the market for \\"American style\\" comic books left unfilled by the departure of the American army and the British governments continued ban on comic book importation. Boardman's re-entry into the comic field took place during a post-war comics publishing boom in England. McLoughlin's contribution to Boardman's comic publishing caused author Denis Gifford to call him \\"Boardman's one-man art department.\\" Beginning in 1948, Boardman's comic book production followed two paths, inexpensive rotogravure comic books and lavishly produced comic annual publications . Rotogravure Series Boardman's three pence rotogravure series began monthly production in February 1948. Issues were twelve pages long and used both front and back covers as story pages. They were printed in three colours (generally black, white, and red or green) on clay coated paper and saddle-stitched at the spine. In American publishing, they most closely resemble Will Eisner's Spirit Sunday newspaper inserts. Mildly inspired by Alex Raymond, Denis and Colin filled the first seven issues with the adventures of detective Roy Carson and adventure/science fiction hero Swift Morgan alternately. Although titles changed with each issue, numbering remained consistent to the entire series. Issue eight saw the addition of Lennart Ek's Buffalo Bill reprinted from a Swiss source but always repackaged by Denis. Eventually, Denis would create some original Buffalo Bill stories for the series but his involvement with other projects for Boardman caused the reprint content of the rotogravure series to increase. Still holding the rights to material from Quality Comics, Blackhawk (at least sixteen issues) and the Spirit (probably only two issues) were added to the rotation of titles. These reprints were always repackaged by Denis McLoughlin. The twelve-page rotogravure format lasted for 44 issues until October 1951. In February 1953, the series numbering continued but with color covers and black & white interiors until probably sometime in 1954. It seems possible that number 61, featuring Blackhawk, was the last issue. Rebound newsagent returns of the rotogravure series were released as Super Colour Annuals (there were three, 1949‚Äì1951). Buffalo Bill Wild West Annuals One reason for McLoughlin's partial withdrawal from the rotogravure series late in 1948 was undoubtedly the introduction of Christmas annuals to the Boardman line under their Popular Press imprint. The first of these, Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual number one, appeared in time for the 1949 Christmas market. The book's production was rushed because T.V. Boardman, Sr., did not decide to proceed with the project until the last minute. Success of the experiment assured that the title would continue and another Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual appeared in time for Christmas every year through the 1961 issue. Given the success of Buffalo Bill, it is hardly surprising that the \\"Adventure\\" annual series was soon added to the Popular Press offerings. Both annual series offered a mixture of American comic reprints (mostly from Quality) combined with British original comic stories (almost always by the brothers McLoughlin), text features, puzzles, gags, and games. After the 1948 issue, each Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual took Denis, who had almost total creative control over the project, about six months to produce. He began with a blank dummy of the Annual and positioned each story and feature to get the layout. T.V. Boardman had to approve each project and a representative of Woolworth's Department Stores, which were the primary outlet for the annuals, had final veto power. McLoughlin obviously lavished his attention on the Buffalo Bill annuals. Here his graphic story-telling reached new heights. As the series progressed the amount of research for each story obviously increased contributing a high degree of realism to the series. By the last few annuals almost all of the stories were based on solid history. \\"Ghost Towns,\\" for example, in 1958's Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual number ten provides a poignant comment on the passing of the American West with a level of understanding unique for the time and seldom seen in comic book westerns of any period. Adventure Annuals Series Denis McLoughlin had the same creative control over the \\"adventure\\" annual series. Unlike the Buffalo Bill annuals, the Adventure series was not numbered. It also tended to contain a much higher percentage of reprinted American material and shows evidence of much less research. The first of these publications was Ajax Adventure Annual which appeared in 1952. The order of the adventure series is probably Ajax Adventure Annual in 1952; Adventure Annual, 1953; New Spaceways Comic Annual No. 1, 1954; Okay Adventure Annual, 1955‚Äì1957; Okay Annual of Adventure Stories, 1958‚Äì1959; and the First Book of Heroes, c. 1959/60. Both Adventure Annual and New Spaceways Comic Annual feature Roy Carson and Swift Morgan stories. New Spaceways also features a variety of Quality super-hero reprints including Plastic Man and Doll Man and has art by Reed Crandall and Matt Baker, making it, of all the Boardman annuals, the most desirable to collectors in the United States. The First Book of Heroes was designed by McLoughlin but only has one page of his art. Decline of Boardman Books With the single exception of the Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual, by the mid to late-1950s, Boardman comics were no more and, after the 1961 issue, Buffalo Bill folded as well. Denis McLoughlin continued to illustrate book covers for Boardman Books until 1967, when the company folded. Even prior to Boardman's demise, McLoughlin turned to other publishers for work. Even though Boardman retained the copyright, the last four Buffalo Bill annuals were prepared for Dean & Son Publishing, Ltd., and printed by Purnell & Sons, Ltd., both London firms. After Boardman folded, McLoughlin helped produce several western annuals for Purnell all based on American Western TV shows: The Dakotas Annual for 1963 and 1964, Gunsmoke Annual for 1965‚Äì1967, and Bonanza Annual for 1969. McLoughlin after Boardman In 1967, McLoughlin went to work for IPC, then the largest comic publisher in the United Kingdom. He took over the art chores on \\"Saber\\" (kind of a blonde Tarzan) and also drew \\"Big Hit Swift\\" (a cricket strip which McLoughlin detested) for the pages of Tiger. From 20 March to 21 October 1971, McLoughlin illustrated \\"Fury's Family\\" about a boy and his menagerie for Lion. McLoughlin then took about two years off from comics to finish the compilation of Wild & Woolly, his encyclopaedia of the American West published by Doubleday in 1974. Although McLoughlin had been promised that he would be able to return to IPC, no stories were made available after the book project was finished. D.C. Thomson and Co., Ltd. After sending art samples, McLoughlin found stories to illustrate for the Scottish publishing firm D.C. Thomson and Co., Ltd., in 1974. He has been working for them ever since and contributed to just about all of their adventure titles (all of which are now defunct) including Wizard, Victor, Buddy, Crunch, Bullet, and Scoop. Primarily, however, McLoughlin's work appeared in Wizard. At his height with the company (22 October 1977), five McLoughlin stories graced the pages of two Thomson titles, Wizard and Bullet. Perhaps the best regarded of McLoughlin's strips for Thomson were \\"Sign of the Shark\\" featuring x-agent Jake Jeffords, \\"The Green Lizard\\" which was a science fiction tale, and \\"The Shark\\" featuring the crew of a German E-Boat during World War II. Unfortunately, the days of the traditional British comic story paper were already numbered by the late-1970s and by 1983, most ceased publication. Denis drew two western features for the 1983 Look and Learn Annual before beginning his monthly stint for Thomson's Commando, a 64-page war comic digest which sees four issues released twice a month (96 issues a year). McLoughlin produced about one issue of Commando a month until his death on 22 April 2002. Death Exactly a week after his 84th birthday and while in good health, Denis McLoughlin committed suicide. He used a Colt revolver that had been part of his reference collection for years and that friends and family thought was non-functioning. The cause of Denis' death was not immediately revealed in the British press. Exactly why he chose to end his life can never be known. However, he had survived all of the persons dearest to him including his wife, Dorothy, and brother, Colin. Denis and Dorothy had no children. Like many others who devoted their life to commercial art in the first half of the 20th century, Denis McLoughlin was never paid a great deal for his work. Many pieces of his artwork, the Boardman book covers in particular, which Denis had been promised would be returned to him, were either lost or ended up in private collections. While he made a living, Denis never accumulated much money. Although he had a pension from the British government, he was forced to augment his income by working long past retirement age. He once commented that he never particularly liked illustrating military topics and yet that is what he found himself doing for the last 20 years of his life. Perhaps, had he been given cowboy stories to illustrate, he might have been happier. Comicography Because it has no overall title, Boardman Books' Rotogravure series is listed first.

Adventure Annual Series These volumes, traditional British comic and story annuals, were published each year in time for Christmas shopping. They are cloth bound with full-color painted covers and probably came with dust jackets that duplicated the illustrations on the board covers. These dust jackets, however, are seldom found. Interior contents are a mix of original British material (often by McLoughlin) and reprints from American comics, usually Quality. Primary distribution came through the Woolworth's chain where toys matching characters and vehicles from the stories were also on sale. Little is known about the original pricing of the volumes although some are thought to have been priced at 7/6. No issues were numbered or dated and the order given here may not be entirely accurate. It is clear, however, that the order of issues presented in several British fanzines and publications is hopelessly wrong. It seems likely that the three Supercoloured Comic Annuals and the New Spaceways Comic Annual should be considered part of this series. This would give it an unbroken run of one annual a year from 1949 to 1959 which would nearly correspond with the Buffalo Bill series. Copies of each of these annuals with dated gift inscriptions confirm that the estimate of dates is fairly accurate. British collector Paul Annis' research confirms most of these dates. *(1) 1952 Ajax Adventure Annual Elephant Cover *(2) 1953 Adventure Annual \\"The Robot Empire\\" Swift Morgan / \\"Roy Carson and the Old Master\\" *(3) 1954 New Spaceways Comic Annual No. 1 Swift Morgan cover.

This story was actually a Boardman reject and was reproduced from artwork that Denis considered unfinished. Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual Nearly identical in design to the Adventure Annual series, Buffalo Bill Annual was T.V. Boardman's most successful comic/story annual series. Beginning in 1949, the Buffalo Bill series lasted until 1961. Unlike the Adventure series, Buffalo Bill was produced almost entirely in England (except for portions of the 1952 issue which were reprinted from American sources). As good as Denis McLoughlin's work on other Boardman titles was, it steps up to another level in the Buffalo Bill Annuals. Here McLoughlin's passion for the American West found the outlet it had been denied in the three pence rotogravure series. Only comic stories are listed here but McLoughlin provided dozens of text illustrations, decorated maps, and paintings in each volume. Boardman also lavished production values on these annuals allowing more full-color painted artwork, more four-color comic stories, and more original material. Rather than the superficial treatment of the American West found in other children's publications, McLoughlin, with writers Arthur Groom, Rex James, and Colin McLoughlin (Denis' brother), produced intelligent and historically accurate pieces. Unlike the Adventure Annual series, Buffalo Bill is always dated and/or numbered. Several were published under the Popular Press imprint. =Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual No. 1 (1949)= *Written by Arthur Groome and illustrated by Denis McLoughlin. **Enter Buffalo Bill (origin) **Weapons of the West **Bandit Game **Round Up **Calamity Jane (origin) **Lessons of Buffalo Bill **Cowboy's Kit **Terror of the Range **Wild Bill's First 'Killing' **Chief White Owl **Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show =Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual No. 2 (1950)= *Written by Arthur Groome and illustrated by Denis McLoughlin. **Fight **Camp **Red Men of the West **Historical Wanderers **Oregon Trail **Bad Men **They Brought Law to the West **Curiosities of the West **$15,000,000 Ranch =Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual No. 3 (1951)= *Written by Arthur Groome and illustrated by Denis McLoughlin. **Gold **Battle of Beecher's Island **Overcoat **Wells Fargo Company **Great Indian Flood **Coffin Crooks **Panther **Indian Joe =Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual No. 4 (1952)= *Written by Arthur Groome and illustrated by Denis McLoughlin. **Gunfighter **Cannonball Green **Counterfeit Whip (US reprint) **Two-Gun Lil- Six-Guns From the Sky (US reprint) **Great Cochise **Bob Allen Frontier Marshal- Fastest Gun in the West (US reprint) **Bob Allen Frontier Marshal- Gun-Slinger's Gratitude (US reprint) **Saga of Salt Lake City **Saddle **Coyote =Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual No. 5 (1953)= *Written by Arthur Groome Illustrated by Denis McLoughlin. **Deadwood Coach **Cherokee Strip **Man From Texas **Highlights of a Dangerous Life **Ghost Riders **Diggings **Pony Express **Dime Novel King (Ned Buntline) =Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual No. 6 (1954)= *Written by Arthur Groome and illustrated by Denis McLoughlin. **Second Sitting Bull **Buffalo Bill‚ÄîIndian Fighter **Benson Stage **Wordless Language **Arizona Cattle War **They Led the Red Men **Boy General **Whispering Wires **One Man Against a Nation =Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual No. 7 (1955)= *Written by Rex James and Colin McLoughlin.

These digest size comics have been part of the British comics market since July 1961. They are still being issued at the rate of four issues every two weeks and, so far, there are over 3,500 issues. Starting with #1623 Fight Back which was published in late July 1982, Denis McLoughlin contributed about one issue every five to six weeks until the time of his death. Since then, issues of Commando frequently reprint stories illustrated by McLoughlin. So far 171 issues have been identified as being illustrated by Denis McLoughlin between July 1982 and October 2002. Lightning Comics *Published by Kangaroo Books in about 1946. New Spaceways Comic Annual No. 1 (1954) *Includes reprints of three Boardman rotogravure comics as well as various other McLoughlin illustrations. Denis McLoughlin, creative director for the series, based most of the spacemen, rockets, flying saucers, space creatures, robots, etc. on the toys then carried by Woolworth's. Woolworth's were the primary distributor of the Boardman annuals in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and all over the former British Empire. Some of the Pyro/Kleeware/Tudor Rose toys used as models for this annual include: X-300 Space Cruiser (silver ‚Äì top front cover); X-300 Space Cruiser (landed ‚Äì front cover foreground); Johillco Spacemen (front cover); and Tudor Rose Space Clipper (front cover bottom left inset). *The comic contents include three British original stories by Denis McLoughlin and a third by an unknown artist. One McLoughlin story features hard boiled detective Roy Carson while the other has science fiction hero Swift Morgan. The story Swift Morgan and the Flying Saucers is a reprint from 1949. As such, it is a very early UFO story. The other comic content is reprinted (in color and black and white) from US Quality Comics Group. Comic content includes: **Zip O'Daly Rocket Ship Pilot (British original?) **Swift Morgan and the Flying Saucers by Denis McLoughlin **Eric Falcon ‚Äì The Surrender of Eric Falcon **Chop Chop by Matt Baker **Plastic Man ‚Äì Grandma Crookes by Jack Cole **The Whip ‚Äì Crimson Vengeance (origin) by Reed Crandall **Doll Man ‚Äì The Full Moon Monster **Corsair Queen ‚Äì King of Corpse Cay **Swift Morgan and the Ancient Egyptians by Denis McLoughlin **Roy Carson Strikes Again by Denis McLoughlin **Arizona Raines Water Hogs Die Broke might be by Matt Baker Purnell Annuals *Shortly after T.V. Boardman ceased publication of all comic annuals, Purnell purchased Dean (Dean had published the last four of the \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Annuals). Despite still having plenty of work provided by Boardman for their Bloodhound Mystery series of hardcovers, paperbacks, and pulp magazines, McLoughlin was enticed to work on a number of comic annual projects for Purnell. All were based on American TV Westerns. **Dakotas Annual (1963 (1), published September 1962) McLoughlin endpapers, text illustrations for one story, and three comic stories. **Dakotas Annual (1964 (2), published September 1963) McLoughlin endpapers, text illustrations, and comic stories. **Gunsmoke Annual (1964 (1), published September 1963) \\"New Stories Based on the Famous Television Series.\\" Again, McLoughlin endpapers, text illustrations, and comic stories. Some parties consider the first Gunsmoke Annual to be McLoughlin's finest work in western comics. **Gunsmoke Annual (1965 (2), published September 1964) McLoughlin endpapers, text illustrations, and comic stories. **Gunsmoke Annual (1966 (3), published September 1965) McLoughlin endpapers, text illustrations, and comic stories. **Gunsmoke Annual (1967 (4), published September 1966) McLoughlin endpapers, text illustrations, and comic stories. **Bonanza Annual (1968, published September 1967) McLoughlin cover only.

The company offers a wide range of lottery, sports and instant games in the Norwegian market. Norsk Tipping is owned by the Norwegian government and administered by Norwegian Ministry of Culture. Ever since Norsk Tipping started in 1948, the idea has been that the profit from company‚Äôs operations would be channelled back to the Norwegian sport and cultural sector. During 60 years of activity, Norsk Tipping have given its profits to such purposes. History Football pools were the only game when the Norsk Tipping AS was founded in 1948. At that time organisation was run as a limited company with the Norwegian State holding 40%, the Norwegian Sports Federation 40% and the Norwegian Football Association 20%. The profit was at first shared between sports and research projects. Today the company also raises money for culture causes, and the surplus is divided 50/50 between sports and culture. In 1993 the Norwegian State took full ownership over the company. Norsk Tipping‚Äôs website was established in 1999 with results service and daily updating of the information for players. In 2001 after the page was tested Norsk Tipping started to offer its products on the Internet. In November 2005 Norsk Tipping started to provide most of the games via mobile phones. Games The company operates the games of chance, Lotto, Viking Lotto, Keno and Joker; the games of skill Tipping and Oddsen, and the scratch game Flax. In addition, the company operates the TV game, Extra, on behalf of the Norwegian Foundation for Health and Rehabilitation. Norsk Tipping also provide the games via mobile phones and Internet. All games from Norsk Tipping except Flax requires the player to be registered and have a playcard. Lotto Lotto is a money game established in 1986 and modeled after similar games in other countries. The drawing of numbers is done every week live on NRK. In 2004 Norwegians played Lotto for 3,5 billion Norwegian kroner, making it the largest game in the country. In the pot are 34 numbers, and of these seven are drawn as main series numbers, while three additional numbers are drawn for determining certain consolation prizes. Prizes are awarded for (in descending value) #7 correct numbers #6 correct numbers + at least 1 additional number #6 correct numbers #5 correct numbers #4 correct numbers + at least 1 additional number Half of the income collected from people participating is distributed back as prizes.

His books have been translated in 30 languages. He was the first President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with his tenure lasting from 1992 to 1993. Admirers sometimes refer to him as the Father of the Nation due to his influence on modern Serbian politics and the national revival movement in the late 1980s while his opponents use that term in an ironic manner. Early life and career ƒÜosiƒá was born as Dobrosav ƒÜosiƒá on 29 December 1921 in the Serbian village of Velika Drenova near Trstenik to parents father ≈Ωika and mother Milka (d. 15 October 1984). Some sources have incorrectly stated his date of birth as 4 January 1922. Before the Second World War he was able to attend vocational agriculture school in Aleksandrovac. He joined the communist youth organization in Negotin in 1939. When the Second World War reached Yugoslavia in 1941, he joined the communist partisans. After the liberation of Belgrade in October 1944, he remained active in communist leadership positions, including work in the Serbian republican Agitation and Propaganda commission and then as a people's representative from his home region. In the early 1950s, he visited the Goli otok concentration camp, where the Yugoslav authorities imprisoned political opponents of the Communist Party. ƒÜosiƒá maintained that he did so in order to better understand the Stalinist mind. In 1956 he found himself in Budapest during the Hungarian revolt. He arrived there for the meeting of the editors of literary magazines in socialist countries on the day when the revolution started and remained there until October 31 when he was transported back to Belgrade on a plane that brought in Yugoslav Red Cross help. It remains unclear whether this was purely a coincidence or he was sent there as a Yugoslav secret agent. Nevertheless, he even held political speeches in favor of a revolution in Budapest and upon his return he wrote a detailed report on the matter which, by some opinions, greatly affected and shaped firm official Yugoslav view on the whole situation. Parts of his memories and thoughts on the circumstances later will be published under the name Seven Days in Budapest. In opposition Until the early 1960s, ƒÜosiƒá was devoted to Marshal Tito and his vision of a harmonious Yugoslavia. In 1961, he joined Tito on a 72-day tour by presidential yacht (the Galeb) to visit eight African non-aligned countries. The trip aboard the Galeb highlighted the close, affirmative relationship that ƒÜosiƒá had with the administration until the early 1960s. Between 1961 and 1962, ƒÜosiƒá got involved in a lengthy polemic with the Slovenian intellectual Du≈°an Pirjevec regarding the relationship between autonomy, nationalism and centralism in Yugoslavia. Pirjevec voiced the opinions of the Communist Party of Slovenia which supported a more decentralized development of Yugoslavia with respect for local autonomies, while ƒÜosiƒá argued for a stronger role of the Federal authorities, warning against the rise of peripheral nationalisms. The polemic, which was the first public and open confrontation of different visions within the Yugoslav Communist Party after World War II, ended with Tito's support of ƒÜosiƒá's arguments. Nevertheless, actual political measures undertaken after 1962 actually followed the positions voiced by Pirjevec and the Slovenian Communist leadership. As the government gradually decentralized administration of Yugoslavia after 1963, ƒÜosiƒá grew convinced that the Serbian population of the state was imperiled. In May 1968, he gave a celebrated speech to the Fourteenth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Serbian League of Communists, in which he condemned the then-current nationalities policy in Yugoslavia. He was especially upset at the regime's inclination to grant greater autonomy to Kosovo and Vojvodina. Thereafter he acted as a dissident. In the 1980s, following the death of Tito, ƒÜosiƒá helped organize and lead a movement whose original goal was to gain equality for Serbia in the Yugoslav federation, but which rapidly became intense and aggressive. He was especially enthusiastic in his advocacy of the rights of the Serb and Montenegrin populations of Kosovo. ƒÜosiƒá was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and is considered by many to have been its most influential member. While ƒÜosiƒá has been credited with writing the Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, which appeared in unfinished fashion in the Serbian public in 1986, he in fact was not responsible for its writing. In 1989 he endorsed the leadership of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, and two years later he helped raise Radovan Karad≈æiƒá to the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs. When war broke out in 1991, he supported the Serbian effort. President of FR Yugoslavia President of FR Yugoslavia with Prime Minister of FR Yugoslavia Milan Paniƒá in the Yugoslav parliament building In 1992, he became the president of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which consisted of Serbia and Montenegro. On Eastern Orthodox Christmas Eve of January 1993, ƒÜosiƒá appeared on Serbian television to warn of demands for ‚Äúnational capitulation‚Äù from the West. \\"If we don't accept, we are going to be put in a concentration camp and face an attack by the most powerful armies of the world\\". These outside forces, he said, are determined to subordinate \\"the Serbian people to Muslim hegemony.\\"\\"Serbia's Spite\\", Time Magazine, 25 January 1993. His support was important in the rise to power of Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic. Liberal Serbs saw Cosic as one of the key people behind the Greater Serbia project an idea pushed forward by the Serbian nationalists who wanted to unite Serbia with Serb-populated areas of Croatia and Bosnia. Later ƒÜosiƒá turned against Milo≈°eviƒá, and was removed from his position for that reason. In 2000, ƒÜosiƒá publicly joined Otpor!, an underground anti-Milo≈°eviƒá organization. Nobel prize hoax In 2011, an internet hoax led to state-run Serbian television announcing wrongly that ƒÜosiƒá had been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. That honour had in fact gone to Tomas Transtr√∂mer.Internet Hoax Has Serb Writer as Nobel Winner, ABC News, 6 October 2011. ƒÜosiƒá and Chomsky In 2006, ƒÜosiƒá received support for his proposal for a partition of Kosovo by Noam Chomsky. In a Serbian television interview, Chomsky was asked what the best solution for Kosovo's final status is. He responded: > My feeling has been for a long time that the only realistic solution is one > that in fact was offered by the President of Serbia [i.e. Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá, > then President of Yugoslavia] I think back round 1993, namely some kind of > partition, with the Serbian, by now very few Serbs left but the, what were > the Serbian areas being part of Serbia and the rest be what they called > \\"independent\\" which means it'll join Albania. I just don't see‚Ä¶I didn't see > any other feasible solution ten years ago. Personal life In 1947, he married his wife Bo≈æica (1928‚Äì2005) with whom he had a daughter named Ana. Death and legacy ƒÜosiƒá's gravesite A street at Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac was named after ƒÜosiƒá Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá died on 18 May 2014 in his home in Belgrade at the age of 92. He was interred in a family plot at the Belgrade New Cemetery next to his wife on 20 May 2014. In March 2019, a street in Belgrade was named after him.

After training, the regiment embarked to northern France, arriving in early spring 1918. Elements of the 327th Infantry moved up to the front lines at the end of that summer. On 9 June 1918, Cpt Jewett Williams became the first man in the regiment killed in combat.The 327th Under Fire: History of the 327th infantry Regiment, 82nd division in the Great War by George McIntosh Sparks, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, 1920 Page 12 The 82nd Infantry Division's first exposure to combat, as a division, occurred on 25 June when it was assigned to the Lagney sector. While this was earmarked as a quiet sector, the 327th actively patrolled and executed raids for several weeks.The 327th Under Fire: History of the 327th infantry Regiment, 82nd division in the Great War by George McIntosh Sparks, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, 1920 Page 16  Saint-Mihiel  THE 82nd Division was occupying the Marbache sector in the Moselle Valley with orders to protect the flank of attacking U.S. forces. But as the Germans were reinforcing this sector in anticipation of a coming Allied offensive, the Division ordered a series of raids to mislead the Germans on the exact location of attacking units. The 327th Infantry, conducted a raid on a German strongpoint known as the Bel Air Farm on 13 September with 2 companies, E and K, as the assault force. After initial success the assault group was pushed back to the original U.S. lines. E & K companies suffered 6 dead, 11 severely wounded, 69 wounded and 10 missing.Official History of the 82nd Division: American Expeditionary Force, 1917‚Äì1919, Bobbs-Merill, Indianapolis, Ind., 1920) page 31 The 82nd continued operations in Saint-Mihiel until, on 17 September, it was relieved by troops of the 90th Infantry Division just west of the Moselle River. The 82nd Division went into reserve to prepare for the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, but the 327th was attached to the 28th Division and remained on the front until early October.  Meuse-Argonne  The 82nd Division was given a new axis of advance early in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive to attack and fill a gap to the left flank of the 28th Infantry Division which was advancing to capture Hill 223 as part of operations to rescue the 77th Infantry Division's Lost Battalion. On the night of 6/7 October 1918, the regiment relieved troops on the left of the 28th Division on the Aire River. On 7 October, it attacked toward the Argonne Forest, making some progress toward Cornay. On 8 October rescuers reached the Lost Battalion. The next day the 327th continued to attack towards the high ground northwest of Ch√¢tel-Ch√©h√©ry. The 327th then continued to fight in the Ardennes region, capturing Conray and Hill 180. On 4 November the regiment was pulled from the line and moved into training area; it was there when it learned of the 11 November Armistice.Official History of the 82nd Division: American Expeditionary Force, 1917‚Äì1919, Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis, IN, 1920 The 327th Infantry suffered 331 killed in action, 73 died of wounds and 1959 wounded in the First World War.\\"82nd Division: Summary of Operations by the American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Printing Office 1944\\". Reviewed on 7 February 2018. Members of the 327th were awarded 7 Distinguished Services Crosses (DSC), including one for the 2-327th Commander- Lt Col Harold W. Blanchard.  World War II = Normandy  Part of the 82nd Infantry Division was transferred to the 101st Airborne Division 15 August 1942. All equipment and personnel assigned to the regiment were designed to be carried in the Waco CG-4A glider. Although a glider infantry regiment, the majority of the unit landed by sea on Utah Beach in the afternoon of 7 June 1944, because of a shortage of planes to tow its gliders. Some elements did reach shore on D-Day, 6 June, but because of rough seas, beach traffic, and the fact that the paratroopers of the 101st had already achieved many of their objectives, the landing was delayed. The 327th suffered a few casualties going ashore from enemy fire and were strafed by enemy aircraft. Near Ste. Come DuMont (southeast of the village), the 327th was camped right next to German paratroopers, separated by thick hedgerows. German-speaking soldiers in the 327th engaged in taunting the enemy. The 327th took several casualties by enemy mortars. By 8 June, the 327th had entered the front line, largely in reserve of the 506th until crossing the Douve River near Carentan. First and Second Battalions guarded Utah Beachhead's left flank northeast of Carentan. Company C was hit hard by friendly fire mortars while crossing the Douve. Official findings blamed enemy mines. Company B also suffered casualties in the incident. The 327th suffered heavy casualties while advancing on Carentan via what is now the city Marina from a northeast direction and other casualties approaching Carentan from the east. G Company led the attack on the west bank of the marina canal. A Company of the attached 401st Glider Infantry Regiment was on the east bank of the canal. Concealed German machine guns and mortars inflicted the most casualties. Chaplain Gordon Cosby earned a Silver Star for bravery in the face of the enemy for assisting wounded glider men in front of heavily armed German soldiers. The 327th played a pivotal role with the 501st and 506th of the 101st in taking Carentan. The 327th marched through the town and East to be possibly the first unit of the Utah Beachhead to link up with the Omaha Beachhead around the four-villages area of le Fourchette, le Mesnil, le Rocher and Cotz. It was then directed South between the bulk of the 101st and the 75th Infantry Division of the Omaha Beachhead. The unit was commanded by Col. George S. Wear through 10 June, when command was turned over to Col. Joseph H. Harper. Although not official, the men of the 327th understood that Wear was replaced because of friendly-fire artillery casualties while crossing the Douve River. Officially, enemy mortars were blamed.  The Netherlands  The regiment played a pivotal role in Operation Market Garden battle near Best, in the Netherlands, encircling a large German force which had been pressured from the west by the tank-supported 502nd of the 101st. Sgt. Manuel Hidalgo and Lt. Hibbard of G Company risked their lives in a humanitarian effort to get the enemy to surrender before being annihilated by the 327th. In the Market Garden operations, some companies in the 327th suffered two-thirds casualty rates before arriving at Opheusden. 2nd Battalion, especially Company G, suffered heavy casualties from a brutal shelling in the churchyard at Veghel. The large artillery shells were launched from the Erp vicinity. Dutch collaborators aided German scouts and were executed by the Dutch underground after the shelling. At Opheusden, the 327th withstood repeated assaults by the enemy and heavy artillery barrages. In Rendezvous with Destiny, Rapport and Arthur cite British officers that indicated that the barrage suffered by the 327 was as intense as anything they had seen, and rivaled what the British pummeled the Germans with at El Alamein in North Africa. The fighting along the west and northwest perimeter in the Ophuesden (the Island) area was as intense as any fighting in the area. E Company engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy near the railroad track switch house south of Opheusden. The enemy repeatedly hurled their units unsuccessfully at the glider men and suffered high casualties.  Bastogne  At Bastogne, Belgium, the 327 held half of the perimeter (including the 401, which was acting as the Regiment's 3rd Battalion and later officially became a part of the 327). Numerous intense fights erupted along the 327 sector including two brutal fights at Marvie and more to the west in the 401 section. The Germans attacking were of the Volksgrenadiers and the elite tank-based Panzer Lehr. At Marvie the 327 was outnumbered by 15 to 1. Facing only two US companies, G Company, supported by several tanks from the 10th Armored Division and E Company in reserve, the German commander took his whole division further west. At Marvie, the Germans lost six tanks and several half tracks. One tank did break into Marvie, but was destroyed trying to make a run towards Bastogne. Several days later, during the night of 23 December, the enemy attacked in force with tanks. The road through Marvie was blocked when G Company mistook a US tank destroyer for a German tank and destroyed it on the village bridge. The Germans overran Hill 500 just to the west of Marvie and broke through the gap between F and G Company. The enemy then put rear pressure on the F Company Command Post. A platoon sized paratrooper element came to support F Company. The German forces managed to place tanks behind US lines between Marvie and Bastogne. The glider men of Company G and Company F were pushed back from 500 to 1,000 yards during the intense fighting, but did not break. Unable to make quick progress, the Germans pressed the attack until morning, but withdrew when the German Command Center was destroyed by US artillery. Again, the 327 was badly outnumbered by the enemy. After the break through by General Patton's tanks, the 327th proceeded to the north sector of the Bastogne theater of operations. There, 2nd Battalion was involved in clearing Champs after a German armored element broke through paratrooper lines. Companies A and C suffered intense casualties and were consolidated into one company call ACE. Later, the 327 made an open field maneuver against armored enemy troops east of Foy, which helped secure that village. The ferocity and speed of the open-field attack surprised the Germans and the paratrooper regiments on the flanks of the attack. German forces attacked the flank and surrounded ACE Company in Bois Jacques. After that, the enemy was primarily in withdrawal mode back to Germany. The 327 often is slighted by fans of the 101st Airborne Division as riding in a glider is not deemed as perilous as parachuting in battle. Several companies of the 327 suffered casualty rates as high or higher than many paratrooper regiments. Some companies, such as A, C, and G, and the 401st took casualties as severe as the most engaged paratrooper regiments. On D+2, glider flights into Market Garden suffered a 30% loss of gliders. Later, the 327 was involved in action near Hagenau, France in Alsace.  Post WWII  Inactivated on 30 November 1945 in France, the regiment was redesignated as the 516th Airborne Infantry Regiment on 18 June 1948 and active from 6 July 1948 to 1 April 1949 and from 25 August 1950 to 1 December 1953 at Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky. As was the case with many combat divisions of World War II fame, the colors of the 101st Airborne Division and its subordinate elements were active only as training units and were not organized as parachute or glider units. On 27 April 1954 the 516th was relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division and activated at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on 15 May 1954, again as a training unit. On 1 July 1956 it was reorganized and redesignated as the 327th Airborne Infantry Regiment, an element of the 101st. On 25 April 1957 the colors of Company A, 327AIR were reorganized and redesignated as HHC, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 327th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated). This was the only active element of the 327th Infantry during the Pentomic era. When the Army abandoned battle groups for brigades and battalions, the unit was reorganized and redesignated on 3 February 1963 as the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry, an element of the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. On 21 January 1964 the lineage of the former Company B, 327AIR was redesignated as HHC, 2d Battalion, 327th Infantry, assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted) and activated on 3 February 1963, also as an element of the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division.  Vietnam  As elements of the 1st Brigade, the 1st and 2nd Battalions 327th Infantry deployed to Vietnam in 1965, where they were joined by the rest of the division in late 1967. The 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry, was the last unit of the 101st Airborne to leave Vietnam, departing in April 1972, making it the longest serving unit in combat during the Vietnam War. While still at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, the remaining elements of the 101st were severely stripped of personnel to support the war effort. When ordered to deploy, it was necessary to fill empty manning slots with non-airborne-qualified soldiers, effectively making these units of the division airborne in name only. In mid-1968, the army created a second airmobile division (the other being the 1st Cavalry Division) by reorganizing the 101st and its subordinate elements, to include the battalions of the 327th Infantry. The division has remained a helicopter-deployed unit to the present day.  Post-war reorganization  During the early 1980s the army adopted a battalion rotation program that paired combat battalions based in the continental United States with those stationed overseas. As part of this program, the lineage of the former Company C, 327AIR was redesignated on 21 January 1983 as HHC, 3d Battalion, 327th Infantry, and assigned to the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). This was accomplished by reflagging the existing 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry. In Alaska the existing infantry battalions of the 172nd Infantry Brigade were reflagged as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, 327th Infantry, with the three \\"C\\" companies' back on airborne status, thus reactivating the lineages of the former companies D, E, and F, 327AIR. The rotational program was later abandoned and the Alaska-based battalions were reflagged again, leaving only the Fort Campbell-based battalions with 327th designations. When the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) was inactivated and replaced by the newly re-activated 6th Infantry Division (Light) in 1986; the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, 327th Infantry were also inactivated and replaced by the 1st and 2nd Battalion, 17th Infantry (Fort Richardson, AK); and the 4th and 5th Battalion, 9th Infantry (Fort Wainwright, AK).  Operation Desert Storm  In 1990 the 1st BCT (including the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 327th) was deployed to Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Shield. The 1st BCT established defensive positions north of Tap Line Road approximately south of the Iraq border. On 17 January the 327th Infantry Regiment conducted a ground movement to Camp Eagle II in preparation for deployment into Iraq. Over the course of the next week the regiment regrouped and by C-130 and ground convey repositioned to RaFa in northern Saudi Arabia and further into TAA Campbell where it remained for approximately 30 days. With the commencement of ground operations, under the command of Colonel Tom Hill the 327th conducted the deepest and largest air assault operation in history establishing FOB Cobra approximately inside Iraq. Subordinate elements were 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Battalion commanded by LTC Frank R. Hancock, 2nd Battalion, 327th commanded by LTC Charles Garey Thomas, 3rd Battalion 327th commanded by LTC (P) Gary J. Bridges and 1st Battalion 502nd commanded by LTC Jim Donald. 2nd Battalion 320 FA artillery was commanded by LTC Lynn Hartsell. The 3rd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment conducted a second air assault operation to seize FOB White under the command of 2nd Brigade 101st Airborne Division for further seal the defeat of Iraqi forces. Not a single 101st Airborne Division soldier was lost.  Operation Iraqi Freedom  In early 2003 the entire 101st Airborne Division deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom where the 1st Brigade Combat Team made up of the 327th Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel Ben Hodges and its support elements prepared for battle at Camp Pennsylvania. The majority of the 327th Infantry Regiment later shifted to Camp Udairi, Kuwait and from there, conducted a massive air assault into southern Iraq while other soldiers crossed the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border in a massive maneuver known as a GAC, or Ground Assault Convoy. Once in Iraq, the 327th encountered heavy to light resistance from both fleeing Iraqi soldiers as well as the Fedayeen Saddam and other less organized fighters. The 327th fought through An Najaf, Al Kufa, Karbala, Baghdad, and then headed north to conduct Stability and Security Operations in Qayyarah West and Mosul or Al Mawsil. They returned to the U.S. in early 2004 and were re-deployed to Iraq again in the fall of 2005. During their second tour in Iraq, they were stationed in the Kirkuk province under the command of LTC Marc Hutson and CSM David Allard. The majority of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were positioned on FOB Warrior at the Kirkuk Regional Air Base while 1st Battalion and other attachments were spread out amongst FOB McHenry outside of Hawijah, FOB Caldwell just south of Kirkuk, and FOB Bernstien southwest of Kirkuk. For their third OIF deployment, the Bastogne Bulldogs were split up, with the 1st Battalion deployed near Baiji, Iraq, and the 2nd Battalion deployed in the vicinity of Samarra, Iraq. Both battalions served 15 month deployments beginning in September 2007, and ending in late November 2008.  Modularity  With the recent Army-wide reorganization adding one brigade to each division and eliminating one infantry or armor battalion from each brigade, 3-327th was inactivated and replaced by the 1st Squadron (RSTA), 32nd Cavalry Regiment. The 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) also includes the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry regiment; 2nd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment; the 426th Brigade Support Battalion; and the 326th Brigade Engineer Battalion.

It is known as the Battle of Barawala Kalay Valley. It was an operation to close down the Taliban supply route through the Barawala Kalay Valley and to remove the forces of Taliban warlord Qari Ziaur Rahman from the Barwala Kalay Valley.tune.pk The 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division would suffer 6 killed and 7 wounded during combat operations.

It was incorporated by royal charter. Strictly, it was The Company for Smelting Down Lead with Pitcoal. Origins The company was chartered in 1692 to investors who intended to acquire the lead-smelting works (reverberatory furnaces) of Talbot Clerke, the son of Sir Clement Clerke near Bristol. This apparently did not prove a success, and the company returned the works in 1695 to Talbot Clerke (by then Sir Talbot). Another group of entrepreneurs, of whom Dr Edward Wright was a leading member, obtained leases in Cumberland in 1693. This, known as Estourt's Copper or Mines Royal Copper was floated as an unincorporated company in 1693. This company, many of whose members were Quakers, is not to be confused with the Society of Mines Royal, which was by then largely moribund. It acquired lead mines in Flintshire from Lethicullier's Copper Company (another unincorporated venture) in 1695. This proved more successful. In 1704, the owners acquired the charter of the defunct The Company for Smelting Down Lead with Pitcoal, and transferred their business to it. The following year, this also took over the Ryton Company, which had reverberatory furnaces at Ryton on Tyne and lead mines on Alston Moor.P. W.

Rhodes, 'The London Lead Company in North Wales, 1692-1792' (unpublished Ph. D. thesis, Leicester University 1972). Teesdale Nenthead smelt mill in 2011 The London Lead Company started its Teesdale operations in 1753 when it took a lease on a mine at Newbiggin in Teesdale. This gradually expanded to a further 18 miles and a smelting mill at Eggleston. In 1815 the company moved its headquarters to Middleton-in-Teesdale where it built Middleton House, the impressive headquarters of the company. The Company had Quaker origins and tried to provide for its workers who suffered appalling conditions underground and working with the ore. In Middleton they built company houses (Newtown). A contemporary writer described the part of Middleton built by the Company: \\"Masterman Place or as it is sometimes called, New-Middleton, was erected in 1833 by the London Lead Company from the chaste and appropriate design of Mr. Bonomi, and under the direction of Robert Stagg. It consists of several uniform rows of neat and convenient cottages, situated in a spacious garden, a portion of which was appropriated to each dwelling. The increasing population of Middleton had considerably enhanced the rents of dwelling houses there, and it was to diminish this burden that the Company built Masterman Place, in which, as vacancies occur, they place their most deserving workmen, thus combining general utility with the reward of personal merit. The first occupiers took possession of their new abodes in May 1824, accompanied by bands of music, etc.\\" Temperance was required by the company in their new houses. By 1890 the company was starting to suffer from competition, both from other materials and imports. From 1895 onwards the Company slowly scaled down its whole mining enterprise, partly due to the age of the main members of the board, or court, but mainly due to the rapidly shrinking lead market at the time. The Company finally wound up in 1905, selling the mines to the Vieille Montagne Company who worked them for zinc up until the Second World War. Many details about Lead Mining in the NE of England are available from Killhope Mining Museum in Weardale.

Developed by Capcom, it was released on May 2, 1990, in Japan, then North America in July, and lastly Europe in 1991. The playable character Red Arremer (Firebrand in the U.S.) made his debut in the video game series Ghosts 'n Goblins as an antagonist character, of which this is a spin-off. Gargoyle's Quest was released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in Japan on June 29, 2011 and worldwide on August 25, 2011. Gargoyle's Quest was followed by the NES prequel Gargoyle's Quest II in 1992 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System sequel Demon's Crest in 1994. Plot= Storyline  According to the fictional game lore, Firebrand is a gargoyle predestined to carry on the namesake and identity of the Red Blaze ‚Äì the powerful force that fought back the Destroyers long before this game takes place. As his destiny foretold, Firebrand saves the Ghoul Realm from brutal conquest by traversing the Ghoul Realm, building his powers, and preparing to fight against the Destroyers' king, Breager, so as to ensure the protection of the Ghoul Realm once more. Characters *Firebrand (playable, main character) - a gargoyle predestined to become the Red Blaze and take down King Breager. *Red Blaze - savior of the Ghoul Realm who was a gargoyle. He defeated then locked underground the King of Destruction years before. Rushifell believes he is actually the Red Blaze until Firebrand defeats him and rightfully earns the title. =Allies= :*King Darkoan - a king of the Ghoul Realm. Usurped by King Breager and imprisoned in his own tower, unable to move from his throne. :*Barone Jark - baron of the first city on Firebrand's path; bears a striking similarity to Astaroth from Ghosts 'n Goblins. He asks Firebrand to obtain his Gremlin Stick, which was given to him by King Darkoan, by using the Fingernail of the Spectre. He can predict the future when in possession of the Gremlin Stick. :*Majorita - female historian who lives in the Cave of Darkness and tells Firebrand the legend of the Red Blaze. Possibly immortal and hundreds of years old. :*Barone Bymon - has the Candle of Darkness, which is needed to find Majorita in the Cave of Darkness. =Enemies= :*King Breager (final boss) - known as the King of Destruction. He wants to destroy the Ghoul Realm but had failed once on a previous occasion when he was stopped by the Red Blaze. He is the commander of The Destroyers, an invading army. :*Zundo Druer (first boss) - fought in the burning town. It guards the portal to the Ghoul Realm and looks like a giant blowfish who spews forth living flames. :*Four-Eyes (second boss) - this collective creature is the boss at the top of the Tower and guards the Gremlin Stick. The four eyes cling to its walls: two on one side of the room, two on the opposite. They shoot sparks from their irises. :*Bellzemos (third boss) - the demon that holds King Darkoan prisoner in Darkoan's palace. He or she is a skeletal demon that flies and can break his or her body down into beelike creatures before reconstructing somewhere else. :*Zakku Druzer (fourth boss) - he appears in the Desert of Destitution. Resembles a giant skeletal snail with two smaller demon heads below his main head; these shoot projectiles at Firebrand. He guards the Candle of Darkness. :*Rushifell (fifth boss) - a demon who believes himself to be the Red Blaze and keeper of the Eternal Candle. Once he is defeated, he gladly hands over the candle to the true Red Blaze. His name appears to be a deliberate miss-transliteration of Lucifer and is the same character as Lucifer from Ghouls 'n Ghosts (who was renamed Loki in the Genesis version). Gameplay The game consists of two gameplay styles. One half has the player traverse an overhead view, either on the world map or in towns. This is broken up by the other type of content: individual, action-platforming levels that sometimes feature a boss at the end. While traversing in the sections with an overhead view, the player is able to talk with residential ghouls and, if outside a town, is susceptible to random battle encounters. The player then must defeat the enemies in order to return to the overhead-view map. While on the overhead map, the player occasionally comes across ghouls who want to fight Firebrand for various reasons. Firebrand can walk, jump (progressively higher with time), cling to walls using his claws, hover for a period (progressively longer with time), and fire offensive projectiles. The player starts with a weak projectile with a short range, but progressively gains new projectiles. Firebrand starts with two hit points, but gains more throughout the game based on items or blessings obtained; various enemies and objects drain different amounts of his health, represented by the hit points. Throughout the game, the player gains various items including passive ones that increase Firebrand's abilities outright. Eventually, Firebrand acquires an item that allows the player to hover without ever needing to rest on the ground. A healing vial can be used to restore health. Additionally, the offensive projectiles that are learned over time each have unique traits or specialized uses. The Blockbuster, for example, is more powerful than its predecessor, travels further, and can destroy special walls blocking the player's path. Another projectile temporarily covers sharp vertical surfaces allowing Firebrand to reach higher locations. These abilities guarantee a use for such projectiles even after more powerful projectiles are obtained, and provide a depth of valid options for attacking foes. Projectiles can be selected from a drop-down, pause menu at any time, same as healing vials. Reception From contemporary reviews, GamePro magazine predicted Gargoyle's Quest to be a system seller for the Game Boy, and called it an instant hit, as well as \\"original.\\" They ended their review praising the game for its diversity of play and locales, and for its \\"detailed graphics and great music\\". Contemporary critics found the 360-degree scrolling camera to be novel and impressive for a Game Boy game. The Japanese gaming publication Famitsu gave the game a 25 out of 40 score. From retrospective reviews, Nintendo Life editor Kaes Delgrego, who gave a higher score, stated the game to be \\"[B]eautiful in its simplicity, satisfying in its depth [...], Gargoyle's Quest is almost a painful reminder of how good games used to be, and is a solid indication of [how much potential] the Game Boy had\\". He also found the music and art do an impressive job at vividly conveying the drab, macabre world, especially given that the game came out close to the start of the Game Boy's lifespan. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame gave the game four out of five stars, concluding that \\"Nice graphics and sounds, solid controls, and several new abilities (including flying and climbing) round out this ghoulishly entertaining, though undeniably challenging experience.\\" Nintendo Power commented on the Game Boy game reviewing the NES version of Gargoyle's Quest II in 1992, with the review stating that \\"the first Gargoyle's Quest as one of the most original and challenging games\\" the reviewer had seen for the Game Boy. Game Informers Ben Reeves called it the 18th best Game Boy game, noting that \\"The side-scrolling action levels posed a nice challenge, but the game‚Äôs mild RPG elements really helped set this game apart.\\"  Notes ReferencesExternal links * * Gargoyle's Quest on GameFAQs Category:1990 video games Category:Capcom franchises Category:Video games about demons Category:Game Boy games Category:Gargoyles in popular culture Category:Ghosts 'n Goblins Category:Action-adventure games Category:Side- scrolling platform games Category:Virtual Console games for Nintendo 3DS Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Harumi Fujita Category:Video games scored by Yoko Shimomura Category:Video game spin- offs ","title":"Gargoyle's Quest"},{"id":"3799556","text":"Akhil (in Devanagari: ‡§Ö‡§ñ‡§ø‡§≤) is an Indian masculine given name.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on June 15, 2003. Set in a retro-futuristic 31st century, the series follows the adventures of the employees of Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company. In this episode, Earth president Richard Nixon issues every citizen with a $300 tax rebate; with the episode following the Planet Express crew as they each spend their money. The episode was inspired by \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\", an episode of The Simpsons.Cohen, David X. (2005). Commentary for \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Plot Zapp Brannigan leads an attack on Tarantulon VI, claiming numerous silken artworks for Earth. Earth President Richard Nixon considers this a windfall, and gives every citizen a $300 tax rebate. Brannigan later invites Leela and her friends to an exhibit of the silk treasures. The Planet Express crew each contemplate how to spend their funds. Leela uses it to swim with a whale; Fry uses the money to buy and drink one hundred cups of coffee over the course of the episode, and Bender spends his on burglary tools to steal a $10,000 cigar. Bender refuses to smoke it until the exhibition. Others find their expenditures less thrilling: Professor Farnsworth uses the money to buy stem cells to give him a youthful appearance but discovers they only last temporarily, while Hermes buys a set of mechanical stilts for his son Dwight that inadvertently go haywire and drag the two off, rampaging through New New York. Kif buys a watch for his girlfriend Amy but accidentally loses it to the same whale that Leela was swimming with, though he eventually recovers it after a brief accusation of ambergris theft. Eventually, they all gather for the exhibition. Just as Bender lights up the cigar, Hermes and Dwight, still stuck on the stilts, smash through the side of the building, causing the cigar to ignite the silk artworks. At the same time, Fry finishes the hundredth cup of coffee and enters a caffeine-induced state of hyperspeed, moving much faster than anyone else. Fry easily gathers all the guests onto a trolley, wheels them into an alley behind the museum, and extinguishes the fire before the hyperspeed ends. As they all recover from what just happened, they find that Zoidberg, who had been debating on how to spend his tax rebate for something that would make him happy, opted to spend it on a nice meal for a number of hobos. The guests join them for the meal, though Bender is soon caught by the cops and beaten up for the earlier robbery. Broadcast and reception In its initial airing, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 3.6/7, placing it 79th among primetime shows for the week of June 9‚Äì15, 2003.

It is the prequel to Gargoyle's Quest (part of the Ghosts 'n Goblins franchise) and features a similar gameplay style, which combines adventure elements with side-scrolling action in a macabre fantasy setting. Gameplay The Demon Darkness utilizes a password system and is broken into two sections: Traversing the Ghoul Realm via an overhead map view, and side-scrolling action areas, that take place in dungeons, across giant pits, and more. The action portions of the gameplay are nearly identical, in a broad sense, to the previous Gargoyle's Quest game. The main difference between these parts and the original Gargoyle's Quest's action platforming segments is the addition of the Magic Tornado power-up, which allows Firebrand, the playable character, to raise himself into the air in vertical directions by standing on temporary platforms. Like is the previous game, Firebrand gets around with the added help of his wings which let him glide horizontally in mid-air. Firebrand can shoot \\"magic weapon\\" projectiles as a mean of attack or self-defense at any given moment. One of the staple abilities of Firebrand is his power to cling to walls for climbing up vertical cliffs, grabbing on to the sides of moving objects, and slower descending. Firebrand is notably slower than most video game characters of his kind, often leading to a necessary confrontation with each foe. Occasionally, Firebrand is blocked by foes that have significantly more health than regular ones and must defeat them in confined rooms to advance. In the overworld and town screens, Firebrand moves in the four cardinal directions to navigate the realm he inhabits in semi-linear paths. Towns contain ghoul denizens, who talk to Firebrand, and various stone buildings that can be entered. Firebrand becomes more powerful as he progresses, whether by increased glide time, higher jumping ability, or more stamina, through the use of acquired enchanted items. Plot According to the video game's content, a long, long time ago before humans starting appearing in the fictional place called the Ghoul Realm, there was a fictional, young ghoul warrior, a gargoyle named Firebrand from the town of Etruria. One day, while Firebrand was out partaking in his daily routine of training in a small, alternate dimension, The Black Light appeared unexpectedly and destroyed his home. When he returns from his training, he was told to hurry to the local King by another ghoul just before it collapsed and died before him. Firebrand then made his way there. After defeating Nagus (the Spaulder-wearing monster as seen in the distance on the European box art), Firebrand was able to meet with King Morock, who informed Firebrand that he, himself, was on the brink of death. Before dying, he gave Firebrand the Spectre's Fingernail and Firebrand set off on a journey to unravel the mystery of The Black Light, facing off against an invading army the whole way.Capcom. Gargoyle's Quest II. Capcom, 1992-2014. 3DS Virtual Console. Retrieved 2017-02-18. Re-releases Gargoyle's Quest II was ported to the Game Boy in 1993 in Japan & China (DMG-201 CHN) only, under the name Makaimura Gaiden: The Demon Darkness (È≠îÁïåÊùëÂ§ñ‰ºù The Demon Darkness). This port was an enhanced version of the original title containing two new action stages (a cave in the northern part of Sittem Desert and another cave in the desert where Dagon dwells). Completing these levels unlocks abilities unique to this port of the game: a homing upgrade for Firebrand's basic attack as well as an astral projection technique that can be used to briefly scout out the area around Firebrand. It was scheduled to be released in North America in July 1993 but was later canceled. The NES/Famicom version was re-released in Japan on March 5, 2014 and May 21, 2014 on the Virtual Console for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, respectively and in North America on October 30, 2014 on both the 3DS and Wii U and Europe on September 4, 2014 on the Wii U and October 30, 2014 on the 3DS. All Virtual Console versions of the game have an ESRB rating of \\"E for Everyone\\" in North America, unlike all previous versions, which were unrated.  Reception  The Japanese gaming publication Famitsu gave the game a 25 out of 40 score. It gave the Gameboy version a score of 22 out of 40. The Virtual Console versions were each given an 8/10 by Nintendo Life. No differences between the two virtual console re-releases were stated. Tim Latshaw of Nintendo Life called Gargoyle's Quest II: The Demon Darkness \\"a fine little gem from back in the day that deserves all the appreciation of players who are up to its tough but not impossible style of gameplay.\\" He deeply welcomed the virtual console's \\"restore point\\" save function as an addition to the archaic password system, going as far as to imply either of these ports were the superior ways to play the NES version of the game. IGN put the NES version at number 63 on their list of the best North American NES games ever created. As a point of reference, there are 662 NES games licensed and released in North America.

Born in Southwell in Nottinghamshire he spent the majority of his career at West Ham United but also had spells at Sheffield United and Watford. Club career He began his playing career at Atlas & Norfolk Works in Sheffield, before becoming a Sheffield United player for a fee of ¬£20. He was generally regarded as understudy to Harold Gough which limited his appearances during his time at Bramall Lane. With the outbreak of World War I he joined the Coldstream Guards but was wounded in France. On recovering he would play regularly for West Ham United as a guest player and eventually transferred to the Hammers permanently after the end of the conflict. West Ham United paid ¬£300 for his services fee and he went on to play for the club until 1932, becoming a Hammers legend. He made 456 appearances for West Ham (54 as a wartime guest), ranking him twelfth in the list of loyal servants to the club, even playing at right back for one of these games. He was part of the West Ham team that were elected to The Football League for the first time in 1919, and went on to win promotion to the First Division during the 1922‚Äì23 season. He also appeared in the famous White Horse Final, the first FA Cup final at the brand new Wembley Stadium. Ted Hufton finished his playing career with Watford, for whom he played two league matches in the 1932‚Äì33 season. International career He made his international d√©but against Belgium on 1 November 1923, the game finishing 2‚Äì2. During his second international game, on 22 October 1927 at Windsor Park, Belfast, against Ireland, Hufton broke his arm and had to leave the pitch after 40 minutes to be rushed to hospital. England's Jack Hill also had to leave the game, at half-time, due to injury. England continued the second half with only nine players and lost, 2‚Äì0. In only his third game for his country, on 28 March 1928, an England team that was packed with many big stars, including Dixie Dean, Roy Goodall and Joe Bradford was beaten at home 5‚Äì1 by Scotland. He earned his final cap as an England player on 15 May 1929 when England lost to Spain, who narrowly edged a 4‚Äì3 victory. Post football On his retirement from playing he went into the motor trade in London and after World War II returned to Upton Park to act as a press room steward on match days. He suffered with bad health in later life and following a road accident, and with failing eyesight, he moved to Swansea where he died in 1967.

Gameplay The game is essentially a series of 36 jigsaw puzzles with pentominos that must be assembled into a specific shape. The puzzles start off with rectangular shapes and simple solutions, but the puzzles quickly grow more complex, with odder shapes like a rocket ship, a gun, and even enlarged versions of some of the pentominoes themselves. Each level is timed, and once the timer is started it cannot be stopped until the level is finished. One starts off the game with only three pentomino pieces, and at the completion of each early level, a new piece is awarded to the player. At the final level, the player is given the 2x2 square O tetromino and must complete an 8x8 square puzzle. After completing each level, the player was given a password to access that level at a later time. Each password was a common English four-letter word, so that by guessing common four-letter words, players could potentially access levels they had not actually reached by playing the game. Development and ports The name of the game was inspired by Daedalus, the mythical character of Greek legend who created the labyrinth. A faithful fan version was later coded for the MSX computer system by Karoshi Corporation in 2006 for the game development contest MSXdev'06. The game has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and GP2X.

Poloxamer 407 is a triblock copolymer consisting of a central hydrophobic block of polypropylene glycol flanked by two hydrophilic blocks of polyethylene glycol (PEG). The approximate lengths of the two PEG blocks is 101 repeat units, while the approximate length of the propylene glycol block is 56 repeat units. This particular compound is also known by the BASF trade name Pluronic F-127 or by the Croda trade name Synperonic PE/F 127. Uses Most of the common uses of poloxamer 407 are related to its surfactant properties. For example, it is widely used in cosmetics for dissolving oily ingredients in water. It can also be found in multi-purpose contact lens cleaning solutions, where its purpose there is to help remove lipid films from the lens. It can also be found in some mouthwashes. There is a research ongoing for using poloxamer 407 for aligning severed blood vessels before gluing them surgically. Poloxamer 407 is used in bioprinting applications due to its unique phase-change properties. In a 30% solution by weight, poloxamer 407 forms a gel solid at room temperature but liquifies when chilled to . This allows poloxamer 407 to serve as a removable support material, particularly for creating hollow channels or cavities inside hydrogels. In this role, it is often referred to as a \\"sacrificial ink\\" or a \\"fugitive ink\\". Reports of adverse effects It was reported in The Australian newspaper 18 November 2006 that this common ingredient in toothpaste and mouthwash can cause high cholesterol in mice. A team from the Centre for Ageing and the ANZAC Research Institute in Sydney used it as a tool to demonstrate that cells in the liver behave like a sieve. They gave a high dose (1 gram per kilogram of body weight) of poloxamer 407 to mice, which blocked 80% of the pores in liver cells that absorb lipoproteins, leading to a 10-fold increase in plasma lipid levels. However, the dose used is far higher than a person would be exposed to in toothpaste or mouthwash.  Potential degradation by sonication  Wang et al. reported that aqueous solutions of poloxamer 188 and poloxamer 407 sonicated in the presence or absence of multi- walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) can become highly toxic to cultured cells. The toxicity correlated with the sonolytic degradation of the polymers.

History In 120 AD, during the Kushana Age, King Kanishka conquered the Rohat and Jaitaran areas, parts of today's Pali district. Until the end of seventh century AD this area was ruled by the Chalukya King Harshavardhana along with other parts of the present state of Rajasthan. During the period from the 10th to the 15th century, the boundaries of Pali extended to adjoining Mewar, Godwad and Marwar. Nadol was the capital of the Chauhan clan. All Rajput rulers resisted the foreign invaders but individually fought for each other's land and leadership. After the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan, against Mohammed Gauri, the Rajput power of the area was disintegrated. The Godwad area of Pali became subject to the then ruler of Mewar, Maharana Kumbha; however Pali city‚Äîwhich was ruled by Brahmin rulers with the patronage of neighbouring Rajput rulers‚Äîremained peaceful and progressive. The 16th and 17th centuries saw a number of battles in the surrounding areas of Pali. Shershah Suri was defeated by Rajput rulers in the battle of Giri near Jaitaran, Mughal emperor Akbar's army had constant battles with Maharana Pratap in the Godwad area. After the Mughals had conquered almost all of Rajputana, Veer Durga Das Rathore of Marwar made organised efforts to redeem the Marwar area from Aurangzeb, the last Mughal emperor. By then Pali had become subservient to the Rathore clan of Marwar state. Pali was rehabilitated by Maharaja Vijay Singh and soon it became an important commercial centre. During the British era in India in 1857, various Thakurs of Pali under the stewardship of the Thakur of Auwa fought against British rule. Auwa fort was surrounded by the British army and the conflict lasted many days. Geologists trace the settlement at Pali back to prehistory and maintain that Pali emerged from the vast western sea, which was spread over a large part of present-day Rajasthan. In the Vedic age, Maharshi Javali stayed in this area for meditation and interpretation of Vedas. In the Mahabharata age, the Pandavas also made this area (near Bali) their resting place during exile. As a part of ancient Arbuda Province, this area was known as Balla-Desh. Geography The Aravalli Range forms the eastern boundary of the district; the southern boundary ends at Bamnera village in Sumerpur Tehsil. A zone of foothills lies to the west, through which run the many tributaries of the Luni River. The western portion of the district includes the alluvial plain of the Luni. It is bounded by eight districts, Nagaur District to the north, Ajmer District to the northeast, Rajsamand District to the east, Udaipur District to the southeast, Sirohi District to the southwest, Jalore District and Barmer District to the west, and Jodhpur District to the northwest. The major part of the district has elevations ranging from 200 to 300 m above mean sea level, but in the east‚Äîtoward the Aravalli Range‚Äîthe elevation increases and the average is nearer 600 m and at some places the elevations exceed 1000 m.

Wells are the main sources of irrigation in the district, which constitute the source for 75% of the total irrigated area, followed by ponds tanks (20%), and tube wells (5%). In all, the district has ninety-two dams, of which three dams are broken: one each at Gajni, Potalia and Chipatia. The total catchment area of all the dams is . In 1990, the capacity of the eighty-nine dams was 20197.3 million cubic feet. There are forty-eight dams in the district, named with completion date where known: Some of the reservoirs created by these dams are used for irrigation purposes, as well as drinking water and flood control. Jawai Dam is the largest dam in western Rajasthan, which is very useful source of drinking water for the district in summer days. The biggest river in the district is the Luni and its major tributaries in the district are the Jawai, the Lilri, the Mithari, the Sukri, the Bandi and the Guhiya. ; Luni The river Luni originates near Ajmer in the western slopes of the Aravalli Range at an elevation of about 550 m. About 495 km after the flow in a south-western of Rajasthan, it disappears in the marshy land of Rann of Kutch. The total catchment area of the Luni River Basin in Rajasthan is 37,363 km¬≤, covering parts of the Districts of Ajmer, Pali, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Barmer, Jalore and Gujarat in Rajasthan 330 km and in Gujarat 20 km ; Guhiya Guhiya river originates near Khariyaniv and Tharasani villages in Pali District in the hillocks. It merges with Bandi River near Phekariya village. The catchment is about 3,835 km¬≤, which is situated in Pali district. Its tributaries are Raipur Luni, Radia Nadi, Guria Nadi, Lilri Nadi, Sukri and Phunpharia Bala. ; Khari (Hemawas) River Khari is formed by the confluence of small streams namely Somesar (origination: near Somesar village in the western slopes of the Aravali), Khari Kherwa, Umrawas Ka Nala (origination: Near Bagol Kanklawas in the western slopes of the Aravali) and Kotki Nadi (origination: Dewair Reserved Forest Bhakar, after flow of about 30 km). After joining of all these small streams, the river is called Khari. After flowing for about 25 km, it joins Bandi River downstream of Hemawas reservoir . Its catchment area is 1,232 km¬≤. ; Bandi (Hemawas) Near Bombadra pickup weir Khari and Mithari rivers join and form the Bandi River.

King's Kate Martinelli series. Concerning the search for the murderer of several young girls, it won the 1994 Edgar Award for Best First Novel. It is followed by To Play the Fool. Plot summary The strangulation of four children in the vicinity of San Francisco leads the police force to appoint inspectors Al Hawkin and Kate (\\"Casey\\") Martinelli to discover the criminal. Suspicion falls on renowned artist Vaun Adams, convicted of murdering a young girl years before. When someone attempts to murder Vaun herself, the police are forced to conclude that someone else must be behind the murders, and they discover that Vaun's ex-boyfriend, maniacally egotistical Andy Lewis, must be the perpetrator. Hawkin convinces a reluctant Kate to set the trap for Lewis in her home by letting Vaun recover there. He arrives and declares that he will kill Kate and her lover Lee and leave Vaun to take the blame. Lee alerts the police to his presence, but the sniper who kills Lewis does not do so in time to prevent him from shooting and permanently disabling her. Characters in A Grave Talent *Kate Martinelli is a member of the San Francisco Police Department. She is extremely reserved. *Lee Cooper is Kate's lover. A psychologist, she is nearly Kate's opposite in personality. At the end of the book, she is recovering from a bullet wound. *Al Hawkin is Kate's partner at work. He falls in love with one of the witnesses in their case. *Vaun Adams is a highly talented artist targeted by her psychopathic ex-boyfriend from high school. Instead of using more modern techniques, she prefers a realistic method and is thus criticized. Kate and Lee take her in while she is recovering from Lewis's first attempt to kill her. *Andy Lewis murders several girls and disposes of the bodies near Vaun Adams's house in order to frame her for the murders. When this does not work, he attempts to kill Vaun but fails. He tries again after she has temporarily moved into Kate and Lee's home. Although a police sniper eventually kills him, he does shoot Lee.

Sierra O'Reilly was born in the southeastern Mexican state of Yucat√°n, his father-in- law Santiago M√©ndez Ibarra was the governor there in 1847, in the middle of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (in which the state of Yucat√°n declared its neutrality) and at the outbreak of the Caste War of Yucat√°n. In September of that year, he went to the United States as a negotiator on behalf of his father-in-law's government, to request U.S. military aid against the Maya rebels (who seemed, at that moment, poised to take over the peninsula), and to offer the possibility of U.S. annexation of Yucat√°n in exchange. His attempts at diplomacy on behalf of the quasi-independent peninsula went nowhere, and by the time he returned home in 1848, Mexico had lost the northern half of its territory to the U.S. but had also solved its differences with Yucat√°n, and Sierra O'Reilly found himself with an unemployed father-in-law and no government position for himself. It was then, at the age of 34, that he turned to literature. The chapters of his popular melodramatic novel, La Hija del Jud√≠o, a historical novel in the style of Sir Walter Scott about the star- crossed love of the daughter of a Jewish merchant in colonial Mexico, were published in installments in El F√©nix, a newspaper that he founded in Campeche. Published years later in book form, the novel sold well all over Latin America. His other works include the pirate novel El Filibustero, the travel journal Impresiones de un viaje a los Estados Unidos de Am√©rica y al Canad√° (1851), and numerous writings on the regional history of Yucat√°n such as Teogon√≠a de los antiguos indios and Importancia de un Museo de Antig√ºedades, as well as Spanish translations of John Lloyd Stephens's works on Yucat√°n.

An updated version of the 132, called the Argenta, was produced from 1981 to 1985. Fiat 132 (1972‚Äì74) Fiat 132 (1972 - 1974) The 132 was introduced as a replacement for the Fiat 125 and like it, came with twin overhead cam (TC) engines as standard. However, the Fiat 132 looked more like the larger top-of-the-range Fiat 130. Like the 125, the 132 came with a five speed gear box, optional in some markets and standard in others: this was still a relatively unusual feature in this class of car in 1977. GM \\"Strasbourg\\" automatic transmission was listed as an option. Fiat 132 (1974‚Äì77) A major update to the front suspension was implemented for January 1974 in response to criticism of the handling and very low geared steering. Press reports of the time commend the improved handling which was also supported by the fitting of wider tires, although poor fuel consumption at high speed continued to draw adverse comment, even where the (unusual for the time) five speed transmission option was specified. In the same year an external redesign gave the impression of a lowered waistline resulting from larger side windows. It included a reshaped C-pillar which had a semblance of BMW's \\"Hofmeister kink\\" and reminded some of the recently introduced BMW 5 Series. For the driver, new shock absorbers accompanied the suspension improvements. The 1600 cc engine remained unchanged but the 1800 cc engine benefited from a modified cylinder head and carburettor resulting in a small increase in claimed output to , along with a usefully flattened torque curve. Interior improvements included a redesigned steering wheel along with improved heating and ventilation controls. Fiat 132 (1977‚Äì81) Fiat 132 (1980) In April 1977, the 132 received a further facelift. New plastic \\"safety\\" bumpers were introduced to the model, and the gearing of the steering was raised, supported by the addition of servo-assistance. Inside were a new dashboard and seat trims. At this point, with the 130 having been discontinued, the 132 became the \\"flagship\\" of the Fiat range. It was available with seven different engines: *1.6 litre petrol producing 1592 cc (later 1585 cc after 1977) *1.8 litre petrol with 1756 cc (1972‚Äì74) *1.8 litre petrol with 1756 cc (1974‚Äì77) *2.0 litre petrol 1995 cc (from 1977) *2.0 litre petrol with fuel injection producing 1995 cc (from 1977) *2.0 litre diesel with 1995 cc *2.5 litre diesel with 2445 cc Overseas assembly The 132 had limited manufacture outside Italy compared to the smaller 124. The car was built in Spain by SEAT with a version that was sold between 1973 and 1982. It was also assembled in South Africa by Fiat's local assemblers in Rosslyn. After the 1977 update, the 132 was renamed \\"Elita\\" in South Africa, and due to a shortage of capacity at Fiat's plant it was assembled by competitors Alfa Romeo South Africa. 132 was also assembled in Yugoslavia, by Zastava in Zagreb. Cars arrived there practically fully completed, and there parts like wheels, battery, and also a plate which confirmed that car was assembled in Yugoslavia (under the name \\"Zastava 132\\"), were put. There weren't any differences than Italian-built model. Assembly lasted from 1974. to 1981. and some 2‚Äì3,000 examples were built. It was particularly popular between directors and officials. 132 was succeeded by Fiat Argenta in Zastava's lineup. In Poland the 132 was offered from 1973 as the Polski Fiat 132p. The car was described as \\"assembled by FSO\\", though actually the cars were shipped from Italy almost complete.Podbielski, Zdzis≈Çaw (2019). Samochody monta≈ºowe z ≈ªerania, \\"Auto ≈öwiat Classic\\" Nr 4/2019, p. 132-137 (Polish) FSO only did the final assembly, fitting minor parts like wipers, batteries, seats, wheels and logos. The Polski Fiat 132p was a favourite with high state officials and security services. For internal market it was available only for hard currency in Pewex stores. Until 1981, 4461 were assembled. 270 Argentas were also assembled in this way in 1985 by FSO. Kia built 4,759 units of the 132 from CKD kits in 1979 in South Korea.

Based in Liverpool, he operated blockade runners and commerce raiders that provided the Confederacy with its only source of hard currency. Bulloch arranged for the unofficial purchase by Britain of Confederate cotton, and the dispatch of armaments and other war supplies to the South. His secret service funds are alleged to have been used for the planning of Lincoln's assassination. Bulloch's half-sister Martha was the mother of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and grandmother of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.  Birth and early years  James D. Bulloch was born in 1823 on his family's plantation near Savannah, Georgia, to Major James Stephens Bulloch (son of Captain James Bulloch and Ann Irvine) and Hester Amarintha Elliot (daughter of Senator John Elliott and Esther Dunwoody). After Hester died, Major Bulloch enrolled his son in a private school in Hartford, Connecticut. The elder Bulloch married again, to the widow Martha Stewart, in May 1832. She had been the second wife and widow of Senator John Elliott. James S. and Martha Bulloch had four children: Anna; Martha \\"Mittie\\"; Charles Irvine (who died young); and Irvine Stephens Bulloch. In 1838, Major Bulloch moved his family from the Low Country to Cobb County, in the Piedmont. There he became a partner with Roswell King in a new cotton mill. In what would become Roswell, Georgia, he had a grand home built, made by the labor of free craftsmen and slave artisans. When it was completed in 1839, the family moved into Bulloch Hall. James S. Bulloch kept a large amount of land in cotton cultivation. He died in 1849; Mrs. Bulloch still held 31 enslaved African-Americans in 1850, according to the census slave schedules. Marriage and family James Dunwoody Bulloch married Elizabeth Caskie in 1851. After her early death, he married Mrs. Hariott Cross Foster, a widow, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana,James Morris Morgan, Recollections of a Rebel Reefer, Boston; New York: Houghton Mifflin Company; Cambridge: Riverside Press, 1917, full text online at Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina in 1857. They had five children together.  Naval service and European agent of Confederacy  James (left) with his younger half-brother, Irvine Bulloch, c. 1865 Bulloch served in the United States Navy for about 15 years before resigning his commission in 1854 to join a private shipping company. When the Southern states seceded from the Union and the Civil War began in 1861, one of the first acts on the part of the Union was to begin a naval blockade on the Confederacy to cut off commerce. In April 1861, while his ship was in New Orleans, Bulloch offered to assist the Confederate States of America. When he returned to New York, he found a letter from C.S.A. Attorney General Judah P. Benjamin accepting his offer and ordering him to Montgomery, Alabama, for his assignment. James D. Bulloch soon became a Confederate secret agent and their \\"most dangerous man\\" in Europe, according to Union State Department officials.Wilson, Walter E. and Gary L. McKay. James D. Bulloch; Secret Agent and Mastermind of the Confederate Navy. (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2012). Former offices of Fraser, Trenholm & Co. in Rumford Place, Liverpool (photographed in 2019).Less than two months after the attack on Fort Sumter, Bulloch arrived at Liverpool, England, and established a base of operations there. Britain was officially neutral in the conflict between North and South, but private and public sentiment favored the Confederacy. Britain was also willing to buy all the cotton that could be smuggled past the Union blockade, which provided the South with its only real source of revenue. Bulloch established a relationship with the shipping firm of Fraser, Trenholm, & Company to buy and sell Confederate cotton; Fraser and Trenholm became, in effect, the Confederacy's international bankers. George Trenholm served as Treasurer of the Confederacy in the last year of the war. Bulloch arranged for the construction and secret purchase of the commerce raider CSS Alabama. He arranged for cotton to be converted to hard currency, which he in turn used to purchase war materiel - including arms and ammunition, uniforms, and naval supplies. He also arranged for the construction of the CSS Florida; with the Alabama, these two ships preyed upon the Union's merchant fleet. James' younger half-brother, Irvine S. Bulloch, served in the Confederate States Navy on the CSS Alabama. Realizing that he needed a steady flow of funds to support the purchasing program and needing a way to ship materiel from England, Bulloch decided to buy a steamship (the SS Fingal, which was renamed the CSS Atlanta). He filled it the ordnance which he and an agent of the Southern War Department had accumulated, and sailed to America. Bulloch later returned to Liverpool and continued his business relationship with Fraser, Trenholm & Co. He was involved in constructing and acquiring a number of other warships and blockade runners for the Confederacy, including purchase of the Sea King, which was renamed the CSS Shenandoah. Bulloch instructed C.S.N. Captain James Iredell Waddell to sail \\"into the seas and among the islands frequented by the great American whaling fleet, a source of abundant wealth to our enemies and a nursery for their seamen. It is hoped that you may be able to greatly damage and disperse that fleet.\\" \\"Last of the Rebel Raiders\\", American Heritage magazine, December 1958 The CSS Shenandoah fired the last shots of the war on 28 June 1865, during a raid on American whalers in the Bering Sea.  Possible connection to Lincoln assassination plot  From his base in Great Britain, James D. Bulloch was the financier of covert Confederate naval operations within the British Empire. This aspect of his intelligence operations has eluded the many analysts and historians who have studied the Canadian elements of the conspiracy to assassinate President Lincoln. In late 1864, the Confederate States Secretary of the Navy, Stephen Mallory, ordered Bulloch to write a check drawn on \\"secret funds\\" to Patrick Martin, a Confederate blockade runner operating from Canada. These funds were intended to support the plot to kidnap Abraham Lincoln. Martin's project later evolved into the successful assassination plot. Captain Martin and his ship were lost in a storm in December 1864, as he was en route to Maryland with supplies for John Wilkes Booth. When John Surratt, the last surviving member of the Lincoln assassination conspiracy, arrived in Liverpool in 1865, there is no evidence he contacted Bulloch. The latter was keeping a very low profile.Wilson, Walter E. and Gary L. McKay. James D. Bulloch; Secret Agent and Mastermind of the Confederate Navy. (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2012).  Writes memoir, teaches Roosevelt naval warfare  As C.S.A. secret agents, James and Irvine Bulloch were not included in the general amnesty that the federal government approved after the Civil War. They decided to stay in Liverpool, where they became cotton importers and brokers; they were quite successful. During the 1880s, Theodore Roosevelt, known as T.R., persuaded his \\"Uncle Jimmie\\" Bulloch to write and publish an account of his activities during the Civil War. The Secret Service of the Confederate States in Europe was published in two volumes published in 1883. T.R. wrote to his mother telling of his success with the project saying, \\"I have persuaded him [James Bulloch] to publish a work which only he possesses the materials to write.\\"McCullough biography, footnote on page 76 In return, Uncle Jimmie spent considerable time schooling his energetic nephew on the operations of wind- powered ships in the Age of Sail and explained much about ship-to-ship fighting tactics, as Theodore had no personal experience or training in early 19th-century naval warfare. Roosevelt drew from this tutoring, and his long hours spent in libraries researching the official records of the U.S. Navy, for his book The Naval War of 1812.  Theodore Roosevelt on the Bullochs  In 1905, the height of reconciliation between the North and the South,David W. Blight, Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, Belknap Press, revised 2002 incumbent President Theodore Roosevelt toured the South. After spending October 19 in North Carolina, and skipping South Carolina, Roosevelt visited Roswell, Georgia the next day. He spoke to the citizens as his \\"neighbors and friends\\" and concluded his remarks as follows: In Roosevelt's autobiography, he mentions his Bulloch uncles as follows:  Later years  James died in Liverpool at the home of his daughter and son-in-law at 76 Canning Street, Canning, Liverpool, England in 1901 at the age of 77.

The technique involves the intrusion of a non-wetting liquid (often mercury) at high pressure into a material through the use of a porosimeter. The pore size can be determined based on the external pressure needed to force the liquid into a pore against the opposing force of the liquid's surface tension. A force balance equation known as Washburn's equation for the above material having cylindrical pores is given as: :P_L - P_G = -\\\\frac{4 \\\\sigma \\\\cos \\\\theta}{D_P} :P_{L} = pressure of liquid :P_{G} = pressure of gas :\\\\sigma = surface tension of liquid :\\\\theta = contact angle of intrusion liquid :D_{P} = pore diameter Since the technique is usually performed within a vacuum, the initial gas pressure is zero. The contact angle of mercury with most solids is between 135¬∞ and 142¬∞, so an average of 140¬∞ can be taken without much error. The surface tension of mercury at 20 ¬∞C under vacuum is 480 mN/m. With the various substitutions, the equation becomes: :D_P = \\\\frac{1470 \\\\ \\\\text{kPa}}{P_L \\\\cdot \\\\mu \\\\text{m}} As pressure increases, so does the cumulative pore volume. From the cumulative pore volume, one can find the pressure and pore diameter where 50% of the total volume has been added to give the median pore diameter.

Scale RC USS Missouri Battleship A radio-controlled boat is a boat controlled remotely with radio control equipment.  Type = Fun sport  Electric sport boats are the most common type of boat amongst casual hobbyists. Hobby-quality boat speed generally start at around 20 mph and go up from there, and can be just as fast or faster than their internal-combustion counterparts, with the latest in lithium polymer and brushless motor technology. Ready-to-run speedboats from AquaCraft, ProBoat and OffshoreElectrics can reach speeds over 40 mph out of the box and with modifications can reach well into the 50-60 mph range. These types of boats are referred to as \\"hobby grade\\" and can be found only at hobby shops and retailers. \\"Toy grade\\" boats which are obtained through mass consumer retailers, are generally much slower and their maximum speeds are usually less than 15 mph.  Scale  Large scale model warships in San Diego Scale boats are replicas of full-size boats. They are to scale of the full sized ones. They can be small enough to fit into your hand, or large, trailer-transported models weighing hundreds of pounds. More often than not they are a miniaturized version of a prototype, built using plans and/or photos, although there are variants that utilize freelance designs. An offshoot of this style of marine RC's is radio-controlled submarines.  Sailboats  Sailboats use the power of the wind acting on sails to propel the boat. Model sailboats are typically controlled via a multi-channel radio transmitter in the hands of the operator with a corresponding receiver in the boat. By changing the position of the two joysticks on the transmitter signals are sent over two separate channels on a single radio frequency (assigned to the individual boat/operator). On the boat, the radio receiver is connected to two battery- powered electric motors or servos. Signals from the radio transmitter are interpreted by the radio receiver and translated into instructions to change the position of the servos. One servo controls the position of both main and jib sails together (allowing the sails to be trimmed), the other the position of the rudder (allowing the boat to be steered).  Racing sailboats  The racing of radio-controlled yacht racing is governed by the same International Sailing Federation - Racing Rules of Sailing that are used for full-sized crewed sailing boats (with the inclusion of Appendix E, that introduces special rules to govern the radio-controlled sport). Vane controlled boats sail under their own rules. There are four international classes of radio sailing boats recognized by the International Radio Sailing Association (IRSA) who are recoignised by the International Sailing Federation are: (from smallest to largest). * International One Metre (IOM) The IOM class rules specify a monohull of maximum length 1000 mm, with maximum draught 420 mm. There is a minimum weight of 4000 g, which makes homebuilding of competitive boats possible. The IOM has three one-design rigs. To keep costs down, hull materials are restricted to either wood or glassfiber, while masts and booms are restricted to either aluminium or wood. (International One Metre Class Association) * International Marblehead A Marblehead has a maximum length of 1290 mm and a maximum draught of ca 700 mm, but no minimum displacement. Up to six rigs are allowed, the tallest being about 2200 mm. * International Ten Rater * International A Class (A), the largest of the international radio sailing classes. Other classes of international significance include the CR-914 the RC Laser, the Micro Magic, and the RG-65. The Bottle Boat is a low- cost alternative to these classes. Largely constructed from waste items (bin bags for sails and soft drink bottles for the body), it represents an environmentally friendly entry to the sport.  Racing power boats  There are dozens of types and classes of race boats. They are mainly organised by engine type and hull type. Race: Circuit and Straight line is established at National and International levels Engine: Electric, Glow Plug, Flash Steam and Gas (petrol) Hull: Mono, Hydro, Cat, Outrigger and Eco (self righting jelly mold shape) Classes are further divided by battery type and count, Engine CC, Deep V Mono, Stepped Mono, sub surface and surface piercing prop's etc. Power boats are typically Fast electric or internal combustion, (ignition engine or glow plug R/C engine based) and some are steam powered (conventional type, and also flash steam). (At one time some boats used engines working on the compression ignition principle. These were not diesels in the true sense of the word but the modelling fraternity frequently referred to them as such. A few enthusiasts still operate such engines.) The power is commonly used to rotate a submerged propeller, aircraft propeller or jet which in turn provide the thrust to move the craft. Typically power boats have two controls, rudder, outboard motor or stern drive and throttle control. Powered scale boats will often have additional remote-controlled functions to improve realism, e.g. sounding fog horns, rotating radar antennae etc. Some of the more sophisticated powered racing boats may also have additional remote-controlled functions. These may include remote mixture control allowing the driver to optimise the fuel/air mixture during a race. Another function occasionally implemented for racing boats using a surface piercing propellor is remote control of depth or angle of thrust. There are three main types of power boat. RTR(ready-to-run), ARTR(almost-ready-to-run), and kit versions are available. All thoroughbred racing boats are made from kits and the builders add their own gear and radio. Radio-controlled racing boats are designed for maximum speed and maneuverability. Various styles of racing include circuits of different shapes laid out on the water with buoys. The most common courses are the 1/6-mile oval that consists of 330-foot straight sections followed by 70-foot-diameter turns. The International Model Power Boat Association (IMPBA), North American Model Boat Association (NAMBA) and Offshore Model Racing Association (OMRA) have specific rules and regulations to address the course, race rules, and formats. In addition to oval racing there are straightaway (SAW) racing. This is a contest to see how fast you can make the boat go in a straight line. Timed events are held where the boats need to go through a starting light and an ending light. The speed is calculated by the timed difference from start to stop vs the length between the lights. Again IMPBA and NAMBA rules apply. Some enthusiasts race in the sea, controlling their craft from a pursuing boat known as a \\"chase boat\\". These courses will usually be a few miles long and the competition is judged against the clock to find the fastest in class. Within the various styles of racing there will be a number of classes depending upon engine size and type. Ocean and river going boats tend to be powered by internal combustion engines. Sprint Type races and electric races are usually held on calmer lake waters. Electric boats for racing are capable of reaching speeds of more than 50 mph and run times of around 10 minutes. Electric boats also hold the 100-yard sprint record against rival internal combustion powerplants since 2000. Tethered racing and free- running craft were popular prior to the advent of cheap radio control. The speeds of tethered racing vehicles are higher than 160 mph for boats and 230 mph for cars, but these craft bear little resemblance to real-world vehicles, and could not obtain anywhere near those speeds if converted to radio control.  Combat  IJN Kagero stern damage A competitive offshoot of the radio control model warships hobby that involves the firing of projectiles, usually propelled by gas, at opposing ships to sink or damage them. Models are usually simplified to facilitate repair. Ships are fitted with bilge pumps; bb, 3/16\\", 7/32\\" or 1/4\\" weapons that fire ball bearings. The ship's hull plating is balsa to keep the force required to penetrate down to safe levels, by Rules, they are designed to be sinkable and in fact they do on a regular basis.  Tugboats  2005 Bellevue,WA Regatta, Gary King's Tiger Sun in the starting dock. Scale model tug boats are often built to include scale drive systems. They use standard propellers and rudder(s), Becker rudders, Kort nozzles, steerable kort nozzles, Z-drives or Voith-Schneider cycloidial drives. Clubs will often host maneuvering competitions where participants are tasked to run their boats in the most realistic manner possible. This can be judged with or without a \\"tow\\" or barge attached. Model Tug boats were often used for filming on three shows.

He played for many of the greatest teams of the deadball era. Born in Findlay, Ohio, he died at age 90 in Buffalo, New York. Career Johnson began his career as a shortstop with the semipro Findlay Sluggers in 1893. The following year he earned his nickname \\"Home Run\\" by hitting 60 home runs. In 1895, he and Bud Fowler formed the Page Fence Giants in Adrian, Michigan. Johnson was the shortstop and the team's captain. After 1898 the Page Fence Giants were unable to continue playing, so Johnson and most of the other players moved to Chicago where they played for the Chicago Columbia Giants in 1899. The next season, he played with the Chicago Unions, where he teamed with Bill Monroe and Mike Moore. Johnson returned to the Columbia Giants for 1901 and 1902. In 1903 and 1904 Johnson played for the Cuban X-Giants and captained the team to the colored championship in 1903, defeating the Philadelphia Giants for the honor. His teammates included Rube Foster and Charlie Grant. The 1905 Philadelphia Giants He joined the Philadelphia Giants in 1905. Findlay, Ohio's celebrated contribution to African-American baseball history turned 33 years old late that season. His hitting and pitching electrified his new team. The unselfish qualities of Johnson's power-packed swing helped him to lead the team in categories as hit-by pitches, sacrifice hits and, of course, home runs with twelve. An honorable man of exemplary character, he hustled out ground balls and seldom disputed an umpire's questionable call. It was equally rare for him to strike out. In one reflective moment Johnson told a reporter, \\"when I did [strike out] I surprised myself.\\" Slowed by an injury that occurred early in the season, he missed thirteen days of play. Johnson was rushed back into the team's starting line-up, and as a consequence his home run totals slumped dramatically. He also was used as an occasional starting pitcher. A submarine pitcher of exceptional ability, he was essentially the Philadelphia Giants' fourth starter in 1905. His gutsy mound appearances continually kept everyone questioning why he did not pitch more often. In 1906 he moved to the Brooklyn Royal Giants, where he was again captain, and led the team to championships in 1908 and 1909. Sportswriter Harry Daniels named Captain Grant Johnson to his 1909 \\"All-American Team\\" saying he \\"always has been a hard, consistent hitter, fielder, and base runner, and a great handler.\\"\\"The Base Ball Spirit In The East.\\" Indianapolis Freeman, Indianapolis, Indiana, Saturday, December 25, 1909, Page 7, Columns 1 and 2 In 1910 Johnson signed with Rube Foster's Leland Giants and hit .397. Around this time he began to be known by the nickname of \\"Dad\\" Johnson as well as his old nickname, \\"Home Run Johnson.\\" From 1911 to 1913 Johnson played with the New York Lincoln Giants, hitting .374, .413, and .371. In 1913 the Lincoln Giants won the eastern title and beat the Chicago American Giants in the championship playoff. Later he played with the Pittsburgh Colored Stars of Buffalo and managed the Buffalo Giants. Johnson continued to play with lesser teams until finally retiring in 1932 at the age of 58. After retiring from baseball he lived in Buffalo, where he worked for the New York Central Railroad Company. He was buried in Lakeside Cemetery (formerly Lakeside Memorial Park Cemetery and Buffalo Rural Cemetery) in Hamburg, New York on September 14, 1963. References *Dixon, Phil S.

At the end of the 2011 season, Diehl and the Giants appeared in Super Bowl XLVI. He started in the game as the Giants defeated the New England Patriots by a score of 21‚Äì17. On August 21, 2013, the New York Giants announced that Diehl will undergo surgery to repair his injured right thumb. The recovery time was expected to be approximately six weeks. On January 24, 2014, Diehl announced his retirement after 11 seasons. Broadcasting On August 6, 2014, it was announced Diehl had been hired to work as a color analyst for NFL games on Fox. He teamed with Thom Brennaman as the number #4 team on these telecasts for 2014. During the 2015 season, Diehl worked fewer regular season games because former lead college football on Fox analyst Charles Davis took his place alongside Brennaman. (It was supposed to be Donovan McNabb, but he was arrested for a DUI in July 2015, leading Fox to make this change. Joel Klatt replaced Davis on college football telecasts with Davis's former partner, Gus Johnson). Diehl would move two spots down to the number #6 team to team with Dick Stockton and replacing Stockton's former partners Brady Quinn, Kirk Morrison, and McNabb. For the 2016 and 2017 seasons, Diehl moved down to the #7 crew, where he was teamed with Sam Rosen. In 2017, Diehl joined CBS Sports Network as an college football analyst. Personal life Diehl during the Giants Super Bowl XLII rally at Giants stadium. Diehl is of mixed German and Croatian descent. His Croat origins are from his maternal grandparents. His grandmother, Lucija Semanic (born ≈†amaniƒá) was born in the USA, but was from the town of Krk in the southwestern part of the island Krk in Croatia, while his grandfather, Ante Bekavac, emigrated to United States from Lovreƒá in Croatia. He has a tattoo of the Croatian coat of arms on his left arm. Diehl stated his favorite tattoo is his Croatian coat of arms. He visited Croatia in June and July 2011, in search of his roots. Diehl played at the University of Illinois, and is a fan of the university's former symbol, Chief Illiniwek. During player introductions on TV, he states his school as \\"University of Chief Illiniwek.\\" He also has an image of Chief Illiniwek tattooed on his arm. Diehl received the Wellington Mara NFL Man of the Year Award May 22, 2012, at the annual Boys Hope Girls Hope Dinner.

The meaning of the name, which has the further spelling variants of Taenso, Tinsas, Tenza or Tinza, Tahensa or Takensa, and Tenisaw, is unknown. It is believed to be an autonym. The Taensa should not be confused with the Avoyel (or Avoyelles), known by the French as the petits Taensas (English: Little Taensa), who were mentioned in writings by explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in 1699. The Taensa are more closely related to the Natchez people and both are considered descendants of the late prehistoric Plaquemine culture. The Taensa migrated as a result of Chickasaw and Yazoo hostilities, first lower down the Mississippi River. In 1715, protected by the French, they migrated to lands near the now eponymously named Tensas River near Mobile, Alabama. When the French ceded Mobile and their other territory east of the Mississippi River to the English in 1763, following their defeat in the Seven Years' War, the Taensa and other small tribes returned to Louisiana, settling near the Red River. They numbered about 100 persons in 1805. They later moved south to Bayou Boeuf and later still to Grand Lake, \\"after which the remnant disappear[ed] from history.\\" History=Prehistory Geographic extent of the Plaquemine culture and some of its major sites in the Lower Mississippi River valley The Taensa and the closely related Natchez are descendants of the late prehistoric Plaquemine culture (1200-1700 CE). The Plaquemine culture was a Mississippian culture variant centered on the Lower Mississippi River valley. They had complex political and religious institutions and lived in large villages centered on ceremonial platform mounds. They were primarily agriculturists who grew maize, pumpkins, squash, beans and tobacco. They had a deep history in the area stretching back through the earlier Coles Creek (700-1200 CE) and Troyville cultures (400-700 CE) to the Marksville culture (100 BCE to 400 CE), which was contemporaneous with the Hopewell cultures of present-day Ohio and Illinois. The Tensas Basin region where their villages were found has several Coles Creek and Plaquemine era ceremonial sites with platform mounds located very nearby, including the Coles Creek era Balmoral Mounds (occupied circa 700 and 1200 CE), and the Plaquemine era Routh Mounds (occupied circa 1200 to 1350 CE) and Flowery Mound (occupied circa 1200‚Äì1541) sites. . Protohistory de Soto route through the Southeast The post- Hernando de Soto entrada Transylvania Phase (1550-1700 CE) of the Tensas Basin saw the increasing spread of Mississippian influences diffusing southward from Arkansas and northwestern Mississippi. The Jordan Mounds site on a relict channel of the Arkansas River in northeastern Louisianas Morehouse Parish was constructed during the protohistoric period between 1540 and 1685. The builders were an intrusive group in the area, Mississippianized peoples who were possibly refugees from the Mississippi River area to the east and were escaping the collapse of their society brought about by the aftereffects of European contact. By the late 1600s the site was abandoned. Historians and archaeologists such as Marvin Jeter have theorized that the Plaquemine \\"Northern Natchezan\\" ancestors of the Taensa were in part some of the peoples documented in the early 1540s by the de Soto expedition in southeastern Arkansas and northwestern Mississippi. After the disastrous encounter and subsequent population crash due to the introduction of European diseases and political upheaval left in de Soto's wake, remnant populations of Northern Natchezans migrated down the Mississippi toward their Southern Natchezan cousins. European contact La Salle with the Taensa, by artist George Catlin circa 1847 The first securely documented European contact with the Taensa was by the French La Salle expedition of 1682. They were described as having a village on Lake St. Joseph, a narrow crescent shaped oxbow lake located west of the Mississippi, between the Yazoo River and Saint Catherine Creek (near Newellton in modern Tensas Parish, Louisiana). La Salles associate Henri de Tonti visited the Taensa again in 1686 and 1690. They numbered approximately 1,200 people scattered throughout seven or eight villages on the western end of the lake and another on the Tensas River near present-day Clayton in Concordia Parish. In 1698 French Catholic missionary priests Antoine Davion and Fran√ßois de Montigny and J. B. La Source (a lay person and possible servant to the priests) visited the Taensa; de Montigny founded a short-lived mission among them. De Montigny at that time records their population as being 700 people. In 1699 French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville recorded the Taensa as having 300 warriors and living in seven villages named as Taensas, Chaoucoula, Conchayon, Couthaougoula, Nyhougoula, Ohytoucoulas, and Talaspa. The majority of these names are in the Muskogean Mobilian trade language and not the Natchezan Taensa language. During his time with the Taensa, de Montigny prevented them from performing acts of ritual human sacrifice as part of the funeral rites for a deceased chief. Because of this, the Taensa later blamed de Montigny when lightning struck their wattle and daub temple and burned it down. He left to join the Natchez in 1790, and his mission to the Taensa was taken over by Jean-Fran√ßois Buisson de Saint- Cosme. Along with other native peoples of the lower Mississippi River, the Taensa were subject to slave raids and epidemics of European diseases such as smallpox during this time period. As the population of the Taensa steadily decreased, de Saint-Cosme in 1700 endeavored in vain to have them join with the much larger Natchez and consolidate the two missions. De Saint-Cosme settled among the Taensa and the Natchez for less than a year before leaving. Later history Period map showing the location of the Taensa, Natchez, Tunica, Yazoo, and Bayougoula The English and French colonies in the American southeast struggled for domination. The English colony of South Carolina had established a large trading network among the southeastern Native Americans, which by 1700 stretched west as far as the Mississippi River. The Chickasaw, who lived north of the Taensa and Natchez, were regularly visited by English traders and were well supplied with English trade goods and firearms. Their most lucrative trade with the English was in furs and Indian slaves. For decades the Chickasaw conducted slave raids over a wide region, and were often joined by Natchez and Yazoo warriors to attack and enslave members of smaller tribes like the Taensa. In 1706, fearing a slavers raid by a combined force of Chickasaw and Yazoo, the Taensa abandoned their village on Lake St. Joseph. They headed south to seek shelter with the Bayogoula at their village on the western bank of the Mississippi, roughly south of present-day Baton Rouge. Conflicts soon developed, and the Taensa attacked and nearly exterminated the Bayogoula peoples and burned their village down‚Äîan act described as treacherous by later historians. Though their initial relations with the Europeans had been friendly, the rivalry of the European powers strained native populations throughout the region. The Taensa ultimately migrated in 1715, under the protection of the French, to lands near modern Mobile on an eastern branch of the Mobile River north of Mobile Bay that was subsequently named for them as the Tensaw River. In 1763 the French ceded the eastern half of French Louisiana to the British following their defeat in the Seven Years' War.\\" (‚Ä¶) it is agreed, that ‚Ä¶ the confines between the dominions of his Britannick Majesty and those of his Most Christian Majesty, in that part of the world, shall be fixed irrevocably by a line drawn along the middle of the River Mississippi, from its source to the river Iberville, and from hence, by a line drawn along the middle of this river, and the lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the sea; and for this purpose, the Most Christian King cedes in full right, and guaranties to his Britannick Majesty the river and port of Mobile, and every thing which he possesses, or ought to possess, on the left side of the river Mississippi, except the town of New Orleans and the island in which it is situated, which shall remain to France, (‚Ä¶)\\"‚Äî Article VII of the alt= Treaty of Paris (1763) at Wikisource Rather than live under British rule, the Taensa/Tensaw again relocated, along with the Apalachee and Pakana, this time west of the Mississippi to French territory on the Red River. There they eventually merged with the Chitimacha . According to historian James Mooney, they numbered about 100 persons in 1805. Early in the nineteenth century, the Taensa petitioned the Spanish for land on which to settle in southeastern Texas; they were given permission to settle land lying between the Trinity and the Sabine rivers, but ultimately did not migrate. This was the last appearance of the tribe in historical records. They later moved south to Bayou Boeuf and later still to Grand Lake, \\"after which the remnant disappear[ed] from history.\\" Culture du Pratz The Taensa were a Natchezan people who separated from the main body of the Natchez sometime prior to European contact with the Lower Mississippi Valley region. As such their languages, political, religious, and material cultures were very similar to the Natchez. When they first enter the historical record they are found just to the northwest of the Natchez and on the western bank of the Mississippi as opposed to its eastern bank. Like some other inhabitants of the area, such as the Natchez, Tunica, and Houma, Taensa society was matrilineal. Taensa society was also very hierarchical and showed marked class differences between commoners and elites, hallmarks of being a simple chiefdom. Chiefs exercised absolute power and were treated with great respect; unlike more egalitarian customs among the northern tribes the early chroniclers were used to. An example of this respect was recorded during a ceremonial visit by a chief to visit the explorer Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, when attendants came several hours in advance of the chief and with their hands swept the road clean. Ceramics Pottery showing engraved Plaquemine designs from the Grand Village of the Natchez Site. The beginning of the Transylvania Phase (1550-1700 CE) of the Tensas Basin region saw the increasing spread of Mississippian influences diffusing southward from what is now southeastern Arkansas. This is most identifiable in ceramic traditions. The Mississippian peoples of the Central Mississippi Valley used different vessel forms, tempering agents, and decorations than the Plaquemine peoples of the Lower Mississippi Valley. By the late 17th century these changes in ceramic technology had reached the Taensa in the Lower Tensas Basin. The pottery of the Taensa was made with typical Mississippian culture pottery shapes and used the Mississippian hallmark of crushed mussel shell as a tempering agent, but was still being engraved with decorative designs typical of the Plaquemine area. Pottery from the Natchez sites of nearby western Mississippi still used the traditional Plaquemine grog tempering and decorative designs. On this basis the Taensa are considered to be the last Mississippian culture group to inhabit the Tensas River valley of Louisiana. Architecture The Proto-Natchezan Anna Site (1200-1500 CE) showing the temple mound and plaza arrangement of Plaquemine sites The Taensa were sedentary maize growing agriculturalists as opposed to hunter gatherers and lived in permanent villages with wattle and daub buildings. These structures were up to in length and in height and made from logs plastered in clay with roofs of woven split cane matting. Their village on Lake St Joseph is described as fitting the same dispersed hamlet pattern of the Natchez. It stretched for on the western lake shore with neighborhoods being interspersed with fields and forest. The main precinct had a log palisade, inside of which was the chiefs residence, the temple, and eight other structures. Like other Native Americans in the southeast it also had an open plaza area used for public rituals and functions such as the Green Corn Ceremony and games such as chunkey and the ballgame. This pattern of plazas flanked by mounds with temples, elite residences and mortuary structures at their summits was inherited from their Plaquemine and Coles Creek ancestors, and was a village arrangement widely employed throughout the southeast. The Coles Creek era Balmoral Mounds and early Plaquemine era Routh Mounds (occupied circa 1200 to 1350 CE) sites which features this same layout are also located on the western bank of Lake St Joseph near where the Taensa lived in the 17th century. =Chiefs residence= Great Temple and Great Suns cabin as drawn by Alexandre de Batz The temple and chiefly residence stood on opposite sides of the plaza. The chiefs cabin was a square building measuring on each side with clay plastered walls high and thick. It was capped by a roof in height that was covered in cane mats woven so tightly they were said to be waterproof. The great temple was similar in appearance but had three carved eagle effigies at its summit. Inside beaten copper plaques and painting adorned the walls. There was a fire of burning cane in the center and low couch-like beds lined the walls. The chief sat on one that acted as a throne where he would hold court surrounded by his wives, retainers, and advisers who were all dressed in white garments woven from mulberry bark. Included among the advisors were the lesser chiefs, headmen, and councillors who oversaw the other villages. =Great Temple= The Taensa temple compares with similar descriptions recorded by artist Alexandre de Batz of the main temple at the contemporaneous Grand Village of the Natchez. Like the Natchez temple, it was situated on a low platform mound flanking the plaza., but unlike the Natchez temple it was surrounded with a palisade of sharpened stakes decorated with human skulls taken during wars with their enemies. Inside the palisade was a large dome- shaped structure over in circumference. At the peak of the roof were three red, yellow, and white painted wooden eagle effigies. The bird carvings faced east toward the rising sun. Woven cane mats covered the structure's outer walls and roof, and the temple was painted red. A guardian lived in a small shed that stood near the door. Chroniclers describe the inside of the temple as having shelves holding oval-shaped split-cane baskets that were beautifully woven and painted. Inside were interred the bones of their chiefs and other honored dead, human and animal forms carved in stone, wood, and modeled as ceramic figurines, stuffed owls, jawbones of large fish, \\"heads and tails of extraordinary serpents\\", pieces of quartz crystal, and some European glass objects. There was also an altar decorated with a rope of human scalplocks. A ceremonial eternal fire representing the Sun was kept burning inside the building using an arrangement of three large hickory logs that were kept at a low burn and only slowly pushed into the fire. It was tended and guarded by two priests and other attendants who had a duty to make sure it was never extinguished. Except for the immediate relatives of the chief, all women and commoners were forbidden to enter the temple. Food offerings for their gods and the honored dead were frequently brought to the temple. Religion \\"ancestral couple\\" statues from the Etowah site in Georgia Taensa religious life revolved around the worship of the sun, represented by the sacred fire kept perpetually burning inside their temple. Their elite class of hereditary royalty were known as suns and like the Natchez they believed their chief, whose official name was Yak-stalchil (Great Sun), was matrilineally descended from the sun through his mother the \\"Grande Soleille\\" (French for \\"female Great Sun\\"). Their mythology claimed that in the distant past a man and woman who shone like the sun had come down to them to be their rulers. Afterwards they turned to stone. Stone statues fitting this description are recorded by early observers as being worshiped as the original couple in the temple. The Taensa rulers claimed descent from this mythological couple, making their social order in effect a solar theocracy. The eldest daughter of the female Great Sun inherited her mothers position. Her eldest son inherited the position and name of Yak-stalchil. Her second eldest son inherited the position of War Chief along with the name and title of Obalalkabiche (Tattooed Serpent). Similar Mississippian stone temple statues to the ones described have been found in northern Georgia, the Tennessee River Valley area around Nashville, Tennessee and on into western Tennessee and Kentucky, and southern Indiana and Illinois. Examples of this style are also known from wooden and ceramic versions. And although there is no direct waterway connecting the Tennessee-Cumberland region where these statues are most common, the Natchez Bluffs area was connected to the Nashville Basin in ancient times by the Natchez Trace, a pre-European native trade route. No stone statues have been found at Taensa archaeological sites, but two examples have been found at the Grand Village of the Natchez. The first was discovered in 1820 and the second in excavations into Mound C in 1930. =Mortuary traditions= Funeral procession of the Natchez Obalalkabiche (Tattooed Serpent) with retainers waiting to be sacrificed Upon the death of high-ranking individuals, the Taensa practiced ritual human sacrifice of retainers to accompany them as servants in the afterlife. An early chronicler, Henri de Tonti, wrote that when their Great Chief died, \\"They sacrifice his youngest wife, his house steward, and a hundred men to accompany him in the other world.\\" This high number is thought to be exaggerated compared to other known sacrificial deaths at similar rituals among the Natchez, which were recorded by other observers. French missionary Fran√ßois de Montigny reported that after the death of a chief, twelve victims were killed to accompany him. They were sacrificed by having their heads broken, and there would have been more victims without the French intervention. During his conversions and baptisms, de Montigny implored the Taensa to discontinue the practice. A few months later in the spring of 1700 the Taensa temple was struck by lightning. The Taensa priest immediately blamed its destruction on the French priest, because he had persuaded them to suspend their ancestral customs. After exhortations from the native priest, five women threw their children onto the flames of the burning temple as sacrificial victims. Great honor was associated with such a sacrifice, and the women were held in high esteem. After the sacrifice they were clothed in special white garments made of mulberry bark thread usually reserved for the nobility and had a white feather placed on their heads. They then were led in a procession to the chief's house, which was in the process of being converted into the new temple. People gave them gifts and there were eight days of ceremonies to honor them. Taensa mortuary traditions for the elites was to first bury the deceased and at a later date exhume and burn the body. The defleshed bones were then collected into a bundle and placed in a split cane basket which would then reside in the temple which also acted as a mortuary house. Language Early chroniclers de Montigny, Saint-Cosme, and Antoine- Simon Le Page du Pratz described the Taensa language as being nearly identical with the Natchez language; the missionaries were learning the latter language in their efforts to convert the Natchez and Taensa to Christianity. Linguists consider the Natchezan language family to be a language isolate. The best known connection proposed between Natchezan languages and other languages is Mary Haas' Gulf hypothesis, in which she conceived of a macrofamily comprising Muskogean and a number of language isolates of the southeastern US: Atakapa, Chitimacha, Natchez/Taensa, and Tunica. This hypothesis is now generally rejected by historical linguists; but a number of Muskogean scholars continue to believe that Muskogean is related to Natchez. The meaning of the Taensa name is unknown, although it is believed by anthropologists and linguists to be an autonym. The Chitimacha, the group with which they eventually merged, referred to them by the exonym Ch≈ç¬¥sha. Taensa language hoax Between 1880-1882, a young clerical student in Paris named Jean Parisot published what was purported to be \\"material of the Taensa language, including papers, songs, a grammar and vocabulary\\"; this generated considerable interest among philologists. There was doubt about this material for many years; noted American anthropologist and linguist John R. Swanton conclusively proved the work to be a hoax in a series of publications in 1908-1910.

Having served as an important figure in the gradual independence of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) from Britain, he became the third Governor-General of Ceylon (1954-1962). He was the first Ceylonese individual to hold the vice-regal post. Early life and education Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke was born 20 October 1892 in Trincomalee in the northeast of Ceylon. He was the fifth child of eight and only son of Alfred Goonetilleke and Emily Jayasekera. His father who served in the Ceylon Postal Service was the postmaster of Trincomalee at the time of his birth. He was educated at Wesley College in Colombo where he won many prizes and scholarships including the Hill Medal and the Gogerly Scholarship. After completing his secondary education, Goonetilleke joined the teaching staff of Wesley College as an assistant teacher. He later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of London as an external student. Early career After gaining his degree, he left his teaching post and joined the Bank of Colombo as a sub- accountant, then became the manager of the Ceylon Daily News. Public service career Few years later Goonetilleke joined the government service having been appointed as an Assistant Railway Auditor.  Auditor General  Goonetilleke was the first Ceylonese to be appointed as Colonial Auditor of the crown colony of Ceylon on 25 June 1931. With the implementation of the Donoughmore Constitution, the title of the head of the Audit Department was changed to Auditor General of Ceylon and Goonetilleke became the first to hold the new appointment on 7 July 1931 and hold it till February 1946.HISTORY OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL‚ÄôS DEPARTMENT As the Colonial Auditor he was an ex-officio member of the Executive Council of Ceylon in 1931. He took on additional duties as Chairman of the Salaries and Cadres Commission, Civil Defense Commissioner and Food Commissioner.  Civil Defense Commissioner  With the onset of World War II in the Far East and the likelihood that Ceylon would face a military threat from Japan, Goonetilleke was given the additional duty as Civil Defence Commissioner in the War Cabinet of Ceylon, heading the newly formed Civil Defence Department to undertake civil defense preparations. Some civil defence works such as knocking down buildings to create fire breaks in Colombo proved unpopular, but proved to be justified when the Imperial Japanese Navy carried out air raids on Colombo and other cities in the spring of 1942. In this capacity, Ivor Jennings, Principle of the Ceylon University College, served as Goonetilleke's deputy, and the two worked closely with D. S. Senanayake, the Minister of Agriculture and Lands. This group was known as \\"the Breakdown Gang\\" as they began to talk about much besides civil defence, including the steps that might be taken to move Ceylon to complete independence after the war.Today is his 24th death Anniversary : Sir Oliver Goonetilleke - first Ceylonese Governor-GeneralSir Oliver Goonetilleke (1892 ‚Äì1978): The Road To Independence He was knighted in 1944 with a KBE for his services as the Civil Defense Commissioner in the New Year Honours. However, on 18 December 1946, questions were raised in the House of Commons by Douglas Dodds-Parker on irregularities in the Auditor-General's Report on Civil Defence Expenditure for 1943‚Äì44 and 1944‚Äì45.CEYLON (AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORT)  Negotiations for independence  In 1943, a declaration was made for grant of government for all the matters of civil administration in Ceylon. The Senanayake, Goonetilleke and Jennings drafted a constitution, known as the \\"Ministers' Draft\\", and submitted it to British Government in February 1944. At this time Goonetilleke who was appointed the Commissioner of Food went to Britain to discuss an urgent food supplies. There he met Lord Soulbury who had been appointed to lead a Commission to Ceylon, pressing his case for self- rule. Goonetilleke was thereafter advised Senanayake on approaching the members of the Soulbury Commission when they arrived in Ceylon in December 1944. Goonetilleke became an \\"unofficial secretary\\" to the commission and significantly influenced it.  Financial Secretary  With the war drawing to a close and the closure of the Civil Defence Department, Goonetilleke left his post of Colonial Auditor which he held since 1931 to take up appointment as Financial Secretary of Ceylon in February 1946. The Financial Secretary was head of the Treasury and responsible for all financial policy of the colony. As the Financial Secretary, Goonetilleke sat in both the Board of Ministers and the Executive Council. He was the first Ceylonese to hold the post of Financial Secretary. He held the position until his resignation in September 1947. He was awarded KCMG in the 1948 New Year Honours for his service as Financial Secretary, Ceylon. Political career The first Cabinet of Ministers of Ceylon Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development With Ceylon gaining dominion status within the British Commonwealth, in 1947 the first cabinet of ministers was formed with Senanayake as Prime Minister after the 1947 general elections. Goonetilleke was appointed as the Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development on 26 September 1947. He had been appointed to the newly formed upper house of parliament, the Senate of Ceylon and became the Leader of the Senate when both houses were ceremonially opened by the Duke of Gloucester, marking the independence of Ceylon on 4 February 1948.First Parliament of Independent Sri Lanka is inaugurated High Commissioner to the United Kingdom His term as a Cabinet Minister did not last long as he resigned on 22 July 1948 and was appointed the first Ceylonese High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.Former Sri Lankan High Commissioners in the United Kingdom.

Minister of Finance Following the Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake's resignation after the Hartal 1953, Sir John Kotelawala succeeded him. Goonetilleke was appointed by Kotelawala to his cabinet as Ministry of Finance and the Treasury on 14 October 1953, while holding the post of Leader of the Senate. Once again his ministerial tenure was brief, lasting only till June 1954.Page 166 of Encyclopedia of Sri Lanka. Encyclopedia of Sri Lanka. Governor-General Shortly after a visit by Queen Elizabeth II to Ceylon in April 1954, the decision was taken to appoint a Ceylonese native to the post of Governor-General, succeeding Lord Soulbury. D. S. Senanayake had died in 1952, and Colonel Sir John Kotalawela was Prime Minister when Goonetilleke succeeded to the position and took up residence in Queen's House. He was a friend of the powerful philanthropist Sir Ernest de Silva who assisted him in the ascension to Governor-General. He remained in office after the election of the left-wing S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike as Prime Minister defeating Sir John Kotalawela in the 1956 general elections. Bandaranaike was pressured to remove Goonetilleke, and reduce the pay of the Governor-General by members of his left-wing coalition. 1958 communal riots On 24 May 1958 Communal riots erupted, Prime Minister Bandaranaike did not make a formal response. With violence spreading throughout the island, Goonetilleke declared a state of emergency on 27 May 1958 and deployed the armed forces to quell the rioting, while Bandaranaike allowed Goonetilleke to take control of the situation and issue orders to the armed forces to suppress the rioting with force. Goonetilleke authorized the armed forces to shoot rioters, and the armed forces restored order in a few days.Riot control ‚Äì then and now Bandaranaike assassination Goonetilleke once again was forced to take decisive action, on 25 September 1959 when Prime Minister Bandaranaike was shot at his home at Rosmead Place while meeting the public. Goonetilleke was at Queens House accepting letters of credence of the Italian Ambassador Count Paolo di Michelis di Sloughhello, when he was informed about the assassination attempt he stopped the ceremony and rushed to Rosmead Place. He informed parliament to continue and at 11 AM declared a state of emergency, bringing the military to full readiness and mobilizing reservists. Bandaranaike, who was rushed to hospital and into emergency surgery, died twenty-two hours after he was shot. Bandaranaike had been scheduled to go to New York to attend the UN General Assembly in late September 1959. The Leader of the House C. P. de Silva was in London undergoing treatment and Bandaranaike had sent a letter to the Governor General recommending that he appoint Wijeyananda Dahanayake, Minister of Education as acting Prime Minister during his absence. With this letter present, Goonetilleke appointed Dahanayake as Prime Minister on September 26, 1959 and was later confirmed by Parliament.The legend that was Daha Political turmoil Following the assassination of Bandaranaike, the country faced a period of political instability. The Premiership of Dahanayake lasted one year, with many changes to his cabinet. Fresh elections were called, but the elections in March 1960 were in-divisive as Dudley Senanayake formed a government for a brief period. Goonetilleke had a difficult decision when faced with the classic difficulty for a Governor-General, whether to dissolve Parliament, causing a new election, or call on a different faction to form a government when the Prime Minister (in this case Dudley Senanayake, son of his old friend) lost Parliament's confidence. He dissolved the parliament and called for fresh elections. He briefly held the portfolio of Minister of Finance from 21 March 1960 to 23 April 1960. Bandaranaike's widow Sirima Bandaranaike was selected by his party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as its leader and won elections in July 1960. Goonetilleke called on Sirima Bandaranaike to form a government and she became the world's first female Prime Minister. 1962 attempted military coup In January 1962, the information surfaced of attempted military coup against the government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, with the suspected leaders. Prime Minister's nephew Felix Dias Bandaranaike, Parliamentary Secretary for Defence and External Affairs stated in Parliament on 18 February 1962 that Sir Oliver's name had come up in the investigations. Goonetilleke indicated he had no objection to be questioned by the police, however Bandaranaikes wanted to replace the Governor-General. Bradman Weerakoon, secretary to the prime minister was dispatched London to present the Prime Minister's request to the Queen to replace her Governor-General in Ceylon. On 26 February 1962, Radio Ceylon announced that the Queen had accepted the request of the Government of Ceylon to appoint William Gopallawa as Governor-General of Ceylon succeeding Sir Oliver Goonetilleke with effect from 20 March 1962. William Gopallawa was the Prime Minister's uncle. Goonetilleke quietly left Queen's House on 2 March and left the country.The Kataragama factor and the 1962 coup His tenor lasted eight years and five prime ministers. Later life Goonetilleke settled into a retired life in London, in a self-imposed exile. In the investigation into the attempted military coup, some of the crown witnesses tried to link him and former Prime Ministers, Dudley Senanayake and Colonel Sir John Kotelawala, with the conspiracy; this was never proven. In his retirement in London, Sir Oliver with his considerable accumulated wealth became an underwriting member of Lloyd's of London and moved in the social circles of the day. He was also an avid horse racing enthusiast and horse owner with his horses racing at Epsom and Ascot. In 1964, he was accused by Philip Gunawardena of moves against the government Bandaranaike. Goonetilleke also faced many accusations of exchange fraud, for taking considerable sums of money out from Ceylon.  Exchange control offences conviction  In 1972, he was tried in absentia and sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 950,000 ($125,000) for exchange control offences by the Criminal Justice Commission. He was not extradited, his daughter Sheila Sathananthan was given a two‚Äêyear suspended sentence and fined $72,000 and her husband Coomaraswany Sathananthan was jailed for two years and fined $35,000. Following the defeat of Bandaranaike in the 1977 general election, the newly elected Prime Minister J. R. Jayewardene, repealed the Criminal Justice Commissions Act and released all who were jailed under the provisions of the Act with an amnesty declared. This allowed Goonetilleke to return to Sri Lanka, where he died after a brief illness in 1978.Sir Oliver Goonetilleke: Life In Exile Legacy A biography under the title 'OEG' was written by Charles Joseph Jeffries, and memorials to Goonetilleke include a six-foot bronze statue by sculptor Tissa Ranasinghe, commissioned by his family and installed in 1967 at a major roundabout in Colombo. Personal life Sir Oliver first married Esther (n√©e Jayawardena) and had three children, Joyce Wijesinghe, Shiela Sathananthan and Ernie Goonetilleke. Esther died of a fatal illness when the three children were very young and before he entered the civil service. During his self-imposed exile in London, Sir Oliver married Phyllis Miller, who was the secretary of the Soulbury Commission, whom he had befriended during the period of the Commission circa 1944, and lived near Marble Arch at 14, Albion Gate, Hyde Park Place, London W2 prior to his death in 1978. He was a Director of the YMCA and held several high positions in the Diocese of the Anglican Church of Ceylon. Honours Throughout his life, Goonetilleke had close links with Britain, visiting the country many times on official business, and receiving a string of British honours: * Knight Grand Cross of The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (GCMG)-1954 (KCMG: 1948; CMG: 1940) * Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO)-1951 * Knight Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE)-1944 * Knight of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem  See also  *Sri Lankan Non Career Diplomats ReferencesExternal links * Amara Samara in Sinhala.

Introduced by Massachusetts Congressman John W. Weeks and signed into law by President William Howard Taft, the law authorized the US Secretary of Agriculture to \\"Examine, locate and recommend for purchase ... such lands within the watersheds of navigable streams as ... may be necessary to the regulation of flow of navigable streams....\\" This meant that the federal government would be able to purchase private land if the purchase was deemed necessary to protect rivers' and watersheds' headwaters in the eastern United States.Davis, Richard C. \\"Weeks Act 1911.\\" Encyclopedia of American Forest History(1983): 685. Furthermore, the law allowed for land acquired through this act to be preserved and maintained as national forest territory. Six years earlier, the Transfer Act of 1905 transferred control over the federal forest reserves from the General Land Office of the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture and its Forest Service. Responsibility for land purchased through the Weeks Act was not given to former Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot because he resigned in 1907, with the stipulation that he would only resign if he could appoint his successor. This stipulation led to the Forest Service's tradition of picking a head with forestry knowledge. With the land acquired through the Weeks Act, Pinchot's successor obtained the power to issue permits for water power development on National Forests. The Weeks Act appropriated $9 million to purchase 6 million acres (24,000 km2) of land in the eastern United States.A History of Water Resource activities of the United States Department of Agriculture The Weeks Act also provided measures for more cooperation between federal and state governments in regard to fire control. This legislation was heavily influenced by the fire season of 1910 because it wreaked havoc across the western United States, particularly in Idaho, where 85 people, including 72 firefighters, were killed in fires and more than 3 million acres (12,000 km2) of land and roughly 8,000,000,000 board feet (19,000,000 m3) of timber were destroyed by fires that year. This year's fire season alone put the US Forest Service $1.1 million in debt.Cermak, Robert W. Fire In The Forest-A History of Forest Fire Control on the National Forests in California 1898-1956 USDA Forest Service Publishers, 2005 p.58 The Weeks Act also authorized establishment of the National Forest Reservation Commission to consider and approve purchase of these identified lands. The commission was composed of the secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and War (for the Corps of Engineers), as well as two members each from the House and Senate. Jacob Gallinger, who had sponsored the Senate‚Äôs version of the bill, was named a member of the initial committee.Protection and Restoration The Commission would exist from 1911 to 1966.National Forest Reservation Commission Members, 1911-1966 The drafting of Weeks Act was originally motivated by the intent to purchase lands in eastern United States, where the federal government owned no large tracts of land devoted to conservation. Later western lands were acquired under the Weeks Act. The Weeks Act was substantially expanded and modified by the Clarke‚ÄìMcNary Act in 1924. Major national forests that were formed under the Weeks Act are the Allegheny National Forest, White Mountain National Forest, Green Mountain National Forest, Pisgah National Forest, George Washington National Forest, and Ottawa National Forest. To date, the Weeks Act has protected more than 20 million acres of forestland, which has had a tremendous benefit for ecosystems and society by providing habitat for plants and animals, creating lucrative recreation spots for tourists, and creating economic opportunities for local communities, stimulating the economy.Weeks Act - Forest History Society, Retrieved 2015-11-23. The Weeks Act effectively outlawed some Native American fire management practices.

Clarke and Senator Charles McNary. The 1911 Weeks Act had allowed the purchase of land to enlarge the National Forest System. Two years after the Weeks Act was passed, over 700,000 acres (2,800 km¬≤) had been purchased for the National Forest system in the Eastern United States. More than 2 million acres (8,000 km¬≤) of land had been purchased by 1920. The Clarke‚ÄìMcNary Act made it much easier for the Forest Service to buy land from willing sellers within predetermined national forest boundaries. It enabled the Secretary of Agriculture to work cooperatively with State officials for better forest protection, chiefly in fire control and water resources. It also provided for continuous production of timber. Additionally, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began working with private forestland owners in reforestation. That was done by broadening the cooperative efforts to include producing and distributing tree seedlings and providing forestry assistance to farmers. The laws also gave a strong impetus to states to establish and to support state forestry agencies. All 50 states now have a state forestry agency or forestry extension agency.

The states of Bihar and West Bengal lie on the Indo- Gangetic plain. Jharkhand is situated on the Chota Nagpur Plateau. Odisha lies on the Eastern Ghats and the Deccan Plateau. West Bengal's capital Kolkata is the largest city of this region. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is the country's third largest. The region is bounded by Bhutan, Nepal and the state of Sikkim in the north, the states of Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on the west, the state of Andhra Pradesh in the south and the country of Bangladesh in the east. It is also bounded by the Bay of Bengal in the south-east. It is connected to the Seven Sister States of Northeast India by the narrow Siliguri Corridor in the north east of West Bengal. The region was ruled by several empires, including Gangaridai, Nandas, Mauryans, Guptas, Palas, Senas, Eastern Gangas, Gajapatis, Delhi Sultanate, Bengal Sultanate, Mughal Empire and the British Empire. History Kalinga Empire The extent of the Maurya Empire The extent of the Delhi Sultanate During the Neolithic period, agriculture started in South Asia. Neolithic settlements have been found in Chirand. In the Kabra-Kala mound at the confluence of the Son and North Koel rivers in Palamu district, various antiquities and art objects from the Neolithic to medieval periods have been found; the pot-sherds of redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware, and NBP ware are from the Chalcolithic to late medieval periods. There are ancient cave paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district, from the Meso-chalcolithic period (9,000‚Äì5,000 BC). From Kuchai, near Baripada, various Neolithic tools like hoes, chisels, pounders, mace heads, grinding stones and also pieces of pottery. Prehistoric paintings and inscriptions have also been found in Garjan Dongar in Sundergarh district, and Ushakothi in Sambalpur district and Vimkramkhol in Jharsuguda district. There has been an uncertainty about the inscriptions at Ushakothi and Vimkramkhol regarding whether they are in a proto-Brahmi script. Yogimath near Khariar has cave paintings from the Neolithic. There is Chalcolithic sites in Pandu Rajar Dhibi in the lower Ajay valley in West Bengal. Iron slag, microliths, and potsherds from 1400 BCE, according to carbon dating, were discovered in Singhbhum district. During the late Vedic period, several janapadas emerged in India. In the 6th century BCE, the mahajanapadas emerged in several parts of the Indian subcontinent. The region was the historical centre of the Nanda, Maurya, Shunga, Gupta and Pala empires that ruled much of the Indian sub- continent at their prime. In medieval India, it was incorporated into the Mughal, Maratha and then the British empire. After independence in 1947, the states joined the Indian Union and took their current form after the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. Today, they continue to face problems of overpopulation, environmental degradation and pervasive corruption despite significant economic and social progress. After the Kalinga War the Maurya king Ashoka sent emissaries to spread Buddhism across Asia. The famous university of Nalanda was in Bihar. Chinese travellers visited Buddhist and Hindu temples and libraries in the universities of Magadha Empire. The Emperor of Kalinga Mahameghavahana Aira Kharavela was one of the most powerful monarchs of ancient India. The Jain thirkhankar Mahaveer was born here and founded Jainism. Konark Sun Temple built by the Eastern Ganga dynasty is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Odisha Islamic invasions in the 13th century resulted in the collapse of Hindu kings and most Buddhists, especially in East Bengal, converted to Islam. East India including Bihar and West Bengal was part of the Mughal Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries. Odisha remained a powerful Hindu dynasty under the rule of Soma/Keshari Dynasty, Eastern Ganga Dynasty, Surya Dynasty till the end of the 16th century. The mighty Nalanda University existed at Nalanda which was destroyed by Bakhtiar Khilji during the 12th century and also defeated Sena Dynasty. Sher Shah Suri, who became king of India after defeating Humayun, founded the city of Patna on the ruins of ancient Pataliputra. Islam arrived during the 6th‚Äì7th century AD and became dominant gradually since the early 13th century with the advent of Muslim rulers as well as Sunni missionaries such as Shah Jalal in the region. Later, Muslim rulers, starting from the Delhi Sultanate initiated the preaching of Islam by building mosques. From the 14th century onward, it was ruled by the Bengal Sultanate, founded by king Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, beginning a period of the country's economic prosperity and military dominance over the regional empires, which was referred by the Europeans to as the richest country to trade with.Nanda, J. N (2005). Afterwards, the entire East India came under the Mughal Empire, becoming as the most advanced parts in the world. Bengal Subah generated almost half of the empire's GDP and 12% of the world's GDP,Maddison, Angus (2003): Development Centre Studies The World Economy Historical Statistics: Historical Statistics, OECD Publishing, , pages 259‚Äì261 larger than the entirety of western Europe, ushering in the period of proto- industrialization. With the arrival of the Europeans in the 17th century, outposts were established in Odisha Coast and Bengal. The European traders established their trade centres in the famous ports of Balasore, Pipili, Palur in the Odisha Coast during the rule of the last independent Hindu king Gajapati Prataprudra Dev. The Portuguese were in Chittagong, Dutch in Chinsura, French in Pondicherry and the English founded Calcutta. The Maratha Invasion of Bengal badly affected the economy of Bengal and it is estimated that 400,000 Bengali Muslims in were butchered brutally by the Hindu Maratha bargis and many women and children gang raped, and the genocide has been considered to be among the deadliest massacres in Indian history. In 1756, the British East India Company defeated the local Indian Muslim rulers in Plassey and established British Rule in the subcontinent. Its capital Calcutta grew into one of the world's greatest ports. Tea from Calcutta was off-loaded by American separatists in the American War of Independence in the 1770s. In the 19th century, Calcutta's traders and merchants traded with the rest of the British Empire, continental Europe, the United States and China. Indentured Indian labourers from Bihar, sailed to new homes in Fiji, Mauritius, Guyana, Surinam and South Africa. India's independence movement had strong roots in East India. The feudal land system, established through the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, was unpopular among the peasant cultivators and the numerous agricultural labourers found all over Bihar and Bengal (Khetmazdoors). The Indian Rebellion of 1857 started in Bengal. British war propaganda asserted there were atrocities by the mutinous soldiers in the Black Hole of Calcutta. Eventually the British prevailed, and Calcutta remained capital of Britain's Asian dominions until 1911. During Gandhi's independence movement, the Bihari village of Champaran was an important supporter of non-violent resistance. Great poets of the stature of Rabindranath Tagore championed the movement for self-rule. The Partition also had its roots in undivided Eastern India. The Muslim League was founded in Dhaka in 1906. In the 1937 provincial elections, it came to power in Bengal in alliance with the Krishak Praja Party. in 1944, it gained an absolute majority in the Bengal Assembly, and Hussein Suhrawardy became the Chief Minister. After widespread communal violence during the Direct Action Day protests in Calcutta, leading to further communal violence across British India, the creation of Pakistan became inevitable. In 1947, further communal violence displaced millions as independence and partition of British India occurred. Some Bihari and Bengali Muslims fled to the newly created East Pakistan. Most East Bengal Hindus fled to India. The 1950s saw industrial progress in East India. These were cut short with the conflict in neighbouring East Pakistan and by the Communist movement at home. In 1971, in the course of Bangladesh's independence struggle, millions of refugees poured into East India. From the turn of the 21st century, West Bengal's economic growth has been rapid, and it now ranks as the fourth largest GDP contributor after Maharashtra, according to the List of Indian states by GDP and is now one of the fastest-growing economies among the states of India. Bihar and Odisha struggled with economic issues during the British rule and in the beginning of post independent India. But in recent years, these two states have shown impressive growth record and developed steadily. The economic boom since 2005 started to spread new malls, highways, airports and IT office complexes, but not evenly across the region. Jharkhand became a separate state on 15 November 2000. In the modern times, these states have seen rapid transformation and home to several mineral and metal based industries, coal based thermal powers units, oil refineries, ports, textile industries and well established public and private educational institutes. Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand rank 14th, 16th and 18th in the List of Indian states by GDP. Odisha has shown consistent growth in the state GDP and received the recognition of the fastest-growing economy among the states in India. Education Nalanda, Puspagiri and Vikramshila universities were the famed institutions of higher learning in ancient India located in Eastern India. One of the first great universities in recorded history was the ancient Nalanda University located in Bihar and another institute of higher learning was the ancient Puspagiri University recently discovered in Odisha. Education in the eastern part of India has seen rapid transformation. Several new educational institutes have been established to cater the needs of students. East India is now the home to some of the great Indian universities and Institutions of National Importance. Some prominent institutions of higher learning located in the states of Eastern India are listed below.

However, the mid-sized cities of Asansol, Durgapur, Siliguri in West Bengal are rapidly growing urban areas. West Bengal is the highest contributor of GDP among all other eastern state for India and it is also one of the Fastest-growing states in India. West Bengal is the hub of industry and economic activities in Eastern India and it is also the home to the tallest skylines located in this region and are also one of the tallest buildings in the country. It is also the home of history of rising India.

Cuisine West Bengal Bengali cuisine is a culinary style originating in Bengal which is now divided between the Indian state of West Bengal and today's Bangladesh. Other regions, such as Tripura, and the Barak Valley region of Assam (in India) including some parts of Jharkhand and Bihar also have large native Bengali populations and share this cuisine. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice as a staple diet, Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the Indian subcontinent that is analogous in structure to the modern service √† la russe style of French cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once. Bengali food has inherited a large number of influences, both foreign and pan-Indian, arising from a historical and strong trade links with many parts of the world. Bengal fell under the sway of various Turkic rulers from the early thirteenth century onwards, and was then governed by the British for two centuries (1757‚Äì1947). Odisha Odia cuisine refers to the cooking of the eastern Indian state of Odisha. Foods from this area are rich and varied, while relying heavily on local ingredients. The flavours are usually subtle and delicately spiced, quite unlike the fiery curries typically associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood such as crab and shrimp are very popular. Chicken and mutton are also consumed, but somewhat occasionally. Only 6% of the population of Odisha is vegetarian, and this is reflected in its cuisine. The oil base used is mostly mustard oil, but in festivals ghee is used. Panch phutana, a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (nigella) is widely used for tempering vegetables and dals, while garam masala (curry powder) and haladi (turmeric) are commonly used for non-vegetarian curries. Pakhala, a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets and no Oriya repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. Festivals and fasts witness a cuisine without onion and garlic, whereas other days witness an aroma of garlic and onion paste in curries. One can find restaurants serving food without onion and garlic in major places like Puri and other coastal area, which is run by Brahmin owners. Odisha has a culinary tradition spanning centuries if not millennia. The kitchen of the famous Jagannath temple in Puri is reputed to be the largest in the world, with a thousand cooks, working around 752 wood-burning clay hearths called chulas, to feed over 10,000 people everyday.

These paintings date to as early as 8000 BCE and from such painting the antiquity of musical instrument Ghumura and Damru can be imagined. The origin of Ghumura goes back to ancient times. There is a beautiful waterfall in the river valley of Indravati which was initially recognised by Chindak Naagas of Chakrakot.Epigraphica Indica, IX, p. 179 Many believe that Ghumura dance originated from this river valley and gradually spread into the areas between Indravati and Mahanadi, indicating this dance form belongs to the 10th century CE. The western Odisha has also great variety of dance forms unique to Odisha culture. The children's verses are known as \\"Chhiollai\\", \\"Humobauli\\" and \\"Dauligit\\". The adolescent poems are \\"Sajani\\", \\"Chhata\\", \\"Daika\\", \\"Bhekani\\".

They have distinctive characteristics in the music of Bengal, popular in India and Bangladesh.Ghosh, p. xiii \\"Sangeet\\" means music, \\"Rabindra Sangeet\\" means Songs of Rabindra. Rabindra Sangeet used Indian classical music and traditional folk music as sources. Tagore wrote some 2,230 songs. Rabindranath Tagore was a towering figure in Indian music. Writing in Bengali, he created a library of over 2,000 songs now known by Bengalis as rabindra sangeet whose form is primarily influenced by Hindustani classical, sub-classicals, Karnatic, western, bauls, bhatiyali and different folk songs of India. Many singers in West Bengal and Bangladesh base their entire careers on the singing of Tagore musical masterpieces. The national anthem of India and national anthem of Bangladesh are Rabindra Sangeets. West Bengal's capital Kolkata is also the cultural capital of India. Panchali is a form of narrative folk songs of the Indian state of West Bengal. The word Panchali probably originates from panchal or panchalika, meaning puppet. According to another school of that, Panchali originates from the word panch, which means five in Bengali language, referring to the five elements of this genre: song, music, extempore versifying, poetic contests, and dance. Music of Odisha Odissi music is a classical music in India originated from the eastern state of Odisha. Indian Classical music has five significant branches: Avanti, Panchali, Udramagadhi, Hindustani and carnatic. Of these, Udramagadhi exists in the form of Odissi music. Generally, Odissi is one of the classical dances of India performed with Odissi music. Odissi music got shaped during the time of famous Oriya poet, Jayadeva, who composed lyrics meant to be sung. By the 11th century CE folk music of Odisha existing in the form of Triswari, Chatuhswari, and Panchaswari was modified into the classical style. However, Odissi songs were written even before the Odia language developed. Odissi music has a rich legacy dating back to the 2nd century BCE, when king Kharvela, the ruler of Odisha (Kalinga) patronised this music and dance. Like Hindustani and Carnatic systems, Odissi music is a separate system of Indian classical music and is having all the essential as well as potential ingredients of Indian Classical form. But it has not come to limelight due to apathy from the time of British rule in Odisha, want of its proper study, revival, propagation, etc. Despite the fact, the traditional music form could be saved and maintained in its pristine form. Thanks to the musicians particularly of Jaga Akhadas of Puri district, who could develop and maintain the music. The music movement of Odisha, however, took a different turn after independence. Like other aspects of her culture, music of the sacred land (Odisha) is charming, colourful, variegated encompassing various types. The existing musical tradition of Odisha, the cumulative experience of the last two thousand five hundred years if not more, can broadly be grouped under five categories such as: (1) Tribal Music, (2) Folk Music, (3) Light Music, (4) Light-Classical Music, (5) Classical Music, which need a short elucidations for better understanding the subject in all India context. The tribal music as the title signifies is confined to the tribals living mainly in the hilly and jungle regions and sparsely in the coastal belt of Odisha. Odisha has the third largest concentration of tribes constituting about one fourth of the total population. They are distributed over 62 tribal communities. Odisha is the treasure house of Folk Songs which are sung on different festivals and specific occasions in their own enjoyment. Folk music in general is the expression of the ethos and mores of the folk communities. Of the bewildering variety of folk music of Odisha, mention may be made of Geeta, Balipuja Geeta, Kela Keluni Geeta, Dalkhai Geeta, Kendra Geeta, Jaiphula Geeta, Ghumura Geeta, Ghoda Nacha and Danda Nacha Geeta, Gopal Ugala and Osa-Parva-Geeta etc. Bhajan, Janan, Oriya songs based on ragas, Rangila Chaupadi etc. are grouped under Light classical music, which forms an important segment of Oriya music. Sri Geetagovinda, Anirjukta Pravadha, Divya Manusi Prabandha, Chautisa, Chhanda, Chaupadi (now known as Odissi), Champu, Malasri, Sariman, nVyanjani, Chaturang, Tribhang, Kuduka Geeta, Laxana and Swaramalika are the various sub- forms, which individually or collectively constitute the traditional Odissi music. These sub-forms of the traditional Odissi music, can be categorised under the classical music of Odisha.

On single crystals Adsorbed species on single crystal surfaces are frequently found to exhibit long-range ordering; that is to say that the adsorbed species form a well-defined overlayer structure. Each particular structure may only exist over a limited coverage range of the adsorbate, and in some adsorbate/substrate systems a whole progression of adsorbate structure are formed as the surface coverage is gradually increased. The periodicity of the overlayer (which often is larger than that of the substrate unit cell) can be determined by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), because there will be additional diffraction beams associated with the overlayer. Types There are two types of overlayers: commensurate and incommensurate. In the former the substrate-adsorbate interaction tends to dominate over any lateral adsorbate-adsorbate interaction, while in the latter the adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are of similar magnitude to those between adsorbate and substrate. Notation An overlayer on a substrate can be notated in either Wood's notation or matrix notation. Wood's notation Wood's notation takes the form : \\\\text{M}(hk\\\\ell) - \\\\left( \\\\tfrac{\\\\textbf{a}_0}{\\\\textbf{a}_s} \\\\times \\\\tfrac{\\\\textbf{b}_0}{\\\\textbf{b}_s} \\\\right) - \\\\text{R}\\\\alpha^\\\\circ - \\\\text{A} where M is the chemical symbol of the substrate, A is the chemical symbol of the overlayer, (hk\\\\ell) are the Miller indices of the surface plane, R and \\\\alpha correspond to the rotational difference between the substrate and overlayer vectors, and the vector magnitudes shown are those of the substrate (s subscripts) and of the overlayer (0 subscripts). This notation can only describe commensurate overlayers however, while matrix notation can describe both. Matrix notation Matrix notation differs from Wood's notation in the second term, which is replaced by the G matrix that describes the overlayer primitive vectors in terms of the substrate primitive vectors: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\textbf{a}_0\\\\ \\\\textbf{b}_0 \\\\end{pmatrix}= G \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\textbf{a}_s\\\\ \\\\textbf{b}_s \\\\end{pmatrix} , where G=\\\\begin{pmatrix} G_{11} & G_{12}\\\\ G_{21}& G_{22}\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} and so hence matrix notation has the form : \\\\text{M}(hk\\\\ell) - G - \\\\text{R}\\\\alpha^\\\\circ - \\\\text{A} See also * Surface reconstruction * Superstructure * LEED#Superstructures CitationsReferences=Textbooks * * Websites * Category:Surface science ","title":"Overlayer"},{"id":"3799864","text":"The Twelve Tribes of Israel were the traditional kin groups among the ancient Israelites.

The Austrian Lloyd was running regular services from Trieste to the Near East, India, China and the Far East, Brazil, the USA and Northern Europe. It also was one of the first to use steam ships. The company's name was changed to Lloyd Triestino in 1919, when Trieste became a part of Italy. At this time, the company also faced major restructuring in order to recover losses incurred during World War I. By the end of the 1930s, Lloyd Triestino, with its offshoot Marittima Italiana, was once again a major world shipping power, owning a fleet of 85 vessels with 17 services to east Africa, southern Africa, Asia, and Australia. The company was crippled by the devastation of World War II in the 1940s. During the war, Lloyd Triestino lost 68 ships and 1,000 sailors. At the end, they were reduced to a fleet of just five ships and were once again faced with a massive recovery operation. By 1956, the Lloyd Triestino fleet had grown to 31 ships.

It is located on Highway 23, approximately north of Lethbridge and south of Calgary.  History  Homesteaders began arriving in the Champion area in 1904 and 1905, mainly from the USA, Eastern Canada, and Britain. The vast prairie grasslands, cut through by the Little Bow River, provided ideal country for farming and ranching. One of these settlers was Martin G. Clever, who arrived in 1905. He homesteaded on the quarter section of land (160 acres) where the town of Champion is currently located. The birth of the town was the product of the rapid settlement of the farming and ranching land in the area, but it was also fuelled by the discovery of coal. Homesteader Henry Therriualt opened the first coal mine in the area in 1906, and soon farmers were travelling from neighbouring towns (including Nanton and Stavely) to purchase coal from the Therriault mine. Their journey took them through the Clever homestead to reach the mine, and soon Martin Clever realized the business opportunity that presented itself. Soon, a country store and a mail route were established. When the storeowner (George Mark) applied to have a government post office located, the burgeoning settlement required a name, and in honour of Martin Clever, Cleverville was christened. Several other thriving businesses soon sprung up, thanks to Martin Clever's offer of the free use of his land: Cleverville was soon home to three general stores, a millinery and linen shop, drug store, butcher shop, blacksmith shop, livery stable, restaurant, two real estate offices, lumber yard, Bank of Hamilton, and doctor's office. In 1910 the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) reached the area, although it became apparent that the rails themselves would not run directly past Cleverville. As a result, the townspeople decided to move, using horses and skids and wagons, all of the buildings of the town to a new location closer to the railway. This new settlement required a new name, and so the relocated Cleverville became the new Village of Champion. Although there are several stories regarding how Champion got its name, the most likely (or at least the one most commonly retold) is that it was named after H.T. Champion, a banker in the Winnipeg firm Alloway and Champion, well-known bankers and loaners throughout the period of settlement of the west. The Alloway and Champion Bank in Winnipeg, Manitoba built in 1905 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. Alloway and Champion Bank When the town of Champion was relocated, so the story goes, a Winnipeg C.P.R. man named the town after the prominent banker. The Village of Champion received its charter on May 27, 1911, and the first council meeting was held in June. The growing village required ever more services, and soon Champion was home to its first grain elevator (1912), a telephone office, a school (1913), recreational facilities, and an ever- growing number of retail shops and businesses. A local newspaper, The Champion Chronicle, was also started in 1918 or 1919, and remained in print until 1943. Agriculture sustained the growth of the Champion area. In 1915 Champion became known as the \\"Million Bushel Town,\\" as one million bushels of wheat were shipped that year. The Champion Board of Trade was eager to promote the village as a land of opportunity, and in 1913 published the promotional pamphlet \\"Grain Golden Champion,\\" which was sent around the world to entice settlers and entrepreneurs to move to the area. Claiming that \\"of all the thriving towns and cities in Western Canada, destined to become the industrial centres of the future, none has established its position, or grown to such importance, in so brief a space of time, as Champion,\\" the Board of Trade invited people to take up opportunities in, of course, grain farming, but also in poultry- and stock-raising, railway work, brick- and cement-making, and the development of the natural gas and coal resources in the area. However, Champion wasn't the only western settlement claiming to be the city of the future, and its population peaked at around 650 people. Nevertheless, Champion continued to mature into a stable and close-knit village. The building of the Community Hall in the late 1920s was a particularly important moment in the history of the town, and the Hall continues to host a variety of community social events to this day. Along with agriculture, coal mining was a particularly important economic engine for the area. After the initial discovery of coal by Henry Therriault, a number of mines were established. Between 1906 and 1965, when the last coal mine was shut down, there were 58 registered coal mines in the Champion area. In addition to these, there were numerous mines dug into the river or lake beds by families who used coal to heat their homes. Many farmers worked in the mines in the fall and winter months, when farming work was scarce and there was greater demand for coal to heat homes and businesses. Agriculture remained, however, the most important economic activity for the town and surrounding area. By the mid-1920s there were seven grain elevators, such distinct landmarks for all prairie towns, in Champion. However, as grain handling procedures, as well as world markets, changed throughout the 20th century, Champion's wooden grain elevators, like so many throughout the prairies, became increasingly obsolete. Champion's last elevator was torn down in 2004. Champion's population throughout the years has remained small but active. Sports formed an important part of community life, particularly through the heyday of the Champion Men's baseball team throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Social and cultural clubs such as the Lions Club, the Champion branch of the Royal Canadian Legion, 4-H clubs, Scouts and Girl Guides, and the Pioneer Club, provide the social backbone of the village and surrounding area. Since its founding, the Village of Champion has celebrated its anniversary every five years, traditionally on the July 1st long weekend. In 2011 the town will celebrate its 100th anniversary, an important celebration for which planning has been underway for some years.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Village of Champion recorded a population of 317 living in 164 of its 185 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 378. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, the Village of Champion had a population of 378 living in 159 of its 177 total dwellings, a 3.8% change from its 2006 population of 364. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. The population of the Village of Champion according to its 2007 municipal census is 384.  Government  The village is governed by a council consisting of a mayor and four councillors, and is administrated by a chief administrative officer.  Services  Champion is home to two schools, the Champion Community School (115 students in grades 1-9, plus a parent-run kindergarten), and the Hope Christian School (grades K-12). Recreational and cultural services in the village include the Champion Public Library, the Community Pool (outdoors), the Pioneer Club Seniors' Drop-In Centre, two baseball fields, the Champion Community Park and Campground, the Rodeo arena, the Royal Canadian Legion, and in the winter, a skating arena with natural ice. Retail services and businesses in Champion include a restaurant/bar, a grocery/liquor/lottery store, a self-serve gas station, a thrift store, a bank, a post office, and various other locally owned businesses. In terms of emergency response, the Village of Champion is served by the RCMP detachment and EMS services in neighbouring Vulcan, Alberta, as well as the Champion Volunteer Fire Department. The village is home to several churches, including St. Mary's Catholic Church, the Champion Congregational Church, and a local meetinghouse of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Champion serves as a gateway to Little Bow Provincial Park, which is located 20 kilometres east of the village and provides camping and many other outdoor recreational activities.

They wrote and sang the original version of the song \\"No More \\"I Love You's\\"\\", covered by Annie Lennox in 1995 on her Medusa album, which she took to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. History Freeman and Hughes formed The Lover Speaks in 1985, having previously worked together in the punk outfit The Flys. Deriving their name from the Roland Barthes' book A Lover's Discourse: Fragments, the duo began writing material and also recruited keyboard player Barry Gilbert after advertising for a keyboardist. Although Gilbert was not an official member of the group, he would record and tour with the duo. Later in 1985, the band sent a demo tape to Dave Stewart of Eurythmics and soon signed with Stewart's Anxious Music Publishing. Meanwhile, Stewart had forwarded the demo tape to Chryssie Hynde, who sent it to producer Jimmy Iovine. Iovine was successful in getting the band a recording contract with A&M; Records in early 1986. In July 1986, the band released their debut single, \\"No More \\"I Love You's\\"\\", which peaked at No. 58 in the UK. In August, the band's self-titled debut album, The Lover Speaks, was released. Produced by Iovine, and featuring contributions from Stewart, June Miles-Kingston and Nils Lofgren among others, the album was a commercial failure. In September, the album's second single, \\"Tremble Dancing\\", also failed to enter the charts. The third and final single, \\"Every Lover's Sign\\", was released in October, and in December peaked at No. 6 on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. Following the release of the album, the band opened for Eurythmics during their Revenge World Tour. In February 1987, the band released a cover of Dusty Springfield's I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten as a non-album single. The song failed to chart. The duo, with their live band, had played the song on tour, and although Stewart advised against recording it, he produced the song with the duo. In the spring and summer of 1987, the band returned to the studio to record their second album, The Big Lie. By this time Gilbert had left the band. Iovine, Stewart and Daniel Lanois shared production, however upon completion A&M; Records declined to release it. It was later unofficially released in 1997 as a limited promotional factory-pressed CD. \\"No More \\"I Love You's\\" was re-issued in March 1988, but failed to chart. In July that year, the band played at the Marquee Club in London, and also performed at the Reading Festival in August. The duo split by the end of the year. Freeman went on to release a few solo albums in the 1990s. Collaborations In late 1986, the band worked with Alison Moyet during sessions for her second studio album. The UK No. 2 album Raindancing was released in 1987 and largely produced by Iovine. Moyet and band had worked on three songs together, although the Freeman/Hughes-penned \\"Sleep Like Breathing\\" was the only song to make the album. In September 1987, it was released as the fourth and final single from the album. A duet between Moyet and Freeman, the song reached No. 80 in the UK. The song \\"Take My Imagination to Bed\\", also written by the duo, was released as a B-Side on the 12\\" version of the UK Top 10 single \\"Weak in the Presence of Beauty\\" several months earlier. During the same period, the duo, along with Gilbert, also wrote the song \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\" for Kiki Dee. It was released on her 1987 album Angel Eyes, and released as a single in March 1987.

The game show was recorded at the Ed Sullivan Theater (CBS Studio 50) in New York City and sportscaster Pat Hernon was the announcer.Game Shows '75: Musical Chairs The show was created by Don Kirshner. Musical Chairs aired at 4:00 PM (3:00 Central Time), replacing Tattletales, which had moved to the morning, against NBC's Somerset and ABC's The Money Maze (and later You Don't Say!); it was not successful in the ratings against that competition. Give-n-Take replaced Chairs the following Monday for 4 weeks before Tattletales moved back to 4:00 PM. Usually appearing on each episode were guest singers and musical groups, among them The Tokens, The Spinners, Larry Kert, Margaret Whiting, Sharon Vaughn, The New Christy Minstrels and Sister Sledge as well as up and coming singers and stars such as Alaina Reed, Kelly Garrett, Marilyn Sokol, Jane Olivor, and Irene Cara. Gameplay Four contestants competed, one usually a champion. Three rounds and nine songs were played. A singer (host Wade and/or one of the guest performers) would begin to sing a song, but stop at a certain point. The singer then sang three different lyrics for the next line of the song, only one of which was correct, which were all displayed on back-lit panels. The third panel occasionally contained humorous or absurd lyrics. The incorrect lyrics were written by songwriters/lyricists who were on the show's staff. Songwriter Bruce Sussman was the show's chief writer for its entire run. On occasion, the performers would sing an entire verse and/or chorus and Wade would ask a simple trivia question related to the song, with three possible answers. The players then picked which of the three options s/he thought was correct by pressing a button on their console. For the first question in each round, the first three players to lock in the correct answer won the money for that question. On the second question, only the first two correct answers won the money, and for the third question, only the first correct answer won the money. The questions were worth $50 for the first round, $75 for the second round, and $100 for the third round. However, after each question in the third round, the player with the least money was eliminated from the game, although they did get to keep any winnings up to that point. Changes Later in the run, the first song in each round paid $50 each to the first three players to lock in with the right answer. The second song paid $75 to the first three players to be correct, and the last song paid $100 to the first three players with the correct song line. The player with the lowest score after each round would be eliminated from further play, but kept all winnings up to that point. In the second round, the first two players to lock in the correct answer won money. The third round was played differently than the previous two. Once again, three songs were played with the money paying off to the first player to lock in the correct answer. If the leader rang in first and answered correctly on the third question, the game ended and he/she became the day's champion. If not, another song was played for $100. The game would then continue in this manner until the leader answered one more question or the opponent answered enough questions to overtake the leader. As before, the player with the most money after the final round won the game. Bonus round Originally, the contestant had to name each song that was sung (with the singer humming through any part that uses the song's title, much like the \\"Sing-A-Tune\\" round of Name That Tune). Getting a stated amount in 60 seconds won a bonus prize. Later, the bonus round was dropped and the winning contestant simply had his/her main game total doubled. Beginning in mid-September, a new bonus round was introduced - the day's winner chose one of three categories, then heard the melody of a song. The lyrics were then shown split into ten lines, albeit scrambled and had to be put in the proper order. Each time a line was correctly placed, the contestant won $100. Getting all 10 in the proper places within 30 seconds won $2,000. Episode status The show's status is unknown, as CBS had ceased wiping its daytime games in late 1972. One episode exists with musical guests Irene Cara, soap star Mary Stuart, and the Spinners. A partial audio recording of an episode featuring musical guests Buddy Greco, Hattie Winston and Dick Roman is known to be in the collection of Roman's daughter, Miel. Former contestant Arlene Dittamo uploaded two more episodes to YouTube in October 2017, which originally aired during the show's final week in October 1975. Bobby Rydell, Ernestine Jackson, Ralph Carter, Donna Cellini, Sister Sledge, Larry Kert, and Shari Lewis appear in the episodes.

Initially printed between February and June 2006 as five separate issues, the series was collected as a trade paperback in September 2006. In 2009, it was collected in the Spike Omnibus. Story description A Spike story that takes place over the timespan of a century focusing on the long-running rivalry between Spike and Dracula. Spike vs. Dracula #1 In October 2013, Dracula writes in his journal. He tells of Magda, a Romanian sorceress he had learned of; a powerful woman who was skilled in transfiguration and hypnosis, and could command the very elements. Dracula sought her out, and became her willing pupil. The girls clan was initially wary of him, but quickly realized that having Dracula as a protector had notable benefits. For years he protected the clan, and watched Magda grow old. She constantly refused his offer of the \\"gift\\" of immortality. One night, Dracula visited the clan to find everyone dead. Dracula found Magda's body, and swore revenge on her killer. He saw that she left an image of the attacking vampire clan in a crystal ball: Drusilla, Spike, and Darla. In a London book store, Spike is marveling at a copy of Dracula. He observes that the book contains detailed information on how to kill vampires. Drusilla remarks that it's convenient; Spike argues that it's very inconvenient for them. The shop owner demands eleven pounds for the book, as it is signed by the author. Spike thinks this price is ridiculous, but Drusilla asks for the book, so Spike pays. As they walk the streets of London, Spike tries to convince Drusilla to forget about Angelus; since the incident with the gypsies, he believes, they should consider him gone. Elsewhere, Darla is approached by Dracula. Dracula offers to remove Darla's pain if she'll come with him, and Darla, under Dracula's hypnotic thrall, agrees. Darla takes Dracula back to her townhouse. Dracula is trying to convince Darla to be his bride, when Spike and Dru arrive. Spike confronts Dracula, who is amused by Spike's name. He announces his own name, and Spike produces the novel he had purchased, saying he has a bone to pick. Dracula calls the novel \\"fabricated rubbish,\\" and throws the book into the fireplace. Darla interjects, telling Spike that accepting Dracula as their new leader is a good way to move on after the loss of Angelus. Spike resents the implication that he'd be an inadequate leader, and demands his eleven pounds from Dracula. Dracula begins to take Dru under his thrall, and Spike angrily attacks. Dracula effortlessly grabs Spike by the throat and throws him into the fire. In flames, Spike leaps from the townhouse window and into the nearby Thames. Later, Drusilla and Darla depart in a carriage with Dracula to be his brides, unaware that Spike is hiding beneath the coach. One November night, Dracula summons his brides to him. When they arrive, Drusilla begins to speak of a \\"party\\" and says that many people are coming with unpleasant gifts. Dracula presents the girls with gifts of his own: two wooden stakes. Using his hypnotic powers, he orders them to pick them up, saying that it is the only way to end the pain of losing Angelus. Just as Dracula is ordering the girls to kill each other, a flaming arrow crashes through the window. A mob is raiding Dracula's mansion, and the girls are able to escape. Dracula finds a letter from Spike left in their place, saying that he had attacked the village and led the angry mob to the mansion. He concludes the letter with, \\"P.S.: You still owe me eleven pounds.\\" Spike vs. Dracula #2 In October 1934, Darla reads a letter from Spike. Darla has chosen to remain in Germany while Spike and Drusilla visit America. In the letter, Spike says that they travelled to Los Angeles, where they ran into Dracula, now world-famous as a result of the movie based on him. In L.A., Spike takes Drusilla to a theatre showing a stage version of Dracula starring B√©la Lugosi himself. Drusilla points out that they've met the real Dracula, but Spike argues that Lugosi is far more entertaining. Spike produces two third-row tickets; Drusilla asks if they were expensive, and Spike replies that they cost the original owner his life. In Poughkeepsie, a boy tells his school class about his trip to see B√©la Lugosi in L.A. He had been excited to see the play, even though he didn't realize he'd meet real vampires that night. He insists to his skeptical teacher that the story is true, and continues to explain that he had been seated next to Drusilla. He had spoken with her until his mother told him to \\"leave the nice lady alone.\\" Drusilla remarks to Spike that nobody had ever called her a \\"nice lady\\" before. Spike begins to respond, but is distracted when he sees that Dracula himself is sitting in the audience. Spike watches him closely as he sits, unmoving, throughout the production. After the show, Dracula goes to Lugosi's dressing room and attacks him. Spike intervenes as Dracula prepares to kill the \\"imposter,\\" and Dracula transforms into a wolf and attacks him. They crash out the window and into the alley below while Lugosi escapes his dressing room, yelling for help. He comes across a bride of Dracula, who intends to drive a stake through Lugosi's heart. Before she can do so, Drusilla interferes, taking the stake and killing the vampire. In the alley, Dracula morphs into a giant bat and takes off, but Spike grabs hold of his leg. They fly onto the set of an aviation film, and land on the wings of an airborne biplane. Dracula's cape gets caught in the plane's propeller, and the plane crashes into the Hollywoodland Sign, destroying the final four letters, as Spike kills the pilot and uses his parachute to escape safely. At the theatre, Drusilla is preparing to turn Lugosi into a vampire when the boy from the third row attacks her with a cross and chases her away. Later, he is being forced by his schoolteacher to write lines on the blackboard promising never to tell monster stories again. The boy, Edward Wood, Junior, pledges to one day make monster movies as he leaves, taking his teacher's angora sweater with him. Spike vs. Dracula #3 In September 1943, a worried Spike writes a letter to Darla. She has not replied to a letter in some time, so Spike intends to travel to Berlin to find her. He is stopped by a Nazi officer, kills him, and steals his uniform. He enters Darla's apartment, and comes face to face with Dracula, who has been waiting for him. Dracula tells Spike that Darla was taken by a special branch of the secret police that specializes in all things mystical. The same group has taken one of Dracula's brides, a vampiric gypsy woman by the name of Anselina. Dracula had come to the apartment for Darla's assistance in recovering his bride, but was too late. Dracula says that he knows where the women are, but will need help to rescue them. Faced with a common enemy, Spike and Dracula forge an alliance. Dracula and Spike, still in his officer's attire, approach the Nazi stronghold in a car. They pull the gate guard into the vehicle and coerce him into inviting them into the compound. Spike rams the car through the gates amid machine gun fire from the other guards. A bullet-ridden Spike emerges from the car and attacks. Suddenly, Nazi reinforcements arrive, this time carrying crosses. Spike curses Dracula and the novel that told everyone how to kill vampires, and retreats to a nearby building. Inside, he finds a chained-up werewolf wearing dog tags identifying him as an American soldier by the name of Nathaniel Osborne. Spike frees the werewolf as the soldiers burst in, and escapes in the ensuing chaos. Outside, he sees that Dracula has assumed the form of a giant bat, and is flying off with Darla and Anselina. Betrayed, Spike steals a Nazi motorcycle and sets off. Back at Darla's apartment, Spike finds a letter from Darla. She has departed for London, while Dracula and his bride have set off for Romania. The letter assures Spike that he will be attended to. Just then, Nostroyev and The Prince of Lies arrive. They explain that Dracula disapproves of what the Nazis have done to his gypsy kin, and so has sent operatives to Berlin on a mission. They are to depart for Madrid, where the Count assures them there will be free virgin blood for all to share. Spike decides to depart with the two vampires. In a Nazi office, Dracula assures Adolf Hitler that the three vampires suspect nothing. Darla and Anselina had been used as bait so that the Nazis could capture who Dracula describes as the three most formidable vampires, save for himself. In return, Hitler promises to release Dracula's favoured gypsy tribes. Spike vs. Dracula #4 In June 1959, Spike writes a letter to Darla, who has rejoined The Master. Spike and Drusilla are living in post-war Rome, and enjoying themselves immensely. Spike leaves Dru briefly to find someone to eat, but when he returns she is gone. A friend of Spike's says that she left with \\"Le Comte.\\" Assuming he means Dracula, Spike takes off to find her, but is drugged and captured by a group of demons. The drug wears off before they reach their destination, and Spike escapes from the trunk of the car transporting him. The demons chase him into the Colosseum, where he attacks and kills them one by one. Spike interrogates the final demon to learn where the Count is keeping Drusilla, but the demon says he has flown to Cyprus. Spike forces the demon to drive him to the airport, and hitches a ride on a statue of Dracula that is being airlifted to the Count's private villa, taking the demon with him. Spike throws the demon from the statue shortly before they land at Cyprus, and disembarks in the villa, which is filled with statues. Inside he finds Drusilla, playing a harpsichord. Spike angrily scolds Dru for running off with their enemy, and demands to know where the Count is. He enters at that moment, revealing himself to be not Dracula, but Comte de Saint-Germain, who Spike has never met. The Count says it's his two-hundredth birthday, and had invited Drusilla along for company. He had hired the demons to treat Spike to a night of drinks and a midnight swim with Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren as payment for the \\"borrowing\\" of Drusilla. The Count invites a disappointed Spike to remain and listen to music played by himself and Drusilla. Afterwards, the Count shows Spike and Dru to his private airstrip, promising to have them back in Rome before sunrise. Dru thanks Spike for not killing Saint-Germain, and Spike smashes the statue of Dracula as retribution for the inconvenience of being kidnapped. As they leave, Spike wishes he could do that to the real Dracula one day. Behind them, mist emerges from the broken statue and Dracula solidifies inside, behind the Count's back. He has been imprisoned by the Count for twelve years, and he is finally able to take his revenge. Spike vs. Dracula #5 In November 2003, the Los Angeles branch of Wolfram & Hart receives a letter from Count Vlad Dracula. Dracula lost a $2.7 million mansion when Sunnydale was destroyed, and the firm has not replied to Dracula's inquiries, so he intends to pay a personal visit. At Wolfram and Hart, Spike is ecstatic when he hears of Dracula's impending visit. He begs Angel to let Dracula believe that Spike's incorporeal form is not bound to the W&H; offices, and therefore can haunt Dracula for eternity. Angel agrees to let Spike torment Dracula, on the condition that Spike leave Angel alone for a full month. Dracula arrives and meets with Angel, where they discuss the difficulties of Dracula's case. The insurance company hasn't classified the city's destruction of Sunnydale as an earthquake, and so he has no coverage. As Dracula demands to know the true cause of Sunnydale's collapse, Spike appears in a chair behind him. Dracula lunges for Spike immediately, passing right through him and tumbling to the floor. Spike demands the eleven pounds Dracula owes him, and taunts Dracula with the fact that both he and Angel have slept with Buffy. He goes on to mention that Angel killed a gypsy girl in a clan Dracula had been fond of a century ago, leading to the slaughter of the entire clan. An enraged Dracula throws Angel through his office door and into the lobby. Dracula morphs into a wolf and attacks Angel, but is thrown into the doors of the elevator, where Knox and Fred are standing. Dracula changes to his mist form and rematerializes behind the two, tossing Knox aside and taking Fred hostage. Spike makes the mistake of saying that Fred is the only one who can make him solid again, and Dracula prepares to kill her on the spot. Spike, however, threatens to haunt Dracula forever if he does so, and Dracula releases her. Dracula sneers that Spike is common and unworthy, and asks who was responsible for his creation. Upon discovering that it's Angel, Dracula decides that he is a far more worthy enemy. He formally apologizes to Fred for the hostage situation, and announces that he will be seeking other legal representation. He tells Spike that the business between the two of them is concluded, and tells Angel that 'their' business has only just begun. He then vanishes in a cloud of mist. Spike is furious at Angel for \\"stealing\\" his nemesis, and Angel replies that there's always The Immortal. Spike exclaims that The Immortal is also Angel's nemesis, and that Dracula is far more famous. Dracula is riding in the back of his limousine when Spike emerges from the steering column, startling the driver. The car crashes, and Spike tells Dracula that when the police arrive, they'll drag him out into the sun. He orders Dracula to admit that Spike is his nemesis, but Dracula escapes into the sewer. That night, Spike meets Dracula as he emerges from a manhole. He demands his eleven pounds, which is compensation for a copy of Dracula that Vlad had burned a hundred years ago. Dracula sneers that not only did Spike pay a ridiculous sum for the book at the time, but now that he is demanding compensation he is failing to consider the value of the book today, or even the effect of inflation on the original price. Spike says he doesn't care about any of that, he just wants what's his. He had only bought the book because Drusilla wanted it. Dracula smiles and says that \\"love makes fools of us all.\\" He produces twenty American dollars - the equivalent of eleven British pounds - and throws it to the street. He then transforms into a bat and flies away as Spike mocks him. As Spike gloats about being the winner, he reaches down to pick up the money, and his hand passes right through it.

Any notable distinctions that may exist between versions are noted with the individual entry it applies to. A * Abstract - An indicator applied to a classifier (e.g., actor, class, use case) or to some features of a classifier (e.g., a class's operations) showing that the feature is incomplete and is intended not to be instantiated, but to be specialized by other definitions. * Abstract class - A class that does not provide a complete declaration, perhaps because it has no implementation method identified for an operation. By declaring a class as abstract, one intends to prohibit direct instantiation of the class. An abstract class cannot directly instantiate objects; it must be inherited from before it can be used. *Abstract data type * Abstract operation - Unlike attributes, class operations can be abstract, meaning that there is no provided implementation. Generally, a class containing an abstract operation should be marked as an abstract class. An Operation must have a method supplied in some specialized Class before it can be used. * Abstraction is the process of picking out common features and deriving essential characteristics from objects and procedure entities that distinguish it from other kinds of entities. * Action - An action is the fundamental unit of behaviour specification and represents some transformation or processing in the modeled system, such as invoking a method of a class or a sub activity * Action sequence - * Action state - * Action steps - * Activation - the time during which an object has a method executing. It is often indicated by a thin box or bar superimposed on the Object's lifeline in a Sequence Diagram * Activity diagram - a diagram that describes procedural logic, business process or work flow. An activity diagram contains a number of Activities and connected by Control Flows and Object Flows. * Active class - a class defining active objects * Active object - an object running under its own thread * Activity - carrying out behaviour in a State machine diagram ** Do - a type of Activity which may be interrupted, as opposed to normal Activities which may not be interrupted ** Internal - an Activity that is executed within a State *** Entry - an Activity that is executed when a State is entered *** Exit - an Activity that is executed when a State is exited * Activity final - the end point of an activity diagram. When a thread reaches an Activity Final node, all the threads of the activity terminate. (Contrast with Flow Final node, which marks the end of one thread.) * Actor - a role that a user takes when invoking a use case. Also see actor modeling. * Aggregation - 1. a special type of association used to represent a stronger relationship between two classes than a regular association; typically read as \\"owns a\\", as in, \\"Class A owns a Class B\\". A hierarchy of classes where the child object may or may not continue to exist if the parent object is destroyed; see 'composition'. 2. An aggregation is a structural relationship that specifies that one class represents a large thing which constitute of smaller things and represents \\"has-a\\" relationship. * Artifact - items that model physical pieces of information in your system, such as a user's manual, training material, or password file * Association - 1. a relationship with 2 or more ends, where each end is on a class (or other classifier). Each end is called a Role, and may have a role name, Multiplicity, and may be Navigable. 2. An association is a structural relationship that specifies that the objects of one thing are connected with the objects of another. * Association class - a class that describes an association. * Asynchronous - The sender of an asynchronous message does not wait for a response. * Attribute - a significant piece of data owned by a Class, often containing values describing each instance of the class. Besides the attribute name and a slot for the attribute value, an attribute may have specified Visibility, Type, Multiplicity, Default value, and Property-string. B * Block - Block is a place where all the aggregates are collected at one place * BPM - Business Process Model, is used to define the process followed by the business. It is a high level design for the business process. * BPMN - Business Process Modelling Notations, are used to define the process on paper with the help of predefined shapes of UML. C * Call - * Cardinality - the current number of occurrences of a Property. The cardinality must be a value that is allowed by the multiplicity * Child - * Class - the primary declarative construct of Object-Oriented Programming; a cohesive unit of Attributes and Operations; a compile-time template for an Object * Class diagram - a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes and the relationships between the classes. * Classifier - a category of UML elements that have some common features, such as attributes or methods. * Client - * Collaboration - A collaboration is a society of classes, interfaces and other elements that work together to provide some cooperative behavior that is bigger than the sum of its parts. * Communication diagram * Component - A component represents a software module (source code, binary code, executable, DLL, etc.) with a well-defined interface. The interface of a component is represented by one or several interface elements that the component provides. Components are used to show compiler and run-time dependencies, as well as interface and calling dependencies among software modules. They also show which components implement a specific class. * Component diagram * Composite structure diagram * Composition - a specific type of relationship describing how one Object is composed of another Object; a form of Aggregation where the child object is destroyed if the parent object is destroyed. * Condition - * Connection - * Constraint - natural language, programming language or Object Constraint Language boolean condition which may not be false if a Class is to be considered valid * Containment - containment by value and containment by reference. Containment by value implies that an object contains another object; containment by reference implies that an object contains a pointer to another object. D * Decision - a point in an Activity diagram where a Flow splits into several, mutually exclusive, Guarded flows. A Merge marks the end of the optional behaviour started by the Decision * Dependency - a dependency exists between two defined elements if a change to the definition of one would result in a change to the other. In UML this is indicated by a line pointing from the dependent to the independent element. * Deployment diagram * Derived property - a property that can be calculated or inferred from other properties * Diagram - a visual representation of a subset of features of a UML Model * Directed relationship - * Domain - a logical grouping that explicitly declares a rule which defines ownership of objects based upon some type or property. E * Edge - a synonym for Flow * Encapsulation - a means to bind together code and the data it uses. It is the basis of object oriented programming. * Entity - * Enumeration - a set of constant values for a new data type * Event - when it occurs on an Object it may cause a Transition in a State machine diagram * Expansion region - a set of Actions in an Activity diagram that occur once for each of a collection of input Tokens to the Expansion Region * Extend - a means to use a class as a starting point for creation of a new class. The new class inherits all of the attributes, properties, and methods of the class it extends. * Exception - F * File - * Final state - the state at which an object ceases to exist * Flow - a navigational connection between two Actions * Flow Final - the point at which a Flow ends without ending the complete Activity * Fork - a point in an Activity diagram where a Flow of logic splits into several concurrent Flows (Threads) * Found Message - starting point for a Sequence diagram G * Generalization - a relationship between a specific classifier (typically a class) to a more general classifier asserting that the general classifer contains common features among both the specific classifier and the general classifier. Features include, for example, properties, and constraints. The use of generalization is often logically restricted to cases where the specific classifier is a \\"kind-of\\" or \\"sort-of\\" the general classifier: for example, a Boxer is a \\"kind-of\\" Dog. When the classifiers involved are software engineering classes, generalization usually involves reusing code; it is often implemented using inheritance, where the more specific code reuses the more general code. * Generalization Tree - Several specialized classifiers may point to the same general classifier, forming a generalization tree, where the general classifer contains common features shared by all the specialized versions. As generalization is a relationship, it is possible for a classifer to participate in several generalizations, often being on the specific end or on the general end, forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) (i.e., no loops). * Generic - * Guard - a boolean test that must be satisfied for a Flow of an activity diagram or a Transition of a state machine diagram to be allowed to start H * Hierarchy - * History pseudostate - points to the initial state of an object where no previous state history was saved I * Inheritance - where a new more specific Class derives part of its definition from an existing more general Class * Initial node - the start point of an Activity diagram * Initial pseudostate - points to the initial State of an Object * Instance - An instance is a concrete manifestation of an abstraction to which a set of operations can be applied and which has a state that stores the effect of the operation. * Interaction diagram * Interaction overview diagram * Interaction Frame - a section of a Sequence diagram, divided into fragments, which is subject to an algorithmic Operator such as iteration, parallelism or optionality. * Interface - a defined communication boundary. J * Join - a point in an activity diagram where several concurrent flows (threads) synchronize, waiting until all are complete before continuing with a single flow L * Lifeline - indicates a participating Object or Part in a Sequence diagram. The Lifeline may show activation, Object creation, and Object deletion. * Link - a relationship between objects. While an Object is an instantiation of a Class a Link can be seen as an instantiation of an Association. M * Merge - a point in an Activity diagram marking the end of the optional behavior started by a Decision * Message - a signal from one object (or similar entity) to another, often with parameters. Often implemented as a call to a Method, including the Constructor and Destructor, of an Object in a Sequence diagram. * Metadata - * Metamodel - * Metamodeling - * Metamodeling technique - * Meta-Object Facility - * Method - * Modeling - ** Domain - the representation of real world conceptual entities ** Design - the representation of software Classes and Interfaces ** Dynamic - use of Interaction diagrams to describe collaborations and behavior * model - * Model-driven architecture (MDA) - * Multiplicity - 1. A specification of the number of possible occurrences of a property, or the number of allowable elements that may participate in a given relationship. In UML 1.x, it was also possible to have a discrete list of values, but this was eliminated in UML 2.0. 2. It specifies how many objects may be connected across an instance of an association which is written as a range of values (like 1..*). ** Mandatory - A required multiplicity, the lower bound is at least one, usually 1..1 or 1 ** Optional - The lower bound is at most zero, usually, 0..1 ** Many - A multiplicity with no upper limit, either 0..* or * ** Forbidden - No elements allowed, 0..0 (in UML 2.2) N * Namespace - a context in which an identifier exists. * Navigable - the ability for objects of a Class at one end of an Association to retrieve Objects from the other end. Associations need not be navigable. * Node - * Note - It is an explanatory part of UML models. A note is a symbol for rendering constraints and comments attached to an element or collection of elements. O * Object - a runtime instance of a Class. Objects are rarely shown on diagrams (because there are usually too many) unless they are used to illustrate some scenario, test, etc. Such Objects are often shown with the Attributes of the Class populated with sample data * Object Constraint Language (OCL) - a declarative language for describing rules and constraints that apply to UML models * Object diagram * Operation - the signature of a Method of a Class; consists of the Operation Name, Visibility, Parameter list, Return Type, and Property-string * Operator - an algorithmic feature of Interaction Frame that defines the behavior of that frame. Examples include: ** alt - multiple alternatives each with a guard condition. Only one alternative can be true. ** critical - a fragment within a larger parallel Interaction Frame that when entered suspends the interleaving of events from the other fragments. ** loop - the fragment iterates according to a guard condition. ** neg - an invalid interaction. ** opt - single alternative with a guard condition. ** par - each fragment is run in parallel. ** ref - an interaction defined in another diagram. ** strict - a fragment with the ordering of reception events across multiple lifelines follow strictly their graphical arrangement. P * Package - A package is a collection or grouping of related classes or of classes with related functionality. * Package diagram * Parameter - data passed in a Message to be used within the Method * Partition - section of an Activity diagram or Sequence diagram occupied by a single Class or Object * Pin - a parameter of an Action * Polymorphism - the ability of Objects belonging to different Classes to respond to Operations of the same name, each one according to the right Class-specific behaviour * Profile - Provides a generic extension mechanism for building UML models. Other extension mechanisms include stereotypes. * Property - an Attribute or an Association * Property-string - a qualifier for Attributes and Operations. Examples include {ordered}, {readonly}, {unique}. Q * Qualified association - tightens the multiplicity or role of an association between 2 classes by dividing the set of objects into subsets based on a value of the qualifier‚Äîan attribute of the target objects, association objects, or some a derived attribute of the target or association objects. R * Realization - Realization shows the relationship between an Interface and the class that provides the implementation for the interface. * Reference - * Request - The input to the system for finding the related abstracts from different operations (Add, Del, Mod, Inq.). Request could be for only one for every operation * Response - The output of the \\"Request\\". Response could be 1 or more for a single request. * Relation - * Return - a reply that may be issued from a Method following a Message * Role - description of the part played in an Association by one of the Classes in the Association S * Scenario - a narrative describing foreseeable interactions * Self-call - a Message from an Object to one of its own Methods * Sequence diagram - describes the Messages sent between a number of participating Objects in a Scenario * Signal - an Event which can occur in an Activity diagram in three different ways: as a Time Signal, as a signal which an Activity can listen for and a signal which an Activity can send * State - an Object exists at one of the States described in a State machine diagram. A state encompasses all the properties of the object along with the values of each of these properties. * State diagram - synonym for State machine diagram * State machine diagram - describes the lifetime behaviour of a single Object in terms of in which State it exists and the Transition between those States * Static attribute - an attribute that does not relate to a specific object but is at class level; that is, an attribute that is common among all objects of that class * Static modeling - use of class diagrams to describe structure * Static operation - an operation that does not relate to a specific object but is at class level * Stereotype - a notation allowing the extension of UML symbols. Some are defined within Profiles. Examples of predefined UML stereotypes are Actor, Exception, Powertype and Utility. * Structure diagram * Superstate - construct allowing several States which share common Transitions and Internal Activities * Swim lane - synonym for Partition * System model - The logical UML model being represented through one or more UML diagrams T * Tagged values - In extensibility * Template - a Class that accepts a compile-time parameter defining the Type to be used within the Class; often to implement Collections of any Type * Thread - a sequence of instructions whose execution is being scheduled by the Operating System and may run in parallel with other threads * Timing Diagram * Token - symbolises the Thread of an Activity diagram * Transition - 1. movement from one State to another in a State machine diagram. The transition is specified by its Trigger-signature [Guard]/Activity 2. a relationship between two states indicating that when a specific event occurs and specific conditions are satisfied an object in the first state will perform certain actions and enter the second state. * Type - the options are: an elementary Value type such as integer, string, date, or Boolean or a Reference type defined in a Class U * Use case - A use case can be defined as a sequence of actions, including variations, that the system can execute and that produce an observable result which has some value for an actor that interacts with the system * Use case diagram * Uses dependency - V * Visibility - the availability for access of elements in a model. Typically used to limit the visibility of features defined by a Class (e.g., attributes, operations). When applied to features defined by a class, the standard options are: ** private (-): available only within the Class in which it was defined. This is the most limited visibility ** protected (#): available within any subclass of this class and within the package which directly contains the defining Class ** package (~): available only within the Package which directly contains the defining Class ** public (+): available to any Class that can see the defining Class. This is the least limited visibility.

In 1965, against the advice of his viticultural professors at the University of California, Davis, David Lett moved to Oregon to plant Pinot noir] in the Willamette Valley. David and Diana Lett produced the first Pinot noir in the Willamette Valley, and the first Pinot gris in the United States. Their first vintage in 1970. The 1975 Eyrie Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir placed in top ten among Pinot noirs in blind tasting at the Wine Olympics in 1979. Burgundy winemaker Robert Drouhin organized a re-match at Maison Joseph Drouhin in France. The 1975 Eyrie Vineyards Reserve came in second, losing to Drouhin's 1959 Chambolle-Musigny by only two-tenths of a point. Drouhin later purchased land in Oregon and built Domaine Drouhin Oregon. Over the years, David Lett (known locally as \\"Papa Pinot\\") maintained a light-handed style of Pinot noir that did not follow the trend toward greater flavor, tannin, and color extraction, believing color not to be an indicator of quality in Pinot noir. This put him at odds with some of the wine critics. David Lett died on October 9, 2008. David and Diana's son Jason Lett is now president and winemaker for the winery. The Eyrie Vineyards estate vineyards are part of the sub-American Viticultural Area (AVA) of Willamette Valley AVA known as the Dundee Hills. The winery itself is in McMinnville, which annually hosts the International Pinot Noir Celebration on the last weekend in July on the campus of Linfield College.

In the book Diplomacy in a Globalizing World: Theories and Practices, the authors define nation branding as ‚Äúthe application of corporate marketing concepts and techniques to countries, in the interests of enhancing their reputation in international relations.‚Äù Many nations try to make brands in order to build relationships between different actors that are not restricted to nations. It extends to public and private sectors in a nation and helps with nationalism. States also want to participate in multilateral projects. Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state \\"and the successful transference of this image to its exports - is just as important as what they actually produce and sell.\\"This is also referred to as country-of-origin effect. Nation branding is a developing field in which scholars continue their search for a unified theoretical framework. Many nations aim to improve their country's standing, as the image and reputation of a nation can dramatically influence its economic vitality. They seek to attract tourism and investment capital, increase exports, attract a talented and creative workforce, and enhance their cultural and political influence in the world. Different ways that nation project their nation brand include export, foreign direct investment, and tourism. One example of exporting products is that the country Germany is known for their motor industry because famous car companies like Mercedes, Audi, and BMW are German companies. An example of foreign direct investments that help the nation brand are US companies building maquiladoras and other European countries having factories in different countries. In practice  Nation branding appears to be practiced by many countries, including the United States, Canada, France, United Kingdom (where it is officially referred to as public diplomacy), Taiwan, Malaysia, Japan, China, South Korea, Singapore, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and most Western European countries. An early example of this was the Cool Britannia approach of the early days of the New Labour government (following the Britain (TM) pamphlet by Demos's Mark Leonard), though this has since been replaced by a more credible Public Diplomacy Board. Cool Japan is a newer initiative aimed at promoting Japan's creative industries. There is increasing interest in the concept from poorer states on the grounds that an enhanced image might create more favorable conditions for foreign direct investment, tourism, trade and even political relations with other states. Developing nations such as Tanzania, Colombia and Peru are creating smaller nation branding programs aimed at increased overall image and with the case of Colombia, changing international perception. Nation branding is seen as a part of Sweden's public diplomacy, especially with Brand Sweden. Sweden uses two main institutions, called the Utrikesdepartementet and the Swedish Institute, to study their nation branding. They wanted to present a good image through the press and also collect different reports on Sweden‚Äôs representations abroad. Different events and campaigns were also made to promote Brand Sweden, one example being the House of Sweden which was an embassy in the US. Another campaign was the Second House of Sweden which used the internet to introduce Sweden‚Äôs embassy virtually. Researchers in Sweden also studied the Nation Brand Index (NBI) results to collect data. In academia Nation branding can be approached in academics as a field in social sciences, political sciences, humanities, communication, marketing and international relations. Scholars such as Evan H. Potter at the University of Ottawa have conceptualized nation brands as a form of national soft power. All efforts by government (at any level) to support the nation brand - either directly or indirectly - becomes public diplomacy. Anti-globalisation proponents often claim that globalisation diminishes and threatens local diversity, but there is evidence that in order to compete against the backdrop of global cultural homogeneity, nations strive to accentuate and promote local distinctiveness as a competitive advantage. Indexing= Nation Brands Index  The concept of measuring global perceptions of countries across several dimensions (culture, governance, people, exports, tourism, investment and immigration) was developed by Simon Anholt. His original survey, the Anholt Nation Brands Index, was launched in 2005 and fielded four times a year. Today it is fielded and published once a year in partnership with GfK, named the Anholt-GfK Nation Brands Index, using a panel of 20,000 people in 20 countries to monitor the global perceptions of countries. There is also an Anholt-GfK Roper City Brands Index. Nation Brands Index 2011 releasedNation Brands Index 2010 released Brand Finance Nation Brands and Global Soft Power Index Brand Finance produces an annual Brand Finance Nation Brands table, in which 100 brands are ranked according to national brand value. This is based on the royalty relief methodology and takes into account the brand strength of individual countries. Brand Finance also produces an annual Global Soft Power Index assessing national strengths and weakness in terms of their familiarity, influence and reputation around the world. 60 nations were ranked in 2020. Futurebrand Country Brand Index Futurebrand publishes the Country Brand Index every year, which includes an overall ranking of the 75 countries and rankings by dimension, FutureBrand collected quantitative and qualitative data from Approximately 2,500 opinion-formers and frequent international business or leisure travellers in 17 countries (USA, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, UK, Germany, France, Russia, Turkey, South Africa, UAE, India, China, Thailand, Japan and Australia). complete perception dashboards for the top five country brands, regional leaders, and 'ones to watch' for the future. Futurebrand tests a global research sample based on the Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM) which involves determining an individual's awareness, familiarity, association, and preference towards a country's brand. In their 2018-19 ranking, the top 5 nations brands were (ranked from first to fifth) Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Sweden, and Canada.http://www.futurebrand.com/uploads/CBI-18_19-LR.pdf  Digital Country Brand Index  Every year Bloom Consulting and D2 Digital Demand publishes Digital Country Brand Index which measure the digital appeal of country.

IFA produced bicycles, motorcycles, light commercial vehicles, automobiles, vans and heavy trucks. All East German vehicle manufacturers were part of the IFA, including Barkas, EMW (which made Wartburg cars), IWL, MZ, Multicar, Robur, Sachsenring (which made Trabant cars) and Simson. Car production IFA cars were based on pre-war DKW designs and made in the former Horch factory in Zwickau. The F8 had a two-cylinder engine, and the F9 had a three-cylinder unit. The F8 bodies were straight copies of the pre-war models, and rapidly looked old-fashioned, but some had more modern coachwork by Baur of Stuttgart, then in West Germany. The three cylinder cars (F9) had not got into production before war broke out in 1939, and so had more up to date bodies similar to the West German DKWs. More than 26,000 F8's and 30,000 F9s were built. IWL produced W50 and L60 trucks and Robur light trucks and vans. The IFA badge was dropped from cars in 1956, and the F8s became Zwickau P70s, and the F9 was rebodied to become the Wartburg and production transferred to Eisenach.

It was led by Union Army Col. Abel Streight and opposed by Confederate Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. Streight's goal was to destroy parts of the Western and Atlantic Railroad, which was supplying the Confederate Army of Tennessee. The raid was poorly supplied and planned, and ended with the defeat of Streight and his 1,700 men at Cedar Bluff, Alabama, by Forrest who bluffed his opponent into surrendering to his 500 men.\\"Streight's Raid\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama website. Accessed July 10, 2015. Streight was additionally hindered by locals throughout his march, while pursued by Forrest, who had the advantage of home territory and the sympathy and aid of the local populace, most famously Emma Sansom. Raid The actual capture of Streight's forces was achieved by a clever ruse, when Forrest paraded his much smaller force back and forth in front of Streight, convincing him that he was opposed by a superior force. After surrendering and being informed of the deception Streight reputedly demanded his arms back for a proper fight, a request cheerfully declined by Forrest. This unsuccessful raid was coordinated with the more famous Grierson's Raid, partially as a feint to confuse the Confederate forces. Union losses were 12 killed, 69 wounded, and 1,466 captured, for a total of 1,547. Chronology of events of Streight's Raid in 1863 Nathan B.

It is a problem encountered particularly in radio transceivers and older vacuum tube audio systems, guitar amplifiers, PA systems and is caused by some type of unwanted feedback in the circuit. The amplifying devices in audio and radio equipment are vulnerable to a variety of feedback problems, which can cause distinctive noise in the output. The term motorboating is applied to oscillations whose frequency is below the range of hearing, from 1 to 10 hertz, so the individual oscillations are heard as pulses. Sometimes the oscillations can even be seen visually as the woofer cones in speakers slowly moving in and out. Besides sounding annoying, motorboating can cause clipping of the audio output waveform, and thus distortion in the output. Occurrence Although low frequency parasitic oscillations in audio equipment may be due to a range of causes, there are a few types of equipment in which it is frequently seen: *Older audio amplifiers with capacitive (RC) or inductive (transformer) coupling between stages.The problem was common in the early days of radio: This design is mostly used in vacuum tube (valve) equipment. Motorboating was a problem throughout the era of vacuum tube electronics but became rare as vacuum tube gear was replaced in the 1970s with modern solid state designs, which are direct-coupled. The recent resurgence in popularity of traditional tube-type audio equipment in guitar amplifiers and home audio systems has led to a reappearance of motorboating problems. The problem is sometimes caused in older equipment by the evaporation of the electrolyte from old-style \\"wet\\" electrolytic capacitors used in the power circuits of legacy equipment, or in equipment of any age where an amplifier stage is sensitive to feedback via power supply rails, and can be remedied by replacing/upgrading the capacitors. *In both old and new designs, even mostly directly-coupled operational amplifier circuits, feedback through the power supply rails can generate ultrasonic oscillations that vary in amplitude at a low frequency (squegging) due to the power supply voltage sagging as oscillations build up (the long time constant coming from the power supply reservoir capacitor) in such a way that the low frequency is audible even though the high frequency fundamental is not. Such problems can be difficult to diagnose.Help Troubleshooting Old TransmitterEL34 PP motorboating questions *Audio equipment associated with radio transmitters, particularly transceivers in two way radios, such as Citizens band, FRS, which have automatic gain control (AGC) or squelch noise control. Malfunctions in the AGC or squelch circuits, which have long time constants, can cause low frequency oscillation. Another possible cause, sometimes in combination with the first, is leakage of the strong radio frequency (RF) signal from the transmitter into the receiver audio sections, which can cause quenching oscillations. This is a RFI problem, caused by inadequate shielding or filtering to keep the RF out. Theory As with all electronic oscillation, motorboating occurs when some of the output energy from an amplifying device like a transistor or vacuum tube gets coupled back into the input circuit of the device (or possibly into an earlier stage of the amplifier circuit) with the proper phase for positive feedback. This indicates there is an unwanted feedback path through the circuit from output to input of an amplifying stage. The technical conditions for oscillation, given by the Barkhausen stability criterion, are that the total gain around the feedback loop (comprising the amplifying device and the feedback path) at the oscillation frequency must be one (0 dB), and that the phase shift must be a multiple of 360¬∞ (2œÄ radians). Since most amplifying devices, transistors and tubes, are inverting, with the output signal 180¬∞ opposite in phase from the input, the feedback path must contribute the other 180¬∞ of shift. Many types of parasitic oscillation are caused by small interelectrode capacitances (parasitic capacitance) or mutual inductance between adjacent wires or electronic components on the circuit board, which create an inadvertent feedback path. However these usually cause oscillations of high frequency, at the upper end of or above the passband of the equipment. This is because the phase shift of the small reactances in the feedback path, which increases with frequency, only become significant at high frequencies. Low frequency oscillations like motorboating indicate that some device or circuit with a large time constant is involved, such as the interstage coupling capacitors or transformers, or the filter capacitors and supply transformer winding. In vacuum tube circuits, a common cause is feedback through the plate power supply circuit. The power supply provides DC current to each tube's plate circuit, so the power supply wiring (power busses) can be an inadvertent feedback path between stages. The increasing impedance of the filter capacitors at low frequencies can mean that low frequency swings in the current drawn by output stages can cause voltage swings in the power supply voltage which feed back to earlier stages, making the system a subaudio oscillator. This is caused by inadequate power supply filtering or decoupling. The electrolytic capacitors used in equipment of 1960s vintage contained liquid electrolyte, which dried out over decades, decreasing the capacitance and increasing the leakage current, and these are often the cause. One solution suggested is a \\"capacitor job\\", replacing all the old electrolytic capacitors. A more radical but comprehensive solution is to add modern IC voltage regulators, or replace the entire power supply with a modern regulated one. In radio equipment In equipment that includes radio transmitters, motorboating can be caused by radio frequency interference (RFI), the strong radio signal from the transmitter getting into audio or receiver circuits. Receiver audio circuits with automatic gain control (AGC) have a long time constant feedback loop which adjusts the gain of the audio stage to compensate for differences in audio level from causes like different speaking voices. Squelch circuits used in two-way radios to cut out noise similarly have a feedback loop which turns off the audio when high frequency noise is detected. If the inaudible radio frequency (RF) transmitter signal is inadvertently coupled into the receiver's audio signal path, it can trigger the AGC or squelch circuit to reduce the gain. Then, after a delay time set by the circuit's time constant, the circuit increases the gain again until the amplitude of the radio signal triggers another gain reduction. This repetitive cycle is heard as motorboating. An example might be a 27 MHz Citizen's band radio in a car, connected to the car's 12 volt DC supply. If the decoupling capacitors which bypass radio noise from the power supply wires are missing or inadequate, or the long power leads pick up excessive RF from the antenna then it is possible for the RF transmitter signal to enter the radio's receiving circuits through the supply wires. This then causes the motorboating to occur.

It is known for being the first British CGI movie, and was made on a series of relatively simple programs on an Apple Mac, hence the overly primitive animation and unrefined graphics. Overview As of 2006, Dominator is in its fourth incarnation, but the series is currently in hiatus for an unknown amount of time. It originally appeared in a short-lived run in the music magazine Metal Hammer in 1988, with black and white artwork, and plots that often involved the leading rock stars of the time. After a hiatus following the end of its original run, Dominator was resurrected in 1993 as the first ever Brit-created manga series printed in \\"Kodansha Comic Afternoon\\", still drawn by Luke, and now boasting scripts by Alan Grant. In 2003 the comic was adapted as an animated film by Luke's Renga Media, and two further short films followed in 2004 and 2005: namely A Brief History of Hell and Heavy Metal vs Dominator, the latter of which was a crossover with characters from the Heavy Metal universe. As of late 2006, Renga Media revealed Dominator X, which was going to be an entirely new revamp for the series. This bigger-budget remake was going to run as a manga illustrated by Masanori Shino, as well as a downloadable series and film. Dominator X was slated for a release in 2007, and eventually 2008, but it was confirmed that the project was canceled due to financing conflicts. Renga Media has since liquidated, but its staff now work at Renegade Arts Entertainment, established by Tony Luke. Film story Lord Desecrater has defeated Lucifer as the ruler of Hell, but Desecrater's general, Dominator, has rebelled and stolen the Key to Hell to prevent Desecrater gaining control of the realm. On Earth, the daughters of an exorcist by the name of Dr. Payne accidentally summon Dominator to Earth by playing the forbidden Lost Chord. Dominator is soon followed by three of Lord Desecrater's soldiers; Decimator, Extricator, and his former lover, Lady Violator. Dominator must prevent Lord Desecrater coming to Earth at all costs, while battling the many demons that are emerging from the hole that has been torn between the two realms. Concept Dominator was initially supposed to be a downloadable series made on Apple Macs around 2001 and was going to be based on the events that took place in the manga. The project was put on hold when creator Tony Luke was diagnosed with asbestosis, after making a recovery, the UK Sci-Fi Channel, whom Tony Luke had previously made a launch special for, approached him and asked for Dominator to be turned into a movie. With little time granted, much of the work what was created two years ago had to be salvaged with little revision while voice actors were collected. The film has been released to a largely negative reception due to how it was accidentally labeled anime thanks to the Sci-Fi Channel and because of the UK distributors, Salvation Films.\\\\- Series overview However, it has received positive comments from some and the determination of director Tony Luke, who was reportedly struggling with depression after his bout with cancer and an unforgiving work schedule, has been praised.

Some of his contributions to EC Comics appeared under the pseudonym Jerry Dee. Career Guests and visitors to Mad usually wound up chatting in DeFuccio's office. As noted by Mark Evanier: At EC Comics during the early 1950s, DeFuccio was an assistant editor and researcher on Harvey Kurtzman's war comics, Frontline Combat and Two-Fisted Tales, research that on one day involved taking a trip underwater in a submarine. He wrote scripts for EC and also contributed one- page text pieces to several EC titles. For Two-Fisted Tales #33 he wrote \\"Outpost\\" (illustrated by John Severin and Will Elder. For Frontline Combat he wrote \\"War Dance!\\" and \\"Belts n' Celts\\" (both illustrated by Severin) and \\"Wolf!\\" (illustrated by Wally Wood). He later wrote scripts for the line of war comics published by DC Comics, including Star Spangled War and Our Fighting Forces. DeFuccio teamed with artist Mart Bailey to create a superhero newspaper comic strip, \\"The Owl\\" (not to be confused with the comic book character The Owl from 1940). DeFuccio's book introductions include Bud Blake's Tiger (Grosset & Dunlap, 1969). As an expert on comic book history, he contributed to such publications as Squa Tront, Graphic Story Magazine, The Comics Journal, Wonderworld and The Comic Book Price Guide.

Biography  Vilhems Purvƒ´tis was born in Livonian Governorate, Zaube parish in a family of a miller. He studied in a local parish school until his family moved to Vitebsk Governorate. Until 1888 Purvƒ´tis studied in a municipal school in Drissa (Today: Belarus). It was here where his drawing skills were noticed for the first time. When his family returned to Vidzeme Purvƒ´tis worked in his fathers mill in Smiltene parish for a two years. Memorial stone in Smiltene parish In 1890 Purvƒ´tis started studies at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, Russia from 1890 to 1897, primarily under Arkhip Kuindzhi, graduating with the Grand Gold Medal. While in academy he studied paintings of old Dutch masters and became close friend with two other Latvian painters- Janis RozentƒÅls and Johan Valter. In 1898, Purvƒ´tis, RozentƒÅls, and Valter took a study trip across Europe and his paintings were exhibited in Berlin, Munich, Paris, and Lyon to great acclaim. In 1899 he returned to Riga and started to give private lessons in painting. In 1902 he traveled to Spitzbergen in Norway to study the painting of snow. After the Revolution of 1905 Purvƒ´tis traveled to Tallinn where he worked as a drawing teacher in a local Realschule. In 1909 Purvƒ´tis returned to Riga and became director of a Riga city art school. After the First World War started in 1915, Riga city art school was evacuated to St. Petersburg where it was closed in 1916. After the Russian revolutions of 1917 Purvƒ´tis went to Norway to improve his health and held his first solo exhibition in Oslo. Master Class in Landscape Painting at the Latvian Art Academy, 1942. Seated in the middle is Professor Vilhelms Purvƒ´tis In 1918 Purvƒ´tis returned to German occupied Riga. In 1919 he became director of a Riga city art museum (Today: Latvian National Museum of Art) and also was one of the founders of the Art Academy of Latvia and was elected as its first rector. As the leader of the landscape painting workshop at the Latvian Academy of Art from 1921 to 1944, of visual arts in the architecture department at the University of Latvia from 1919 to 1940, and director of the Riga City Art School from 1909 to 1915, Purvƒ´tis had a host of followers and was the acknowledged leader of a whole school of Latvian painting. During the period of the Republic of Latvia Purvƒ´tis also organized many exhibitions of Latvian art in Europe. After Latvian occupation by the Soviet Union in 1940 Purvƒ´tis was dismissed from the post of museum director but continued to work in the Art Academy. In 1942 his last exhibition in Riga was held. In 1944 Purvƒ´tis lost all of his belongings and many of his works when his house and workshop was destroyed during the Battle of Jelgava in the summer of 1944. Purvƒ´tis was forced to evacuate to LiepƒÅja and from there to Danzig. Wilhelms Purvƒ´tis died on January 14, 1945 in Bad Nauheim, Hessen. Purvƒ´tis' remains were reinterred at the Riga Forest Cemetery in 1994, after Latvia regained its independence. He was awarded with the Order of three stars (III and II class) and many more decorations. Constantly experimenting and becoming a master of snow scenes, Purvƒ´tis began as a Realist painter, turned to Impressionism, and was later influenced by C√©zanne and Munch. His painting Winter (1910) also suggests the influence of Art Nouveau. He is considered one of a greatest Latvian painters during first half of 20th century. His landscapes are full of local motives and Latvian nature is portrayed in the neo-romantic atmosphere. During his lifetime he produced more than thousand paintings and drawings and many of them were never exhibited because he preferred to collect them in his apartment.

Like It Is, Was, and Evermore Shall Be marked the second Hickory Records compilation of Donovan's 1965 Pye Records material in the United States, following the moderately successful The Real Donovan from 1966. History By 1968, Donovan had released a string of hit singles and albums in both the United States and United Kingdom. With his popularity reaching its zenith, Hickory Records compiled and released Like It Is, Was, and Evermore Shall Be from his 1965 Pye Records catalog. Although Donovan's Pye recordings bore little resemblance to his subsequent material, Hickory released the album with brightly colorful artwork reminiscent of Donovan's latest albums for Epic Records. The back cover contained a pair of reprinted fan letters; one a testimonial from a young female fan, the other thanks from a middle-aged businessman for the way one of Donovan's songs had caused him to reconsider life. (The song unfortunately was not named.) While most of the songs on Like It Is, Was, and Evermore Shall Be had been released on What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid (US-title: Catch the Wind), Fairytale, and The Real Donovan, the new compilation did contain \\"Why Do You Treat Me Like You Do\\" and Donovan's recording of Bert Jansch's \\"Do You Hear Me Now?\\", neither of which had been included on any of Donovan's US long players.

Each member of X-Cops performed in a police uniform and had their own character. They released the album You Have The Right To Remain Silent... on Metal Blade Records in 1995. The album included a cover of Deep Purple's \\"Highway Star\\" (with different lyrics, to reflect the theme of the album). In addition, they released a 7\\" single of the songs \\"Junkie\\" (featuring the first released vocal performance of Gwar/X-Cops guitarist Michael Derks) and \\"Beat You Down\\" on Man's Ruin Records in 1996. Peter Lee started this band after being shot in a failed car jacking attempt. The idea sparked while filming a commercial segment for Gwar's Skulhedface. Lee and Dave Brockie were dressed as police officers and Lee pondered, \\"What would be cooler than a bunch of cops playing kick-ass rock and roll?\\" This led to Lee, Brockie and Gwar's drum technician, Mike Dunn, starting X-Cops as a three-piece band. By the time they played their first show, their ranks had grown considerably. X-Cops opened for Gwar on some dates of their 1994 tour, essentially opening for themselves as every musician in Gwar either played an instrument or sang in X-Cops. They also did a headlining tour in 1995, and some select dates in 1996. There are two additional songs that X-Cops performed live, but never officially recorded: \\"Nurture My Pig\\" (originally a song by The Loco Gringo's ), and \\"Conflict Management\\" (sung by Zipper Pig). According to bootleg videos, Casey Orr (Tubb Tucker) played bass for \\"Conflict Management\\", taking the bass from Dave Brockie (Cobb Knobbler), who sang back- up. X-Cops played their final show in 1996 and Orr, Dunn, Lee, and Musel have since left both X-Cops and Gwar. Dave Brockie Experience has since been known to cover X-Cops songs during live shows. X-Cops reunited for one show only at the 4th annual Gwar-B-Q in Richmond, VA, on August 17, 2013. Band members=Main * Michael Derks as Lt.

He ruled in north, central, and eastern India around 110 BCE. Although the capital of the Shungas was at Pataliputra, he was also known to have held court at Vidisha. It is thought that the name Bhagabhadra also appears in the regnal lists of the Shungas in the Puranic records, under the name Bhadraka, fifth ruler of the Shungas. Heliodorus inscription He is best known from an inscription at the site of Vidisha in central India, the Heliodorus pillar, in which contacts with an embassy from the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas is recorded, and where he is named \\"Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, the Saviour, son of the princess from Benares\\": The Indo-Greek king Antialcidas was the one who sent an embassy to Bhagabhadra. Translation: :(Archaeological Survey of India, Annual Report (1908-1909)) Some of the expansion work at the Great Stupa at Sanchi may have been sponsored by Bhagabhadra. This inscription is important in that it tends to validate that the Shungas ruled in the area of Vidisa around 100 BCE. This is also corroborated by some artistic realization on the nearby Sanchi stupa thought to belong to the period of the Shungas. Altogether, three Shunga pillars have also been found in the area.
