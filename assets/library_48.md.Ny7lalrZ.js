Weill was commissioned in the spring to write one of a series of very short operas for performance that summer, and he chose to use the opportunity to create a \\"stylistic exercise\\" as preparation for a larger-scale project that they had begun to develop together (the two had met for the first time in March), their experimental 'epic opera' The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (1930).Willett and Manheim (1994, xvi-xvii, 358). The Little Mahagonny was based on five 'Mahagonny Songs', which had been published earlier in the year in Brecht's collection of poetry, Devotions for the Home (Hauspostille), together with tunes by Brecht. To these five was added a new poem, \\"Poem on a Dead Man\\", that was to form the finale. Two of the songs were English-language parodies written by Elisabeth Hauptmann: the \\"Alabama Song\\" and \\"Benares Song\\". Using one or two of Brecht's melodies as a starting-point, Weill began in May to set the songs to music and to compose orchestral interludes along the following pattern: :Song One  Little March  Alabama Song  Vivace  Song Two  Vivace assai  Benares Song  Sostenuto (Choral)  Song Three  Vivace assai  Finale: Poem on a Dead ManWillett and Manheim (1994, 358). The Little Mahagonny was first produced at the new German chamber music festival at Baden-Baden on 17 July 1927. Brecht directed, Lotte Lenya played Jessie, and the set-design was by Caspar Neher, who placed the scene in a boxing-ring before background projections that interjected scene-titles at the start of each section.Sacks (1994, xix) and Willett and Manheim (1994, xvi, 358-9). According to a sketch published years later, they read: # The great cities in our day are full of people who do not like it there. # So get away to Mahagonny, the gold town situated on the shores of consolation far from the rush of the world. # Here in Mahagonny life is lovely. # But even in Mahagonny there are moments of nausea, helplessness and despair. # The men of Mahagonny are heard replying to God's inquiries as to the cause of their sinful life. # Lovely Mahagonny crumbles to nothing before your eyes.Quoted by Willett and Manheim (1994, 359) A programme note for the performance stated: > Mahagonny is a short epic play which simply draws conclusions from the > irresistible decline of our existing social classes. It is already turning > towards a public which goes to the theatre naïvely and for fun.\\"Quoted by > Willett (1967, 29). The production lasted about forty-five minutes and was a > great success, although there were no immediate plans for a revival.Willett > (1967, 29). Stephen Sondheim was asked to translate this piece once with W. H. Auden, but declined. He said of this event, \\"But, I'm not a Brecht/Weill fan and that's really all there is to it. I'm an apostate: I like Weill's music when he came to America better than I do his stuff before...I love The Threepenny Opera but, outside of The Threepenny Opera, the music of his I like is the stuff he wrote in America—when he was not writing with Brecht, when he was writing for Broadway.\\"Pat Cerasaro, \\"InDepth InterView: Andrew Lloyd Webber Talks LOVE NEVER DIES, PHANTOM 25, Ricky Martin & More\\", 29 January 2012 on broadwayworld.com Retrieved 4 February 2012 Performance history After its first performance in 1927 with the Deutsches Kammermusikfest under the direction of Walter Brügmann and conducted by Ernst Mehlich, it was presented on 11 December 1932 in Paris at the Salle Gaveau.

Years later, The Little Mahagonny was produced, in a much adapted version, by the Berliner Ensemble at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in East Berlin. It opened on 10 February 1963 and was directed by Matthias Langhoff and Manfred Karge.

The original structure was the first mosque ever built in Egypt and the whole of Africa. For 600 years, the mosque was also an important center of Islamic learning until Al-Muizz's Al- Azhar Mosque in Islamic Cairo replaced it. Through the twentieth century, it was the fourth largest mosque in the Islamic world. The location for the mosque was the site of the tent of the commander of the Muslim army, general Amr ibn al-As. One corner of the mosque contains the tomb of his son, 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As. Due to extensive reconstruction over the centuries nothing of the original building remains, but the rebuilt Mosque is a prominent landmark and can be seen in what today is known as Old Cairo. It is an active mosque with a devout congregation, and when prayers are not taking place, it is also open to visitors and tourists.Eyewitness, p. 124 Mosque of Amr ibn al-As Location According to tradition, the original location was chosen by a bird. Amr ibn al-As, by order of Caliph Umar, was the Arab general that conquered Egypt from the Romans. In 641, before he and his army attacked their capital city of Alexandria (at the northwestern part of the Nile river delta), Amr had set up his tent on the eastern side of the Nile, at the southern part of the delta. As the story is told, shortly before Amr set off to battle, a dove laid an egg in his tent. When Amr returned victorious, he needed to choose a site for a new capital city, since Umar had decreed that it could not be in far-away Alexandria. So Amr declared the site of the dove's egg sacred, and made it the center of his new city, Fustat, or Misr al-Fustat, \\"City of the Tents\\". Later, the Mosque of Amr was built on the same location. Mosque of Amr in Cairo. 1893. Wilbour Library of Egyptology, Brooklyn Museum Structure Interior view of the mosque Egypt - Mosque of Amru, Cairo. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection Arcades in the Mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As The original layout was a simple rectangle, 29 meters in length by 17 meters wide. It was a low shed with columns made from split palm tree trunks, stones and mud bricks, covered by a roof of wood and palm leaves. The floor was of gravel. Inside the building the orientation toward Mecca was not noted by a concave niche like it would be in all later mosques. Instead four columns were used to point out the direction of mecca, and were inserted on the qibla wall. It was large enough to provide prayer space for Amr's army, but had no other adornments, and no minarets. It was completely rebuilt in 673 by the governor Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Ansari, who added four minarets, one at each of the mosque's corners, and doubled its area in size. The addition of these minarets allowed the call to prayer to be heard from every corner, and taken up by other nearby mosques. Governor Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan added an extension to the mosque in 698 and once again doubled the mosque's area. In 711 a concave prayer niche was added to replace the flat one. In 827, it had seven new aisles built, parallel to the wall of the qibla, the direction that Muslims were to face during prayer. Each aisle had an arcade of columns, with the last column in each row attached to the wall by means of a wooden architrave carved with a frieze. In 827, governor Abd Allah ibn Tahir made more additions to the mosque. It was enlarged to its present size, and the southern wall of the present day mosque was built. In the 9th century, the mosque was extended by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mamun, who added a new area on the southwest side, increasing the mosque's dimensions to 120m x 112m. At a point during the Fatimid era, the mosque had five minarets. There were four, with one at each corner, and one at the entrance. However, all five are now gone. The current Minarets were built by Mourad Bey in 1800. Also, the Fatimid Caliph al-Mustansir added a silver belt to the prayer niche which was eventually removed by Saladin when the mosque was restored after the fire in Fustat. In 1169, the city of Fustat and the mosque were destroyed by a fire that was ordered by Egypt's own vizier Shawar, who had ordered its destruction to prevent the city from being captured by the Crusaders. After the Crusaders were expelled, and the area had been conquered by Nur al-Din's army, Saladin took power, and had the mosque rebuilt in 1179. During this time Saladin had a belvedere built below a minaret. In the 14th, century Burhan al-Din Ibrahim al-Mahalli paid the costs of restoring the mosque. In 1303, Amir Salar restored the mosque after an earthquake. He also added a stucco prayer niche for the outer wall of the mosque, which is now gone. In the 18th century one of the Egyptian Mamluk leaders, Mourad Bey, destroyed the mosque because of dilapidation then ordered the rebuilding of it in 1796, before the arrival of Napoleon's French Expedition to Egypt. During Mourad's reconstruction, the builders decreased the number of rows of columns from seven to six, and changed the orientation of the aisles to make them perpendicular to the qibla wall. It was also probably at this time that the current remaining minarets were added. Unfortunately, during the French occupation much of the interior wood decoration was taken for firewood by the French Army. In 1875, the mosque was again rebuilt. In the 20th century, during the reign of Egypt's Abbas Helmi II, the mosque underwent another restoration. Parts of the entrance were reconstructed in the 1980s. The only part of the mosque's older structure which can still be seen are some of the architraves, which can be viewed along the southern wall of the Mosque. These were probably added during reconstruction in 827. Notes and referencesSee also * Lists of mosques * List of mosques in Africa * List of mosques in Egypt Sources * Behrens-Abouseif. Doris. 1989.

In August 2020, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the short-term treatment of suicidal thoughts.  Medical uses = Anesthesia  Esketamine is a general anesthetic and is used for similar indications as ketamine. Such uses include induction of anesthesia in high-risk patients such as those with hemorrhagic shock, anaphylactic shock, septic shock, severe bronchospasm, severe hepatic insufficiency, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis; anesthesia in caesarian section; use of multiple anesthetics in burns; and as a supplement to regional anesthesia with incomplete nerve blocks.  Depression  Similarly to ketamine, esketamine appears to be a rapid-acting antidepressant. It received a breakthrough designation from the for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in 2013 and major depressive disorder (MDD) with accompanying suicidal ideation in 2016. The medication was studied for use in combination with an antidepressant in people with TRD who had been unresponsive to treatment; six phase III clinical trials for this indication were conducted in 2017. It is available as a nasal spray. In February 2019, an outside panel of experts recommended that the FDA approve the nasal spray version of esketamine, provided that it be given in a clinical setting, with people remaining on site for at least two hours after. The reasoning for this requirement is that trial participants temporarily experienced sedation, visual disturbances, trouble speaking, confusion, numbness, and feelings of dizziness during immediately after. In January 2020, esketamine was rejected by the National Health Service of Great Britain. NHS questioned the benefits and claimed that it was too expensive. People who have been already using the medication were allowed to complete treatment if their doctors consider this necessary. Side effects Most common side effects when used in those with treatment resistant depression include dissociation, dizziness, nausea, sleepiness, anxiety, and increased blood pressure.  Pharmacology  Esketamine is approximately twice as potent as an anesthetic as racemic ketamine. It is eliminated from the human body more quickly than arketamine (R(–)-ketamine) or racemic ketamine, although arketamine slows its elimination. A number of studies have suggested that esketamine has a more medically useful pharmacological action than arketamine or racemic ketamine but, in mice, that the rapid antidepressant effect of arketamine was greater and lasted longer than that of esketamine.. The usefulness of arketamine over eskatamine has been supported by other researchers. Esketamine inhibits dopamine transporters eight times more than arketamine. This increases dopamine activity in the brain. At doses causing the same intensity of effects, esketamine is generally considered to be more pleasant by patients. Patients also generally recover mental function more quickly after being treated with pure esketamine, which may be a result of the fact that it is cleared from their system more quickly. This is however in contradiction with R-ketamine being devoid of psychotomimetic side effects. Unlike arketamine, esketamine does not bind significantly to sigma receptors. Esketamine increases glucose metabolism in frontal cortex, while arketamine decreases glucose metabolism in the brain. This difference may be responsible for the fact that esketamine generally has a more dissociative or hallucinogenic effect while arketamine is reportedly more relaxing. However, another study found no difference between racemic and (S)-ketamine on the patient's level of vigilance. Interpretation of this finding is complicated by the fact that racemic ketamine is 50% (S)-ketamine.  History  Esketamine was introduced for medical use as an anesthetic in Germany in 1997, and was subsequently marketed in other countries. In addition to its anesthetic effects, the medication showed properties of being a rapid-acting antidepressant, and was subsequently investigated for use as such. In November 2017, it completed phase III clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression in the United States. Johnson & Johnson filed a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) New Drug Application (NDA) for approval on September 4, 2018; the application was endorsed by an FDA advisory panel on February 12, 2019, and on March 5, 2019, the FDA approved esketamine, in conjunction with an oral antidepressant, for the treatment of depression in adults.  Society and culture =Names  Esketamine is the generic name of the drug and its and , while esketamine hydrochloride is its . It is also known as S(+)-ketamine, (S)-ketamine, or (–)-ketamine, as well as by its developmental code name JNJ-54135419. Esketamine is marketed under the brand name Spravato for use as an antidepressant and the brand names Ketanest, Ketanest S, Ketanest-S, Keta-S for use as an anesthetic (veterinary), among others.  Availability  Esketamine is marketed as an antidepressant in the United States; and as an anesthetic in the European Union.  Legal status  Esketamine is a Schedule III controlled substance in the United States. In the 1980s and '90s, closely associated ketamine was used as a club drug known as \\"Special K\\" for its trip-inducing side effects.

Though it is more expensive than other induction agents, it often preferred due to the lack of depressive effects on the cardiovascular system. The most common side effect seen in current veterinary practice is respiratory depression when Alfaxan is administered concurrently with other sedative and anesthetic drugs; when premedications aren't given, veterinary patients also become agitated and hypersensitive when waking up. Alfaxalone works as a positive allosteric modulator on GABAA receptors and, at high concentrations, as a direct agonist of the GABAA receptor. It is cleared quickly by the liver, giving it a relatively short terminal half-life and preventing it from accumulating in the body, lowering the chance of overdose. Veterinary use Alfaxalone is used as an induction agent, an injectable anesthetic, and a sedative in animals. While it is commonly used in cats and dogs, it has also been successfully used in rabbits, horses, sheep, pigs, and exotics such as red-eared turtles, axolotl, green iguanas, marmosets, and koi fish. As an induction agent, alfaxalone causes the animal to relax enough to be intubated, which then allows the administration of inhalational anesthesia. Premedication (administering sedative drugs prior to induction) increases the potency of alfaxalone as an induction agent. Alfaxalone can be used instead of gas anesthetics in surgeries that are under 30 minutes, where it is given at a constant rate via IV (constant rate infusion); this is especially useful in procedures such as bronchoscopies or repairing tracheal tears, as there is no endotracheal tube in the way. Once the administration of alfaxalone stops, the animal quickly recovers from anesthesia. Alfaxalone can be used as a sedative when given intramuscularly (IM), though this requires a larger volume (and not all countries allow alfaxalone to be administered IM). Despite its use as an anesthetic, alfaxalone itself has no analgesic properties. Available forms Though alfaxalone is not licensed for IM or subcutaneous use in the United States (as both cause longer recoveries with greater agitation and hypersensitivity to stimuli), it is routinely used IM in cats, and is licensed as such in other countries. Alfaxalone is dissolved in 2-hydroxylpropyl-β cyclodextrin (which is toxic to people). The cyclodextrin is a large, starch- derived molecule with a hydrophobic core where alfaxalone stays, allowing the mixture to be dissolved in water and sold as an aqueous solution. They act as one unit, and only dissociate once in vivo. Specific populations Alfaxalone has been used to perform c-sections in pregnant cats; though it crosses the placental barrier and had some effects on the kittens, there is no respiratory depression and no lasting effect. Alfaxalone has also been found to be safe in young puppies and kittens. Alfaxalone has been noted to be a good anesthetic agent for dogs with ventricular arrhythmias and for sighthounds. Side effects Alfaxalone has relatively few side effects compared to other anesthetics; most notable is its lack of cardiovascular depression at clinical doses, which makes it unique among anesthetics. The most common side effect is respiratory depression: in addition to apnea, the most prevalent, alfaxalone can also decrease the respiratory rate, minute volume, and oxygen saturation in the blood. Alfaxalone should be administered slowly over a period of at least 60 seconds or until anesthesia is induced, as quick administration increases the risk of apnea. Alfaxalone has some depressive effects on the central nervous system, including a reduction in cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, and body temperature. Greyhounds, who are particularly susceptible to anesthetic side effects, can have decreased blood flow and oxygen supply to the liver. When no premedications are used, alfaxalone causes animals (especially cats) to be agitated when recovering. Dogs and cats will paddle in the air, vocalize excessively, may remain rigid or twitch, and have exaggerated reactions to external stimuli such as light and noise. For this reason, it is recommended that animals recovering from anesthesia by alfaxalone stay in a quiet, dark area. Overdose The quick metabolism and elimination of alfaxalone from the body decreases the chance of overdose. It would take over 28 times the normal dose to cause toxicity in cats. Such doses, however, can cause low blood pressure, apnea, hypoxia, and arrhythmia (caused by the apnea and hypoxia). Pharmacology=Pharmacodynamics GABAA receptor and the location of various ligand-binding sites. Alfaxalone is a neuroactive steroid derived from progesterone, though it has no glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid action. Instead, it works by acting on GABAA receptors. It binds to the M3/M4 domains of the α subunit and allosterically modifies the receptor to facilitate the movement of chloride ions into the cell, resulting in hyperpolarization of the post-synaptic nerve (which inhibits actions potentials). At concentrations over 1 micromolar, alfaxalone binds to a site at the interface between the α and β subunits (near the actual GABA binding site) and acts as a GABA agonist, similar to benzodiazepines. Alfaxalone, however, does not share the benzodiazepine binding site, and actually prefers different GABAA receptors than benzodiazepenes do. It works best on the α1-β2-γ2-L isoform. Research suggests that neuroactive steroids increase the expression of GABAA receptors, making it more difficult to build tolerance. Pharmacokinetics Alfaxalone is metabolized quickly and does not accumulate in the body; its use as an induction agent thus doesn't increase the time needed to recover from anesthesia. If it administered more slowly by diluting it in sterile water, less actual alfaxalone is needed. Alfaxalone binds to 30–50% of plasma proteins, and has a terminal half-life of 25 minutes in dogs and 45 minutes in cats when given at clinical doses (2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg respectively). The pharmacokinetics are nonlinear in cats and dogs. Most alfaxalone metabolism takes place in the liver, though some takes place in the lungs and kidneys as well. In the liver, it undergoes both phase I (cytochrome P450-dependent) and phase II (conjugation-dependent) metabolism. The phase I products are the same in cats and dogs: allopregnatrione, 3β-alfaxalone, 20-hydroxy-3β-alfaxalone, 2-hydroxyalfaxalone, and 2α-hydroxyalfaxalone. In dogs, the phase II metabolites are alfaxalone glucuronide (the major metabolite), 20-hydroxyalfaxalone sulfate, and 2α-hydroxyalfaxalone glucuronid. In cats, there is a greater production of 20-hydroxyalfaxalone sulfate than alfaxalone glucuronide; cats also have 3β-alfaxalone-sulfate, which is not present in dogs. Alfaxalone is mostly excreted in the urine, though some is excreted in the bile as well. Chemistry Progesterone (left) and its derivative, alfaxolan (right); the differences are highlighted in pink. Alfaxalone, also known as 11-oxo-3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone, 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione, or 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a modification of progesterone in which the C3 ketone has been reduced to a hydroxyl group, the double bond between the C4 and C5 positions has been reduced and is now a single bond, and a ketone has been substituted at the C11 position. Alfaxalone is also a derivative of allopregnanolone, differing from it only by the addition of the C11 ketone. Other closely related steroids include ganaxolone, hydroxydione, minaxolone, pregnanolone, and renanolone. History In 1941, progesterone and 5β-pregnanedione were discovered to have CNS depressant effects in rodents. This began a search to make a synthetic steroid that could be used as an anesthetic. Most of these efforts were aimed at making alfaxalone more water-soluble. In 1971, a combination of alfaxalone and alfadolone acetate was released as the anesthetics Althesin (for human use) and Saffan (for veterinary use). The two were dissolved in Cremophor EL: a polyoxyelthylated castor oil surfactant. Althesin was removed from the market in 1984 for causing anaphylaxis; it was later found that this was due to Cremphor EL, which caused the body to release histamine, rather than alfaxolone or alfadolone. Saffan was removed from use for dogs only, but stayed on for other animals, none of which histamine release to the same extant that dogs did. It was still especially valued in cats for its lack of depressant effects on the cardiovascular system, which made it three times less fatal than any other anesthetic on the market at the time. The release of histamine caused most cats (70%) to have edema and hyperemia in their ears and paws; only some also got laryngeal or pulmonary edema. In 1999, a lyophilized form of alfaxalone was released for cats. The new drug, Alfaxan, used a cyclodextrin as a carrier agent to make alfaxalone more water-soluble rather than Camphor EL. Alfadolone was not included in the mixture, as its hypnotic effects were quite weak. An aqueous form of Alfaxan was released in Australia in 2000–2001, and Saffan was finally removed from the market in 2002. Alfaxan was released in the UK in 2007, central Europe in 2008, Canada in 2011, and the United States in 2012. Currently, a human form of alfaxalone is in development under the name \\"Phaxan\\": alfaxalone will be dissolved in 7-sulfo-butyl-ether-β-cyclodextrin, which, unlike the cyclodextrin used in Alfaxan, is not toxic to people. Society and culture=Generic names Alfaxalone is the , , , and of alfaxolone. Alphaxalone was the former of the drug, but this was eventually changed. Alphaxolone and alfaxolone are additional alternative spellings. Brand names Alfaxalone was marketed in 1971 in combination with alfadolone acetate under the brand name Althesin for human use and Saffan for veterinary use. Althesin was withdrawn from the market in 1984, whereas Saffan remained marketed. A new formulation containing alfaxalone only was introduced for veterinary use in 1999 under the brand name Alfaxan. Following the introduction of Alfaxan, Saffan was gradually discontinued and is now no longer marketed. Another new formulation containing alfaxalone alone is currently under development for use in humans with the tentative brand name Phaxan. Availability Alfaxalone is marketed for veterinary use under the brand name Alfaxan in a number of countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

It is a colorless, volatile liquid that has mainly been of interest as an inhalation anesthetic. It is prepared by treating bis(chloroethyl) ether with base. History The analytical techniques used to study its pharmacology laid the groundwork for the testing of new anesthetic agents. Vinyl ether was first prepared in 1887 by Semmler from its sulfur substituted analogue, divinyl sulfide (obtained from the essential oil of Allium ursinum L.), by reaction with silver oxide. In 1899, Knorr and Matthes obtained low yields of vinyl ether by exhaustive methylation of morpholine.R. Major, et al. U.S. Patent 2,021,872, 1935 Cretcher et al. reported, in 1925, what would become the foundation for one industrial method used to produce vinyl ether. It was stated that the action of heated sodium hydroxide upon β,β\`-dichlorodiethyl ether produced a liquid boiling at 39 °C (among other identified products). However, in a subtly modified process Hibbert et al. reported the isolation of a product boiling at 34-35 °C, \\"divinyl ether\\". Finally, in 1929, a patent issued to Merck & Co reported isolation of vinyl ether boiling ca. 28 °C. The currently accepted boiling point of vinyl ether is 28.3 °C; the Merck patent, therefore, was the first to report the isolation of a pure product. Even before its isolation and characterization, the application of an unsaturated ether as an anesthetic interested some pharmacologists. One such pharmacologist, Chauncey Leake, was particularly captivated by the then theoretical vinyl ether. Leake predicted that vinyl ether would combine the properties of two anesthetic agents, ethyl ether, and ethylene.Mazurek, M J. California Society of Anesthesiologists Bulletin 2007, 55(4), 86-9. As an anesthetic ethylene has many favorable properties, although its very low potency often requires hypoxic conditions to achieve full anesthesia. Ethyl ether, on the other hand, is a relatively potent anesthetic but falls short of ethylene in some respects. In comparison to ether, ethylene has a much lower occurrence of post operative nausea; additionally, ethylene has faster induction and recovery times than ether.McIntosch. The American Journal of Nursing 1925, 25(4), 290-93 Solely guided by predictions based upon structure, Leake pursued the usage of vinyl ether as an inhalation anesthetic.The Science News-Letter, Vol. 26, No. 709. (Nov. 10, 1934), pp. 293–294 As vinyl ether was unknown in its pure form, Leake approached organic chemists at Berkeley asking them to synthesize this novel anesthetic. Leake's colleagues however, were unable to prepare vinyl ether; later though, Leake received help from two Princeton chemists, Randolph Major and W. T. Ruigh. Using samples received from Princeton, in 1930, Leake and fellow researcher Mei-Yu Chen published a brief study characterizing the anesthetic effects of vinyl ether upon mice. In the conclusion of this study, they cordially invited further research of this drug. This invitation was accepted; in 1933 Samuel Gelfan and Irving Bell of the University of Alberta published the first human trials of vinyl ether. They reported the experience of Gelfan himself as he was anesthetized with vinyl ether via the open drop technique. Although, according to Leake, anesthesiologist Mary Botsford at the University of California was the first to clinically administer vinyl ether for a hysterectomy in early 1932. Thenceforth, vinyl ether was studied extensively at other institutions, though political climate at Berkeley hindered further study by Leake. Vinyl ether had some success but its usage was limited by aforementioned concerns of liver toxicity and degradation upon long term storage. Properties Vinyl ether is a rather unstable compound which with exposure to light or acid decomposes to acetaldehyde and polymerizes into a glassy solid. Like many other ethers, vinyl ether is also liable to form peroxides upon exposure to air and light. For these reasons vinyl ether is sold with inhibitors such as polyphenols and amines to quell polymerization and peroxide formation.R. Major, et al. U.S. Patent 2,099,695, 1937 The anesthetic product was inhibited with .01% phenyl- α-napthylamine which gave it a faint violet fluorescence.Finer, Basil. Br. J. Anaesthesiol. 1965, 37, 661-66 Vinyl ether rapidly decolorizes a solution of bromine in carbon tetrachloride; it is also rapidly oxidized by aqueous potassium permanganate; sulfuric acid reacts with vinyl ether producing a black tarry resin and some acetaldehyde. Anesthetic In the United States, vinyl ether was sold under the trade name Vinethene. In addition to the normal inhibitors, vinyl ether intended for anesthetic use contained some ethanol (1.5-5%) to prevent frosting of the anesthetic mask. Despite inhibitors manufacturers warned that once opened vinyl ether should be used quickly. Stumpf, E H. The Journal of American Institute of Homeopathy 1935, 28(9) Vinyl ether has a rapid onset with little excitement upon induction. Induction causes little coughing however produces increased salivation. During anesthesia vinyl ether can cause some patients to twitch. In rare cases this twitching can lead to convulsions; these convulsions are treatable. Martin, Stevens. Anesthesiology 1941, 2(3), 285-299 Additionally, morphine-atropine pre-medication usually prevents this problem. The recovery from vinyl ether is rapid with only rare cases of post operative nausea and vomiting, although headache after anesthesia sometimes occurs. Short operations pose little danger to the patient. Longer operations which use greater than 200 mL of anesthetic can be dangerous due to hepatic and renal toxicity. In an attempt to circumvent the toxicity of vinyl ether while maintaining its favorable properties it was mixed 1:4 with ethyl ether producing ‘Vinethene Anesthetic Mixture’ (V.A.M.). V.A.M. shows smoother induction and recovery than ethyl ether alone yet is relatively non-toxic for longer procedures. Though compared to ethyl ether V.A.M is less suitable for cases requiring deep anesthesia. Vinyl ether is a potent anesthetic giving it a large safety margin; the ratio of the anesthetic to lethal does for vinyl ether is 1 to 2.4 (ethyl ether: 1:1.5). Anderson L. F. The American Journal of Nursing 1937, 37(2), 276-280 However, this potency is hard to control with simplistic equipment. While anesthetic machines were numerous during the years of vinyl ether's popularity, the simplistic ‘open drop technique’ also maintained its prevalence. Anesthetic machines of the time could suitably contain vinyl ether's potency, however, via the open drop technique smooth anesthesia for long procedures was hard to sustain. Further aggravating this problem, warm temperatures increase the volatility of vinyl ether making it even harder to regulate via the open drop technique. Overall, vinyl ether's only strengths compared to ethyl ether are favorable induction and recovery. During anesthesia vinyl ether has no particularly wonderful properties and is harder to control than other agents. Therefore, vinyl ether was commonly used as a preliminary anesthetic before administration of diethyl ether. Additionally, vinyl ether was only used for short operations or analgesia, e.g. dentistry and obstetrics. Vinyl ether was used infrequently for long operations because of toxicity, cost, and superior alternatives. Also, experiments were conducted with ethyl vinyl ether, a compound with one vinyl and one ethyl group. This substance produced results placing it between diethyl ether and divinyl ether both in terms of toxicity and speed of induction and recovery, producing promising results similar to V.A.M. Despite much simpler synthesis (vinylization of ethanol with acetylene) ethyl vinyl ether didn't enter widespread use in anesthetics, as superior halogenated ethers replaced it shortly after its first trials. Many divinyl ether derivatives of fatty acids exist in nature.

Part of the ISO/IEC 27000 series of ISO/IEC Information Security Management System (ISMS) standards, it is titled Information technology - Security techniques - Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security management systems. ISO/IEC 27006 lays out formal requirements for accredited organizations which certify other organizations compliant with ISO/IEC 27001. It effectively replaces EA 7/03 (Guidelines for the Accreditation of bodies operating certification/ registration of. Information Security Management Systems). The standard helps ensure that ISO/IEC 27001 certificates issued by accredited organizations are meaningful and trustworthy, in other words it is a matter of assurance.  Description of standard  ISO 27006 outlines requirements to be accredited for third parties who audit and certify information security management systems (ISMS), in addition to the requirements set by ISO 17021-1 and ISO 27001. This standard was first published in 2007, and it had to be revised twice due to significant changes made to ISO 17021 standard. The current version is ISO 27006 third edition published in 2015. ISO 27006:2015 sets standards for demonstration of ISMS auditors' competence. Certification Body auditing ISMS is required to verify each auditor on the auditing team has the knowledge of: * ISMS monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation, * Information security, * Management systems, * Auditing principles, and * Technical knowledge of systems to be audited. All auditors on the team must collectively be versed in information systems management terminology, principles, and techniques. They must know all requirements from ISO 27001, all controls listed in ISO 27002. Also, auditors must be aware of business management practices, the legal and regulatory requirements in a particular information systems field, geography, and jurisdictions. Competence must also be demonstrated by personnel reviewing the audits and making certification decisions. They need to have sufficient knowledge to verify the accuracy of the certification scope. Also, they need to have general knowledge of management systems, audit procedures, principles, and techniques. ISO27006:2015 also outlines adequate education, professional development, training covering ISMS audits, and current/relevant experience level.  Intent of standard  The primary intent of ISO 27006 is to support the accreditation for third parties certifying the information security management system. Any accredited third-party auditing and confirming compliance with ISO 27001 must follow the requirements in this standard to ensure the ISMS certifications are valid. Accredited third parties need to demonstrate their competence and reliability.  Application  A mid-size organization seeking ISO 27001 certification need to hire an accredited certification body to complete ISMS certification audit. The organization should complete due diligence to ensure the selected auditing firm complies with ISO27006:2015 standard. During the audit, the organization should ensure all documentation necessary to complete the audit is available, provide the auditing team ISMS records, including but limited to information about ISMS design and effectiveness of the controls.

Wolfe Publishing Co.:Prescott, Arizona. pg. 235 The cartridge is standardized by the C.I.P. and is also known as .404 Rimless Nitro Express.https://bobp.cip- bobp.org/uploads/tdcc/tab-i/tabical-en-page145.pdf It was designed in 1905 by London based gunmaker W.J. Jeffery & Co to duplicate the performance of the .450/400 Nitro Express 3-inch in bolt-action rifles. The .404 Jeffery fired a bullet of .422 in (10.72 mm) diameter of either with a muzzle velocity of and muzzle energy of or with a muzzle velocity of and of energy. It is very effective on large game and is favored by many hunters of dangerous game. The .404 Jeffery was popular with hunters and game wardens in Africa because of good performance with a manageable recoil. By way of comparison, the .416 Rigby and .416 Remington Magnum cartridges fire a .416 in (10.57 mm) bullet of 400 gr (26 g) at with a muzzle energy of approximately . These cartridges exceed the ballistic performance of the .404 Jeffery but at the price of greater recoil and in the case of the .416 Rigby, rifles that are more expensive. History Originally the .404 Jeffery was very popular with hunters in Africa and saw significant use in both British and German colonies. As the British Empire began to shrink, many of the popular British big-bore cartridges also dwindled in popularity, and the .404 Jeffery was one of them. By the 1960s it had all but disappeared from common firearm usage. This condition was mostly the result of the closing of the British ammunition giant Kynoch, which was the primary manufacturer of the .404 Jeffery and many other British cartridges. The introduction of the .458 Winchester Magnum in 1956 in the Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle provided an affordable alternative to the big Nitro Express rifles and cartridges. Winchester also started a marketing campaign at about this time called \\"Winchester in Africa\\" with much success. Renewed interest in heavy game rifles and political stability in Africa has led to a resurgence in African hunting and the rifles suited for it. Several ammunition makers like Kynoch, Norma, Federal, and Hornady are offering .404 Jeffery sporting ammunition. A more recent development by Norma of Sweden has been the introduction of 450 gr ammunition under their African PH banner. The increase in bullet weight and sectional density turns the ballistics of the .404 Jeffery into something to behold. Fired at 2150 fps the cartridge now outperforms most of its peers with a still relatively mild recoil due to the efficient design of the cartridge. The ability to do this out of a standard length Mauser action makes it one of the top contenders as the greatest large-medium bore cartridge in existence today. Heavy for caliber bullets are available from Woodleigh Bullets, Australia. Commercial and wildcat variations In 1908, W.J. Jeffery & Co created the .333 Jeffery by shortening the .404 case, giving it greater taper and necking it down to .333 in (8.5 mm).Roberts, Paul, Nitro big game rifles, retrieved 24 Jan 16. In 1913, Jeffery further necked down the .333 Jeffery to .288 inches, creating the .280 Jeffery. In recent times, the .404 case has seen a resurgence in use by wildcatters. This case has no belt, unlike many other magnum cartridges, which can be desirable for handloading because of possible problems with case head separation with repeated reloading of belted magnum cartridges. The rimless design also contributes to smooth feeding from the box magazine of bolt-action rifles. Some common commercial children of the .404 Jeffery case are the Remington Ultra Magnum (RUM) cartridge family, which in turn spawned the Remington Short Action Ultra Magnum (RSAUM) cartridges. Also, the Winchester Short Magnum (WSM) and the Winchester Super Short Magnum (WSSM) families are believed to derive from the 404 Jeffery case. Both the Winchester and Remington cartridges have also spawned many current wildcats, like the popular .338 Edge. All but one (.450 Dakota, based on .416 Rigby) of the proprietary cartridges of Dakota Arms such as .375 Dakota, and the .400 Tembo by Velocity USA, and the once-famous .460 G&A;, used by Jeff Cooper in his \\"Baby\\" rifles,Cooper, Jeff (1998). To Ride, Shoot Straight, and Speak the Truth. Paladin Press. are all based on .404 Jeffery. Another example of the popularity of creating small-bore, high velocity cartridges based on .404 Jeffery design is the .26 Nosler, .28 Nosler, .30 Nosler and the latest .33 Nosler, introduced by Nosler in between 2013 and 2016.

It serves a rapidly growing population of more than 400,000 people in the Casey Cardinia Region. Libraries are located at Cranbourne, Doveton, Emerald, Endeavour Hills, Hampton Park, Narre Warren and Pakenham, with the Cardinia Mobile Library providing weekly service to Beaconsfield, Bunyip, Cockatoo, Garfield, Gembrook, Koo Wee Rup, Lang Lang, Maryknoll, Nar Nar Goon, Tynong and Upper Beaconsfield. Casey Cardinia Libraries is a library corporation constituted under the Local Government Act 1989 and funded by the City of Casey, Cardinia Shire Council and the Victorian State Government History Casey Cardinia Library Corporation (CCL) was formed on 1 October 1996. It was previously part of the Dandenong Valley Regional Library Service (DVRLS) which was disbanded following Council amalgamations in 1995. The City of Greater Dandenong took over operations of the Dandenong and Springvale branches and CCL continued to operate the remaining branches from its new headquarters in Cranbourne. Branches=Cranbourne Library Cranbourne Shire Library began providing library services from the former Engineer's offices in Sladen street in 1978. The formation of CCL in 1996 led to the establishment of 'Headquarters' and the relocation of Cranbourne branch to part of the former Ford Factory in Berwick Cranbourne Road. The library was renovated and extended in 2002. Doveton Library After a couple of earlier incarnations, the Shire of Berwick rented the Presbyterian Church Hall as library premises in 1969. It moved to 148 Kidd Road where it became the 2nd branch (after Springvale) of the DVRLS in 1973. The council then purchased a Service station in Autumn Place next to the shopping centre and, after extensive renovations, opened the current Doveton library there in 1983. The library was renovated and extended in 2008. Emerald Library The $2.2 million Emerald Library opened in July 2006. Endeavour Hills Library Rapid population growth in Endeavour Hills in the early 1980s resulted in the construction of a permanent library to replace the mobile service. The building was officially opened in Raymond McMahon Boulevard on 31 May 1987. A 2007 renovation and extension has significantly increased the size of the library. Pakenham Library Hampton Park Library Hampton Park Library opened in January 2004. Since then patronage has increased by between 120-150 new members each month, resulting in approx 11,000 members in late 2008. An application to extend the Library through a Living Libraries Grant was successful. The official opening of the Hampton Park library extension (of 270 m2) and new Youth Centre took place on 30/10/10. Narre Warren Library Narre Warren library in Malcolm Court, Narre Warren began operations in 1978. In 1992, it moved into premises at Fountain Gate Shopping Centre adjacent to the City of Berwick offices. At 1350 square metres, it is the largest of the CCL libraries. Pakenham Library Pakenham Library began providing library services in Pakenham from portable buildings in 1979. The building was located at the corner of John Street and Drake street (on the site now occupied by the Fruit and Vegetable market). The first permanent building (also in John street, opposite the Fire Station) opened in 1991 and closed in 2009. A new $mil 7.5 complex housing a library, hall and U3A was officially opened at the corner of John and Henry streets on Friday 15 July 2011. Cardinia Mobile Library A Bookmobile service was introduced to the Pakenham area in 1973. The current vehicle has been in service since 1999. It underwent a refurbishment in April 2010 that included painting, recarpeting, a new desk and air conditioning/heating units as well as relocation of the disability hoist to the rear of the vehicle. The vehicle carries over 13000 items and makes weekly visits to eleven towns in Cardinia.

He was archbishop at an important time in the history of Narbonne and Languedoc in general; a time when the Roman Catholic Church denounced the local religious way of life as heretical. In 1165, Pons called a council (or colloquy) at Lombers, near Albi, to deal with the spreading Catharism in his archdiocese, largely in response to the council held at Tours in 1163 under Pope Alexander III.Lea, 118. The council was a public debate between Cathars (who called themselves bos-homes or bos Crestias) and orthodox Catholic delegates. Constance, daughter of Louis VI of France, and most of the citizens of Albi and Lombers were present and the decision of the council in favour of orthodoxy is still preserved. The judges of the council had been decided upon by representatives of both the Cathars and the Catholics and the latter had been forced to agree to argue solely on New Testament grounds.Lea, 119. In 1166, Pons solemnly confirmed the decision of Lombers at a council in Capestang. However, the power and influence of the heretics was so demoralising to the faithful that some Cistercian monks from Villemagne near Agde abandoned their vows and their monastery to marry and the archbishop was unable to compel them to return without papal interference, which was probably ineffectual as well. In 1173, both Pons and Ermengard of Narbonne sent separate pleas to Louis VII of France for aid against, in Pons' words, \\"the oppression of heretics\\" which put \\"the ship of Saint Peter ... in danger of sinking.\\"Cheyette, 288. In 1176, Pons was granted all the vicecomital rights in the town of Ferrals by Ermengard of Narbonne \\"for his fidelity and service.\\"Cheyette, 133. Pons was a close ally of Ermengard and they shared, on very amicable terms, the lordship in the city of Narbonne. In 1178, Pons was part of a papal legation made up of the Cistercian abbot of Clairvaux Henry of Marcy, Jean des Bellesmains, Peter of Pavia, and Garin, Archbishop of Bourges which was destined to fight Catharism and those lords of Languedoc who supported it or refused to actively campaign against it, among other perceived persecutors of the Church.Cheyette, 308.Graham-Leigh, The Southern French Nobility, 105 n117. Pons was the only member of the legation who came from the region to which it was sent and he was therefore most intimately aware of its politics.Cheyette, 319. In 1179, he attended the Third Lateran Council.Graham- Leigh, The Southern French Nobility, 75. Upon his return, in accordance with the twenty-seventh canon of III Lateran, he pronounced excommunication on Raymond V of Toulouse, Roger II of Carcassonne, and Bernard Ato VI of Nîmes.Graham-Leigh, Hirelings and Shepherds, 1088.Graham-Leigh, The Southern French Nobility, 96. The twenty seventh canon prohibited the use of mercenaries, such as routiers, coterills, bascules, and Aragonese. In 1181, Henry of Marcy returned as legate to Languedoc and this time deposed Pons from his archdiocese. The exact reasons for his deposition are not known, though a thirteenth-century Cistercian chronicle from Clairvaux says that he was \\"ineffective and blameworthy\\", but such a statement lacks any specification of fault.Graham-Leigh, Hirelings and Shepherds, 1090, translates it \\"useless and reprehensible.\\" It is possible that archbishop had raised Henry's ire in the preceding legation by questioning the piety of Raymond of Toulouse, who had called in the Cistercians for aid against heresy, but who was an enemy of Pons close ally, Ermengard of Narbonne.Cheyette, 320. Or perhaps he had been too closely aligned with Ermengard's ally, Roger of Carcassonne, to whom the papal legates took great offence. Whatever the case, not only Pons, but also three archdeacons and the sacristan were removed from the church of Narbonne and Pope Lucius III described it as \\"deprived of all personnel.\\"Graham-Leigh, Hirelings and Shepherds, 1090.

Roger referred to himself as Count of Carcassonne on occasion. Béziers,Graham-Leigh, 163-164. Razès, and Albi from 1167 or 1171 until his death. Until 1177 he used the title proconsul, usually as proconsul de Bitteris (of Béziers), but he abandoned the usage when he became a vassal of the Crown of Aragon.Graham-Leigh, 160 and n218. The title may have signified that the proconsul was the representative of the consulate of Béziers, it may have been a continued tradition of the use of the term in Languedoc as it was when still a proconsular province of the Roman Empire and thus intended to show the Trencavel's authority over all Languedoc, or it may merely have been a fashionable and pompous way of saying \\"viscount.\\" In any case it was intended to make Roger out to be of higher rank and standing than his vicecomital titles made him. His government of his lands was characterised by increasing complexity, such as the development of the offices of seneschal and sub-vicar,Graham-Leigh, 136-137 and nn 56-63. but his later years are characterised by financial troubles and a \\"general malaise\\" perhaps brought about by his poor relations with the Church hierarchy in light of his favourable attitude towards Catharism.Graham-Leigh, 132. Roger was the elder of two sons of Raymond I Trencavel and Saure. As a child in 1153 he was placed in the \\"custody and service\\" of Ermengard of Narbonne.Cheyette, 347. Eventually he inherited all four of Raymond's viscounties on his death in 1167.Cheyette, 265. However, Raymond V of Toulouse objected to the young Roger and instead enfeoffed Roger-Bernard I of Foix with the viscounties in December 1167 at Narbonne. Roger rebelled. He retook Béziers in 1169 with the assistance of troops from Aragon and Catalonia.Graham-Leigh, 147-148. After taking the city, Roger brought the Aragonese inside to murder the citizens who had handed the city over to his rival. However, in November 1171, Raymond drew Roger away from Alfonso II of Aragon by enfeoffing him with the viscounties and depriving the count of Foix. Roger married the young Adalais, daughter of Raymond of Toulouse, in 1171.Cheyette, 277. It opened the only (brief) period of alliance between Roger and Raymond.Graham-Leigh, 99. Adalais' dowry was the town of Minerve, a fief of the King of France. In 1176, Roger held a public inquiry to prove his lordship of the village of Mèze.Graham-Leigh, 11. About the same time (c. 1175), Alfonso of Aragon held a public inquiry to prove that Carcassonne was his possession and that Roger II merely held it from him at his pleasure.Graham-Leigh, 12-13. In the late 1180s, Roger began the compilation of a cartulary to collect the charter evidence for his rule.Graham-Leigh, 14. The cartulary contained 248 folios and was written in proto-Gothic script. Roger was a close ally of Ermengard of Narbonne from 1171 onwards, when the viscount and viscountess swore oaths of mutual alliance.Cheyette, 168. In 1177, he joined an alliance with Ermengard and William VIII of Montpellier to prevent Raymond from seizing Narbonne. In 1179, he was forced to forswear his former alliance with Raymond of Toulouse and return to the fold of Alfonso of Aragon.Cheyette, 275.Graham-Leigh, 100. He recognised that he held his fiefs from Alfonso. Roger agreed to hold Minerve from the king of Aragon instead of the king of France, significant of a realignment in the politics of the lords of Languedoc with respect to central authority. Some have suggested that Roger was driven to the side of Alfonso by the results of the Third Lateran Council and by Raymond of Toulouse' request for assistance in dealing with heresy in his domains.Graham-Leigh, 105, who herself sees Roger as intensely opposed to any furtherance of Aragonese dominance in Languedoc (p. 111). Roger appears therefore as lenient towards heretics. Around 1175, Roger imprisoned Gerard, the bishop of Albi, probably over the disputed lordship of Albi.Graham-Leigh, 142.Cheyetter, 316. Roger succeeded in establishing a vicar (Pierre Raimond d'Hautpoul) in Albi between 1175 and 1177, but he was forced to come to humiliating terms with the bishop William of Dourgne in 1193.Graham-Leigh, 73. In 1178 Henry of Marcy, who was leading a papal legation in the region, marched on Albi, whence Roger fled to Ambialet, and the on Castres, where they declared him a heretic and excommunicated him after releasing the bishop Gerard.Cheyetter, 317. In 1179, he was excommunicated again by Pons d'Arsac for his \\"conspicuous lack of enthusiasm for the extirpation of heresy\\" under the twenty-seventh canon of the Third Lateran Council and the decretal Ad abolendam of Pope Lucius III.Graham-Leigh, 67-68. He was also accused of hiring routiers.Graham-Leigh, 75. In 1181, Henry of Marcy returned to the south of France and besieged Roger and his wife in Lavaur, which was promptly surrendered.Cheyetter, 319. In 1185, Alfonso was making war on Raymond over the possession of Provence. From Aix he travelled to Najac, where, probably in April, he made a treaty with Richard the Lionheart and with Roger against Raymond of Toulouse.Cheyetter, 334. Roger in gratitude followed Alfonso into Spain and to the siege of Valencia, where, in June, he adopted the king's son Alfonso II of Provence as his heir, even though his wife was expecting.Graham-Leigh, 111. Perhaps the adoption was cautionary in case the child of Adalais was a girl. Alfonso of Provence did not succeed Roger, rather that child, which was a boy named Raymond Roger, did. In 1188, Alfonso of Aragon came north of the Pyrenees again to defend Roger at Carcassonne, but he also granted away that viscounty as well as the Razès to Raimond-Roger of Foix in a move to dispossess the Trencavels entirely.Cheyette, 335. In 1189, Roger fell seriously ill and made his will. After his recovery in 1191, however, he gathered his vassals and made them swear fealty to his son, which they did. Sources *Cheyette, Fredric L.

He has represented clients in 46 states and 16 countries on issues involving property rights, constitutional rights, agriculture, eminent domain, commercial and financial disputes, public policy, and international disputes. His law practice has included individual cases, class actions, mediation, appellate advocacy in state and federal courts, regulatory disputes, testimony before congressional committees and state legislatures, and international arbitration. Ackerson has received Martindale-Hubbell's highest rating – AV Premier – for legal ability and ethics. He has been identified by his peers as a Super Lawyer and is listed in the American Registry, the Worldwide Registry, and Who's Who in the World. He is a member of the bar of the United States Supreme Court, numerous federal courts, the District of Columbia and his home state of Indiana. He is a member of the American Bar Association, the American Association for Justice, the International Society of Barristers, and other bar associations. His public positions have included Chief Counsel of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, nominee for the U.S. Congress, and representing the United States on trade and advisory missions to the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe. He organized and managed the first American law office in Egypt, and was a founder and president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt. Purdue University has recognized Ackerson as a distinguished alumnus and an \\"Old Master,\\" and has awarded Ackerson its honorary degree of Doctor of Agriculture, citing his \\"legal accomplishments that will have lasting impact on landowner rights.\\"  Background  Farm: The grandson of Swedish immigrants and the son of a farmer and a teacher, Ackerson grew up on his family's small dairy farm in Westfield, Indiana, where he attended Westfield public schools, was active in 4-H and other youth organizations, and was class president and valedictorian. In 2009 Ackerson was recognized as a member of the first class to be inducted into the Westfield Washington High School Hall of Fame. Purdue University: Ackerson earned a B.S. degree with distinction in Agricultural Economics at Purdue University, where he served as student body president, and received the G. A. Ross Award as the most outstanding male graduate. Ackerson joined FarmHouse Fraternity and later served on its International Board of Directors. During his freshman year at Purdue, Ackerson served as Indiana State President of the Future Farmers of America (FFA). Interim Period: During his sophomore year at Purdue Ackerson was elected National FFA President, a full-time position that required him to take a one- year leave from his formal education. As National FFA President, Ackerson presided over the desegregation of the FFA and the New Farmers of America (NFA), a parallel youth organization for African Americans in states that had previously practiced racial segregation. He spoke at conventions and high school commencements, and he met with educators, agricultural leaders, leaders of industry and elected officials across the nation and in the White House. Harvard Law School: Ackerson was awarded the Juris Doctor degree with distinction by the Harvard Law School where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. As a Harvard Law Review editor, he co-authored a student article on the role of community development corporations in economic development, which remains one of the Harvard Law Review's most comprehensive student- authored legal articles. Harvard University, John F. Kennedy School of Government: Ackerson also received the degree of Master in Public Policy from Harvard University, as a member of the first class of students in Harvard's joint degree program through the John F. Kennedy School of Government and Harvard Law School. One of Ackerson's Kennedy School thesis papers remains listed as a teaching tool. The Kennedy School on several occasions has asked Ackerson to join its delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Family: Ackerson lives in Potomac, Maryland. He and his wife, Sharon Carroll Ackerson, have four children and six grandchildren. Ackerson is a member and officer in of the Potomac Presbyterian Church.  Career  1971 – 1976: Indiana Law Practice: After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1971, Ackerson joined the Indianapolis law firm Barnes, Hickam, Pantzer & Boyd (now Barnes & Thornburg), where he tried cases before judges and juries in state and federal courts. Ackerson was active in many civic and public policy issues in Indiana, which he recalls as wonderful time of growth in an excellent law firm under the guidance of highly skilled and generous colleagues in an enjoyable community. (Following his experience on the staff of the United States Senate, Ackerson returned to practice law in Indiana). 1976 – 1979: United States Senate Staff: In 1976 Ackerson accepted a staff position in the U.S. Senate to serve under the leadership of Indiana Senator Birch Bayh, a member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution. Ackerson held the positions of Chief Counsel and Executive Director of the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution. Equal Rights Amendment: As Chief Counsel, Ackerson was a leading Senate staff member to assist with Senate consideration and passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. The Equal Rights Amendment (or ERA) would have ensured equal rights of women under all provisions of the Constitution. The resolution passed both Houses and was signed by President Carter, but it failed to receive the required positive vote by legislatures in three-fourths of the States. President Carter recognized Ackerson's work in the Senate in support of the Equal Rights Amendment by presenting Ackerson with one of the pens that he used to sign the Resolution that had been passed by both Houses. Direct Popular Election of the President: Ackerson was the lead staff member in the U. S. Senate to assist with consideration and passage of the proposed Direct Election Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Direct Election Amendment would have abolished the Electoral College and provided for direct popular election of the President. This amendment received a majority vote in the Senate and the House of Representatives, but the resolution fell short of the votes necessary to overcome a Senate filibuster. That was the only time in U.S. history that a resolution for the direct election of the President received a majority vote in both Houses of Congress. Bio Fuel Incentives: In addition to his responsibilities involving the U.S. Constitution, Ackerson also served as Senator Birch Bayh's advisor on agricultural policy. In that role, Ackerson proposed the first legislation passed by Congress and enacted into law to provide incentives for the production of alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. The law was co-authored on a bipartisan basis by Democratic Senator Bayh and Republican Senator Bob Dole and is credited with much of the early success in the development and use of alternative, environmentally sound and economically beneficial fuels from biological sources. University & Small Business Patent Protection (Bayh-Dole Act): Ackerson also proposed legislation to permit universities, colleges and small businesses to obtain patents on inventions that had resulted in part from research funded by federal grants. Such patents had previously been held by the federal government, which made commercialization difficult if not impossible and dampened university research efforts. Co-authored by Senator Birch Bayh and Senator Bob Dole, the law is known as the Bayh-Dole Act. It has been credited with enabling public access and benefit from inventions; stimulating increased university research and practical commercial applications, generating an estimated revenues in the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars for higher education, and creating tens of thousands of jobs. 1979 – 1982: Return to Private Law Practice: Ackerson returned to Indiana and became a partner in the Noblesville law firm of Campbell Kyle Proffitt – a highly regarded law firm in Hamilton County where Ackerson spent his youth on the Ackerson family's farm. Ackerson continued his law practice as a trial attorney in state and federal courts, and was the Democratic nominee for Congress in Indiana's Fifth Congressional District where he was defeated by the long-time and widely respected Republican Congressman, Bud Hillis. 1982 – 1985: First American Law Firm in Egypt: In a dramatic change of his career, Ackerson's law practice turned to international legal issues in 1982, as he accepted a partnership in one of the nation's best-known law firms, Sidley & Austin (Now Sidley Austin). Ackerson had worked with Sidley & Austin's partners in successful class action litigation, but the firm recruited him for a bigger role – to open the first American law firm office in Egypt. Ackerson opened the office with a distinguished Egyptian lawyer and former diplomat, Gamal Naguib, and the firm was named Sidley & Austin & Naguib. Sidley & Austin & Naguib: Ackerson and Naguib staffed the new Egyptian office with distinguished lawyers who had served as judges in Egypt's highest courts, prominent retired diplomats, professors from Cairo University Law School, well educated young Egyptian lawyers and lawyers from England, Sweden and the United States. was managing partner of the office which took on national and international significance, representing American, European Egyptian, Middle Eastern and Asian clients, along with prominent investors, contractors international organizations. Ackerson's practice included international arbitration in Europe and the Middle East, international investment and trade advice and disputes and diplomatic assignments. Egyptians lawyers in the office practiced in those international areas and also in Egyptian courts and regulatory matters. Egyptian-American Responsibilities: Ackerson became well known in Egyptian legal, business and governmental circles. He was a founder of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt and held the offices of Vice President for Legal Affairs, and then President. AmCham Egypt, as it was called, became actively involved in the progress of the private sector in Egypt. The organization held monthly meetings that attracted prominent speakers, including members of the Cabinets of both Egypt and the United States, as well as prominent business leaders and innovators from the U.S., Egypt and elsewhere. Ackerson also served on the board of the Bilateral Fulbright Commission. 1985 – 1991: Sidley & Austin in the U.S. In 1985 Ackerson returned to the United States and continued his practice as a Sidley & Austin partner. He continued his international practice and also returned to litigation of substantial cases in federal and state courts across the country. Among his successful cases were the largest patent infringement cases at the time in terms of potential damages; highly controverted international trade disputes, litigation arising from a corporate acquisition between twi Fortune 500 companies, federal regulatory litigation and appeals, litigation to save the 37 banks in the Farm Credit System during the Farm Credit financial crisis of the 1980s, continuing into the early 1990s, and human rights litigation. 1991 – Present: The Ackerson Group—Ackerson Kauffman Fex: In 1991 Ackerson left the big firm practice to form the law firm that continues to bear his name. The name has changed to include his valued colleagues and is now Ackerson Kauffman Fex. Despite its size as a small firm, Ackerson Kauffman Fex has taken on some of the nation's and the world's giants – including governments and governmental bodies and some of the nation's largest companies. Ackerson Kauffman Fex has been most widely recognized for its successful litigation on behalf of property owners whose land has been taken or used in violation of the law or those who have been threatened with unlawful or unjustified assertions of the power of eminent domain. Ackerson and his firm have been involved in landmark cases in Federal Courts of Appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court and have successfully litigated class actions on behalf of landowners in 46 six of the 50 states. Newspapers and magazines, including the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and others across the nation have reported on the Firm's cases, and both the National Law Journal and American Lawyer have featured the firm's cases on their cover pages. [2] International development: Among Ackerson's professional interests are constitutional issues, civil rights, and human rights, examples of which appear above. He also has a long interest in international development and cooperation, and some of his experiences in those areas are the following: U.S. Trade and Development Missions: Ackerson has participated in United States sponsored and U.S. based international trade and development missions. He was a member of a U. S. Department of Agriculture Trade and Development Mission to several countries in the Middle East, including Egypt and Yemen, and proposed new investment laws that were adopted by subsequently adopted. U.S. Market Economy Advisory Mission: He also was a member of a U.S. Advisory Delegation that had been invited to the former Soviet Union by Secretary General Mikhail Gorbachev to advise Russian and Soviet lawyers on the application of market principles to advance Gobachev's plan for transition to a market economy. Ackerson and others in the U.S. Government supported delegation spoke to hundreds of lawyers from across the Soviet Union. Student Exchange Programs: Ackerson's interest and involvement in international development have also included initiating the process to establish student exchange program for U.S. students in rural areas or with agricultural interests to share experiences in each other's countries, communities, and agricultural pursuits. The first such program was established with the government of Mexico, and was followed by other student exchange programs in Europe and Asia. Middle East Law, Policy, and Development: During Ackerson's three years as managing partner of the first office established by an American law firm in Egypt – and continuing after his return to the U.S. – he advised clients and participated in international investment and economic development issues in Egypt and elsewhere. While in Egypt Ackerson was one of the founders of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt and became its president. Ackerson also was a member of the board of the Bilateral Fulbright Commission in Egypt. Yemen's improved investment law was based on Ackerson's advice. Separately, Ackerson was leader of the U.S. sponsored advisory delegation to Kazakhstan that followed the meetings in Russia on transition to market economy.

Early life Born in Manchester, his father was a Church of England clergyman and a scholar, and his mother had been a school mistress. Hopkinson attended prep school on the Lancashire coast and then St Edward's School, Oxford. From there he went to Pembroke College, reading Classical Moderations (Class II, 1925) and Greats (Class III, 1927).Oxford University Calendar 1932, Oxford : Oxford University Press, 1932, pp.254, 310. His philosophy tutor for Greats was R. G. Collingwood.T. Hopkinson, Of This Our Time, London : Hutchinson, 1982, pp.85–6, 93–4. Early work Tom Hopkinson first worked in advertising and publicity, then became a magazine assistant editor in 1934. He was soon working for Stefan Lorant on Weekly Illustrated magazine, and wrote short stories and novels during his free time. He also assisted Lorant on Lilliput magazine, and then on Picture Post magazine from 1938 to 1940. When Lorant left permanently for America in July 1940, Hopkinson became editor of Picture Post, in 1940, remaining until 1950. It was Hopkinson who began photojournalist Bert Hardy's connection with Picture Post. Middle career Hopkinson defended his staff's editorial independence fiercely, and his publisher, Sir Edward Hulton, a Conservative Party member for most of his career, did not always appreciate Hopkinson's left-wing views, which affected Picture Post more strongly than the occasional right-wing views which also found their way into that magazine. While working for the Picture Post in the Congo, Hopkinson reportedly saved a man's life by standing over him to prevent a mob beating the man to death.\\"The Bystanders: photographers who didn't step in to help – in pictures\\", The Guardian, Saturday 28 July 2012 In October 1950, after photojournalist Bert Hardy and writer James Cameron returned to London from their Korean War coverage, Hopkinson tried to go to press with their coverage of United Nations atrocities in Pusan. Hulton stopped the presses, fearing that coverage would \\"give aid and comfort to the enemy\\". Hopkinson persisted and Hulton sacked him. During the next six and one-half years, Picture Post was led by a revolving door of editors, many of whom did not do well for the magazine, which had been the leading picture magazine in Britain during World War II and for at least five years thereafter. Hopkinson's became editor of South Africa's Drum magazine in 1958. He encouraged the South Africa photojournalist Peter Magubane, who was covering the anti-apartheid struggle. He travelled regularly to Ghana and Nigeria during this time, organising the local editions of Drum. Hopkinson provided the textual material for the South African volume of the Life World Library published by Time Inc in 1965. Later career When Hopkinson left Drum, he went on to teach journalism in British universities and studied United States journalism schools. In 1969 he was in Malta advising on the setting up of a Journalism Course. He was founding director of the Centre for Journalism Studies at University College in Cardiff, Wales, from 1970 to 1975. Later, he returned to Oxford. He continued his habit of writing short stories, novels, and also wrote a memoir, Of This Our Time, about his life from 1905 up to 1950. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1978. Family life Hopkinson married three times, his wives were: Antonia White, Gerti Deutsch, and Dorothy Hopkinson. He was the father of three children: Lyndall Hopkinson Passerini, Nicolette Hopkinson Roeske, and Amanda Hopkinson. Other works Hopkinson and his last wife, Dorothy, co-authored Much Silence (Gollancz, 1974), a biography of Meher Baba. He and Dorothy met Baba in London in 1952, became devotees, and were considerably influenced by him.\\"The Silent Messenger\\", Part 5 \\"The Inner Voice\\" Lady Hopkinson died in August 1993, and Hopkinson later rewrote and expanded their work on Baba into a larger version, The Silent Messenger: The Life & Work of Meher Baba, which was completed but apparently never published.\\"Glow International\\", Nov.1993, pp.23–24 ReferencesFurther reading * Of This Our Time: A Journalist's Story, 1905–50, by Tom Hopkinson, London: Hutchinson, 1982. * The Picture Post Album, by Robert Kee, London: Barrie & Jenkins, 1989. * Nothing to Forgive: A Daughter's Life of Antonia White – Lyndall Hopkinson, 1988.
