He won eight of his fourteen races and is most noted for his performances as a four-year-old in 2001 when his wins included the International Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Background Bred by the racing interests of Dubai's Sheikh Hamdan al Maktoum, his sire Bahri was almost exclusively a miler who won two Group One races at that distance. Sakhee was from the mare Thawakib, a winner of the 1993 Group II Ribblesdale Stakes whose sire was the fourteen-time Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland, Sadler's Wells. Trained by John L. Dunlop, Sakhee raced under the Godolphin banner. Racing career Sakhee won two of his three starts at age two. As a three-year-old in 2000, the colt won the Sandown Classic Trial and the Dante Stakes then ran second by a length to Sinndar in The Derby. In the Eclipse Stakes he suffered a muscular problem and finished fourth to winner, Giant's Causeway. At the end of the 2000 racing season he underwent surgery to remove a bone chip in a knee. Godolphin gave Saeed bin Suroor the job of conditioning Sakhee for his four-year-old racing campaign. Being prepared for top-level races, he was entered and won the Steventon Stakes Listed race. In his next outing of 2001, he dominated the competition, winning the Group One International Stakes by seven lengths. Sent to Longchamp Racecourse in Paris, France for October's prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Sakhee once again dominated his opponents and won by six lengths over the previously undefeated filly, Aquarelliste. In his final start of 2001, Sakhee was sent to the United States to compete in the 2001 Breeders' Cup Classic at New York's Belmont Park. Racing on dirt for the first time in his career, he finished second by a nose to Tiznow. Sent back to racing at age five, Sakhee won his first race then finished third on the dirt behind winner Street Cry in the 2002 Dubai World Cup. In the final race of his career, he ran second on turf in the G3 Prix Gontaut-Biron. Stud career In October 2002, Sakhee was retired to breeding duty at Sheikh Hamdan's Shadwell Stud. To date, the most successful of his offspring have been Sakhee's Secret who in 2007 earned his fourth straight win in the Group One July Cup at Newmarket Racecourse, Presvis (Queen Elizabeth II Cup, Dubai Duty Free) and Tin Horse (Poule d'Essai des Poulains).

He started his career as a mechanic, but after 1945 he was a journalist and editor of magazines and newspapers. Via local politics in his native Namsos he was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1961, serving six terms in total. He was the President of the Storting for two of these terms, from 1973 to 1981. He was also known as a prolific book writer, many of his books having a direct connection to his political life. Career He was born in Namsos as the son of mechanic H√•kon Hansen (1895‚Äì1963) and housewife Agnes Selnes (1900‚Äì1924). Before 1945 he worked as a mechanic himself, and since he only had primary education, he took extra education in the evenings. From 1945 to 1948 he worked as a journalist and subeditor in the temperance magazine Menneskevennen. He then worked as editor- in-chief of Firdaposten from 1948 to 1951 and as a journalist in Namdal Arbeiderblad from 1951 to 1961.. Retrieved 7 April 2009. Hansen's mother died from tuberculosis, and due to his social background and environment it was no surprise that he joined the labour movement. He started his party political career in the Workers' Youth League, and sat in its central committee as secretary from 1947 to 1948. He was a member of Namsos municipal council from 1955 to 1963, and served as a deputy representative to the Norwegian Parliament from Nord-Tr√∏ndelag during the term 1958-1961\\\\. During the same period he chaired the party chapter in Namdalen. In 1961 he was elected for his first proper term in the Norwegian Parliament. He would be re-elected on five occasions, his last term ending in 1985. When the first cabinet Bratteli held office between 1971 and 1972, Hansen became leader of the Labour Party parliamentary council. From 1973 to 1981 he served as President of the Storting. Also, he was asked three times to become a government minister, but declined. He was regarded by himself and others as a legislator first and foremost, and in 1985 the newspaper Dagbladet labelled him \\"the last Eidsvoll man\\". From 1981 to 1985 he took up his work from after 1945, as chair of the informal parliamentary temperance group. He was also a member of several public boards and committees, chairing Statens naturvernr√•d from 1963 to 1965 and the board of Direktoratet for vilt og ferskvannsfisk from 1977 to 1980. From 1985 to 1992 he was a member of the Arts Council Norway, and from 1981 to 1983 he was a member of the presidium of the Nordic Council. He chaired the board of Fosdalen Bergverk from 1975 to 1977, and was a member of the board of DNO, Det Norske Luftfartsselskap from 1974 to 1977 and Aschehoug from 1977 to 1985. Hansen was a supporter of NATO and the European Community, chairing the Norwegian Atlantic Committee from 1966 to 1985 and being a board member of the European Movement in Norway from 1971 to 1975. He wrote several books, mostly debate books on foreign policy and security policy. He also published several memoirs about his time in politics and the Parliament: Der er det godt √• sitte (1984), Fra min plass.

It is sometimes given the English name paintbrush, not to be confused with Castilleja species which also have this name. It is an evergreen bulbous perennial geophyte, prized horticulturally for its unusual appearance and extreme tolerance of neglect. H. albiflos is the only Haemanthus species found in both winter and summer rainfall regions, and has a mainly coastal distribution from the southern Cape through the Eastern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal, showing a preference for cool, shady spots. Etymology The specific epithet albiflos means \\"white flower\\" in English. As a pot plant it has been called \\"elephant's tongue\\" and \\"elephant ear\\" - for its leaves - or \\"shaving-brush (or paintbrush) plant\\" - for its flowers. Description The upper half of the bulb is usually exposed and bright green. Since it produces a pair of leaves once a year and is evergreen, the plant may have up to three pairs of leaves. The leaves are up to long, and may have a covering of short, soft hairs, and occasionally yellow spots on the upper surface. In late autumn and winter, brush-like umbels comprising multiple tiny white florets are borne on stout stems, followed by fleshy white oval fruits. The whole plant grows to tall by wide.Jacquin, Nicolaus Joseph von. 1797. Plantarum Rariorum Horti Caesarei Schoenbrunnensis Descriptiones et Icones 1: 31. Cultivation H. albiflos is hardy down to about but does not survive prolonged freezing temperatures. This is a very successful indoor plant where it is too tender to be grown outdoors, and thrives on \\"healthy neglect\\". It prefers not to be in full sun, but is very tolerant of under- watering, and flowers better if restricted in a small pot. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Propagation It reproduces readily by adventitious buds or offsets, which may be removed when the flowering period is over. Offsets can be separated carefully from the parent plant to be grown on, preferably when they are fairly well developed, and ensuring that there is some root on them. Fruits are only occasionally produced indoors, presumably for lack of pollinating insects, but when one does produce a seed, this can be sown, and should grow, though it is a slower process. With very little care, this plant can be propagated for many years.

Since the administrative reform in 1996, Thiaroye has been divided into independent communes, Thiaroye-Gare, Thiaroye-sur-Mer and Thiaroye-Kao (or Djiddah Thiaroye Kao), with Guinaw-Rail Nord, Guinaw-Rail Sud (both to the west), and Tivaouane-Diacksao (to the east) split off and separating Thiaroye-sur-Mer from the other two inland communes. History The village of Thiaroye was founded sometime around 1800, and as the city of Dakar, created by the French, expanded in the 20th century, Thiaroye was slowly merged into the larger city. Thiaroye is most known for, and its name has become emblematic of, a single incident in 1944: the Thiaroye Massacre by French forces. On 1 December 1944, at the barracks of Thiaroye, African soldiers clashed with the French state. The uprising involved nearly 1280 African ex-POWs in the first contingent to be repatriated from Europe in 1944. The event was defined as \\"mutinous\\" because the men were partially armed, uniformed and under military discipline. The cause of the soldiers' protest was the failure of the French authorities to provide them with back-pay and demobilization premiums. The event in Thiaroye sent shockwaves throughout French West Africa. The uprising reflected a change in attitude towards France. The African ex-POWs had acquired a heightened consciousness of themselves as Africans united by their shared experience in suffering. Administration and politics Thiaroye is the seat of Thiaroye Arrondissement in the Pikine Department (r√©gion de Dakar). The three communes are governed as a single entity, but retain some administrative independence. Geography Thiaroye-Gare, closest to Dakar, is bordered by Pikine (a city of almost 1 million people), Nimzat, Yeumbeul, Thiaroye Kao, Diaksaw and Darou Rahmane. Thiaroye-sur-Mer is bordered by Bel-Air, Hann-Montagne, Pikine, Guinaw-Rails, Tivaouane, Diammagueun, Mbaw Gou Ndaw and Gor√©e. Thiaroye-Kao, border Yeumbeul, Boun and Darou Rahmane. Population Traders set up along the autoroute in Thiaroye. As of 2002 the population of Thiaroye-Gare has grown to 21,873, Thiaroye-sur-Mer to 36,602, and that of Thiaroye-Kao to 90,586. As of 2007 official estimates put the population of the three communes at 24,867, 41,612 and 102,985.  Economic activity  Thiaroye continues to be integrated economically into Dakar, with much of the population commuting to the city center for work. Thiaroye-Gare is named for the large train station on the line leading to Dakar, and continues to be a major transport center. Goods and people travelling to and from Dakar must pass here, and it is one of the reasons neighboring Pikine was founded as a relocation camp in 1952. Small scale industry, artisanal trades and commerce make up much of the rest of the economy, though unemployment remains high, as in other outer suburbs, which see regular immigration from rural areas.  Pollution  One outgrowth of small scale industry in Thiaroye has been a high rate of pollution and pollution-related diseases. One recent form of income, the salvaging of automobile batteries for products including lead, has created a highly publicised wave of childhood illnesses. In the past, local blacksmiths of the Thiaroye Sur Mer area had salvaged lead from car batteries to fashion into net weights for the nearby fishing industry. In the mid-2000s, as the world price of lead increased, purchasing agents from India offered large payments for lead, leading locals to sift tailings from smithyies' and breakers' yards for lead pellets, usually by hand. Lead poisoning of children born to workers, or those who were exposed to the lead dust created by sifting, climbed. As of the end of 2008m, this pollution has been blamed for at least 18 deaths and hundreds of poisoning related illnesses, along with uncounted deaths of animals and human miscarriages. A much publicised government cleanup campaign has, according to the World Health Organization, been ineffective, and plans are under study to move entire neighbourhoods in the town.Lead for car batteries poisons an African town. Heidi Vogt, Associated Press. 3 January 2009.  Market  Thiaroye-Gare market is situated along the border with Pikine near the Thiaroye station, and is the largest produce market in the Dakar region, fed by suppliers from Nyayes, Cap- Vert, Casamance, and Keur Massar. The train line (the Petit train bleu) from Dakar stops at the very center of the market, making it easy for city residents to shop there, and avoiding the higher city prices. Around the produce market have grown markets for general manufactures, one of the largest lumber markets in Dakar, and wholesale companies supplying markets in city center. There are over 4500 formal traders, almost that many street sellers and a thousand or more wholesale shops surrounding the market. The lumber market has also drawn artisanal woodcarvers and an industry selling wood for barbarque cooking at festivals and family celebrations.Laurence Wilhelm.

She briefly served as an auxiliary cruiser with Regia Marina early in World War II before becoming an auxiliary transport with the Imperial Japanese Navy later in her career. Details and construction In the second half of the 1930s, Ministry of the Colonies of the Kingdom of Italy placed an order for four ships to transport bananas from Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland to Naples. These ships had to have a large enough cargo capacity, and big endurance to be able to sail without any intermediate stops. These four refrigerating vessels were put under control of the Regia Azienda Monopolio delle Banane (RAMB) with headquarters in Rome. Two, including Ramb II were built by CRDA at Monfalcone, and two at the Ansaldo shipyards in Sestri Ponente. Ramb II was laid down on December 14, 1936, launched on June 7, 1937, and delivered to Regia Azienda Monopolio delle Banane (RAMB) on September 6, 1937. RAMB II being launched at Monfalcone (1937). Medium-small but very modern vessels for the era, the four RAMBs could carry approximately 2,400 tons of cargo, as well as twelve passengers. Two passengers could be accommodated in a luxury apartment with a bedroom, living room and facilities, and ten in twin bedrooms. The ship had a private deck reserved for passengers (separate from the crew), a dining room with views, and two verandas for the smokers. Passenger accommodations were air- conditioned. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . RAMB II was assessed at 3,685 GRT and . The vessel had a steel hull, and was propelled by two 2-stroke single-cycle single-acting diesel engines, each one of seven cylinders of diameter by stroke, that drove two screw propellers and moved the ship at up to . According to legislative provision, these ships were constructed with the possibility of transforming them into auxiliary cruisers, so there was enough space left on deck to accommodate four cannons. Cannons and the mat√©riel required for the military upgrade were stored in Massawa for two ships, and in Naples for the other two. Service During the two years of peace Ramb II transported bananas from Italian Somaliland to Venice, Naples and Genoa, and carried various goods to Mogadishu on her return journeys. On August 7, 1938, while in Trieste, there was an explosion on board of the ship, killing eight men. On April 9, 1940, she was requisitioned by the Regia Marina and converted into an auxiliary cruiser. The refitting work took place at the Eritrean port of Massawa. After conversion, she was armed with four 120/40 cannons and two 13.2 mm Breda anti- aircraft guns. With Italy's entry into World War II on June 10, 1940, Ramb II became a part of the Italian Navy's Red Sea Flotilla. During her short career as an auxiliary cruiser, Ramb II never ventured out and remained berthed in Massawa due to lack of allied merchant traffic and significant presence of Royal Navy in the Red Sea. With the start of Operation Compass in North Africa and the defeat of the Italian troops at Sidi Barrani on 9-12 December 1940, it became clear that it would be impossible for Italian troops in Libya to reach Italian East Africa to break its isolation. The fuel supplies were dwindling and were projected to be exhausted by June 1941. Dupuis, pp.24-26 In anticipation of the inevitable fall of the colony, a plan was developed to send as many ships as possible to Japan or occupied France and to destroy all other ships that could not make the journey. Colonial ship Eritrea, Ramb II and Ramb I were among the ships that were sent out to the Far East. Ramb II left Massawa on 22 February 1941, after Ramb I and Eritrea which departed earlier, with both auxiliary cruisers heading to Nagasaki, and Eritrea to Kobe. After departing from Massawa, all three ships first passed by Perim evading the Royal Navy ships and Royal Air Force aircraft based at Aden and Socotra, then the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden and entered the Indian Ocean. On 27 February 1941 Ramb I was intercepted and sunk by cruiser HMNZS Leander, but the other two vessels sailed across the Indian Ocean and the Sunda Sea and safely arrived in Japan. Ramb II reached Kobe on 23 March 1941. The Italian government wanted to use the ship as a commerce raider against British merchant traffic in the Indian Ocean, however, since Japan was still neutral, the Japanese government was opposed to the idea of an Italian raider operating from the Japanese ports. The next day the vessel departed Kobe and dismounted her armament in international waters, and then returned to Japan. Her name was changed to Calitea II in May 1941 and the ship was transferred to the Triestine Line. Ramb II then sailed to Tianjin, where she like other Italian merchant vessels was visited by Admiral Carlo Balsamo, a naval attache in Tokyo, who was inspecting ships available to carry natural rubber from the Far East to occupied France. Calitea II was not selected for the task due to her limited available cargo space for such a long journey. Dupuis, pp.141-142 In December 1941 Calitea II was chartered by the Japanese government as a cargo vessel, while retaining her Italian crew. She was officially chartered into the Imperial Japanese Navy as a stores ship in September 1942 and underwent additional refrigeration construction at Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. shipyard. Calitea II departed for her first trip on November 30, 1942, from Kobe to Southeast Asia, arriving in Surabaya on December 23. The vessel was engaged in inter-island service throughout 1943, carrying supplies and troops when necessary. The ship returned to Kobe for repairs on August 24, 1943. After Italy signed Armistice of Cassibile on September 8, 1943, her Italian crew scuttled the ship at Kobe to prevent the vessel from falling into Japanese hands. In Japanese service Calitea II was refloated by the Japanese, and on October 3 1943 renamed Ikutagawa Maru and assigned call sign JXBY. On November 30, 1943, she was officially registered as an auxiliary transport ship. After completing her repairs in December, she proceeded to Sasebo, where she became part of the Southwest Area Fleet. Ikutagawa Maru departed Moji for her first mission under the Japanese flag on January 7, 1944, as part of convoy No. 127 consisting of seven other merchant vessels, and destroyer and minesweeper serving as escorts. On January 10, 1944, US submarine sighted and attacked the convoy in the approximate position sinking three vessels. Throughout 1944 the ship continued carrying supplies throughout the island ports of South East Asia, such as Makassar, Surabaya, Ambon and others. On November 4, 1944, she ran aground just off Cape Agal but managed to refloat herself a few hours later and arrive safely at Banggi Island. On January 5, 1945, Ikutagawa Maru departed Manila escorted by destroyers and . Next day, the convoy was attacked by the US destroyer , who damaged Hinoki, temporarily disabling her, and forcing both Japanese destroyers to retreat to Manila, while Ikutagawa Maru continued on to Cap Saint-Jacques. On January 12, 1945, as part of \\"Operation Gratitude\\" designed to support the liberation of Luzon in the Philippines, US Navy airplanes of Task Force 38 launched massive air strikes on ports, airfields and other military installations of Indochina, mainly located in and around Saigon. During the attack, Ikutagawa Maru along with several other vessels was sunk in the approximate position .

The film follows the band for three years as they are relocated between various refugee camps in Guinea, and concludes with their return to Freetown and the recording of their first studio album, Living Like a Refugee. It originally premiered in November 2005 in Los Angeles at the American Film Institute's Film Fest, winning the Grand Jury Prize for best documentary. It was later shown on the American PBS television show POV in June 2007.  Synopsis  The band's leader, Reuben Koroma, and his wife Grace fled the violence in Sierra Leone, ending up in the Kalia refugee camp in Guinea. There they ran into Franco John Langba, a friend from the Freetown music scene. They began to make music together. Later, when they were transferred to the remote Sembakounya camp, they found three more musicians - Arahim (\\"Jah Voice\\"), Mohammed Bangura and Alhadji Jeffrey Kamara (\\"Black Nature\\") - and some instruments and equipment, and the band was formed. It was in this camp that they were discovered by the American filmmakers Zach Niles and Banker White, and Canadian singer-songwriter Chris Valen in August 2002. With the help of the United Nations Refugee Agency, they were preparing to tour the other refugee camps. Niles and White tagged along. Eventually, the band returned to Freetown to record their first album, Living Like a Refugee.

Since their return to Freetown in 2004, the band has toured extensively to raise awareness for humanitarian causes. Their story is documented in the 2005 documentary film Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars. Performing at SXSW in 2006 Their debut album, Living Like a Refugee, was released on the label Anti in Europe on September 25, 2006 and in the US on September, 26 2006. Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars' second studio album, Rise & Shine, was released March 23, 2010 by Cumbancha, and earned 2010 Album of the Year on the World Music Charts Europe. The album was produced by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, recorded at Piety Street Studio in New Orleans and features local guest musicians Trombone Shorty, Washboard Chaz, and Bonerama. The band's third studio album, Radio Salone, was released on April 24, 2012 by Cumbancha. The album was produced by Victor Axelrod, aka Ticklah and recorded at Dunham Studios in Brooklyn, NY. Marking the band's 10th anniversary, their most recent album Libation was released on March 18, 2014. It features elements of highlife and reggae as well as Afro-Latin rhythms. The album was recorded at Lane Gibson Recording & Mastering, produced by Chris Velan, and mixed by Iestyn Polson. The band is formed of musicians Reuben M. Koroma (vocals), Ashade Pearce (vocals, rhythm guitar), Jahson Gbassay Bull (keyboard, organ, rhythm guitar), Alhaji Jeffrey Kamara aka Black Nature (rap, vocals, percussion), Mohamed Kamara aka Makengo (vocals, percussion), Augustine Kobina Valcarcel (lead guitar), Dennis Bakarr Sannoh (bass guitar, vocals), and Christopher Wagbay Davies (drum kit, percussion).  History  In the early years of the civil war, Freetown remained on the outskirts of the most violent areas, but was attacked by rebels in the late 1990s. Among those who fled the country were musicians Reuben Koroma, his wife Grace, and Franco (Francis Langba), friends from the Freetown music scene who reconnected in the Kalia Refugee Camp in Guinea. There they began making music before being transferred to the remote Sembakounya Refugee Camp, where Arahim (Abdul Rahim Kamara), Mohammed Bangura, and Alhadji Jeffrey Kamara (\\"Black Nature\\") joined the band. A Canadian relief agency supplied the group with two old electric guitars, a microphone, and a basic sound system. One day in August 2002, American documentary filmmakers Zach Niles and Banker White, and Canadian singer-songwriter Chris Velan encountered the group during rehearsal. They had been searching nearby refugee camps in Guinea for stories like the Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars, which could \\"balance the Western media's focus on the region's violence with a sense of African society's beauty and resilience.\\" At the time, the band was preparing to embark on a tour of Guinean refugee camps with the help of the United Nations refugee agency. The filmmakers followed their tour for three years, recording their joyous receptions, the traumas they faced, and the production of their first album, Living Like a Refugee, back in Freetown.  International recognition  The 2005 documentary film Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars, their three albums, and U.S. tours helped expand their following, leading to performances at New York‚Äôs Central Park SummerStage, Japan‚Äôs Fuji Rock Festival and the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival. On December 15, 2006 they appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The All Stars also contributed a song to the Blood Diamond film soundtrack, participated in the U2 tribute album in the Name of Love: Africa Celebrates U2, and earned praise and backing from Sir Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, Ice Cube (an executive producer for the band's documentary film), and Angelina Jolie. One of \\"the most surreal moments of their climb to fame\\" was their performance opening for Aerosmith in November 2006 at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut. Genre and musical style Although Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars' music has been described as having a reggae feel, it is more directly influenced by the baskeda folk music of Sierra Leone which \\"is close to reggae in sound and spirit.\\" Writing in The Independent, Andy Morgan describes this similarity as: Other styles evident in their albums include the West African sounds of palm-wine (or maringa), gumbe, and gbute vange, a music of the Mende people. Much of their music features the modern sounds of electric guitars, bass, and drum kits, but in their most recent album Libation, their \\"unplugged\\" style is a \\"return in a way to the days in the refugee camps when the band had to make do with whatever instruments they could round up or make by hand, and do without amplification and electronics.\\" Performing at SXSW in 2006 Discography *Living Like a Refugee (2006) *Rise & Shine (2010) *Radio Salone (2012) *Libation (2014) Filmography *Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars (2005) External links * Official site *Cumbancha artist's page *Live at the Jazz Caf√©, London Gig review, 6 July 2007 References Category:Sierra Leonean refugees Category:Sierra Leonean musical groups Category:2002 establishments in Guinea ","title":"Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars"},{"id":"12780384","text":"Nadavayal is a town near Sultan Bathery in Wayanad district, Kerala, India.

It was one of the front-line of fortresses which were built to defend the royal city of Loundun at the beginning of the Hundred Years' War in 1340‚Äì1345. It played this military role until 1372. It then became a feudal manor and one of the estates of aristocratic families associated with the Courts of the French Kings and the Dukes of Anjou. The buildings inside the main rampart wall were rebuilt in the 16th century in the Renaissance style, as the home of a series of Protestant families in the French Wars of Religion. It escaped destruction both by Cardinal Richelieu in the early 17th century and again in the French Revolution, but was little more than a ruin by the 1940s. It has been restored in three phases since 1950, and now is one of the most complete fortresses of the 14th century.  Architecture  The castle overlooks and dominates the valley of the Dive, and was one of a string of fortresses along the limestone ridge. It is an octagonal fortress, surrounded by a dry moat. It was probably built on a previous fortress, and follows a typical Templar design. The main rampart walls are built of squared blocks of \\"tuffeau\\", the local soft limestone, excavated from the dry moat. The walls are built directly on the limestone outcrop and rise to a height of about 8‚Äì10 metres above the moat. The moat itself is excavated about 3‚Äì4 metres into the underlying limestone, and was originally protected by an outer wall. This has now disappeared, the stones having been reused to build the village houses. The walls are protected on the eight corners by semi-circular towers. The towers originally all had machicolations, the overhanging part around the top of the towers, which was a recent innovation in military architecture of the time, and made it even more difficult to scale the walls. The change from square to round towers also gave better resistance to cannonballs. The machiolations now only remain on the tower to the right of the main entrance. The main gate was protected by two larger towers, and access was by a fixed stone bridge across the moat, but with a drawbridge on the last 3 metres. It was replaced by an extension of the fixed bridge in the 17th century. The main entrance is vaulted in the Plantagenet style, with stables and guard rooms to right and left, and the entrance to the vaulted spiral staircase in the main tower. The buildings in the courtyard date from the 14th and 17th centuries: The vaulted store rooms and granary on the south-west side are part of the original 14th-century construction. Those on the north-west side are from the 17th century, built against the original inner fortification wall. The buildings on the north-east and south-east were already ruined in the 17th century, and their foundations are now part of the embankment to the ramparts. Excavation of the moat into the limestone gave access to a limestone wall into which homes and farm buildings were excavated ‚Äì both under the castle and under the outer wall. The latter were extended into a substantial underground village in the 14th century as a safe haven from the pillaging bands that roamed the countryside in the period from 1356‚Äì1372. Many of the rooms around the moat were inhabited well into the 19th century, and some were still inhabited in the 1920s, within living memory of people in the village. In 1900, the population of Ranton still numbered about 600, mainly engaged in viticulture and stone extraction. The miners, known as \\"pions\\", still used traditional methods, using wetted wooden stakes to break off blocks, and their unfinished work is still visible in some of the excavations around the moat.  The Hundred Years' War  The area around Loudun was the focus of attention in the Hundred Years' War. In January 1340, Edward III of England formally claimed the title of 'King of France'. In June, the English fleet decimated the French fleet at the mouth of the Zwin in what is now the Netherlands. The war had begun. It was initially fought in the north of France and the Netherlands, but it was Aquitaine that was at stake. After four generations of peace in the area, the castles and town walls were in a poor state of repair. In 1340 the castles at Ranton and Cur√ßay-sur-Dive were re-built; that of Ranton by Guillaume de Bois Gourmont and that at Cur√ßay by Huet Odart, both under instructions from Jean II; they were part of an elaborate network of fortresses that ensured that the area remained under French control. The castle at Ranton was only one of those rebuilt by Guillaume de Bois Gourmont: the largest was that at Bois Gourmont, near Veniers, just north of Loudun, of which only the ruined keep now remains. In 1345, Jeanne Gourmont, daughter of Guillaume de Bois Gourmont married Jean de la Jaille. The castle and estates of Ranton were part of Jeanne's dowry, and Jean de la Jaille became the Lord of Ranton. He was already an experienced and valued knight: he had been born in 1324 and brought up in a privileged environment in which the values of medieval chivalry dominated. He first appeared in the rolls of the King's army at the age of 16 when he is recorded as leading a troop of three young squires to join the army in Flanders. He first saw action at the head of a troop of twenty soldiers at the Battle of Saint-Omer on 24 June 1340 between an Anglo-Flemish army commanded by Robert III of Artois and the French under Eudes IV, Duke of Burgundy. In 1354, Louis I, Duke of Anjou was appointed as the Governor of Tourraine and Jean de la Jaille joined his service. In 1355, Jean was in the entourage of Jean de Clermont, Mar√©chal de France and Lieutenant General to the King in Touraine and Poitou, one of the most powerful and brilliant Barons in the Court of Jean le Bon. He was fortunate to escape with his life at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. Jean de la Jaille remained in the service of Louis I of Anjou, and was nominated Captain and Defender of Loudun in 1360, a function he fulfilled with honour and success for over 30 years. Poitiers itself was taken by the English in 1360, and was only recaptured by the French under Bertrand du Guesclin in 1370. During this period, Loudun and its network of fortresses was the frontier between the English and French controlled areas. There were periodic skirmishes between English and French forces, not to mention problems with lawless bands, discharged soldiers and booty seekers. Jean de la Jaille twice saved Loudun from occupation and pillage. In the late 1360s, the English captured the castle at Moncontour and controlled the valley of the Dive. Only the network of fortresses around Loudun held out. In 1369, John Chandos and Lord Pembroke combined forces and again besieged Loudun. They occupied the town, but Jean de la Jaille held out in the citadelle in the face of a torrent of fire. The countryside suffered terribly. The area north of Loudun, around Roiffe, was particularly badly affected. It was some decades before the villages were re-established, and the land brought back under cultivation. Many of the excavated rooms off the dry moat around the Chateau de Ranton date from this time. They served as a refuge for the villagers. Jeanne Gourmont died in 1373 and is buried in the Church of Saint-Croix in Loudun. The titles she brought to Jean de la Jaille on their marriage notably that of Lord of Ranton, passed to her eldest son, Tristan III de la Jaille. Both her two sons, now seasoned knights, fought the English in Poitou and in Brittany. Tristan III led a company in which his brother, Guichard was his lieutenant, and he was lieutenant to his father, the governor of Loudun. In 1371, he had married Eleanor de Maille, daughter of the Lord de Breze. He was part of the Court of Louis I of Anjou, and was killed with him at Bari in 1384, and the title of Lord of Ranton passed to his eldest son, Tristan IV In 1388, at the age of 14, Tristan IV left La Rochelle with other adventurous young squires to fight the Duke of Lancaster in Castille. In 1392 he joined the King at Le Mans and was one of the leading captains in the Angevin army. In 1409, he set out with Louis II of Anjou to unsuccessfully claim the Kingdom of Naples. His uncle, Guichard did not have lands to tie him to France, and as soon as war with the English calmed during the 1380s, he left to fight in Hungary. In 1395, Guichard went on a crusade against the Ottoman Turks who had captured Constantinople. He was with the army defeated at the siege of Nicopolis in 1396. It took two years, and a great deal of ransom money to bring the survivors home. In 1400, he left with a second expedition led by Marshal Boucicault de Genes to aid the Eastern Emperor, Manuel II. They sailed into the Golden Horn in 1400 with 1,400 men-at-arms just in time to save Galata from the Turks. They were besieged in Constantinople for two years. In a naval battle, Guichard de la Jaille was again noted in dispatches for his bravery and courage. He returned to France in 1405 and died the following year. Jean de la Jaille had also died in 1405, at the age of 81. By then, he was \\"deaf, senile and infirm\\" and was ruined financially. His estates had been too often mortgaged to pay for his and his son's military adventures. Tristan IV was made Grand Master of the Household of the King of Sicily. In 1425 he became Guard and Captain of the Ch√¢teau de Loudun. However, Tristan left again for Naples with King Louis in 1429. He participated in the victory of Aquila and was rewarded with the government of the region of Reggio. Louis never become effective King of Naples and died of malaria at Cosenza in 1434. The following year, his brother Ren√© of Anjou was named King of Naples. Tristan died in Reggio soon afterwards. Tristan IV had three sons: Robert, the eldest was killed at Agincourt in 1415. The two younger ones, Bertrand and Chretien, followed their father to Sicily in 1409; Chretien stayed there to become the Grand Senechal to the Court of Louis II, the King of Sicily. Bertrand took part in three years of campaigning, culminating in the victory of Roccasecca in 1411, then returned to look after the estates in France. He was Lord of la Grande Jaille, east of Loudun, of Ranton, of Avrille in Anjou; of Beuxes; of La Roche-Talbot in Souvigne-sur-Sarthe; of la Balayere in the Bierne; of La Varenne-Bouzeau near to Moranne and others. He grew up at Ranton and it remained his mother's home until her death. His childhood and youth at Ranton brought him into regular contact with his neighbours in the Ch√¢teau of Curcay. This was owned by the Odart family: a distinguished family, as famous as that of de la Jaille for their exploits in the crusades and against the English. In 1418, Bertrand married Guillemette, the daughter of Guillaume Odart. In addition to his inherited estates, Louis XII of France made Bertrand de la Jaille the squire of his household, Counsellor and then Chamberlain to the Crown. In 1429, Bertrand de la Jaille succeeded his father as the captain- governor of the city of Loudun. The same year, a Commission of Doctors of Theology recognised Joan of Arc's mission to crown Charles VII of France was divinely inspired. In April, after Joan's recognition of Charles in Chinon, and to relieve the siege of Orl√©ans, the King sent \\"Monseigneur de la Jaille\\" ahead of his forces. His second son, Pierre de la Jaille, born in 1419, was brought up as Page to the Arthur, Count of Richemont and was his Squire at the age of ten in 1429 when Arthur de Richemont came to the rescue of Joan of Arc. They were probably therefore involved in the most significant military action prior to Joan's arrival in late April outside Rouvray where a thousand French and Scottish soldiers attempted unsuccessfully to intercept and divert an English supply convoy in the Battle of the Herrings, so named because the convoy was carrying a large supply of fish for Lent. They also fought alongside Joan of Arc at the battle of Patay in 1429. When, in 1440, the English returned to the offensive and re-occupied the southern part of Maine, it was Bertrand de la Jaille that joined forces with those of the occupied areas and forced an English retreat. In 1441, at the siege of Saint- Denis-d'Anjou, he was amongst the knights that \\"charged so vigorously that the first wave killed more than 200 and forced the remaining English forces to retreat\\". After 1452, Bertrand passed most of his time at the Ch√¢teau de Roche-Talbot, his favourite residence in Souvign√©-sur-Sarte, but frequently visited Ranton and his other estates in the area. His wife had use of the Ch√¢teau de Ranton through the marriage settlement and lived there until her death. She is buried in the family vault in the Church of the Ropemakers in Loudun. Bertrand died in 1456 at la Roche-Talbot and is buried in the Chapelle de Saint Roche at Souvign√©-sur-Sarte. He had five children. The eldest, Philibert took over from his grandfather, Tristan IV, the title of Grand Master of the Household to the King of Sicily, but died before his father in 1456. Pierre de la Jaille gained a reputation as a diplomat and courtier, rather than as a man of arms. He was caught up in the violence and intrigues that grew out of the jealousy between Richemont and Georges, the Count de Tremoille. However, he helped arrange the Treaty of Arras in 1435, which cemented the peace between France and Burgundy leading to the eventual defeat of the English.  The Renaissance  The fourth son of Bertrand de la Jaille, Bertrand II, became Lord of Ranton and Avrille on the death of his father in 1456 and the remainder of the family estates on the death of Pierre in 1483 and Hardouin in 1493. Bertrand divided his time between the estates of Ranton, Beuxes and Avrille. He Married Catherine le Roy, daughter of Guillaume, Lord of Chavigny and Fran√ßoise of Fontenay. Louis XI appointed him as his \\"echanson aux gages\\" at a salary of 330 pounds a year in 1468, from when he was part of the Royal court at Montils-les-Tours, Amboise and other royal residences. In 1480, Ren√© of Anjou, nominal King of Naples and Sicily and titular King of Jerusalem, died. His death precipitated a new series of battles for succession in Italy. Bertrand II de la Jaille participated in the campaigns in Italy. He returned to France in 1496 and died the same year. Bertrand II had eight children: Ren√©, Gilles, Madelon, Pierre, Jeanne, Marguerite, Isabelle and Fran√ßoise. As was usual in those days, the eldest son, Rene, inherited the titles to all the major estates. At this time these were La Roche-Morier, La Grande Jaille, de Beuxes, Ranton, La Jaille-en-Chahaigne, La Varenne, La Roche-Talbot and Souvigne. Rene married Jeanne Herisson in 1494. Rene de la Jaille was several times in court, accused of various misdemeanors, and died in 1515. He died a month after the battle of Marignan, and it is likely that he died of wounds. Rene and Jeanne de la Jaille had two children; Rene II and Claude, but Rene I's death in 1515 left the estates in the care of his widow. Jeanne looked after them until her death in 1541. She remarried in 1518 with Gabriel de la Chatre, but her eldest son, Rene II, inherited the titles to the family estates. This was normal practice: the eldest son inherited all feudal titles from his father, the widow only being the regent for their management. Rene II de la Jaille married Magdelaine de Montgomery, the sister of Gabriel, Comte de Montgomery in 1530. They had a single daughter - Fran√ßoise de la Jaille. She married Gabriel d'Apchon - linking two of the great feudal families. He took part in the Italian campaign in 1539 and was made a Knight of the King's Order, a rare and distinguished honour. By the 1550s, Rene II was a Knight of the Order of St Michael, Senechal of Anjou, and a Gentleman of the court of Catherine de' Medici. In 1555, he was captain general of the rear-guard of the French forces. This had originally been an elite troupe, but was now little more than an undisciplined rabble of conscripts. In the campaign in Picardy against the Spanish, Rene was captured and ransomed for 20,000 ECU. This was a considerable sum and virtually ruined the family. He sold the estates in Anjou and most of those in the Loudun area: Ranton was one of the few estates he kept. He died two years later, still fighting - this time at the battle of St Quentin in 1557. The title to Ranton, Bois Gourmond and Preaux passed to his son-in-law, Gabriel d'Apchon, Lord of Roche-Talbot and numerous other properties in the Loire and Auvergne. He had 5 children: 2 sons - Charles and Jacques; and 3 daughters - Dianne, Gabrielle and Marguerite.  Ranton in the Wars of Religion  Charles d'Apchon inherited the castle and estates at Ranton in about 1580. He had married Fran√ßoise de Vendomois in 1576, but she died four years later. He married a second time in September 1581 with Louise de Ch√¢tillon d'Argenton. They had a daughter - Renee d'Apchon, and a son, Andre, born early in 1589. Charles was captain of a troop of about 50 men-at-arms, and was frequently in battles. In July 1589, he was killed in the assault of St Saturnin in the Auvergne. On his death, Louise, her daughter Renee and son Andre had their main residence at Roche- Talbot. She had considerable debts and great difficulties with managing her estates. In 1595, Louise married again - with Gilbert du Puy du Fou, also known as \\"de Commeronde\\", the second son of Rene du Puy du Fou. Andre took his mother's name of de Chastillon, and Louise retained the feudal rights to the estates of Ranton in her second marriage contract. Louise and Gilbert had a single daughter, Isalbelle. Gilbert died in 1609. Louise's first daughter, Renee died there in 1612, and Louise transferred the feudal rights for Roche- Talbot to her son-in-law, Jacques II de Beauvan du Rivau. She retained only Ranton, Bois Gourmont and Preaux, for which she re-swore allegiance to the King on 4 July 1613. Her second daughter, Isabelle du Puy du Fou, inherited Ranton from her mother, and exercised the rights of \\"high, middle and low justice\\" in the manor until 1628. She was married (to Charles de la Touche), but he died in 1624, she retired to a nunnery in 1628, and died in 1631. On the death of his step father, in 1625, Andre de Ch√¢tillon became Marquis d'Argenton, Lord of Moncontour, Bouville, La Jaille, Beuxes, Bois-Rouge and other estates. He became Lord of Ranton in 1628: His sister, Renee retired to her nunnery, and he married Marie Margerite Gouffier. In 1631, the Ch√¢teau de Ranton was bought by Paul Aubin, a friend of Richelieu and nephew of the duc de Sully. He also acquired various estates in the area: Bourneuf, La Jaille and others. Throughout this turbulent time, the estates at Ranton were enjoying a new prosperity, and the main buildings around the Cour d‚ÄôHonneur were re-modeled in the Louis XIII style. Paul Aubin died in 1644. His son, Henri, became Lord of Ranton and, like most of his predecessors, he followed a career in the army. By 1650, he was a major of a Regiment of Dragoons. His wife was no doubt left to look after his daughter and the estates, while he took part in the campaigns against the Huguenots. His Daughter, Marie Aubin, married Christofe Le Sesne de Menille, Lord of Menille and Veniers in 1665. Their eldest son, Louis-Charles, was born the following year. A daughter, Marie Scholastique, and a second son, Jean-Baptiste, were born soon afterwards. These were times of great misery in the area around Loudun. In 1675 to 1677, hail destroyed most of the harvest - both of grapes and wheat, the two staple crops of the area. The famine and poverty was so great that many died or left. Of the 3000 households in and around Loudun in 1670, only 1000 remained by 1677. Louis-Charles Le Sesne, Lord of Bourdin in his own right, married Eustache-Henriette de Buade in 1685. She was probably the daughter of Louis de Buade de Frontenac, who was a Protestant courtier and Governor General of New France (in Canada) from 1672 to 1682 and from 1689 to his death in 1698, so was in France at the time of the wedding. A first son was born in March the following year. He was baptised Charles-Henri Le Sesne de Menille de Themars on 15 March in the church of St Pierre in Loudun. Within weeks, his grandfather died and Louis-Charles swore allegiance for Ranton on 27 May 1686. Befitting his status, he took the title of Baron of Ranton. Charles-Henri had to wait 33 years until 1719 before he inherited the title, but he died four years later. He had no children, and the title passed to his younger brother, Jean Baptiste. Like many second sons at the time, the church offered the best chance of security, and Jean-Baptiste was already an established Janseniste priest. He combined this with his duties as Lord of Ranton, Pas de Jeu, Riveau, la Jaille and other estates until his death at Utrecht in 1775, but left no heir. The Ch√¢teau de Ranton and the estates that went with it were sold on 26 August 1776 to the Marquis Michel-Ange de Castellane, Brigadier in the King's army and his Ambassador Extraordinary. He had also bought the Ch√¢teau de Villandry in 1754. In 1783 the estate passed to his son Esprit-Fran√ßois-Henri de Castellane, Marshall to the King's Camp and Chevalier d'Honneur to Sophie, Princess of France, the youngest daughter of Louis XVI of France and his Queen consort, Marie Antoinette.  Ranton in the Revolution and 19th century  In the French Revolution, the Ch√¢teau de Ranton was abandoned only for a few years during the Terror and the estate passed to the Marshall's daughter on his death, in 1797. She died in 1824, and the Ch√¢teau de Ranton passed to her daughter, Madame d'Orme. In 1844, Madame d'Orme sold the Ch√¢teau de Ranton to the priest of Ranton: Abb√© Aubineau. He did much to preserve the Ch√¢teau and to rekindle interest in the shrine of \\"La bonne Dame de Ranton\\". This chapel, which dated from the 14th century, contained a small statue of the Virgin which had apparently been found by a wood-cutter at this spot. The legend was that he took it home, but it returned to its original place, three times. In the revolution, the chapel was sold as public property. It was bought by a magistrate, M. Havard, who donated it to the Diocese. It was re-built as a larger church in 1871 through the efforts of the Reverend Pere Briant, an architect and organiser of one of the first pilgrimages to Lourdes. The larger church gave a new impetus to pilgrimages to Ranton, which had been a regular feature of life in the Middle Ages. The chapel of the Ch√¢teau de Ranton, dedicated to St Leonard, was given to the village by Abb√© Aubineau to serve as the Parish church in 1862. The deed of gift was written into the Commune records on 25 January. In his will, he left the Ch√¢teau of Ranton to his great nephews. They sold it at auction in December 1889. The only bidder was the schoolmaster of the neighbouring village of Cur√ßay, Mr. Manson. By this time the Ch√¢teau was still habitable, but much of it was little more than a ruin. Like many similar properties throughout France, it fell to the local schoolmaster to preserve as well as he could the vestiges of the past. Mr. Manson is still remembered in the village as a severe and eccentric recluse. One of the main towers of the entrance collapsed in 1942 and on his death, in April that year, M. Manson left the estate to his housekeeper and his nephew.  Restorations  The ch√¢teau was bought in 1964 by Mr and Mrs Piechaud. He was a sculptor and undertook most of the substantial restoration and reconstruction of the walls and towers. He had great respect for the forms and styles of the various parts of the ch√¢teau, and the quality of the restoration work is remarkable. The Piechauds took on other restorations at the end of the 1960s and the Ch√¢teau de Ranton was sold in 1969 to Mr and Mrs Fonteneau, publishers in Poitiers. In 1972, the Ch√¢teau de Ranton was sold to an American couple from Arizona, Mr and Mrs Baker. Little was changed in the ch√¢teau during the 1970s and 1980s and parts of the land around it were abandoned, although the main structure was well maintained. Mr Baker died in 1986 and his wife died in 1988. The ch√¢teau and the surrounding land were acquired from the estate of the Baker family in October 1989 by the present owners, Peter and Paola Johnston, who have since renovated and restored it.

Design and development The C.I was a successful design, and it was used on Western and Eastern Fronts, Macedonia, Salonika and Palestine. Early production examples were armed only with a single Parabellum machine gun on a Schneider ring mounting, but later aircraft had additionally a synchronised Spandau gun on the port side of fuselage. When used as a light bomber the C.I could also carry 100 kg of bombs. In addition to the parent company, the Bayerische Rumpler-Werke, the Rumpler C.I was also produced by the Germania Flugzeug-Werke, the M√§rkische Flugzeug-Werke, the Hannoversche Waggonfabrik and the Albert Rinne Flugzeug-Werke. Variants included the C.Ia, which used a 180 hp Argus As.III engine instead of Mercedes D.III, the C.II, of which there's no evidence that any were actually built, 6B 1 single-seat floatplane fighter, and a Rumpler-built batch of C.Is intended for training which omitted the gun ring in the rear cockpit and was powered by a 150 hp Benz Bz.III. It was this training role in which the C.I was latterly used, its friendly handling qualities making it suitable to be flown even by inexperienced pilots.

Among the Sikhs, a Jathedar is an ordained leader of the clergy and leads a Takht, a sacred and authoritative seat. Sikh clergy consists of five Jathedars, one each from five takhts or sacred seats. The Jathedar of Akal Takht makes all the important decisions after consultations with the Jathedars of the other four Takhts. The highest seat of the Sikh nation is called Akal Takht. History During the 18th century, Jathedars of Takhts were appointed by the Sarbat Khalsa, a biannual deliberative assembly of Sikhs held at Amritsar in Panjab. From 1921, Jathedars of Takhts have been appointed by Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), an elected body of the Sikhs controlled by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), a political party in the state of Punjab and an ally of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In November 2015, the Sikhs appointed four interim Jathedars through the traditional Sarbat Khalsa at Chabba village on the outskirts of Amritsar, Panjab. Some 100,000 to 500,000 Sikhs attended the event from around the world. A few Sikh organizations did not attend and refused to recognize the resolutions of the event.

The community dates to 1889 when it was designed by American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr. (1822-1903) and developed by the Sudbrook Company. Known most for designing well-known urban projects like Central Park in New York City, Olmsted conceived this \\"suburban village\\" with curved roads and open green spaces, traits that set the community apart from its contemporaries. Two homes in the district were designed by architect George Archer in the Colonial Revival style. Sudbrook Park was registered on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and from 1993 to 1999 portions of Sudbrook Park became listed as Baltimore County Historic Districts. Today, the community continues to uphold Olmsted's vision through community association regulations. It is a tight-knit community and holds several annual events and neighborhood activities. One-lane bridge One of Sudbrook Park's unique features is the one-lane bridge that crosses over Western Maryland Railway. Constructed in 1889, the bridge stood for more than a century with a wooden platform. In 2005, the bridge closed for reconstruction. It reopened about a year later with an asphalt pavement, retaining its one-lane status in order to preserve the community's historic charm.

Bush and Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov, National Archaeological Museum, Sofia, June 2007 Bulgarian-American relations, first formally established in 1903, have moved from missionary activity and American support for Bulgarian independence in the late 19th century to the growth of trade and commerce in the early 20th century, to reluctant hostility during World War I and open war and bombardment in World War II, to ideological confrontation during the Cold War, to partnership with the United States in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and growing political, military and economic ties in the beginning of the 21st century. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 32% of Bulgarians approve of U.S. leadership, with 16% disapproving and 52% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup  From first contacts to 1919 = American missionaries and schools in Bulgaria  The first contact between Americans and Bulgarians in the early 19th century was through American books and American missionaries. The first American literature to be translated into Bulgarian was Benjamin Franklin's introduction to Poor Richard's Almanac, \\"The Way to Wealth\\", in 1837. In 1839 a Protestant religious society, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, sent the first Protestant missionaries to the Ottoman Empire, where the Ottoman Government had given them permission to preach to the Christian population. One of these missionaries, Elias Riggs, learned Bulgarian and published the first guide to Bulgarian grammar for foreigners in 1843. By the end of the 1850s, American missionaries had printed and distributed a version of the Bible in the Bulgarian vernacular. Charles Morse published a full textbook of Bulgarian grammar in 1860, and compiled the first Bulgarian-English dictionary. In 1860, the first American school (today called the American College of Sofia) was founded in Plovdiv by missionaries from the Congregational Church. Besides Bible instruction, it taught mathematics, chemistry, physics, and the English language. In 1863, a school for young women was opened in Stara Zagora. The two schools merged and moved to Samokov in 1869. The American School of Samokov offered an American-style education, taught in English to the Bulgarians. Robert College, a branch of the State University of New York, also played an important part in educating the new Bulgarian elite. It opened its campus in Istanbul in 1863, teaching mathematics, natural history, economics, logic, political history, international law, philosophy, and the English language. By 1868 half the student body were Bulgarians. Two future Prime Ministers of Bulgaria, Konstantin Stoilov, Todor Ivanchov studied there. American missionaries also founded the newspaper Zornitsa, which published for seventy-six years, with articles on science, history, and the theory and practice of western democracy. The model of the American Republic was frequently discussed by Bulgarian intelligentsia as one model for an independent Bulgaria. The Protestant missionaries had limited success in Bulgaria. Their work was opposed by the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and by many leaders of the Bulgarian national-liberation movement, who did not want to see Bulgaria divided by religion, but the schools and newspapers founded by the missionaries contributed to the Bulgarian National Awakening and the American missionaries who returned to the United States often became unofficial diplomats for Bulgaria.  American diplomats, journalists and Bulgarian independence  American Consul-General to Istanbul Eugene Schuyler American journalist Januarius MacGahan In April 1876 (May by the modern calendar), a group of Bulgarian nationalists led an uprising against Ottoman rule in the area in different parts of the country. (See April Uprising.) The uprising was badly planned, equipped and led, and failed. It was followed by savage reprisals and massacres carried out by Turkish regular and irregular soldiers. Bulgarian students at Robert College in Istanbul brought the stories of the massacres to the attention of Dr. Albert Long and the acting president of Robert College Dr. George Washburn, who wrote letters to the Istanbul correspondent of the London Daily News Edwin Pears. On June 23 Pears wrote the first article about the \\"Bulgarian Horrors\\". The article led to inquires in Parliament, and Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli called for a formal investigation. The American Consul General in Istanbul, Eugene Schuyler, traveled to the Bulgarian territories of the Ottoman Empire in July and August 1876 to investigate the reports of atrocities and massacres. He was joined by an American journalist Januarius MacGahan, on a commission for the London Daily News. MacGahan wrote a series of vivid articles about the massacres, particularly about what had happened in the Bulgarian village of Batak, where MacGahan reported that the entire village had been massacred. These reports, carried in the British and European press and later printed as pamphlets, caused widespread anger against the Ottoman Government. In November 1876, Consul General Schuyler and Prince Tseretelev published their full report, estimating that fifteen thousand Bulgarians had been killed in the aftermath of the uprising. (A report by British diplomat Walter Baring at the same time put the number at twelve thousand.) In addition to describing the reprisals and massacres, it contained the first map of the Bulgarian population in the region. The Russian Government demanded reforms by the Ottoman Government to protect the Bulgarians and other nationalities within the Ottoman Empire. When the Ottoman Government refused, the Russian Empire declared war on Turkey. In 1877, the Russian Army moved through Romania, crossed the Danube and defeated the Turkish Army, after costly battles at Pleven and Shipka Pass. (See the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) and History of Bulgaria.) The advance of the Russian Army was covered by MacGahan and other journalists for the British press. The American public, largely thanks to the reports of MacGahan and American missionaries in Bulgaria, was sympathetic to the Bulgarian cause. The Turkish Government accused Consul-General Schuyler of bias toward the Bulgarians and breach of diplomatic practice. He was withdrawn from Istanbul by the U.S. Government in May 1878. With their army defeated, The Ottoman Sultan was forced to sign the Treaty of San Stefano, which granted extensive territories to a newly independent Bulgaria. However, the British, German, and French governments refused to recognize the new Russian-sponsored state. In 1878, the Treaty of Berlin, drafted largely by German Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck and British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, drew a new map of Bulgaria which returned parts of eastern and southern Bulgaria as well as the whole geographical region of Macedonia to Turkey, gave the Dobrudzha (also Dobruja) region along the Danube to Romania. The Berlin treaty created the Principality of Bulgaria, nominally under Ottoman rule. Prince Alexander of Battenberg, nephew of King Alexander the Second, became the first Prince. The loss of lands which Bulgarians saw as part of their homeland was bitterly resented in Bulgaria. The re-uniting of these territories to Bulgaria became the major objective of Bulgarian foreign policy for the next sixty years.  American isolationism and tentative diplomacy  King Ferdinand of Bulgaria President Theodore Roosevelt America and Bulgaria had little diplomatic contact in the nineteenth century, but it did have commercial and cultural contact. Bulgaria had a modest participation in the 1893 Chicago Exposition. The Bulgarian writer Aleko Konstantinov visited the exposition and wrote a book, To Chicago and Back, in which he presented America as a technological leader and a land of opportunity. The book made a strong impression on the imagination of many Bulgarian intellectuals, and shaped their image of America. In 1887, the Russian Government, which suspected Prince Alexander of liberal tendencies, organized a coup in Bulgaria. Alexander went into exile, and the Bulgarian government chose a German prince, Ferdinand Saxe-Coburg- Gotha, as their new ruler. The United States made a tentative attempt to establish diplomatic relations with Bulgaria in 1901, but the diplomat named by Washington was rejected by the Bulgarian Government, since he was based in Istanbul rather than in the principality. Finally, on September 19, 1903, John B. Jackson, U.S. Special Envoy and Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece, Romania and Serbia, presented his diplomatic credentials and his accreditation letter from U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to Prince Ferdinand. At his Palace in Sofia, Prince Ferdinand gave a toast to President Roosevelt in English, and a band played American music, but the U.S. still did not fully recognize Bulgaria as an independent nation, since it was still by treaty a principality under Ottoman sovereignty. In 1908, when the Great Powers were distracted by the annexation of Bosnia by Austria-Hungary, Prince Ferdinand declared that Bulgaria was a fully independent state, and proclaimed himself King. Shortly afterward, President William Howard Taft offered full diplomatic recognition to Bulgaria. In 1912 and 1913, Bulgaria fought two wars to try regain territories it felt were rightfully Bulgarian from its neighbors. In the First Balkan War (1912), Bulgaria allied itself with Serbia, Greece and Montenegro, and successfully took Thrace and Macedonia from Turkey. However, in the Second Balkan War (1913) Bulgaria quarreled with its former allies and went to war, eventually fighting against Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, Ottoman Turkey and Romania. Bulgaria lost most of Thrace to Greece and Turkey; the city of Silistra and province of Southern Dobrudzha to Romania, and most of Macedonia to Serbia. During both wars, the United States remained neutral. Bulgaria and the United States in the First World War President Woodrow Wilson Charles Vopicka, State Department officer for Bulgarian affairs When World War I began in August 1914, both Bulgaria and the United States were neutral. The United States wished to stay out of any European conflict, while Bulgaria wanted to see which side, the Entente or the Central Powers, would help it regain Thrace, Dobrudzha, and Macedonia. On December 22, 1914, Stefan Panaretov, a former professor from Robert College in Istanbul, presented his credentials to President Wilson in Washington, and became the first Bulgarian Ambassador to the United States.\\"Reception of the First Minister of Bulgaria to the US\\" in United States Department of State / Papers relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States with the Address of the President to Congress, December 8, 1914 (1914) via http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/FRUS A few months later, in 1915, Dominick Murphy became the Consul-General in Sofia, the first American diplomat resident in Bulgaria. U.S. diplomat Charles Vopicka, covering Bulgaria for the State Department, wrote to Secretary of State Lansing in November 1914: \\"In my opinion Bulgaria is trying to through her diplomacy what she lost on the battlefield last year.... Bulgaria is trying to get Macedonia from Serbia, Kavala from Greece, and Silistra from Romania without war. Neither of the belligerent parties here is willing to promise this territory to her, but the other Balkan States - Serbia, Greece and Romania - are opposed to giving anything to Bulgaria... it is also possible that if the chances of war favor Germany and Austria, Bulgaria will join them, against the will of her people whose sympathies are with Russia, because the present Bulgarian Government believes that it can obtain more from Germany and Austria than from Russia\\". When British forces came close to capturing the Dardanelles and Istanbul in the spring of 1915, Bulgaria considered joining the Entente, but Britain, France and Russia were not willing to take territory away from their allies, Romania, Serbia and Greece. On the other hand, Germany promised to give Bulgaria the original borders it had had after the Treaty of San Stefano. Bulgaria signed an alliance with Germany on September 6, 1915, mobilized its forces, and declared war on Serbia on October 14. Britain, France and Italy, allies of Serbia, responded by declaring war on Bulgaria. In October 1915 the State Department sent Lewis Einstein, a diplomat from the American Embassy in Istanbul, to Sofia. He met Prime Minister Radoslavov, who told him that Bulgaria wanted to preserve friendly relations with the United States, and had joined the war reluctantly. He confirmed to Einstein that Bulgaria's goal was to retain the territory lost in 1913 from the Treaty of Bucharest. The Bulgarian Army, the largest in the Balkans, was victorious at first, occupying Skopje and most of the Serbian portion of Macedonia, entering Greek Macedonia, and taking Dobrudzha from the Romanians in September 1916. On April 6, 1917, Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare finally compelled the United States to declare war on Germany. The U.S. did not, however, declare war against Bulgaria or Germany's other allies, since Bulgaria did not have submarines and did not directly threaten American interests. The Bulgarian Prime Minister, Radoslavov, summoned U.S. Consul Dominick Murphy and assured him that Bulgaria was anxious to maintain good relations with the United States. Bulgaria and the U.S. were put into the position of being members of different alliances at war with each other, while keeping diplomatic relations. President Woodrow Wilson came under pressure from some members of Congress, particularly Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and from former President Theodore Roosevelt, who demanded a declaration of war on Bulgaria and Germany's other allies. The New York Times accused Bulgaria of joining forces with the 'devil' and providing information to Germany. President Wilson drafted a statement to Congress in December 1917 which said \\"I... recommend that Congress immediately declare the United States in a state of war with Austria-Hungary, with Turkey and with Bulgaria\\". The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and American philanthropist Cleveland Dodge, head of the board of Robert College, wrote to Wilson asking him not to declare war on Bulgaria, saying that it would have no effect on the war, but would harm the work of American missionaries, educational institutions, and American citizens in Bulgaria and Turkey. Wilson agreed to reconsider his proposal. In his final message to Congress delivered on December 4, Wilson called for a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, but said, \\"The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They too, are tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand in the direct path of our proposed actions. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but it seems to me that we should go only where immediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others\\". After holding hearings on the subject, Congress accepted Wilson's argument and declared war on Austria-Hungary, but not on Bulgaria or Turkey. In Point Eleven of his Fourteen Points, given by Wilson to Congress on January 8, 1918, Wilson called for \\"the relations of the several Balkan states to one another determined by a friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality.\\" In February 1918 he added four more principles, one of which said \\"Every territorial settlement involved in this war must be made in the interest and for the benefit of the population concerned.\\" Bulgarians saw in these declarations the hope that the United States would look favorably on its hopes for the return of its territories. Events in Bulgaria were strongly influenced by the Russian Revolution of February 1917, which stirred anti-monarchist and anti-war sentiment. In September 1918, there was a mutiny in the Bulgarian army, the so-called Vladaisko uprising and the combined forces of the Serbs, British, French and Greeks broke through Bulgarian lines on the Salonika front. Despite opposition from King Ferdinand, The Bulgarian Government of Prime Minister Malinov approached American diplomats about a possible withdrawal from the War, accepting the principals laid by President Wilson. From Sofia, Consul Murphy cabled to Washington, \\"Bulgaria accepts with good will the proposal that the President should be the arbiter of the Balkans.\\"Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1918, Supp. 1, Part one, 326-327. However, before the United States could take part in the negotiations, the Malinov government fell and was replaced by a government led by Agrarian Party leader Alexander Stambolyski. Stambolyski forced King Ferdinand to abdicate in favor of his son, Boris III, and signed an armistice with the Entente Powers. The interwar period (1919‚Äì1941)=The Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles Left to Right, Prime Minister David Lloyd George of the United Kingdom, Vittorio Orlando of Italy, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau of France, and President Woodrow Wilson When negotiations for the future of Europe began in Paris in 1919, Bulgaria found itself among the defeated countries. Nonetheless, the Bulgarian government felt that Wilson and the United States would look favorably upon its territorial claims. Wilson appointed a Commission of Inquiry to study the possible future map of the Balkans. The Commission concluded: \\"(1) that the area of annexed by Romania in the Dorbrudja is almost surely Bulgarian in character and should be returned; (2) that the boundary between Bulgaria Turkey should be restored to the Enos-Midia line as agreed upon at the conference in London; (3) that the south border of Bulgaria should be the coast of the Aegean Sea from Enos to the Gulf of Orfano, and should leave the mouth of the Struma River in Bulgarian territory; (4) that the best access to the sea for Serbia is through Saloniki; (5) that the final disposition of Macedonia cannot be determined without further inquiry; (6) that an independent Albania is almost certainly an indesirable political entity. We are strongly of the opinion that in the last analysis economic considerations will outweigh nationalistic affiliations in the Balkans and that a settlement which insures economic prosperity is most likely to be a lasting one.\\"Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States (PRFR) 1919, The Paris Peace Conference, vol. 11914, Washington, 1915 Bulgaria's territorial claims were strongly resisted by Romania, Greece, Turkey, and particularly Serbia. By the time the final peace treaty between the Allies and Bulgaria was negotiated, President Wilson had returned to the United States, where he faced bitter opposition to his proposed League of Nations within the U.S. Senate. On its proposals for restoring to Bulgaria the territory of southern Dobrudzha, largely inhabited by Bulgarians but given to Romania in 1913, and lands in Eastern Thrace along the Aegean Sea. The U.S. delegation faced the united opposition of France, Britain, Japan and Italy. The final treaty between the Allies and Bulgaria gave Greece formerly Bulgarian territories along the Aegean Sea in Thrace, with the promise that Bulgaria would have free access to the Aegean through Salonika, and through the Turkish Straits, which were to be administered by a newly created international state. Macedonia became part of the new state of Yugoslavia. In the midst of his defense of the Versailles Treaty, President Wilson suffered a stroke. Wilson was unwilling compromise with the Senate, and The Treaty was defeated in the Senate. In March 1921 Warren G. Harding became President, and the United States retreated into a policy of isolationism from European and Balkan affairs. The Treaty of Versailles reduced the territory of Bulgaria, but did not resolve any of the territorial conflicts in the Balkans. It created a powerful new state, Yugoslavia, next to Bulgaria, which claimed the Macedonian territories which Bulgaria felt belonged to it. It resulted in a flood of Bulgarian refugees out of the Yugoslavian part of Macedonia, Thrace, and of Greek refugees out of Bulgaria, and created tensions which would help lead to Bulgaria and the United States being on opposite sides in the Second World War. Bulgarian-American relations between the Wars King Boris III The period between 1919 and 1939 was extremely difficult for Bulgaria and the rest of Europe. It saw large dislocations of populations, economic depression, and the rise of extremist parties on the left and right. Bulgaria was first led by Prime Minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski and his Agrarian Party. Stamboliyski's socialist reforms were resisted by Tsar Boris, and his policy of reconciliation with Yugoslavia was bitterly opposed by a nationalist political movement, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO), started by Bulgarians from the region of Macedonia, after the war part of Yugoslavia, which demanded that Bulgaria reclaim Macedonia from Yugoslavia by force. When Stamboliyski officially recognized the border with Yugoslavia and banned the VMRO in 1923, he was deposed in a violent coup and beheaded. The Communist Party was suppressed, and Communist Party leader Georgi Dimitrov fled through Yugoslavia to Austria. Virtual civil war followed. The Communist Party or its allies made two attempts to kill King Boris, including a bombing of St. Nedelya Cathedral in 1925 which resulted in the death of 123 people. However, the Agrarian Party remained popular, and won the 1931 elections. As the effects of the worldwide repression reached Bulgaria, social division deepened, The Agrarian government was overthrown by a coup, backed by King Boris, in 1934. In 1935, King Boris banned all opposition parties, and took Bulgaria into an alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The signing of the Balkan Pact in 1938 with Greece and Yugoslavia gave Bulgaria more normal relations with its neighbors, but Bulgaria maintained its territorial claims to Yugoslav-held Macedonia, Greek-held Eastern Thrace and Romanian held Dobrudzha. (See History of Bulgaria.) Pursuing its policy of isolationism, the United States played little role in the political events of the Balkans, but it did move toward more constructing more normal diplomatic relations with the changing Bulgarian governments. A series of treaties were signed and ratified between the two countries, including agreements for postal services, conciliation, arbitration, naturalization, and extradition.  The growth of Bulgarian-American commerce  During the 1920s, Bulgaria experienced an economic boom, and trade with the United States began to increase. American firms built grain elevators, dockyards, and dock facilities at the port of Varna. In 1928 Bulgaria was the largest exporter of attar of roses (used to make perfume) to the United States, and also a major exporter of tobacco to the U.S.New York Times, February 3, 1929 In 1922 the Bulgarian Finance Ministry made an agreement with the American Banknote Company to print a large quantity of Bulgarian currency in the United States. There was even the beginning of a thriving copyright infringement of American movies in Bulgaria. On May 3, 1925, the New York Times reported: \\"Picture pirates keep American moving pictures agents on the jump in the Balkans. There are no copyright laws and treaty provisions which protect American films in Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria, and consequently those countries are the happy hunting ground for film thieves. A film stolen in transit is copied and the copies sold to the Balkan countries.\\" In 1928 Americans provided humanitarian assistance following a major earthquake in southern Bulgaria. American Foundations were also active in Bulgaria. The Rockefeller Foundation supported educational institutions in Bulgaria, constructed a building for the Faculty of Agronomy at the University of Sofia. The Rockefeller Foundation spent about three hundred thousand dollars in Bulgaria, sending thirty doctors to study in the United States, sharing the cost of establishing a National Health Institute, and carrying out a major campaign to eradicate malaria.New York Times, April 21, 1935. In 1925 there were only 125 trained nurses in Bulgaria. The American Red Cross organized a school of nursing to train new medical personnel. The Near East Foundation, founded in 1930 with the assets of the Near East Relief organization, built fourteen playgrounds in Sofia and thirty-four around the country. American schools also continued to play an important role. In 1935 the American College in Sofia had 254 men students and 237 women students from all over Bulgaria, providing an American-style secondary education, complete with athletics, an orchestra and chorus, student council, and yearbook. Second World War President Franklin Roosevelt U.S. B-24 over Ploie»ôti, Romania in August 1943. Several B-24s were shot down on their return flight by Bulgarian fighters King Boris and Adolf Hitler, 1943 When World War II began in September 1939, both Bulgaria and the United States were neutral. As in World War I, Bulgaria looked for an ally that would help it regain lands it claimed in Yugoslavia, Romania and Greece. In September 1940, Bulgaria succeeded in negotiating, with the help of Germany, the return of Southern Dobruzha from Romania.  Bulgaria's involvement on the Axis' side  In March 1941, the German Army asked permission to move its troops through Bulgaria to attack Greece, which was successfully resisting an invasion by Germany's ally, Italy. King Boris granted the German request, and on March 1, 1941, Bulgaria permitted the Germans to pass through its territory and joined the Axis powers. Bulgaria was passive while the combined forces of Germany, Italy and Hungary invaded and defeated Yugoslavia and Greece. Then in April 1941, Bulgarian forces occupied the territories of present-day Macedonia, and the Greek parts of Macedonia and Thrace up to the Aegean Coast, including the islands of Thasos and Samothrace. Bulgaria did not participate in the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, and did not break diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In December 1941, after Germany declared war on the United States, Bulgaria followed the German lead. On December 13, 1941, Bulgaria broke diplomatic relations and declared war on the United States. The United States did not immediately declare war on Bulgaria, however. Only in June 1942, did President Roosevelt call for a declaration of War. On June 2, 1942, President Roosevelt sent the following message to Congress: :To the Congress: :The Governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania have declared war against the United States. I realize that the three Governments took this action not upon their own initiative or in response to the wishes of their own peoples but as the instruments of Hitler. These three Governments are now engaged in military activities directed against the United Nations and are planning an extension of these activities. :Therefore, I recommend that the Congress recognize a state of war between the United States and Bulgaria, between the United States and Hungary, and between the United States and Romania .\\"Messages of the Presidents. [www.presidency.ucsb.edu American Presidency Project] In Spring 1943, the Bulgarian government ordered the deportation of the Jewish population of Bulgaria. The deportation of Jews from Bulgarian territory was resisted and eventually blocked by protests by the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and members of parliament. The Jews of territories occupied by Bulgarian forces in Greece and Macedonia, however, were rounded up by Bulgarian troops and sent to Nazi death camps. (See History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia.)  Combat during WWII  The first combat between American and Bulgarian military forces took place during the American raid on the Romanian oil refinery complex of Ploie»ôti in 1943. On August 1, 1943, One hundred and seventy-seven B-24 Liberators with 1,726 crew members took off from Libya with the destination of the Ploie»ôti refinery complex in Romania, which was reported to be producing sixty percent of the gasoline and petroleum products used by the German war effort. The bombers flew over Greece and Bulgaria on their way to the target. Because of the distance - a thousand miles - they had no fighter escort. Because of clouds over Bulgaria, many of the planes became scattered. German radar detected the incoming aircraft, and the anti-aircraft defenses were warned when the bombers arrived for their low- level attack. The raid caused serious damage to the refinery complex, but losses were very high - fifty-four aircraft and 532 crew members were lost. During the return flight, several aircraft crashed in Bulgaria. One aircraft was intercepted and shot down by four Bulgarian fighters, crashing in a field near the village of Suhozem in Plovdiv Province. One crewmen died, as did seven villagers working in the field. (See Operation Tidal Wave.) A few months later, Bulgaria itself became a target. Between November 14, 1943 and January 10, 1944, The United States Army Air Force bombed Sofia six times. (The daylight raid on January 10, 1944 was also followed by a British nighttime bombing.) The raids killed an estimated 1,374 people, and damaged many downtown buildings. The National Library was destroyed and the National Theater and Museum of Natural History and other important buildings downtown were badly damaged. Thousands of civilians were evacuated to the countryside. (See Bombing of Sofia in World War II.) Many American planes were lost in the raids, some shot down by Bulgarian pilots. Between 1943 and 1944, 329 Allied pilots and air crew from seven nations, mostly American, were captured and confined in a prisoner-of-war camp located within the boundaries of what is today the Shumensko Plateau Natural Park, near the city of Shumen. They were released on September 8, 1944.  Political situation in Bulgaria after the formal start of the war  The raids shocked the Bulgarian public and government, which had expected to escape the direct impact of the war. Soon afterwards, Bulgaria engaged in informal diplomatic contacts with the United States. including negotiations in Cairo, to bring about Bulgaria's withdrawal from the Axis. The Communists, Agrarian Party and their allies, along with some army officers, had begun to organize a resistance, the Fatherland Front, against the Germans and Bulgarian Government in 1943. King Boris died suddenly in August 1943, after visiting Adolf Hitler in Germany. He was replaced by his six-year-old son, Simeon II, under a regents, among them the King's uncle, Prince Kirill. As the Red Army approached the northern border of Bulgaria in September 1944, the Bulgarian government announced that it was withdrawing unilaterally from the Axis, withdrew its troops from Greece and Yugoslavia, and then declared war on Germany, hoping to avoid a Soviet occupation. The Red Army continued to advance, however, crossing the Danube in September and entering Sofia on September 16, 1944. The Fatherland Front staged a coup d'√©tat and the Communists became part of the new government. The Armistice between Bulgaria and the Allies Big Three\\" at the Yalta Conference, Winston Churchill, Franklin Delano. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin. On October 28, in Moscow, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stainov signed an Armistice with representatives of the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union. Lieutenant General James Gammell, representative of the Supreme Allied Commander for the Mediterranean, and George Kennan, the U.S. Charge D'Affaires in Moscow, signed for the United States. Under the Armistice, Bulgaria promised to put its armed forces under Allied Command until Germany was defeated, and then to submit to an Allied Control Commission. Bulgaria was also obliged to withdraw its soldiers and government officials from the parts of Greece and Yugoslavia which had been occupied by its forces, to move out Bulgarians who had been settled on these territories after January 1941, and to repeal the laws by which these territories had been annexed to Bulgaria. By the time that Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt met in Yalta in March 1945, Bulgaria was occupied by the Soviet Army, and a pro-Soviet government had been installed. Bulgaria was discussed only once at Yalta Conference, when British Foreign Secretary Eden said that Soviet-occupied Bulgaria should not be allowed to form an alliance with Yugoslavia, where Marshal Tito was establishing a Communist regime. According to the Minutes of the Conference: \\"There was an exchange of views between the Foreign Secretaries on the question of the desirability of a Yugoslav-Bulgarian pact of alliance. The question at issue was whether a state still under an armistice regime could be allowed to enter into a treaty with another state. Mr. Eden suggested that the Bulgarian and Yugoslav Governments should be informed that this could not be approved. Mr. Stettinius suggested that the British and American Ambassadors should discuss the matter further with Mr. Molotov in Moscow. Mr. Molotov agreed with the proposal of Mr. Stettinius.\\" The Cold War (1947‚Äì1989)= The beginning of the Cold War in Bulgaria  Though the Communist Party formally was only one partner in the new coalition government, they, along with the Soviet representatives, were the real power in Bulgaria. They created a People's Militia to harass the opposition parties and gradually purged their rivals. In February 1945 the Regent, Prince Kirill, was arrested, along with dozens of ministers and officials of the old regime, tried for war crimes, and executed. Following the German surrender in May 1945, an Allied Control Commission was established in Sofia. Maynard Barnes, the U.S. representative in Sofia, attempted to persuade the government to follow democratic principles, but he had little success. In September 1946, the monarchy was officially abolished through a plebiscite, and King Simeon II was exiled. A Communist Government under President Vasil Kolarov and Georgi Dimitrov took power. The leader of the Agrarian Party, Nikola Petkov, who refused to cooperate with the Communists, was arrested and executed. By the end of 1947, Bulgaria was firmly in Soviet orbit.  The United States breaks diplomatic relations  President Harry Truman When the State Department appointed Donald Heath as U.S. representative to Bulgaria in September 1947, he found the Dimitrov government, following the Stalinist line, was increasingly hostile to the United States and the West. The announcement by President Harry S. Truman in 1947 of the Truman Doctrine, under which the United States supported the Greek Government against Communist rebels supported by Yugoslav dictator Josip Broz Tito, further increased tensions in the region. Georgi Dimitrov died in July 1949, and the following year was replaced by another Stalinist, Valko Chervenkov. At the same time, however, a momentous split was growing between Stalin and Tito in Yugoslavia, who wanted to pursue his own kind of communism. When Tito was expelled from the Cominform by Stalin, The Bulgarian Government remained loyal to Stalin. A purge was launched against suspected \\"Titoists\\" in the Bulgarian Government, leading to removal of between 60,000 and 70,000 Communist Party members, and to the arrest, trial and execution in December 1949 of Deputy Prime Minister Traicho Kostov.New York Times, February 23, 1950, pg. 2 During Kostov's trial for treason, American Minister Heath was frequently mentioned as a contact of Kostov. He was blamed for Kostov's alleged plot to overthrow the Bulgarian government, and for using the American Legation as a center of espionage. The United States responded to these charges by breaking diplomatic relations with Bulgaria on February 22. Heath and the forty-three members of the U.S. legation boarded the Orient Express on February 23 and left for Turkey. The Bulgarian Government denounced the break in relations as a new stage in \\"the fight of the American imperialists against the front of peace and democracy.\\"New York Times, February 23, 1950 Thereafter the Polish Embassy in Washington looked after Bulgarian interests in the United States, and the Swiss Embassy in Sofia protected American interests in Bulgaria. In the months that followed, Communist Party leader Chervenkov continued to follow the Stalinist model, rushing industrial development and collectivizing agriculture. The Orthodox Patriarch was sent to a monastery, and the church was put under state control. An estimated twelve thousand people were sent to labor camps between the end of World War Two and the death of Stalin in 1953. (See History of Communist Bulgaria.)  The United States and the regime of Todor Zhivkov  After the death of Stalin in 1953, the Bulgarian Communist Party began looking for a new leader to replace the rigid Chervenkov. In March 1954 it found a forty-one-year-old politburo member, Todor Zhivkov, who had commanded the People's Militia in Sofia at the end of World War II. Zhivkov remained Party Secretary for thirty-three years, one of the longest rule of any Soviet-bloc leader. Zhivkov modified some Stalinist policies, officially \\"regretting\\" the trial and execution of Kostov and other alleged \\"Titoists,\\" and closing some labor camps, but the regime continued to harshly repress any signs of dissent. Bulgaria did not experience anti-communist uprisings of the kind that rocked Berlin and Hungary in 1956 or Prague in 1968. Zhivkov maintained a strict and repressive Soviet-style regime at home, but he also tried, following the lead of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, to build better relations with the United States. In 1957, he gave an interview to New York Times correspondent Harrison Salisbury, his first interview to an American journalist, calling for immediate resumption of diplomatic relations with the United States.New York Times, September 22, 1957, pg. 1 He also called for more trade, and educational and cultural exchanges. Missions were reopened in the two countries in 1959. In September 1960, Zhivkov visited the United States to speak, along with dozens of other world leaders, at the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Zhivkov spent nearly a month in the United States. He visited food processing plants, and also visited Atlantic City, where he was impressed by the giant resort hotels. He told reporters that Bulgaria was considering the construction of one or two hotels of eight to ten stories on the Black Sea coast, similar to those he had seen in Atlantic City.New York Times, October 13, 1960, pg. 73. In his interviews with American reporters, Zhivkov denied that Bulgaria was a puppet state of the Soviet Union. \\"Puppet? Not true!\\" Zhivkov said to Edwin Gritz of the Washington Post \\"A great slander. The Soviet Union is helping us to build an independent economy.\\"Washington Post, October 8, 1960, page A11. In late November 1966, the U.S. and Bulgaria raised the level of their diplomatic missions from legations to Embassies, with an exchange of Ambassadors. Economic, technical, scientific and cultural contacts slowly were resumed. Radio Voice of America logo Despite his new diplomacy, Zhivkov allowed no dissent or free speech in Bulgaria. Bulgarian-language broadcasts of the Voice of America were jammed. An American diplomat was arrested for passing out American literature in the town of Plovdiv in 1960, and any contact with Americans was dangerous for ordinary Bulgarians. Zhivkov cultivated personal relationships with Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev (whom he took hunting in his hunting preserve near Razgrad), and maintained extremely close relations with the Soviet Union. In 1957, about one thousand Bulgarian students a year were studying in Soviet universities, and an additional ten thousand young Bulgarians a year went to the Soviet Union to work.New York Times, September 27, 1957 Bulgaria became a member of the Warsaw Pact on May 14, 1955. Though no Soviet troops were stationed on Bulgarian soil, in 1968, Zhivkov sent a Bulgarian division to join Polish, Hungarian and Soviet troops to crush a popular uprising in Prague. In 1978, the Bulgarian secret police were implicated in the assassination in London of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident who was a correspondent for the BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle radio and the U.S. sponsored Radio Free Europe. Markov was assassinated with a poisoned umbrella on September 7, Zhivkov's birthday. Democracy and partnership after 1989 The rise of democratic movements across Eastern Europe in the 1980s, the arrival in power in Moscow of Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, led to the downfall of Todor Zhivkov, who resigned as Communist Party leader on November 10, 1989. US Agency for International Development in BulgariaHe was succeeded by a new generation of leaders, who turned Bulgaria toward democracy and a market economy. Opposition parties and independent media began to spring up in Sofia, and the new leaders began to re-orient Bulgaria toward Western Europe and the United States. American University in Bulgaria (In Blagoevgrad) The U.S. Congress responded to the changes in Bulgaria and Eastern Europe by passing the Support for East European Democracies (SEED) Act in 1989, designed to help Central and East European countries to build democratic institutions. U.S. Government foreign assistance to Bulgaria totaled over $600 million through 2007. The American University in Bulgaria was founded in 1991, with assistance from the United States Government, to provide a liberal arts education to students from Bulgaria and other Balkan countries. Peace Corps Volunteers began to arrive in Bulgaria to teach English and aid in community development, and a Fulbright Program Commission was created to establish university exchanges. The Bulgarian elections of June 1990 and October 1991 brought a new government into power that favored closer relations with NATO, the EU, and the United States. Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev visited the United States and had talks with U.S. President George H. W. Bush in 1990, followed by the official visit to Sofia by U.S. Vice-President Dan Quayle. In 1999, President Bill Clinton became the first sitting U.S. President to visit Bulgaria, speaking to a huge crowd in Nevsky Square. To show their commitment to closer relations with the United States and earnest desire to become a member of NATO and the European Union, Bulgaria contributed a contingent of troops to the US led NATO peace keeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, beginning in 1996 and throughout that mission, which ended in 2004, followed by continued participation in the European Union Force (EUFOR) ready reaction force stationed at the former NATO Camp Butmir, in Sarajevo, Bosnia- Herzegovina.  Bulgaria and America during the Kosovo crisis  During the Kosovo crisis in 1999, when NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia, the center-right government in Bulgaria took the side of NATO. During the aerial bombardment, four NATO missiles accidentally landed in Bulgaria. On April 29, 1999, a NATO anti-radar missile missed its target in Yugoslavia and hit a house in Gorna Banja, a suburb of Sofia, thirty miles away. The pro-western cabinet favored opening Bulgaria's airspace to NATO, while the Socialist opposition resisted and organized protest marches. In a poll, 70% were against the war and this number increased to over 80% by the end of the conflict. The BBC reported on May 1, 1999 that \\"the Bulgarian public is divided between a desire to join NATO and the European Union and sympathy for fellow Slavs and Christian Orthodox Serbs.\\" NATO member flags in Sofia, Bulgaria Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova told a NATO conference that it was impossible to be neutral over Kosovo; she said one was either in favor or against the Yugoslav policy of intolerance. She also repeated Bulgaria's policy that Balkan borders should remain unchanged. She stated, \\"we want no more Balkanization of the Balkans.\\"BBC, May 13, 1999 While the Bulgarian government supported NATO, it refused to take large numbers of Kosovo refugees. According to the UNHCR, about 2500 Kosovars crossed into Bulgaria. Much larger numbers entered Macedonia and Albania. Pro-NATO and European sentiment prevailed. The Bulgarian Government also began to process of applying for NATO membership, and membership in the European Union, with the support of the United States.  Bulgaria and the United States after 9/11  Following the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, the Bulgarian government contributed troops to the NATO contingent in Afghanistan which overthrew the Taliban. The Bulgarian Armed Forces continued to provide a contingent of Soldiers (a reinforced company) to the International Stability Armed Forces (ISAF) under NATO command in Afghanistan through December 2014. Starting in September 2001 and concluding in November 2005, the United States Department of Defense, in cooperation with the Department of State and US Ambassador, Jim Pardew, began advising the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense in defense reform in order to assist, train, and prepare the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces for full membership in NATO. This Defense Cooperation initiative, the Joint Force Modernization Program, had the support of both countries' governments. In July 2003, after the United States and its allies invaded Iraq, Bulgaria deployed about four hundred soldiers to the 9,200 member multi-national force under Polish command. The Bulgarian battalion provided logistical support and did guard duty in southern Iraq. The Bulgarian contingent suffered thirteen soldiers and six civilians killed, before it was withdrawn by the Socialist-led coalition government in December 2005. Hungary and Ukraine pulled out soldiers at the same time. However, in 2006, the Bulgarian Parliament voted 151 to 15 to send 120 soldiers and 34 support staff to guard the Ashraf refugee camp north of Baghdad. US Secretary of State Rice and Bulgarian Foreign Affairs Minister Kalfin sign the Defense Cooperation Agreement in December, 2005 In March 2004, Bulgaria formally became a member of NATO. In December 2005, U.S. Secretary of State Rice and Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kalfin signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement which permitted U.S. military forces to establish Bulgarian-American Joint Military Facilities, whereby American soldiers could train at three Bulgarian military bases.

Bush visited Sofia to meet with Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov, to discuss greater military and political cooperation. President Bush praised Bulgaria for its democratic government and ethnic tolerance, which he said could serve as a model for other countries in the Balkans. In 2007 U.S. Ambassador John Beyrle toured several cities in the United States with Bulgarian Ambassador to the United States Elena Poptodorova, to encourage more American investment in Bulgaria. He also encouraged the Bulgarian Government step up its fight against corruption and organized crime. Bulgaria continues to participate actively in military missions and to have a close security partnership with the U.S., NATO and the European Union. As of October 2007, Bulgaria had 380 soldiers taking part in the NATO Mission in Afghanistan; 152 soldiers serving with the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq; 35 to 40 soldiers serving on a NATO mission in Kosovo; and about one hundred soldiers on an EU- led mission in Bosnia.Source: U.S. Embassy in Sofia The U.S. Summer Work- Travel Program is another important part of the relationship between the two countries.

Prelude The 300-km-long Meridian Ridge (Ziwuling), covered with dense forest, was a strategically important position in Guanzhong because it was a natural barrier in the southwest for the communist base in northwest China. To the east, it overlooked the Yulin ‚Äì Xianyang Highway, and to the west, it overlooked the Xi'an ‚Äì Lanzhou Highway, along which Xi'an could be reached within two days. The region was a dagger in the belly of the nationalist domain to the north of the Wei River and it had been a communist base since the late 1920s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the communist 385th Division led by commander Wang Hongshen was stationed in this region, and was surrounded by nationalist forces several times its strength. Clashes between the two sides were inevitable and after World War II such clashes finally developed into full-scale battle in the Chinese Civil War. In August 1947 nationalists deployed two divisions totaling six brigades to launch an encirclement and eradication campaign against the communists in their base at the Meridian Ridge. The communist local forces including the 1st and the 3rd Garrison brigades, and the headquarters of the communist 4th Column of communist regular field army with its lightly armed 6th Cavalry Division disengaged the pursuing nationalists by retreating separately northward, and then returned to Guanzhong region once more by reaching the region surrounding the Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town in heart of the Meridian Ridge (Zi Wu Ling, Â≠êÂçàÂ≤≠). Order of battle Nationalist (eight regiments totaling 6,000): *Reorganized 82nd Division commanded by General Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) **Reorganized 100th Brigade commanded by General Tan Chengxiang (Ë∞≠ÂëàÁ••) **Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade commanded by General Ma Buluan (È©¨Ê≠•ÈäÆ) **Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment (Brigade strength) commanded by General Ma Bukang (È©¨Ê≠•Â∫∑) Communist (three regiments and a cavalry division totaling 9,500): *2nd Regiment of the 1st Garrison Brigade commanded by Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞), who was also in charge of overall command *3rd Regiment of the 1st Garrison Brigade commanded by Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) *5th Regiment of the 3rd Garrison Brigade commanded by Huang Luobin (ÈªÑÁΩóÊñå) *6th Cavalry Division of the communist 4th Column *Gao Xuewen Independent Battalion commanded by Gao Xuewen (È´òÂ≠¶Êñá) *Northern Wei (guerrilla) Column commanded by Yao Pengfei (ÂßöÈπèÈ£û) Commanders The nationalist frontline commander was General Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥), Ma Bufang's only son. Awarded with the rank of colonel at the age of 16 to become a deputy regimental commander, Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) was one of Ma Bufang's favorite field commanders. By the ago of 20, Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) was awarded the rank of major general and attended training courses for generals at the Nationalist Party of China Army Officer Academy. Just barely two months ago, Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) had led his nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division into victory against another main communist force, the communist 2nd Column led by Wang Zhen in Heshui Campaign and the young nationalist general who was only 28 years old at the time was still immersed in the previous victory and was determined to achieve another victory of similar or great scale. The communist commander of the regular troops Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) was not as familiarized with the local situation as the local communists, but he was assisted by a brilliant local communist commander, Wang Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••), who first joined the communists in 1934. In 1935, the four communist guerrilla forces operating in Xinning (Êñ∞ÂÆÅ) region were annihilated by the nationalists, with the First Squadron of the Third Group suffering the most: in less than a year, six guerrilla commanders were killed in battles consecutively. In 1936, the 20-year-old Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) became the commander, and within six months, the guerrilla originally was just going to finally collapse had its fortune completely reversed: not only it survived, its rank boosted to over 200 and became the only communist guerrilla force survived in the region. Due to his excellent record, Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) was promoted to several posts at the same time: he was both the political commissar of the 1st Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade and the political commissar of the communist western Guanzhong command, the communist party secretary of the Xinning (Êñ∞ÂÆÅ) county, and the communist propaganda minister. However, Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) was suffering from typhus, but he nonetheless fought at the frontline in this campaign, and on August 15, 1947, he was among the first to discover the massive nationalist troop deployment at Golden Village Temple (Jin Cun Miao, ÈáëÊùëÂ∫ô) region. Strategies As the communist 4th Column headquarters with its 6th Cavalry Division entered the Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town in the heart of the Meridian Ridge (Zi Wu Ling, Â≠êÂçàÂ≤≠), they were detected by the nationalist scouts in the western part of the mountain. Nationalist response was immediate: once the intelligence from the scouts was received on August 13, 1947, the nationalists sprung into action to exterminate the enemy. The nationalist strategy planned by Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) was to first encircle the enemy within 24 hours, and then annihilate the enemy within the encirclement. Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) would personally lead the campaign. In order to achieve the objective, the entire nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was mobilized in the following manner: *The nationalist Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment would be the vanguard in the center *The nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade would be at the right flank *The nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade would be at the left flank * Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) would personally lead 4 battalions following the main forces Once the pincer movement was completed, encirclement of the enemy was achieved and it would only be a matter of time before the enemy would be completely annihilated. The nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division began its move on August 13, 1947. The original communist strategy was to disengage the enemy and not to fight, because after Yulin Campaign, the communist 4th Column was tasked to penetrate behind the enemy line to cut off the Lanzhou ‚Äì Xining Highway, thus threatening the nationalist flank in the rear so that the nationalist force there would be tied down and could not be deployed against communists in other areas. After the communist scouts first discovered the nationalist troops camping at the regions of Teeth Village (Ya Cun, ÁâôÊùë) and Golden Village Temple (Jin Cun Miao, ÈáëÊùëÂ∫ô), the commander of the communist 4th Column, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) originally planned to follow his order by disengaging the nationalists by retreating, but the strong opposition of local communists forced him to change his mind. Following the defeat of communists in Heshui Campaign, the victorious nationalists immediately launched eradication operations against the local communists and their bases in the Meridian Ridge. In the two months-long struggles, the local communists (including local garrison force and guerrilla forces) had suffered greatly in the hand of nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division. Local communists strongly wanted the field commanders to organize a counteroffensive against the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division to avenge the death of their comrades. Communists such as the deputy communist party secretary of the Guanzhong region, Zhao Boping (Ëµµ‰ºØÂπ≥) claimed that they could not left the civilian behind, and consequently, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) sent out scout to check out the enemy strength. However, the communist scouts had made a grave error in that they mistakenly believed advance guard of the nationalist vanguard, the Independent 5th Cavalry regiment was the entire nationalist force deployed, not realizing that the entire nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was soon to follow, and reported back that the enemy strength was only a regiment strong. Based on this erroneous report, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) the communist commander was confident that with the current communist strength, they were able to annihilate the enemy and made plans accordingly to ambush the nationalists to the west of Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town: *The 2nd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade was deployed to the west of Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town. *The 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade was deployed to New Village (Xin Zhuang, Êñ∞Â∫Ñ) *The 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade was to outflank the enemy from the north of Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town and cutting off the escaping route of the enemy *The 6th Cavalry Division of the communist 4th Column was deployed to Peach Tree Village (Tao Shu Zhuang, Ê°ÉÊ†ëÂ∫Ñ) act as reserve The communists began their deployment in the early morning of August 15, 1947. First battle After Xihuachi Campaign, the nationalists adjusted their deployment and the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division of Ma clique was tasked to encircle the communist base in the Meridian Ridge with other nationalist units commanded by Hu Zongnan. The Reorganized 100th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was stationed at Ning (ÂÆÅ) County, the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division stationed at Qingyang, and the brigade-strength Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment (later to be expanded into the 248th Division) of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division stationed at Zhengning (Ê≠£ÂÆÅ). General Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥)'s plan would require the entire division to complete, but the bad weather had prevented the nationalists from taking full advantage of their cavalry. The heavy rain severely slowed down the marching of the nationalist formation, and it took an entire day to for the nationalist force to reach its designated position. On August 14, 1947, the heavy rain in eastern Gansu had finally stopped. The nationalist advanced guard consisted of the nationalist Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment and the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade made contact with the enemy at regions of Golden Village Temple (Jin Cun Miao, ÈáëÊùëÂ∫ô) and Dou Family's Ridge (Dou Jia Liang Ë±ÜÂÆ∂Ê¢Å) near Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town. The communist local garrison Gao Xuewen (È´òÂ≠¶Êñá) Independent Regiment fought a delay action while gradually retreating eastward, finally disengaged the enemy, but the nationalists were not able to resume their rapid push by taking advantage of the good weather as they had hoped, because they were further blocked by another communist guerrilla force, the Northern Wei (Weibei Ê∏≠Âåó) Column at Fu Family's Village (Fu Jia Zhuang, ‰ªòÂÆ∂Â∫Ñ). Although the nationalists managed to driven the enemy from their positions and severely wounding the communist guerrilla commander Yao Pengfei (ÂßöÈπèÈ£û), the blocking actions fought by these communist units had provided the much needed times for the communists to evacuate and redeploy. Change of plans By the morning of August 15, 1947, the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade and the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade in the north was finally detected by the communist agents. The communist party secretary of Heshui (ÂêàÊ∞¥) County, Li Ke (ÊùéÁßë), the first high ranking communist who received the information, immediately went to the communist headquarters at Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town to inform his comrades that the enemy they faced was not just merely the nationalist Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment, but the entire nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division. This important piece of intelligence shocked the communist command, which immediately changed the plan from the original ambush to blocking actions to cover an emergency retreat, because the communists were well aware that the enemy enjoyed absolute technical superiority and the communists themselves did not have absolute numerical superiority either. Though the communists attempted to disengage, it was simply impossible. The terrain favored the nationalist cavalry and limited the speed of communist withdraw. The same terrain also prevented the communist runners from reaching the units in the field in time due to the lack of radio communication equipments on the communist side. When the communist units in the field had received the order to retreat, they were already in contact with the enemy, so blocking actions had to be fought. The communist commander Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) had to redeploy his units by assigning the 2nd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade to hold the Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town, the 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade was deployed on the slope of mountain to the west of the town, the communist 6th Cavalry Division was deployed to the valley to the west of Peach Tree Village (Tao Shu Zhuang, Ê°ÉÊ†ëÂ∫Ñ), and the 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade originally planned to be deployed behind the enemy lines to encircle the enemy became the reserve. The original nationalist plan also failed to materialize. The nationalist frontline commander-in-chief Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) was furious that the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade led by commander Ma Buluan (È©¨Ê≠•ÈäÆ) tasked with outflanking the enemy from the left was nowhere near the battlefield. After radio communication, Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) learned that heavy rain and mud slides had prevented the cavalries from reaching its top speed and it would be the evening for the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade to reach the battlefield. The nationalists simply could not wait that long and Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) decided to begin the assault on the enemy before the encirclement was completed: the nationalist Independent 5th Regiment led by commander Ma Bukang (È©¨Ê≠•Â∫∑) was at the right, the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade was at the left, and the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade was the general reserve. The general attack would be launched at 10:00 AM on August 15, 1947. 2nd battle At 10:00 AM, the nationalist cavalry launched their attack on the enemy positions held by the communist 3rd Regiment of the 1st Garrison Brigade by first bombarding the enemy. The defenders managed to repeatedly beat back nationalists assaults but suffered heavy casualties in the process: the crack troop of the regiment, Mu Chengguang (Á©ÜÊàêÂÖâ) Platoon, a heroic platoon named after its platoon commander Mu Chengguang (Á©ÜÊàêÂÖâ), was completed annihilated with every member in the platoon killed. The fight last until the afternoon when the communist 3rd Regiment of the 1st Garrison Brigade finally received the order to retreat which was first issued before the battle had started, and the defenders gradually retreated eastward. The 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade defending the most northwestern position did not receive the order to retreat in time, and was totally surrounded by the attacking nationalist cavalries. Most of the members including the deputy company commander Yang Zhankui (Êù®Âç†Â•é) were killed, and the company commander Wang Sanxu (Áéã‰∏âÁª™) jumped off the cliff after exhausted the last round of ammunition, but he was lucky that he survived, and after he was recovered from his severe injury weeks later, he returned to his original post. By 4:00 PM, the 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade successfully retreated and disengaged the enemy, while the 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade took over to continue the fight of delaying actions with the pursuing nationalists. At the same time, the 2nd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade and the 6th Cavalry Division at the flanks also engaged the nationalists in their fights to delay the enemy, and the communist force soon disengaged the pursuing nationalists and began their planned retreat. Communist retreat The organized retreat planned by the communists did not turn out as expected because the road was congested with large numbers of donkeys carrying supplies, thus preventing communist units from reaching their predestinated positions. In the afternoon of August 15, 1947, while on his way from the Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town to the local communist headquarters located at the region of Black Wind Bump (He Feng Ge Da, ÈªëÈ£éÁñôÁò©), political commissar Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) discovered that the nationalist cavalry was outflanking the communists by moving toward the region of Northern Firewood Bridge (ÂåóÊü¥Ê°•) from the region of Yang Family's Plateau (Yang Jia Yuan, Êù®ÂÆ∂Â°¨). In the meantime, another nationalist cavalry force outflanked the communists from the other direction by moving toward Peach Tree Village (Tao Shu Zhuang, Ê°ÉÊ†ëÂ∫Ñ), from the region of Papaya Plateau (Mu Gua Yuan, Êú®ÁìúÂ°¨), in an attempt to cut off the escaping route of the communists. By this time, the main communist force, the 4th Column, had already withdrawn from the battlefield and disengaged the enemy. The remaining local communist garrison was in danger being annihilated. On his returning trip, the communist political commissar Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) met the retreating remnant of the 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison by chance and realized that the situation was desperate for the communists. By this time, the communist order of general retreat finally reached every communist unit in the field and everyone was to disengage the enemy by 3:00 PM, and then retreat eastward at night in different groups. By the evening, all remaining communist units had successful disengaged the enemy and successfully escaped eastward, joining the main communist force that retreated from the battlefield earlier. The commander of the communist 4th Column, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) handed the wounded and the sick to the local communist units, and told the local communists that the 4th Column would continue to retreat southeastward to Red Water (Chi Shui Ëµ§Ê∞¥), and Xunyi (Êó¨ÈÇë) regions, where they would finally meet after continuing retreating in separate ways. Nationalist pursuit The rapid communist retreat made the nationalists very suspicious, fearing that it was just another trap to lure them into yet another ambush. By 3:00 p.m. on August 15, 1947, the firepower of resisting communists subsided but the cautious nationalists did not move forward. After another hour, the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade launched a cavalry charge at the enemy, and realized that the enemy had already retreated. Carefully, the nationalist moved forward and by 6:00 PM, they took every position abandoned by the enemy to the west of Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town. By this time, the nationalist Reorganized 8th Brigade under the command of Ma Buluan (È©¨Ê≠•ÈäÆ) finally arrived after being delayed by heavy rain for nearly 12 hours. Consequently, Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) was very unhappy because his original plan of encircling the enemy failed due to the delay. After a conference, the nationalist decided to pursuit the enemy at night. At night of August 15, 1947, the communist force divided into two, with one portion consisted of the 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade with high ranking local cadres (prefecture level), and this smaller force successfully evaded the pursuing nationalists by moving southward. Majority of the communist force continued its eastward retreat along the valley of Meridian Ridge. The local communists had drafted many donkeys to help to carry the supplies, and this had jammed the road, thus seriously slowed the speed, with the fleeing communists only moved 20 km for the entire night. The slow speed of fleeing communists was equally matched by the equally slow if not slower speed of pursuing nationalist cavalries. By midnight, the nationalist scouts reported to their commander-in-chief Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) that the terrain ahead was extremely difficult for cavalries and there were dense forest that was perfectly for the enemy to lay an ambush. After being continuously harassed by the enemy ambushes, the cautious nationalists decided to stop completely to camp, and then continue the pursuit in the morning. In deed, the darkness had helped the communists, and Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) with his communist forces successfully reached the safety at Kang Family's Plateau in the night of August 15, 1947 by going northwestward. 3rd battle In the morning of August 16, 1947, the vanguard of the nationalist force, the nationalist Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment caught up with the slowing moving communist 4th Column, whose retreat was bogged down with enormous supplies it carried. The battle broke out around 10:00 AM, between the nationalist Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment and the communist rear guard, the 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Brigade, which immediately occupied the peaks of the mountains as the position of the blocking action, covering the main communist force to continue their retreat eastward. As the battle ensued, the nationalist commander-in-chief Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) ordered scouts to be dispatched to find out the exact strength of the enemy. By noon, nationalist heavy weaponry had arrived. Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) ordered the Reorganized 100th Brigade to attack the enemy positions but the nationalist assaults were repeatedly beaten back. After an hour futile efforts, Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) then changed his tactic by ordering the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade and the Independent 5th Cavalry Brigade to outflank the enemy, while the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade would bypass the enemy position to continue the pursuit of the main enemy force in retreat. At 1:00 PM, the nationalists launched another round of offensive with their new tactic. Huang Luobing (ÈªÑÁΩóÊñå), the commander of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade leading the communist 5th Regiment, realized that the blocking action was no longer meaningful since nationalist cavalries had begun to bypass the communist positions to pursuit the main communist force in retreat. He also realized that the nationalists were encircling his troops, which were in danger of being wiped out. Commander Huang Luobing (ÈªÑÁΩóÊñå) immediately ordered his troops to retreat northward to Locust Tree Village (Huai Shu Zhuang, ÊßêÊ†ëÂ∫Ñ), and the former-guerrilla soldiers acted so swiftly that by 4:00 PM, they had completely shaken off the nationalists in pursuit. However, they had withdrawn too fast, that not only the enemy lost contact with them, but their comrades in other communist units lost contact with them as well. Compounding the problem, the retreating 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Brigade did not even bother to make contact with other communist units after reaching safety, which resulted in disastrous consequence: the communist main force led by Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) in retreat was later caught up by the pursuing nationalist cavalries. Further retreat Leading two battalions, large number of civilian cadres, and burdened with tremendous supplies, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) continued the retreat until the evening, when the fleeing communists were finally able to have their first break, and held a conference regarding their next move. In order to avoid being annihilated by the enemy together, the communists decided to disengage the pursuing enemy in small groups. Majority of the communist force would go southeastward toward Construction Village (Jian Zhuang, Âª∫Â∫Ñ), and the remaining communist force would be personally led by Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) to go northward to Zheng Ning (Ê≠£ÂÆÅ) county, where the local nationalist garrison, the Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment had already left long ago to become the vanguard of nationalists chasing the fleeing communists. Taking advantage of dark night, the communist force broke up and began their march at night of in rain. The bulk of the communist force including the communist 6th Cavalry Division, part of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade and all of civilian cadres under the command of Gao Jinchun (È´òÈî¶Á∫Ø) made a successful retreat after abandoning most equipment and supplies, and finally reached the safety of Yijun (ÂÆúÂêõ) county of Shaanxi after crossing the Meridian Ridge. The smaller communist force led by Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) was far less fortunate. After the breakup of his force, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) led his formation southwestward, in an attempt to disengage the pursuing nationalists by going behind the enemy line. However, the rapid response of the nationalist cavalry ruined his plan by following closely, and by the afternoon of August 17, 1947, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) still could not shake off the nationalists when they reached the Eagle's Feather's Pass (Diao Ling Guan, ÈõïÁøéÂÖ≥) at the border of Shaanxi and Gansu. Seeing his troops had not had any rest in two days and two nights straight, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) devised a new plan. The commander of the communist 3rd Garrison Regiment, Ge Haizhou (ËëõÊµ∑Ê¥≤), would lead the 1st Battalion of the communist 3rd Garrison Regiment to engage the pursuing nationalists and lead them northward, away from the 2nd and the 3rd Battalion of the communist 3rd Garrison Regiment. Luck was on the communist side as the nationalists were lured away and the communists at the Eagle's Feather's Pass (Diao Ling Guan, ÈõïÁøéÂÖ≥) were able to get the rest they desperately needed. Luck proved to be once again on the communist side when the heavy rain and dark nights had enabled the 1st Battalion of the communist 3rd Garrison Regiment to successfully evade the pursuing nationalist cavalries. Final decisions On August 17, 1947, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) held another conference after dark at the Eagle's Feather's Pass (Diao Ling Guan, ÈõïÁøéÂÖ≥), and decided to send two officers, Niu Shushen (Áâõ‰π¶Áî≥) and Liu Yinggon (ÂàòÊáãÂäü) to make contact with the communist 2nd Garrison Regiment that stayed behind to cover the retreat. Once the contact was reestablished, they would rejoin the communist 3rd Garrison Regiment to return to Guanzhong for the desperately needed rest. Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) and his staff officer Gao Weisong (È´òÁª¥Âµ©) would lead the headquarters staff of the communist 3rd Garrison Regiment to return to eastern Gansu to look for the 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Regiment. Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) believed that the pursuing nationalists had already penetrated deep into the Meridian Ridge following him, and if he and his force could cut behind the enemy line, the unexpected move would ensure their safety. Unfortunately, he was totally wrong this time. By the evening of August 17, 1947, Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) was a little depressed because after last engagement with the enemy on the day before, the enemy main force was nowhere to be found. Furthermore, the search and destroy operation became increasingly difficult because the thick forest and mountainous terrain had greatly reduced the effectiveness of cavalry. Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) voiced his concern to his father Ma Bufang at Xining via radio, and the latter immediately order the general retreat by claiming that the nationalist force was in danger of being ambushed in the enemy's heartland where even Hu Zongnan dared not to venture this far. Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) realized the potential danger his force would face, especially when the main force of the enemy was not heard from since Yulin Campaign, and had it being hiding nearby for an ambush, the nationalist force deep in the heartland of enemy would be in danger of being wiped out. As a result, Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) ordered a general retreat to be carried out the next day at dawn. This meant that the communist and the nationalist paths would met, a situation the communists desperately attempt to avoid. Conclusion The nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division retreated toward Xifeng, Heshui (ÂêàÊ∞¥), and Qingyang via the same route it entered the heart of the communist base. The 2nd Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was the nationalist unit that struck the deepest blow into the enemy's heartland, and it was at most eastward position when received the general retreat order. By the afternoon of August 18, 1947, the nationalist regiment made its way back to the Peach Tree Village (Tao Shu Zhuang, Ê°ÉÊ†ëÂ∫Ñ) of near Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian, ‰πùÂ≤ò) Town, and met the small retreating headquarters force of the communist 4th Column led by its commander Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞). A short battle ensued and both side chose not to continue to engage the enemy. After retreating to the safety at the Papaya Plateau (Mu Gua Yuan, Êú®ÁìúÂ°¨), Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) heard gunshots in the direction of Peach Tree Village (Tao Shu Zhuang, Ê°ÉÊ†ëÂ∫Ñ), and he immediately led his guerrilla to the direction of gunshots to reinforce their comrades. However, before they could join the battle, the gunshots stopped when they had just reached Gao Family's Col (Gao Jia Ao, È´òÂÆ∂Âù≥). Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) and his guerrilla observed that there were several dozen communist cavalries retreating along the mountain ridge. Several days later, Wang Bingxian (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) and his guerrilla fighters learnt that those retreating communists cavalries were actually the members of the headquarters staff of the communist 4th Column, including their superior Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞). Ma Fushou (È©¨Á¶èÂØø), the commander of the second Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division had ready received order to withdraw, and was on his way retreating toward the region of Golden Village Temple (Jin Cun Miao ÈáëÊùëÂ∫ô), thus did not pursuit the fleeing enemy. Had the nationalists known that the group included the highest communist commander of Guanzhong, they would certainly give a chase and Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞) and his staff would not be able to escape for sure. Aftermath At night of August 18, 1947, heavy rain poured down. Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) led his troops in retreat without any provisions. Out of desperation, many of his soldiers took cotton out of their uniform and soaked the cotton in lubricants of the rifle, and used the makeshift torch for warmth. Due to the insufficient camp ground, many of the soldiers slept in the rain. Other communist units fared no better: an acting company commander named Liang Manping (Ê¢ÅÊª°Âπ≥) of the 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade led his remaining troops spent days in a yaodong, and being the first time on his own to independently leading a formation, he was afraid of something bad happened and did not sleep for three days and three nights. When Wang Bingxiang (ÁéãÁßâÁ••) and his unit found Liang Manping (Ê¢ÅÊª°Âπ≥) and his troops in the morning of August 19, 1947, Liang Manping (Ê¢ÅÊª°Âπ≥) was so happy that he shouted:‚ÄùI was worried to death, and it was so good to find you! I would no longer harbor any individualism and I would never want to be an officer again!‚Äù Before anyone could answer, Liang Manping (Ê¢ÅÊª°Âπ≥) dropped down and fell into deep sleep that he had to be carried away on a stretcher because nobody could wake him up. Other communist commanders were less fortunate. Wan Sanxu (Áéã‰∏âÁª™), the commander of the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the communist 3rd Garrison Regiment managed to survive and recover after jumping off the cliff, and then returned to command his unit, but the casualties his company suffered was so high that over 70% of the soldiers in his company consisted of former-nationalist prisoner-of-war. The morale of the new soldiers was low, their loyalty was uncertain, and their capability was inadequate, all of which was proved soon, at the cost of Wan Sanxu (Áéã‰∏âÁª™)'s life. Four months later during Yichuan Campaign, in a battle at the Southern Pagoda Ridge (Nan Ta Liang, ÂçóÂ°îÊ¢Å) at White Water (Bai Shui, ÁôΩÊ∞¥) region of Shaanxi, Wan Sanxu (Áéã‰∏âÁª™) was shot and killed while leading a retreat by his own soldiers, who were former-nationalist prisoners-of-war. Wan Sanxu (Áéã‰∏âÁª™) was 44 years old. On August 22, 1947, Wang Shitai (Áéã‰∏ñÊ≥∞), the commander of the communist 4th Column found the 5th Regiment of the 3rd Garrison Brigade led by Huang Luobing (ÈªÑÁΩóÊñå) at Locust Tree Village (Huai Shu Zhuang, ÊßêÊ†ëÂ∫Ñ), the communists regrouped at Xihuaichi (Ë•øÂçéÊ±†) region of the Heshui (ÂêàÊ∞¥) county and rested for ten days. The communist 1st Garrison Brigade rested at Yijun (ÂÆúÂêõ) county of Shaanxi. Local communist units from Guanzhong were incorporated into the communist 2nd and the 3rd Garrison Regiments to make up the combat loss. Two months later, the communist 1st and 3rd Brigades were reassigned to the 4th Column to strength the communist column. The nationalist victory was incomplete because Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) was too prudent. Fearing enemy ambush in the heart of communist territory (a very legitimate concern), and not knowing the truth strength of the enemy, the nationalists withdrew too quickly and did not bother to destroy the supplies and weaponry the fleeing enemy abandoned, majority of which was recovered by the communists within several days immediately after the nationalist withdraw. The 6th Cavalry Division of the communist 4th Column abandoned three mountain guns in its retreat and the nationalists captured them and as symbolic gesture, they were sent to Xi'an as exhibits of their Meridian Ridge Victory exhibition. Outcome The communist defeat had exposed it main problem: the guerrilla was still heavily influenced by its guerrilla tactics and did not adjust well to modern conventional warfare. The 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade performed poorly due to its guerrilla practice, and when it withdrew from the battle without permission, other communist units were endangered. Furthermore, after withdrawing to Locust Tree Village (Huai Shu Zhuang, ÊßêÊ†ëÂ∫Ñ), none of the commanders and soldiers of the 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade made any attempt to contact their superior or other communist units during their entire six-day-long stay at the village. A communist since 1929, Huang Luobing (ÈªÑÁΩóÊñå), the commander of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade was an expert in guerrilla warfare, and he rose in ranks from an ordinary guerrilla soldier thru his excellence. However, the only experience in conventional warfare Huang had was as the commander-in-chief of the eastern sub-district of Northern Shaanxi Military District and as the chief-of-staff of the Security Headquarters of the communist base in northwestern China, but he had never directed any conventional battles. However, communists had obviously not learnt anything from their defeat and thus paid a heavy price in later conflicts: In 1948, during the Western Shaanxi-Eastern Gansu Campaign, the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade was tasked to protect the right flank of the attacking communist force but it was unable to stop the nationalist counterattack led by the nationalist general Pei Changhui (Ë£¥Êòå‰ºö) and the former-guerrilla turned regular unit withdrew into Linyou (È∫üÊ∏∏) mountains, exposing the Peng Dehuai's headquarters and the communist main force at Baoji. Had not been the New 4th Brigade of the communist 6th Column fought hard to stop the nationalists, Peng Dehuai would have been killed and the headquarters of the communist First Field Army would have been totally destroyed. Peng Dehuai and his headquarters of the communist First Field Army would meet a similar danger several days later when the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade once again made the same debacle: when the attacking communists withdrew to Northern Shaanxi via Eastern Gansu, Peng Dehuai ordered the 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade to guard the region from Duzi (Â±ØÂ≠ó) town to Xiaojing (ËêßÈáë) to secure the safe passage for the headquarters and the communist 1st, 4th and 6th columns. When the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade approached the Duzi (Â±ØÂ≠ó) town, it discovered that town was already occupied by its nemesis: the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division. Without asking the permission and reporting the discovery, the 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade withdrew southward to Taiping (Â§™Âπ≥) Town. As a result, the divisional headquarters of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division led by Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥) met head on with the headquarters of the communist First Field Army led by Peng Dehuai, who was unaware of the situation. Both sides were extremely cautious in the battle because neither knew the strength of the other, and had the nationalist unit not commanded by Ma Jiyuan (È©¨ÁªßÊè¥), but any other lower ranking officers who would attack aggressively, Peng Dehuai would have been killed once again and the headquarters of the communist First Field Army would have been totally destroyed for sure. After the Western Shaanxi-Eastern Gansu Campaign, Peng Dehuai angrily criticized Huang Luobing (ÈªÑÁΩóÊñå), claiming that the mistake he had made would be sufficient to have him executed. As a result, Huang Luobing (ÈªÑÁΩóÊñå) was kicked out of military and transferred to a job as civilian administer. Had the communists learned the problem of the former-guerillas earlier during the Meridian Ridge Campaign and remedied the problem back then, they would not have to face the danger later on in Western Shaanxi-Eastern Gansu Campaign. The nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division of Ma clique once again dealt a heavy blow to its long term adversary, the units of the communist First Field Army, just as it had done earlier in Heshui Campaign. Had Ma Bufang not interfered with the command at the last stage and the nationalists continued their offensive, the nationalist victory would have been much bigger and the communists would have suffered much greater loss.

It was popular in the first few decades of the 20th century in the United States, since most houses did not have built-in kitchen cabinetry. The Hoosier Manufacturing Co. of New Castle, Indiana, was one of the earliest and largest manufacturers of this product, causing the term \\"Hoosier cabinet\\" to become a generic term for that type of furniture. By 1920, the Hoosier Manufacturing Company had sold two million cabinets. Hoosier-style cabinets were also made by dozens of other companies, and most were in the Hoosier State or located nearby. Some of the larger manufacturers were Campbell-Smith-Ritchie (Boone); Coppes Brothers and Zook (the Napanee); McDougall Company; and G. I. Sellers and Sons. Hoosier cabinets evolved over the years to include more accessories and innovations that made life easier for cooks in the kitchen. They peaked in popularity in the 1920s, then declined as homes began to be constructed with built-in kitchen cabinets and counter tops. The Hoosier Manufacturing Company was sold in 1942 and liquidated. Today, Hoosier cabinets are valued by antique collectors. Background alt=Old kitchen from 1915 From 1890 to 1930, more houses were built in the United States than all of the country's prior years combined. Very few homes had built-in kitchen cabinets during the 19th century, and it was not until the late 1920s that built-in cabinets became a standard kitchen furnishing.. Around the 1890s, several furniture manufacturers in Indiana discovered that a stand-alone kitchen cabinet with storage and a workspace (essentially a baker's cabinet with extra storage) was easy to sell. It was a kitchen workstation with ingredient and equipment storage where the cook could complete all food preparation and not move until it was time to cook the food.. The Hoosier Manufacturing Company was one of those early manufacturers. In 1900, the company moved a short distance from Albany, Indiana to New Castle, Indiana. It began improving its manufacturing and distribution process, and was a strong believer in advertising. By 1906, it had 146 employees.. The company's product was nationally promoted as a step saver, and its popularity led to the term Hoosier cabinet becoming a generic term for that style of kitchen cabinet‚Äîsimilar to the term kleenex (the facial tissue called Kleenex manufactured by Kimberly-Clark) becoming a generic term for facial tissues. Hoosier cabinets were very popular from 1900 to 1930. Hoosier Manufacturing sold two million cabinets from its inception to 1920, and additional cabinets were sold by the company's competitors.. Given that there were approximately 20 million households in the US at that time, as much as 10% of homes had Hoosier cabinets made by Hoosier Manufacturing, and an additional unknown quantity had Hoosier cabinets made by competing companies.. Hoosier cabinets remained popular until the 1920s. By then houses were built with modern kitchens that included built-in cabinets, counter tops, and other fixtures. Thus supplanted, the Hoosier cabinet largely disappeared. Some manufacturers diversified into built-in cabinets and kitchen furniture. The Great Depression made sales more difficult. By 1935, Hoosier cabinets were considered \\"old fashioned\\".. The two largest manufacturers, Hoosier Manufacturing and G. I. Sellers and Sons, were closed in 1942 and 1950, respectively... Features alt=Old drawing of a stand-alone kitchen cabinet with hands pointing to featuresA Hoosier cabinet is a stand-alone kitchen cabinet on small casters. It is considered an improved version of a baker's cabinet. A baker's cabinet is a table with one or more bins underneath. It has a small work surface and a shallower upper section on top of the table that was used for storing bowls, pans, and kitchen utensils. The Hoosier cabinet expands on the baker's cabinet by offering a pull-out workspace/shelf and storage for everything a cook would need.. The base section usually has one large compartment with the slide-out shelf covered in metal that offers more workspace, and several drawers to one side. The top portion is shallower and has several smaller compartments with doors.. The majority of the Hoosier cabinets are about wide by deep by high. In addition to their storage capacity, they offer about of counter space that was not available in the standard kitchen of the early 20th century. A distinctive feature of the Hoosier cabinet is its many moving parts and accessories. As originally supplied, they were equipped with various racks and other hardware to hold and organize spices and various staples. One particularly distinctive item is the combination flour-bin/sifter, a hopper that could be used without having to remove it from the cabinet. A similar sugar bin was also common. Additional accessories and innovations were added over the years.. Special glass jars were manufactured to fit the cabinet and its racks. Original sets of Hoosier glassware consisted of coffee and tea canisters, a salt box, and four to eight spice jars. Some manufacturers also included a cracker jar. Colored glassware, ant-proof casters, and even ironing boards were innovations added later. Later models even included cards with reminders for grocery shopping and tips for meal planning.. Major manufacturers Hoosier cabinets were made mostly from the late 1890s through the 1930s, reaching their peak in popularity during the 1920s. The major manufacturers of Hoosier cabinets at that time were located in Indiana. Hoosier Manufacturing was the largest. Campbell-Smith-Ritchie Company alt=Old logo saying Boone Kitchen CabinetsThe company began as Campbell & Smith in 1892, and it was primarily a lumber yard and planing mill. Lebanon is the county seat of Boone County, Indiana, and Campbell-Smith- Ritchie named its Hoosier-style kitchen cabinets Boone Kitchen Cabinets in honor of the county. In 1905, the lumberyard was destroyed by fire. The company built a new facility on the edge of town. By 1910, its kitchen cabinet making business was doing so well that the lumberyard portion of the business was discontinued.. An Indiana inspection report for 1913 described the company as engaged in manufacturing furniture and having 90 employees.. It was also the largest employer inspected in Lebanon. The company advertised nationally, and claimed its product was designed by women from all over the nation. Models of the Boone cabinets were differentiated with names such as the Mary Boone, Bertha Boone (a larger model with storage closets at each end), and Betty Boone (a small model for apartments or smaller homes). Some included a hidden ironing board. The company, like many companies, prospered until the Great Depression. Demand for Hoosier cabinets declined at the time, first because of the difficult economic times, but also because homes began to be built with built‚Äìin cabinetry in the kitchen.. The company responded by cutting back on employee hours and diversifying into built-in kitchen cabinets and breakfast dining sets. This strategy enabled it to survive into 1940 when it was sold. The company continued for another 18 months, but was then liquidated.. Coppes Brothers and Zook alt=Old logo with Dutch woman profileThe Coppes Brothers and Zook decided to concentrate on kitchen cabinets in 1914. Their manufacturing facility was located in Nappanee, Indiana, and their Hoosier cabinet brand name was the Napanee Dutch Kitchenet (spelled with only one \\"p\\").. Using data from a study by a famous efficiency engineer (Harrington Emerson), the company claimed that their product could save 1,592 steps per day. Earlier, the Coppes brothers had a sawmill business, a box manufacturing factory, and a furniture manufacturing company. An Indiana inspection report for 1913 described their company (named Coppes, Zook, and Mutschler Co. at that time) as a \\"saw mill, etc.\\" and having 178 employees in a town with a population of 2,260.. Right before the Great Depression started, the company began manufacturing built-in kitchen cabinets. This product was very successful, and continued for many years after the demise of the Hoosier cabinets. The Coppes Napanee company remains in business to this day and is the longest-continuously-operating cabinet manufacturer in the United States.. Hoosier Manufacturing Company alt=Old drawing of woman and her kitchen cabinetThe Hoosier Manufacturing Co. began in Albany, Indiana in the year 1898. The founders were glassmaker James McQuinn, his son Emmett McQuinn, and two business partners from Muncie, Indiana‚ÄîJohn M. Maring, and Thomas Hart. Maring and Hart served as the president and vice president, respectively. The two McQuinns ran the business, with the elder McQuinn as the plant's general manager.. The younger McQuinn was the advertising manager.. Originally, the company used a former furniture manufacturing plant to make a seed separator used on farms. A secondary product, a stand-alone kitchen cabinet, sold better than the seed separator‚Äîand quickly became the company's main product. Each of the early Hoosier Cabinets was hand‚Äìmade.. The cabinet was similar to a baker's cabinet, with storage bins below a work space and a two-door upper section. However, the Hoosier Cabinet had \\"meticulously organized interior storage\\", which enabled it to serve as a kitchen workstation with all the necessary equipment and material within arm's reach.. The company's Albany facility was destroyed by a fire in 1900. At that time, the owners decided to restart in New Castle, Indiana, which is located about south of Albany. A profile of the McQuinns from a 1902 publication discussed the New Castle facility, and said that the \\"output of the factory now amounts to nearly 200 complete kitchen cabinets per week, and sales are made of the article in every state in the Union, and many foreign countries.\\". In addition to its product, Hoosier Manufacturing's success can be attributed to its strengths in advertising, distribution, and manufacturing.. Hoosier Manufacturing created its own dealer network, since some furniture dealers were not fond of a product that competed with their wares. In cases where they had no dealer, products were sold directly from the factory.. The company was also a strong believer in advertising. Advertising was conducted in newspapers and national magazines such as Ladies' Home Journal and The Saturday Evening Post, where the reader was likely to be a woman. In 1903, the company began streamlining its manufacturing process by using interchangeable hardware, standardizing its products, and using an assembly line.. The employee responsible for these innovations, Harry Hall, was also granted patents related to innovations for the cabinet and for a safety apparatus. By 1913, Hoosier Manufacturing, listed as a furniture maker by Indiana factory inspectors, had 470 employees.. In 1916, the company sold its one millionth Hoosier Cabinet and was clearly the leader in free-standing kitchen cabinets. By 1920, two million had been sold. During its peak years, the company produced nearly 700 cabinets per day, and was the largest manufacturer of kitchen cabinets in the United States. Free‚Äìstanding kitchen cabinets began declining in popularity by 1930, and Hoosier Manufacturing responded by making kitchen cabinets that were meant to be built-in to the home. The company also began manufacturing kitchen tables and breakfast sets. During World War II, supplies and man-power became scarce. The company was sold and liquidated in 1942. McDougall alt=Old drawing of two woman admiring a kitchen cabinetMcDougall was one of the early manufacturers of a Hoosier cabinet. An advertisement from 1919 identified the McDougall as \\"the first kitchen cabinet\\". George McDougall began the McDougall Company in Indianapolis, Indiana, sometime after the Civil War. The company's products were pie safes and kitchen tables. In 1898, the company name was changed to G. P. McDougall and Son. George's son Charles traveled to learn more about the furniture business, and persuaded his father to equip their kitchen tables with flour bins‚Äîa product that eventually became known as baker's cabinets. Charles also traveled to Europe and the European influence can be seen on McDougall cabinets. In 1909, a disgruntled employee set the factory on fire, destroying the entire facility.. Charles McDougall, with several business partners, restarted the business in Frankfort, Indiana, in 1910. The company was named McDougall Company, and Hoosier cabinets were its product. The plant utilized the latest technology for furniture manufacturing. The McDougall Hoosier cabinet had a patented auto-front roll door that dropped down instead of rolling up. Its flour bin had a glass front to show the flour level in the bin.. In 1913, the McDougall plant had 148 employees, making it the largest (based on employees) factory in Frankfort.. Near the end of the 1920s, the McDougall front door was changed to be similar to those used by other Hoosier cabinets. Its flour bins were made smaller. The Great Depression was difficult. The company was reorganized in 1931. The company lasted a few years before closing.. Sellers alt=Old logo saying Sellers KitcheneedThe G. I. Sellers Company was founded in Kokomo, Indiana, in 1888. The company made chifforobes, cabinets, and tables‚Äîand oak was their choice material. They grew to become the second largest manufacturer of Hoosier cabinets. By 1905, their manufacturing complex covered five city blocks. During that year, their plant was destroyed by fire. In order to restart their business as soon as possible, the company purchased a furniture factory in Elwood, Indiana. At that time, the company name was changed to the G. I. Sellers and Sons Company, and manufacturing was focused on Hoosier cabinets and tables.. By 1913, the Sellers plant employed 99 people, making it the second largest factory (based on employees) in Elwood.. Among features Sellers promoted were an automatic lowering flour bin, glass drawer pulls, hand-rubbed finish on oak, and ant- proof casters.. The company initiated a \\"Votes for Women\\" contest for little girls in 1914. Prizes were Junior Special Kitcheneed Cabinets, which were two‚Äìthirds the size of the Sellers Kitcheneed Special. In 1922, Wilfred Sellers (company president) noted that the company typically produced 75,000 to 85,000 cabinets per year. Sellers introduced its Kitchenaire models in 1927, which had smaller flour bins but more drawers. In the early 1930s, coloring was featured, and new products were sold such as built-in kitchen cabinets and breakfast sets. During World War II, the company had difficulty acquiring raw materials and employing skilled workers. It ceased operations in 1950. Other manufacturers Between 1899 and 1949, over 40 manufacturers of stand-alone kitchen cabinets are known to have existed, and 18 of them were located in Indiana.. Many of these manufacturers had much smaller advertising budgets compared to the major manufacturers, and it can be difficult to find information about them. Factory inspectors for the state of Indiana list at least eight companies, in addition to the major manufacturers, as kitchen cabinet makers in Indiana in 1913. Those companies are Cardinal Cabinet Company (Wabash), Greencastle Cabinet Company (Greencastle), Paul Manufacturing Company (Fort Wayne), Roach-Brown Manufacturing (Indianapolis), C. F. Schmoe Furniture Company (Shelbyville), Showers Brothers (Bloomington), Spiegle Cabinet Company (Shelbyville), and Wasmuch, Endicott Company (Andrews). Hoosier cabinets could also be mail-ordered from Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and Company. * Ariel Cabinet Company of Peru, Indiana, which made the Ariel Handy Helper kitchen cabinet, was incorporated in 1920.

The company was founded in 1906, and had 33 employees in 1915. * Kalamazoo Stove Company made the Kalamazoo Kitchen Kabinet in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The product was all-metal and white- enameled. The company was listed as a stove manufacturer in 1915 by inspectors from the Michigan Department of Labor. It had 205 employees, and was founded in 1901.. * Landau Cabinet Company of St. Louis, Missouri, was organized in 1906. Its plant occupied an entire city block.

Young Industries who planned to use it for manufacturing farm implements. * Showers Brothers, established in 1868, had three factories in Bloomington, Indiana, and one in Iowa. They built many types of furniture, including Hoosier cabinets. In 1913, they had 499 employees.. * Spiegel Cabinet Company began in 1925 as an expansion company of the Spiegel Furniture Company, and manufactured kitchen cabinets. It closed in 1950.. * Vincennes Furniture Manufacturing Company used Ideal as the trade name for its products. This company was established in Vincennes, Indiana, in 1902. It built tables, kitchen cabinets, cupboards, dressers, and bookcases.. It had 75 employees in 1913. * Wasmuch-Endicott Company touted \\"the smooth surface round corner\\" kitchen cabinet in their Kitchen Maid brand Hoosier cabinets. Their motto was \\"Let the Kitchen Maid be Your Kitchen Aid\\". Features included round corners, crystal glass, automatic sugar bin, bread box, and sifter flour bin. * Wilson kitchen cabinets were sold by Sears. Today A child size Hoosier cabinet made by Sellers on display at alt=wooden furniture piece with shallower shelves on top of a table with storage underneath Hoosier cabinets can be found on display in museums such as the Henry Ford Museum, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, and the Kentucky Museum. However, Hoosier cabinets are found in other places too. Numerous antique dealers and restoration companies are involved with Hoosiers because nostalgic homeowners want this piece of furniture in their home. People are also interested in reproductions of the Hoosier cabinet. One author credits the work of Philip and Phyllis Kennedy for boosting the popularity of Hoosier cabinets. The Kennedys researched the cabinet's history and procedures for restoration during the 1980s.. In a 1999 book, another author discussing the Hoosier cabinet mentioned that some cooks are \\"scouring antique stores, farm auctions, and flea markets for this unique, and still useful, piece of Americana.\\". Restored Hoosier cabinets are often sought after for use in early-twentieth-century-style kitchens, in homes from that era or in new homes built in the styles of that era.\\" In 2004, Hoosier cabinets sold at auction were often priced at over $1,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Oak versions with all of the accessories (flour bin, sugar bin, glass spice jars, etc.) have sold for over $2,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Cabinets without the original accessories are typically lower priced. Some of the accessories, such as the flour sifters and the spice jars made by Sneath Glass also sell quickly. As always, beware of counterfeits and Hoosier Manufacturing nameplates added to old cabinets. \\"Hoosier cabinets live on as more than inspiration for new varieties of kitchen furniture. A hundred years after their rise to prominence, restored originals and recent reproductions have become cherished objects in many a home.\\". \\"The cabinets' sheer eccentricity, combined with their attractiveness as historic artifacts, has earned them a following equal to that of any group of collectors.\\".

The name refers to the class of preferred stock sold to investors in exchange for their investment. It is usually the first series of stock after the common stock and common stock options issued to company founders, employees, friends and family and angel investors. Description In America, Series A preferred stock is the first round of stock offered during the seed or early stage round by a portfolio company to the venture capital investor. Series A preferred stock is often convertible into common stock in certain cases such as an Initial public offering (IPO) or the sale of the company. In Britain, Series A equity funding will typically be structured by the issuance of preference shares, redeemable shares, redeemable preference shares, ordinary shares (possibly split into different classes, for instance A ordinary shares and B ordinary shares), or some combination thereof. Series A rounds are traditionally a critical stage in the funding of new companies. Series A investors typically purchase 10% to 30% of the company. The capital raised during a series A is usually intended to capitalize the company for 6 months to 2 years as it develops its products, performs initial marketing and branding, hires its initial employees, and otherwise undertakes early stage business operations. Sources of capital  Because there are no public exchanges listing their securities, private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways, including warm referrals from the investors' trusted sources and other business contacts; investor conferences and demo days where companies pitch directly to investor groups. As equity crowdfunding becomes more established, startups are increasingly raising part of their Series A round online using platforms such as Onevest or SeedInvest in the US and Seedrs in the UK. These blended rounds include a mix of angel investors, strategic investors and customers alongside the offline venture capital investors. Structure  Smaller investment amounts are usually not worth the legal and financial expense, the burden on a company of adjusting its capital structure to serve new investors, and the analysis and due diligence on the part of institutional investors. A company that needs money for operations but is not yet ready for venture capital will typically seek angel capital. Larger amounts are usually unwarranted given the cost of business in fields such as software, data services, telecommunications, and so on. However, there are routinely series A rounds in excess of $10 million in fields such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and real estate development. Series A rounds in the United States venture capital community, particularly in Silicon Valley, are widely reported in business press, blogs, industry reports, and other media that cover the technology industry. Series A rounds also occur in non-technology industries and receive investment from investment banks, corporate investors, angel investors, public agencies, and others, that receive less press coverage than technology startup funding rounds. They all share a similar legal and financial framework, but specific terminology, deal terms, and investment practices vary according to business customs within different countries, business sectors, investor communities, and geographical regions.

Gy√∂rgy Beifeld was a 40-year-old Hungarian Jew in 1942. He lived in Budapest, where he was trained as a lawyer, but earned his living as a stockbroker. He was also a talented artist who loved to draw and paint in his spare time. In the spring of 1942, Beifeld was one of 50,000 Jewish men who were deployed in the Hungarian Labor Service (Munkaszolg√°lat) in the Soviet Union to support Hungarian troops sent to the eastern front to help the Axis to conquer the Soviet Union. In the labor service Living conditions were abysmal in the labor service, and the Jewish conscripts were often brutally mistreated by their officers and guards. The abuses against them included withholding or stealing their meager rations, denying them adequate clothing or footwear to perform their duties, quartering them for long periods outside without shelter, and dousing them with water and leaving them to freeze in the bitter cold of the Russian winter. During the retreat of the Hungarian army and its auxiliary labor units in the winter of 1943 after their defeat by the Soviets, Hungarian soldiers often plundered and even killed many of the Jewish labor servicemen. In all, more than 40,000 Jewish labor servicemen lost their lives. Beifeld was inducted into the 109/13 labor company in April 1942. The Jewish conscript took with him an ample supply of paper, paint, and pencils to keep him occupied in whatever spare time he could find. As it turned out, not only did these art supplies give him something to do in that spare time, they actually helped to spare his life during his year in the Soviet Union. Beifeld began painting immediately after his induction, creating watercolors of the base camp in Hungary where the company was initially stationed. On 20 April 1942, Beifeld's company departed by train for the Russian front. Just before their departure the members of the company received a superficial medical checkup and readiness review. As Beifeld writes in his memoir, > On April 19, Lieutenant Colonel Domonkos, Commander of the Replacement > Center, reviewed the Company's readiness to march. The only things he was > concerned about were the yellow armbands [the Jewish labor serviceman's only > uniform] and the dog tags. Were the yellow armbands properly sewn to the > jackets and overcoats, and did we have dog tags around our necks? Apart from > that, he was concerned only with the horses. He looked at us with deep > disgust. Later it came to our attention that he said goodbye to Banovich > [the company commander] with the hope that not a single Jew would be among > those whom he would bring back home Beifeld's company arrived at Orel in Russia on 26 April. He describes the countryside as seen from the train, noting not only the absence of young men, but also the absence of dogs, which increasingly had been used as a source of food in this time of privation. From Orel members of the company marched on foot for several days to their first destination, a construction site on the Orel-Kursk highway. Their task was to do maintenance work on the roadway. Beifeld describes the work as arduous and unproductive, and no sooner had they completed one task, they would receive another order to do just the opposite. Fortunately for Beifeld, after only 4‚Äì5 days of this hard labor his commander issued an order for the creation of a company diary, and Beifeld was asked to provide the illustrations. As a result, he was exempt for a time from construction work. Drawing and painting turned out to be a lucrative business for Beifeld. His portraits, landscapes, and caricatures became sought-after commodities, and many of the soldiers were ready to barter food or cigarettes for his pictures. During the summer of 1942, the company was sent on long marches that took them close to the front line. Their duties included building fortifications, transporting ammunition, constructing bridges and roads, laying mines, burying the dead, and carrying away the wounded. As the summer progressed the heat intensified, their rations were cut back, and their treatment deteriorated. The company was repeatedly the target of raids by the military police, who confiscated their meager personal belongings, including soap and cigarettes, which left them with nothing to barter for extra food. The conscripts hung on in the hopes of being demobilized at the end of the summer. Instead, they were sent back to the front line in September. In the course of their work many labor servicemen, including Beifeld, suffered shrapnel wounds. When his wound became seriously infected Beifeld was sent to a field hospital in Plotawa, 15‚Äì20 km behind the front line. There, he became friendly with the chief physician, Dr. Bela Balta. Counteroffensive and retreat The entire medical staff in the field hospital treated Beifeld with extraordinary care and respect and allowed him to remain for the full term of his convalescence. As soon as his hand began to improve, Beifeld started to draw and paint pictures of the hospital and its staff. Subsequently, he was entrusted with preparing the architectural drawings for a new field hospital. To forestall being sent back to his unit, Beifeld tried to make himself indispensable by taking up additional duties such as answering the phone, typing, and helping to transport the wounded. In his spare time, Beifeld wrote about the tough conditions faced by his labor battalion comrades during the Russian winter. Nearly half of his company's original 200 conscripts had either perished or were taken out of action with frostbite, malnutrition, and other ailments. On 13 January 1943, the new commander of the Soviet Army of the Don, General Georgy Zhukov, began a surprise counteroffensive that resulted in the destruction of the majority of the Second Hungarian Army and the retreat of the remainder to Kiev. Beifeld wrote pages of detailed and graphic descriptions of the chaotic evacuation in the snow under the bombardment of Russian planes. In one poignant description, he writes: > We started our Napoleonic-style retreat [which lasted from January 13 to > March 6] in snow that was 70 centimeters deep, in temperatures that reached > minus 46¬∞C. Running night after night in deep snow...Stumbling, sneaking, > sliding, holding on to the sled with both hands until they became stiff‚Ä¶This > is how one imagines a typical picture of retreat. Cars, horse-drawn wagons > carrying ammunition, tanks, small engines pulling cannons, yokes of oxen, > Russian sleds, total confusion‚Ä¶ The wind was blowing icicles into our eyes. > Our breath got frozen to the fabric we used to cover our faces. One's legs > were in great pain dragging the body‚Ä¶Anyone who got exhausted and sat down > for a minute would inevitably freeze to death. That applied equally to men > and horses. They lay there next to each other frozen to death, a soldier, a > horse, and a Jew. Despite all their suffering heretofore, the worst period for the Jewish conscripts in the Hungarian labor service came after their arrival in Kiev. There, they met up with the regular forces of the Hungarian army of occupation in the Ukraine, who ruthlessly persecuted them in their attempt to replenish their supply of war booty, which they had lost during the retreat. Beifeld managed to remain under the protection of Dr. Balta until the first week in April, when he was sent towards the Jewish reception camps dressed in a Hungarian military uniform with well-stocked bread bags and a laissez passer. He narrowly escaped capture by the military police, and looting and beatings at a collection center for Jewish conscripts in Pogoreloye. Eventually Beifeld met up with the remnants of his original company in a village called Vidinye. From here, he and his comrades were taken to another camp, where there was almost no food or water and where they were greeted with blows from the guards. Beifeld managed to maintain his health thanks to the assistance of a Hungarian first lieutenant, who gave him food every day in exchange for a couple of watercolors. This situation lasted for about three weeks, until 23 May, when a Hungarian general, after visiting the labor service personnel, ordered their evacuation. Within days the survivors, including Beifeld, were sent home by train. Knowing that his pictures had saved his life, Beifeld refused to abandon his artistic oeuvre during the long retreat, even though his comrades jettisoned or bartered everything they had in order to survive. Postwar assembling of the Beifeld album Beifeld did not have long to recuperate after his return to Budapest before the situation of Hungarian Jews took a dramatic turn for the worse. In March 1944, Germany occupied Hungary, and within weeks, the ghettoization and deportation of the Jewish community commenced. While a precise chronology of what happened to Beifeld in 1944 is not available, it is known that he was deported to a concentration camp (probably in the fall of that year) and was ultimately liberated in Dachau. Beifeld most likely assembled this album of original drawings and narrative text in the period between his return to Budapest in 1945 and his emigration to Australia either in 1948 or 1956. All but a few of the 400 images, which are carefully labeled as based on sketches drawn in situ, appear to have been created at the time of his labor service in the Soviet Union, and the text is based on notes he made at the time. Some of the drawings were made on the backs of military postcards that were mailed to friends and retrieved afterwards. Following his move to Australia, Beifeld changed his name to George Byfield and opened a tobacconist shop. Later he established a studio of interior design, which became quite successful. Beifeld died in Australia in 1982 at the age of 80. Due to a fluke, the album came to the notice and into the possession of an Australian historian, Ann Major, in 1999. Thanks to her tireless efforts (scanning most of the pictures and compiling an English summary of the text), the album was eventually sent to Washington It was another couple of years before the various beneficiaries of Beifeld's will came together to approve of the album's final home at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Humor in the Beifeld Album The uniqueness of the Beifeld album lies not only in its richness of illustration and detail of description, but in the charm of its author's sense of humor, which is displayed on nearly every page. Beifeld found himself caught in the bitterly ironic situation of being a Jewish conscript in one antisemitic army (Hungary) fighting against another antisemitic regime (Stalinist Russia) at the behest of a third, genocidal power (Nazi Germany). To cope with the awful absurdity of his situation, Beifeld resorted to a biting, sardonic form of literary and artistic expression. The humor is expressed through tongue in cheek descriptions, double entendres, sarcastic anecdotes and shocking juxtapositions in his drawings and collages.

He is currently employed as a TV commentator. His son Alessandro \\"Alex\\" Fiorio became a professional rally driver. Biography Cesare Fiorio was born in Turin, Italy, the son of Sandro Fiorio, former chief of the public relations department of Lancia. He began racing with Fiat, winning the Italian GT championship in 1961, and was eliminated from his only Monte Carlo Rally as the result of an accident. He obtained a degree in political science. Soon afterwards, in February 1963, he joined the Lancia management and established a racing team which he called HF Squadra Corse, which would become one of the most successful rally teams. Lancia was initially not keen on racing, and Fiorio wanted to change this attitude: he started preparing some Lancia Flavias, which entered many local rallies, obtaining some victories. In 1965, the team became a semi-works operation, and began hiring talented engineers to improve the Flavias; finally, in 1967, Ove Andersson won the Spanish Rally and Sandro Munari won the Tour de Corse. In 1969, the team was moved to the Lancia factory to become its official motorsport department; that year the team won the European title with Harry Kallstrom, beating other manufacturers such as Alpine, Ford and Porsche. Soon afterwards, Fiat bought the Lancia company, but Fiorio was left at the head of the team. In 1972 Munari won the Monte Carlo Rally and the team won the International Championship for Manufacturers; the following year Munari won the European Rally Championship title. Fiorio then began to push Lancia to develop the new Stratos and managed to get a supply of Dino engines from Ferrari. The car proved to be successful and Lancia won the 1974, 1975 and 1976 World Rally Championship manufacturers' titles. At the same time, Fiorio was an active powerboat racer, winning 31 races, six European and two World titles in his classes.. Lancia was also involved in sportscar racing since 1979 with the Monte Carlo model, followed by the LC1 and LC2 prototypes; Lancia won the World Championship for Makes in 1981 and the program continued until 1985. In 1980 Lancia even discussed building a turbocharged F1 engine for the Toleman team. but nothing came of this; rallying then remained the focus with the Lancia 037 model, which won the World Championship in 1983, followed by the Delta S4. In 1984 Fiorio was appointed head of the sporting activities of Fiat, and got a place on the board of directors of Juventus F.C. in 1987. When Fiat bought Alfa Romeo in 1988, he was appointed head of Squadra Corse Alfa Romeo, the racing department of this marque. In 1989 he debuted as sporting director of Ferrari, with the hard task of making the team competitive again after some disappointing seasons in the mid-1980s.; the team won the first race in Brazil with Nigel Mansell, and then again in Hungary and in Portugal, but poor reliability prevented the team from competing with McLaren and Williams. In Ferrari employed the reigning World Champion Alain Prost, and almost won the title, losing it in Japan with the second of the infamous Prost-Senna collisions. Fiorio was sacked by Ferrari weeks before the beginning of the 1991 season, but only left after the team‚Ä≤s troubles at the 1991 Monaco Grand Prix. In 1994 he returned to Formula One as team manager of Ligier, then owned by Flavio Briatore, but he was released the following year when Tom Walkinshaw took over the team. He was briefly involved with the Forti team in 1996 until its demise mid-season, and then returned to Ligier and remained there until the team was taken over by Prost and became Prost Grand Prix. At the end of 1998 he joined Minardi as sporting director and he remained there until the middle of 2000 when he resigned after a disagreement with team owner Gabriele Rumi. In 1994, Fiorio was appointed Cavaliere della Repubblica Italiana. He is currently employed by the Italian TV station RAI. Nowadays Fiorio owns Camarda Farm which is located between Ostuni and Ceglie Messapica's old town centres in the province of Brindisi.\\"How to find us\\", Masseria Camarda Retrieved 8 September 2016 The farm produces, for example, extra virgin olive oil, \\"primitivo\\" wine, corn, vegetables, cheese, fruit and eggs from the farm's own hens.\\"The farm\\", Masseria Camarda Retrieved 8 September 2016 In 2017, Fiorio suffered a bad cycling crash which left him in critical condition and he was hospitalized.

It is a dramaturgical technique that was pioneered by Bertolt Brecht, a twentieth-century German theatre practitioner . Fabel should not be confused with 'fable', which is a form of short narrative (hence the retention of the original German spelling in its adoption into English usage). Elizabeth Wright argues that it is \\"a term of art which cannot be adequately translated\\".Wright, Elizabeth. 1989. Postmodern Brecht: A Re-Presentation. Critics of the Twentieth Century Ser. London and New York: Routledge. . p.28. A critical term As a critical term, a fabel includes three interrelated but distinct aspects: firstly, an analysis of the events portrayed in the story. In an epic production, this analysis would focus on the social interactions between the characters and the causality of their behaviour from a historical materialist perspective; the fabel summarizes \\"the moral of the story not in a merely ethical sense, but also in a socio-political one\\". For example, in relation to Brecht's play Man Equals Man (1926), Wright argues that \\"[t]he fabel of this play centres on the transformation of an individual through his insertion into a collective.\\"Wright, Elizabeth. 1989. Postmodern Brecht: A Re-Presentation. Critics of the Twentieth Century Ser. London and New York: Routledge. . p.33 Secondly, a fabel analyzes the plot from a formal and semiotic perspective. This includes the play's dramatic structure and its formal shaping of the events portrayed. It also includes an analysis of the semiotic fabric of the play, recognizing that it \\"does not simply correspond to actual events in the collective life of human beings, but consists of invented happenings [and that t]he stage figures are not simple representations of living persons, but invented and shaped in response to ideas.\\" Thirdly, a fabel analyzes the attitudes that the play appears to embody and articulate (in the sense of the author's, the characters' and, eventually, the company's). Brecht refers to this aspect of a play as its Gestus. Analyzing a play in this way presupposes Brecht's recognition that every play encodes such attitudes; \\"for art to be 'unpolitical'\\", he argued in his \\"Short Organum for the Theatre\\" (1949), \\"means only to ally itself with the 'ruling' group\\".Brecht, Bertolt. 1949. \\"A Short Organum for the Theatre\\". In John Willett, ed. Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic. London: Methuen, 1964. . p.196. A practical tool As a practical tool, fabels form part of the process of engaging with a play-text undertaken by a company when mounting a production of a play. A fabel is a piece of creative writing, usually made by a dramaturg or the director, that summarizes the plot of a play in such a way as to emphasize the production's interpretation of that play-text. It is produced in order to make clear the company's particular way of understanding and rendering the story. In this respect, it is related to the concept of Gestus (insofar as this renders an action and an attitude towards that action simultaneously); a fabel indicates the sequence of gestic episodes that constitute the dramatic or theatrical narrative. Carl Weber, who worked as a director with Brecht at his Berliner Ensemble, explains that: > \\"[w]hat he [Brecht] called fabel was the plot of the play told as a sequence > of interactions, describing each event in the dialectic fashion developed by > Hegel, Marx and, in Brecht‚Äôs last years, also by Mao. This may sound quite > theoretical, but in Brecht‚Äôs practice the fabel was something utterly > concrete and practical. Acting, music, the visual elements of the staging, > in short, everything an audience perceived, had to contribute to the > storytelling and make it lucid, convincing, entertaining and ‚Äòelegant‚Äô--as > Brecht liked to put it. One result was that the Ensemble‚Äôs productions were > quite well understood by international audiences who could not follow the > German text. Brecht insisted that the configuration and movement of actors > and objects on stage should clearly ‚Äòtell the fabel‚Äô. If they were to watch > a play through a glass wall blocking all sound, the audience should still be > able to follow the essential story. He also insisted that each of the > performance elements: acting, design, music and so forth, should remain a > recognisable separate entity while it contributed to the fabel‚Äôs > presentation. Brecht liked to speak of a 'storytelling arrangement', which > meant the specific blocking of actors and all props employed in a scene. He > regarded this arrangement as the most important means to achieve a clear > presentation of the fabel, and the term 'scenic writing' may best convey > what he was aiming for. [. . .] The thorough and extremely detailed > preparation included countless discussions in which a text was dissected to > determine which fabel it might yield.\\"Weber, Carl. 1994. ‚ÄúBrecht and the > Berliner Ensemble - the making of a model.‚Äù In Peter Thomson and Glendyr > Sacks, eds. The Cambridge Companion to Brecht. Cambridge Companions to > Literature Ser. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . p.181, 183 As Weber's reference here to 'scenic writing' suggests, a director or other company member may produce multiple fabels during the course of a production, each detailing and clarifying a different aspect of the process: a dramatic analysis; an interpretive proposal; an initial springboard position from which to initiate a process of exploration and experiment in rehearsals; a description of individual production aspects (the lighting fabel, the sound Fabel, the visual or scenic design fabel, etc.); an account of progress made at different stages of the rehearsal process; individual actor performance and character behaviour fabels. Virtually any aspect of the theatrical process of production may be explored through the use of a specific fabel. John Willett, Brecht's English translator, suggests that: > \\"[t]he primary principle which [Brecht] taught his collaborators was that of > the fabel or story. The chain of events must be clearly and strongly > established not just in the production, but beforehand in the actual play. > Where it was not clear it was up to the ‚ÄòDramaturg‚Äô to alter the text, in > order to cut unnecessary entanglements and come to the point. The play > itself might be by Farquhar or Gerhart Hauptmann, Lenz or Moli√®re, but ‚Äòthe > writer‚Äôs words are only sacred insofar as they are true‚Äô. This went for > Brecht‚Äôs own words as well, and his plays were subject to continual small > changes even in the course of a single run. Atmosphere and ‚Äòpsychology‚Äô did > not matter as such; everything would emerge given a clear and credible > sequence of concrete events. ‚ÄòEach scene,‚Äô says a writer in Theaterarbeit, > ::is subdivided into a succession of episodes. Brecht produces as though > each of these little episodes could be taken out of the play and performed > on its own. They are meticulously realized, down to the smallest detail. The > chain of events had become his substitute for the tidy, comprehensive > ‚Äòplot‚Äô. Thus the \\"Short Organum\\": ::As we cannot invite the public to fling > itself into the story as if it were a river, and let itself be swept vaguely > to and fro, the individual events have to be knotted together in such a way > that the knots are easily seen. The events must not succeed one another > indistinguishably but must give us a chance to interpose our judgment. > ‚ÄòPlaying according to the sense‚Äô, the Ensemble calls it; and the sense is > what Brecht tried to get clear in any play, first for himself and his > collaborators, then for the audience too.Hence, for example, his emphasis on > that side of Shakespeare‚Äôs work which is so often neglected: the actual > story. ‚ÄòIt is a long time,‚Äô he found, ‚Äòsince our theatre played these scenes > for the events contained in them; they are played only for the outbursts of > temperament which the events allow.‚Äô [. . . ] In such conferences Brecht > would get his colleagues to make a written or verbal pr√©cis of the play, and > later they would have to write descriptions of an actual performance. Both > were practice in distilling the incidents that count.Willett, John. 1959. > The Theatre of Bertolt Brecht: A Study from Eight Aspects. Rev. Ed. London: > Methuen, 1977. . p.152-153,154) A fabel specifies, narrativizes, and objectifies the attitudes and activities involved in the process of producing a play. In doing so, it enables company members to dialecticize that process‚Äîin the sense that a particular fabel provides a fixed 'snapshot' of a transitory and constantly developing process in a form that enables comparisons to be made. These comparisons may be between the description in the Fabel and the reality of the production as it stands or between different fabels (which have been generated by the production either at different stages of the process or in relation to different aspects‚Äîlighting, sound, blocking, etc.---of it); for example, having produced a Fabel at the beginning of the rehearsal process, the director may return to it near the end of rehearsals to check that the production is 'telling the story' intended (or, alternatively, to clarify the ways in which that story has changed as a result of rehearsal exploration and development). The use of fabels does not predetermine the style of production nor does it necessarily require an epic dramaturgy or aesthetic (the elimination of suspense and mystery,Benjamin, Walter. 1939. \\"What is Epic Theatre? [Second Version]\\". In Understanding Brecht. Trans. Anna Bostock. London: Verso, 1973. . p.17: \\"[T]he suspense concerns less the ending than the separate events\\". defamiliarization effects, etc.), despite having originated in Brechtian practice. The creation of Fabels is an attempt to achieve clarity for the producers (actors, director, designers) rather than the audience (which would characterize an epic production). One may create psychological (in a Stanislavskian approach) or metaphysical (in an Artaudian approach) fabels as well as the social ones that Brecht explored.

She had a novel diesel-electric machinery outfit designed to maximise range. She was armed with four 120 mm guns, two 40 mm guns, and two 13.2 mm machine guns. The ship also had an extensive engineering workshop on board and could provide repair support to Italian submarines based in East Africa. A modified sister ship to be called Etiopia was planned, but cancelled on the outbreak of war. Service Eritrea, 14 September 1943 entering Port of Colombo to surrender. Following Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940, colonial ship Eritrea became part of the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina). Eritrea was part of the Italian Navy's Red Sea Flotilla located at the port of Massawa in Eritrea.History of the \\"Eritrea\\" (in Italian) In February 1941, as the East African Campaign started to go badly for the Italians, Massawa, the home port for Eritrea became more endangered. Along with and , Eritrea slipped through a British blockade off Perim and sailed into the Indian Ocean on 20 February 1941.Eritrea dangerous travel to Asia (in Italian) She sailed across the Indian Ocean and ultimately reached Kobe, Japan. Upon reaching Japan, Eritrea was supposed to operate as a commerce raider in the Pacific Ocean. Even though allied with Italy, the authorities of then neutral Japan took a dim view of the idea of an Italian raider operating from neutral Japanese ports. The Japanese refused to comply with the Italian plans and Eritrea was not allowed to leave Kobe. In December 1941, after the official declaration of war, the Japanese government allowed Eritrea to provide assistance to \\"transport submarines.\\" These submarines, carrying rare goods, arrived in Japanese-held Penang and Singapore from the distant bases in German-held Bordeaux. On 8 September 1943, when Italy declared an armistice, Eritrea was navigating between Singapore and Sabang to give a support to the Italian oceanic cargo submarine . The submarine had just arrived from occupied France after a long and difficult voyage. As soon as the Reuters message about the surrender of Italy was picked up by the crew of Eritrea, the vessel changed course at once and headed at full speed to Colombo in Ceylon to surrender. Eritrea passed by Sumatra and escaped despite the presence of the Japanese aerial and naval units. Off the coast of Ceylon, it was intercepted by HMS Overdale Wyke of the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force. Eritrea identified its self and its intent to surrender. It was boarded by a party from HMS Overdale Wyke and escorted to the Port of Colombo. It was later used by the Royal Navy from Colombo and Addu Atol. French service After the war, Eritrea was turned over to France. The French Navy used Eritrea in colonial service with the name Francis Garnier until 1965. Francis Garnier was then declassed to become a target ship. She was sunk during a nuclear test in the Pacific Ocean in 1966.

FM 1325 was designated on July 14, 1949 from US 81(now IH-35) to SH 29(now US 183). The segment between I-35 and proposed SH 45 was redesignated as part of State Highway 45 on August 25, 2003.  Route description  FM 1325 has three main segments. The first begins at an intersection with US 183 in north Austin. Here, FM 1325 is named Burnet Road (pronounced burn-it) and is a four-lane controlled roadway. It proceeds north to an intersection with Loop 1 (Mopac Expressway). At this point, FM 1325 joins Loop 1 and continues north for as a limited-access highway. North of FM 734 (Parmer Lane), the main lanes of Mopac Expressway become a limited-access toll road. The frontage road here uses the FM 1325 and Loop 1 designations. This concurrency continues for to Merrilltown Road. North of Merilltown Road, FM 1325 is once again named Burnet Road and is a four-lane controlled roadway. It continues north for to its northern terminus at SH 45 in Round Rock.

It is the earliest known preschool series to be produced in the United States, predating Romper Room by a year. The program was presented from a child's point of view. A 1953 magazine article reported, \\"Low-angled cameras see everything at Lilliputian eye-level, stories and activities are paced at the slow rate just right for small ears and hands.\\" Each program began with Miss Frances ringing a hand-held school bell. A precursor to Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, the show was hosted live by Frances Horwich (aka \\"Miss Frances\\"), and at one point was the most popular TV series aimed at preschoolers. The program began in 1952 at Chicago's WNBQ television. After six weeks on the air locally, the program was picked up by the NBC television network. At the height of its popularity, Ding Dong School had three million viewers. Origins The idea for the program came from a conversation between WNBQ's program director and the director of public service and educational programming Judith Waller. The program director told Waller there were more than 235,000 preschool children in the Chicago area, then he asked her what she planned to do about it. A team was formed to explore the possibilities of educational television programming to serve this young market. It was decided to produce a nursery school program in which a teacher on television would instruct students watching at home. The team also designed the show to be viewed from the standpoint of a small child. Camera shots would be taken from this vantage point and any props used would need to be items easily recognized by young children. After the format of the program was determined, the next step was to find the right person to host the show. A list of educators who were possible candidates was compiled, and those on the list were invited to audition for the program. One of the educators on the list was Frances Horwich, who was head of the education department at Chicago's Roosevelt College. Horwich was an experienced nursery school teacher, but her only experience in television had been when participating in televised panel and discussion programs. Since there would be no class of children in the television studio, the person hosting the show would be alone on the set and on camera. The thought of this was somewhat frightening to Horwich, but she auditioned and won the job. She was willing to give the program a try. The program was named by producer Reinhard Werrenrath's three-year-old son, Peter. When he was told that a ringing school bell would begin each program, he began calling it Ding Dong School. Going on the air Many local NBC executives who were watching the show's development and its rehearsals, were very skeptical about its chances for television survival. The station's general manager viewed the program as either the worst or best television program he had ever seen; another executive thought the show would bring an end to television broadcasting and revive radio programs. Since those in charge believed the program was a mistake, it was decided to air it only once. The show was scheduled to be aired in the morning of October 2, 1952 and the station deliberately issued no publicity releases regarding it. Since the executives at WNBQ held that the program had no future, no one was prepared for the 150 telephone calls in support of the show which were received immediately after it aired. These calls were followed by a large amount of positive viewer mail. The amount of positive viewer response was such that the executives reversed their decision and quickly made room in their weekday morning schedule for Ding Dong School. With the program now scheduled to be aired every weekday morning, Horwich had two weeks to master the art of drawing, painting and doing puzzles upside-down for the television camera. The program =NBC Chicago Horwich as Miss Frances, began each show by ringing a hand-held school bell and singing the Ding Dong School song. She then looked directly into the camera and asked, \\"How are you this morning?\\" Just as she would in a classroom, Horwich paused a while to allow her class to answer the question. The entire program was conducted as if there was a live class of children on the television set. Activities ranged from finger painting, making toys with pipe cleaners, modeling clay or drawing. Lessons on things like safety when crossing streets were also presented. Many children drew pictures and sent them to Miss Frances; these drawings were displayed and discussed. Before the end of each program, Horwich would ask the children at home to bring mother to the television set. She would then recap what lessons and activities were covered that day and what supplies were needed for future programs. Despite the fact that it had aired for a short time, the program won a George Foster Peabody Award for 1952. The show was popular enough locally that it became a weekday network program in early 1953. Within two months of joining the network, Ding Dong School had 2,400,000 daily viewers. It was also beating Arthur Godfrey's morning television program in the ratings. Horwich owned the rights to the program and also received certain rights through her contract with NBC. The program attracted many sponsors and Horwich had the right of refusal of them. She refused sponsors whose products had any connection with violence and insisted advertised products had to be items used by children. Other requests came from companies hoping to produce Ding Dong School licensed merchandise such as coloring books and crayons. Horwich insisted licensed items would not be expensive and would be educational. There were 25 books written by Horwich, 11 Ding Dong School records and 30 companies selling licensed items by 1956. A Ding Dong School PTA was organized so Horwich and parents could share their views. NBC New York In 1954, Horwich became Head of Children's Programming for the NBC television network. She moved to New York in early 1955 and Ding Dong School was then broadcast from there. She remained in this position until 1956 when Ding Dong School was canceled; replacing it would be The Price Is Right. Horwich had previously refused a network request to expand Ding Dong School from 30 minutes to a one- hour daily program. as she felt young children should not watch television for more than a half-hour at a time. NBC also wanted to move the program from mornings to either late morning or early afternoon; this request was also refused by Horwich. Horwich was asked to accept commercials from a sponsor who made BB guns. When she refused, she was told Ding Dong School would be canceled. When the program was canceled, Horwich resigned from her network position, but NBC refused to accept her resignation. Ding Dong School again After being canceled by NBC, the program remained off the air until Horwich returned to Chicago and signed an agreement with WGN-TV to air the show locally beginning in 1958. Because Horwich owned the rights to Ding Dong School, she was able to have the program on the air in Chicago and to syndicate the program through a California company beginning in 1959. The program was syndicated until 1965. Five NBC kinescoped episodes from 1954-1955 are housed at the Library of Congress, in the J. Fred and Leslie W. MacDonald Collection.

The screenplay by Robert Getchell is the third feature film adaptation of the 1923 novel Stella Dallas by Olive Higgins Prouty. Previous film versions were Stella Dallas (1937) and the silent film Stella Dallas (1925). The title character is a vulgar and unfashionable single mother living in Watertown, NY, who, determined to give her daughter Jenny all the opportunities she never had, ultimately makes a selfless sacrifice to ensure her happiness. This film version differs from earlier versions in that Stella never marries the father of her child, and in fact, declines his proposal early in the film. John Erman directed a cast that included Bette Midler as Stella and Trini Alvarado as Jenny, with John Goodman, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason, Eileen Brennan, Linda Hart, Ben Stiller, and William McNamara in supporting roles. Plot Stella (Bette Midler) is a feisty woman working in a bar when she meets and falls for the suave charms of the young Dr. Steve Dallas (Stephen Collins). Although from opposite ends of the social spectrum, they start an affair resulting in Stella becoming pregnant. After he proposes half-heartedly, she rejects him and embarks upon raising their child Jenny as a single mother but is always helped and encouraged by her stalwart friend, a local good natured barfly, Ed Munn (John Goodman). Stella is fiercely independent and proud and is determined to do well by this child and take on whatever jobs she must to raise her daughter properly. When Jenny is 4 years old, her father suddenly reappears on the scene and is determined to get to know his daughter. At first reluctant to allow this, Stella is persuaded to allow contact, and a happy bond develops between the father and daughter. As Jenny (Trini Alvarado) grows up, she becomes torn between her father's rich and well-connected background, and her loyalty and love for her mother who is poor and vulgar but devoted to her daughter. She also despises the perceived relationship she sees developing between Stella and Ed Munn who is now a broken alcoholic. Jenny eventually meets and falls for a boy from her fathers 'world' and Stella realizes that now, the disparities in her own and Jennys father's backgrounds might jeopardize her daughter's future happiness. Cast *Bette Midler as Stella Claire *John Goodman as Ed Munn *Trini Alvarado as Jenny Claire **Ashley Peldon as Jenny (age 3) **Alisan Porter as Jenny (age 8) *Stephen Collins as Stephen Dallas *Marsha Mason as Janice Morrison *Eileen Brennan as Mrs. Wilkerson *Linda Hart as Debbie Whitman *Ben Stiller as Jim Uptegrove *William McNamara as Pat Robbins Reception The film received mediocre reviews. Peter Rainer quipped in his Los Angeles Times review, \\"Do we really need to be put through another version of 'Stella Dallas'? Is this the vehicle that Bette Midler thinks will reclaim her serious-actress status? If so, she's greatly misunderstood her gifts, which stand in raucous, subversive contrast to everything this sudsy weepie represents. Directed by John Erman, freighted with a musical score of soaring banality, this 20-year saga of an uneducated, working-class single mother who sacrifices everything to give her daughter the chance she never had is so recklessly shameless it verges on camp parody.\\" In The Washington Post, critic Rita Kempley stated: \\"From bathhouse chanteuse to Lemon Joy diva, from self- proclaimed queen of camp, sass and tactlessness to goddess of suds, sap and pap -- yes, you have come a long way, Baby Divine. Gone is the Bette Midler of \\"Clams on the Half Shell\\" and 'Ruthless People,' the better Midler, and in her place is this new middling piddler.\\" In her New York Times review, Janet Maslin said, \\"Bette Midler, too old for the film's opening and too smart for its resolution, isn't exactly the right actress, but she's a lot closer than might have been expected. Ms. Midler manages to gloss over the story's inconsistencies, play up its charming aspects, and generally bluster her way through . . . her exuberance is most helpful in overshadowing the inconvenient aspects of this story.\\" A far more positive review came from critic Roger Ebert who wrote that \\"Stella is the kind of movie that works you over and leaves you feeling good, unless you absolutely steel yourself against it. Go to sneer. Stay to weep.\\" Razzie Award nominations went to Midler for Worst Actress and Jay Gruska and Paul Gordon for Worst Original Song (\\"One More Cheer\\"). Box office Stella debuted at No.2. Total US gross for the film was $20,062,347.http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1990/0STEL.php Home media The film was issued on VHS on Touchstone Home Video (Cat. #995) on August 29, 1990 and proved more successful on home video.

Thompson was a graduate of Yale University. Early life Thompson was born in New Jersey in 1922. He began his political career before America's entry into World War II when he campaigned against involvement as a member of the German American Bund and the America First Committee. In this role, he came to the attention of Nazi Germany and was appointed as a Special Agent of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) Overseas Intelligence Unit on July 27, 1941. After the war, Thompson returned to Yale University in 1946 and completed his studies before embarking on an expedition to Antarctica. This was as part of Operation Highjump under the command of Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd. He would soon befriend Otto Skorzeny and worked alongside him in setting up ODESSA. Alongside his political activities, Thompson also found work in public relations and this remained his area of employment. He died in 2002. Post-war activism Thompson became a close ally of Otto Ernst Remer and in 1951 when he registered with the United States Department of Justice as the American representative for the Socialist Reich Party, a position he held until the group was banned in 1952. Around the same time, he also became involved with the National Renaissance Party.'The Ties that Bind' from the Southern Poverty Law Center site His political involvement brought him into contact with Francis Parker Yockey while both men were campaigning for Remer's release from prison during the 1950s. Thompson and Yockey remained close allies until the latter's death in 1960. Thompson definitely stated his position by writing an article entitled 'I Am an American Fascist' for Expos√© magazine in 1954. In the article he praised the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler and condemned the Nuremberg Trials as 'vicious and vilely dishonorable'. As a result of this, he became linked to the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics and published a number of pamphlets on their behalf. International ties Seeking to expand international contacts, Thompson visited Cairo in an attempt to forge links with the Nasser regime. More concrete links were established with Mohammad Amin al-Husayni and Johann von Leers as part of a wider policy of building up contact with the Islamic world. Republican Party and later work Along with a number of right wing activists Thompson was also involved on the fringes of the Republican Party. Independently wealthy, he contributed to the campaigns of such right wing figures in the GOP as Jesse Helms, Oliver North and Pat Buchanan. His monetary contributions to the party were such that he was awarded membership of their Presidential Legion of Merit as a result. In his later years, Thompson largely disappeared from public view. In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing he re- emerged, initially welcoming the attack; afterward, however, he later revised his position and denounced it as a government act designed to destroy the reputation of the far right. Writing Thompson's involvement in writing dated back to his early post-war years, whilst he also worked as a publisher and literary agent (where his clients have included Fulgencio Batista, Carol II of Romania and Hans-Ulrich Rudel). Alongside this he has since become a writer for Journal of Historical Review, his articles including Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz: Last President of a United Germany. A subsequent book D√∂nitz at Nuremberg: A Re-Appraisal was also edited by Thompson. Thompson was offered a position on the board of policy of the Liberty Lobby, although he turned it down stating that he only wanted to take one loyalty oath in his life (to Hitler when he joined the SD).

It consists of a virtual galaxy with over a million stars and solar systems that can be explored using a 2-dimensional map. Each star, each planet and each moon represents one wiki page, the idea behind the project is that Galaxiki site members, also called Galaxicians, can edit those pages and write fictional histories about them. Galaxiki's name is a portmanteau of the words galaxy and wiki (a type of collaborative website). The Galaxiki rules say that real world physics should be respected, but it also allows some popular exceptions known from most science fiction novels, such as traveling faster than light or using paranormal powers for example. This also implies that species inside the Galaxiki world can meet (at least if their solar systems are in a closer range), which is a challenge for Galaxicians as they have to make sure to eliminate inconsistencies. Science fiction stories on Galaxiki are published by default under the GNU Free Documentation License. Galaxiki membership, editing solar systems and using all other site features is free. To finance the project, solar systems can be \\"freed\\", which means that Galaxicians can make solar systems writable by making a small donation to the project. It is also possible to \\"purchase\\" individual solar systems to make their related wiki pages read-only for all other site members. There is a dedicated page for sponsors or advertisers too, but the project itself states that there shall be only an absolute minimum of advertising. Most solar systems are currently still locked, but new solar systems are open automatically for the community every day. When a Galaxician \\"frees\\" a solar system he/she can decide if the system shall become open for the entire community, or if the system shall become a private project. In this case it is also possible to dedicate the star or solar system to someone. Galaxiki was launched as a prototype on March 12, 2007, it was officially launched on July 1, 2007. It was Linux Journal's \\".org site of the week\\" on July 11, 2007, listed under \\"best websites in August 2007\\" on about.com on August 3, it was Yahoo's \\"Pick of the Day\\" on August 27 and it was one of the SEOmoz \\"Web 2.0 awards\\" winners in 2008. In 2010 Galaxiki 2.0 was released, turning the site into a social network and introducing over 100 new features and enhancements. It now has over 5000 registered users (\\"Galaxicians\\") and there are more than 12000 solar systems open for the community or registered by individual users.  Software and hardware  The Galaxiki software is based on the CorneliOS virtual web OS and web application framework, a software project which is run by Galaxiki's creator Jos Kirps. CorneliOS is available as open-source software under the GNU General Public License, although the extension made for the Galaxiki project is closed source. Both CorneliOS and the extra Galaxiki code are written in Perl and make use of the Apache HTTP Server, Galaxiki's wiki runs on a MySQL database.

His most productive years were in the minors with the Clinton Comets where he had back-to-back 100-point seasons. Personal Born in North Bay, Ontario, Lalande returned each summer during his hockey career. After his hockey career, Lalande returned to North Bay permanently. In North Bay, he coached local hockey and baseball teams. He organized and coached sledge hockey for disabled athletes. Lalande was inducted into the North Bay Sports Hall of Fame in 1986. Professional career=Minor league hockey Lalande started out playing for the Belleville Bulls and Galt Black Hawks of the Ontario Hockey League Junior. He showed great promise as a playmaker and was quickly recognized by NHL scouts. In the middle of the 1953‚Äì54 season, Lalande was called up by Galt's parent team the Chicago Black Hawks to play two games. He did not record a point but received two penalty minutes. He was sent back down to finish the season in Galt. The following season Lalande was again brought up to a higher league, this time with the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League. He played three games but again failed to really impress and was returned to Galt. He finished out the season leading his team in points with 31 goals and 48 assists, putting him fifth in the league overall for points and fourth in the league in assists. He had finally caught the attention of Chicago and was brought up to play a permanent role with the Black Hawks for the 1955‚Äì56 season. Playing in the NHL Lalande played 65 games for Chicago that season and recorded 26 points. He would continue that pace the following season while playing with linemates Forbes Kennedy and Harry Watson. He also saw time with affiliate the Rochester Americans in 1956.

In 12 games with the Red Wings, Lalande put up only two assists and was traded, four months after coming from Chicago, to the Hershey Bears of the AHL along with Don Poile and cash for Dunc Fisher on April 23, 1958. The trade would turn out to be a blessing in disguise as Lalande would help lead the Bears to back-to- back Calder Cup Championships in 1957‚Äì58 and 1958‚Äì59. Lalande remained with the Bears for three more seasons, helping them to again reach the finals in 1960‚Äì61, eventually falling four games to none to the Springfield Indians. Lalande also played a single game for the Montreal Royals of the Eastern Professional Hockey League in a rehab stint in 1961.

Playing in only 26 games, Lalande scored 30 points and 57 PIMs. For the 1963‚Äì64 season, Lalande joined the Clinton Comets of the Eastern Hockey League and put up his most impressive numbers to date.

In post-war communist Poland, Blaichman was the head of the Prison and Camps Department at the Security Office in Kielce. Shortly after the war he emigrated to the United States. Blaichman‚Äôs portrayal of his activities in communist resistance and security have been questioned and have given rise to several controversies in Poland. The Holocaust Frank Blaichman was born in Kamionka, Poland in December 1922. His grandmother owned a grocery store and his father was a grain merchant. He was 16 years old at the time of the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. Although German officials issued decrees that limited Jewish travel outside of Kamionka and required Jews to identify themselves by wearing armbands, Blaichman took a number of risks in order to help his parents and six brothers and sisters. He rode his bicycle from the neighboring farms and villages to Lubart√≥w (six miles east) and Lublin (12 miles south) where he bought and sold goods such as honey, chickens, butters, grains, meat, tobacco, yarns, and sugar. Blaichman was able to travel among the population without being recognized as a Jew (he refused to wear the Star of David armband and traveled without the necessary permits). He was assigned to work two days a week on a nearby estate with crops, but instead he paid someone to fill his place and continued to engage in underground trading. In October 1942, the Kamionka Jewish council (Judenrat) informed the Jewish residents that they would be resettled in the Lubart√≥w Ghetto. Blaichman slipped out of Kamionka and went to a gentile farmer in the village of Kierzk√≥wka who offered him assistance (the family of Aleksander and Stanis≈Çawa G≈Ços, which would later be listed among the Polish Righteous Among the Nations). He later learned that the Jews of Kamionka had not been relocated to the Lubart√≥w Ghetto but rather were deported on trains to an unknown destination. Blaichman heard that a group of Jews were hiding in the forest, so after two days with the farmer, he made his way to the forest and found more than one hundred Jews living in an encampment of small bunkers in the forest. He realized that the group was in constant danger. Blaichman encouraged the group to form a defense unit to guard the camp even though they had no firearms. In December 1942 the group managed to acquire firearms from a local Polish farmer. (However, according to another biography, it was only in summer of 1943 that Blaichman left the G≈Ços family and joined the resistance). In late January Blaichman and some of his fellow Jewish partisans received shelter from Polish farmer Boles≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski; however the Germans raided their shelter and many Jews were killed, alongside with DƒÖbrowski who was executed by Germans shortly afterward. Five decades later, in 1994, the Yad Vashem Institute posthumously awarded Boles≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski the title of Righteous Among the Nations. Over time, Blaichman's unit increased in size. They were joined by refugees from Markuszow and expanded to sixty fighters. In the spring of 1943, Blaichman encountered Samuel Gruber. Gruber's group consisted of men who had fought in the Polish Army and knew how to use explosives and mines. The two groups joined together and became a more effective fighting force. By September 1943, the communist People's Army realized that the Blaichman and Gruber groups could be a dependable ally in the fight against the Germans and provided them with supplies that had been parachuted in by the Soviet air force. Now equipped with hand grenades, explosives, land mines, machine guns, and ammunition, the group could be even more successful in fighting the Germans. In 1944, Blaichman's group received an order from the People's Army to move east and join forces with another Jewish partisan unit in the Parczew area commanded by Yechiel Grynszpan. Gruber was appointed deputy commander and Blaichman, at the age of 21, became the unit's youngest platoon commander. In July 1944, the Soviet Red Army advanced from the east and entered the Parczew forest. Also that month, Lublin was taken from the Germans by the Soviets, and Blaichman's partisan group entered the city. Near the end of the war and immediately afterward (April to 19 July 1945) he has worked for the Polish communist secret police (Office of Public Security), as the temporary head of the Department of Prisons and Camps (Wydzia≈Ç Wiƒôzie≈Ñ i Oboz√≥w) in the Kielce's Voivode Office of Public Security (Wojew√≥dzki UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Pa≈Ñstwowego, WUBP). Franciszek Blajchman at the \\"Twarze kieleckiej bezpieki\\" exhibition. The short bio note, accompanied by a photo, reads: \\"Franciszek Blajchman, son of Chaim, born 11 December 1922, temporary head of the Department of Prisons and Camps (WUBP) in Kielce - from c. April to 19 July 1945\\" After the war, Blaichman married Cesia Pomeranc, who had also lived in the Parczew area, and six years later they settled in the United States; Blaichman found work as a builder in New York. Blaichman published a memoir in November 2009, Rather Die Fighting: A Memoir of World War II. In August 2010, a Polish translation, Wolƒô zginƒÖƒá walczƒÖc. Wspomnienia z II wojny ≈õwiatowej, was released in Poland. The book has been described as controversial in Poland, where it has led to a number of controversies. He died in Manhattan on 27 December 2018, aged 96. Controversy Following the publication of his memoir in Poland, some parts of his account, particularly related to his and his unit interactions with the Home Army, have proven to be controversial. Stanis≈Çaw Aronson, a former Polish-Jewish officer of the AK, called the charges made in the book against the Home Army \\"absurd\\", a view which has been endorsed by historians Jan ≈ªaryn and . In turn, Blaichman portrayal of his activities in communist resistance has been questioned, and it has been alleged that he was a member of a criminal gang associated with communist Gwardia Ludowa which focused on forcefully obtaining provisions from the local populace and clashed with the Polish resistance. Perhaps most controversially, Blaichman also mentions that at one point he shot dead two AK soldiers, which has led to demands for this case to be investigated by the authorities. The spokesman for the Polish Institute of National Remembrance has declared that Blaichman's book will be investigated to determine whether he is guilty of communist crimes. The case was described as still open as of February 2019. In 2019 the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, praised Blaichman in his speech in Poland as an exemplary \\"Polish survivor who settled in the USA and achieved an American dream\\", which was described by Polish press as a political blunder, given Blaichman's controversial association with the communist security apparatus.

It comprises various video games created by Nintendo, starring the character Wario. The franchise began with Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, the first game to feature Wario as a playable character.

Its gameplay consists of platforming through levels, tossing enemies, breaking blocks and using other abilities. Wario Land characters * was designed as an antagonist to Mario, and first appeared in the 1992 handheld video game Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins as the main villain and final boss. Since that time, Wario has developed into the protagonist and antihero of his own video game franchise spanning both handheld and console markets, in addition to his numerous appearances in spin-offs of the Mario series. He is voiced by Charles Martinet, who also voices the Mario, Luigi, and Waluigi characters. Wario and Waluigi seem to have been named with respect to the Japanese word warui [ÊÇ™„ÅÑ], meaning \\"bad\\" or \\"evil\\".

The Pirates' base of operations is Kitchen Island, a gigantic coved island in the middle of the ocean, and their main mode of transportation is the S.S. Teacup, a massive pirate ship. She acts as Wario's ally in Wario Land: Shake It! to have him do all of the work for her, however she betrays him in the end and steals his treasure. *Rudy the Clown is the main antagonist of Wario Land 3. Rudy lures Wario into the music box world, claiming that he is the god of the world. He convinces Wario to help break the seal that was placed upon him by the other creatures of the world, with the promise of keeping any treasure Wario finds. After the seal is broken, Rudy reveals himself and attacks Wario. Wario defeats him, and the curse on the other inhabitants is broken. Rudy returns in the video game Dr. Mario 64, where he and Mad Scienstein concoct a plan to steal the Megavitamins from Dr. Mario because he has a cold, and wants the power to cure any illness. *Golden Diva is the main antagonist of Wario Land 4. She is responsible for taking over the golden pyramid that was originally ruled by Princess Shokora whom she placed a curse upon turning her into a black cat. Wario decides to explore the pyramid after reading about its legend in an article. She is not encountered until later in the game when the player gains access to the innermost chamber of the pyramid where various treasures are being kept. *Princess Shokora appears in Wario Land 4. In the game's manual, it is mentioned that she was the original owner of the golden pyramid where the game takes place in, but was cursed by the Golden Diva. In her cursed form, Shokora is capable of shapeshifting, her most common forms being a tiny black cat and a black stick figure. For a price, Wario can get her help in boss fights by inflicting damage on the boss before the fight begins. After Wario recovers her belongings from the pyramid's bosses and destroys the Golden Diva, Shokora is released from the curse and thanks Wario for saving her (though her appearance and Wario's reaction changes based on how many other treasures Wario obtained from the bosses), then is escorted by angels into the heavens. *The Shake King is the main antagonist of Wario Land: Shake It! who kidnaps Queen Merelda and takes the Shake Dimension's treasures, among them the Bottomless Coin Bag that holds an infinite number of coins. Sweet- talked by Captain Syrup with promises of treasure, Wario defeats the Shake King and frees the Shake Dimension from his evil, though this registers as a complete afterthought in Wario's mind. *Queen Merelda appears in Wario Land: Shake It! as the ruler of the Shake Dimension. She is captured by the Shake King in the game's beginning. After being rescued by Wario, Merelda gives him her gratitude, but Wario throws her aside and takes the Bottomless Coin Bag, only for Syrup to steal it from him due to a deal that Merfle made with her. *Merfle appears in Wario Land: Shake It!. She is a small fairy-like creature who helps Wario enter and leave the Shake Dimension. Many of her friends (all of them the same species as Merfle) are captured by the Shake King, and Wario must save them in addition to recovering treasures. At the end of the game, Captain Syrup steals the Bottomless Coin Bag from Wario and Merfle explains that it was already promised to her. This sends Wario into a rage as he chases Merfle through his garage. Wario: Master of Disguise characters *Count Cannoli is the original star of the television show The Silver Zephyr, in which he is the titular thief. A master of disguise, Cannoli uses his magic wand Goodstyle to change his appearance, but Wario leaps into the television world of the show and steals Goodstyle out of jealousy. Over the course of the game, Cannoli chases Wario demanding Goodstyle back and is a frequent obstacle as he sets traps and attacks Wario in his mechanical Mad Hat vehicle. *Goodstyle is a sentient magic wand that grants its wearer the power to change their appearance. He has been passed down through the Cannoli family for many generations, but Wario steals him from the current-day Count Cannoli and uses him to become his own alter-ego \\"The Purple Wind\\". Goodstyle accepts Wario as his new master and teaches him how to use his power. After Wario defeats Terrormisu, Goodstyle reveals his true form as the very first member of the Cannoli Clan and the one who originally banished Terrormisu. He thanks Wario for his help and gives him all the accumulated wealth of the Cannoli Clan as gratitude. However, Wario discovers that he can't take the treasure out of the television world, leaving him both penniless and furious. *Carpaccio is a rival thief to Count Cannoli. He owns a corporation called Sigil Securities and can transform into a giant blue ball with a face on it. He initially does not think much of Wario, but quickly realizes that \\"The Purple Wind\\" is more than he appears. At one point, Carpaccio teams with Count Cannoli to stop Wario from reassembling the Wishstone, a magical relic that supposedly can grant any wish. *Tiaramisu is a blonde woman in a pink dress who first appears to Wario on Sweatmore Peak and helps him briefly during his search for the Wishstone. After Wario fully reassembles the Wishstone, she reveals her true identity as the demon Terrormisu, the main antagonist of the game who had been sealed away in the Wishstone by the first of the Cannoli Clan and had been manipulating Wario to reassemble it so she can return and cause disaster. She is ultimately defeated by Wario and runs back into the underworld crying, never to return. WarioWare series WarioWare (also Wario Ware), known in Japan as , is a series of games featuring the Nintendo character Wario. The franchise was established in 2003 with the release of Mega Microgame$! for the Game Boy Advance. While the first two games were developed by Nintendo R&D1;, subsequent games have been co-developed by Intelligent Systems. The distinctive feature of all WarioWare games is that they are collections of short, simple \\"microgames\\" presented in quick succession. Each of these microgames lasts about three to five seconds and must be completed, or else a life will be lost. For example, there is a microgame where the player must zap a spaceship; in another, Wario must collect coins in a Pac-Man-like maze. The numerous microgames are linked together randomly and steadily increase in speed and difficulty as the player progresses. On each level, players are allowed four losses only. After a certain amount of microgames have been played, the player faces a stage-specific boss microgame; the player must complete these to regain a lost life (with a maximum of four). Boss microgames are considerably longer and more complex than other microgames. For example, a boss microgame in Mega Microgames! instructs the player to hit a nail with a hammer multiple times in a row. The idea of microgame or minigame was popularized generally during the Nintendo 64's fifth generation of video game consoles and some early minigames appear in the Nintendo 64DD's Mario Artist: Talent Studio in the style that would give rise to the WarioWare series. Certain minigames literally originated in Mario Artist: Polygon Studio, as explained by Goro Abe of Nintendo R&D1;'s so-called Wario Ware All-Star Team: \\"In Polygon Studio you could create 3D models and animate them in the game, but there was also a side game included inside. In this game you would have to play short games that came one after another. This is where the idea for Wario Ware came from.\\" Teammate Yoshio Sakamoto continued, \\"To add on that, we got the idea of using Wario and the other characters because we couldn't think of anyone else who would be best for the role. Wario is always doing stupid things and is really idiotic, so we thought him and the rest of the characters would be best for the game.\\" Game & Wario, released in 2013, is a spinoff of the WarioWare series. The latest installment in the series, entitled WarioWare Gold, was announced during a Nintendo Direct presentation on March 8, 2018, and released worldwide later that year. WarioWare gamesMicrogames Microgames are simple video games created by the fictional company WarioWare, Inc.. Nintendo's line of WarioWare games each feature these microgames, which are generally less than 5 seconds long. Microgames are even simpler and shorter than the minigames found in other games such as the Mario Party series. Gameplay in all WarioWare games is distinct from most other games, as they involve the player or players trying to beat the microgames as soon as possible. Most games present instructions in the form of a verb and quickly drop the player into the situation where they must perform said verb. The extremely stripped-down gameplay has intrigued some game researchers, who have used WarioWare both as a case study in understanding the relationship between rules and play in videogames, and as a target domain for investigating automated game design. All microgames are strung together in a random order within different \\"stages\\", each hosted by a different character. First, the player is presented with a quick one or two word instruction such as \\"Eat!\\" or \\"Rub!\\" Then, the microgame will appear and the player will have to complete the game according to the instruction. Microgames usually have only one task to complete. For example, in one microgame the player is told to \\"Enter!\\" and is presented with a scene from The Legend of Zelda. The player must use the directional buttons to move Link to a cave entrance before the time runs out. In another microgame, the player is told to \\"Avoid!\\" and must drive a car, avoiding oncoming traffic. Most microgames have a sound bite that signifies when the task is completed. Boss microgames always occur at a set point in a stage. They are usually more challenging than regular microgames, have no time limit (as described below), and give lives back upon completion. If a stage is played for the first time, it is completed after the boss microgame. The sound bite will usually play after the task is fulfilled, and then the score screen will return. On repeated plays, if the player has less than four lives, one will be restored. Some microgames, most commonly IQ-genre microgames, last twice as long as normal microgames. These microgames usually involve memory or observation puzzles. An example of a double-length microgame is one from Gold, in which the player must find the correct car in a parking lot. Certain microgames require a complete lack of input to complete. These include a microgame in Twisted! and Gold that instructs \\"Don't move!\\" to keep eggs balanced upright, or a Microphone microgame in Touched! and Gold instructing the player to stay quiet as several Fronks cross a tight rope. The unit of time for all microgames is beats. In Mega Microgames! and Twisted!, a standard microgame is 8 beats, double-length microgames (usually IQ-genre games) last 16 beats; Fronk's microgames in Twisted! and Gold only last 4 beats. In most games, the BPM will start out relatively slow and will increase as the player completes microgames. In WarioWare: Touched!, the 8-beat standard has been dropped for all microgames, so many last longer than 8 beats. This may be a difficulty curve for those unaccustomed to the Nintendo DS's touch-screen interface. To retain pace, the microgames will automatically end if cleared before a four-beat measure is met. To show the time left to complete a microgame, a small \\"bomb\\" appears at the bottom of the screen. The fuse and a countdown timer show the amount of time left to complete the microgame. When time runs out, the bomb explodes and in most cases, the player loses a life. The fuse burns faster when the BPM increases. Some microgames are intrinsically harder than others, and an increased BPM (increased speed) will make any microgame more difficult to complete than the same microgame at a slower BPM. This is usually reflected in the microgames' \\"clear scores\\"‚Äîthe score one must reach while playing a microgame in the practice modes to obtain credit for \\"clearing\\" it. (Smooth Moves and D.I.Y. lack this feature.) Each microgame features three difficulty levels: Blue, Yellow and Red. Blue presents the given task in an easier way, while Red presents it in a much harder way. Not all modes of all WarioWare games actually show a color to denote the current level, but most modes start with Blue games, progressing to Yellow upon a \\"Level Up\\" (usually achieved after passing a boss microgame), then to Red in similar fashion. Once Red is reached, sequential \\"Level Up\\"s will typically be replaced by \\"Speed Up\\"s (an increase in BPM). Using the above The Legend of Zelda microgame as an example, the Blue version of this microgame usually places Link very close to the cave entrance that he must enter. The Yellow version places the entrance further away and places an enemy that blocks Link, and the Red version places the entrance yet further, and has a second enemy that shoots at Link from a lake. Linked by Nintendo? WarioWare characters There are two major types of character in the WarioWare series. The first are the WarioWare, Inc. developers, who both create and host the microgames. Each one has a unique theme or twist, depending on the game. For instance, Jimmy T.'s microgames in Twisted! are focused around large spins, while in Touched! his microgames involve rubbing objects with the stylus. The second group of characters often show up within the introduction cutscenes ‚Äî the most notable being Fronk, who hosts \\"Pop-Up\\" microgames in Twisted! and Gold and pops up in the most unlikely of places. =Major characters= * is 9-Volt's mother and makes a few appearances in the WarioWare games. She is never fully seen until Game & Wario, and is a human like her son. 5-Volt lives along with her son and his pet Fronk in a house in Diamond City. She makes her first appearance in WarioWare: Twisted!, where she shouts at 9-Volt to go to bed since he was playing with 18-Volt all day. 5-Volt is seen only from behind, and from the knees down. After 9-Volt has gone to bed, he still furtively plays with his Game Boy Advance SP under the bedspread, but his mother catches him when she opens his room's door a second time. 5-Volt's silhouette is seen in the doorway. 5-Volt is seen again in WarioWare: Touched!, as a silhouette in the Game Over screen of 9-Volt and 18-Volt's stage. She watches her son and his friend eating cake. In Game and Wario, she has a more major role as the main obstacle in the ‚ÄúGamer‚Äù minigame. In Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, she appears as a stage hazard in the Gamer stage. She appears again in WarioWare Gold with her own microgames that are all based on Nintendo games, just like 9-Volt's and 18-Volt's. She is voiced by Cristina Vee in Gold. * is a young Nintendo fanatic, owning everything ever made by Nintendo. 9-Volt's microgames are all based on Nintendo games. He is voiced by Melissa Hutchison in Gold. * is 9-Volt's best friend, and is also a fan of video games. He is large, but despite his size, he goes to Diamond Elementary School, as does 9-Volt. His other defining trait is the boom box he always carries; his loud music gets him into trouble on his first day of school, although he soon finds an admirer in 9-Volt. He is voiced by Edward Bosco in Gold. * is a witch in training, who lives in a mansion in Diamond City with a little demon named Red. She has long black hair in two long ponytails, she's very emotionless and rarely smiles. She is largely uninterested in activities unrelated to improving her witchcraft; such tasks are typically relegated to Red. Ashley makes a cameo appearance in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as an Assist Trophy character. Ashley also appears in Super Mario Maker as an unlockable Mystery Mushroom costume. Ashley reprised her role as an Assist Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Ashley is voiced by Erica Lindbeck in Gold, while Red is voiced by Tyler Shamy. * and are two developers who speak with Bronx accents. They also work as cabbies, and their cab, which was designed by Dr. Crygor, has the ability to go anywhere. Dribble is a large anthropomorphic bulldog with red hair. He is large, burly, and seems gruff, but he is actually quite calm and friendly. Spitz is a yellow anthropomorphic cat. He is always squinting and wears goggles. Their levels generally involve picking up a weird customer and forgetting to ask for the fare. Dribble is voiced by Kyle Hebert in Gold, while Spitz is voiced by Griffin Puatu. * is a quirky scientist whose inventions include his cryogenic suit, Mike, the karaoke robot that would \\"solve all his cleaning needs\\", the Super MakerMatic 21, and the Kelerometer diet machine. One of the character card descriptions in WarioWare Gold states that he is over 100 years old. He is the grandfather of Penny Crygor. In WarioWare: Touched, Dr. Crygor accidentally gets caught in his latest invention and is younger and more fit, with red accents to his costume, as well as a full helmet. These changes remain for a part of WarioWare: Smooth Moves. He is voiced by Kyle Hebert in Gold. *The are a strange, blocky, yellow species of creatures. They appear constantly throughout all the WarioWare games, both in microgames and cutscenes. 9-Volt apparently even keeps one of them as a pet, calling it \\"Shag.\\" In addition to several varieties of yellow Fronk, there are also red and blue varieties; their faces vary individually from each other. 9-Volt's pet Fronk is voiced by Todd Haberkorn in Gold. * is a man with a large blue afro wig, who is a disco dancing fanatic. Jimmy is always seen frequenting hot Diamond City night spots, particularly Club Sugar. His family, which also dances with him includes Papa T. and Mama T., and his brother and sister, James T. and Jamie T. He also has a doppelganger named Jimmy P. whose hair is a different color to his. Their levels often involve remixing the games from previous stages. He is voiced by Vegas Trip in Gold. * and are kindergarten-aged ninja twins. Kat has pink hair with a single ponytail, while Ana has orange hair with two ponytails. Ana is timid, while Kat is more headstrong and overall the dominant sister, though she cares for Ana deeply. The two live in an old-fashioned Japanese-style house in a forest. The two are descended from the Iga ninja clan, and attend Mystical Ninja Elementary. They have four pets: Don the Sparrow, Shadow the Dog, Shuriken the Falcon, and Nunchuck the Monkey. Kat & Ana make a cameo appearance in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as Assist Trophy characters and regular trophies. It should also be noted that combining their names results in the word \\"Katana\\", one of Kat & Ana's catchphrases. Kat is voiced by Stephanie Sheh in Gold, while Ana was voiced by Fryda Wolff. * is a karaoke robot made by Dr. Crygor. Despite being a robot built for karaoke, the slightly mad doctor programs him to be a cleaning robot. Eventually, Mike overrides his cleaning program with his karaoke program by blowing on a pile of dust. He is voiced by Robbie Daymond in Gold. * is a high school student with a different part-time job in each game. Mona is quite adventurous, cheerful and culturally savvy. She always seems to be late to wherever she is going, often speeds on her scooter to make up for lost time, and uses the assistance of her animal companions to stop anyone trying to slow her down. Her former occupations include working at a gelato shop, pizza delivery girl on Mona Pizza, bassist, football cheerleader, and a temple explorer. Also, Mona has a crush on Wario. She is voiced by Stephanie Sheh in Gold. * is an intelligent alien. He has an IQ of 300. The instruction manual for WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$! and WarioWare Gold both imply that Orbulon was born in the year 0. Orbulon first wishes to conquer Earth, but after crash-landing on the planet, he settles into life on Earth and ends his mission of conquest. He is voiced by Robbie Daymond in Gold. * is the granddaughter of Dr. Crygor and dreams of becoming a great scientist. Her stage in WarioWare Gold reveals that she also has a hidden desire to become a singer. Penny sees her grandfather as an excellent scientist, though she also recognizes his eccentric nature. She is voiced by Fryda Wolff in Gold. * is a character that has his own game in almost every WarioWare title, each one varying in style. The original Pyoro game is Wario's inspiration to found WarioWare, Inc.. Pyoro resembles a round red bird with a white belly, short wings, and a very stretchy tongue. Pyoro 2 (from the GBA version) is the only game where Pyoro is yellow with a tail. Pyoro also appears as a title character in Bird & Beans, the DSi re-release. * is first introduced in WarioWare: Smooth Moves. He has flowing black hair with white streaks and a blue outfit. He practices martial arts and trains with his master, Master Mantis, and the two of them travel all over looking for new forms. Young Cricket is voiced by Robbie Daymond in Gold, while Master Mantis is voiced by Owen Thomas. =Minor characters= *13-Amp is a female teenager who appears in 18-Volt's stage from WarioWare Gold. She steals a kid's video games, but 18-Volt gives them back after beating 13-Amp in a rap battle. 13-Amp is voiced by Cristina Vee. *4.1 and 4.2 are Mona's two wolflike pets who made their first appearance in WarioWare: Touched! (2004). 4.1 and 4.2 only appear during Mona's story. When Vanessa sics The Dinosaurs, other members of her band, in their hawk-like plane on Mona when she travels to the Hawt House, they steal Art, a member of Mona's band, from her van. Pizza Joe comes in, along with her three other animals, to reclaim him. Unfortunately, Mona's animals fail miserably. Joe then distracts The Dinosaurs long enough for 4.1 and 4.2 to come in and use their soccer ball launcher on the Dinosaurs plane. Sadly, even they were unable to save Art from the Dinosaurs. 4.1 and 4.2 have not been seen since. *Doris 1 is a robot who appears in WarioWare Gold that was created by Dr. Crygor before Mike. While on an expedition in Agate Forest, they encounter her and Doris 1 chases Dr. Crygor for abandoning her. After that, they take her back to Dr. Crygor's Lab, where she is forgiven. *Bridget the Baker is the owner of the Sweet Spot Bakery that Wario visits in the game WarioWare: Touched! (2004). After the dentist Dr. Payne told Wario to stay away from all sweets, (since he got a cavity from eating too many sweets) he left the Dental Clinic and picked up the scent from the bakery. Ignoring what the dentist said, Wario asked Bridget the Baker to give him 10 pies. After a few bites Wario got another cavity and the pain sent him all the way to the Dental Clinic. While he flew away, Bridget bid him goodbye with a friendly \\"Thank you, come again.\\" *Dark Lord Hum Gree is a demon who appears in WarioWare Gold who makes a monster very hungry. According to Red, he is never satisfied, mean and breathes fire. After being defeated by Ashley, he changes into a different person. His name is a play on the word \\"hungry\\". *Joe is an anthropomorphic beagle who made his first appearance in WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames! (2004). He usually appears alongside Mona, often as a co-worker. Like Mona, he has several occupations throughout the series, such as a gelato shop worker and clothing store owner. He is voiced by Kyle Hebert in Gold. *Lulu is a young girl who made her appearance in WarioWare Gold, coming from an isolated town called Luxeville. Despite her age, she is very smart and brave, considering how she's able to battle Wario Deluxe. She seems to view herself as a hero of sorts, as supported by her saying \\"Lulu...the greatest hero ever..\\" in her sleep during one of the cutscenes. She is voiced by Alex Cazares. *Vanessa is a pop singer from WarioWare: Touched!, her main appearance being as the antagonist of Mona's story, Cute Cuts. *Sal Out is Diamond City's popular singer who made her first appearance in WarioWare: Twisted! (2004). She appears during Mona's storyline as the singer for Mona Pizza's commercial. *Amy and Mimi are two girls who first appeared in WarioWare Gold. They both enjoy cute animals and taking photos of them, as evidenced from their character cards, and in the Jimmy T. level. Other games Wario has starred in puzzle games such as Mario & Wario and Wario's Woods (the latter of which he was featured as the main antagonist while Toad took the role as the main hero), as well as crossing over into the Bomberman universe with Wario Blast: Featuring Bomberman! (1994). Appearances in other games Wario is a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, his default outfit being his motorcyclist outfit as seen in the WarioWare games, although he can also wear his classic overalls. He can transform into Wario-Man after obtaining a Smash Ball. His motorcycle is used as one of his special attacks. Kat and Ana also make appearances as an Assist Trophy. Many stickers also represent WarioWare, Inc. ‚Äî in addition to all of the above appearing as stickers and trophies, there are stickers of other WarioWare characters. Also, there is a WarioWare stage, named WarioWare, Inc., based on the Variety Tower location from WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames! with several different microgames that run in the background, one of which features Jimmy T. Completing the tasks set by the games awards power-ups like invincibility or growth. This stage also features Ashley's Song, Mike's Theme and Mona Pizza's Song as background music. All three are featured in Japanese and English. Wario is once again playable in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, however he now appears as unlockable, instead of being available from the start as in the previous game. The 3DS version retains the WarioWare, Inc. stage from Brawl, while the Wii U version has a stage based on the Gamer sub- game in Game & Wario. Ashley, another character from WarioWare, is also included as an Assist Trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and a downloadable Mii costume in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The Alien Bunnies from Orbulon's stage in Mega Microgame$ make an appearance in Rhythm Tengoku, a game developed by the same team, and also make brief appearances in its sequel, Rhythm Heaven. A later sequel, Rhythm Heaven Megamix features two unlockable challenges called \\"Wario...Where?\\" that remix several of the minigames to feature characters from the WarioWare series.

He was sired by Sovereign Dancer, who in turn was a son of 1964 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Northern Dancer out of the mare On To Royalty.  Early racing career  Trained by Nick Zito, he had four starts at age two in 1995 and won two races while placing second in the other two starts. In the late summer, Louis Quatorze came in second in the seven-furlong Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga Race Course to Hennessy. In mid-September 1995, he finished second in the seven-furlong Futurity Stakes at Belmont Park to Maria's Mon. During the winter, he was freshened for a long time and didn't come back to the track until March. At age three, Louis Quatorze won an allowance race at Gulfstream Park in March, giving Zito enough confidence in him to take on stakes winners in a graded race. In April 1996, Louis Quatorze shipped to Keeneland Race Course and raced in the grade two $700,000 Blue Grass Stakes, where he placed second in a field of seven. He was beaten only by eventual Eclipse Award champion Skip Away. All three of the top finishers in the Blue Grass moved on to Louisville on the first Saturday of May and competed in the Kentucky Derby. In the Derby itself, Louis Quatorze broke badly and got caught in traffic early, running in twelfth position. He finished sixteenth of nineteen.  Preakness Stakes  Zito and his owners, William J. Condren and Georgia E. Hofmann, believed there was a legitimate reason for Louis Quatorze's loss in the Derby, so they entered him in the Preakness Stakes on the third Saturday in May 1996 at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. In the race, Zito and jockey Pat Day had a specific plan to take Louis Quatorze to the lead and see if he could settle or slow the pace. At post time, Louis Quatorze went off as the fifth choice at 9‚Äì1 in the field of twelve stakes winners. He broke from gate six and shot straight to the lead and angled to the middle of the track away from the rail to avoid traffic. Day thought the pace was moderate, setting fractions of :23 flat and :46-1/5 for the first quarter and half. Near the end of the back stretch, he led Skip Away, Victory Speech and the rest of the field in a record 1:09-4/5 for three quarters of a mile. At the top of the stretch, second favorite Skip Away made a run at Louis Quatorze, closing to within a length. Louis Quatorze pulled away to win in the time of 1:53-2/5, which was thought to equal the stakes record at the time until Secretariat was belatedly recognized with the record of 1:53. The track record of 1:52-2/5 belongs to Farma Way. Skip Away finished 3 1/4 lengths back in second, three lengths in front of Belmont winner Editor's Note and Derby runner-up Cavonnier.  Later racing career  Later that year, Louis Quatorze won the Jim Dandy Stakes, came in second in the Travers Stakes and ran third in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. In November, he placed second to Alphabet Soup in the Breeder's Cup Classic, defeating Cigar, who came in third. Retirement Louis Quatorze stood at Murmur Farm in Darlington, Maryland until his passing on the morning of February 17, 2017. He was buried at that farm. Among his offspring, he had sired graded stakes race winners Repent, Choctaw Nation, and Bushfire.

It was the result of opposition between groups of citizens, fighting over the constitution of the city or social and economic problems.Berger: Revolution and Society, p. 10. Staseis were endemic throughout the Greek world, in mainland Greece as well as the colonies of Magna Graecia. With 19 episodes of civil strife between 650 and 214 BC, Syracuse, in Sicily, was the city with the most recorded staseis.Berger: Revolution and Society, p. 34. Berger records 72 staseis for all the cities of Magna Graecia. The Aristeuein-ideal According to the Iliad, the goal of all men of honour in archaic Greece was to always be the first and superior to the others.Iliad 6, 208. This ideal was called the aristeuein- or aristeia-Ideal. In Homer's days, this ideal was mainly based on performance skills in speaking and fighting, and included wisdom, self- restraint, loyalty, and bravery (e.g., leading armies in the front row). For decades, prestige, which was a requisite for might, originated in speaking ability and military virtues. This is true for the cases of both Solon and Peisistratos by Herodotus1,60 and by Aristotle in the Athenaion Politeia.2.1 In addition, success at the Olympic Games, especially in the field of four- horse chariot racing, was a peaceful way to gain prestige.Herodotus (5, 71 ) mentions this when introducing Kylon The resulting civil wars Since ancient Athens before Solon did not have a fixed state order or instruments of power that belonged only to the state, the aristocrats could compete violently for office and property.Alcaeus writes about 600 BC: \\"Money is the man\\", while both Hesiod and Solon mention aristocrats ruthlessly trying to enlarge their wealth during the 7th century BC As a result, as methods became more and more violent, aristocrats and their oikoi (families and followers) were engaged in civil strife against each other. At the beginning of the 6th century, the situation worsened,Plutarch: Solon, 13, see also Athenaion Politeia: 5,1 so that the aristocrats of Athens made Solon a lawmaker and arbitrator. The result was the Solonic Reforms. From then on, the term tyrannos (tyrant) became increasingly connected with violence and lawless might, a development which was fruitful only after the death of Solon's successor, the tyrannos Peisistratos. Stasis under Peisistratos After Solon's retirement from Athenian politics, the struggle for might continued, because the Athenian society wasn't ready for a fixed state order yet.Schlange-Sch√∂ningen, p. 32 Under Peisistratos' regime, the stasis continued, but only for charges under the tyrant, thus both securing him by appeasing the other aristocrats, and accustoming them to fixed charges given by a ruler, which paved the way for the reforms of Cleisthenes. Thus, aristocrats like Callias and Cimon had to struggle for prestige by winning in Olympia or showing off their wealth, not by becoming tyrants, while Miltiades the Elder emigrated from Athens and became head of a colony.Herodotus (6,34) ReferencesBibliography * Moshe Berent: Stasis, or the Greek invention of Politics.

The SS had established W√∂bbelin to house concentration camp prisoners whom the SS had evacuated from other camps to prevent their liberation by the Allies. At its height, W√∂bbelin held some 5,000 inmates, most of whom were suffering from starvation and disease. The camp was freed on May 2, 1945. History In September 1944 a small camp was built--called aerie of egret (German: Reiherhorst)-- for US prisoners of war. On 12 February 1945 a group of inmates were transported to build a larger camp, now called KZ W√∂bbelin. The SS- physician Alfred Trzebinski stated during his trial, that 648 people were held at W√∂bbelin camp until the end of March 1945. In mid-April several transports from subcamps of Neuengamme and Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp with more than 4,000 inmates arrived.Link to W√∂bbelin: On May 2, 1945, the 8th Infantry Division and the 82nd Airborne Division encountered W√∂bbelin. Living conditions in the camp when the U.S. 8th Infantry and the 82nd Airborne arrived were deplorable. There was little food or water and some prisoners had resorted to cannibalism. When the units arrived, they found about 1,000 inmates dead in the camp. In the aftermath, the U.S. Army ordered the townspeople in Ludwigslust to visit the camp and bury the dead. On May 7, 1945, the 82nd Airborne Division conducted funeral services for 200 inmates in the town of Ludwigslust. Attending the ceremony were citizens of Ludwigslust, captured German officers, and several hundred members of the airborne division. The U.S. Army chaplain at the service delivered a eulogy stating that: > \\"The crimes here committed in the name of the German people and by their > acquiescence were minor compared to those to be found in concentration camps > elsewhere in Germany. Here there were no gas chambers, no crematoria; these > men of Holland, Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and France were simply > allowed to starve to death. Within four miles of your comfortable homes > 4,000 men were forced to live like animals, deprived even of the food you > would give to your dogs. In three weeks 1,000 of these men were starved to > death; 800 of them were buried in pits in the nearby woods. These 200 who > lie before us in these graves were found piled four and five feet high in > one building and lying with the sick and dying in other buildings.\\" In accordance with a policy mandated by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, the U.S. Army in Ludwigslust ordered \\"all atrocity victims to be buried in a public place\\" with crosses placed at the graves of Christians and Stars of David on the Jewish graves, along with a stone monument to commemorate the dead.

One of the last Sega games to use TTL chips instead of a CPU, the game has players race against a clock and pass rival racers while attempting to earn points driving through five areas. An upgraded version, Pro Monaco GP, was released in 1980; the series also had later releases Super Monaco GP and Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II. Monaco GP was ported to the SG-1000 in 1983. The game was successful in arcades. Gameplay and technical aspects The deluxe cockpit cabinet of Monaco GP. Inside, a stick shift is on the left, and a steering wheel and pedal are underneath the monitor. Monaco GP was one of the last arcade games made by Sega to use TTL-based discrete logic circuits instead of a CPU. Over 100 chips across two circuit boards operate the game. Images such as the cars and \\"game over\\" message are stored in small custom ROM chips. Sound effects, such as the cars' engines, a siren, and the sound of wheels slipping on the pavement, are generated by operational amplifiers and other analog circuitry. The scoring information appears on various LEDs located on the cabinet, including the player's score and the high score table. The main objective of the game is to race against the clock. Points are awarded as the player races through five areas. As the game progresses, rival cars controlled by the game get faster, the road narrows, and the road surface changes to ice and gravel. Multiple styles of arcade cabinet exist for the game, including a deluxe cockpit cabinet which was designed in approximation to sitting behind the wheel of a race car with a padded steering wheel and accelerator pedal. Release and reception Initially displayed at the Japan Amusement Association show in Tokyo in 1979, Monaco GP received a positive reception at its debut. Sega chairman David Rosen called the game's warm reception at the show evidence of the world's growing acceptance of coin-operated arcade games. Monaco GP was released in November of 1979. An upgraded version, called Pro Monaco GP, was released in 1980, and the original game was later ported to the SG-1000 and SC-3000 in 1983. Sega later revived the Monaco GP series with Super Monaco GP in 1989, and Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II in 1992. Monaco GP's arcade version became highly successful. Cashbox labeled the game the most popular arcade driving game in the US in 1982. The game appeared on the monthly sales chart of RePlay magazine from April 1980 until April 1987, a record number of appearances to which Namco's Galaga was the next closest to reaching. Game Machine listed Monaco GP on their July 15, 1983 issue as being the fifth most-popular upright arcade unit in Japan at the time. French magazine Tilt gave the SC-3000 version of the game 6 of 6 stars in graphics, and 4 of 6 in gameplay. In 2003, Sega made a remake for the PlayStation 2, as a part of the Sega Ages 2500 collection. The remake features a number of additions including more cars and game modes. Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 applauded the 2500 remake in particular for its improvements to the gameplay of the original, believing it would have been worthy of a separate release outside Japan.

It is probably the best known of BhƒÅsa's works. The plot of the drama is drawn from the romantic narratives about the Vatsa king Udayana and Vasavadatta, the daughter of Pradyota, the ruler of Avanti, which were current in the poet's time and which seem to have captivated popular imagination. The main theme of the drama is the sorrow of Udayana for his queen Vasavadatta, believed by him to have perished in a fire, which was actually a rumour spread by Yaugandharayana, a minister of Udayana to compel his king to marry Padmavati, the daughter of the king of Magadha. It forms, in context, a continuation of his another drama, Pratijnayaugandharayana. The complete text of the Svapnavasavadattam was long lost until it was discovered in Kerala in 1912.A tradition is recorded that when the critics subjected the plays of Bhasa to a severe test by throwing them into fire, only Svapnavasavadattam rose out unaffected, while other plays were all consummated by the flames.

In 1939‚Äì1941 many Jewish refugees arrived in the town from western and central Poland which was attacked by Germany in the beginning of World War II. Soviet tanks rolled into Zdziƒôcio≈Ç in the evening of 18 September 1939. Police station was already abandoned by the Poles, with only papers scattered on the floor. Next morning, Mayor Henryk Poszwi≈Ñski was arrested by the NKVD along with school principals, so≈Çectwo council, gmina clerks and one priest, and taken to prison in Nowogr√≥dek never to be heard from again. In June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. The Jewish population of Zdziƒôcio≈Ç (Dziat≈Çava) had increased to more than 4,500 due to influx of refugees. First Jewish public school in Zdziƒôcio≈Ç founded in the Second Polish Republic during the Interbellum German forces occupied the town on 30 June 1941. On 14 July 1941, the German military commandant ordered that the Jews must wear the yellow badge on the front and back of their clothing under the threat of death. On 23 July, about 120 of the most respected citizens and members of the Jewish intelligentsia were selected from among the Jews and assembled in the square. The selection was carried out according to a list compiled by the collaborationist Belarusian Auxiliary Police (established on 7 July 1941) for the use by the SS Einsatzkommando killing squad arriving in Zdziƒôcio≈Ç. Among those arrested were Alter Dvoretsky (an attorney active in the Communist Poale Zion), the rabbi, and Jankel Kaplan. The local Jews bribed the Germans to attain the release of Dvoretsky and the rabbi. All the others were allegedly taken away for forced labor, but two days later it was discovered that they had been transported to the forest near the military barracks in Nowogr√≥dek and murdered there. German occupation (1941‚Äì1942) At the end of August 1941, Zdziƒôcio≈Ç was transferred to German civil administration and became part of the Nowogr√≥dek district (Gebietskommissariat). At this time the Judenrat Council was formed. Among its members were Alter Dvoretsky, Hirshl Benyamovitz, Jehuda Luski, Moshe Mendel Leizerovitz, Eli Novolenski, Dovid Senderovski, Faivel Epstein, Shaul Kaplinski, Rabbi Jitzhok Reicer and Berl Rabinovitz. Shmuel Kustin became the chairman of the Judenrat and Dvoretsky was the deputy chairman. Soon afterwards Dvoretsky replaced Kustin as head of the Judenrat. He was 37 and had obtained his education as a lawyer in Berlin and Warsaw. One of the main tasks of the Judenrat was to ensure that the German orders were strictly carried out. On the second day of the holiday of Sukkot, some Germans arrived in the town to requisition horses for the army. Many of the Jews had decided to hide, but the Germans caught one ‚Äì Ya'akov Noa ‚Äì and shot him without warning. On 28 November 1941 the Jews of Zdziƒôcio≈Ç were made to line up, and forced to surrender all their valuables. Libe Gercowski, accused of having hidden two gold rings, was shot in front of everyone. On that day the Judenrat was also obliged to select four glaziers and fifteen carpenters who were sent to an unknown destination. On 15 December 1941 some 400 men were sent to the labor camp in Dworzec to work on the construction of an aerodrome. This work was supervised by the Nazi Organisation Todt. Formation of the Ghetto On 22 February 1942 the authorities put up posters on the walls announcing that all Jews had to move into the new ghetto, which was set up around the synagogue and the Talmud Torah building within the streets of ≈Åysog√≥rska and S≈Çonimska. Over 4,500 Jews were ordered to relocate there. Between five and six families were forced to share houses vacated by non-Jews and many families had to split up. Eight or more people were put into each room, from which the furniture had been removed to be replaced by improvised bunk beds. Some of the families, like the Kaplans, prepared secret hiding places in the Ghetto, which helped them survive the later massacre. The ghetto was partly fenced by wood and barbed wire, and two local policemen guarded the gate. The Jews were not permitted to talk to other citizens and warned that they might be shot if they attempted to obtain food from the outside. Nevertheless, peasants still brought food to the ghetto and sold it for gold, clothes, and other necessities. Special work permits were issued to those who performed forced labor outside the ghetto. The Jews were guarded when marched out of the ghetto in columns. Resistance in Zhetel In autumn 1941, before the ghetto was set up, Alter Dvoretsky formed a Jewish underground organization in the town, consisting of about sixty people. Dvoretsky established links with the Jews living in the surrounding villages and also with a group of Red Army operatives, who were in the process of organizing Soviet partisan force in the area. His group was divided into twenty cells, each consisting of three men. They also obtained some weapons a month before the ghetto was established. About ten members of the underground joined the Jewish police. Upon moving into the ghetto the underground group headed by Dvoretsky had the following aims: first, to prepare an armed revolt in the event that the ghetto was going to be liquidated; second, to collect money to buy weapons and bring them into the ghetto; and third, to convince the non-Jewish population not to cooperate with the Germans. The group made contact with the leader of the Soviet partisans in the area, Nikolai Vakhonin. On 20 April 1942 Dvoretsky and six members of the ghetto underground were forced to escape to the forest after their organization became known to the Germans. Shortly afterwards Dvoretsky was killed in an ambush. A number of other Jews were hiding in the dense Lipiczansky forest (Las Lipicza≈Ñski) after fleeing from Zdziƒôcio≈Ç as well as from ≈ªo≈Çudek (Zheludok in Russian), Belica (Belitsa), Kozlowszczyna, Dworzec and Nowogr√≥dek. Their leaders were Pinya Green and Hirshel Kaplinski. Partisan resistance activities After a while a partisan detachment consisting of more than one hundred Jews was formed in the forest near Zdziƒôcio≈Ç. It was called the \\"Zhetler Battalion.\\" Everybody who wanted to join in had first to obtain a gun. The unit was divided into three platoons headed by Hershl Kaplinsky (Israel Kaplinski), Jonah Midvetsky, and Shalom Ogulnik respectively. The staff of the headquarters included two other members, Pinya Green and Shalom Gerling. There were also some women in the battalion, acting as nurses, cooks, secretaries, typists and washerwomen. A few of them also took part in combat activities. The unit's base was some twenty kilometers away from Zdziƒôcio≈Ç in the Lipicza≈Ñski (Lipichanski) forest. They accepted Jews from around Nowogr√≥dek, and coordinated all their activities with the Soviet partisans operating in the area, in particular with the Orlanski (\\"Borba\\") detachment under Nikolai Vakhonin, as well as, with the Lenin Brigade. The Lenin Brigade was subordinate to the Baranowicze Branch of the General Staff of the Soviet Partisan Movement of Belorussia under Soviet Major General Vasilii Chernyshev (Chernyshov), known as \\"Platon\\". \\"Platon\\" commanded more Soviet units locally including the Kirov Brigade under Sinichkin (and later, Vassiliev), who in turn gave orders to Bielski partisans. Tuvia Bielski said later about the Polish farmers: \\"Without them, we would not have survived the early times.\\" The Soviets attacked the railroad tracks on the Lida-Baranowicze, Baranowicze- Minsk and Wolkowysk-Bialystok lines. Yisrael Bousel invented a fast new sort of mine, which the Soviet partisans successfully used to derail German trains. He was posthumously awarded the honorary title of \\"Hero of the Soviet Union.\\" Liquidation of Zhetel Ghetto On 29 April 1942 the Germans arrested the Judenrat. At dawn on 30 April the ghetto inmates were woken by shots inside the ghetto. The Germans announced through the Judenrat that all the Jews were to go to the old cemetery, which was situated within the ghetto boundaries. At the same time the Germans and their collaborators began to drive the Jews out of their houses, beating, kicking, and shooting those who were reluctant to obey. A selection was then carried out: women, children, and the old were sent to the left, the young skilled workers to the right. About 1,200 of those sent to the right were marched along the streets to the Kurpiasz (Kurpyash) Forest on the southern edge of town, where some pits had been dug out in advance. There the Germans shot them in groups of twenty. During the course of the shooting the German district commissar appeared and released those who had a certificate stating their profession as well as their families. Thus about one hundred returned to the ghetto. The massacre was conducted by the German and local Belarusian Auxiliary Police forces. The second massacre started on 6 August 1942 and lasted for three days. Many Jews hid in prepared . During the course of the final liquidation of the ghetto some 2,000‚Äì3,000 Jews were executed into three mass graves in the Jewish cemetery on the southern outskirts of Zdziƒôcio≈Ç, roughly 1,000 people in each. Just over 200 Jewish craftsmen were transferred to the ghetto in Nowogr√≥dek. This was the end of the ghetto and the end of the Jewish community of Zdzieciol. Several hundred Jews including the Kaplan family, who had hidden, fled once the massacre was over, some forming a family camp in the Nakryshki forest, where they managed to survive until the liberation. Among the known victims of the 1942 massacre were the members of Tinkovitzki family including Riva Tinkovitzkaya (Tinkowicka?, born in 1909), Zelik Tinkovitzkaya (born in 1912) and Estera Tinkovitzkaya (born in 1871). Aftermath Word spread about the \\"Zhetel partisan detachment\\" among Jews in the labor camps of Dworzec and Nowogr√≥dek. A number of Jews escaped and tried to join them. Many of these were then caught on the way to the forest and handed over to the Germans by the locals. The \\"Zhetler detachment\\" in turn exacted revenge on such collaboration. One act of revenge-killing took place in the village of Molery on 10 September 1942. After eliminating two collaborators, the Jewish partisans also informed the elder of the village and the local villagers about the precise reasons why they carried out this reprisal. Tuvia Bielski related a much larger number of bloody revenge killings of Belarusian families whose farms were later burned down. However, \\"the fact that there are hundreds of survivors would indicate ‚Äì wrote Yehuda Bauer ‚Äì that there were a fairly large number of people willing to engage in rescue\\" of Jews also. For example, a Polish couple Jan and J√≥zefa Jarmolowicz (Jarmolowitz), later awarded titles of Righteous among the Nations, hid five Jews for over a year on their farm.

Tuhabonye (born November 22, 1974) is a Burundian long-distance runner, author, and motivational speaker. He was born in Songa, a town in the Commune of Songa, Burundi, where he survived a massacre during the Burundian Civil War. He moved to the United States and wrote a book about his survival. He is also married to Triphane and has two daughters named Emma and Grace. Biography Tuhabonye is a survivor of the massacres during the Burundian Civil War of the early 1990s. In October 1993, members of the Hutu tribe invaded Tuhabonye's high school and captured more than 100 Tutsi children and teachers. Most of the captives were killed with machetes; the rest were burned alive. After spending nearly nine to 10 hours hidden beneath the burning corpses of his classmates and suffering burns over much of his body, Tuhabonye managed to escape and seek medical attention. He published his account in This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness (HarperCollins Publishing, 2006).Austin Chronicle By 1996, his running skills took him to the United States as part of an Olympic training program. He obtained a track scholarship at Abilene Christian University and was a national champion runner. Tuhabonye is the award-winning coach of Gilbert‚Äôs Gazelles Training Group in Texas. In 2006, he co-founded the Gazelle Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to improve life for people in Burundi without regard to tribal affiliations.

A compression seal fitting may serve several purposes: *It restrains the element from moving as a result of a pressure difference. *It prohibits the leakage of gas or liquid media along the element. *In some cases, it electrically isolates the element from the mounting device. A compression seal fitting, unlike an epoxy seal or gasket, uses mechanical components and an axial force to compress a soft sealant inside a body which then creates a seal. An epoxy seal differs in that it is composed of some type of compound which is poured into a mold in an attempt to create a seal. Applications Typical applications include pressure vessels, autoclaves, holding tanks, pipelines, furnaces, or anywhere wires or sensors need to pass from inside to outside a vessel or wall where the pressure differentials or hazardous environments cause concern. File:Conax Pressure Vessel Wall2.JPG Components A very basic compression seal fitting is composed of four mechanical parts: *The body, which holds the elements being sealed and enables the other components to compress into it. *The cap, which secures the sealant and follower into the body. Most importantly, when it is torqued into the body, it pushes the follower into the sealant which creates the axial force and creates the seal. *The follower, which is pushed into the sealant from the torque on the cap and compresses the sealant. The sealant then fills all void spaces around the element and between the body. *The soft sealant (a solid rubber-like component, not a liquid or paste), which surrounds the elements being sealed and when it is compressed by axial force, a hermetic (airtight) seal is created. The continuous tension in the torqued body acts like a spring to maintain compression on the sealant and maintain a positive seal. Some soft sealants include Neoprene, Viton, Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene), Lava sealant (magnesium aluminum silicate), and Grafoil (graphite foil). The appropriate sealant for a gland depends on the environment the person is trying to seal against. A single compression seal fitting may seal on a single or multiple elements. Sealing glands designed to seal on single elements consist of a body, cap, sealant and follower. When sealing on multiple elements, gland designs also include a seat and an anti-rotation pin to prevent wires or conductors from twisting and shearing. One or more insulators may also be included when electrical isolation is required. File:Conax Sealing Gland Parts2.JPG History and development Soft sealant technology for compression seal fittings was developed in the 1950s by Conax Technologies. Since then, compression seal fittings have evolved to include multiple variations for different applications. Some applications include: Single- element sealing Single-element compression seal fittings are used to seal a single element such as a temperature probe, tubewell, pipe, etc. *Packing Gland (PG) Series - for sealing on anything from fragile tubes and soft cables to solid probes or instruments *Midlock (MK) Series - Best used for sealing on metal elements and/or high vibration environments *Electrode (EG) Series - Fully isolating for electrical power or instrument isolation to 8000 V. Teflon insulation and sealant material used for high performance and chemical resistance. *Split (PGS) Series - seals cables and leads when larger probes or connectors are attached. Multiple-element sealing Multiple-element compression seal fittings are used when multiple elements of the same or different diameters such as metal tubing, ceramic or rigid plastic tube or pipe, temperature probe, a tubewell, low voltage instrumentation wire, or a power supply feedthrough. *Transducer (TG) Series - For bare wire sealing where elements remain fully electrically isolated throughout the fitting *Multi-hole Ceramic (MHC) Series - Non-isolating fitting for multiple elements up to diameter *Multi-hole Metal (MHM) Series - A flexible design for special hole patterns, irregular shapes, and mixtures of element sizes *Split (PGS/SPG/DSPG) Series - For sealing elements that can pass through gland body but not the internal components *Sensor Wire Seal (BSWS) Series - For sealing sensor leads in low-temperature and pressure applications. Ideal for embedded bearing temperature sensors, vibrations sensors, and proximity probes.

He was born in September 1955, in Aragon, a province in Spain. According to some in the news-media, he is one of the ‚Äúlast adventurers‚Äù. Background and education Jos√© Manuel is the only son of a humble family. He initiated his education under the auspices of a P.I.O (Equal Opportunities Scholarship) through High School. He was admitted to study art in the School of Arts in Zaragoza. He did not obtain a degree because he enlisted in the Spanish Air Force. He went through military parachute school and later enrolled in the Spanish Legion. A restless traveller, he studied Culinary Arts in France. He has worked, on and off, as a Chef in many countries. The contacts he made in France with the Roma, Manouche and Tsigane tribes greatly interested him and he decided to start a project about the Romas' laws that are orally passed unwritten from generation to generation. Jos√© Manuel has worked as: Chef; designer; composer; radio- commentator; writer-editor of the ‚ÄúEl Informador‚Äù, a Santa Marta, Colombia newspaper; as a tourist-guide in the South American jungle, and many others. Wanderer, writer and chef During his long stay in South America, he trekked the inner jungles of Colombia where he stayed with the Puinave tribes, (the Ant-men) and the Yanomami and Pemone tribes of the Venezuelan-Brazilian border region. What he learnt during his stay with these primitive cultures with their uncontaminated moral and behavioural ethics, led him to compare norms and customs of cultures not integrated in what the first world would define as modern society. With new insight he finished his self-appointed project to compile a code of unwritten Romas laws. On his return to Europe he worked as a Chef de Cuisine in Spain and published his first book: ‚ÄúGastronom√≠a en tiempos de San Francisco Javier‚Äù (Gastronomy in the times of Saint Francis Xavier), ordered by Sociedad Cultural Baja Monta√±a/Mendi Behera, of Navarre, Spain. Subsequently, under the auspices of the Excelent√≠simo Ayuntamiento de Sos del Rey Cat√≥lico, Zaragoza, Spain, he published a research book: ‚ÄúLa Cocina Medieval en la Villa de Sos del Rey Cat√≥lico‚Äù (Medieval Kitchen in the Villa of Sos del Rey Cat√≥lico); this book was shortlisted (2nd) with regards to the ‚ÄúWorld Award Cookbook‚Äù ‚ÄìGourmet Prize-, sponsored by Cointreau. Thereafter his interests wandered away again, and his research project of the Roma‚Äôs laws ‚ÄúLa llama frente al hurac√°n‚Äù, was published by Editorial AQUA, Zaragoza. This book, ‚ÄúThe flame in front of the hurricane‚Äù, is more than a legal code; it is a code of ethics and conduct for Gipsy Patriarchs. In 2007 Editorial AQUA published ‚ÄúCon la Mirada de un dios cobarde‚Äù (Under the Sight of a Cowardly God) Jos√© Manuel wrote that the saga of a Roma Patriarch with Gipsy laws is compared to the law of Moses, present Judaism, Hinduism and Christian religions. The books ‚ÄúLa llama frente al hurac√°n‚Äù and ‚ÄúCon la mirada de un dios cobarde‚Äù were selected to represent Editorial AQUA in the Aragon government's stand at the Editor‚Äôs Book Fairs in Barcelona (Spain), Frankfurt (Germany) and Guadalajara (Mexico).

Burke and her sister Beulah Burke were two of the nine cofounders. In her leadership as an educator and organizer, Burke created important social capital. The chapter Burke helped establish in Washington, DC helped support African-American women in the community in their leadership of the next generations in society. Lillie Burke demonstrated in her work as an educator and active sorority member how African-American sororities supported women \\"to create spheres of influence, authority and power within institutions that traditionally have allowed African Americans and women little formal authority and real power.\\"Tamara L. Brown, Gregory Parks, Clarenda M. Phillips, African American Fraternities and Sororities: The Legacy and the Vision. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2005. p. 342. Early life Born c. mid-1880s in Hertford, North Carolina, p. 7. Burke moved with her family to Washington, DC. There she and her sister Beulah attended the Howard Preparatory School. They graduated in 1904, ready to enter Howard University later that year. It was a historically black college. Howard University Lillie Burke was one of the sixteen founders (specifically one of the original group of nine founders) of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. She and her sister Beulah were instrumental in organizing the sorority. They also created its motto, as they were both accomplished Greek scholars. Lillie Burke graduated from Howard University with a Bachelor of Arts in English. When she graduated from the top historically black college in the nation, it was a time when only 1/3 of 1% of African Americans and 5% of whites of eligible age attended any college.James D. Anderson, The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860‚Äì1935. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1988, p.245 Burke went on to earn a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Career and community life Burke had a long career as an educator in English in academic programs in public high schools, primarily in Washington, DC, where she worked for most of her career. She was also head of the academic department at Downing Institute in Pennsylvania. In North Carolina she taught at the State Normal School at Fayetteville to prepare new generations of teachers, which was considered one of the most important careers in the South. Retrieved 2007-12-10 Burke encouraged and taught generations of students through 30 years as an educator in the Washington, DC public school system. Although the schools were segregated, because the District of Columbia was then run directly by the Federal government, African-American teachers were paid at the same scale as white teachers. The system attracted highly qualified teachers, especially for Dunbar High School, the academic high school for African Americans.Thomas Sowell, \\"The Education of Minority Children\\", Retrieved December 12, 2007 After Burke returned to Washington in 1912, she helped charter the Xi Omega alumnae chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha. She continued to contribute to the community through her activities with the sorority and her church. She died in Washington, D.C. in 1949.

The project was developed by the consortium Dragon International Studios, chaired by Richard Attenborough. The project has been nicknamed \\"Valleywood\\" as an homage to Hollywood, in the manner of other Hollywood-inspired names such as Dollywood and Bollywood. Construction The construction of a film studio in South Wales was first proposed in 2001, with two developers, Fairfield Properties and Westair Properties backing the production of a 350-acre site in Llanilid near Bridgend. The Welsh Assembly government at first objected the plans, unhappy with proposals to link the studios to the M4 motorway by building a new junction to connect the site. Discussions in October 2002 between the Assembly and Rhondda Cynon Taf local council, Assembly member Pauline Jarman and the consortium behind the bid resolved the issues. Agreements were reached that any new access links to the M4 would only occur if a percentage of the development was completed and the construction of a theme park, which was part of a \\"Phase 2\\" of the plans. The initial proposals had an estimated budget of ¬£350m, rising to a cost of ¬£1bn after the completion of a screen academy and the theme park. Lord Attenborough, who was the chair of Dragon International Studios Limited, promised the studio would create 1,700 local jobs, with the local council believing a further 6,000 jobs would be created from a proposed adjacent development by the Villard Partnership, which planned to build hotels, a conference centre, health spa and a new hospital. Due to the collapse of heavy industry in South Wales over the previous decades, the development, itself built on the site of a former open-cast coal mine, was seen by those involved as a major economic boost to an area with high unemployment. The following year, despite approved planning and a proposed completion date of 2004, no work had commenced at the site. The then chief executive of Dragon International Studios, Steve Villard, accused the Welsh Assembly of holding up the project through failing to approve grants needed to begin construction and threatened to move the whole project to a rival site in Newport. The government's response was to state that they gave assistance to cases that provided \\"truly viable business case\\". In August 2004 commencement of work was finally declared. In early 2005, with no buildings complete, work was delayed again after dormice, a protected species in Britain, were found on the site. Despite Lord Attenborough's belief that the studio would be completed by 2004, a hold up in a grant meant that by May 2005 work at Llanilid had not commenced. In July 2005 work again halted when the firm was found not to have the necessary permits to carry out sewage works. This was followed by further delays when bad weather hampered progress until March 2006. Six years after the project was first proposed and nearly four years after planning permission was granted, construction work started on the first phase of the scheme in August 2007. Productions and finance In March 2008 administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers were called in to resolve the financial situation after both Dragon International Studies and Westair Ltd went into administration. The companies owed ¬£15m to creditors including ¬£3m to Barclays Bank and ¬£600,000 to the Welsh government. The administrators appointed Edward Symmons to advise them, who as of 2012 was continuing to seek a buyer for the stages as well as looking for television and film opportunities. One option open to the administrators has been to sell off the additional land on the site that was ear-marked for the \\"Phase 2\\" developments. This has led to various proposals by businesses to develop the land next to the film studio including plans for 2,000 homes, a primary school, health centre, library, recreation facilities and shops. Despite their financial issues, in October 2009 filming began for the studios' first film, Ironclad. Starring Paul Giamatti, the film focuses on the great siege of Rochester Castle when, following the signing of the Magna Carta, King John gathered an army to reclaim his power and exert bloody revenge on those who defied him. The television series Doctor Who utilised the studios in September 2010 to film sequences within the TARDIS corridors for the fourth episode of the sixth series, The Doctor's Wife.The Doctor Who Companion: The Eleventh Doctor Volume Three, Panini, 2011 Dragon Studios have also been used by the BBC for the filming of series 1 of Upstairs Downstairs, the series Whites starring Alan Davies, and Merlin.

After this army collapsed due to disagreements with the Japanese, the Indian Independence League placed Kiani as Army Commander of the remains, with Jaganath Rao Bhonsle as Director of the Military Bureau. After the arrival of Subhas Chandra Bose in 1943 and the revival of the Indian National Army, as well as the proclamation of the Free India government, Kiani was appointed the commander of the first division, who he led during the invasion of India in 1944. At the time of the fall of Rangoon, Kiani led the personnel of the Indian National Army and the Azad Hind Government who, along with Bose, marched to Bangkok. After Bose flew to Tokyo in August 1945, Kiani surrendered to the British 5th Division at Singapore on 25 August 1945 as the commander of the INA, along with the rest of his troops. He was repatriated to India and interned until 1946, before being cashiered and discharged from the British Indian Army.  Poonch Rebellion  Following the Partition of India, Kiani returned to Rawalpindi after the independence of Pakistan in 1947. In September 1947, the Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan and the Punjabi minister Shaukat Hayat Khan put him in charge of the southern wing of the Pakistan's effort to overthrow the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. General Kiani established a General Headquarters, GHQ Azad, based in Gujrat City. From here, Kiani's forces organised raiding operations on Kashmir border and directed the Kashmiri rebels in Poonch, eventually leading to the formation of Azad Kashmir. Brigadier Habibur Rehman served as his Chief of Staff.  Later life  Kiani was later appointed the Political agent of the Government of Pakistan at Gilgit. He wrote his memoirs while in retirement in Rawalpindi. They were published after his death: * ReferencesSources  * *  External links  * Extract from Sugata Bose, A Hundred Horizons, world- journal.net, archived on 6 October 2007.

The festival was known for attracting a largish audience for free improvisation, modern jazz composition and all kinds of British modern jazz in general. However, over the years Bracknell featured a wide range of performers from old-fashioned r'n'b legends like Alexis Korner or Jack Bruce, fusion stars such as Allan Holdsworth or Barbara Thompson, British modern jazz performers of all shapes and ages and a strong line-up of visiting stars such as Ornette Coleman, Stanley Clarke, Don Cherry, Pharoah Sanders, George Coleman and many more. In the words of festival organiser John Cumming ‚Äì \\"The keynote of the Festival is to provide the jazz scene ‚Äì listeners and musicians alike ‚Äì with a weekend of the best in British jazz, spiced with visiting Americans, in an informal, relaxed atmosphere.\\".Stan Tracey ‚Äì The Bracknell Connection Cumming, director of Serious Productions went on to organise Camden Jazz with Charles Alexander and Peter Luxton from the Jazz Centre Society, and the London Jazz Festival.  Overview  The festival was held from 1975 onwards in the grounds and the house of South Hill Park, a Victorian manor house converted into an arts centre in the Berkshire town of Bracknell, a typical Thames Valley new town. As well as the jazz festival, the centre is a venue for performances and education in jazz, other kinds of music and other art forms throughout the year. Most of the performances were held in large marquees on the lawn, while some events including workshops for musicians were held in rooms in the house. The beer tent was run by the local branch of CAMRA (the campaign for real ale) offering strong ales from many parts of southern England. Journalist Steve Lake wrote in 1976, \\"Up against the madness of American and Continental jazz festivals Bracknell had seemed, initially, a tranquil, even sedate affair. Musicians and their families picknicked outside the main marquee, cocking lazy ears to the sound of Ralph Towner's delicate twelve-string arpeggios. It was all very pleasant.\\"Stan Tracey ‚Äì For All We Know Later many elements of the festival survived as the Outside In festival held in Crawley West Sussex. South Hill Park seen from the garden, February 2006 Mainstays of the Bracknell festival included the perennial compere and soprano saxophonist Lol Coxhill; free improvisers such as drummer John Stevens, trombonist Paul Rutherford, drummer Tony Oxley and saxophonist Evan Parker; many musicians in and around the Mike Westbrook orchestra, such as John Surman; South Africans such as Dudu Pukwana and Johnny Dyani; drummer Roger Turner, sax player Elton Dean, and other members of the so-called Canterbury scene; pianist Django Bates and other bastions of the British modern jazz scene. The festival was always opened by local talent, the Berkshire Youth Jazz Orchestra. The festival often featured a work especially commissioned for the event by the Arts Council of Great Britain, these included: Stan Tracey's Bracknell Connection in 1976, Mike Westbrook's The Cortege in 1979, and Graham Collier's Hoarded Dreams in 1983. The 1970s=1976 The Arts Council Commission was The Bracknell Connection a piece by the Stan Tracey Octet, featuring Peter King (alto), Art Themen (tenor), Don Weller (tenor), Harry Beckett (trumpet), Malcolm Griffiths trombone), all British jazz performers who would revisit the festival many times over the years. The piece was later recorded at the 100 Club in London and released on Steam Records. Other acts included guitarist Ralph Towner and a duet between Stan Tracey and Mike Osborne, which was released as the Tandem to good reviews. 1977 Elton Dean's Ninesense, a nonet featuring Dean, Alan Skidmore, Harry Beckett, Marc Charig, Nick Evans, Radu Malfatti, Keith Tippett, Harry Miller and Louis Moholo, performing the Arts Council commission, a suite later recorded in a studio and released as Happy Daze on Ogun Records. A popular act, Ninesense were to return the following year and Elton Dean again in 1980 (with a quintet). And famously 1977 saw Bracknell's beloved compere Lol Coxhill performing his legendary monologue \\"Murder in the Air\\", following which he was asked to record it as a 12\\" single Chiltern Sound records.Chiltern Sound single 1978 The headline act was Ornette Coleman. Other acts included the trio of British free improvisers John Stevens, Trevor Watts and Barry Guy, who returned the following year with pianist Howard Riley. Also appearing was the Pat Metheny Group ‚Äì Metheny/Mays/Gottlieb/Egan ‚Äì a few months after its debut UK performance. A sign of things to come; the record stalls sold out of the quartet's eponymous ECM album before the set was over. And Saxophonist David Murray played an unforgettable long solo-concert. 1979 The headline act on the Friday night was Rocket 88 a boogie-woogie big band including Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts and Ian Stewart the \\"6th Stone\\" on piano along with bassist Jack Bruce, London r'n'b legend Alexis Korner and an array of British horn-players. Also appearing were the Jan Garbarek Group with Bill Connors, Jon Christensen, Eberhard Weber & John Taylor. The Arts Council commission that year was The Cortege by the Mike Westbrook Orchestra, described as \\"a composition for Voices and 16-piece Jazz Orchestra including settings of poetry, arranged by Kate Westbrook, by Lorca, Rimbaud, Hesse, John Clare and other European poets, sung in the original languages by Kate Westbrook and Phil Minton\\".Kate Westbrook Singer / Songwriter The piece was later recorded as a triple album. Other acts in 1979 included the Ed Bickert Trio and guitarist Mike Stern. The 1980s John Stevens was back again in 1980 with European free improvisers Marc Charig, Paul Rutherford, Peter Br√∂tzmann, Barry Guy and Peter Kowald. Other acts included two electric guitarists ‚Äì Jeff Clyne's's jazz-rock group \\"Turning Point\\" and the young Pat Metheny. ‚Äì go here for a photo, and the British group Spirit Level led by sax player Paul Dunmall, who were also to return in 1981. 1981 Drummer Max Roach played a short set, much of it a drum solo, (there are bootleg recordings available). The Ray d'Inverno trio performed a tribute to Bill Evans. Canadian electric jazz band Uzeb did their first show abroad which was recorded as Live in Bracknell and then digitally re-mastered and re-issued in 2006 to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary. 1982 The headline act was the incredible reunion of legendary John Coltrane Quartet members Elvin Jones and McCoy Tyner. John Stevens' album Freebop was recorded at the festival the band including Evan Parker, and received a five-star review from Down Beat magazine. This year saw a duet between Abdullah Ibrahim and Carlos Ward that has been described as \\"delicate, poignant, austere ...conjuring a resonance from the simplest tune\\".Lock, Graham (1994). Chasing the Vibration. Stride. . Trumpeter Lester Bowie, from the \\"Chicago Art Ensemble\\", appeared with his group, \\"From The Roots to the Source\\", which featured vocalists Fontella Bass, David Peaston, pianist Art Matthews, tenor saxophonist Ari Brown, and drummer Phillip Wilson. 1983 The Arts Council commission was Hoarded Dreams, a big band led by bass player Graham Collier and including musicians such as Kenny Wheeler, Tomasz Stanko, John Surman, Ted Curson, Henry Lowther, Manfred Schoof, and Malcolm Griffiths. The piece was recorded at the festival and released on Cuneiform Records. Another live recording made that year was the highly praised \\"Gheim\\" by the Paul Rutherford Trio. The headline act was the Bobby Hutcherson Quartet featuring Tete Montoliu and Billy Higgins, which was broadcast on BBC radio. 1984 Stan Tracey was back again with a quartet including his son Clark Tracey and saxophonist Art Themen performing his Poet's Suite.

History of the camp  In Freiberg in December 1943, preparations began for a subcamp of KZ Flossenb√ºrg to house an outside detail at the Arado Flugzeugwerke (Arado Aircraft Factory). The planning and construction of this housing subcamp is a clear example of the collaboration between the armaments industry, the SS, and the Ministry of Armaments. The SS approved the application for the allocation of a prisoner work-detail that Arado had submitted within the context of the Jaegerstab's (Fighter Staff's) measures. In its building application, Arado was represented by a building commissioner of the Reich Ministry for Armaments and War Production (RMfRuK) based in Dresden. The Reich Industry Group (the lobbying organization for the armaments industry) for the Land of Saxony, Regional Office Dresden, undertook the planning of the subcamp. Bureaucratic hurdles delayed the construction of the subcamp. When the first transport arrived on August 31, 1944, the barracks were not yet complete and the prisoners had to be lodged in the empty halls of a former porcelain factory. According to concurring reports from many of the prisoners, they were personally selected at Auschwitz by Dr. Josef Mengele for deportation to Freiberg. He decided who went on the transport, who stayed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, and who was to be murdered immediately. When the female prisoners were transferred to the still unfinished barracks in December 1944, they faced considerably worse living conditions. With bare feet and inadequate clothing, they were forced daily to walk half an hour in deep snow to the factory. Some also had to go to the Hildebrand munitions factory. The cold and wet concrete barracks, the brutality of the SS female guards, the physically draining work, and malnourishment soon claimed the lives of a number of prisoners. Though only five deaths were recorded in SS documents, the actual number may be higher. Women who arrived at Freiberg pregnant and whose condition became apparent once they were there suffered especially. Priska Loewenbein (Lomova), a Slovak prisoner, gave birth to her daughter Hana on April 12, 1945, two days before Freiberg was evacuated. Other women gave birth during the evacuation transport or shortly after arriving at Mauthausen. In addition to Hana, at least two more babies were born during the transport to Mauthausen. The three survived, much later learned of each other, and met at a 65th anniversary memorial at Mauthausen. If there were other babies, their fate is unknown at this time. While all three mothers survived to old age. Only one is still (as of early 2012) living in England at age 95, frail but with a clear, lively mind. None of the three fathers survived the war. Of the approximately one thousand women who began in Freiberg, about one hundred twenty five were definitely accounted for as having survived to leave Mauthausen alive and their subsequent whereabouts known. Possibly double that number actually survived, but starvation, disease and cold conditions claimed the majority. The American soldiers (Most from Patton's 3rd Army, mainly of the 11th Armored Division (Thunderbolts)) who liberated Mauthausen on May 5, 1945 were unprepared for what they found, but they quickly moved to help the sick and wounded. One young medic, Leroy Petersohn, age 22, a newspaper employee back home in Aurora Illinois, not only provided medical help and supplies, but some exceptional documentation. Within a week of arriving at Mauthausen he got use of a typewriter and extensively wrote his observations. He also took numerous pictures and later gathered documents and artefacts. He gave valuable eyewitness testimony for people who had doubts about the facts of the concentration camps. Mr. Petersohn, members of his family and numerous members of the \\"Thunderbolts\\" befriended survivors of Mauthausen and formed a special lifelong bond. Mr. Petersohn died in 2010, but he has touched many lives in a quiet, heroic way. His writings and memorabilia are some of the clearest eyewitness reports touching on the above subjects. There were many thousands of prisoners at the Mauthausen liberation. This is just about the women transported from Freiberg. Female SS guards, some of whom were recruited from the Freiberg area and some of whom came with the prisoners from Auschwitz, supervised the women. SS Unterscharfuehrer Richard Beck was in command at the camp and oversaw 27 SS Unterfuehrer and SS men, in addition to the females guards. After work was halted on March 31, 1945, the prisoners at Freiberg were left on their own in the barracks. Food rations were reduced. Prison demographics The first transport arrived on August 31, 1944, with 249 primarily Polish Jewish women and girls from Auschwitz‚Äîwhom the Flossenb√ºrg commandant assigned prisoner numbers 53,423 through 53,671. The second transport arrived on September 22, 1944, with 251 women from Auschwitz, also primarily Polish Jews, who were assigned prisoner numbers 53,672 through 53,922. The third transport was registered on October 12, 1944, delivering 501 Jewish women and girls‚Äîassigned prisoner numbers 53,923 through 54,171; 54,187 through 54,335 and 56,801 through 56,803‚Äîto Freiberg. This transport included 183 Czechs, 158 Slovaks, 90 Germans, 25 stateles persons, 23 Dutch, 14 Hungarians, 6 Poles, 1 Serbian, and 1 American. Additionally there was a Russian female doctor assigned with prisoner number 59,939. The fact that the prisoners from each of the three transports were assigned consecutive numbers indicates that the transports were completely coordinated with the Flossenb√ºrg main camp beforehand. In total, there were 1,002 women assigned to the outside detail at Freiberg. A strength report on January 31, 1945, still listed 996 women in the Freiberg camp.  Literature  Cziborra, Pascal. KZ Freiberg. Geheime Schwangerschaft. Lorbeer Verlag. Bielefeld 2008. Survivor testimony Hana L., a Czech prisoner, reported: > \\"They always assembled in groups of five, followed by the high SS marching > by in their perfect uniforms. It was Dr. Mengele personally who sorted the > people into those capable of work and prisoners destined for gassing. As we > were both dressed in a good coat and an anorak, he signaled my cousin Vera > and me to the right and my mother to the left, which meant to the gas. ...My > mother said in good German, 'Please, these are my children.' Mengele now > also signaled my mother to the right. We did not suspect that to the right > meant work and life and to the left meant gas and death. ...But the great > miracles were still to come. They took all of our things away, shaved our > hair, and everyone received a dress and wooden clogs or other shoes. > ...Until I die I will never forget the feeling of the cold on my shaved > head. Without hair -- that is a complete degradation for a woman. We were so > many that the SS did not manage to tattoo all of us. ...Still in October we > were put on a transport toward Germany. That was like a prize. Thus we > reached Freiberg in Saxony.\\" In contrast to the wretched barracks in the women's camp at Auschwitz- Birkenau, the lodgings at the factory in Freiberg‚Äîwhich were heated and, to some extent, dry‚Äîappeared considerably better to the women. Anneliese W., then 16 years old, said of the barracks: \\"It appeared to be a good change from Auschwitz. We slept only two to a bed, had pillows and a type of blanket.\\" Several women reported on the employment, such as Katarina L, a Slovakian prisoner: \\"We worked in two shifts, 12 hours each, as heavy laborers building airplane wings. As we were not skilled workers in aircraft construction, we also made mistakes, which were answered with slaps in the face.\\" Marie S., a Czech, described the relationship between the prisoners and the German civil workers: > \\"My work consisted mostly of riveting the 'small wing' with another female > prisoner. There was no foreman around, only an inspector who came by daily > to check whether we had worked well. Once I asked him where we were. To be > sure[,] he answered me, but only briefly, ['I]n Freiberg['] and added that > he was forbidden to speak with gypsies. When I then said to him that I was a > pharmacist and my husband was a doctor, he convinced himself with the help > of medications that I had not lied. He then muttered, 'The fascists have > deceived me.' After that he always told us what was reported from London.\\" Hana St., another Czech prisoner, recounted a similar exchange: > \\"This conversation appears strange, almost like a joke, but I find it very > instructive as it is probably something like a reflection of the foggy > thinking, brought about by the Nazi propaganda haze, of so many 'little > people' in Germany at that time. ‚Ä¶This dialogue with Foreman Rausch took > place in the first days: with hand motions and no words he sent me to get > some tool, but I didn't bring the right one. Furious, he grabbed me by the > dress and beat me against the scaffolding. I was indignant and told him that > when he wanted something he would have to explain it to me as I had never > before worked in a factory. Rausch was surprised that this creature -- > resembling a scarecrow -- [had] addressed him, and even in German. He asked > me where I had worked and what type of work I had actually done. In another > conversation we talked about the concentration camp and I explained to him > that I was sent there as a Jew. To that[,] foreman Rausch replied in > amazement[,] 'But the Jews are black!' I had blue eyes and[,] despite a > shaved head[,] was without doubt a dirty blond[e] with a light complexion. > And when I asked him -- I was so impudent -- if he knew what concentration > camps are, he answered me[,] 'Yes, that's where various elements are trained > to work.' I then informed him that we were brought from Auschwitz to > Freiberg. I told him that we all had studied and worked normally and that > among us were a number of highly educated women, JDs, PhDs, holders of > master's degrees (Magister), doctors, professors, teachers, etc.; that I > myself, at that time 23 years old, [had] completed my diploma at a classical > high school in 1939 and later worked as a qualified infant nurse and child > care professional. Ever since that conversation Foreman Rausch treated me > well.\\" But the testimony Herta B., a German Jew, provided during her witness examination differed greatly: \\"Zimmerman was the foreman in an airplane factory at Freiberg. ‚Ä¶[He] had a group of about twenty prisoners to supervise. He repeatedly abused me physically. He threw shop tools, which I was required to bring him, at my back, or he tore the tool from my hand and beat me with it.\\" The foreman described here is likely the same one about whom other female prisoners reported: \\"He screamed, 'What, you claim to be a teacher? You piece of dirt!' and once again the hammer flew.\\" Lisa M., a Czech prisoner, reported on the evacuation: \\"On April 14, 1945, there was a sudden departure. We were loaded into open cars at the train station and traveled westward into the protectorate, passing train station signs with familiar city names. The nights were cold and sometimes it snowed or rained. Only sometimes did we receive food. En route we encountered similar transports to ours almost daily. Then we had a long stop in Horn√≠ Br√≠za and were transferred into closed cars. The people of the town brought us something to eat. We were supposed to be brought back to our original camp, Flossenb√ºrg. We owe our thanks to a brave station manager who despite threats held up our train. We traveled back in the direction of Budweis. No one knew what happened in the other car. Once a day the car was opened and someone shouted the command '[O]ut with the dead.' We noticed that the train changed direction. On April 29 we stood in the train station at Mauthausen. Half starved we dragged ourselves through the town. At a fountain we wanted to at least drink something, but the locals chased us away und threw stones at us. In the camp we found out rather quickly that the gas chambers were already out of action.

West African volunteers and conscripts of the Tirailleurs S√©n√©galais units of the French army mutinied against poor conditions and defaulted pay at the Thiaroye camp, on the outskirts of Dakar, Senegal. Background As colonial subjects, tirailleurs (colonial infantry) were not awarded the same pensions as their French (European) fellow soldiers during and after World War II, pensions that had been promised to them at the beginning of the war. The pensions for veterans of both races were calculated on the basis of living costs in their countries of birth, supposedly lower in colonies than in metropolitan France. These soldiers additionally claimed they were owed back pay due to an order issued by the Minister of Colonies authorizing benefits for ex-prisoners of war from West Africa, which both fell short of the benefits given to French prisoners of war and was in any case not implemented. This discrimination led to a mutiny by about 1,300 Senegalese tirailleurs at Camp Thiaroye on 30 November 1944. The tirailleurs involved were actually from Guinea, Mali, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Chad, Benin, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Central African Republic, and Togo. The former prisoners of war had been repatriated to West Africa and placed in a holding camp awaiting discharge. They demonstrated in protest against the failure of the French authorities to pay salary arrears and discharge allowances. The immediate grievance was the unfavorable exchange rate applied to currency brought back by the repatriated soldiers from France. A French general, briefly held by the tirailleurs, promised to have the rate changed to a par with that applicable to white veterans. Suppression Early the following morning French soldiers guarding the camp opened fire killing between thirty-five and seventy African soldiers. A detailed French-language account of the massacre states that 24 of the former prisoners were killed outright and eleven subsequently died of their wounds However, war veterans claim that over 300 of the black African soldiers were killed while the French only claim 35 deaths. The French provisional government of Charles de Gaulle, concerned at the impact of the Thiaroye incident on still-serving tirailleurs, acted quickly to ensure that claims for back pay and other monies owing were settled. Aftermath In March 1945 a military tribunal sentenced some of the survivors to ten years in prison. Five of the prisoners died in detention. As President Vincent Auriol visited Senegal in March 1947, the prisoners were released, but the didn't receive their veteran pension. After the war ended, the French argued that the tirailleurs were particularly prone to revolt. The French have based this claim on the notion that German soldiers, in an attempt to undermine the loyalty of France‚Äôs colonial subjects in Africa, had given the tirailleurs favored treatment as prisoners of war. This ostensibly good treatment of tirailleurs in prisoner of war camps was not, however, based in fact. Furthermore, there is no mention of the Thiaroye Massacre in any of France's history books taught in school. Despite the complications of the massacre, France still currently has strong political and military connections with Senegal, which could explain why the film was so poorly received and censored in France. A new generation of French leadership wants to confront the past and even planned to build an exhibition about the incident, which would travel to former French colonies in Western Africa in 2013. While the incident is merely mentioned, there is a military cemetery in Senegal that is unkept and receives no visitors. The cemetery holds the unmarked mass graves of the fallen French soldiers. The Senegalese army prevents any film or photography of the cemetery, and many locals consider the cemetery to be haunted due to the fallen French soldiers still awaiting the vengeance of their honor. In art and literature Senegalese author and filmmaker Ousmane Semb√®ne, directed a film, Camp de Thiaroye (1988), documenting the events leading up to the Thiaroye massacre, as well as the massacre itself. The film is considered historical fiction, as the characters are not necessarily based on actual tirailleurs who were killed. The film received positive reviews at the time it was released and continues to be heralded by scholars as important historical documentation of the Thiaroye massacre. The movie was banned in France for over a decade. Guinean writer Fod√©ba Ke√Øta wrote and staged the narrative poem Aube africaine (\\"African Dawn\\", 1957) as a theatre-ballet based on the massacre. In African Dawn, a young man called Naman complies with the French colonial rulers by fighting in the French Army only to be killed in Thiaroye. His works were banned in French Africa as he was considered radical and anticolonial.

Marchenko, originally an apolitical oil driller from a poor background, turned to writing and politics as a result of several episodes of incarceration starting in 1958, during which he began to associate with other dissidents., pg. 17, pg. 25 Marchenko gained international fame in 1969 through his book, My Testimony, an autobiographical account written after his arrival in Moscow in 1966 about his then-recent sentences in Soviet labour camps and prisons., pg. 5 After limited circulation inside the Soviet Union as samizdat, the book caused a sensation in the West after it revealed that the Soviet gulag system had continued after the death of Joseph Stalin. In 1968, in the run-up to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, Marchenko wrote an open letter predicting the invasion. Arrested again, he was released in the early 1970s, but in 1974 he was interrogated and internally exiled to Irkutsk Oblast. In 1976, Marchenko became one of the founding members of the Moscow Helsinki Group, before being again arrested and imprisoned in 1981, where he kept writing throughout his prison time, publicizing the fate of Soviet political prisoners. Having spent about 20 years in all in prison and internal exile, Nathan Shcharansky said of him: \\"After the release of Yuri Feodorovich Orlov, he was definitely the number one Soviet prisoner of conscience.\\"\\"To Live Like Everyone\\", pg. vi becoming one of the Soviet Union's \\"perpetual prisoner[s]\\". Anatoly Marchenko died at age 48 in Chistopol prison hospital, as a result of a three-month-long hunger strike with the goal of which was the release of all Soviet prisoners of conscience.\\"To Live Like Everyone\\", pg. 219 The widespread international outcry over his death was a major factor in finally pushing then-Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to authorize the large-scale amnesty of political prisoners in 1987.  Early life  Anatoly Tikhonovich Marchenko was born on 23 January 1938, in Barabinsk, Novosibirsk Oblast, in the Siberia region of the Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, to illiterate railway workers from a peasant background. His father, Tikon Akhimovich, was a locomotive fireman, and his mother was a train station cleaner. The couple had two other sons, one of whom died in infancy. His grandfather had been shot by Aleksandr Kolchak. Marchenko left school two years short of the normal full secondary education in the Soviet Union. He then joined the Komsomol, and became a shift foreman for an oil drilling group, which travelled around the Siberia region.  First imprisonment and political prisoner  In 1958, while on a job at the Karaganda power station, Marchenko ran into trouble which resulted in his first period of imprisonment: some exiled Chechens began a fight with some of the Russian workers in the hostel where Marchenko was staying.\\"To Live Like Everyone\\", pg. 217 Marchenko broke up the fight, but after the fight was over and most of the combatants had left, \\"the police indiscriminately arrested the innocent and the guilty\\"; they were all sent to the Karaganda labour camps.\\"My Testimony\\", pg. 13, pg. 25 Two-years later, Marchenko escaped from the camp, ironically just as his sentence was about to be overturned. Seeing no future for himself in the Soviet Union, he tried to escape over the border into Iran, however he was captured on October 29 near Ashkabad, just short of the border. Marchenko was subsequently tried for treason on 2 March 1961 - the charge of treason was because he supposedly intended to engage in work against the Soviet Union for money - in reality it was payback for his attempt to leave. On 3 March 1961, he was convicted for treason and was sentenced to six-years in labour camp, officially designating Marchenko a political prisoner, not an ordinary criminal as he was previously.\\"My Testimony\\", pp. 26-27 After several months in a series of transit prisons, Marchenko was moved to a labour camp in Mordovia where attempted to escape, but did not succeed, and as a result he was sentenced to serve three-years of his sentence in a regular prison, which he spent in the infamous Vladimir Prison. While in Vladimir, he went on a long hunger strike, a tactic he would often later repeat. In 1963, Marchenko was moved from Vladimir back to the labour camp in Mordovia. While there, in March 1966, he survived a bout of meningitis with almost no medical care, which caused problems with his ears which would trouble him for the rest of his life. During his time in the camps Marchenko educated himself, reading a number of accessible socio-political works, including the complete works of the Communist figures Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and the founder of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin. Marchenko also met a number of intellectual political prisoners, including Yuli Daniel.  First release and My Testimony  Marchenko was released on 2 November 1966, and spent months travelling through the Russian SFSR, trying to find a locality which would allow him register to live there. He finally succeeded in being allowed to register in his birthplace Barabinsk, and later in Alexandrov, Vladimir Oblast. From May 1968, while still formally living in Alexandrov, Marchenko was working in Moscow as a loader, the only job available to him, even though doctors had warned him not to do hard manual labour. During this time he had met several fellow dissidents, including Larisa Bogoraz, the wife of his associate Yuli Daniel, who were in the process of legal separation. Marchenko was determined to write a record of the camps, and his fellow prisoners, and he enlisted their aid in his project. They also helped him receive medical care, both for his ears, and for problems with internal bleeding in his stomach. The Gulag labor camp system operating in the Soviet Union had been heavily associated with General Secretary Joseph Stalin, whose death in March 1953 started an amnesty limited to non-political prisoners and for political prisoners sentenced to 5 or fewer years. Most of those released were convicted for common crimes, however the release of political prisoners started in 1954 and became widespread. Stalin's successor as General Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced Stalinism in his Secret Speech at the 20th Congress of the CPSU in February 1956, which coupled the amnesty with mass political rehabilitation. The Soviet state continued to maintain the extensive camp system for a while after Stalin's death, although the period saw the grip of the camp authorities weaken, and a number of conflicts and uprisings occurred in this time. The Gulag institution was closed by the MVD order No. 020 of January 25, 1960, but forced labor colonies for political and criminal prisoners continued to exist - one of the most famous camps in the system, Perm-36, operated continuously until 1987 when it was closed. By December 1967, Marchenko had finished work on his book, My Testimony, the first book to reveal that the gulag had continued in full operation after the death of Joseph Stalin, which had been believed by many inside and outside of the Soviet Union to have been dismantled by Khrushchev. My Testimony provided a detailed account of both his time in labour camps and in prison, as well as a wide-ranging look at conditions there. The publication of the book would later earn Marchenko further imprisonment for anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda. The book was described by the Daily Telegraph as \\"An extraordinarily important book ... a totally realistic, detailed, factual and yet profoundly and human account of Russian prison and camp life...\\".  Open dissidence  On 5 September 1967, Marchenko announced to the authorities his association with the dissident circle by appearing at a search of the apartment of the mother of Alexander Ginzburg, the subject of another famous show trial. On 27 March 1968, Marchenko wrote an open letter to Alexander Chakovsky, then editor of the Literaturnaya Gazeta, contradicting a letter from Chakovsky which had been published that day, which had charged that dissidents were \\"fed .. at public expense in [Soviet] prisons [and] corrective labour colonies\\". Marchenko bitterly refuted the charges from his own personal experience, pointing out that rations were minimal, and the prisoners over-worked. On 17 April, he followed this up with a series of letters on the same subject to the head of the Soviet Red Cross, and other highly placed people. Marchenko soon began to focus on the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and on 22 July 1968, he wrote an open letter to a variety of publications, including Communist media in the West, about the situation there, predicting that the Soviet Union would not allow the 'Prague Spring' to continue. This action was too much for the authorities: as a result, on 28 July, Marchenko was arrested and charged with \\"violating passport regulations\\" because of his presence in Moscow. On 21 August, the same day that the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia as he had predicted it would, he was sentenced to the maximum penalty for that crime, one-year in a labor camp. In reality, his crime had been the open letter about Czechoslovakia. Marchenko was then sent to a camp in Perm Oblast, where he was scheduled to be released on 27 July 1969, but before that could happen he was tried on charges of \\"defamation of the Soviet political system\\", notionally for statements on the subjects of Czechoslovakia and human rights in the Soviet Union which he supposedly had made in while imprisoned in the camp. In reality, as Soviet officials later admitted, it was payback for the publication of My Testimony in the West, for which he was tried on that charge on 22 August and convicted, and on August 26 he was sentenced to a further two-years of imprisonment.  Exile to Siberia  Although many of Marchenko's associates did not expect him to live through this imprisonment, including his American publisher E. P. Dutton, he did, and was released in August 1971. After his release Marchenko was given a choice for his place of internal exile, choosing Chuna, a town in Irkutsk Oblast where his fellow dissident Larisa Bogoraz was also in internal exile. Bogoraz had been sentenced to four-years of internal exile after being arrested in August 1968 for publicly protesting the invasion of Czechoslovakia. Now fully divorced from Yuli Daniel, a process that Bogoraz had started before she met Marchenko, she and Marchenko had become lovers during the period after his first release from prison. The two eventually married before September 1972, when the couple moved to Tarusa, Kaluga Oblast, where they moved into a dilapidated house which Marchenko rebuilt. While there, they had a son, Pavel, born that winter. Marchenko's health was still poor, and he was unable to find any work other than manual labour as a furnace stoker in a factory.  Continued dissident activity  Tarusa was only about 100 kilometers from Moscow, so Marchenko and Bogoraz were able to maintain contact with dissident circles in the capital, which were being increasingly repressed as they more openly challenged the government. The couple had considered emigrating out of the Soviet Union, and the increasing repression caused them to pursue this idea further. On 23 August 1973, Marchenko wrote to Kurt Waldheim, then-Secretary- General of the United Nations, expressing concern about the condition of another imprisoned writer. A letter to Willy Brandt, warning of the dangers of d√©tente, followed. The authorities replied with increased repressive measures aimed at Marchenko through 1974, and the more they pressed him, the more it moved him to act. On 10 December, Marchenko wrote a letter to Nikolai Podgorny, then-Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, renouncing his Soviet citizenship, and indicating he intended to emigrate to the United States. The Soviet response was to encourage him to apply for an exit visa to Israel, which they could use for propaganda purposes, and because of this Marchenko refused to cooperate even though he could have easily changed his destination once out of the Soviet Union. In response to his refusal to cooperate in any way, on 26 February 1975, he was again arrested, and charged with violating the \\"administrative supervision\\" measures which had been imposed on him the previous summer. An account in the samizdat periodical, A Chronicle of Current Events, details his life hitherto and the subsequent trial at the Kaluga City Court. Marchenko's response was to begin a hunger strike, on which he was still engaged when he was tried a month later on 31 March. He was quickly convicted, and sentenced that day to four years of internal exile to Siberia, again to Chuna. During a two-week wait for transport to begin, and for a week thereafter, Marchenko continued his hunger strike. During this entire period, he received no special treatment, and was handled just like all the other prisoners, only giving up on 21 April (53 days after it had begun) when it became clear to him that he was at risk of death. His transportation to Siberia through a series of prisons in Sverdlovsk, Novosibirsk, and Irkutsk lasted through the rest of April and May.  Second exile to Siberia, From Tarusa to Siberia and To Live Like Everyone  On arrival in Chuna, Marchenko started work as a log handler at a sawmill, a place where he had worked during his previous period of exile. Later in 1975, he suffered an attack of neuritis, and was hospitalized in Irkutsk, although he was forced to leave before he was fully recovered. During his exile, he managed to complete his second book, From Tarusa to Siberia, in October 1975, which covered his then-recent trial and hunger strike. In 1976, Marchenko became one of the co-founders of the Moscow Helsinki Group, a prominent human right organization in Russia and the former Soviet Union. In September 1978, Marchenko's term of exile ended and he was allowed to leave Chuna. He and his family moved back to the vicinity of Moscow, where he was given an ultimatum to leave the Soviet Union or go back to prison, but ignored it. During this period, Marchenko completed his third and final book, To Live Like Everyone, the title was a favourite phrase of his. It covered the period from 1966 to 1969, when he was writing My Testimony, up through his trial in retribution for its publication. The publication of this new book lead to his final arrest in 1980, and on 3 September 1981, Marchenko went on trial again for \\"anti- Soviet agitation\\", and the next day was given a 15-year sentence: 10-years of imprisonment and 5-years of internal exile.  Final hunger strike and death, August‚ÄìDecember 1986  Details about Marchenko's last period of imprisonment are largely unknown, although in December 1983 he was badly beaten by guards, and fell unconscious unconsciousness as a result. The first report of his death was published in mid-December 1986 in USSR Update,\\"The death of Anatoly Marchenko\\", USSR Update, 15 December, Issue 22/23-1, reprinted on CCE website. the fortnightly digest of news compiled in Munich by Kronid Lyubarsky. Over the next few years, Bogoraz began a public campaign to free all Soviet political prisoners, which proved ultimately successful when General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev began mass releases in 1987. However, this proved too late for Marchenko, who had died on December 8, 1986, at the hospital of the prison in Chistopol, Tatar ASSR. The exact cause of his death is not certain; some reports indicate problems with his heart and others a stroke, however it is agreed to have been related to the hunger strike. Marchenko died not long before Gorbachev's announcement - ironically from the effects of a hunger strike demanding the release of all Soviet political prisoners. This last hunger strike started on 4 August 1986 when he wrote a letter to the Helsinki review conference in Vienna. Despite little reaction to his hunger strike from the world press, Marchenko continued to through November, although Bogoraz believed that he ended it around the end of November, when he was placed on the sick list. There were indications shortly before his death that the Soviet authorities were on the verge of releasing him. Marchenko died after being hospitalized the day before, and every effort to conceal the reason for Marchenko's death was made, as KGB deputy chairman Bobkov's report to the Politburo indicates. His wife and their son travelled to Chistopol to bury him there, as they were not allowed to bring his body back to Moscow for burial. Marchenko was buried on 12 December, near the prison in Chistopol, after Russian Orthodox rites at a church nearby. Bogoraz was denied a death certificate, and had to write his name in ballpoint pen on the pine wood cross on his grave.  Posthumous Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought  On the award of the Sakharov Prize to his widow, Larisa Bogoraz, in 1988, Andrei Sakharov himself paid tribute to Anatoli Marchenko, saying, in a message to the EP: 'in My Testimony Marchenko was the first to tell the truth about the post-Stalin labour camps and prisons. His book became one of the foundation stones of the human rights movement in our country. With its spirit of morality through non-violent struggle for justice, with its aspiration towards unconcealed and complete truth, the book aroused the hatred of the organs of repression towards its author. The whole of his subsequent life and his tragic death on Chistopol prison was their way of repaying him for this truth, this steadfastness, for his high moral principle. The achievement of Marchenko's life and work is an enormous contribution to the cause of democracy, of humanity and of justice'.  Quotations  *\\"When I was locked up in Vladimir Prison I was often seized by despair. Hunger, illness, and above all helplessness, the sheer impossibility of struggling against evil, provoked me to the point where I was ready to hurl myself upon my jailers with the sole purpose of being killed. ..

Salvi became friends with Gaspar del Bufalo and Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari ‚Äì future pope ‚Äì during the course of his studies prior to his ordination. He was forced out of the Passionist house due to anti-clerical laws from Napoleon Bonaparte but later returned when safe to do so in order to preach and spread the charism of the Child Jesus. Salvi was beatified on 1 October 1999. Life Lorenzo Salvi was born in Rome on 30 October 1782 to Antonio Salvi and his first spouse Marianna Biondi. He was baptized in the church of San Eustachio in the names of \\"Lorenzo Gaetano Maria Salvi\\" and he received his Confirmation sometime later at Saint Peter's Basilica. He studied for the priesthood at the Jesuit-run the Collegio Romano in Rome; his classmates included Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari ‚Äì future pope ‚Äì and Gaspar del Bufalo. He was impressed with the solid preaching and the apostolic zeal of Vincent Strambi and soon followed him into the Passionist order. He became a novice at Monte Argentario on 14 November 1801 (the first convent of the order) and he professed his vows on 20 November 1802 ‚Äì and received the religious name of \\"Lorenzo Maria of Saint Francis Xavier. Salvi was later ordained to the priesthood on 29 December 1805 just after Christmas in Rome. The anti-clerical laws that Napoleon Bonaparte instituted saw the Passionist house suppressed and its members dispersed in 1810. He was soon able to return to Passionist life and he preached missions and encouraged devotion to the Passion of Christ. He was devoted to the Infant Jesus and often wrote about and preached on the wonders of the Incarnation and this intensified after the Child Jesus was said to have healed him from a serious illness in 1812. He was made the rector of the Passionist motherhouse in Rome (Santi Giovanni e Paolo) but spent much of his time preaching missions; his vice-rector was Dominic Barberi. Barbieri noted Salvi's strength and evangelic zeal and so requested permission from the order's superior general to send him to England to preach but such permission was denied. Salvi died at Capranica in Viterbo; his remains are interred in the Passionist church of San Angelo. Beatification The late priest's theological and other spiritual writings received approval from theologians on two occasions on 22 December 1915 and on 3 December 1944 and ascertained that such writings did not contravene official doctrine. The introduction to the cause came under Pope Pius XI on 28 February 1923 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The postulation submitted the Positio in 1984 and theologians approved the cause on 29 September 1987 as did the C.C.S. on 15 December 1987; the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope John Paul II to name him as Venerable on 8 February 1988. John Paul II later beatified the Passionist priest on 1 October 1989. The current postulator for this cause is the Passionist priest Giovanni Zubiani.

Slave Trader Snelgrave began transporting slaves with his father, William Snelgrave Sr., who was a first- mate on the Eagle. The elder Snelgrave died in Virginia in 1704. Upon his father's death, Snelgrave soon became a ship captain making numerous voyages including transport of 367 slaves to Virginia in 1720. In 1734 he published A New Account of Some Parts of Guinea and the Slave-Trade. The book includes a justification and defense of the slave trade. He dedicated his book to the European merchants of West Africa. Capture by Pirates Snelgrave was captured by pirate captains La Bouche, Thomas Cocklyn, and Howell Davis along the coast of West Africa in 1719. He was originally attacked by Cocklyn's quartermaster for failing to surrender. He was beaten and shot in the arm, but his men cried out \\"For God's sake, don't kill our captain, for we were never with a better man.\\" Snelgrave was then spared. Snelgrave wrote about his captivity with the pirates. He described how Davis claimed that \\"their reasons for going a pirating were to revenge themselves on base merchants and cruel commanders of ships.\\" This probably explains why Snelgrave was spared, despite the fact that he intended to fight the pirates.Black Bart Roberts: The Greatest Pirate of Them All by Terry Berverton In 1727 he arrived at Whydah which had just been captured by Dahomey. His account of this event, which he learned of second hand, has been the main source of many modern historians. Snelgrave died in 1743.

Zeevi attended elementary school in the religious Zionist village of Kfar Haroeh, where his classmates represented a cross-section of Israeli society. They included Jews of every background: Ashkenazi, Sephardi, religious, secular, and even one Arab girl ‚ÄîNadia, for whom the film is named. Now, more than twenty-five years after graduating from elementary school, Zeevi has organized a class reunion that brings together men and women whose lives have diverged from the original journey begun in Kfar Haroeh. Summary Religious Zionism has become an intolerant, polarizing, radical element of Israeli society, and that change threatens to tear Israel apart from the inside, declares filmmaker Chanoch Zeevi. In Nadia's Friends, Zeevi uses the profoundly subjective lens that he and his grade school classmates offer to examine this phenomenon and its impact on the Jewish State. ‚ÄúWe felt that we were a part of religious Zionism‚Äôs elite unit that was destined to produce an open and religious ideal youth,‚Äù says Zeevi of his childhood years spent in the religious Zionist infrastructure. The dream was to build ‚Äúa model of an ideal Jewish society of soil-tilling religious Jews who would integrate in the general Zionist society and be a bridge between the religious and the secular.‚Äù For Zeevi, the experience of his childhood represents the ideal of religious Zionism, an inclusive movement that sought to unify the Jewish people and the Israeli public ‚Äî to be the bridge between people on different sides of the ideological, political and ethnic divides. Where his own generation was taught to ‚Äúwalk between the drops and to beware of political radicalism,‚Äù today‚Äôs religious Zionists are increasingly embracing political radicalism, he asserts. The result, says Zeevi, is that ‚Äúthe encounters that were so natural back then‚Äù ‚Äî encounters between the religious and the secular, the Jew and the Arab ‚Äî ‚Äúno longer happen.‚Äù But the viewer discovers that, in his nostalgia, Zeevi romanticizes the Israeli melting pot. The same culture of tolerance that he lauds also sought to eliminate non-Western influences and impose Ashkenazi culture and practice on Jews and Arabs of the East. Indeed, Zeevi was blissfully unaware of the difficulties faced by some of his classmates, Jews of Sephardic descent, as they tried to acclimate and adapt themselves to their new, Ashkenazi surroundings. Nor are Zeevi‚Äôs former classmates the unified religious Zionists Zeevi might have expected them to become. Indeed, they span the entire gamut of political, ideological and religious affiliations in contemporary Israel. Sarah'le is the daughter of the first victim of the Palestinian Intifada, and is herself a well-known settler activist. She declines Zeevi‚Äôs invitation because, she says, she doesn‚Äôt want to be the radical in the group. Another former classmate is now an ultra- Orthodox, anti-Zionist husband and father of five who resides in an insular community where contact with outsiders is extremely limited. Sophie, a divorcee and mother of two, is dating a Thai immigrant and says that she is not particularly concerned about issues of Jewish identity. Thus, the very values that Zeevi idealizes as shaping the religious Zionist movement of his childhood are being rejected, in one form or another, by his own former classmates. Nadia's Friends offers little in the way of answers or resolutions to the issue of conflict within Israeli society, but it does present an attempt at dialogue between the competing voices of the Israeli public. In the process, the film raises interesting and important questions about the state of the Jews in the Jewish State, and the viewer learns, together with Zeevi, that these questions don‚Äôt always have pat, easy answers.

Grown as an ornamental plant, the species is endemic to the State of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.Kew World Checklist of Selected plant Families It is a rapidly growing, creeping, perennial plant, pruning shoots about 60 cm per year. Etymology The genus name Mandevilla was awarded by John Lindley, a botanist, in memory of Henri Mandeville (1773-1861), one of his fellow British gardening enthusiasts who was a diplomat in Buenos Aires (Argentina). The sanderi species name refers to Henry Frederick Conrad Sander (1847-1920), a horticulturist and collector from Hertfordshire (in the UK) who brought the plant back from Brazil.R. E. Woodson, 1933 In: Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard., 20: 720 In 1896 WB Hemsley of Kew Gardens gave the first botanical description of the plant, which he named Dipladenia sanderi Hemsl. However, in 1933 Robert E. Woodson, who had undertaken a large taxonomic study of the Apocynaceae, made significant changes in the Mandevilla constituency. By including several genres such as Dipladenia inside Mandevilla, the plant ended up with the name Mandevilla sanderi.Wahiba Boutebtoub , \\" Localizing Starch Reserves in Mandevilla sanderi (Hemsl.)

Mandevilla sanderi is a shrub with a naturally bushy habit, 2‚Äì3 meters high, or 4.5 meters (15 feet) if the climate is warm. It is able to develop long, woody stems based on lignin and climbs by twining around some support. This twining growth is characterized by long internodes, small leaves and a stem rarely carrying flowers. The plant contains a white latex, which is viscous, toxic, and can be irritating. In addition to fine roots, it has large tuberous roots that contain starch and a reserve of water, allowing it to withstand drought. The evergreen, petiolate, thick, leathery, dark green leaves are opposite, and grow to 6 cm (2.5 in) long. The blade is ovate-elliptical, 5‚Äì6 cm long, with a glossy upper surface and a thick epidermis. The apex is shortly acuminate.Roskov Y., Kunze T., Orrell T., Abucay L., Paglinawan L., Culham A., Bailly N., Kirk P., Bourgoin T., Baillargeon G., Decock W., De Wever A., Did≈æiulis V. (ed) (13 augusti 2014). The inflorescences are simple racemes, usually terminal (sometimes axillary) that gather at a given moment, 3‚Äì4 pimples and a large blooming pink-red flower, 4‚Äì7 cm in diameter. Each flower has a chalice in cup with five teeth lanceolate-subulate scarious, a large corolla infundibular pink (funnel-shaped) formed of a cylindrical tube of 4‚Äì5 mm in diameter, which widens abruptly in a tube 15‚Äì18 √ó 25‚Äì30 mm, terminated by 5 oval lobes, acuminate, spreading, partially overlapping. The five stamens include threads inserted into the tube and connective anthers, forming a ring around the head. The long flowering period extends from spring to autumn. The flowers grow gradually from early summer to late winter, growing 2‚Äì3 on stalks in the leaf corners. The fruit is dry, capsular, formed of two long follicles, and opens lengthwise like a silique. Cultivars Many cultivars have been created: *Sundaville¬Æ 'Moulin Rouge' with red scarlet velvety flowers, with a clear chalice and throat *Sundaville¬Æ 'Dark Red' (2008), with dark red flowers *Sundaville¬Æ 'Cream Pink' (2008), with pale pink flowers with a deep throat *Tropidenia¬Æ, with pink flowers Other cultivars: Mandevilla 'Red Riding Hood' with pale red flowers, 'My Fair Lady' with white flowers, yellow throats and pink buds, 'Alba' with white flowers, 'Rosea' with pale pink flowers and yellowish throat, etc. Usage In temperate regions of Europe, it is usually grown in pots indoors, and possibly outdoors in the summer. Horticultural forms are generally sold under the name of Dipladenia. Indoors, the plant must be installed in a bright area, protected from drafts. Outside, it is to be placed in a warm and bright place, in the sun, while ensuring that the midday sun does not spoil it. In the open ground, once well installed, it can withstand drought. If exposed to frost, however, it would die immediately. The plant requires regular watering during the flowering period, allowing the soil to dry well between waterings. It prefers to be sprayed with non-calcareous water. Every two weeks, it is recommended to add fertilizer for flowering plants when watering in the summer. The most important condition for the success of the crop is to provide the plant with a constant and high humidity of the air.

The main goal of user modeling is customization and adaptation of systems to the user's specific needs. The system needs to \\"say the 'right' thing at the 'right' time in the 'right' way\\". To do so it needs an internal representation of the user. Another common purpose is modeling specific kinds of users, including modeling of their skills and declarative knowledge, for use in automatic software-tests. User-models can thus serve as a cheaper alternative to user testing but should not replace user testing.  Background  A user model is the collection and categorization of personal data associated with a specific user. A user model is a (data) structure that is used to capture certain characteristics about an individual user, and a user profile is the actual representation in a given user model. The process of obtaining the user profile is called user modeling. Therefore, it is the basis for any adaptive changes to the system's behavior. Which data is included in the model depends on the purpose of the application. It can include personal information such as users' names and ages, their interests, their skills and knowledge, their goals and plans, their preferences and their dislikes or data about their behavior and their interactions with the system. There are different design patterns for user models, though often a mixture of them is used. * Static user models :Static user models are the most basic kinds of user models. Once the main data is gathered they are normally not changed again, they are static. Shifts in users' preferences are not registered and no learning algorithms are used to alter the model. * Dynamic user models :Dynamic user models allow a more up to date representation of users. Changes in their interests, their learning progress or interactions with the system are noticed and influence the user models. The models can thus be updated and take the current needs and goals of the users into account. * Stereotype based user models :Stereotype based user models are based on demographic statistics. Based on the gathered information users are classified into common stereotypes. The system then adapts to this stereotype. The application therefore can make assumptions about a user even though there might be no data about that specific area, because demographic studies have shown that other users in this stereotype have the same characteristics. Thus, stereotype based user models mainly rely on statistics and do not take into account that personal attributes might not match the stereotype. However, they allow predictions about a user even if there is rather little information about him or her. * Highly adaptive user models :Highly adaptive user models try to represent one particular user and therefore allow a very high adaptivity of the system. In contrast to stereotype based user models they do not rely on demographic statistics but aim to find a specific solution for each user. Although users can take great benefit from this high adaptivity, this kind of model needs to gather a lot of information first.  Data gathering  Information about users can be gathered in several ways. There are three main methods: * Asking for specific facts while (first) interacting with the system :Mostly this kind of data gathering is linked with the registration process. While registering users are asked for specific facts, their likes and dislikes and their needs. Often the given answers can be altered afterwards. * Learning users' preferences by observing and interpreting their interactions with the system :In this case users are not asked directly for their personal data and preferences, but this information is derived from their behavior while interacting with the system. The ways they choose to accomplish a tasks, the combination of things they takes interest in, these observations allow inferences about a specific user. The application dynamically learns from observing these interactions. Different machine learning algorithms may be used to accomplish this task. * A hybrid approach which asks for explicit feedback and alters the user model by adaptive learning :This approach is a mixture of the ones above. Users have to answer specific questions and give explicit feedback. Furthermore, their interactions with the system are observed and the derived information are used to automatically adjust the user models. Though the first method is a good way to quickly collect main data it lacks the ability to automatically adapt to shifts in users' interests. It depends on the users' readiness to give information and it is unlikely that they are going to edit their answers once the registration process is finished. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that the user models are not up to date. However, this first method allows the users to have full control over the collected data about them. It is their decision which information they are willing to provide. This possibility is missing in the second method. Adaptive changes in a system that learns users' preferences and needs only by interpreting their behavior might appear a bit opaque to the users, because they cannot fully understand and reconstruct why the system behaves the way it does. Moreover, the system is forced to collect a certain amount of data before it is able to predict the users' needs with the required accuracy. Therefore, it takes a certain learning time before a user can benefit from adaptive changes. However, afterwards these automatically adjusted user models allow a quite accurate adaptivity of the system. The hybrid approach tries to combine the advantages of both methods. Through collecting data by directly asking its users it gathers a first stock of information which can be used for adaptive changes. By learning from the users' interactions it can adjust the user models and reach more accuracy. Yet, the designer of the system has to decide, which of these information should have which amount of influence and what to do with learned data that contradicts some of the information given by a user.  System adaptation  Once a system has gathered information about a user it can evaluate that data by preset analytical algorithm and then start to adapt to the user's needs. These adaptations may concern every aspect of the system's behavior and depend on the system's purpose. Information and functions can be presented according to the user's interests, knowledge or goals by displaying only relevant features, hiding information the user does not need, making proposals what to do next and so on. One has to distinguish between adaptive and adaptable systems. In an adaptable system the user can manually change the system's appearance, behavior or functionality by actively selecting the corresponding options. Afterwards the system will stick to these choices. In an adaptive system a dynamic adaption to the user is automatically performed by the system itself, based on the built user model. Thus, an adaptive system needs ways to interpret information about the user in order to make these adaptations. One way to accomplish this task is implementing rule- based filtering. In this case a set of IF... THEN... rules is established that covers the knowledge base of the system. The IF-conditions can check for specific user-information and if they match the THEN-branch is performed which is responsible for the adaptive changes. Another approach is based on collaborative filtering. In this case information about a user is compared to that of other users of the same systems. Thus, if characteristics of the current user match those of another, the system can make assumptions about the current user by presuming that he or she is likely to have similar characteristics in areas where the model of the current user is lacking data. Based on these assumption the system then can perform adaptive changes.  Usages  * Adaptive hypermedia: In an adaptive hypermedia system the displayed content and the offered hyperlinks are chosen on basis of users' specific characteristics, taking their goals, interests, knowledge and abilities into account. Thus, an adaptive hypermedia system aims to reduce the \\"lost in hyperspace\\" syndrome by presenting only relevant information. * Adaptive educational hypermedia: Being a subdivision of adaptive hypermedia the main focus of adaptive educational hypermedia lies on education, displaying content and hyperlinks corresponding to the user's knowledge on the field of study. * Intelligent tutoring system: Unlike adaptive educational hypermedia systems intelligent tutoring systems are stand-alone systems. Their aim is to help students in a specific field of study. To do so, they build up a user model where they store information about abilities, knowledge and needs of the user. The system can now adapt to this user by presenting appropriate exercises and examples and offering hints and help where the user is most likely to need them. * Expert systems: Expert systems are computer systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in order to help the user solving a problem in a specific area. Step by step they ask questions to identify the current problem and to find a solution. User models can be used to adapt to the current user's knowledge, differentiating between experts and novices. The system can assume, that experienced users are able to understand and answer more complex questions than someone who is new to the topic. Therefore, it can adjust the used vocabulary and the type of question which are presented to the user, thus reducing the steps needed to find a solution. * Recommender system: The basic idea of recommender systems is to present a selection of items to the user which best fit his or her needs. This selection can be based on items the user has bookmarked, rated, bought, recently viewed, etc. Recommender systems are often used in e-commerce but may also cover areas like social networks, websites, news, etc. * User-Simulation: Since user modeling allows the system to hold an internal representation of a specific user, different types of users can be simulated by artificially modeling them. Common types are \\"experts\\" or \\"novices\\" on the scope of the system or the usage of the system. Based on these characteristics user tests can be simulated.

By Mu·∏•ammad Zuhdƒ´ Yakan. It was a major slave trading area. In 1700, it had a coastline of around ; under King Haffon, this was expanded to , and stretching inland. The Kingdom of Whydah was centered in Savi. The last ruler of Whydah was King Haffon, who was deposed in 1727, when Whydah was conquered (and annexed) by the Kingdom of Dahomey. Name The name Whydah (; ) is an anglicised form of Xw√©da (pronounced o-wi-dah), from the Yoruba language of Benin. Today the port city of Ouidah bears the kingdom's name; it is in the far west of the former Popo Kingdom and is where most of the European slave traders lived and worked. The area gives its name to the native whydah bird, and to pirate captain \\"Black Sam\\" Bellamy's Whydah Gally, a slave ship turned pirate ship. Its wreck has been explored in Massachusetts. Life inside Whydah Crowning of the King of Juida, by Jacob van der Schley (1715-1779) According to one European, who visited in 1692-1700, Whydah exported some thousand slaves a month, mainly taken captive from villages in the interior of Africa. For this reason, it has been considered a \\"principal market\\" for human beings. When the king could not supply the European traders with sufficient slaves, he would supplement them with his own wives. Robbery was common. Every thing in Whydah paid a toll to the king, but corruption amongst collectors was endemic. Despite this, the king was wealthy, and clothed in gold and silver--goods of which little was known in Whydah. He commanded great respect, and, unusually, was never seen to eat. The color red was reserved for the royal family. The king was considered immortal, although successive kings were recognized as dying of natural causes. Interregna, even of only a few days,were often occasions of plundering and anarchy by the populace. The patriarchal society isolated women, \\"protecting\\" them from the larger society (or other men). Fathers were recorded with more than two hundred children by their numerous wives. Three public objects were the subject of devotion: some lofty trees, the sea, and a type of snake. This snake was the subject of many stories and incidents; it may perhaps have been worshipped because it ate the rats that would otherwise ruin the harvest., .... Its worship was introduced into Dahomey when the kingdom of Whydah was conquered and annexed.... Priests and priestesses were held in high regard, and immune from capital punishment. The king could field 200,000 men. In comparison, other estimates range upward from twenty thousand, although contemporary interpretation is generally that these armies were of \\"overwhelming size\\". Battles were normally won by strength of numbers alone, with the weaker side fleeing. European presence Europeans at the coronation ceremony of the King of Whydah in April 1725 With King Haffon's rise to power in 1708, European trade companies had established a significant presence in Whydah and were in constant competition to win the King‚Äôs favor. The French Company of the Indies presented Haffon with two ships worth of cargo and an extravagant Louis XIV-style throne, while the British Royal African Company gifted a crown for the newly appointed King. Such practices illustrate the high level of dependence European traders had on native African powers in the beginning of the 18th century, and also the close relationship that emerged between the two entities. This association is further reiterated by the fact that Dutch, British, French, and Portuguese trading company compounds all bordered the walls of Haffon‚Äôs royal palace in the city of Savi. These compounds served as important centers of diplomatic and commercial exchange between European companies and the Kingdom of Whydah. While company compounds facilitated the interaction between European traders and native Africans, the true center of European operations in Whydah were the various forts that existed along the coast near the town of Glewe. Owned by the Portuguese Crown, the French Company of the Indies, and the British Royal African Company, the forts were mainly used to store slaves and trading merchandise. Made up of mud walls, the forts provided tolerable protection for the Europeans but were not strong enough to withstand a legitimate attack from the natives. Furthermore, because the forts were located more than three miles inland, cannons could not effectively protect European ships in the harbor and anchored ships could not come to the aid of the forts in times of need. In this sense, while the forts showcased some degree of European influence, the reality was that the Europeans relied heavily on the king for protection and local natives for sustenance and firewood. This relationship would take a drastic turn with the decline of royal authority and increase of internal power struggles throughout the 18th and 19th centuries that gave way to French colonization of the region in 1872.

The mine, which IG Farbenindustrie AG acquired in February 1941, was to supply hard coal for the IG Farben factory being built in Auschwitz. Besides the old F√ºrstengrube mine, called the Altanlage, a new mine (F√ºrstengrube-Neuanlage) had been designed and construction had begun; it was to provide for greater coal output in the future. Coal production at the new mine was anticipated to start in late 1943, so construction was treated as very urgent; however, that plan proved to be unfeasible. In the period before the Auschwitz concentration camp prisoners were sent to work at F√ºrstengrube, the mine employed Soviet prisoners of war, Jewish slave laborers, and forced laborers from the USSR in addition to its regular staff. Negotiations in July 1943 between Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf H√∂ss and representatives of IG Farbenindustrie AG and F√ºrstengrube GmbH, led to an agreement to build a new camp for approximately 600 prisoners‚Äîincreasing to 1,200-1,300 later‚Äîfrom Auschwitz. Mainly Jews built the new camp. They lived in the mine's forced-labor camp for Jews, which was under the so-called Organisation Schmelt; that camp was called Lager Ostland. The Jewish prisoners from that camp were taken away even before the prisoners were moved from the Auschwitz concentration camp. The camp report for August 1943 no longer mentions the number of Jews employed. The prisoners moved from Auschwitz then continued the subcamp's construction and expansion. In early September 1943, the SS began moving prisoners, probably including a few German prisoner foremen, from Auschwitz to the F√ºrstengrube subcamp, which appears as \\"Lager S√ºd\\" on mine maps. On September 4, 1943, the Auschwitz labor office reported that 129 prisoners were working at the F√ºrstengrube subcamp; by July 1944 that number had risen to approximately 1,200, 85 to 90 percent of whom were Jews. Polish Jews were the most numerous group, but Jews from Germany, Austria, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Greece were also present. Starting in the spring of 1944, there were also several dozen non-Jewish Polish prisoners at F√ºrstengrube. For the first three months, the subcamp was under the direct charge of Auschwitz headquarters; after November 22, 1943, under Auschwitz III-Monowitz. Effective May 22, 1944, the 3rd Guard Company of Auschwitz III took charge of the guard duty. SS Master Sergeant Otto Moll was named the subcamp's first commandant; he served in that position until March 1944. SS Technical Sergeant Max Schmidt succeeded Moll until the subcamp was shut down in January 1945. The SS staff at the beginning of 1944 consisted of 47 SS men and grew to 64 at the end of the year. Prisoners from Auschwitz who went to the F√ºrstengrube subcamp were mostly put to work extracting coal in the old mine and building the new one. Prisoners working in the old mine were divided up into three shifts: morning (5 a.m. to 1 p.m.), day (1 p.m. to 9 p.m.), and night (9 p.m. to 5 a.m.). Work at the mine was especially difficult and dangerous because of the low galleries and the abundance of water. Prisoners did not receive the required protective clothing and they were constantly vulnerable to beatings and abuse from the mine's civilian staff as well as prisoner-foremen. The prisoners building the new mine faced equally brutal and exhausting work. They worked in one shift, a day shift, doing all sorts of construction and assembly jobs in groups of painters, bricklayers, welders, metalworkers, and assemblers. Additionally, when the shifts were over, many of the prisoners then had to work to expand the camp. Only very sick prisoners were admitted to the camp infirmary. SS doctors conducted periodic selections there and among the other prisoners as well; prisoners who were no longer able to work were moved to the Birkenau hospital sector (BIIf). The rotation of prisoners was significant as new prisoners replaced those who had been selected. For example, from May 8 to 14, 1944, as many as 42 F√ºrstengrube prisoners entered the hospital sector of Birkenau. In spite of the hard conditions and fight for survival, despite the beatings and persecution, there were attempts to maintain a cultural life at the subcamp, in the form of band concerts and plays. Some prisoners secretly drew portraits of their fellow inmates. Only a few escapes and escape attempts from the F√ºrstengrube subcamp are known. Gabriel Rothkopf, a Polish Jew, escaped during the night of December 18‚Äì19, 1943, while returning from work at the old mine. In response, Commandant Moll personally shot a randomly selected group of prisoners in front of their fellows and left their bodies on the assembly ground until the next shift returned. Ivan Potekhnin, a Russian prisoner, escaped on April 15, 1944. In the spring of 1944, a group of prisoners dug a tunnel from a barrack, but during an inspection five German Jews were apprehended in it; they were later hanged. In June 1944, Commandant Schmidt shot a Russian prisoner who intended to escape from the subcamp. In late August 1944, yet another Russian prisoner was shot; he had attempted to escape in a freight car leaving the new mine construction site. The escape attempt of a Polish prisoner named Gorewicz, working in the forge, also ended with his execution. Polish miners on the site helped a group of Polish prisoners by smuggling messages, food, and news of the situation on the fronts. However, the camp's political branch got word of the activity, probably in late August 1944. The prisoners were sent to Auschwitz I and, after approximately two months of interrogation, they were brought back to F√ºrstengrube and hanged on October 10, 1944. In September, November, and December 1944, the Polish and Russian prisoners were moved to the Flossenb√ºrg, Buchenwald, and Mauthausen concentration camps. As of January 17, 1945, 1,283 prisoners, chiefly Jews, remained in the subcamp. On January 19, having burnt the camp's records, the SS led approximately 1,000 prisoners out of the camp, headed for Gliwice (Gleiwitz) via Mikolow. Severe cold and icy roads made the march difficult, and SS men killed anyone who fell out. On the evening of January 20, 1945, the F√ºrstengrube prisoners reached the Gleiwitz II subcamp, where they joined prisoners from Auschwitz III-Monowitz as well as some other subcamps. The next day, January 21, the SS loaded approximately 4,000 prisoners into open railway cars bound for Mauthausen. The authorities at Mauthausen did not accept the transport, however, as the camp was overcrowded, but sent the train on to Mittelbau (Dora), where it arrived on January 28. Out of 4,000 prisoners, only about 3,500 survived the seven-day trip. On January 27, 1945, at about 4:00 p.m., a dozen or so SS men entered the F√ºrstengrube subcamp and killed most of the remaining prisoners; some they shot, and some burned to death when the SS set their barracks on fire. Only the sudden arrival of Soviet troops forced the SS to flee, thus sparing a few of the prisoners. A mine employee who was present afterward reported that they buried 239 bodies. About 20 prisoners survived the massacre. One of them, former prisoner Rudolf Ehrlich, testified to these events on May 9, 1945, before the Investigation Commission for German Nazi Crimes at Auschwitz. In a United States Military Court trial in Dachau from November 15 to December 13, 1945, Otto Moll, the first commandant of the F√ºrstengrube subcamp, was sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out on May 28, 1946.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced that approximately 250 civilians were killed.Wounded Bear: The Ongoing Russian Military Operation in Chechnya, GlobalSecurity.org, August 1996 (Foreign Military Studies Office) According to Amnesty InternationalRUSSIAN FEDERATION Brief summary of concerns about human rights violations in the Chechen Republic Amnesty International and HRW more than 250 people were killed, while the elders of Samashki stated that up to 300 residents were killed during the attack. Operation The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) forces (identified as Sofrinskaya Brigade of the Internal Troops, Moscow Oblast OMON and Orenburg SOBR, some Moscow policemen and possibly members of the elite counter-terrorist unit Vityaz) began an operation to \\"mop up\\" the village (zachistka - an intense search of the streets, house-by-house) on April 7, in the area around the train station, and then, on April 8, through the entire village. According to Lt. Gen. Anatoly Antonov, deputy commander of MVD forces in Chechnya, it was \\"the first completely independent military operation by MVD troops,\\" carried out by combined units of more than 3,000 MVD troops, including 350 from the storm detachments. Artillery, a multiple rocket launcher battery, and tanks had also been deployed around Samashki. Interfax reported that Russian forces fired Uragan (BM-27) and Grad (BM-21) rockets on the village.Cluster Munitions Use by Russian Federation Forces in Chechnya, Mennonite Central Committee, 2000 Despite claims by Russian military sources, armed resistance in Samashki was not of an organized nature, as the main Chechen rebel forces left the village following the Russian ultimatum by Generals Antonov, Kulikov and Romanov, ending on April 6, 1995, to hand over the 264 automatic weapons supposedly present in Samashki (the villagers had handed in 11 automatic weapons). Before the ultimatum, Samashki had already been under siege for a prolonged period of time, and several failed storming attempts by the Russian forces had been undertaken since the beginning of the war in December 1994. However, the main force of more than 200 fighters left Samashki under the pressure of the village elders who wanted the village spared. The same elders and the village mullah were fired on by the Russians on the morning of April 7 while returning from the negotiations before the federal attack; the military command announced that it was the separatists who had shot at the elders. Nevertheless, a lightly armed village militia of some 40 self-defense fighters, all of them local residents, resisted the MVD and fighting ensued. A group of 12 fighters immediately broke out from the village, while the other groups put a Russian tank and two armoured personnel carriers (APCs) out of action before retreating as well. Both sides took casualties; two Russian troopers and four self-defense fighters have presumably been killed in combat. Several Russian armoured vehicles were lost during their advance due to land mines.(This is the account of the attack according to the investigation by the Russian human rights group Memorial, based on the interviews with survivors and the examination of the village by the activists.) The number of casualties among the MVD forces as released by the Russian commanders and spokesmen varies considerably, ranging from none dead and 14 wounded to 16 dead and 44 wounded,By All Available Means: The Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs Operation in the village of Samashki: 7.

THE MVD OPERATION TO TAKE SAMASHKI Memorial The federal officials also claimed that 120PR victory fades in fog of Chechen war, The Independent, April 20, 1995 \\"pro-Dudayev fighters\\" were killed in the village and that some 150 suspects were detained. The Information Telegraph Agency of Russia quoted Vladimir Vorozhtsov, chief spokesman of the regional Russian command, as denying any large number of civilian casualties. In the same report, however, Gen. Anotonov was quoted as saying \\"many\\" civilians had been killed in Samashki but they were supposedly killed by Chechen fighters. In the May 1995 press conference, Gen. Kulikov said: \\"This is warfare. They fired at us. We did not fire first. It is true that 120 residents died, but they were people who resisted us and fought us.\\" War crimes In 1996, Memorial compiled an incomplete list of 103, mostly male, villagers confirmed dead. Their minimum estimate of the general number of deceased was 112‚Äì144 people (in 2008, Memorial leader Oleg Orlov, who went into Samashki soon after the events of April 7‚Äì8, said he saw nearly 150 dead bodies), including some ethnic Russian residents. Russian troops intentionally burned many bodies, either by throwing the bodies into burning houses or by setting them on fire. Many of the burned corpses could not be identified and are not on the list. The majority of those killed were summarily executed during the house-to-house searches. The victims, which included elderly Chechen World War II (WWII) veterans and at least three (four according to the Ingush commissionDETAILS OF SAMASHKI MASSACRE EMERGE., The Jamestown Foundation, May 5, 1995 ) ethnic Russians, were usually executed by shooting at close range or killed with grenades in the basements, but some were beaten to death. Several of the other victims were apparently burned alive or shot while trying to escape the burning houses. Of the remaining deceased, 29 were established to having been killed by possibly combat-related causes (such as artillery and tank fire, conducted since the night of April 6, or armoured vehicle fire). The male population of the village was detained indiscriminately in the hundreds and taken to the \\"filtration camp\\" in the town of Mozdok in North Ossetia or to the temporary holding center in the nearby Chechen village of Assinovskaya (a number of them were executed during the march while tied to the armoured vehicles). There, the detainees were beaten and mistreated, and many of them were tortured; most of these who survived were released after a few days. The killings and the round-up were accompanied by widespread arbitrary and wanton destruction of property by Russian troops, as well as numerous reports of theft and pillaging. Hundreds of buildings were either destroyed (375 according to the May 1, 1995 U.S. Congressional hearing of Sergei KovalevRUSSIA: PARTISAN WAR IN CHECHNYA ON THE EVE OF THE WWII COMMEMORATION HRW ) or seriously damaged. The majority of the village's homes were destroyed in premeditated arson by the Russian troops; even the local school where the troops quartered was blown up as they left the village.Russians \`roasted' Chechen village, The Independent, April 14, 1995 Aftermath Up until April 10, villagers were not permitted to take out their wounded, while doctors and ICRC representatives were denied entry to the closed-off village (the Red Cross was authorized to enter only on April 27);Chechnya : aid distributed in the village of Samashki, ICRC, May 9, 1995 consequently, at least 13 of the wounded people died from lack of medical aid. From April 10 to 15 only Chechen women were allowed to go either way through the military cordon outside of the village. When Western reporters were allowed into Samashki for the first time since the assault on April 14, they found the village \\"littered with decomposing bodies.\\"Dissent on Chechnya: Word to the West, The New York Times, April 14, 1995 Reaction At around the time of the incident, Russian President Boris Yeltsin compared the Chechens to the Nazis during the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in World War II.Why do the Chechens hate rule by Russia?, Socialist Worker, September 11, 2004 The news of the massacre embarrassed Yeltsin's foreign guests, including Bill Clinton and John Major.Defiant Chechens fight on in nuclear bunkers, The Independent, April 17, 1995 The European Union expressed its concern regarding the incident, while Washington had warned that the events of Chechnya could wreck the anniversary event.Russians \`kill 250 Chechen civilians', The Independent, April 13, 1995 Member of the State Duma , who was smuggled to the village by Chechen women,Eyewitness to Samashki, The Moscow Times, June 1, 1995 compared the Russian troops to Nazi extermination squads: \\"What happened there was a large-scale punitive operation aimed at destroying the population. There was no organized resistance in Samashki. It was surely planned with the idea to kill as many as possible, in order to achieve a threatening effect.\\" The head of the Department of Caucasian Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences compared the massacre to that of \\"Khatyn in Belarus, Lidice in Czechoslovakia\\" and said that the name Samashki \\"sounds more sinister than My Lai in Vietnam.\\"Russian strategy in the Chechen-Russo War of 1994-96 The English-language newspaper The Moscow News wrote in an editorial: \\"What the Russians did in Samashki is what the Germans did to us throughout the war [WWII], but Russians did this to their own people. And that is unforgivable. What happened in Samashki during those days has only one definition. Genocide.\\" On the other hand, Stanislav Govorukhin of the official commission said \\"nothing unethical\\" has happened in Samashki. The brutality displayed in Samashki by Russian MVD forces succeeded in terrorizing many in Chechnya. Soon afterwards, neighboring towns and villages capitulated to the federal forces. Several other villages through Chechnya made bilateral truces with the Russians and asked the Chechen separatist forces to leave, although they secretly kept supporting Dudayev's government. Eyewitness account A Chechen surgeon, Khassan Baiev, treated wounded in Samashki immediately after the operation and described the scene in his book: > \\"Dozens of charred corpses of women and children lay in the courtyard of the > mosque, which had been destroyed. The first thing my eye fell on was the > burned body of a baby, lying in fetal position... A wild-eyed woman emerged > from a burned-out house holding a dead baby. Trucks with bodies piled in the > back rolled through the streets on the way to the cemetery. > While treating the wounded, I heard stories of young men - gagged and > trussed up - dragged with chains behind personnel carriers.

He is the author of an essay about horror literature that has been published several times in Mexico, Argentina and Spain. Paganism Luis G. Abbadie has studied paganism and neopaganism. He has focused on the study of Wicca for some time. His participation in the Primer Encuentro Nacional Wicca M√©xico (First National Meeting of Wicca, Mexico), Beltane 2003, an event organized by the now-defunct C√≠rculo GaiaC√≠rculo Gaia, constituted by Carmen Orellana (Tarwe N√©n) and Josepe Serna, would eventually become Comunidad Pagana de M√©xico, A.C. was controversial, as well as in the subsequent reply from Carmen Orellana (Tarwe N√©n), and was his first major participation in the neopagan community. Although he initially favored the use of the word Wicca to refer to the different manifestations of modern witchcraft, including more indigenous types, he became uncomfortable with the eclectic, hybrid nature of what he calls 'Neo-Wicca.' He distanced himself from it and completely changed his position. He outlined connections between what he chose to call 'Stregoneria' and paganism. 'Stregheria' is represented in published works such as Raven Grimassi as 'popular neopaganism'. Abbadie wrote El Sendero de los Brujos (2004), a book directed toward young readers as they are the ones recently attracted to neopaganism. In it, he tries to clarify very basic misunderstandings that he has observed among Latin American neopagans. He also attempts to give orientation to neophytes in Wicca and neopaganism.El Sendero de los Brujos (Ediciones Veglia, M√©xico, 2004). He has formed a small group studying reconstructed Stregoneria. Upon discovering other forms of traditions European witchcraft, he began his formal apprenticeship of Scottish witchcraft, called Hedgewitch o Circle Magic, which he has dubbed Crossways Craft or rather Oficio del Cruce de Caminos, adopting an already-existing phrase to designate his personal preference.

As a youth, Gruber belonged to the Zionist organizations Ha-Shomer ha-Tza'ir and He-halutz. When he was 14, Gruber went to Lw√≥w, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine) to attend high school. After graduation, Gruber remained in Lw√≥w for about two years. He then returned to Podhajce where he worked as a bookkeeper for a company that manufactured farm equipment and bicycles. Gruber was drafted to the Polish Army when he was 18 or 19. He served for a year and a half in Tarnopol, Ukraine. Two or three weeks before the war broke out in 1939, Samuel was called into the reserves. While training in Nowy SƒÖcz, Poland, Gruber's unit was unaware that the German forces had penetrated deep into Poland. The Germans surrounded Samuel's unit and fighting broke out. Samuel was shot in the arm and taken as a prisoner of war. After a month in the hospital, Gruber and the other prisoners were transported to Stalag 13, a camp in Langwasser, Germany, near Nuremberg. On the second day, Jews were ordered to present themselves. Gruber hesitated, but two of his Polish \\"friends\\" shoved him forwards saying, \\"Here is a Jew.\\" The prisoners were transported from Nuremberg to Ludwigsburg and then to M√ºnsingen, Germany. Because of his injured arm, Gruber was assigned to work in the kitchen. Gruber spoke fluent German, so he also helped out in the German offices. In 1941, Gruber and the other prisoners were transported to Gleiwitz (Gliwice), Poland and then to Lipowa 7 camp, Lublin, Poland. There, Gruber was forced to help build the Majdanek camp. Later that year, Soviet prisoners of war became the first inmates. Gruber recalled that the Soviets were treated horribly. A typhus epidemic broke out and Gruber, along with 400 others, was quarantined in a synagogue. A doctor with whom Gruber was acquainted gave him a shot that saved his life. Three hundred people died during the typhus outbreak. Gruber was assigned to work in an office of a hospital that distributed uniforms, rifles and pistols to German soldiers coming from the front. He was able to steal weapons, which were eventually sold to partisans. A Polish man advised Gruber to escape, saying that eventually everyone in the camps would be killed. On October 28, 1942, Gruber walked through Lublin to the forest, on the outskirts of town. Two partisans met Gruber and 22 other people, whom he had convinced to leave with him. Gruber was the leader of his partisan group. He changed his first name to Mietek, a typical Polish name, so that the Polish farmers would not know that he was Jewish. His group eventually joined the Parczew partisans and fought the Germans while attempting to save as many Jewish lives as possible. Gruber was liberated when the Soviets captured Lublin in 1944. He married in 1945. In 1946, Gruber left Poland. He was made head of a displaced persons camp for children at Prien am Chiemsee, Germany in 1947. Gruber immigrated to the United States in 1949.

Kempner studied law at the University of Freiburg and served as a public prosecutor in Berlin during the 1920s. In 1928 he was appointed chief legal adviser in the Prussian Ministry of the Interior. In this role he sought to prosecute Adolf Hitler for high treason and to ban the Nazi Party. After the Nazi Party's rise to power in 1933, Kempner was dismissed from the ministry and had his citizenship revoked because he was Jewish. He fled Germany in 1935. He settled in Italy, where he taught law, and moved to the United States in 1939. In the United States he became an adviser to the government, and he returned to his native country to take part in the Nuremberg trials in 1945. After the trials he remained in Germany, where he practised as a lawyer in Frankfurt from 1951. He died in K√∂nigstein im Taunus. Early life Robert Max Wasilii Kempner was born in Freiburg, Germany, on October 17, 1899. He was the son of Walter Kempner and Lydia Rabinowitsch- Kempner, who were both microbiologists and regarded as one of the prominent scientist couples of their time. His mother was the second woman to become a professor in Prussia. He studied law, political science and other subjects at the universities of Berlin, Breslau and Freiburg. He became the senior legal adviser to the Prussian police and an opponent of Nazism. He left Germany after Hitler came to power and settled in the United States, where he did research on European dictatorships at the University of Pennsylvania and was a consultant to the Department of Justice and other government agencies. Career Grave of Kempner, his parents and sister in BerlinAs a law student Kempner sat as an observer in the trial against Soghomon Tehlirian, who had assassinated Talaat Pasha in 1921, and made his defence an impeachment on the Armenian Genocide and Talaat's involvement in it.Robert Kempner, Ankl√§ger einer Epoche. Lebenserinnerungen, Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and Vienna: Ullstein, 1983, pp. 44seqq. . After finishing his studies Kempner became a successful lawyer in Berlin during the 1920s, and then advanced to chief legal advisor to the Prussian police in 1928. In 1935 Wilhelm Frick revoked Kempner's German citizenship, forcing him to emigrate to Italy and then later to the United States.http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007164 After World War II Kempner returned to Germany, the land of his birth, to serve as assistant U.S. chief counsel during the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. In a reversal of fortune, Kempner would prosecute two of his former superiors and persecutors ‚Äî G√∂ring and Frick. More familiar with the German legal system than any other member of the Allied staff, Kempner headed the Defense Rebuttal Section, the team responsible for anticipating the defense strategies of the accused and for preparing cross-examinations.¬´ Reversal of Fortune: Robert Kempner ¬ª, site of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Kempner also presented the case against his old nemesis Wilhelm Frick. This irony was not lost on the American press. One headline read, \\"Man He Exiled Presents Case Against Frick.\\" Kempner also served as counsel at the 1947‚Äì1948 trial of the German Foreign Office and is credited with finding the text of the Wannsee Protocol, a critical historical document in the history of the Holocaust. After Nuremberg, Kempner split his time between the United States and Germany where he represented Jewish clients in restitution cases against Germany. He also appeared as an expert witness at the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961. When Kempner left the Nuremberg trials in the mid-1940s, he took away thousands of trial documents, which he brought back to his home in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia. According to Patricia Cohen, who refers to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the prosecutor's office gave Kempner permission to take the documents away, but according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the removal of documents by Kempner was contrary to law and proper procedure.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \\"Long-lost Nazi diary recovered after HSI investigation\\", June 13, 2013, online.

The loose-leaf diary pages, dating from 1936 through 1944, passed through various hands after Kempner's death at age 93 in 1993, until they were reported to have been finally recovered by U.S. ICE agents in June 2013. Rosenberg's diary is now in the possession of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum for examination. Personal life Kempner was married to Ruth Kempner with two sons, Lucian and Andr√©, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. In 1993, at age 93, Kempner died in Frankfurt, Germany, where he practiced law. His wife, Ruth, died in 1983. Kempner was buried in Berlin.

This film is an adaptation of the Frank Harris semi-autobiographical novel My Reminiscences as a Cowboy. Lemmon's character is based on Harris. The opening animated title sequence was created by Saul Bass. The screenwriters were Edmund H. North and Dalton Trumbo, who received no screen credit at the time because he had been blacklisted as one of the Hollywood Ten. Plot Frank Harris is a Chicago hotel clerk who dreams of making his fortune in the cattle business and has fallen in love with Maria, the daughter of hotel guest and Mexican cattle baron Se√±or Vidal. When Se√±or Vidal finds out about the relationship, he orders Harris to stay away and arranges to return immediately to Mexico with his daughter. Tom Reece finishes his cattle drive and takes over an entire wing of the hotel, as usual. He makes a deal to buy cattle from Vidal in Mexico. However, when Reece loses his money in a poker game, Harris sees his opportunity to better himself (and see Maria again) - he offers his entire life savings for a partnership in Reece's next drive, including his joining the drive. Reece in desperation accepts. The next morning, when Harris shows up, Reece tries to renege, not wanting to burden himself with an inexperienced greenhorn as a partner, but Harris holds him to their deal. As they travel to Vidal's ranch, the cowboy life on the trail is not what Harris had envisioned. Harris is upset when one of the hands is killed by a rattlesnake bite during some fooling around by two other hands. Reece, still upset about having Harris along, continues to treat him harshly, but Harris toughens up and Reece starts taking a liking to him. When they reach their destination, Harris is devastated to learn that Maria has been married off by her father to Don Manuel Arriega. When Arriega sees them together, he warns Harris to keep away. During a fiesta, Arriega performs a dangerous stunt, placing a ring on a bull's horn from his horse, and challenges the Americans to do the same. Harris takes up his challenge, but Reece intercedes to protect Harris from himself. Reece confronts the bull on foot so as not to endanger his horse. On the cattle drive back to Chicago, Maria's marriage eats away at Harris. He becomes as callous and hostile to others as Reece had previously been to him. At one point, Reece stampedes the herd in order to save Harris from a Comanche ambush while he is out alone rounding up strays. Reece is shot in the leg, and Harris takes over as trail boss while he recovers. Harris tells Reece that the 200 head of cattle that were lost are all coming out of Reece's share. Harris drives the men hard. Reece offers advice, but Harris refuses to listen. When one of the hands, a former US marshal, kills one of his friends while drinking together and then takes his own life, Harris callously orders the men back to work. Later Reece saves Harris's life after he foolishly enters a crowded cattle car on the train. Harris snaps out of it and suggests that the lost cattle be shared 50/50. At the end of the drive, they boisterously take over part of the hotel where Harris used to work, much to the surprise of his former boss. CastDVD release The film was released on DVD in Region 1 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on May 14, 2002. Award nominations Al Clark and William A. Lyon were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing in 1958, while Daves was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures.

Widely known as Kupat Holim Clalit, it was established in 1911 as a mutual aid society. When the State of Israel was founded in 1948, Clalit was instrumental in providing medical care for the massive influx of new immigrants. Today, it is the largest provider of public and semi-private health services in Israel. Under Israeli law, it is run as a not-for-profit entity. History The foundations for Kupat Holim Clalit were laid by the Judea Workers' Health Fund, established at a convention of the Federation of Workers in Judea in December 1911.The Workers' Health Fund in Eretz Israel: Kupat Holim, 1911-1937, Shifra Shvarts Historically, Clalit was affiliated with the Histadrut labor movement. To be a member of Clalit, one had to join the Histadrut. The name \\"Clalit\\" means \\"general\\" in Hebrew and derives from the Histadrut's full name ‚Äì HaHistadrut HaKlalit shel HaOvdim B'Eretz Yisrael (lit. \\"The General Federation of Laborers in the Land of Israel\\"). In January 1995, Israel's national health insurance law went into effect, creating a compulsory health care system based on four service providers: Clalit, Leumit, Maccabi, and Meuhedet. Clalit is the largest of the four health funds with around 4.6 million insured members, representing slightly over half of the Israeli population in 2020. Since the 1995 law went into effect, membership has been open to all citizens and its tie to the Histadrut has been severed. Services Clalit runs its own network of hospitals in Israel (although it provides services, especially emergency care, for members of the other national health funds as well). It operates 14 hospitals, including psychiatric hospitals and a rehabilitation hospital, all of them university- affiliated. The Story of Clalit Health Services Clalit runs over 1,300 primary care clinics as well as a network of pharmacies and dental clinics. It was an early adopter of Health information technology with substantial investment in Electronic health records. In 2015 nearly 60% of its pediatric consultations took place over smartphones.

He served in various capacities at the convents that he served like being a janitor or a cook for his fellow religious though his cancer never limited his work for others. His beatification was held on 30 September 1984. Life Isidore De Loor was born on 18 April 1881 in East Flanders in Belgium as the oldest of three children to Alo√Øs De Loor and Kamilla Hutsebaut. His parents were devout and had been married since 1879. He received his Confirmation and his First Communion in 1894. His education at the local school came to an end in 1893 and from then on he joined his father in working on their farm. He grew up to be a devout and hard-working individual and often thought of following a vocation to the religious life. He was present among the Redemptorist priests at a mission and there discussed the matter of his vocation with a priest who advised him to join the Passionists. On 15 April 1907 he set off for the Passionist convent at Ere. It was there that the French language was spoken and the Dutch-speaking De Loor found it quite difficult to navigate a path to the convent. He was reserved and kept to himself but soon put himself to work and he impressed his superiors with his strong will and strong determination. On 8 September 1907 he received the religious habit and also received the religious name of \\"Isidore of Saint Joseph\\". The novitiate followed this during which he became an example to his fellow novices who were impressed with his happiness and his charitable disposition. On 13 September 1908 he professed his solemn vows. De Loor was transferred after his profession to the convent at Kortrijk on 11 August 1912 where he was put to work both as a gardener and as a cook. Despite suffering with a painful tumour that had a partial effect on his sight he was reluctant to complain about it; cancer was diagnosed and his right eye was removed in June 1911. The cancer had spread soon and he was given a short time left to live. He then served as porter of the convent not long thereafter in 1914. But as World War I took its toll on Belgium more and more visitors prevailed upon the convent for help and he was more than willing to offer his assistance. In late summer 1916 his health worsened and the cancer had spread to his intestines while that September it spread to his bowels. He asked the permission of his superior to die in peace and he died in the night from the violent pains of his cancer and pleurisy on 6 October 1916. He experienced his final pain in a chair with his face in his hands unable to bear the great pain. His remains were exhumed in 1952 and reinterred in his old convent where he had died. Beatification De Loor's beatification process opened under Pope John XXIII on 9 November 1960 and he became titled as a Servant of God while Pope John Paul II named him as Venerable on 12 July 1982 after confirming his life of model heroic virtue. The same pope beatified De Loor later on 30 September 1984. The current postulator for this cause is the Passionist priest Giovanni Zubiani.

The field will be completed in three phases and will include approximately 60 wells; phase one of the project includes 37 wells; 30 production wells and 7 water injection wells. The temperature of the oil, gas, water and sand from the field is 79.6¬∞C in the reservoir and 60-66¬∞C on arrival in the ship, and then heated to 130-150¬∞C for processing (separation). After this, the temperature is kept at 65-70¬∞C to keep the oil liquid. Development The field was originally planned to be operated by Anadarko Petroleum with Statoil as 50%; however, on March 4, 2008, Statoil purchased Anadarko's 50% share of the oil field for US$1.8 billion. At the time of acquiring the license, the field's recovery factor was estimated to be 9%. However, with the current reservoir depletion plan of the field calling for the use of produced water injection and rock compaction, Peregrino's recovery factor has increased to 20%. On 21 May 2010, Statoil agreed to sell 40% stake to Sinochem. The first phase of the development includes two drilling and wellhead platforms and a ship-shaped floating production, storage and off-take unit (FPSO) called Maersk Peregrino built in Singapore. It is 345m long, cost 1B euros and is powered by 72 MW steam turbines fueled by gas from the field.Andersen, Kasper Br√∏ndgaard. Maersk Peregrino (in Danish) Ing.dk, 22 November 2010. Functional drawings Retrieved: 22 November 2010. The platforms are tied back to the FPSO by flowlines and power umbilicals. Project requires extensive sub-surface and reservoir management skills such as produced water injection, horizontal wells and flow assurance to sustain the project over a longer-term. With the current reservoir depletion plan of the field calling for the use of produced water injection and rock compaction, Peregrino's recovery factor has increased to 20%. Contractors The project commenced in February 2007, when South Atlantic Holding and Maersk Contractors signed an agreement to perform a FEED study for the project. Shortly after the FEED, a contract was awarded to Maersk Contractors (now Maersk FPSOs) for the provision of the FPSO and for 15 years of operation of the FPSO.

Monastir Province was an Ottoman vilayet, created in 1864, encompassing territories in present-day Albania, Macedonia (one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, from which it declared independence in 1991) and Greece. On March 11, 1943, the Sephardic Jewish community of Monastir, historically the largest Jewish community in Macedonia was deported. The Jews who trace their ancestry to the Macedonian city known since 1913 as Bitola continue to call the city by the name it bore during centuries of Ottoman rule: Monastir.http://www.jewishcommunitybitola.mk Between 1941 and 1944, Bulgaria, in alliance with Nazi Germany, occupied the Yugoslav province of Macedonia. On March 11, 1943, in cooperation with the Germans, Bulgarian military and police officials rounded up 3,276 of Monastir's Jewish men, women, and children, deported them to German-controlled territory and turned them over to the custody of German officials. The Germans transported the Jewish population of Monastir and environs to their deaths in Treblinka as part of their plan to murder all European Jews. Monastir Jews before World War II Although Jews had lived in Monastir from Roman times, the Sephardic Jews, who originally migrated from the Iberian Peninsula in the fifteenth century, became the predominant group in the town by the sixteenth century. They maintained a highly traditional and distinctive lifestyle characterized by residence in a Jewish quarter, attachment to the Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) language and Sephardic folklore, commitment to Jewish religious observance, and allegiance to Jewish communal institutions including synagogues, religious schools, religious courts, and mutual aid societies. In 1863, after a fire destroyed much of the Jewish quarter, the community turned to the Jewish world's leading philanthropist, England's Sir Moses Montefiore, for assistance in reconstruction. This appeal to the West marked the beginning of the Sephardic community's reorientation toward European culture and the gradual introduction of secular education and values into the population. These changes took place at the same time as new transportation links to Salonika expanded trade and brought economic prosperity to the Monastir Jewish community.http://www.jewishcommunitybitola.mk This period of cultural and economic development was cut short by political upheavals in the region, beginning in 1903 with the Macedonian rebellion against the Turkish rulers of the Ottoman Empire. Ethnic violence among Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians over the future of Macedonia exposed Monastir to political violence and economic disruption throughout the first decade of the twentieth century. As a result, thousands of Jewish Monastirlis (as the locals referred to themselves) emigrated to North and South America, Jerusalem, and the Sephardic metropolis of Salonika. After the end of the Second Balkan War in 1913, formerly Ottoman Macedonia was carved up among Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece. Monastir, then renamed Bitola, was in the territory incorporated by Serbia. However, the Jewish community continued to call the city by the name it bore during centuries of Ottoman rule: Monastir.http://www.jewishcommunitybitola.mk At the turn of the twentieth century, Monastir's Jewish population reached nearly 11,000, but by 1914 years of emigration had reduced the community to just over 6,000. During World War I, Monastir suffered two invasions and two years of bombardment. More than 5,000 Monastir Jews fled their homes and lived as refugees in the surrounding area. When the war was over, Monastir's Jews numbered just over 3,000. Bitola became part of the new state of Yugoslavia, and in the 1920s and 1930s Zionism emerged as the dominant force among the local Jewish youth. During those years, 500 of these young men and women emigrated to Palestine. Monastir during the Holocaust In 1941, some 78,000 Jews lived in Yugoslavia, including about 4,000 foreign or stateless Jews who had found refuge in the country during the 1930s. Although Yugoslavia had reluctantly joined the Axis alliance with Germany, the Yugoslav government was toppled by an anti-German military coup on March 27, 1941. Nazi Germany invaded the Balkan nations of Yugoslavia and Greece in early April 1941. Supported militarily by her Axis allies (Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania), Germany quickly subdued the Balkans. Yugoslavia was partitioned among the Axis allies. Bulgaria annexed Yugoslav Macedonia (the area including the cities of Skopje and Bitola in southern Yugoslavia)http://www.jewishcommunitybitola.mk. On October 4, 1941, the Bulgarians enforced an extraordinary measure that prohibited the Jews of Macedonia from engaging in any type of industry or commerce. All existing Jewish businesses had three months to transfer ownership to non-Jews or sell their assets and close down. In addition, a law that barred Jews from certain areas of town was enforced in Monastir in late 1941. Jews who lived in the more prosperous part of Monastir, located on the east side of the Dragor River, were forced to move to a poorer part of town located near the traditional Jewish quarter on the west side, and this area became the ghetto. With Monastir's Jews forced into a ghetto and registered, it became easier to carry out the theft of their property. On July 2, 1942, the Bulgarian government demanded that all Jewish households hand over 20 percent of the value of all assets, including property, furniture, cash, and household items. Committees were established to assess the value of the Jews' property. The possessions of those who did not have the money to pay the tax were sold at auction. All of these degrading, restrictive measures halted normal Jewish life in Monastir. Zamila Kolonomos, a local Jewish woman, lived through these years of occupation in Monastir. She wrote, \\"Ansina la vida si truko i no avia mas ni enkontros, ni fiestar, ni bodas, ni aligrias\\" (Thus life was so greatly changed and there were no more get-togethers, no festivals, no weddings, no celebrations). Though allied with the Germans, the Bulgarian government refused to deport Jews residing in Bulgaria proper. Bulgarian authorities did, however, deport Jews without Bulgarian citizenship from the territories of Yugoslavia and Greece which Bulgaria occupied. They deported the Macedonian Jews in simultaneous actions that began in the early morning of Thursday, March 11, 1943. In Monastir, Skopje, and ≈†tip, where there was a tiny population of Sephardic Jews, several hundred police and soldiers, as well as cart drivers with their carts, gathered at municipal police stations at 2 a.m. to receive instructions for the removal of the Jews and their belongings. In Monastir, the Bulgarian military established a blockade around the city to prevent escapes. Between 5 and 6 a.m., groups fanned out into the ghetto to bang on doors and order the residents to leave their homes in one hour. The Jews were told that they were being transferred to other parts of Bulgaria and that after the war they would be returned to their homes, but this did little to ease the terror and confusion of this massive eviction. Advance rumors of this action convinced Kolonomos to hide, and that night she and four others sat in a windowless room in a shop and listened to what was happening to their community. Kolonomos wrote, > At dawn we heard the uproar of groups of police. In a moment there was the > sound of horses' footsteps and the noise of carts. Then all was calm. Then > came a noise like thunder‚Ä¶.We asked each other what it could be? Then we > were able to discern the sound of voices, shouts, the crying of many people, > of babies, of women! We were able to distinguish the words of the Bulgarians > who shouted: 'Quickly! Quickly!' The prayers, moans, curses, the crying was > clear‚Ä¶ They were taking all the Jews, old and young, not just the youths who > could work‚Ä¶. A river of people passed alongside us. At around 7 a.m. the Jews were forced to walk to the railroad station, where a train was waiting to take them away to neighboring Skopje; a temporary detention center had been established at the state tobacco monopoly warehouse known as Monopol. The Monopol was chosen for its ability to hold thousands of people, and also because it was served by a railroad. Albert Sarfati survived the war, and he gave this eyewitness account: > They loaded us into cattle wagons, fifty to sixty people per wagon, > including luggage. There wasn't enough space and many had to stand. There > was no water. The children were crying ‚Ä¶ A woman in one wagon was giving > birth‚Ä¶ but there was no doctor. We reached Skopje at midnight. Night. > Darkness. They opened the wagons and in the darkness pushed us into two > large buildings. Cars carrying the Jews from Shtip had been added to our > train. Stumbling over one another in the darkness, dragging our luggage and > continuously being beaten by the Bulgarian soldiers, the children, the aged > and infirm tried to squeeze into the building. When the sun rose, we > realized we were in Skopje in the building of the Monopoly, and that all the > Jews of Macedonia had been rounded up that same day. For the next 11 days the Monastir Jews, together with Jews from Skopje and ≈†tip, approximately 7,215 in all, lived in crowded, filthy conditions in four warehouses at Monopol. The weather was cold, there was little food and few blankets, and the Jews were continually searched, beaten, and humiliated. Women and girls were raped. Elena Leon Ishakh, a doctor from Monastir who was released from Monopol to work for the Bulgarians, survived the war and left this description of the Monopol: > Hunger pervaded‚Ä¶ Only on the fifth day did the camp authorities set up a > kitchen, but for over 7,000 of us there were too few stoves. Food was doled > out starting at eleven in the morning, and the last ones were fed around > five in the evening. Food was distributed once daily and consisted of 250 > grams of bread and plain, watery beans or rice... They also gave us smoked > meat, but it was so bad that, despite our hunger, we couldn't eat it... > Under the pretext of searching us to find hidden money, gold, or foreign > currency, they sadistically forced us to undress entirely... In some cases > they even took away baby diapers... If anything was found on somebody, he > was beaten‚Ä¶. Nico Pardo was one of the few who managed to escape from the Skopje detention center and after the war he described the Jews' despair in Monopol: > We were in a terrible mood. The youngsters tried to sing every so often, but > the adults and the elderly people were in deep depression. We did not know > what awaited us, but the dreadful treatment we received from the Bulgarians > showed the value of the promises given us that we would only be taken to a > Bulgarian work camp. Here and there youngsters whispered of the possibility > of an uprising and a mass escape, but they never materialized. There was no > prospect of it succeeding. The yard was surrounded by a wooden fence and > behind that a barbed wire fence. At each of the four corners there was a > sentry with a machine gun and other armed guards would patrol the yard. > Also, the belief that the worst possible fate did not await us prevented > such suicidal acts from taking place. Three railroad transports took the Macedonian Jews from Monopol to Treblinka. The journey typically took six days, and during this time the Jews were locked in cattle or freight cars. Several Jews died during each transport, and the living had to endure the presence of corpses. On the morning of March 22, 1943, some 2,300 Macedonian Jews from Monopol were forced to board a train consisting of 40 cattle cars. Families journeyed together, and the transport included at least 134 small children no more than four years old, and at least 194 children between the ages of four and 10. The train arrived at Treblinka six days later on March 28 at 7 a.m. Four people died on this transport. The overwhelming majority of these Jews were from Skopje. On March 25, German and Bulgarian soldiers loaded about 2,400 Macedonian Jews onto a train made up of freight cars. All the Jews from ≈†tip, who numbered 551, were on this second transport, as were about 2,000 Jews from Skopje and Monastir. Sarfati was scheduled to board the third transport, and he watched the Jews board this second train: > Each wagon carried between 60 and 70 people with all their baggage. The > people came out of the building carrying their belongings on their backs. > Everyone was carrying things, from the oldest person to the youngest. With > bowed heads, all approached the black train. In front of each wagon stood a > German and a Bulgarian policeman checking off a list. It was impossible to > sit down in the freight cars. As soon as the 'livestock' had been loaded > into a car, it was locked and sealed. Only heads were visible through the > small windows... Those of us in the building were not permitted to watch, > and the police waved their machine guns toward our windows to keep us from > watching. The train was ready and left about eleven o'clock. Hands were > waving goodbye from the small wagon windows and all of us in the building > were shedding tears. The last train carried around 2,400 Jews, approximately 2,300 of whom were from Monastir. The Jews began boarding the freight cars at 6 a.m. on March 29 and by noon the train was full. The departure of this train for the killing center at Treblinka signaled the final destruction of the Monastir Jewish community. The Monastir photograph collection Jewish cemetery in Bitola Photographs of nearly every Jewish adult in Monastir, more than half the community, were collected by the Bulgarian authorities in the first half of 1942. Though many of the Jewish inhabitants of eastern Europe were required to submit photographs for purposes of police registration, work permits, and ration cards both inside and outside ghettos established by Germany or its Axis allies, few of these photograph collections survived the war intact. The Monastir registration photographs constitute one of these rare collections The origins of the Monastir photograph collection lay in the directive given by the Bulgarian occupation authorities in early 1942 to the Jews of Monastir, then recently concentrated in a ghetto, to submit photographs of all family members above the age of 13. While some of the submitted photos were newly taken for this purpose, others were older family snapshots dating from the 1890s to the early 1940s. Most of the photographs are head shots of individual adults, but some are group portraits of two, three, or more family members. Apparently, these photographs were reproduced by the Bulgarian authorities; one complete set now exists at the Macedonian State Archives, captioned in the 1950s, while another set was cut and pasted into police register books produced by the Bulgarian authorities in 1942. These police registers were recovered after the war and turned over to the Union of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia. Years later they were donated to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, but not before a large percentage of the photos were removed by survivors. The photographs are currently available at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum http://www.jewishcommunitybitola.mk.

It is located west of Ottawa, and was founded in . Although the resort is named after the nearby community of Calabogie and Calabogie Lake, the mountain itself is actually called Dicksons Mountain. Calabogie Peaks Resort offers the highest vertical drop among public ski hills in Ontario, . In addition to the beginner hill, Calabogie offers the longest beginner trail in Ontario, as well as plenty of intermediate and expert runs. Resort facilities The resort features 2 chairlifts and 1 carpet lift. As of 2016, there were 24 trails recorded, all of which are historically named after Calabogie. The resort consists of 3 levels of difficulty for runs: beginner, intermediate and expert. In 2016, it was documented the mountain consisted of 30% beginner runs, 45% intermediate runs, and 25% expert runs. The longest run as of 2016 was recorded to be 2.1 km long. In 2016, the Top Hut was introduced to provide a shelter for guests at the top of the mountain. In the winter, the Top Hut provides guest with warmth from a wood stove, while in the summer the Top Hut provides guests with shelter from the sun. Seasonal Activities Calabogie Peaks offers year- round activities to bring in tourists from all areas. Summer activities at the Peaks include bike trails, hiking trails, the beach front, boat rentals, the Boathouse Bar & Grill, a 9-hole golf course, chair-lift rides up the mountain on October weekends for fall colours, as well as annual festivals. During the summer, the Calabogie Peaks hosts the Blues & Ribs Fest as well as the Mountain Man Music Festival. Both events occur within the July and August months. In the past, the Calabogie Peaks also hosted the Wake Surf nationals.

He is portrayed by actor Tim Daly.Private Practice at The Futon Critic Character history= Season One  Pete works at the Oceanside Wellness Center as a naturopathic doctor and licensed herbalist. He graduated from medical school and practiced traditional western medicine for a number of years before spending five years in China studying alternative medicine. Pete‚Äôs medical practice combines eastern and western medicine in an integrative approach, and he is often asked to provide expectant mothers with holistic birthing plans. Pete has also lectured locally and internationally on the subject of Oriental and Eastern Medicine. During Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery's first visit to Oceanside Wellness, Pete and Addison establish a teasing and often flirtatious relationship. Addison initially labels Pete a ‚Äúquack,‚Äù but she allows the ‚Äúcute hippy boy‚Äù to treat her with acupuncture. Although Pete is immediately attracted to her, he promises their mutual friend, Dr. Sam Bennett, that he will stay away from Addison. However, after finding Addison crying over her newly discovered infertility, Pete kisses her to prove that she isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdried up.‚Äù Addison seems open to pursuing a relationship with Pete, but is warned off by Sam. According to Sam, Pete is a serial monogamist, unable to emotionally connect with any woman since the death of his wife. Pete's last foray into office romance was apparently disastrous, and resulted in the unnamed OB/GYN's sudden departure from the practice. In response, Oceanside Wellness instituted a strict \\"no consorting\\" rule. Pete's relationship with his wife is somewhat mysterious and he appears reluctant to discuss their marriage. During a visit to her grave on the anniversary of her death, we discover Anna Wilder died in 2001, at the age of 40. (In \\"The Other Side of This Life,\\" Sam stated that Pete‚Äôs wife had died eight years prior. However, in a subsequent interview, Tim Daly said that there is some confusion as to whether Anna died six or eight years prior, which was finally decided to be six years prior.) In a discussion regarding a patient, Pete hints to the other doctors that he stayed in an unhappy marriage because his wife was sick, and that they were unable to make the marriage work. Pete eventually tells Addison that he went to bed with his wife on a Tuesday night and when he awoke the following Wednesday morning, she was dead. He further states that no night was perfect during their marriage, not even their wedding night. This information was the most that Pete has ever divulged to any of his co-workers about his wife. During a second visit to his wife's grave, Pete unleashes his pent-up anger to his wife's headstone. After stating that Anna was \\"a mean, cold bitch\\" and that he hated her, Pete softens and apologizes for not being able to save her. Pete later reveals to Violet that at the time of Anna's death, they had been trying to conceive a child.  Season Two  In the fourth episode, a mysterious woman from Pete's past appears in the clinic and reveals surprising facts about his past. Meg Porter (played by Jayne Brook) is a Doctors Without Borders physician and Pete's former lover. They met when they were both residents and later worked together with Doctors Without Borders. Meg reveals to Pete's surprised co-workers that once, during the war in Bosnia, Pete (whom Meg calls Peter) refused to evacuate and, despite the mortar fire, stayed with sick children for the whole night saving the lives of most of them. Later Pete told Meg, who has a smoking habit, that his wife was a smoker and she didn't quit the habit before she died. Despite their renewed relationship, Meg decides to go back to Ghana, where she works in an anti-malaria program, but Pete asked her to come back to him because she makes him happy. Meg returned later to L.A. and even tried to give up smoking for Pete, but despite that, the relationship didn't work. Meg wasn't sure if she wanted to live in L.A., and Pete admitted that ever since his unhappy marriage he doesn't trust women anymore. When Pete and his Oceanside Wellness Center colleague Violet hooked-up, the relationship with Meg was definitely over. The relationship with Violet started with just sex, but Pete later realized that he wanted more. When he asked Violet if they could move to the next level and begin a real relationship, she turned him down, saying she doesn't trust him because of his past. But it was Violet's behavior that really put an end to things when she started secretly dating Sheldon, the therapist from the rival practice, The Pacific Wellcare. Pete ended their relationship because of Violet's infidelity. Afterward, Violet reveals to both Pete and Sheldon she's pregnant, and was willing to raise the child, but preferred to ignore who the father is. In the Season Two finale, Pete confronts Violet and says that he loves her and they could be a real family. Violet turns him down, but later she kisses him and confesses her feelings towards him. In the end, Violet's patient, Katie, thinks Violet's baby is her own. Katie kidnaps Violet's baby, ending the finale as a cliffhanger.  Season Three  Season Three starts just twenty minutes after the Season Two finale, when Pete finds Violet lying unconscious on the floor of her house, bleeding to death. Katie cut the baby out of Violet and ran away with him. Pete saves Violet and, together with Naomi, rushes her to hospital, where Addison and Naomi perform surgery on her. In the meantime, Katie appears in the hospital with Violet's baby, and is apprehended by Pete, Cooper, and the security team. While waiting in the hospital during Violet's surgery, Pete thinks back to their first meeting. They met just four days after Pete's wife death when Sam and Naomi, Pete's friends who had just opened their private practice, recommended that Pete see Violet for therapy. Pete at first was reluctant to talk with Violet, but he finally opened up to her and admitted that he hated his wife and argued with her all the time, even the night she died. The next morning, he continued yelling at her when he woke up and only a few minutes later he noticed that she wasn't answering because she was dead. Pete admitted that he was relieved after his wife's death and felt free. After that. Pete, who owned an Infectious Diseases practice in Beverly Hills, decided to change his job, and started working in Oceanside Wellness Centre as an Alternative Medicine specialist, where he still works eight years later. A month after the Season Three premiere, Violet is still trying to recover and get over her trauma. Pete lives with her and takes care of her and the baby, Lucas. Violet is not leaving her house and has panic attacks every time the doorbell rings. After getting advice from Sheldon, Pete decides to move out, to help Violet recover and push her to go outside. Violet realizes that after the traumatic events in her life, she can't bond with her baby. She gives Lucas to Pete to care for. A couple of weeks later, Sheldon requests a paternity test and it is revealed that Pete is the biological father. Pete continues to be a single father and takes care of Lucas, hoping that some day Violet will come back to him and be able to bond with their child. To give Violet more space and time to recover, Pete decided to leave his job in Oceanside Wellness and accept Naomi's offer to work as physician in Pacific Wellcare. When Pete found out that Violet slept with Addison's father, he was so hurt, that he declared it the definite end of their relationship. Later on Pete forgave Violet, but she still wasn't ready to move on and re-unite with Pete and their son, Lucas, who was already 6 months old. After that Pete and Addison started a \\"friends with benefits\\" relationship together. Pete and Addison eventually took their relationship further, becoming a real couple. They pursued this even after Violet had returned and was ready for a real relationship with Pete and Lucas. In the Season Three finale, Addison tells Pete that he should be with Violet, and he seems to initiate a newfound relationship with Violet again.  Season Four  In the Season Four premiere, Pete popped the question to Violet after a morning of passion. The wedding was set for the following weekend. Violet bolted from the ceremony halfway down the aisle, but was wordlessly convinced by Pete to come back and the two were wed. In the Season Four finale, Violet finds out that her license is being suspended and Pete tells her that maybe they should split. The final scene of Season Four shows Pete, alone with Lucas, having a heart attack with no one around to help him.  Season Five  No one is around to help Pete. Cooper arrives and finds him unconscious. He's rushed to the hospital where Sam and Amelia work to save his life. Violet returns shocked at what has happened. Pete has an emergency quadruple bypass. Amelia operates on him under the influence. The surgery is a success. Afterwards, everything seems fine between Violet and Pete until Pete begins lashing out at Violet and she becomes his verbal punching bag and he offers her no support as she struggles to return to the practice. Sheldon becomes Pete's unofficial therapist. Pete begins treating Violet as though he hates her. Sheldon warns him that he will lose her and Lucas if he continues this behavior. Violet and Pete try to make it work but Violet doesn't want him to hate her as he did hate his deceased wife. The two agree to amicably separate.  Season Six  In the season premiere Violet is left wondering where Pete is as his court date has arrived and he was not there. Throughout the episode Violet and the rest of the practice debate whether he has fallen into some trouble or he decided to make a run for it. The only clue available is a text message from Pete to Violet stating, \\"Went for a run. Whatever happens... know that I LOVE YOU!\\" Speculation flies as Violet considers whether Pete meant a jog or a flight out of the country. In the last minutes of the episode it is revealed by Violet in a conversation with Cooper that police have informed her Pete had fallen off a hill while on a run and suffered a fatal heart attack. Since he was out of immediate sight help was not able to arrive on time and he died. Violet is in shock, stating she could hardly believe it was Pete and she did not know how to break the news to their three-year-old son. Per his will, Pete's body is cremated and he insists on a party rather than a funeral. At the event, Violet hears various people talk of how Pete saved their lives or helped family members, Violet having a difficult time dealing with it, including getting high in the bathroom. She tries to celebrate with singing but breaks down to scream over Pete leaving her and their son alone.

Dr. Chen, Councillor of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and former Education Minister, received her honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Nottingham in 2003. Professor Yang Fujia has been appointed sixth Chancellor of the university. The university admitted its first students in 2004 for Arts and Social Science subjects. The 146 acre (591,333m¬≤) campus was launched on 6 September 2005 by British Prime Minister Tony Blair from Beijing in a broadcast for China Central Television. It was officially opened on 23 February 2006 by British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, in the presence of Chinese education minister Zhou Ji and State Counsellor Chen Zhili. The President of the University is Professor Yang Fujia, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and former President of Fudan University. At the end of 2012, the British Higher Education Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) went to the University of Nottingham Ningbo China for quality assessment. In May 2013, QAA officially released the Quality Assessment report on the university and concluded that the academic level of University of Nottingham Ningbo China and the quality of students were consistent with the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom.https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AE%81%E6%B3%A2%E8%AF%BA%E4%B8%81%E6%B1%89%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/2027913?fr=aladdin On 9 June 2018, Michele Geraci, an Assistant Professor of Finance at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) has been appointed to a top position in the Italian government. At a ceremony in Rome, Michele Geraci was sworn-in by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte as Under-Secretary for Economic Development in the newly formed government, a rank below ministry. In 2018, Stephen Morgan, who served as Nottingham Ningbo's associate provost since 2016, was removed from its management board for criticizing the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and being a critic of broader party-backed initiatives in the university, but remained on the faculty. Campus The University is situated within the Ningbo Higher Education Park on the outskirts of the city under the jurisdiction of Yinzhou District, Ningbo. The 900 mu (60 hectares or 150 acres) campus features Chinese and English gardens, lakes, sports centre, student residencies, library, academic and administration buildings, staff accommodation and a high street for a range of shops, restaurants and coffee outlets (including, allegedly the first Starbucks branch on a mainland China campus). The Centre for Sustainable Energy Technologies (CSET) which opened in September 2008 is the site of China's first zero-carbon building and provides laboratory facilities as well as offices and seminar accommodation. In 2011, the University opened its new Science and Engineering Building, equipped with laboratories, auditoriums and offices for the researchers and lecturers. 2015 saw the launch of the GB6M Ningbo New Materials Institute within the City's HiTech Zone - developing new solutions for energy conversion, soil mechanics and composite materials.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/nmi/index.aspx In 2016 the Lord Dearing Building was opened - a state of the art flexible learning space with tiered lecture halls and high tech, small group teaching spaces. The same year, HMA Dame Barbara Woodward opened the DH Lawrence Auditorium, a 996-seater venue for performance, graduation events and other celebrations. A second International Conference Centre was added the same year. Research facilities were expanded once more in 2017 with the opening of the 13,000m2 Sir David and Lady Susan Greenaway building, housing amongst other things the International Academy for Marine Economy and Technology and UNNC's first business incubator.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/about/ningbo- nottingham-international-incubator-park/index.aspx Structure=Academic leaders The University is led by Professor Fujia Yang, former Chancellor of The University of Nottingham, Professor Shearer West , Vice-Chancellor of The University of Nottingham and Professor Nick Miles, Provost of The University of Nottingham Ningbo China and Pro-Vice Chancellor of The University of Nottingham UK. Nick Miles succeeded the previous Provost, Professor Chris Rudd OBE in February 2019.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/about/university- management/management.aspx Rudd was recognised in the Queen's 2018 New Year Honours list where he was appointed an OBE for his work in higher education and UK-China relations. Academic departments The University is divided into three faculties: =Faculty of Science and Engineering (FoSE)= Within the Faculty of Science and Engineering are: * School of Aerospace * Department of Architecture and Built Environmenthttps://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/science- engineering/departments/architecture-built-environment/index.aspx * Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineeringhttps://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/science- engineering/departments/chemical-environmental/index.aspx * Department of Chemistry * Department of Civil Engineering * Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering * School of Geographical Sciences. * Department of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering * School of Mathematical Sciences * School of Computer Science =Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences (FHSS)= The Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences includes 5 Schools and a language department:https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/humanities- and-social-sciences/home/home.aspx * School of International Studies * School of Economics * School of Education * School of English * School of International Communications * Language Centre =Faculty of Business (FOB)= The FOB has one school: * Nottingham University Business School China (NUBS China) Outside of the faculty structure the Graduate School supports postgraduate students and early career researchers. To support the academic output of the University, administrative departments are managed centrally overseen ultimately by the provost. Teaching All undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the China campus are conducted entirely in English with the same teaching and evaluation standards as at Nottingham UK by staff either seconded from Nottingham UK or appointed internationally to the University of Nottingham standards. Consistent with the UK campus, University of Nottingham Ningbo China shares the network and teaching resources from University of Nottingham UK, as well as its teaching model: small-classroom teaching, cooperative learning, cultivating students' ability of independent study, research and teamwork, content analysis and re-expression, and improving the ability of knowledge transformation.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/cn/about/a-british-education-in- china.aspx Visual technologies, including interactive whiteboards, simulations and video conferencing are widely used to support and enhance student learning. University of Nottingham Ningbo China also makes use of visual technology to set up direct links with their UK and Malaysia Campuses, and video conferencing to enable joint projects involving students from around the world.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/study/postgraduate/masters/how-will-i- study/innovative-teaching.aspx Activities=Programmes UNNC offers undergraduate degrees, masters programmes and PhD study. It recruits domestic Chinese students via Gaokao into 4-year undergraduate courses and international direct entry students from more than 50 countries. International students make up around 10% of the student population. UK students are the largest international grouping but there are also significant numbers from Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Mauritius and East European countries. Programmes are taught entirely in English and the entry standards and degree awards are identical to those in Nottingham UK. The entry standards to UNNC are relatively high - 2016/17 Gaokao entry score were on average 40 and 60 points above division 1 for the arts and science gaokao respectively. 2017 entry saw a further rise to 48 points above division 1 (Arts) and 73 points above (Science). Small group teaching is a particular feature of UNNC's delivery and this reflects strongly in annual teaching evaluations which. year on year, are consistently higher than its sister campuses. Partnerships and Agreements As well as establishing bilateral links with some 60 Chinese universities, The University of Nottingham has student exchange agreements and joint research projects with most of China's top universities. This includes institutions within the Universitas 21 alliance of leading international universities, such as Fudan and Shanghai Jiao Tong. The University of Nottingham signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Fudan University to create a 'Confucius Institute' in Nottingham in 2007. It is dedicated to the expansion of existing links with schools, business, government, community groups and the Chinese cultural community to promote the teaching of Chinese language and contemporary Chinese culture. The Confucius Institute will also promote academic links with Chinese universities and showcase contemporary Chinese popular art and media, including films, television programmes and the creative arts such as painting, photography, literature, music and the performing arts. In April 2016 the Nottingham-Fudan Confucius Institute opened a branch at UNNC. This is the first such CI to establish a presence in mainland China. The opening was attended by President Yang, Professor Sir David Greenaway and Hanban Director Madam Xu Lin. The University of Nottingham has teaching and research links with China in fields such as satellite technology, the environment, education and law. Nottingham has experienced an increase in its research activity with Chinese universities and has seen a huge increase in the number of Chinese students wishing to study in the UK. In addition to the Chinese students coming to Nottingham, more than 1,400 students from the UK and around the world are taking courses about on China. Around 250 undergraduate students each year transfer to Nottingham UK on 2+2 programs where they complete their studies. UNNC students perform especially strongly in STEM subjects and their degree results are generally higher than UK counterparts. More than 70% of UNNC graduates progress to further studies overseas, the majority to World top 50 Universities. 2016 saw 2 students progressing to MIT, 4 to Cambridge, 11 to Oxford, 58 to Imperial and 128 to UCL. Student Activities Student societies, organisations and activities in the University of Nottingham Ningbo China are supported by the Student Engagement Office (SEO). SEO sets out to enhance students' living experience through a variety of programs, activities and services. It is a direct response to students' expectations of proactive engagement both on campus and in local communities. It aims to cultivate a transparent, diverse and competitive environment, particularly with regards to extracurricular activities where students achieve success through their cumulated knowledge, teamwork and leadership skills.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/life/student- activity/seo-introduction/index.aspx The University of Nottingham Ningbo China has various organizations and societies, including 20 service-oriented student organizations, many student innovation teams, and more than 70 societies in four major categories including academic, practical, liberal arts and sports. The student organizations and societies are committed to conducting a variety of extra-curricular activities, strengthening the communication between the university and local community, and sharing global education experience and achievements, promoting the integration of domestic and international students, and enhancing the communication between teachers and students.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/life/student-activity/organization- club/organisationssocieties.aspx Sport Each year, the Tri Campus Games brings together students from the three University of Nottingham campuses (UK, China and Malaysia) to compete against each other in a week-long festival of sport. The event involves nearly 200 students from over 20 different nationalities. The games are a unique event within higher education, taking place at a different one of the University's international campuses each year. Underpinned by the ethos 'friendship through sport', the Games offer a fantastic opportunity for sporting and educational exchange in the friendly spirit of competition.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/life/sport/tri-campus- games.aspx Research and innovation The University of Nottingham Ningbo China is active in research and collaborates with China as well as internationally, particularly with The University of Nottingham UK. It aims at bringing the research expertise of The University of Nottingham UK to China. In 2017, the UNNC's PhD license, which was granted in 2007, was updated to allow the university to recruit 225 PhD students each year. The university's internationalized research is reflected in its bibliometrics indicators. Nottingham China's Field Weighted Citation Index for 2012-16 was ahead of prestigious Chinese institutions at 1.45 (Scival) and in several disciplines (Business, Economics, Engineering, Humanities, Social Sciences) leads the home institution. Currently, University of Nottingham Ningbo China's research institutes are: *Centre for Sustainable Energy Technologies (CSET) *Centre for Global Finance *Centre for Research in Applied Linguistics *Centre for Research on Globalisation and Economic Policy *Institute for Comparative Cultural Studies *Institute of Asia Pacific Studies (IAPS) *International Centre for Behavioural Business Research *International Finance Research Centre *Learning Science Research Centre *Nottingham Ningbo New Materials Institute *International Academy for the Marine Economy and Technology Cultural links The University has a scholarship programme with Hunan University and a joint appointment with the famous Tsinghua University in Beijing, focusing on international collaboration.

Honorary citizenships have also been bestowed upon Sir David Greenaway and former PVC Hai-Sui Yu. Economic development agencies within the United Kingdom are now based at the campus of The University of Nottingham Ningbo China. The City of Nottingham is twinned with the City of Ningbo, and there are well established cultural and community projects in both England and China. Welbeck Primary School in Nottingham has a link with Jiangdong Central Primary school in Ningbo, China, along with five other Nottingham schools. Students from Ningbo visiting the UK for study now undertake volunteering work within local schools helping to widen appreciation of Chinese culture and lifestyle. The University of Nottingham Ningbo China also develops relationships with partners globally in terms of world changing research, innovative teaching collaboration, international capacity building projects and exciting international projects. In 2017, it assisted the UK campus for the International Partnership Forum which generated fruitful results, since then, this has become an annual event which the university is expanding internationally.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/global/partnerships.aspx The university now works with around 109 University partners in countries around the world.https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/global/partners.aspx ReferencesExternal links The University of Nottingham campus links * University of Nottingham Ningbo China website * University of Nottingham Nottingham, UK website * University of Nottingham Semenyih, Malaysia website Nottingham University Business School (NUBS) links * NUBS, China website * NUBS, UK website * NUBS, Malaysia website Category:Educational institutions established in 2004 Category:Universities and colleges in Zhejiang Ningbo Category:Satellite campuses ","title":"University of Nottingham Ningbo China"},{"id":"12782544","text":"XXL was a gay nightclub in London and Birmingham which catered to the bear sub-group. The club was founded by Mark Ames and his then partner David Dindol in 2000. They separated in 2005, after which Mark purchased his ex-partner's share of the club. It was the largest dedicated \\"bear\\" venue in the United Kingdom and the world. It was not just the bear scene's longest-running weekly disco but London's too, having not missed a night in over 16 years. Between 2012 and 2019, XXL London was based at Pulse, which closed in September 2019 to make way for a future development of luxury apartments. There are currently no public plans for a future venue but it is understood that discussions are ongoing.  Venue  XXL was based at Pulse in Southwark, on the corner of Southwark Street and Blackfriars Road. Pulse was on the same street as the previous venue, Arcadia. Both consist of a number of railway arches. After Arcadia became unsafe due to a structural fault in the railway arches (which only affected the nightclub, but not the trains running above), XXL moved to Pulse in March 2012, one of the capital's largest entertainment venues that was developed and converted by Ames and his team.  History  Mark Ames created XXL as he felt disillusioned with how little there was for the London Bear Community outside of one bar in Soho. In 2003, XXL in London created Bear Necessities, now called XXL London Bear Pride, a weekend-long celebration of everything \\"big, gay and hairy\\" with events around the country. A year later this turned into London Bear Pride. In 2006 this was expanded to include the leather community in Bear and Leather Pride. The two subcultures do have a large overlap and a number of leather fetishists patronize XXL. XXL also operates internationally both in Europe and the US as well as a monthly night in the UK's second city Birmingham and has other events too. In 2014, XXL launched a monthly event in Glasgow. Opinion polls in magazines such as Gay Times, the Pink Paper and Boyz regularly put XXL in the top two night clubs in London. XXL was also the title sponsor of the 2006 Bingham Cup in New York. In 2007 the club expanded and also diversified the brand by launching new nights, extending its appeal far beyond the core audience. In 2009 Ames became the gay promoter of the year according to the London Boyz Magazine readers' poll and was named as a gay icon in London's QX magazine. In the 2017 Boyz Awards, XXL was voted best club, with two of the XXL DJs (Joe Egg and David Robson) appearing in the Top 10 most popular DJs. There were four resident DJs at XXL; Alex Logan (from 2004), Joe Egg (from 2007), David Robson (from 2015) and Paul Morrell (from 2016). Logan and Morrell play contemporary house and dance mixes with a tribal edge in the main room; occasionally joined by Mark Ames himself. Egg and Robson play an eclectic set of contemporary and retro pop, rock, indie, soul, R&B;, bashment and disco in the smaller room, known as 'The Fur Lounge'. In 2015 it was announced that regular guest DJs would play in the main room rotating on a monthly basis in between the weekly residents' sessions. These DJs are currently The Hoxton Whores (began residency 11 July 2015), Moto Blanco (beginning summer 2015), Fat Tony (from 2017) and Pagano, who first guested in the summer of 2016. In 2019 it was announced that XXL was being evicted from Pulse, as the building was being redeveloped into flats and a shopping mall, by the landlords, Native Land. The last XXL at Pulse was on Saturday 21 September 2019.  Criticisms  In June 2010 the UK gay press reported on comments written by Mark Ames on his Facebook page in which he stated that he would boycott Muslim businesses. He issued an unreserved apology. Ames caused controversy again in 2018 after a customer was turned away from XXL whilst wearing high heels. After responding to the controversy on Facebook, protests were organised in other LGBT venues.

Student enrollment is approximately 2,700. NOC bought the former Phillips University in Enid, Oklahoma in 1999, and has turned it into the NOC Enid campus. History The history of Northern Oklahoma College began in 1901 when the Honorable James Wilkin realized the need for a college in the Tonkawa, Oklahoma area. Thus, the sixth Territorial Legislature passed an appropriation bill on March 1, 1901 for the establishment of the University Preparatory School at Tonkawa. The doors opened to 217 students and 7 faculty. From 1913 to 1915, it was known as the Oklahoma Institute of Technology. The school closed during World War I from 1917 to 1919, when Governor Robert L. Williams vetoed the appropriation bill for the biennium. It reopened September 2, 1919, after Gov. James B. A. Robertson signed an appropriation bill for its reestablishment. College-level courses were added in 1921, the college was named Northern Oklahoma Junior College in 1941,Northern Oklahoma Course Catalog 2015-16 and the high school curriculum was phased out by 1951. The school was renamed Northern Oklahoma College in 1965. During the first two decades, the school served primarily as a \\"feeder\\" institution for the University of Oklahoma and paralleled the university curriculum of music, foreign languages, business, literature, and military science. In addition, the school served as a cultural center for the performing arts, a distinction that continues today with the 2006 dedication of the Kinzer Performing Arts Center. The school's first accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Universities was in 1948. With the passage of the Higher Education Code in 1965, the institution received its present name, Northern Oklahoma College, and the three-person Board of Regents was expanded to five members. Dr. Edwin E. Vineyard became the tenth president; he served for twenty-five years and retired as the college's president holding the longest tenure. During his administration the campus underwent an expansive building program. Dr. Joe M. Kinzer became president in 1990 upon the retirement of Dr. Vineyard. New campuses have opened in Enid (1999) and Stillwater (2003), further expanding the programs and enrollment of Northern. Northern is a leader among Oklahoma colleges in technological advances in developing multiple on-line and interactive television courses that serve students in rural and remote areas who could not otherwise attain a college degree. NOC is nationally recognized by the Aspen Institute in Washington DC as being in the top 10 percent of community colleges in the country. Cheryl Evans was named president in 2011. Locations Sunken Gardens at the Enid campus of Northern Oklahoma College Northern Oklahoma college consists of three campuses: *Tonkawa, Oklahoma 1220 East Grand *Enid, Oklahoma 100 South University Avenue *Stillwater, Oklahoma 1118 West Hall of Fame Tonkawa The Tonkawa campus, established in 1901, serves as administrative center for Northern with campuses in Tonkawa, Enid, and Stillwater. All program oversight in academic, financial, student service, personnel, development, physical plant, and information technology is housed in Tonkawa. Some 2,200 students attend class on campus, by ITV, via online, or at technology centers. The Tonkawa campus is the home of the Eleanor Hays Art Gallery, which hosts exhibits by Oklahoma artists throughout the academic year, located in the lobby of the 500-seat Kinzer Performing Arts Center, dedicated in 2006. It is also home to radio station KAYE-FM, the A. D. Buck Museum of Science and History, and the North Oklahoma Botanical Garden and Arboretum. Enid The Enid campus was established in 1999 in conjunction with the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) and the City of Enid. The facility had been the home of Phillips University, which had gone bankrupt in 1998. Since its purchase by NOC in 1999, this campus has grown in offering multiple two-year liberal arts degree programs to some 1,200 students each semester. Among the more popular degrees offered are Nursing, Business Administration, Education, Social Science, and Pre-Medicine. The College also has numerous cooperative degree programs in medical and electronic areas with Autry Technology Center the local career technology center. Northern Oklahoma College brings a complete college experience to Enid with varsity athletics, dorms, cultural events and more. The Enid campus continues to expand its faculty, curriculum, and clubs and activities to meet the needs of people in northwest Oklahoma. Stillwater The Stillwater campus, established in 2003, serves multiple missions to area students. Primarily a Gateway Program, the Stillwater campus serves students who would otherwise not be admitted to Oklahoma State University. The campus, however, also admits students seeking general education courses that transfer to other comprehensive colleges and universities. Northern Stillwater admits approximately 300 new Students each fall and spring semester, serving some 1,700 students. Athletics A view of the NOC Enid Campus Tonkawa Mavericks The Tonkawa campus has men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, baseball, softball and cheerleading teams. Northern Oklahoma College won the 1979 NJCAA Women's Basketball Championship, 74-52 against Tyler Junior College. The professional wrestler \\"The Big Show\\" played basketball for the Mavericks in 1990-1991 before transferring to Wichita State. NBA player John Starks played basketball for the Mavericks during one semester in the 1980s. Pitcher Clint Straka was drafted into the Seattle Mariners in 2006. After NOC, he played baseball for the University of Central Oklahoma, where he was named to the Third Team 2008 National Collegiate Baseball Writers' Association Division II All-American Team. The Donald R. Hays Basketball Scholarship is awarded to the member of the men‚Äôs varsity basketball team with the highest grade point average. Enid Jets The Enid Jets were established in 2001, and have had 18 championships, 21 NJCAA All-Americans, and 58 Academic All-Americans.

Skeena was constructed as a destroyer escort and was converted in the 1960s to a helicopter-carrying destroyer. In 1972, the ship was designated a French Language Unit, the second in Canadian service.Hadley et al., p. 319 Discarded in 1994, the ship was broken up in India. Design and description Two St. Laurent-class destroyers in their original configuration The need for the St. Laurent class came about in 1949 when Canada joined NATO and the Cold War was in its infancy. The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) was assigned responsibility for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and controlling sea space in the western North Atlantic. The St Laurent class were built to an operational requirement much like that which produced the British Type 12, and were powered by the same machinery plant. The rounded deck-edge forward was adopted to prevent ice forming.Friedman, p. 161 The vessels were designed to operate in harsh Canadian conditions. They were built to counter nuclear, biological and chemical attack conditions, which led to a design with a rounded hull, a continuous main deck, and the addition of a pre- wetting system to wash away contaminants. The living spaces on the ship were part of a \\"citadel\\" which could be sealed off from contamination for the crew safety. The ships were sometimes referred to as \\"Cadillacs\\" for their relatively luxurious crew compartments; these were also the first Canadian warships to have a bunk for every crew member since previous warship designs had used hammocks.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 9‚Äì11 As built, the ships were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 17 The destroyer escorts displaced standard and at deep load.Conway's says 2000 tons standard displacement, 2600 deep load. The destroyer escorts had a crew of 12 officers and 237 enlisted. Armament The St. Laurent class was fitted with twin /L50 caliber guns in two mounts for engaging both surface and air targets. The ships were also fitted with two single-mounted guns. The class's anti-submarine armament consisted of a pair of triple-barreled Mk. NC 10 Limbo ASW mortars in a stern well. The stern well had a roller top to close it off from following seas. As with the British Type 12 design, the provision for long-range homing torpedoes (in this case BIDDER [Mk 20E] or the US Mark 35 were included. However, they were never fitted. Machinery The vessels of the St. Laurent class had two Babcock & Wilcox water tube boilers installed. The steam produced by these boilers was directed at two geared steam turbines which powered two shafts, providing to drive the ship at a maximum speed of .Blackman, p. 35 The ships had an endurance of at . DDH conversion Following successful trials aboard the frigate and sister ship , plans to convert the St. Laurent class took shape.Soward (1995), pp. 63‚Äì65Blackman, pp. 35, 37 Th development of the beartrap, installed in during her 1962‚Äì63 conversion, finalized the concept. By keeping the aircraft secure, the beartrap eliminated the need for deck handling from landing to the hangar, or from hangar to takeoff. In the conversion to a helicopter-carrying vessel, Skeena was gutted except for machinery and some forward spaces. The hull was strengthened, fueling facilities for the helicopter and activated fin stabilizers installed. The fin stabilizers were to reduce roll in rough weather during helicopter operations.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 12‚Äì13 All seven St Laurents were fitted with helicopter platforms and SQS 504 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS). The single funnel was altered to twin stepped funnels to permit the forward extension of the helicopter hangar. To make room for the helicopter deck, the aft 3-inch mount and one of the Limbos were removed.Chumbley & Gardiner, p. 44 The two 40 mm guns were also removed. Following the conversion, the displacement remained the same at standard load but at full load, it increased to . DELEX program In the late 1970s, under the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program was commissioned to upgrade ten of the St. Laurent-class ships with new electronics, machinery, and hull upgrades and repairs. However, only enough was done to keep the ships in service into the late 1980s. For the St. Laurents, this meant hull and machinery repairs only.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 16 Service history HMCS Skeena commissioning, 1957 Skeena was laid down by Burrard Yarrows at Vancouver on 1 June 1951. The vessel was launched on 19 August 1952 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 30 March 1957, initially carrying the hull number DDE 207, as a destroyer escort.Macpherson & Barrie (2002), p. 250 After commissioning, Skeena was assigned to the Second Canadian Escort Squadron based out of Esquimalt, British Columbia.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 32‚Äì33 The Second Canadian Escort Squadron departed on a training cruise around the Pacific in January 1958, returning on 2 April. On 29 January 1962, Skeena accidentally shelled an American village in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. As one of four ships practicing their gunnery, some of the shrapnel from the ship's guns fell on Clallam Bay, Washington. The commander of the warship, Richard H. Leir, faced a court-martial for the event. He was later convicted. Skeena underwent conversion to a destroyer helicopter escort (DDH) beginning in 1964 by Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec. The vessel exited the yard and was recommissioned as a DDH with the hull number DDH 207 on 14 August 1965. Following re-entry into service, the ship joined the Third Canadian Escort Squadron at Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1972, Skeena was designated a French Language Unit (FLU), replacing Ottawa. A French Language Unit was a Canadian Forces designation where French was to be the primarily spoken language to encourage career opportunities for Canadian Francophones.Hadley et al., pp. 310‚Äì312 During the 1976 Summer Olympics which were held in Montreal, Quebec, the vessel was among those assigned to provide security. Skeena was selected by the Canadian Forces for the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program and completed this refit on 20 November 1981 at Montreal. However, the ship only began sea trials with the modifications on 4 January 1982. In May 1985, Skeena deployed as part of STANAVFORLANT, NATO's standing naval fleet. On 24‚Äì26 May, Skeena and tracked a Soviet task force off the coast of Portugal. During the summer of 1991, the ship participated in the NATO naval exercise Ocean Safari 91. She was paid off from active service in the Canadian Forces on 1 November 1993. Skeena was sold in 1994 and broken up in India in 1996.

The recording is regarded as one of the most important precursors of what later became known as rock and roll.Nick Tosches, Unsung Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll, Secker & Warburg, 1991, Peter J. Silvester, A Left Hand Like God : a history of boogie-woogie piano (1989), .M. Campbell, ed., Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on (Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), p. 99. \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2018, as one of the five new entrants in the \\"Classic of Blues Recording (Song)\\" category. Original recording Johnson was a boogie-woogie pianist in Kansas City, who in the early 1930s had developed a partnership with Turner, who was working at the time as a club bartender. Turner would shout blues rhymes to Johnson's music. In 1938, the pair were invited by music promoter and producer John Hammond to the first From Spirituals to Swing concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City. While in New York, Turner and Johnson had a session with the Vocalion record company, recording the 12-bar blues \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" on December 30, 1938. The song was an up-tempo boogie woogie which had become Johnson's signature tune in the Kansas City clubs. In performance, Turner often included many well-rehearsed blues verses, or improvised lyrics, to extend the performance for an hour or more.Paul Oliver, \\"Blues\\", in The New Grove Gospel, Blues and Jazz, Macmillan, 1980, , p.91Larry Birnbaum, Before Elvis: The Prehistory of Rock 'n' Roll, Rowman & Littlefield, 2013, pp. 111‚Äì112 According to Paul Oliver, the recording \\"features spectacular piano playing by Johnson and a forceful vocal by Turner in the style he made famous - half-shouted and with repetitive phrases building up tension at the close.\\" Larry Birnbaum wrote that: > \\"..\\"Roll 'Em Pete may well be regarded as the first rock'n'roll record. > Although earlier songs contain elements of rock'n'roll, \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" is a > full-fledged rocker in all but instrumentation ... Johnson's bass line is a > simple Chuck Berry-like chug, and his furious right hand embellishments > anticipate Berry's entire guitar style. Some of Turner's verses are the > stuff that rock is made of ... But others are too mature for teenage > listeners. If anything, Turner's brilliant phrasing and Johnson's > breathtaking keyboard technique are too sophisticated for rock'n'roll; the > music has yet to be formularized for mass consumption.\\" After Vocalion became a subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1938, the original recording of \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled Boogie Woogie (Columbia album C44). \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" contained one of the earliest recorded examples of a back beat; the song is also notable for its use of straight rhythm ‚Äì well into the 1950s, most, if not all, similar recordings were played in shuffle rhythm. Turner later recorded many other versions, with various combinations of musicians, over the ensuing years, particularly in the 1950s when he became a star of rock and roll. Later versions The tune was later recorded by many other artists, including: * Albert Ammons * Bill Wyman on his 2004 album Just for a Thrill * Chuck Berry * Count Basie & Joe Williams on their 1956 album Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings * Harry James released a live version in 1966 on his album Live At The Riverboat (Dot DLP 3728 and DLP 25728) * Jimmy Witherspoon * Lionel Hampton * Lou Rawls on his 1963 album Black and Blue * Rob Agerbeek on his 1998 album Three of a Kind * T-Bone Walker * The Blasters ReferencesExternal links * Category:1938 songs Category:1938 singles Category:Blues songs Category:Vocalion Records singles ","title":"Roll 'Em Pete"},{"id":"12782634","text":"Dr Margaret Elsworth MBE (born 5 December 1929, East Grinstead, Sussex) was the founder of the African Scholars' Fund and the African Scholars' Fund UK.

It is centered around the National Political Institutes of Education or \\"NaPolA\\" schools created under the government of Nazi Germany. These military academies were designed as preparatory schools for the future Nazi political and military elite. Plot In 1942, Friedrich Weimer's (Max Riemelt) boxing skills earn him an appointment to a National Political Academy (NaPolA), a high school that serves as an entry to the Nazi elite. His father, a skilled factory worker who despises the Nazis, flatly refuses to allow Friedrich to enroll. Friedrich, who sees the school as his ticket to university and a better life, forges his father's signature on the permission form and leaves during the night. He makes his way to the town of Allenstein, where the school is located, getting a ride from passing cars or trucks when possible and walking the rest of the way. Friedrich's forged papers are overlooked when he arrives. He is taken by fellow student, Christoph Schneider to be kitted out in the school Nazi style uniform. Friedrich is unaware of the true purpose of the school and is greatly impressed in his first day at Allenstein. However, Friedrich's idealistic view of Allenstein is soon tarnished by the harsh, rigid discipline that governs the school. Older students are able to bully younger students almost at will, since there is little interference from school officials, who not only encourage such behavior but actually participate in it themselves. One boy, Siegfried Gladen, endures repeated public humiliation for his tendency to wet the bed as he sleeps. The school teaches the Nazi Party creed to its students, with sections of Hitler's speeches and writings being analyzed in classes. \\"Survival of the fittest\\" is advocated as the natural way of life, and Jews and all other enemies of the state are presented as treacherous and by nature inferior. The boxing trainer who got Friedrich appointed works with him one- on-one, teaching Friedrich to be hard and ruthless in fights, dismissing any kind of compassion for the other boxer as \\"bullshit\\". Back at his room, Friedrich receives a letter from his mother, informing him that his father has been paid a visit by the Gestapo. Friedrich visits Albrecht one evening, finding him in a writing and mail office that the students use. Albrecht confides that his talents lie in writing and the arts, areas his father sees as unfit for men. His mother is more supportive but is ultimately just as uninterested. Albrecht begins writing for the school newspaper, taking advice and criticism from Friedrich. When Friedrich has his first competitive boxing match against another NaPolA school, he gradually overpowers the other boy, knocking him down into a corner. Urged on by the shouts of his trainer and other students and officials, he delivers a brutal knockout punch, winning the match. Friedrich is congratulated by staff and students alike, but Albrecht is far less enthusiastic. One day, the seventh-year boys are taken to the trenches on school grounds, where the sports instructor demonstrates use of live stick grenades. Each of the boys in Friedrich's year make the throw successfully, until one boy, Martin, panics and drops it. The sports instructor screams at him and flees the trench, leaving the boys to their fate. At that moment, Siegfried Gladen pushes through the ranks and dives on the grenade barely a second before it explodes. Gauleiter Heinrich Steiner arrives to make a speech at the funeral, praising Siegfried Gladen as a martyr of the Fatherland and posthumously awarding him the Lifesaving Medallion. Albrecht invites Friedrich to come with him to the Steiner family's home, a vast mansion in the countryside. Heinrich Steiner returns home for his birthday, treated to a special dinner by his wife and a group of friends from the Nazi Party, German Army, and Waffen-SS. He wastes no time criticizing Albrecht for his polite, artistic manner and lack of athletic talent. A boxer himself, Heinrich Steiner is far more interested in Friedrich than in his own son, and delights in Albrecht's inability to even compete with Friedrich when the two are taken downstairs and forced to fight a boxing match. During the winter, a group of military vehicles arrives at the school at night. The entire seventh-year class is called outside, where Gauleiter Heinrich Steiner informs them that a group of Soviet POW's have overpowered their guards, stolen weapons, and escaped from the nearby village. The boys are armed with Karabiner 98k rifles and sent into the woods to search for them. Friedrich and Albrecht, assigned to the same group, end up deep in the frozen woods. Abruptly, a group of figures come out of hiding and try to run back over the crest of a nearby hill, ignoring the boys' shouts to halt. The boys open fire, shooting each of the Russians. Moving closer, they are shocked to find that not only were none of the prisoners armed, but they were all young boys, no older than the German students. A horrified Albrecht vainly tries to bandage the wounds of one prisoner still left alive, but his father arrives with a search party and shoots the Russian. As the boys are taken back to Allenstein, they see the rest of the POW's being rounded up and hear a long, rattling fusillade of gunfire in the woods. In class the next day, Albrecht reads aloud an essay in which he condemns the execution of the Soviet POW's as a criminal act and his own participation in it as \\"evil\\". Outraged, school authorities summon his father, who coldly informs Albrecht that he will write a new essay, starting with an apology for his previous statements. Albrecht instead writes a second essay in which he condemns his father for ordering the POW's executed. Learning that Albrecht is to be expelled from school and drafted into the Waffen-SS to fight on the Eastern Front, Friedrich asks what he will do next. Albrecht answers, \\"I don't know.\\" The next morning, the sports instructor wakes the boys up early and orders them out onto the frozen lake near the school. Two holes have been made in the ice, and each boy must dive in one and swim to the other, using a rope that the first pulls through as a guide. Friedrich makes the swim through the freezing water, but Albrecht dives in and doesn't come out. Friedrich finds him halfway between the holes, having deliberately halted under the ice. Hearing Friedrich's shouts, Albrecht looks up and gives a slight shake of his head. Touching a hand to the underside of the ice, Albrecht lets go of the rope, sinking deep into the freezing water and vanishing from sight. Deeply grieved, Friedrich writes an obituary for his friend and asks the headmaster to publish it in the school newspaper, but the headmaster refuses, stating that \\"Amidst people who have died for Fuehrer, Fatherland, and Nation, there is no place for suicides.\\" The upcoming boxing match against the NaPolA school in Potsdam is a great source of interest for both schools. Friedrich, who has been accused of complicity in Albrecht's death by his indifferent father, is told that his future at Allenstein is very much tied to the outcome of this match. Scouts from prominent German universities are watching, as well as Allenstein's headmaster and Gauleiter Heinrich Stein. Despite managing to overpower his opponent, Friedrich now hesitates to strike a fallen opponent. The other boy gets back up and begins punching Friedrich, who does not retaliate. Friedrich stands impassively until he is knocked out, turning what nearly was a victory for Allenstein into a humiliating defeat. As the camera gradually blurs the scene out of focus, Friedrich, knocked out and lying on the floor, closes his eyes and smiles with relief. Friedrich is expelled the next day. He is not allowed to speak to any of his roommates as he leaves, and is taken to the gates by the sports instructor with the same suitcase and summertime clothes that he arrived in. The instructor shoves Friedrich out the front gates and closes them in his face. A defeated Friedrich looks back at Allenstein briefly, then begins walking, soon disappearing into the falling snow. A closing narration states: > Until 1945 there were in the German Reich around 40 National Political > Educational Institutes with more than 15,000 students. When the war was > finally acknowledged as being lost, they were sent out into the \\"Final > Struggle\\". Blinded by instructed fanaticism and insufficiently armed, they > still offered bitter resistance in many battles. Half of them died. CastProduction Bouzov Castle in the Czech Republic is used as the location for the fictitious school named Allenstein in the film. Gansel's goal was for the film to feel very authentic and was advised by a former student of a Napola. Gansel drew inspiration from his right-wing grandfather who was a teacher in a Napola. Gansel's grandfather explained that it was the feeling of endless opportunities that came along with wearing the teachers military uniform and his own failed dream of becoming an architect that attracted him to the movement. Friedrich ended up being partly based on Gansel's grandfather. Dennis Gansel named Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist as an influence.  Reception  The film gained an approval rating of 68% on Rotten Tomatoes with 26 out of 38 reviews calling it fresh.

In 1945, Archbishop Cushing decided to separate it from Saint Cecilia Parish and designate it as a shrine for the adoration of the Eucharist, entrusting it to the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. In the late 1960s, the Shrine was designated as a center for ministry to students.

Silk Stockings was directed by Rouben Mamoulian, produced by Arthur Freed, and starred Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. The supporting cast includes Janis Paige, Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin, and George Tobias repeating his Broadway role. It was choreographed by Eugene Loring and Hermes Pan. It received Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Film and Best Actress (Charisse) in the Comedy/Musical category. The score was embellished with the new song \\"The Ritz Roll and Rock\\", a parody of then-emerging rock and roll. The number ends with Astaire symbolically smashing his top hat, considered one of his trademarks, signaling his retirement from movie musicals, which he announced following the film's release. Plot summary A brash American film producer, Steve Canfield (Fred Astaire), wants Russian composer Peter Illyich Boroff (Wim Sonneveld) to write music for his next picture, which is being made in Paris. But when the composer expresses his wish to stay in Paris, three comically bumbling operatives, Brankov (Peter Lorre), Bibinski (Jules Munshin) and Ivanov (Joseph Buloff), are sent from Moscow to take Boroff back. Canfield manages to corrupt them with decadent western luxuries (champagne, women, nightclubs, etc.) and talks them into allowing Boroff to stay. He also arranges for his leading lady, Peggy Dayton (Janis Paige), to \\"convince\\" Boroff to cooperate. Fearful of his own precarious position, a commissar at the Ministry in Moscow summons a dedicated and humorless workaholic operative, Nina \\"Ninotchka\\" Yoschenko (Cyd Charisse), to bring all four men back home. Canfield succeeds in romancing her, despite her determination not to fall prey to the decadent attractions of Paris. He even proposes marriage. She and Boroff are horrified when they realize what changes have been made to Boroff's music. They decide to return to Moscow. Canfield does not give up, arranging for the pliable Brankov, Bibinski, and Ivanov to be sent back to Paris, knowing that they will be seduced again by the city's charms. Ninotchka is sent after them, giving Canfield time to convince her to give in to her love for him.

The Wollaston beach promenade has a significant seawall as it is impacted by coastal tides. There are seasonal restaurants that predominately offer battered seafood and become popular on weekends. There is ample parking along the Wollaston Beach promenade. The views from Wollaston beach include Boston, South Boston, Squantum, Houghs Neck, and Nut Island. Boston Harbor Islands are also visible. These islands are; Moon, Long, Georges and Peddocks, Spectacle. The Hull Wind Turbine #1 () is visible beyond Peddocks. The Hull Wind Turbine #2 () is visible beyond Houghs Neck. Based on water quality tests determining levels of enterococcus, currently, the beach is not unacceptable for bathing. This research was conducted in 2019 by the City of Quincy Health Department. Wollaston Beach has two yacht clubs and is adjacent to the commercial Marina Bay. The southern end of the beach attracts fishing activities. The Squantum Yacht Club and Wollaston Yacht Club have piers to their clubhouse starting at the beach. The Squantum Yacht Club was founded in 1898. The yacht clubs host annual sailing tournaments. History In the 1970s, former FBI agent John Connolly reports having convinced the organized crime boss of the Winter Hill Gang, James Bulger (Whitey) to comply to be an FBI informant. The discrete discussion occurring in a secluded parking area at Wollaston Beach. In the decade of 1980s, Quincy Bay was recorded as was one of the most polluted in the United States of America. This was as a result of the archaic sewerage system dumping approximately 138 tons of waste daily into Boston Harbor. Pollution and water quality had then been less of a concern for the City of Boston and there had been little resistance from the City of Quincy. The outfall pipe was commonly known as the 'bubbler'. Wollaston Beach had to be permanently closed for shellfishing and swimming given the toxicology of the water quality. In 1982, it was determined that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had knowingly violated and breached the federal Clean Water Act. The City of Quincy successfully sued the Commonwealth for the breach of daily dumping sewerage into Quincy Bay. In 1990, Wollaston Beach was selected by the Environmental Protection Agency as an Estuary of National Significance given the history. The intent is to monitor sewerage waste, drainage, stormwater waste, and illegal dumping. Attempts to improve water quality, sanitation and hygiene continue though current tests indicate the water quality is acceptable for bathing. Despite the environmental challenges, Wollaston Beach is a populated summer destination for enjoying the considerably large promenade.

This is one of Borges' (who died a few years after writing it) last stories, but it differs little, both thematically and stylistically from the much earlier stories that made him famous. The story's themes include memory, Shakespeare, and writing.  Plot  The protagonist and narrator is Hermann S√∂rgel, a self-described devotee of Shakespeare. After giving a short list of works that he has written on Shakespeare, he tells the story of how he came to be in possession of Shakespeare's Memory: He meets a man named Daniel Thorpe at a Shakespeare conference, and after relating a story about a ring that had a price so high it could never be sold, Thorpe then offers S√∂rgel Shakespeare's memory, and after a short retelling of how he managed to get hold of it, passes it on to him. The memory, Thorpe says, has to be 'discovered': S√∂rgel whistles melodies he has never heard, and slowly starts seeing unknown faces in his dreams. Later, he gains insights into Shakespeare's works and techniques, and considers but decides against writing a biography. Soon after, Shakespeare's memory almost overwhelms his own: one day he becomes confused as he does not recognise engines and cars. Finally he decides to give away the memory by telephone: he phones random numbers (sparing women and children from the memory), and at last gives the memory to a man on the other end of the phone.

It includes songs with music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Craig Carnelia. This was Ephron's first stage play. Plot Writers Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy reunite in hell and reflect on their decades-long antagonistic relationship. Dating back to their first meeting at a conference at Sarah Lawrence College in 1948, it came to a head in 1980 when McCarthy, in a television interview with Dick Cavett, asserted, \\"every word she writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'\\". Hellman subsequently sued McCarthy for slander. As the play progresses, the two women recall, among other things, Hellman's 1952 testimony before the House Un- American Activities Committee; McCarthy's childhood abuse by an uncle; and their romantic involvements: McCarthy with Philip Rahv and Hellman with Dashiell Hammett. Throughout it all, McCarthy accuses Hellman of repeatedly presenting fiction as fact, while Hellman insists McCarthy always portrays fact as fiction. Productions Directed by Jack O'Brien, choreographed by Jerry Mitchell, and starring Cherry Jones as McCarthy, Swoosie Kurtz as Hellman, and Harry Groener as all the men in their lives, the play had its world premiere at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, where it ran from September 21 through November 3, 2002. The production transferred to Broadway, opening at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on December 12, 2002. It closed on February 16, 2003 after 76 performances and 20 previews. Critical reception In his CurtainUp review of the San Diego production, Gordon Osmond called it \\"an uncomfortable cross between vaudeville and conventional musical comedy.\\" He observed, \\"From its outset Act II shows that the production has been hijacked by Mr. Hamlisch and select members of his troupe of gypsies. The plays breaks out into a rash of stand-alone and largely incongruous musical numbers, which seem concocted for the sole purpose of filling up a record album designed perhaps to defray the production's undoubtedly daunting costs . . . [W]e have a desiccated trial scene which didn't happen in life and shouldn't, in its present form, have happened on stage. The finale consists of an off-stage cat fight between the stuffed doll alter egos of Hellman and McCarthy. Having two women of wit, wisdom and letters slug it out physically, albeit offstage, is not just imaginary, it's artistically misguided, pandering to that segment of the audience which doesn't for a moment understand the substance and potential of the play.\\" He concluded, \\"Imaginary Friends has the feel of a work by a new playwright who was recently quoted as saying that she 'got a taste of the freedom that theater offered . . .' What the playwright failed to recognize is that the theatre has its own rules; e.g., thematic and stylistic consistency.\\" Osmond, Gordon. \\"CurtainUp California Review\\" curtainup.com, 2002 In his review of the Broadway production, Ben Brantley of The New York Times said it \\"isn't a show that leaves you gasping at its daring or chuckling over its cleverness. In chronicling a feud between two politically engaged, exceptionally feisty women within a literary world of men, Ms. Ephron makes her points dutifully, clearly and repetitively . . . In trying to appeal to both those who are and those who are not familiar with the play's high-brow heroines, the show winds up sacrificing its dramatic energy to Cliff Notes-like expositions disguised in masquerade costumes . . . Mr. Hamlisch's songs, with lyrics by Craig Carnelia, are tuneful, jinglelike numbers that add little in period flavor or character definition. And some of them simply slow things down to no purpose.\\" New York Times Reviewing for Talkin' Broadway, Matthew Murray noted Nora Ephron \\"has a thrillingly theatrical concept that she simply hasn't taken to its furthest extremes. This being her first play, that is perhaps understandable, and Imaginary Friends is never incompetent or boring. It does manage to be exciting occasionally, but less often than it should be . . . What Ephron gets right is her depiction of Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy as avatars for the diametrically opposed (maybe) deities of 'fiction' and 'fact.' . . . When Imaginary Friends tackles that aspect of the story, presenting its scenes with the flair and creativity only theatre can allow, the play is at its best . . . These moments . . . are theatrically astute and emotionally honest . . . Scenes that give us greater insight into the characters are always the most successful and entertaining.\\" He called the songs \\"the most puzzling component\\" of the play, commenting, \\"While the songs don't slow down or detract from the action, they do not particularly enhance it.\\" He concluded, \\"What is missing, and would probably have made the show more effective, is the literary music created by McCarthy and Hellman. For the most part, their writings - as lyrical and incisive as one is apt to find - are missing from the play, and the contributions of Hamlisch and Carnelia are a poor substitute. Late in the show, when we're reminded of the real legacy these women leave behind in the impressive volume of material each produced, it becomes all too obvious that Imaginary Friends is weaker for its absence. Given what is present, Nora Ephron could have quite a theatre career ahead of her . . . However, she would be expected to correct her lapses in judgment here in the future; if the addition of the songs was her idea, she should think twice next time and let her characters sing all on their own.\\" \\"Theatre Review.

Separate committees within the club oversee the Minis and Juniors and main club. Early history Although there is mention of rugby being played in Abergavenny as far back 1867, the Abergavenny club was formed in 1875 through Faithful's Army and Navy Training College.

The club backs onto the two rugby pitches at Bailey Park. The clubhouse was extended in 2004/05 to include new changing rooms, showers and physio room through a grant from the Sports Council of Wales in association with the Welsh Rugby Union. The club houses a ground floor lounge and a first floor function room, committee room and kitchen facility. The rugby club grandstand in Bailey Park was built in 1999 and at that time had seating in from the old Cardiff Arms Park. It was officially opened by Sir Tasker Watkins President of the WRU. Over the years the stand has suffered much vandalism all the seating and later the Welsh slate roof has had to be removed for safety reasons due to vandalism. The roof has been replaced with steel sheeting. The project will take time and money is needed for new seating for supporters and also the stand needs vandal proof shutters to prevent its use to only rugby supporters.Abergavenny RFC website During the 2010/2011 season new floodlights were erected following funding from the Millennium Stadium Charitable Trust, Monmouthshire County Council and a large donation from the Mini and Junior sections of the club raised through their successful annual Rugby Festival 'The Tournament' that takes place at Usk Showground each year. The lights cost in the region of ¬£50K. The Tournament is held each year on the May Day Bank holiday at the Usk showground. The 2010 festival of rugby is the largest in Wales and surpassed last years numbers with nearly 4300 players and over 170 teams represented by 56 clubs competing in all age groups from Under 7 to Under 16. For the third season we will also had a U15 Girls and a U18 Ladies tournament held on the Sunday during the Mini Day and a senior ladies 7-a-side on the Saturday. Over 20 pitches are used at times with matches from 10.30am until the closing award ceremony in the late afternoon / early evening. The Tournament is played under the WRU Pathway rules for the various age groups. It is not a charitable event and the cost of the weekend falls on the Junior and Mini Sections of the club. Welsh international rugby players attend each year with Ian Gough and Ryan Jones attending the most. James Hook, Luke Charteris, Rhys Thomas and Hal Luscombe have appeared in previous years. As of 2010 the tournament is in 8th season having grown from three teams in Bailey Park, Abergavenny in 2001. The event then moved to Raglan Sports Fields in 2002 until 2007 when it outgrew that site. It has been resident at the Usk Showgrounds until present. For over 20 years at Easter the Mini section has forged a special bond with ROC Cholet, France. Alternative years the players from Cholet and Abergavenny are hosted as each visits the other and trips are arranged to show the players and families local sights and customs culminating in matches on the Sunday.

Rockers director Theodoros Bafaloukos had seen Kiddus recording \\"Graduation In Zion\\" in 1976, two years before the film was made, and decided to film Kiddus recording the track as part of the movie. Kiddus had by then released a few singles on his own Shepherd label, including \\"Security In The Streets\\" which was recorded with Lee Perry at his Black Ark studio.Greene, Jo- Ann \\"[ Inna De Yard Review]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-04-07 Dowding was a prominent member of the Peace Movement, and \\"Security in the Streets\\" was one of the first of several songs recorded in appreciation of the Peace Treaty of 1978 between rival political gang-leaders Claudie Massop and Bucky Marshall. After releasing a handful of further singles, and recording an album that was not released due to the master tapes getting lost, little was heard of Kiddus I until French label Makasound issued Inna De Yard in 2005, one of a series of albums recorded acoustically by vintage reggae artists in Jamaica. Japanese label Dub Store Records then reissued some of the 1970s singles, followed by the anthology Graduation In Zion: 1978-1980 in 2007. In June 2009, Kiddus I released Green Fa Life (Naya Records), remarkably his first full length electric instrumentation album of his 30+ year career. Green Fa Life sees Kiddus I team up with roots reggae legends Earl \\"Chinna\\" Smith and Leroy 'Horsemouth' Wallace, although that is naming just a few of the very respected heavy weight artists who also play on the album.

associated with dystrophin, the protein associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy. The name comes from the Greek word syntrophos, meaning \\"companion.\\" The five syntrophins are encoded by separate genes and are termed Œ±, Œ≤1, Œ≤2, Œ≥1, and Œ≥2. Syntrophin was first identified as a dystrophin-associated protein present in the Torpedo electric organ (originally called \\"58K protein\\"). Subsequently, Œ±-syntrophin was shown to be the predominant isoform in skeletal muscle where it is localized on the sarcolemma and enriched at the neuromuscular junction. The Œ≤-syntrophins and Œ≥2-syntrophin are also present in skeletal muscle but also are in most other tissues. The expression of Œ≥1-syntrophin is mostly confined to brain. The syntrophins are adaptor proteins that use their multiple protein interaction domains (two pleckstrin homology domains and a PDZ domain) to localize a variety of signaling proteins (kinases, ion channels, water channels, nitric oxide synthase) to specific intracellular locations. Œ±-Syntrophin binds to nNOS in the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex in skeletal muscle cells. There it produces NO upon muscle contraction leading to dilation of the arteries in the local area.http://jcs.biologists.org/content/117/13/2627.full.pdf ReferencesExternal links * Category:Protein families ","title":"Syntrophin"},{"id":"12783136","text":"O'Gorman is a surname.

The name of the partisan force, coined by the Holocaust historians, is borrowed from the Parczew forest located a short distance away from Lublin, halfway to the town of Sobib√≥r, the location of the Sobib√≥r extermination camp during the Holocaust in occupied Poland. The Jews who managed to escape from the camp hid in there along with the considerable number of Jewish families of the Lublin Ghetto. The area including Parczew and W≈Çodawa counties near Lublin in the General Government became one of the primary battlefields of the Jewish partisan movement. An area of forests and lakes with few passable roads, the Parczew forests were an ideal location for partisan activity. Notable partisan leaders included Ephraim (Frank) Bleichman, Harold Werner, and Shmuel (Mieczys≈Çaw) Gruber. Werner and Gruber were second-in-command to Yechiel Grynszpan, who led Jewish forces in the Parczew forest, and Bleichman was one of Grynszpan's two platoon commanders. The same forest constituted the main base of the non-Jewish Polish partisan movement as well. Such high concentration of resistance including Gwardia Ludowa (GL), Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie (BCh), and Armia Krajowa (AK) was possible only due to strong material support from the surrounding counties. History The group fought along with the People's Guard () in a number of intense engagements against German forces, making use of machine guns, explosives for mining railways and other supplies air-dropped by Soviet forces, with food stuffs requisitioned from local farmers. They participated in the takeover of the city of Parczew on April 16, 1944. The Holocaust Encyclopedia claims that the Polish Home Army (AK) usually refused to accept Jews. This information however, is challenged on statistical grounds by the Jewish veteran of the Polish Home Army First Armoured Division, Willie Glaser who wrote, that Jewish resistance fighters were members of the Armia Krajowa in considerable numbers as well. Also, Gwardia Ludowa (GL) partisans, created by the communist PPR in January 1942 (with whom Parczew partisans aligned themselves) were engaged in terror aimed at local domination. On one occasion, the unit of Gwardia Ludowa commanded by Grzegorz Korczy≈Ñski from Kra≈õnik County near Lublin, committed mass atrocities in the village of Ludmi≈Ç√≥wka on 6 December 1942 killing dozens of Jews in retaliation for the PPR action in Grab√≥wka against their own men. The murders were hushed up in Stalinist Poland by the Ministry of Public Security engaged in brutal persecution of the AK soldiers. After Operation Barbarossa, the German military and Orpo aided by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police battalions, began mass deportations of Polish inhabitants of Zamojszczyzna south of Che≈Çm in preparation for the Generalplan Ost resettlement ordered by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. produced by Telewizja Polska S.A., Lublin, Dzia≈Ç Form Dokumentalnych, for Program 2, TVP S.A., 1999 (42 min. in colour and black-and-white).

According to Jewish sources, the Jewish partisans themselves used to execute Ukrainian villagers \\"who had gone to the woods to round up the Jews who had escaped\\" from the ghettos.

Sixty-six people were on the ship at the time; there were no reported injuries related to the incident. Coast Guard officials said the cruise ship's captain acted properly by running the ship aground to prevent it from sinking in deeper water. At least one survivor said she never felt in danger. Cruise West repositioned Spirit of Nantucket to their Pacific operations in early 2008. The vessel was renamed Spirit of Glacier Bay (2), reviving the name once held by the first overnight vessel in the fleet. On 7 July 2008, Spirit of Glacier Bay (2) ran aground again, this time in her namesake park at the head of Tarr Inlet. No casualties or injuries were reported and passengers were given options to be re-accommodated on other Cruise West cruises, receive sizable refunds of their cruise fare, and/or given gift certificates towards a future cruise. After her grounding, Spirit of Glacier Bay went back to Seattle, where she laid up at Jacobsens Terminal in the Ballard neighborhood. She was used from 2008-2010 as floating accommodation, training, meeting, and storage space for Cruise West. In 2010 Cruise West announced plans to rename the vessel either Spirit of America or Spirit of Adventure, give her the extensive shipyard work necessary to make her structurally sound and operational again, and to run the vessel on a series of itineraries in eastern North America similar to her original routes, including the Mississippi, the New England coast, and the Great Lakes / St. Lawrence River. Cruise West ceased operations on 18 September 2010, before beginning the work necessary to return the vessel to service. In 2015, the vessel was purchased by Alaska Dream Cruises. After extensive modification, she was placed back into service in Southeast Alaska as the Chichagof Dream.https://www.adventuresmithexplorations.com/cruises/ships/chichagof- dream/ See also *List of cruise ships ReferencesExternal links *Cruise West Category:Maritime incidents in the United States Category:Cruise ships of the United States Category:1984 ships ","title":"Spirit of Glacier Bay"},{"id":"12783186","text":"Jung Borochovistim, also known as Jungbor, was a Jewish youth movement named after the Leftist Marxist Zionist ideologue, Ber Borochov.

He was Professor of Economics Emeritus at Columbia University. Biography Born in Seattle, Washington, Cagan and his family moved to Southern California shortly thereafter. Cagan joined the U.S. Navy at age 17 and fought in World War II. After the war, Cagan decided to go to college, and earned his B.A. from UCLA in 1948. Cagan received his M.A. in 1951, and his Ph.D. in Economics in 1954 from the University of Chicago. After graduate school, Cagan joined the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in New York City where he worked for two years. Then Cagan re-entered academia, teaching at the University of Chicago for three years, and at Brown University for seven years. In 1966 Cagan was hired by Columbia University, where he taught economics for nearly thirty years ‚Äî save for fifteen months spent in Washington, D.C., when he was on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA). During his time at Columbia, Cagan was also associated with the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) in Washington, D.C., writing on public policy issues. Cagan lived in Palo Alto, California during his last years. Contributions to economic science Cagan's work focused on monetary policy and the control of inflation. Cagan has published over 100 books, journal articles, reviews, reports, and pamphlets on these and other topics in macroeconomics. He is perhaps best known for Determinants and Effects of Changes in the Stock of Money, 1875‚Äì1960, a work that sought to identify the \\"causal relationships between changes in money, prices and output.\\" The book, part of the NBER series that contained Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz's Monetary History of the United States, 1867‚Äì1960, was praised for its \\"careful empirical work\\" and called \\"the most complete study in the area.\\" Cagan's most important contribution to economics, however, is the article included in Milton Friedman's edited volume Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money (1956), entitled \\"The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation,\\" a work that became an \\"instant classic\\" in the field. The article, which contained \\"extensive manipulation of differential equations and an ingenious use of exponentially weighted averages\\", analyzed seven hyperinflations and found that \\"the parameters of money demand functions estimated during hyperinflation generally satisfy the condition of dynamic stability that precludes the inflation from being self-generating, or displaying period-to-period oscillations.\\" After its publication, Cagan's article generated a significant body of work, as a number of leading macroeconomists either reexamined or extended Cagan's model, most notably \\"Barro (1970), Sargent and Wallace (1973), Frenkel (1975, 1976a, 1976b, 1977, 1979), Sargent (1977), Abel et al. (1979), Salemi (1979), and Salemi and Sargent (1979).\\" In addition, monetary economists today often refer to a \\"Cagan demand function\\" when modeling the real value of money. Because of the impact that this groundbreaking work had upon the economics profession, Cagan was elected Fellow of the Econometric Society (the most prestigious society in the field), and was mentioned as a possible candidate for the Nobel Prize in Economics. However, following his death in 2012, he is no longer eligible for a Nobel Prize.

This means the word that spells something will have a toll-free prefix and a top level domain extension after it. A teledotcom can be accessible by either phone or internet address. Most owners of a toll-free number that spells something (see Phoneword), will also try to register the matching domain name and therefore create a teledotcom; a valuable asset should they wish to sell it. It is significantly more difficult for an owner of a valuable domain names, because the matching toll-free numbers are much rarer. As a consequence of the difficulties in obtaining the domain name and the matching toll-free telephone number, the number of teledotcoms is quite low. Marketing An example teledotcom is 1-800-Flowers.com. Customers can either visit the website or telephone 1-800-FLOWERS (1-800-356-9377). Others examples are 1-800-Mattress.com and 1-800 Contacts.com. To extend their marketing reach, these companies will also advertise on television across the United States. Buyer Jim McCann stated that 1-800-flowers purchased the toll free number from a flower company that was seven million dollars in debt. The toll-free numbers are considered so valuable to the company that the company now owns the same number under the 888, and 877 prefix. When the 866 toll free prefix was launched, competition for the flowers number was stiff, with 1-800-flowers eventually losing to a rival company. Unlike domain names where one person can own eLoans, and another can own eLoan and all can be allowed to use the names as they are considered fair use, toll-free numbers that are first to market and part of a brand, are usually protected. For example, when a New York-based business tried to set up 1-718-Mattress, it was forced to relinquish the use of the number as it confused people by too closely copying the brand of 1-800-Mattress. Using a toll-free number as a brand All companies do not use their web domain names as their brand. Not every company would name themselves after the domain they acquire as they often take a similar but not exact name. However, when a domain name or telephone number spell a valued term, the company will not only use the Toll free, Domain or combination Teledotcom as a brand, they will sometimes even change a long-standing company name to match it. This has happened with lenders for instance, Refinance.com now has that as their name when previously they were another company prior to acquiring the valuable domain name worth seven figures. Using a toll free or teledotcom as a brand is common when they spell a frequently used or understood term. When a company acquires a similar area code to a predecessor such as 1866flowers, it should not name itself as a company, 1866flowers.com etc. It can however fully utilize and publish the number and its spelling for easy remembering for its customers as long as it makes clear that it is part of separate company. The 1-800-Flowers company cannot prohibit the 1866Flowers phone number from use or marketing of the easily remembered phone number when used in conjunction with a distinguishable brand name. The mistake made by 1-718-Mattress is they did not distinguish themselves as a company with another name. Had they been Neighborhood Mattress Inc., with 718-Mattress published alongside, then 1-800 Mattress could not have had a claim that 1-718 was using a confusingly similar name. The use of a phone number and its spelling is a right for any holder of a toll free or other prefix. Telephone numbers are part of a public trust and must be fairly available to anyone on an equal basis. Responsible Organizations (RespOrgs) must honor the rules that distribute phone numbers fairly according to law. Consumer Use of Teledotcoms Consumers enjoy the easy access to services and goods that can be found by simply typing in the word on the keyboard such as flowers, or by simply dialing it. 1-800-Mattress is one such example. Consumers can order mattresses by calling or visiting on the web. Even with the 1-800-Mattress.com being a large purchase for the company, the convenience of telephone ordering from a toll free number that also spells the domain generally will increase business.

History=Before WWI (1905-1914) HeHalutz was founded by Eliezer Joffe in America in 1905, and about the same time in Russia. First World War (1914-1918) During World War I, HeHalutz branches opened across Europe (including Russia), America and Canada. Leaders of the organization included Yitzhak Ben-Zvi (later the second president of the State of Israel), and David Ben-Gurion (later the first Prime Minister of Israel) in America, and Joseph Trumpeldor in Russia. Ben-Gurion was living in Jerusalem at the start of the First World War, where he and Ben Zvi recruited forty Jews into a Jewish militia to assist the Ottoman army. Despite this, he was deported to Egypt in March 1915. From there he made his way to the United States, where he remained for three years.

Comandra blister rust can cause tree losses of up to 7% in some regions where it is common. When C. umbellata is infected by the rust aeciospores from the pine host, yellow, blister-like spots bearing urediniospores appear on the leaves of the plant within 20 days. In the following weeks, teliospores develop on brown, hairlike telia that germinate to produce basidiospores, the fungal life stage capable of infecting pines.

The development was started by Countryside Residential PLC in 1978, using a holistic approach to create a self-contained community on previously greenfield land, of the manors of Springfield Barnes and Cuton Hall. It comprises a variety of modern suburban dwellings, the Chelmer Village Retail Park and Dukes Park Industrial Estate. Together with \\"Beaulieu Park\\" and parts of old Springfield the development forms the \\"Chelmer Village & Beaulieu Park\\" ward of the Springfield Parish and Chelmsford City Council.  History  Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements have been found in and around Chelmer Village. Early Saxon pottery has been found by Cuton Way, Chelmer Village Way. There is evidence of an early structure at Springfield Lyon's that dates back to 3,000 BC, with a field monument called a Causewayed Enclosure. Where later, a Bronze Age settlement within the circular ditch was created. The Springfield Lyon's site was later used by the Romans, and by the Anglo-Saxons as a cemetery. A monument depicting a Palaeolithic Flint axe named the Arrow Head Monument has been erected in Chancellor Park to celebrate the early history. The estate was built upon the farmland of the historic Springfield Barnes manor and opened in 1978, and included the former Barnes Farm, Prentices Farm, Horns Farm and Willshers. The River Chelmer flows along the southern and eastern edges of the suburb, the river also forms part of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation, while the development is bordered in the west and north by the A138. A number of historic features remain nearby the river. These include Barnes Mill Lock, Barnes Mill (now a privately owned home) and the Barnes Farm milking parlour, now a bar and restaurant (the Miller and Carter). Barnes Farm infant and junior schools also derive their names from the farmland they were built on.

Early history  View in the 1920s showing the front exterior of the synagogue that was at the corner of 9th Street and 12th Avenue in South MinneapolisAdath Jeshurun was founded in 1884 by two small groups of Romanian and Russian Jews. Although the congregation, originally known as A‚ÄôTas Yeshurun, began by closely following orthodox Jewish customs, it soon became the first Conservative congregation west of the Mississippi River. In its early years, the synagogue faced three major disasters: In 1888, while in rented premises, a fire destroyed all of its property, and in 1902 a windstorm completely destroyed the congregation's synagogue on Second Street South. The congregation subsequently purchased a church on Seventh Street South in 1903, but it too was destroyed in a windstorm in 1904. In 1912 Adath Jeshurun hired C. David Matt, its first American trained rabbi, and the first to give sermons in English. In 1913 Adath Jeshurun was one of the founding members of the United Synagogue of America, and in 1918 its sisterhood helped found the Women's League for Conservative Judaism.  Recent events  Adath Jeshurun is \\"the oldest affiliate of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism west of Chicago.\\" It describes itself as \\"a progressive, egalitarian, and sacred community dedicated to Torah (learning and tradition), Avodah (prayer and spirituality), and Gemilut Hasadim (acts of loving kindness)\\"\\"Welcome to Adath Jeshurun\\" and it has relocated several times to newer neighborhoods.

A key military base of the Irish Defence Forces, it is the headquarters of 2 Brigade, and houses the Military Archives of the Department of Defence. History The barracks was originally constructed between 1810 and 1815, and named Portobello Barracks for the area in which it was sited. (When Sir Francis Drake looted the city of Portobelo, Panama, died and was buried at sea in its harbour, many places in England and Ireland were commemoratively named Portobello ‚Äì including part of Rathmines in 1696. The nearby canal bridge and the area became known as Portobello and thereafter, the barracks.) In 1817 William Windham Saddler, son of balloonist James Saddler, set off in a hot air balloon from the grounds of the barracks landing in Holyhead in North Wales. Originally designed as a cavalry barracks, it saw some development along these lines, with additional land being purchased, and the addition of a church (1842) and canteen block (1868). During the 1916 Easter Rising, and the Irish War of Independence, British Troops from the barracks were involved in actions throughout Dublin. During this time, three journalists, including the pacifist Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, were murdered outside the barrack guardroom. The Royal Irish Rifles company commander Captain Bowen-Colthurst, who ordered the shootings, was controversially adjudged \\"insane\\" at the subsequent inquiry and court-martial. On 17 May 1922 Irish troops took possession of the Barracks, and it became the National Army's Headquarters under General Michael Collins. In 1952 it was renamed for Cathal Brugha, who was a leader during the 1916 rising, Minister for Defence in the First D√°il, and who lived locally for a time. Cathal Brugha an IRA man was shot by the National Army on O'Connell street during the Battle of Dublin. Current use Since the end of the Irish War of Independence, the barracks has housed units of the Irish Defence Forces, and has more recently been developed as a result of the force's reorganisation. It became the Eastern Command HQ (again) in 1994. Following the 2012 reorganisation of the army, the barracks became headquarters of the reorganised 2 Brigade.

World War II and after He enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces at age 17. By the time he was awarded his wings in 1944, there was no need for more pilots. He left the service in 1947 as a second lieutenant. He graduated from Hampton University in Virginia. The civil-rights era Bohler's persistence would be challenged again after he and his family moved to Tampa, Florida in 1950.TBO.com Obituaries This time, he was told that he could not own his own business. His persistence again paid off as he became Tampa's first African-American licensed electrician and built a successful business, rising to become one of Tampa's first African-American millionaires. In 1960, Bohler, his wife and their three children went to the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa. The family was denied entry to the zoo because of their race. Bohler sued the city for discrimination. During the two years it took to hear the case, Bohler was routinely harassed by city police who would pull his car over and demand to check his driver's license. On the day he was ordered to appear in federal court, he was pulled over five times. Bohler ultimately prevailed, with the result being a 1962 federal order requiring Tampa to integrate its public recreation facilities. Later life Throughout his life, Bohler never forgot his heritage. He and other former Tuskegee Airmen would often speak to school groups. He would attend yearly reunions of the Airmen, flying his own Piper Archer airplane to the events. He was forced to stop flying at the age of 80 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor. Some time later, he fell in his garage and hit his head, which apparently caused bleeding on the brain that was undetected at the time. He was later admitted to a local hospital and spent the next two years in various care facilities. Henry Bohler died on August 10, 2007, in Tampa, Florida, from complications from his injuries, including brain injuries resulting from a fall two years earlier. He was survived by his wife Clifford Bohler, three children Henry Jr., Pamela, and George, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

Initially SA-Sturm III (Dresden) under SA-Sturmf√ºhrer Ernst Jirka guarded the camp, but in May this responsibility fell to SA-Standarte 102 (Zittau) under SA-Standartenf√ºhrer Paul Unterstab. Altogether there were about 150 guards. The camp's commandant was SA-Sturmbannf√ºhrer M√ºller and the adjutant was SA- Sturmbannf√ºhrer Mittag. On April 12, 1933, the camp held 259 prisoners, but that number subsequently increased to almost four hundred. In total, approximately one thousand prisoners passed through the camp. An itemization for Hainewalde revealed that protective custody cost the Saxon government over 130,000 Marks. When the camp was dissolved on August 10, 1933, the remaining prisoners were transferred to larger early concentration camps at Hohnstein Castle and Sachsenburg. Hainewalde's prisoners consisted mainly of leftists and Jews. About 150 were crammed into one barrack, where the prisoners slept on multi-tiered bunks with straw mattresses. The prisoners were required to attend Protestant religious services, as well as nightly Nazi indoctrination. For the latter purpose, younger and older prisoners were housed separately, on the theory that the young prisoners would be more susceptible to Nazification if isolated from their elders. The SA forced the prisoners to perform penal exercises, conducted torture under the pretext of interrogation, and directed all but the most serious cases of injury or illness to a cellar for warehousing without medical treatment. The SA used an administrative office and a special bunker for interrogations. Prisoners were also compelled to work in woodcutting and latrine details. Jews and intellectuals were singled out for humiliation and brutal treatment. The outlawed German Social Democratic Party continued to assist Hainewalde's prisoners. For example, the Prague-based, socialist newspaper Arbeiter- Illustrierte-Zeitung reproduced the photograph of a Hainewalde detainee. A sympathetic SA guard had smuggled the image out of camp, which revealed a prisoner in terrible condition. Zittau's underground Communist organization also smuggled propaganda into the camp that let the prisoners know their suffering had not been forgotten: \\"We know that you have remained loyal to the cause of the working classes with unfaltering courage, in spite of all the terror and despite the harassment to which you have been exposed. ...We know very well-and also the working classes know-what you have suffered. If we send you this greeting despite all difficulties of illegality inside the concentration camp, take it as an avowal of our undivided solidarity with you.\\" The camp administration imposed strict conditions for release from custody. On pain of arrest, released prisoners signed a declaration swearing not to discuss conditions in Hainewalde. According to another declaration, dated August 5, 1933, the released detainee promised not to associate again with \\"Marxist parties.\\" The well-known screenwriter, playwright, and novelist, Axel Eggebrecht, recalled a rumor that the prisoners would be released on May Day, but it turned out not to have any foundation. Eggebrecht was held at Hainewalde from April to May 1933. A resident of Berlin, he was visiting his father in Leipzig at the time of his arrest, March 5, 1933, which coincided with Germany's election day. After a month in jail, he was delivered to Hainewalde. As the prisoners entered the gate, a teacher among them joked that the castle once held the \\"favorites\\" of the Saxon king, August the Strong. A guard then put them through a mindless initiation rite. With the command, \\"Right leg, high!\\" Eggebrecht raised his leg like a \\"stork.\\" When the SA next issued the impossible order to raise the left leg as well, he refused to do so, in the gruff language of the barracks. In the exchange that followed, the guard ascertained that Eggebrecht was a World War veteran. Eggebrecht soon realized, however, that his military service meant little to the guards. Stereotyped as an intellectual, he was ordered to work in a humiliating labor command. \\"Aha-the scriptwriter from Berlin!\\" Sturmf√ºhrer Jirka exclaimed, \\"I have something extra fine for you-the shit detail!\\" Eggebrecht's bunkmate, a Jewish prisoner named Benno Berg, experienced a rare moment of humor after a reeducation session. A Nazi Kreisleiter lectured the detainees on the Jewish threat, quoting the stock phrase, \\"the Jews are our misfortune.\\" After the speech, he inspected the prisoners and stopped in front of Berg. In response to the Kreisleiter's questions, Berg gave his name and birthplace: \\"Berg, from Reichenberg, Bohemia.\\" Not realizing that the prisoner was Jewish, the Nazi announced: \\"A Sudeten national comrade! Bravo! All of you will come to us again!\\" Eggebrecht added: \\"The big shot's fat hand struck the 'non-Aryan' appreciatively on the shoulder. 'For myself, you are the model of the true SA man! Heil Hitler!' Hand raised, he strutted away.\\" Eggebrecht was interrogated, but not tortured. In this regard his experience contrasted with other Hainewalde prisoners. Eggebrecht recalled the interrogator's interest in how he had gotten mixed up with the Communists, after growing up in a \\"good home.\\" His release came through his father's intercession with an influential Saxon official, Professor Apel. Eggebrecht's father wrote him about Apel's interest in his case. Sometime later, his father visited him at the camp. Exclaiming that the conditions were \\"unworthy\\" of his son, the father added that he should be patient, because \\"it won't last much longer!\\" Several days later, Eggebrecht was released after signing a promise not to circulate \\"atrocity stories.\\" In 1948, the Bautzen state court sentenced 39 guards to penitentiary terms for their role in the maltreatment of Hainewalde prisoners. The trial was conducted under the auspices of the Soviet occupation, but further details are not known. No additional information has emerged so far about Hainewalde, for which further research is needed.

The Act reformed the law on divorce, moving litigation from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to the civil courts, establishing a model of marriage based on contract rather than sacrament and widening the availability of divorce beyond those who could afford to bring proceedings for annulment or to promote a private Bill. It was one of the Matrimonial Causes Acts 1857 to 1878.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and Schedule 2 Background Before the Act, divorce was governed by the ecclesiastical Court of Arches and the canon law of the Church of England. As such, it was not administered by the barristers who practised in the common law courts but by the \\"advocates\\" and \\"proctors\\" who practised civil law from Doctors' Commons, adding to the obscurity of the proceedings.Squibb (1977) pp 104‚Äì105 Divorce allowing remarriage was de facto restricted to the very wealthy, as it demanded either a complex annulment process or a private bill, either at great cost. The latter entailed sometimes lengthy debates about a couple's intimate marital relationship in public in the House of Commons.Getzler (2004) A bill to create a civil court to regulate divorce and to allow it to proceed by ordinary civil litigation had been proposed by Lord Aberdeen's coalition but had made no progress. The procedure had largely been designed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Campbell. When Lord Palmerston came to power in 1855, the bill was relaunched. The bill was introduced in the House of Lords and supported by Archbishop of Canterbury John Bird Sumner and the usually conservative Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter. The bill proved controversial, raising particular opposition from future Liberal Party leader William Ewart Gladstone, who saw it as an usurpation of the authority of the Church, and from Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce. Palmerston eventually steered the bill through Parliament, despite Gladstone's attempted filibuster. The Act The Act abolished Ecclesiastical jurisdiction regarding matrimonial matters, and for the first time secular divorces possible (by court order). The Act created a new Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes and gave it jurisdiction to hear and decide civil actions for divorce. Further, it gave rights of audience both to common law barristers and civil law advocates, removing the advocates' previous monopoly in divorce proceedings. The Act allowed legal separation by either husband or wife on grounds of adultery, cruelty, or desertion.Nelson, p. 112 However, were the petitioner an accessory to or condoned the adultery, a divorce could not be obtained. Section 57 of the Act also enabled the parties to remarry after divorce as though the marriage had been dissolved by the death of one of the spouses. It also altered the handling of adultery in English law: it abolished the crime of criminal conversation, but maintained the principle that 'since a wife's adultery caused injury to the husband, it entitled him to claim compensation from the adulterer', implying that the wife was the property of the husband ‚Äì not least because wives could not claim compensation from adulterous husbands. Compensation was no longer, however, paid to the cuckold, but to the court, and damages were not to be punitive or exemplary but purely to compensate a husband's loss of loss of consortium (marital services) of his wife and damages to his reputation, honour, and family life.Marita Carnelley, 'Laws on Adultery: Comparing the Historical Development of South African Common-law Principles with those in English Law', Fundamina (Pretoria), 19.2 (February 2013), 185-211 (pp. 208-9).Jeremy D. Weinstein, 'Adultery, Law, and the State: A History', Hastings Law Journal, 38.1 (1986), 195-238 (p. 167). The Act did not treat women's and men's grounds for divorce equally (largely on the grounds that women's adultery was more serious because it introduced doubt as to the paternity of possible heirs). Thus a husband could petition for divorce on the sole grounds that his wife had committed adultery, whereas a wife could only hope for a divorce based on adultery combined with other offences such as incest, cruelty, bigamy, desertion, etc. (or based on cruelty alone).Nelson, p. 114 The Act also required that a suit by a husband for adultery name the adulterer as a co- respondent, whereas this was not required in a suit by a wife. Implementation and impact The Act came into force on 1 January 1858.  In England and Wales  Such a court would require sensitive but firm supervision and Palmerston appointed Sir Cresswell Cresswell as its first judge-in-ordinary with bipartisan support. Cresswell was not an obvious appointment. A mercantile lawyer who had been somewhat diffident as a junior judge in the Court of Common Pleas, Cresswell was a bachelor with a reputation for impatience and a short temper. However, he succeeded superbly in establishing the authority, dignity and efficiency of the new regime. In the first year of operation of the Act, there were three hundred divorce petitions, as against three in the previous year and there were fears of chaos. Campbell sat in some of the earliest hearings but was afraid that he had created a \\"Frankenstein\\". However, Cresswell took a managerial role in regulating the new flood of litigation. He showed great sensitivity in dealing with genuine grievances but upheld the sanctity of marriage and was capable of being severe when necessary. However, he was also instrumental in moving the legal view of divorce from that based on a sacrament to that based on contract. He worked with colossal speed and energy, deciding over one thousand cases in six years, only one of which was reversed on appeal. He achieved some public fame and huge respect, popularly being held as representing the five million married women of Britain. The Act was also an important enabling step in unifying and rationalising the legal system of England and Wales, a process that was largely effected by the Judicature Acts (1873‚Äì1875). It also catalysed the unification of the legal profession. By the abolition of any remaining important role for canon lawyers, it ultimately led to the demise of the Doctors' Commons.[Anon.] (2001) \\"Doctors' Commons\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica  Overseas impact  The Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 also had impact in some of Britain's overseas possessions. In a series of decisions, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the Act was part of the local law of the four western provinces of Canada, having been received by those provinces under the doctrine of the reception of English statute law. In 1930, the Parliament of Canada extended its application to the province of Ontario. The Act formed the basis for divorce law in those provinces until the Parliament passed a uniform Divorce Act in 1968 which applied nationwide.

It was established at Chatham in Kent in 1888. The School moved to Stanhope Lines, Aldershot in 1890 when a balloon section and depot were formed as permanent units of the Royal Engineers establishment. The School was sometimes known as the Balloon Factory. Origins In 1862 two Royal Engineers officers, who had seen balloons being used in the American Civil War, drew the attention of the War Office to the potential use of balloons for observation. These officers demonstrated balloons to the army, but it was only in 1878 that the War Office directed Captain James Templer, an army reservist and experienced balloonist, to set up a small unit of Royal Engineers which became known as the School of Ballooning. History ;At Woolwich Initially the School was based at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. In 1878 the school constructed and flew a hydrogen- filled balloon of capacity. By 1879 the unit had five balloons. In 1880 military balloon training and demonstration took place at Aldershot. After a tragic incident in 1881 Templer concentrated on development of balloons rather than making ascents himself. ;At Chatham In 1882 the School moved to the School of Military Engineering at Chatham where they discovered that Goldbeater's skin was superior balloon fabric than the material they had used previously ‚Äì in particular it was easier to stow for transport. Templer also took out a patent for the use of unmanned balloons for \\"balloon photography\\" of the ground below. ;At Aldershot In 1890 the School moved to Aldershot where a section of the Royal Engineers had been formed to use balloons operationally. The School of Ballooning was renamed the Balloon Factory in 1897. In 1899 the Factory increased production to supply balloons for use in the Boer War. The Factory began experiments with \\"dirigible balloons\\" (airships) in 1902. ;At Farnborough Nulli Secundus The Aldershot site was found to be too enclosed so in 1904-1906 the Factory moved to a site at the edge of Farnborough Common. A high airship shed was built at there. Samuel Cody experimented with man-lifting kites at the site. In 1906 he was appointed as Chief Instructor in Kiting. In 1906 Colonel John Capper took up command of the School of Ballooning. During his time in command, Capper contributed to the development of Britain's military airships and, with Cody, piloted the first successful British airship flight, that of the Nulli Secundus over London during 1907.Royal Engineers Museum History Section - Aeronautics, Royal Engineers Museum and Library, Retrieved 15 August 2007 In 1909‚Äì1911, part of the Factory was separated to form the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers. In 1912 the Balloon Factory was renamed the Royal Aircraft Factory. Commanders The following officers served as superintendent of the Balloon Factory: *1878 to ?, Captain J L B Templer *1901 to May 1906 Colonel J L B Templer *1906 to 1909, Colonel J E Capper In 1909, the Balloon Factory was separated from the Balloon School. Colonel Capper continued as commander of the Balloon School, and the civilian consultant engineer Mervyn O'Gorman was appointed superintendent of the Balloon Factory.

MEHARI enables business managers, information security/risk management professionals and other stakeholders to evaluate and manage the organization's risks relating to information, information systems and information processes (not just IT). It is designed to align with and support information security risk management according to ISO/IEC 27005, particularly in the context of an ISO/IEC 27001-compliant Information Security Management System (ISMS) or a similar overarching security management or governance framework. History MEHARI has steadily evolved since the mid-1990s to support standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002, ISO/IEC 27005 and NIST's SP 800-30. The current version of MEHARI Expert (2010) includes links and support for ISO 27001/27002:2013 revision ISMS. Description MEHARI Expert (2010) combines a powerful and extendible knowledge base with a flexible suite of tools supporting the following information security risk analysis and management activities: * Threat analysis: top business managers describe the organization's activities, list the potential issues or concerns that might adversely affect those activities, and assign values to the business impacts. * The business processes are analyzed further in order to identify and map out the associated organizational, human and technical assets. * The assets are classified according to three classic security criteria (confidentiality, integrity, availability) plus the need for compliance to applicable laws and regulations (e.g. to protect personal information or the environment). * The intrinsic likelihood/probability of representative threat event types is considered. * These elements are combined automatically to analyze and assess the intrinsic severity of risks (based on 800 'scenarios' in the knowledgebase), highlighting the most critical and serious ones according to the projected business consequences. * Diagnostic questionnaires help users evaluate the ability of their existing information security measures/controls to mitigate risks. * Security measures (organizational and technical) are grouped into services for discussion with the relevant managers and professionals. * The current severity level of each risk scenario is displayed, taking account of the effectiveness of existing security measures, giving an indication of the current information security risk landscape and suggesting the prioritization of remedial work. * Action plans and security projects can be selected to manage the risks, based on the expected effectiveness of additional security measures and the timescales for their implementation. The preceding analysis enables management to appreciate the business benefits of, and hence justify, appropriate investment in information security: the entire process is business-driven. MEHARI Expert (2010)'s comprehensive knowledgebase, built using Excel, is available in both English and French as an interactive tool, or more accurately a suite of tools that can be used individually but are designed as a coherent suite. As the process proceeds, the knowledgebase automatically expands with the information obtained, providing inputs for subsequent steps. Consistent analysis of the risks and controls enables large, diverse organizations to compare and contrast operating units on an even footing. Additional applications and tools, based on the same principles, may be developed under Creative Commons license.

The film is set in pre-Civil War Kansas. Darcy leads a gang which seeks to take advantage of Bleeding Kansas (loosely based on abolitionist John Brown); Bleeker joins the gang. The supporting cast features Henry Silva and Leo Gordon. Plot summary In the days before the Civil War, the Kansas Territory is torn by fighting over whether Kansas should enter the Union as a free state or a slave state. Cam Bleeker, a farmer who went to prison for leading a gang of raiders himself, breaks out of prison and rides to his home. A stranger, Jeanne Dubois, is living there with her two young children. She now owns the place. Bleeker's wife's grave is outside the house, along with the grave of Dubois' late husband. Mrs. Bleeker died under mysterious circumstances. Bleeker says he broke out of prison when he heard she was involved with another man. Dubois says Mrs. Bleeker's grave was there when the Dubois family bought the place six months ago. Dubois' husband was shot dead by Missouri Redlegs raiders right after the family arrived. Dubois, telling Bleeker there's a reward out for him and she could turn him in, convinces him to stay at the farm because she can't run it by herself. But the sheriff finds out Bleeker is there, and government soldiers come and take Bleeker away. He is brought to Gov. William Clayton, who makes a deal with Bleeker: Bleeker won't hang if he can go and capture Luke Darcy and bring him to justice, any way he can. Darcy is a dangerous, frontier dictator whose raiders threaten to take over the whole territory. Clayton twists Bleeker's arm into tracking down Darcy by revealing that it was Darcy ‚Äì a serial seducer of women ‚Äì who destroyed Bleeker's wife. But Clayton warns Bleeker not to cross him‚Äîhe wants Darcy taken alive. Bleeker comes upon a hanging party in progress, involving Darcy gang members, and manages to snatch one of the condemned away and forces him to take him to Darcy, who has just taken over a town. Inside the saloon headquarters, Bleeker introduces himself to Darcy, and demonstrates his talents as a fighter, convincingly enough to be allowed to join Darcy's gang. Darcy warily accepts him, and as they become acquainted, reveals to Bleeker how he goes about his \\"war\\" to take over Kansas, by raiding town after town. He also brazenly reveals what happened to Bleeker's wife. \\"To me a woman is like a wine\\", he says, \\"something to be enjoyed. When it's over and there's nothing left in the bottle, you must throw it away and find another.\\" Darcy's wife was such a victim of his, but Darcy uses some fast-talking psychology and a claim that it was a consensual affair to blunt Bleeker's thoughts of revenge, and he stays with the gang. During a raid at Knight's Crossing, a town near the Dubois farm, horsemen unintentionally run down and injure Dubois' daughter. Bleeker, still wearing his gang garb, takes her home. Dubois sees that her daughter is still alive, but is enraged about Bleeker's complicity in Darcy's methods, which put the lives of innocents at risk. Bleeker promises it won't happen again. After they take the girl to the doctor, Bleeker goes to have another talk with the governor. Bleeker has devised a plan to set a trap to catch Darcy. Bleeker found out that there's a train due in to Abilene with a load of gold. Bleeker's plan is to have the gang raid Abilene so it can be there when the gold train arrives. What Darcy won't know is that the governor will have filled the train with federal troops, turning it into a Trojan Horse to catch the gang. Clayton agrees to the plan, but reminds Bleeker not to cross him. Bleeker sells Darcy on going after the gold, because it will be enough to buy half a million dollars' worth of arms and clear the way to victory in Darcy's war. So the gang goes ahead and infiltrates Abilene, takes over the town, and waits for the train to arrive. While they're waiting, Darcy tells Bleeker and Dubois (now on the scene as a willing accomplice) that it's time for them to leave, to go build a life for themselves somewhere else. He says in parting, \\"Don't worry about me. I got what I want. I got Kansas.\\" But Bleeker still has to finish his job for the governor. He knows Darcy has a dread of hanging, though, so before the trap swings shut he decides to confront Darcy and settle things between themselves, no matter what the governor said about taking him alive. Just before he meets Darcy at his saloon headquarters, however, Lordan, a gang member who has found out about the trap, reaches Darcy to warn him about it. Bleeker enters the saloon, now full of gang members, including Darcy, who, informed that the troops are here, orders his men to get out of town. Then he faces Bleeker alone. The two of them get into a fistfight, which Bleeker wins. But as he begins to take Darcy at gunpoint outside to face the gallows, Darcy talks bitterly about the imminent \\"carnival\\" of a hanging, and Bleeker -- \\"Darcy, you talk too much\\", he says‚Äîdecides on a gun duel. Bleeker kills Darcy in the duel, though it appears that Darcy might have mis-aimed his shot intentionally. Bleeker, having broken his agreement by shooting Darcy, goes outside to surrender. But the governor, hearing Bleeker's reason, tells him, \\"Bleeker, you don't know why you couldn't let him hang, and I don't know why I'm letting you go free. But I've got a feeling we're both right.\\" Cast * Jeff Chandler as Luke Darcy * Fess Parker as Cam Bleeker * Nicole Maurey as Jeanne Dubois * Henry Silva as Lordan * Herbert Rudley as Gov.

They bought the story in January 1957. Panama and Frank were best known for their comedies and had made a comic Western, Callaway Went Thataway but The Jayhawkers was serious. Frank said at the time: > The world has changed in eight years. This is no time to satirize western > myth; people won't stand for the making fun of something sacred. Actually, > why The Jayhawkers is in the outdoor category and has outlaws and guns and > horses, it's a western only in that it takes place on the then-frontier of > 1859. Something frightening happened in Kansas on the eve of the Civil > War... A man on horseback tried to become A Man on Horseback. He took over > only a few towns- but what would've happened if he'd seized Kansas for his > empire and the Civil War had allowed him to set up a kingdom in the West? > The power mad character has always threatened freedom. We had long wanted to > use this theme in a story about the American past and when we found this > story... it clicked. Panama and Frank subjected the script to analysis by a psychological consulting firm. Melvin Frank tried to interest Vivien Leigh in the female lead. Chandler made the film on loan out from Universal International. Filming started 1 December 1958.

Its first production, I Remember Mama by John Van Druten, was staged in the auditorium of what is now Gulfview Middle School the night of March 20, 1953. The company staged its first musical, HMS Pinafore in 1958. The group performed where it could in its first 22 years of existence in the Naples area, from local schools and storefronts to homes. In 1975, they established a home base for the next decade when a 40-seat playhouse was opened at 2363 Davis Boulevard. In 1985, TNP converted the now demolished Kon-Tiki movie theatre on Goodlette- Frank Road.Information from the Explore Naples website As the years passed, both the membership and audience for the company grew. However, as TNP entered its fourth decade of existence in the mid-1990s, the Kon-Tiki Playhouse began to suffer from a crumbling facade and mechanical breakdowns, and it soon became clear that a new location was necessary. Following an unprecedented fund raising campaign, and a partnership with City of Naples in choosing a suitable location, over $6 million was raised to build the Sugden Community Theatre in downtown Naples on a site provided by the City, which was completed in 1998. The Sugden Theatre sits only two blocks south of Gulfview Middle School, where TNP staged its first production in 1953. Today, the company stages productions year-round, has a dues paying membership of 500 plus, and features the talents of volunteer actors, directors, designers and crew drawn from across Southwest Florida. The Theatre currently plays to an audience of over 65,000 patrons and season subscription holders annually. Performance schedule The Players' annual performance season includes seven main stage and four studio productions of more than 240 performances per year. The Players also present five KidzAct productions annually. KidzAct Youth Theatre Program Thoroughly Modern Millie KidzAct (Teen Cast) 2009 KidzAct is the youth theatre and theatre education program of The Naples Players, founded in 2002. While TNP had traditionally produced a youth musical in the summer, an initiative was begun in the early 2000s to create a year-round educational theatre program featuring skills-building and production classes to children and young adults ranging from 4‚Äì18 years of age. The Kidzact program now stages five productions annually. Children audition to be admitted to the production classes, which make use in applying what the students learn in the skills building sections of the classes. There is a full-time director of KidzAct and contracted teachers specializing in voice, dance, improvisation, and acting. Scholarships to the program are available based on financial need.Information about the kids program from the Naples Players website In the spring of 2007, KidzAct began an Outreach program. The program teams with local businesses and private donors to present plays in schools which do not have any type of a theatre program. The program does not displace any existing teachers at the chosen school. Performance facilities The Sugden Community Theatre building includes two main performance spaces, two sprung floor rehearsal halls, a music room and library, scenic and costume construction shops, plus ticket and administrative offices for the full-time staff. It is located at 701 5th Avenue South. The Lobby of the Sugden Community Theatre Blackburn Hall Tobye Studio Theatre Blackburn Hall Blackburn Hall is a 326-seat proscenium theatre, with \\"European\\" style seating, meaning the aisles are located on the left and right sides of the auditorium. The theatre features an orchestra pit and fly tower with 29 lines of rigging to \\"fly\\" scenery and lights from overhead. There are four motorized lines dedicated to stage lighting, and 25 lines available for scenic use. The stage features a sprung floor which consists of plywood and pine strips constructed with rubber cushioning. This type of flooring \\"gives\\" on impact to reduce and prevent foot and leg injuries to dancers. Blackburn Hall is the \\"mainstage\\" performance space of the company, as well as the KidzAct program. Tobye Studio Theatre The Tobye Studio Theatre is a 100-seat \\"Black Box\\" theatre in stage parlance. It is a flexible performance space, meaning the layout of the theatre can be changed to offer different seating and performance environments depending on need. The Tobye Studio has allowed the company to perform \\"edgier\\" material not necessarily suitable for a mainstage environment such as The Goat or Who is Sylvia?,The Laramie Project'\\". It is also used as a forum for more intimate stagings of classic plays such as The Lion In Winter and The Glass Menagerie. The space is also used for KidzAct program performances and staged play readings through the company's \\"ETC...\\" program. Critical reception In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine cited the company in naming Naples, Florida the Ninth \\"Best Small Town In America\\". In 2008 CNN and Money Magazine cited the company while recognizing Collier County, Florida as one of its \\"Best Places for a Long Life In The United States\\".

The name is an acronym of \\"Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite\\" or, in French, D√©termination d'Orbite et Radiopositionnement Int√©gr√© par Satellite. Principle Ground-based radio beacons emit a signal which is picked up by receiving satellites. This is in reverse configuration to other GNSS, in which the transmitters are space-borne and receivers are in majority near the surface of the Earth. A frequency shift of the signal occurs that is caused by the movement of the satellite (Doppler effect). From this observation satellite orbits, ground positions, as well as other parameters can be derived. Organization DORIS is a French system which was initiated and is maintained by the French Space Agency (CNES). It is operated from Toulouse. Ground segment The UHF transmitting antenna of DORIS ground station at Dionysos, Greece The ground segment includes about 50-60 ground stations, equally distributed over the earth and ensure a good coverage for orbit determination. For the installation of a beacon only electricity is required because the station only emits a signal but does not receive any information. DORIS beacons transmit to the satellites on two UHF frequencies, 401.25 MHz and 2036.25 MHz. Australian ground segments There are two active DORIS stations in Australia: * Yatharagga - Active * Orroral Valley Tracking Station - No longer active. * Mount Stromlo Observatory - Currently active, replaced Orroral Valley Tracking station installation Space segment The best known satellites equipped with DORIS receivers are the altimetry satellites TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason 1, Jason 2, and Jason 3. They are used to observe the ocean surface as well as currents or wave heights. DORIS contributes to their orbit accuracy of about 2 cm. Other DORIS satellites are the Envisat, SPOT, HY-2A and CryoSat-2 satellites. Positioning Apart from orbit determination, the DORIS observations are used for positioning of ground stations. The accuracy is a bit lower than with GPS, but it still contributes to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).  See also  *Argos (satellite system) ReferencesFurther reading * G.

The town at that point was short of facilities and YMCA provided recreational opportunities that included football, athletics, stallball, cricket, cycling, first aid, an overseas mission, libraries and Bible studies. During the Second World War (1939‚Äì45) YMCA Horsham helped local people by providing care for Service personnel. This included the founding of a youth centre in North Street for young Canadians who were billeted in Horsham during the period. Youth programmes continued until the sixties when the Boys Club opened in Hurst Road. YMCA chose to concentrate on their football programme at Horsham YMCA F.C. and to expand their operations into other social concerns that affected young people. Current operations During the 1990s the Horsham District Council area faced a problem in meeting government targets for providing accommodation for young people. YMCA at Guildford, a town about twenty-five miles from Horsham, provided an example of where YMCA had effectively worked with a local authority. The facilities in Guildford included a restaurant and conference facility with programmes for the disabled and the very young. There was accommodation for 132 residents and since the opening of the Guildford YMCA they had operated a summer camp scheme with over 500 young people taking part, organised personal development trips to India, opened a Youth Caf√© and Advice Centre with a doctor and nurse available 3 sessions a week. 23 youth workers were employed in schools, the local church, caf√© and helping disaffected young people. A proposal was made to YMCA in Horsham for a similar offer of services and programmes. As a consequence of the alliance between YMCA led by a former CEO Alex Cloke and Horsham District Council, YMCA provides 48 single flats for young people and supports this by a qualified staff partly funded by the Horsham District council. The new building, known as 'The Y Centre' was constructed under a Design & Build Contract by Dean & Dyball Construction Limited with Hurley, Porte and Duell as project architects.

Sadhu-bhasha was used only in writing, unlike Cholito-bhasa, the colloquial form of the language, which was used in both writing and speaking. These two literary forms are examples of diglossia. Sadhu-bhasha was practised in official documents and legal papers during the colonial period however it is mostly obsolete in the present day. History This Sanskritised form of Bengali is notable for its variations in verb forms and the vocabulary which is mainly composed of Sanskrit or tatsama words. It was mainly a vocabulary making it easier for literary works in Sanskrit to be translated. Notable among them was Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, who standardised the Bengali alphabet and paved the path for literary works. The colloquial usage of Bengali consisted mostly of its Pali base as well as indigenous (deshi), Persian and Arabic words embedded into the vocabulary. As a result, the Brahmins, a Hindu pundit caste, chose the path of Sanskritisation to make a \\"pure\\" language which would be used as a representative of classical languages into which the works of Sanskrit and Hindu literature can be translated. This shifted Bengali from its original Pali roots towards Sanskrit. This in turn increased the commonality in Bengali vocabulary with other Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindi. By the time of Rabindranath Tagore, the Sadhu-ness (\\"purity\\") of the literary form had largely waned into just a set of Sanskrit verb forms and in a decade, Tagore himself would switch to writing in Cholito Bhasha. Dr. Radha Nag's book Atmaghati Nirad Choudhuri ‡¶Ü‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Æ‡¶ò‡¶æ‡¶§‡ßÄ ‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶∞‡¶¶ ‡¶ö‡ßå‡¶ß‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßÄ (Suicidal Nirad Choudhuri) appears as the last Bengali book written in Sadhu Bhasha. Bangladeshi writer, intellectual, academic Dr. Salimullah Khan has been writing in Sadhu Basha since 2005. Styles The mid-19th century hosted two influential writers of Sadhu-bhasha; Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee. Vidyasagar's style was very conservative towards withholding only the use of tatsama (Sanskrit) when writing. His style came to be known as Vidyasagari and Akshay Kumar Datta also wrote in this style. Chatterjee's writing style was somewhat more lenient to the use of tadbhava and deshi vocabulary. It came to be known as Bankimi ‚Äì a more popular style, it was practised by the likes of Rabindranath Tagore, Hara Prasad Shastri, Dinesh Chandra Sen, Mir Mosharraf Hossain and Ismail Hossain Siraji.

Getzville's ZIP code is 14068, and its post office is located on Millersport Highway (NY 263). Geography  Getzville is located in western New York and is northeast of Buffalo. Getzville is located centrally within the town of Amherst, the hamlet center being at the intersection of Campbell Boulevard (NY 270) and Dodge Road (CR 45).  History  Getzville received its name from Joseph Goetz, who was a postmaster and owner of a copper shop and mill. The settlement grew to have a predominantly German population. By the mid 1860s many of the large farms around town were owned by German immigrants, as well as several of the shops in town. In these early days most of the residents were farmers, so the few shops in town catered to agricultural needs. In town, there was a stave factory and a cooperage, important because barrels were needed to store most foodstuffs and beverages such as cider and beer. There was also a creamery, a cider mill, a surgeon, and lumber shop. The hamlet consisted of one main road running north‚Äìsouth and a center area bounded by a cross street on the north and the railroad on the south. The businesses were clustered in the center of town, with farms surrounding. New Home Road became what is today Campbell Boulevard, and Lintz Street is now Dodge Road. Getzville station in May 2015 In 1855, the single track of the new Canandaigua-Niagara Falls Railroad opened with a station at Getzville. This railroad became known locally as the \\"Peanut Line\\" because of its small size and relative insignificance. It was later operated by the New York Central until it was discontinued in the late 1950s.  Schools  The Getzville area is served by the Williamsville Central School District. Schools in this district that students attend include: Heim Elementary School, Dodge elementary, Heim Middle School, Casey Middle School and Williamsville North High School.  Fire and police services  Fire protection for the Getzville area is provided by the Getzville Fire Company which operates two stations. Station One, the larger of the two, is located on the corner of Campbell Boulevard (NY 270) and Dodge Road. Station Two is located on the corner of North Forest and Heim Roads. Since Getzville resides within the town of Amherst, it is served by the Amherst Police Department.

It generates a security policy adapted to the needs of an organization. The method was created in 1995 and is now maintained by the ANSSI, a department of the French Prime Minister. The five steps of the EBIOS method are: # Circumstantial study - determining the context; # Security requirements; # Risk study; # Identification of security goals; and # Determination of security requirements. EBIOS is primarily intended for governmental and commercial organizations working with the Defense Ministry that handle confidential or secret defense classified information. It enables well informed security actions to be undertaken. The objective is to assess and prepare for possible future situations (in the case of a newly created information system), and identify and respond to deficiencies (when the system is operating) in order to refine the security arrangements. In its first version, EBIOS was focused on ‚Äúsecurity objectives redaction‚Äù. Since 2000, DCSSI became aware of improvements in international standards (ISO in particular) and ‚Äúengaged EBIOS adaptation to this criteria‚Äù. It might also be viewed as a way to avoid France‚Äôs introspective approach to information security, responding to the limitations of French methods that are not recognized abroad and are unsuited to international markets. However, the method's documentation only appears to be available in French.

It was fought between men of the Clan Mackay and men of the Clan Sutherland whose chiefs were the Gordon, Earls of Sutherland. Background=Sir Robert Gordon's account 17th-century historian, Sir Robert Gordon, who himself was a son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, wrote an account of the background events leading up to the battle: Gordon states that there was peace between the Mackays and Sutherlands from the death of John Mackay in 1529 until the year 1542 when chief \\"Donald Mackay came with a company of men to the village of Knockartel, burnt the same, and took a prey of goods from Strathbrory\\".. He goes on to say that the goods were soon recovered and that soon afterwards Donald Mackay again invaded Sutherland and marched as far as Skibo Castle and encamped there. Angus Mackay's account Historian Angus Mackay disputes the version of background events given by Sir Robert Gordon. Angus Mackay states that Robert Stuart, Bishop of Caithness, having departed for England to join his brother the Earl of Lennox, made some arrangements with his relatives, the Earl of Caithness and Donald Mackay, for the protection of his castles and church-lands. As such the Earl of Caithness occupied Scrabster Castle which was near Thurso and Donald Mackay, having advanced into Sutherland, placed a party of his clansmen in Skibo Castle, under the command of Neil Mackay of the Mackay of Aberach branch of the Clan Mackay. The battle Neither the Mackay historians nor the 1813 publication of Sir Robert Gordon's History of the Earldom of Sutherland mention an actual battle. However, an account of the Battle of Alltan-Beath was written in the book Conflicts of the Clans which was published by the Foulis Press in 1764 and which was based on Gordon's original 17th century manuscript. Donald Mackay of Strathnaver, having succeeded his brother, John, taketh the occasion upon the death of Adam, Earl of Sutherland (who left his grandchild, John, young to succeed him) to molest and invade the inhabitants of Sutherland. He came, the year of God 1542, with a company of men to the village of Knockartoll, burnt the same, and took a great prey of goods out of Strathbrora. Sir Hugh Kennedy of Griffen Mains dwelt then in Sutherland, having married John, Earl of Sutherland's mother, after the death of his father, Alexander, Master of Sutherland. Sir Hugh Kennedy being advertised of Mackay's coming into Sutherland, he advises with Hutcheon Murray of Abirscors, and with Gilbert Gordon of Garty, what was best to be done. They resolve to fight the enemy; and so having gathered a company of men, they overtook Mackay, unawares, beside a place called Ailtan-Beath, where they invaded him suddenly; having passed his spies unseen. After a little skirmish the Strathnaver men fled, the booty was rescued, and John MacIan-MacAngus, one of their chieftains, was slain, with divers of the Strathnaver men. Donald Mackay, nevertheless, played the part of a good soldier; for in his flight he killed, with his own hand, one William Sutherland, who most eagerly pursued him in the chase. The inhabitants of Sutherland and Strathnaver (in regard of Earl John's minority) did thus continually vex one another, until this Donald Mackay was apprehended and imprisoned in the Castle of Fowlis, in Ross, by commandment of the Queen Regent and the Governor, where he continued a good while in captivity. Aftermath=Sir Robert Gordon's account Sir Robert Gordon, son of the Earl of Sutherland goes onto say that in that year: The Gordon Earl of Huntly and Gordon Earl of Sutherland both coming north into Sutherland, they did summon Sinclair, Earl of Caithness and Donald Mackay to compear before them at Helmsdale, to answer for their intromission with the bishop's rents, and for the wrongs which they had done, and caused to be done upon the bishop's lands. The Earl of Caithness compeared at the time and place appointed, and yielded himself to their mercy. So, having made a final agreement with them at Helmsdale, he returned again into Caithness. Donald Mackay was also at this time brought to the Earls of Huntly and Sutherland, who (upon Mackay's submission) pardoned him what was past; yet he was at their command imprisoned in the castle of Foulis. Angus Mackay's account This version of events is however disputed by historian Angus Mackay who says that Sir Robert Gordon described it with his \\"usual untruthfulness\\". Mackay also quotes historian Sir William Fraser who shows that at the time the Earl of Cathness was sitting hospitably entertaining friends in Castle Sinclair Girnigoe when by contrast Sir Robert Gordon describes him as having been \\"sprawling in the river of Helmsdale with the terror of the Gordons upon him\\". Angus Mackay also disputes the account that Donald Mackay of Strathnaver was even taken prisoner. Mackay's escape from Foulis Castle 17th-century historian Sir Robert Gordon writes of Mackay's imprisonment at Foulis: \\"where he continued a good while in captivity; from whence he escaped by means of Donald MacK-ean-voyr, (Mackay) a Strathnaver man, who advised him to flee away\\". 19th-century historian Alexander Mackenzie wrote in his book the History of the Munros of Fowlis (1898): \\"In this year 1542, a feud broke out between Donald Mackay, Chief of the Clan Mackay, and John Gordon, 15th Earl of Sutherland, during which Mackay committed several depredations. He was ultimately apprehended, and by order of the Gordon Earl of Huntly, Lieutenant of the North, was imprisoned in Fowlis Castle, where he was kept for a considerable time in captivity. He however managed to make his escape through the connivance of one Donald Mackay, a Strathnaver man; and it seems highly probable that Baron Robert Munro of Fowlis was cognisant of the plan adopted to effect the liberation of his prisoner, as the Mackays and Munros were for generations on very friendly terms\\".

Their music is often compared to that of Queensr√øche or Iron Maiden.  Background  The band was formed out of a general market metal band known as Nomad, which formed in 1985. Subsequent to the conversion of guitarist Bruce Swift to Christianity, he led fellow band members Tony Velasquez and Rey Parra. He also converted Rick Macias, who had been a bouncer at a nightclub. Their first album, Rebellion, was released in 1988 and supported its release on a tour with Rez in 1989. Later that year, Master's Command was released, featuring guest vocals from Vengeance Rising frontman Roger Martinez. Their third release, Wicked Generation, was considered a partial concept album about a young person struggling with life seeking hope. Their fourth and final album from the 1990s was Obsessions, a more straightforward melodic metal album. The band initially broke up in 1994. The band performed at a reunion show in 2001 at the Cornerstone Festival which was recorded and released on CD later that year. In 2008, the band reformed and began performing shows. Keyboardist Rick Macias died on February 9, 2009. On April 23, 2012, lead vocalist Rey Parra announced he has left the band due to time constraints and distance issues. He lives in Florida, while the rest of the band is from the Chicago, Illinois area. Parra rejoined the band in 2016 and released the single \\"Slave\\" in advance of a full album. He left Sacred Warrior again in 2019 to focus on a new band after releasing \\"Blood River\\" as a single. In 2020, after a nationwide search, Erik Schelling, another native to Chicagoland, joined the band as lead vocalist.

The phantom consists of 10 polyethylene bottles, either cylinders or elliptical cylinders, that represent the head, neck chest, abdomen, thighs, calves, and arms. Each section is filled with a radioactive solution, in water, that has the amount of radioactivity proportional to the volume of each section. This simulates a homogeneous distribution of material throughout the body. The solution will also be acidified and contain stable element carrier so that the radioactivity does not plate out on the container walls. The phantom, which contains a known amount of radioactivity can be used to calibrate the whole body counter by relating the observed response to the known amount of radioactivity. As different radioactive materials emit different energies of gamma photons, the calibration has to be repeated to cover the expected energy range: usually 120 to 2,000 keV. Examples of radioactive isotopes that are used for efficiency calibration include 57Co, 60Co, 88Y, 137Cs and 152Eu. Although the phantom was designed to be used lying down, it is used in any orientation.

In 1986, his work with the corporation lead to his appointment as chairman of its General Advisory Council. Through his friendship with Harold Wilson, Hunt was able to promote reform of the civil service and devolution, two issues on which he felt deeply. During Wilson's first term as Prime Minister, he served on the Committee on the Civil Service (1966‚Äì1968; chaired by Lord Fulton), and was appointed to the Royal Commission on the Constitution, chaired by Lord Crowther and later Lord Kilbrandon, in 1969. On 9 July 1973, he was awarded a life peerage as Baron Crowther-Hunt, of Eccleshill in the West Riding of the County of York. To develop the government's devolution proposals following Wilson's return to power, Crowther-Hunt became a constitutional adviser to the government from March to October 1974. He then served as Minister of State, Education and Science until 1976, when he became Minister of State for the Privy Council Office, when he again dealt with devolution issues. Disillusioned by the government's narrow, party-political attitude to devolution and obstructions to civil service reform, he returned to full-time teaching at Exeter College in 1976. He became Rector in 1982, a position in which he served until his death from a heart attack in 1987.

Ottawa was the first bilingual ship to serve in the Canadian navy.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 248 Design and description Two St. Laurent-class destroyers in their original configuration The need for the St. Laurent class came about in 1949 when Canada joined NATO and the Cold War was in its infancy. The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) was assigned responsibility for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and controlling sea space in the western North Atlantic. The St Laurent class were built to an operational requirement much like that which produced the British Type 12, and were powered by the same machinery plant. The rounded deck-edge forward was adopted to prevent ice forming.Friedman, p. 161 The vessels were designed to operate in harsh Canadian conditions. They were built to counter nuclear, biological and chemical attack conditions, which led to a design with a rounded hull, a continuous main deck, and the addition of a pre-wetting system to wash away contaminants. The living spaces on the ship were part of a \\"citadel\\" which could be sealed off from contamination for the crew safety. The ships were sometimes referred to as \\"Cadillacs\\" for their relatively luxurious crew compartments; these were also the first Canadian warships to have a bunk for every crew member since previous warship designs had used hammocks.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 9‚Äì11 As built, the ships were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 17 The destroyer escorts displaced standard and at deep load.Conway's says 2000 tons standard displacement, 2600 deep load. The destroyer escorts had a crew of 12 officers and 237 enlisted. Armament The St. Laurent class was fitted with twin /L50 caliber guns in two mounts for engaging both surface and air targets. The ships were also fitted with two single-mounted guns. The class's anti-submarine armament consisted of a pair of triple-barreled Mk. NC 10 Limbo ASW mortars in a stern well. The stern well had a roller top to close it off from following seas. As with the British Type 12 design, the provision for long-range homing torpedoes (in this case BIDDER [Mk 20E] or the US Mark 35 were included. However, they were never fitted. Machinery The vessels of the St. Laurent class had two Babcock & Wilcox water tube boilers installed. The steam produced by these boilers was directed at two geared steam turbines which powered two shafts, providing to drive the ship at a maximum speed of .Blackman, p. 35 The ships had an endurance of at . DDH conversion Following successful trials aboard the frigate and Ottawa, plans to convert the St. Laurent class took shape.Soward 1995, pp. 63‚Äì65Blackman, pp. 35, 37 Th development of the beartrap, installed in during her 1962‚Äì63 conversion, finalized the concept. By keeping the aircraft secure, the beartrap eliminated the need for deck handling from landing to the hangar, or from hangar to takeoff. In the conversion to a helicopter-carrying vessel, Ottawa was gutted except for machinery and some forward spaces. The hull was strengthened, fueling facilities for the helicopter and activated fin stabilizers installed. The fin stabilizers were to reduce roll in rough weather during helicopter operations.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 12‚Äì13 All seven St Laurents were fitted with helicopter platforms and SQS 504 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS). The single funnel was altered to twin stepped funnels to permit the forward extension of the helicopter hangar. To make room for the helicopter deck, the aft 3-inch mount and one of the Limbos were removed.Chumbley & Gardiner, p. 44 The two 40 mm guns were also removed. Following the conversion, the displacement remained the same at standard load but at full load, it increased to . DELEX program In the late 1970s, under the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program was commissioned to upgrade ten of the St. Laurent-class ships with new electronics, machinery, and hull upgrades and repairs. However, only enough was done to keep the ships in service into the late 1980s. For the St. Laurents, this meant hull and machinery repairs only.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 16 Construction and career Ottawa was laid down at Canadian Vickers in Montreal on 8 June 1951, the ship was launched on 29 May 1953. She was commissioned into the RCN on 10 November 1956 and initially carried the hull number DDE 229 as a destroyer escort. In 1957, Ottawa was used as a test ship for helicopter landing trials on a flight deck installed over the rear of the ship. Ottawa was transferred to the west coast where she joined the Second Canadian Escort Squadron. In February 1960, she sailed with sister ships and on an operational cruise to Hong Kong and Japan, performing training exercises with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. In March 1961, the same three ships deployed with the United States Navy's Carrier Division 17 off the coast of Hawaii.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 27, 29 Ottawa underwent conversion to a destroyer helicopter escort (DDH) at Victoria, British Columbia, performed by Victoria Machinery Depot beginning on 24 May 1963. The ship was officially reclassed with pennant DDH 229 on 21 October 1964. Ottawa recommissioned on 28 October 1964 and re-transferred to the east coast. On 15 July 1968 she became the first bilingual ship of Maritime Command. Designated a French Language Unit (FLU), this was to provide a primarily French-speaking unit in the navy, comparable to the Royal 22nd Regiment of the Canadian Army.Hadley et al., pp. 310‚Äì312 Ottawa remained a FLU until 1 April 1973.Hadley et al., p. 314 The ship was replaced by as the naval FLU.Hadley et al., p. 319 In 1976, Ottawa was among the escort for the royal yacht during a royal visit to Canada and took part in the major NATO naval exercise Teamwork '76. In 1977, with and , Ottawa visited the Soviet Union. Later in the year, the vessel joined STANAVFORLANT, NATO's standing naval force for two months. In 1981, while inspecting the boilers of Ottawa, cracks were found in the superheaters. This led to all the other remaining St. Laurent-class destroyers to be taken out of service for precautionary inspections. Repairs were affected within six months.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 13 Ottawa was selected by the Canadian Forces for the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program, and underwent the refit from 19 April to 26 November 1982 at her builder, Canadian Vickers. In June‚ÄìJuly 1988, the vessel performed a cruise of the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes. From 6‚Äì16 June 1991 Ottawa participated in the NATO naval exercise Ocean Safari 91. She was paid off from active service on 31 July 1992 at Halifax. In February 1994, the ship was sold to Global Shipping of Tampa, Florida. She was towed to India and broken up there in 1994.

He was editor of The Economist from 1938 to 1956. Early life and education Crowther was born in Headingley, Leeds on 13 May 1907. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School and Oundle School before gaining a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge to read modern languages, in which he took a first in 1928. He then changed to economics and was awarded an upper first class degree in 1929. He was elected president of the Cambridge Union Society in 1928. Donald Tyerman said of him that \\"Crowther's self-awareness and self-confidence were not so much asserted as taken for granted. But men who did well enough in life after Cambridge were in despair when they saw how sure it seemed that he would succeed in whatever he chose to do.\\" In 1929 he was awarded a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship. He spent a year at Yale, where he met his wife Peggy and then, while nominally attached to Columbia University, he spent a year on Wall Street. From 1931 he worked in a London merchant bank and on the recommendation of John Maynard Keynes became an advisor on banking to the Irish Government. He married Peggy in 1932 and after a further recommendation from Keynes joined the staff of The Economist in the same year. The Economist He joined The Economist in 1932 and was made deputy editor in 1935. In August 1938, he succeeded Walter Layton to become, at the age of 31, the youngest editor in the newspaper's history. Under his editorship, The Economist's circulation grew fivefold. It became one of the most influential journals in the world and \\"made greater progress in every way than in any similar period in its history\\". He nurtured the careers of a number of distinguished journalists and writers, including Roland Bird, Donald Tyerman, Barbara Ward, Isaac Deutscher, John Midgley, Norman Macrae, Margaret Cruikshank, Helen Hill Miller, Marjorie Deane, Nancy Balfour, Donald McLachlan, Keith Kyle, Andrew Boyd and George Steiner. He was particularly supportive of the careers of women at a time when this was remarkable in the newspaper world. He resigned in 1956 after serving seventeen and a half years, just one month longer than Layton. He had become a director of Economist Newspaper Ltd. in 1947 and on his resignation as editor he became managing director. In 1963 he succeeded Layton as chairman. Public service During the Second World War he joined the Ministry of Supply and was for a time at the Ministry of Information, before being appointed deputy head of joint war production staff at the Ministry of Production. In 1956, he was appointed Chairman of the Central Advisory Council for Education. The result was The Crowther Report ‚Äì Fifteen to Eighteen, which eventually led, in 1972, to the raising of the school leaving age to 16, and in which he coined the word numeracy. In 1971, he authored the Report of the Committee on Consumer Credit, the \\"Crowther Report\\", whose recommendations led to the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Until his death in 1972, he was chairman of the Royal Commission on the Constitution. Other appointments Crowther served for several years on the board of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and was instrumental in insuring its survival during the war years. He served on the Council of the Royal Institute of International Affairs and from 1944 was for a time on the editorial board of International Affairs. He was editor of Translatlantic, a magazine published in the 1940s by Penguin Books, and was a regular participant on The Brains Trust on BBC radio. In education, he was a member of the governing body of the London School of Economics, and in 1969 he was appointed Foundation Chancellor of the Open University. Business At one point Crowther held as many as 40 directorships. His appointments included vice-chairman of Commercial Union, chairman of The Economist Group, Trust Houses Group, Trafalgar House and Hazell Sun as well as director of London Merchant Securities, Royal Bank of Canada, British Printing Corporation and Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc.. He was involved in ill-fated mergers at British Printing Corporation in 1966 and at Trust House Forte in 1970. Awards and honours Crowther became a Knight Bachelor in 1957, and was awarded a life peerage on 28 June 1968 and became Baron Crowther, of Headingley in the West Riding of the County of York. He also was awarded seven honorary degrees: * Honorary Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, 1958 * Hon LL.D. Nottingham, 1951 * Hon D.Sc (Econ.) London, 1954 * Hon LL.D. Swarthmore, 1957 * Hon LL.D.

Liverpool, 1961 Family Crowther's parents were Hilda Louise Reed (died 1950) and Charles Crowther (1876‚Äì1964), a professor of Agricultural Chemistry at the University of Leeds and then principal of Harper Adams Agricultural College in Shropshire from 1922 to 1944. He had an elder sister Phyllis who married and had two sons. His younger brother, Bernard Martin, followed him to Clare, from where, after obtaining a PhD in Physics and collaborating with Mark Oliphant, he, like Geoffrey, was awarded a Commonwealth Fund scholarship in 1939, before the war intervened. He was for many years the editor of Physics Abstracts. He married Peggy's younger sister, Anne, and had three children. The youngest of the three brothers, Donald Ineson, obtained a first in natural science at Magdalen College, Oxford and became an associate editor at the BMJ. He married and had five children. Crowther met Margaret Worth, who had won a scholarship to Yale Law School from Swarthmore College, in the library at Yale College in 1929. They married on 9 February 1932. They had six children. Their eldest child, Judith Vail, died in a car crash outside Boulogne-sur-Mer on 11 July 1955, aged 20. Crowther died of a heart attack at Heathrow Airport on 5 February 1972 at the age of 64.

Howard, the first of his Kull stories, set in his fictional Thurian Age. It was first published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales in August 1929. The story introduces Kull himself, the setting of Valusia, Brule the Spear-Slayer (a supporting character), and the Serpent Men (who don't appear in any other work by Howard, but were adopted by later authors for derivative works and inclusion in the Cthulhu Mythos). Plot The story starts shortly after Kull, a barbarian from Atlantis, has conquered Valusia and become its King. Kull is invited to a feast by the Pictish ambassador for Valusia, Ka-nu the Ancient. Despite the fact that the Picts are ancient enemies of the Atlanteans, Ka-nu confides in Kull and tells him to expect the arrival of Brule the Spear-Slayer around sunset. In the early night, Brule climbs into Kull's bedroom, identifying himself with a \\"bracelet of gold representing a winged dragon coiled thrice, with three horns of ruby on the head\\" which had been shown to Kull at the feast. Brule explains that Kull's life is in danger and shows him a series of secret passages which riddle the palace. Soon, Kull sees that the guards outside his room are all unconscious and their bodies hidden, although they still seem to be on guard at the same time. A visit by Chief Councillor Tu, with exposition from Brule, reveals the truth as Tu attempts to assassinate the sleeping King but meets him awake and armed; it was, however, not the real Tu but a serpent man who had taken on his appearance. Brule reveals that the Serpent Men, an ancient pre-human race who had founded Valusia but were almost extinct, rule from the shadows, using their Snake Cult religion and ability to disguise themselves with magic. They intended on replacing Kull with a disguised Serpent Man, just as they had done with his predecessors. The next day, the Serpent Men again attempt to replace Kull. He and Brule are, through an illusion, tricked into a separate room instead of the real council, surrounded by Serpent Men disguised as the councillors. Kull realizes the trap in time, however, and the two barely defeat their opponents. Heading into the real Council Room, they see another Kull. The imposter Kull is killed by the real one, revealing the fake as a Serpent Man and also revealing the truth of the existence of Serpent Men in general. The story ends with Kull's oath to hunt and destroy the Serpent Men for good. However, in \\"Delcardes Cat\\" Kull encounters what seems to be, though not explicitly, a community of serpent men living under a lake (like the nagas of Indian mythology, arguably the source of inspiration for the serpent men) close to his capital. There, he discovers their version of the conflict between serpent men and \\"true\\" men, learning that the same thing may look quite different from the other side of the square. Probably Kull did abandon his vow to destroy the serpent men after that. Quite clearly, the land that is Stygia in the days of Conan was the last stronghold of the serpent men, long after Kull. It was the conquerors coming from the east, perhaps ultimately ancient Mu, who destroyed the Serpent Men. Style The subjects of masks and identity are repeated throughout the story. The most obvious instance of this is the Serpent Men's ability of disguise through magic and their use of this to steal identities at will. Kull, as a barbarian, sees the diplomacy and politics of Valusia (and the others of the Seven Empires) as a form of illusion. Early in the story, before the Serpent Men appear, Kull's thoughts on the matter are described: Musing on his own identity later in the story, Kull extends the mask metaphor to himself: This is touched on again shortly afterwards when, on seeing a Serpent Man masquerading as himself, Kull is momentarily confused: Reception Robert Weinberg praised \\"The Shadow Kingdom\\" as \\"an exciting novelette of swords-and-sorcery\\".Robert Weinberg The Weird Tales Story.

This key battle occurred in the spring of 1405. The defeat of the Welsh rebels here was devastating and included the loss of important leaders and men. A contemporary Welsh chronicle described it as a ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù and that: ‚ÄúIt was now the tide began to turn against Owain and his men.‚ÄùAnnals of Owain Glyn Dwr, 1400‚Äì1415 Dating and location There is some confusion of the date of this battle and also its position in regard to another battle in Gwent at Grosmont.https://journals.library.wales/view/1337678/1340775/20#?xywh=845%2C1864%2C943%2C2187 However R.

Davies (2001) The location of the battle is the land immediately to the north of Usk Castle, towards Castle Farm and including what is now Castle Oak Pond. According to historian J. E.

It is a well-known spot and the name has never been lost.\\" Description Following a defeat at the Battle of Grosmont, the Welsh rebels were trying to regain the momentum in the North Gwent area. The battle began with a daring assault by Welsh forces, led by Gruffudd ab Owain Glynd≈µr against Usk Castle. The castle repulsed the attack and the Welsh retreated to the north. The garrison of Usk Castle, led by Richard Grey, 1st Baron Grey of Codnor, Sir John Greyndour, Dafydd Gam, and Sir John Oldcastle of Herefordshire, pursued the Welsh into the forest of Monkswood, Monmouthshire towards Mynydd Pwll Melyn - the 'Hill of the Yellow Pool'. Here, the English attacked and routed the Welsh forces. Adam of Usk‚Äôs contemporary description gives a vivid picture of the attacks on the retreating Welsh: ‚Äúthere slew with fire and the edge of the sword many of them, and above all the Abbot of Llanthony, and they crushed them without ceasing, driving them through the monk's wood, where the said Griffin (Owain's son) was taken.‚ÄùBattles and Campaigns from The Chronicle of Adam of Usk According to the Scottish chronicler Walter Bower, Dafydd Gam, a committed enemy of the rebellion, a Welshman originally from Brecon but holding land at Llantilio Crossenny, Monmouthshire, played a significant part in the English victory. Gam‚Äôs local knowledge and reputation might very well have been vital. He may have won over local Welshmen to fight against Glyndwr, or possibly may even have gained warning of the attack in advance.Dafydd Gam, Entry in the Dictionary of National Biography According to Adam of Usk, a main source of contemporary insight into the uprising, Usk Castle ‚Äúhad been put into some condition for defence‚Äù prior to the attack. Whether this strengthening represented a standard precautionary move considering the ongoing revolt or whether they had specific advance warning is uncertain, but to inflict such a heavy defeat on a large attacking force, their numbers probably were considerable and it seems that Gruffudd had no inkling of the strength of the numbers he faced inside Usk castle. It is perhaps significant that just two years earlier in 1403, Owain Glynd≈µr had burnt the town of Usk to the ground, with loss of life and property so local people may not have favoured his cause. The presence of such English leaders as Grey and Greyndor combined with men with excellent local knowledge and reputations as Dafydd Gam and John Oldcastle at the exact time of a Welsh attack does seem indicative if not conclusive of there being foreknowledge. Henry of Monmouth was in overall control of English forces fighting against the revolt at the time and was based in Hereford, though he does not seem to have been at the battle himself.  Casualties  Casualties on the Welsh side were heavy; they lost 1500 men according to some sources, a large number considering their heavy recent losses at Grosmont. According to Adam of Usk three hundred prisoners were beheaded in front of Usk Castle following the battle. Gruffudd ab Owain Glynd≈µr was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London, while Owain‚Äôs brother Tudur was slain in the field. The close family resemblance in Tudur's face briefly convinced some English that Owain himself had fallen. Another serious blow was the death of John ap Hywel, Abbot of the Llantarnam Cistercian monastery, a notable supporter of Glynd≈µr who was killed during the battle as he ministered to the dying and wounded of both sides. Rhys Gethin may also have died here if he did not die in the earlier Battle of Grosmont. Assessment Adam of Usk states concerning the battle that: ‚ÄúAnd from that time forth in those parts the fortunes of Owen waned.‚Äù Welsh Annals state that: ‚ÄúAt this time Glamorgan made its submission to the English, except a few who went to Gwynedd to their master.\\" It seems the battle saw more or less the end of the strength of the rebellion in south east Wales. One history of the rebellion says of the battle that the defeat ‚Äúsuggest that the rashness of local initiatives was endangering the revolt as a whole.‚ÄùThe Revolt of Owain Glyn Dwr by R. R. Davies (2001), 233 It certainly indicates the dangers of Owain‚Äôs guerrilla warfare tactics when the enemy were prepared. Defeat in the battle and the loss of many good men was to undermine the possibilities offered by the French troops that arrived later that year to support Glyndwr. It is significant that just a few months later in late summer, Owain when facing King Henry IV himself on Abberley Hill in Worcestershire felt reluctant to initiate an attack, the two opposing armies facing each other for eight days. It is interesting to conjecture that with victory behind him at Usk and his brother still alive and south east Wales secure how Owain might have conducted himself at Abberley Hill - the battle that never was. In 2005, the 600th anniversary of the battle of Pwll Melyn was commemorated by a son-et-lumiere show. In 2007 A plaque commemorating the battle was placed near the spot where it took place.

Biography  Prescott's parents were part of the Millerite movement. W. W. Prescott graduated from Dartmouth College in 1877 and served as principal of high schools in Vermont, and published and edited newspapers in Maine and Vermont prior to accepting the presidency of Battle Creek College (1885 to 1894). While still president of Battle Creek College he helped found Union College and became its first president in 1891. In 1892 he assumed the presidency of the newly founded Walla Walla College in Washington. Five years later, he helped found Australasian Mission College (now Avondale College) in Australia. He was invited to tour many regions of the world (1894-1895) to hold Bible institutes and to strengthen developing educational interests. Back in the USA in 1901, he became vice-president of the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist church, chairman of the Review and Herald Publishing Association board (a Seventh-day Adventist church operated publishing house), and editor of the Review and Herald (a Seventh-day Adventist church religious magazine). On relinquishing this editorship in 1909, he edited the Protestant Magazine for seven years. He was a field secretary of the General Conference from 1915 until his retirement in 1937, serving during this time as principal of the Australasian Missionary College (1922), and as head of the Bible department at Union College (1924-1928). He spent the year 1930 visiting the churches and institutions in Europe.

A qanb≈´s or gambus () is a short-necked lute that originated in Yemen and spread throughout the Arabian peninsula. Sachs considered that it derived its name from the Turkic komuz, but it is more comparable to the oud.The gambus (lutes) of the Malay world: its origins and significance in zapin Music, Larry Hilarian, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 06 Jul 2004 The instrument was related to or a descendant of the barbat. It has twelve nylon strings that are plucked with a plastic plectrum to generate sound, much like a guitar. However, unlike a guitar, the gambus has no frets. Its popularity declined during the early 20th century reign of Imam Yahya; by the beginning of the 21st century, the oud had replaced the qanb≈´s as the instrument of choice for Middle-Eastern lutenists. Yemen migration saw the instrument spread to different parts of the Indian Ocean. In Muslim Southeast Asia (especially Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei), called the gambus, it sparked a whole musical genre of its own. Today it is played in Johor, South Malaysia, in the traditional dance Zapin and other genres, such as the Malay ghazal and an ensemble known as kumpulan gambus (\\"gambus group\\"). Kumpulan gambus can also be found active in Sabah, especially in the Bongawan district of East Malaysian Borneo. In the Comoros it is known as gabusi, and in Zanzibar as gabbus. In Yemen and Oman The qanbus is a traditional instrument from Yemen carved from a single block of wood. It is also played in Oman, where it is called gabbus. The lower half of the top is covered in skin, and the upper half has a wooden soundboard, often with small soundholes. It has a floating bridge, a sickle-shaped pegbox and usually 7 nylon or gut strings in 4 courses, with the lowest course single. There also exist 3 course versions, with 6 or 5 strings, though these are less common. https://atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/middle_east.htm#yemenhttp://inthegapbetween.free.fr/pierre/webpage_HTML1/GAMBUS_PROJECT_page.htm In East Africa A Gabusi from the Comoros Islands.

In the Comoros islands, a related instrument called the Gambusi is played, which is built in the same way but often has a flat-shaped pegbox, rather than the sickle-shape, and sometimes has a differently shaped soundbox. Both usually have 4 courses of strings, which can be double or single. https://atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/africa.htm#easthttps://stringedinstrumentdatabase.aornis.com/j.htmhttp://inthegapbetween.free.fr/pierre/webpage_HTML1/GAMBUS_PROJECT_page.htm In Malaysia and Indonesia A boy playing a gambus.

These are built the same way, but can have either a skin top or a wooden soundboard. They can have 3, 4 or 5 courses of strings. In Malaysia, the word gambus can also refer to the oud, so to avoid confusion, various descriptors are used in the names. The dambus is a related instrument which always has a wooden soundboard and a carved deer on the end of the pegbox.

Both his parents fought in the January Uprising. Throughout his life, Studnicki was famous for his strongly pro-German stance, and in the Polish People's Republic all his books were banned from publication. He was the older brother of historian Wac≈Çaw Studnicki. He died on 10 January 1953 in London.  Before 1918  His political career started in late 19th century at the Kronenberg Trade School in Warsaw, in the Socialist organization Proletariat, for which Russian authorities sent him first to the Warsaw Citadel (7 December 1888), and then to Eastern Siberia, where he spent six years. After returning from exile in 1896, he became activist of the Polish Socialist Party, but left it, choosing the national movement, in which he was the main ideologist. However, unhappy about the pro-Russian program of the nationalists, deserted them and in 1904 wrote a book From Socialism to Nationalism, in which Studnicki explained reasons for change of his ideals. In 1901, after visiting Vienna and Heidelberg, he settled in Austrian Galicia. In 1903 Studnicki moved to Lw√≥w, where he founded the Lw√≥w Weekly news magazine. In 1910 he authored another publication Polish Case in which he presented the need for reconstruction of Poland, based on the support of Austria-Hungary and the German Empire. Also, at that time Studnicki proposed changing Austria- Hungary into the Austrian-Hungarian-Polish federation. He was strongly anti- Russian, emphasizing that Russian Empire occupied 80% of the territory of the 1772 Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (see: Partitions of Poland). In the mid-1910s, Studnicki became one of the most important pro-German politicians in Poland. On 10 May 1916 he met Hans Hartwig von Beseler, Governor General of Warsaw, to whom he presented a project of independent Poland, with eastern borders along the Dvina and Berezina rivers and western borders unchanged, leaving Pozna≈Ñ, Bydgoszcz and Upper Silesia in German possession. Later, he became a member of the Provisional Council of State, a German-sponsored government, existing in Warsaw in the years 1916‚Äì1918, see Kingdom of Poland (1916‚Äì18). Studnicki was so influential in Polish politics in the late 1910s, that Matthias Erzberger called him the \\"spiritual father of the Act of 5th November, 1916\\". Therefore, Studnicki can be regarded as one of \\"founding fathers\\" of the Second Polish Republic, together with Roman Dmowski and J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski.  Interbellum Poland  In the Second Polish Republic Studnicki devoted his time to writing. He authored a number of books, among them Political System of Europe and Poland (1935), A Question of Czechoslovakia and Polish Raison d‚ÄôEtat (1938) and, finally Facing the Oncoming Second World War (1939) in which he correctly assessed and anticipated the events of the conflict. In Political System of Europe and Poland (System polityczny Europy a Polska), Studnicki wrote: \\"Poland and Germany can become the foundation of a large Central European bloc, together with Austria, Hungary, Czech, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece and the Baltic states: altogether, 200 million people\\". In his view, this bloc would oppose the Soviet Union. Studnicki correctly predicted the Anschluss and the collapse of Czechoslovakia, but in his opinion, stated in 1939, the annexation of Zaolzie into Poland was an inadequate reward for not allowing the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to pass through Polish territory. Apart from writing, Studnicki worked as a civil servant. He was established and managed the Statistical Office of the Civil Administration of the Eastern Lands (1919‚Äì1920).Jan Berger, Rys historyczny powstania G≈Ç√≥wnego Urzƒôdu Statystycznego, Wiadomo≈õci Statystyczne, 2008, no. 1, pp. 2-17 Later he was consultant at Ministry of Industry and Trade (1922‚Äì1926) and at Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1928‚Äì1930). Furthermore, he lectured at the Institute of Trade and Economical Sciences in Wilno. In 1935 and 1938 he tried to be elected to the Sejm, but failed to convince Polish voters. In a manner similar to National Democracy politicians, Studnicki espoused the view that Jews were \\"parasites on the healthy Branch of the Polish tree\\".Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present, University of Nebraska Press, Joanna Michlic, page 80 His work Sprawa polsko-zydowska was filled with anti-Semitic idioms, and advocated for the emigration of 100,000 Jewish Poles per annum with the goal of \\"dejudaization of Poland\\" in thirty years.Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present, University of Nebraska Press, Joanna Michlic, page 106-107  1939  In March 1939 Studnicki wrote in S≈Çowo that German occupation of Czechoslovakia was a mistake, as it provoked anti-German feelings among Poles, and worsened geostrategic situation of Poland. Nevertheless, he continued to support Polish-German alliance. On 6 April, a Polish-British communiqu√© was announced (see Anglo-Polish military alliance), regarding mutual guarantees. Studnicki knew well that a Polish - German conflict was imminent, trying to do everything he could to prevent it. On 13 April 1939, he wrote a letter to Minister J√≥zef Beck, warning that acceptance of British guarantees meant catastrophe for Poland. In his opinion, Poland should remain neutral in the oncoming war. He correctly predicted that the victory of Western Allies would draw Poland into Soviet sphere of influence, loss of her independence and eastern territories. According to him, Polish government should end all kinds of anti-German activities and try to peacefully settle all mutual problems. Studnicki proposed that Free City of Danzig should be handed over to the Third Reich, in exchange he expected the lease of the port of Liepaja in Latvia and German agreement of a Polish protectorate of independent Slovakia. On 5 May 1939, Studnicki wrote \\"Memo Against the War with Germany\\", sending it to all members of Polish government, except for Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski. He warned that acceptance of British guarantees increased the risk of armed conflict and as a result of this step, Poland would be first victim of German attack: \\"When one faces an enemy on two fronts, the weaker enemy is liquidated first. And we are the weaker enemy in this case (...) Poland should pledge neutrality, renounce the alliance with Britain and move its army eastwards, to protect the Soviet border\\". Studnicki claimed that Poland should promote the notion of \\"armed neutrality\\", as her priority should be not to allow the Red Army enter Polish territory. Nevertheless, the declaration of neutrality would end the Central European bloc, and was only a desperate attempt to postpone the conflict and preserve Poland's independence. In June 1939, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Studnicki published his last book of the interwar period, Facing the Oncoming Second World War. All copies of the book were immediately confiscated by the government censorship office, and Warsaw authorities planned to send the author to the Bereza Kartuska concentration camp. Studnicki precisely predicted the events of the oncoming conflict. He claimed that the Free City of Danzig in itself was not the sole reason of Polish-German disagreement. The conflict was about Polish role in the war, whether she would join German or Allied camp. British guarantees were aimed at drawing Poland to the Allied camp, but their acceptance meant that Germany would attack Poland first. To avoid this, Poland should hand Danzig over to Germany and allow for construction of an extraterritorial highway and rail line through the Polish Corridor. As for British guarantees, Studnicki claimed that during the 1920s and early 1930s, Great Britain never expressed any interest in Poland, so sudden change of mood in London was, in his opinion, insincere: \\"This alleged British concern over Polish interests along the Baltic Sea has a well-defined foundation. The British want German military power to attack Poland first, at the beginning of the war, when Britain is not yet ready for the conflict\\". In Studnicki's opinion, the Anglo-Polish alliance was very dangerous to Poland, as London wanted to draw the Soviet Union into the war as its ally. The Soviets would be rewarded with eastern Polish territories.  Second World War  During the war W≈Çadys≈Çaw Studnicki, whose pro-German stance was well known to German authorities, frequently intervened in support of arrested and executed Polish activists. Due to his efforts, Boles≈Çaw Piasecki, creator of National Radical Camp Falanga, was released from German prison. In most cases, however, Studnicki's interventions did not help. As a result, in January 1940 he decided to issue a \\"Memo to the German Government\\", in which he expressed his opposition to the policy of German occupational authorities, based on bloody terror. In his view, this stance would result in growing anti-German feelings among ethnic Poles, which would make it impossible to create an agreement between Poles and Germans, aimed at the Soviet Union. Furthermore, a few weeks after the Invasion of Poland, Studnicki presented to German military authorities the \\"Memo on Recreation of Polish Army and the Oncoming German - Soviet War\\". In this document, he proposed recreation of Polish Army, which would fight the Red Army alongside the Wehrmacht. Furthermore, he suggested that a Polish Government should be recreated. To make this happen, German authorities should cease killings and repression of Polish activists. Polish Army, in cooperation with the Wehrmacht, was to seize the territories west of the Dniepr river, while Germans were to march further east, to the Caucasus. Both memos were confiscated by Germans. Desperate, Studnicki decided then to personally visit Berlin, and talk to Adolf Hitler. In late January 1940, he went to Berlin, and talked with Joseph Goebbels, but without any fruits. After the conversation, he was interned at Babelsberg, but was released following a plea of Hermann G√∂ring. In August 1940 Studnicki returned to Warsaw. He remained in touch with German authorities, and his continuous pleas for better treatment of Poles resulted in his arrest on 10 July 1941. Studnicki remained in Pawiak Prison until August 1942, when he was released due to poor health and efforts of both Maurycy Stanis≈Çaw Potocki and the Hungarian ambassador. In the final years of the war, Studnicki criticized both German terror and Polish resistance, whose activities resulted in German reprisals and sufferings of civilian population. In his opinion, the Soviet Union was the main enemy of Poland, and all Polish forces should concentrate their efforts on fighting the Soviets. In July 1944 he left for Hungary, and then to Austria. In 1945 he went to Rome, and finally, in late 1946, Studnicki settled in London. Due to his uncompromising stance and unpopular convictions, he was isolated by other Polish immigrants. Furthermore, in 1948 he volunteered to defend Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein, but the court decided not to send for him. In 1951, the government of the Republic of Poland banned all his books.  After the war  Before his death, Studnicki published his Second World War memoirs. In Tragic Days he tried to explain and justify his pro-German stance. Originally, Studnicki's memoirs were titled How I did not become Polish Vidkun Quisling, but Mieczys≈Çaw Grydzewski, editor in chief of Polish News, which published the book, decided to change it. Several contemporary Polish historians, such as Jerzy ≈Åojek, Andrzej Piskozub, and Pawe≈Ç Wieczorkiewicz have stated that Studnicki was right back in the summer of 1939. They all claim that the only solution at that time was to sign an alliance with Germany, in order to avoid wartime destruction and communism. Another historian, Tomasz Gabis wrote in his book Imperial Games (2008) that if, in the summer of 1939. Poland had come to an agreement with Germany, the war would have never taken place, as France and the United Kingdom would have had no reason to declare it on Germany. Instead of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, a Central European anti-Soviet bloc would have been created. Another supporter of Studnicki's views is Piotr Zychowicz in his book Pact Ribbentrop - Beck.

Iani Chaos is a region of chaos terrain at the south end of the outflow channel Ares Vallis, of the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle (MC-19) region of the planet Mars, centered at approximately ~342¬∞E, 2¬∞S. This is the source region of Ares Vallis. The chaotic terrain is widely believed to have formed via the removal of subsurface water or ice, resulting in flooding at the surface, and the formation of Ares Vallis.

After being recruited nationally, he chose to play football at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. In his first two seasons with the Hurricanes, Costa was a backup quarterback, behind starter Gino Torretta. In his final two seasons, Costa was the starter for most of Miami's games, including a memorable win against rival Florida State on October 8, 1994. The 1994 Hurricanes reached the Bowl Coalition's championship game for that season, the 1995 Orange Bowl, where Costa passed for 248 yards (18-for-35) with two touchdowns and one interception, as Miami lost to Nebraska, 24‚Äì17. Costa finished his college career with a record of 19‚Äì3 as a starter; he appeared in a total of 34 games for the Hurricanes, passing for 4256 yards and 22 touchdowns. Costa was not selected in the 1995 NFL Draft. He had tryouts with the Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins, and Philadelphia Eagles, but did not make an NFL roster. Costa played two seasons with the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football, and then one season for the Mobile Admirals of the short-lived Regional Football League (RFL). Costa was the winning quarterback of the league's only championship game, played in June 1999. After the Regional Football League ceased operation, Costa moved back to the Philadelphia area and became a financial adviser.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 1 Business (US 1 Business) and MD 924 in Bel Air east to an entrance to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen. MD 22 is the main connection between the county seat of Bel Air and Aberdeen, which is the largest city in Harford County. The state highway also provides the primary route between Interstate 95 (I-95) and Aberdeen Proving Ground. MD 22 was one of the original state roads marked for improvement in 1909 and one of the original state-numbered highways in 1927. The highway was constructed between Bel Air and Aberdeen in the early 1910s. Another section of highway between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace, the Post Road, was also built in the early 1910s. The Post Road became part of US 40 in 1927 but was designated as an extension of MD 22 after US 40 was relocated in the early 1930s. MD 22 was reconstructed from Bel Air to Aberdeen in the 1950s. MD 22's present course east of I-95 was built in the late 1960s; the old section of MD 22 through Aberdeen became MD 132. Route description MD 22 eastbound past MD 155 in Churchville MD 22 begins in the Bel Air Courthouse Historic District in the town of Bel Air as a one-way pair, Fulford Avenue eastbound and Churchville Road westbound, at Main Street. Main Street carries northbound MD 924 and US 1 Business; the business route enters downtown Bel Air from the west on Fulford Avenue. Churchville Road continues west as unsigned MD 922E, which intersects Bond Street, which carries southbound MD 924 and US 1 Business; the business route leaves downtown Bel Air to the west on Churchville Road. The two directions of MD 22 unite at Shamrock Road as Churchville Road, a four-lane divided highway that passes Rockfield Park and The John Carroll School. The road heads north of Bynum Run Park, where a park and ride lot is located, as it leaves the town of Bel Air. The state highway crosses over Bynum Run as it passes through Fountain Green, where the highway intersects MD 543 (Fountain Green Road). East of MD 543, MD 22 reduces to a two-lane undivided road and passes the historic Dibb House and Tudor Hall, the latter notable for being the boyhood home of John Wilkes Booth. The state highway passes through the hamlet of Schucks Corner and intersects Thomas Run Road, which leads to Thomas Run Park, Harford Technical High School, Thomas Run Church, Medical Hall Historic District, and the historic Hays-Heighe House on the campus of Harford Community College. In the unincorporated village of Churchville, MD 22 intersects MD 136 (Calvary Road/Priestford Road) adjacent to the community's namesake, Churchville Presbyterian Church. After meeting the west end of MD 155 (Level Road) immediately to the east, the state highway curves to the south. After MD 156 (Aldino Road) splits to the east, MD 22 returns to an eastward heading to pass through the hamlet of Carsins. The state highway expands to a four-lane highway immediately before intersecting Long Drive, which serves as the entrance to Ripken Stadium, home of the Aberdeen IronBirds baseball team. A park and ride lot is located south of this intersection. Just east of the stadium complex, the state highway meets I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) at a six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange. View west from the east end of MD 22 at Aberdeen Proving Ground MD 22 continues east as Aberdeen Thruway, a four-lane divided highway bypass of downtown Aberdeen that connects I-95 with Aberdeen Proving Ground. Immediately east of I-95, the state highway enters the city limits of Aberdeen and intersects Beards Hill Road. Beards Hill Road heads south as unsigned MD 132A, which leads to MD 132 (Bel Air Avenue), the old alignment of MD 22 that leads to downtown Aberdeen. MD 22 continues east through an intersection with MD 462 (Paradise Road) and curves south. The state highway continues through grade-separated crossings of CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor northeast of downtown Aberdeen. Squeezed in between the two railroad lines is MD 22's partial cloverleaf interchange with US 40 (Philadelphia Boulevard); several movements between the two highways are provided via Rogers Avenue, which intersects MD 22 between the bridges across the Philadelphia Subdivision and US 40. East of the railroads, the highway intersects Post Road, which heads north as another section of MD 132 (officially MD 132B), before reaching its eastern terminus at Bel Air Avenue just west of an entrance to Aberdeen Proving Ground. This gate is open from 5:00 am to midnight and allows entry for persons with a Government ID; visitors must use the gate along MD 715. The highway continues onto the military base as Harford Boulevard. MD 22 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length. The highway is a part of the main National Highway System from I-95 to Aberdeen Proving Ground and as a principal arterial from MD 924 in Bel Air to I-95. History MD 22 was one of the original state roads marked for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The highway was part of the original main road from Baltimore to Aberdeen and Havre de Grace that passed through Bel Air. The Post Road, also known as the Philadelphia Road, did not become the main connection between Baltimore and Aberdeen until the 1920s. The highway from Bel Air to Churchville, part of the Bel Air Road extending west from Havre de Grace, was already improved beyond a rudimentary dirt road by 1910. The highway from Churchville to Paradise Road in Aberdeen was constructed in 1911. The portion of the state road between Bel Air and Churchville was reconstructed in 1913. The Post Road between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace was constructed as a state aid road around 1911. All three segments were constructed as a wide macadam road. The original construction did not include the portions of Bel Air Avenue and the Post Road within the limits of Aberdeen. The portion of Bel Air Avenue from Paradise Road to the Post Road and the Post Road from there to approximately the modern intersection of MD 22 and MD 132B were rebuilt as a wide concrete road in 1917. MD 22 eastbound past US 1 Business and MD 924 in Bel Air MD 22 was widened to with the addition of wide concrete shoulders around 1926, just before the highway became one of the original state-numbered highways in 1927. The Post Road became part of US 40 the same year. Both MD 22 and US 40 from Aberdeen to Havre de Grace were widened to by 1930. US 40 was relocated from the Post Road to its present alignment from Aberdeen to Havre de Grace between 1930 and 1933. MD 22 was extended north along the Post Road to MD 132B's present northern terminus by 1939. Work to further modernize MD 22 began in 1951 when Churchville Road from Bel Air to MD 156 near Churchville was straightened, widened, and resurfaced. The Bel Air-Churchville work was completed in 1953; the following year, the MD 22-MD 155 intersection was reconstructed. MD 22 from MD 156 to US 40 in Aberdeen was widened and resurfaced between 1954 and 1956. The Aberdeen Thruway was constructed to improve the east-west connection between I-95, US 40, and Aberdeen Proving Ground and to provide grade separated crossings of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX), Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak), and US 40. The grade separations had been contemplated as early as 1942. Construction on the relocation of MD 22 began in 1967 and was completed in 1969. The old alignment of MD 22 from I-95 east and north through Aberdeen to US 40 near Havre de Grace was designated MD 132. Beards Hill Road was reconstructed as a divided highway between MD 132 and MD 22 and the ramps from northbound I-95 to MD 132 and from eastbound MD 22 to MD 132 were constructed by 1972. The western end of MD 22 was changed to a one-way pair when Fulford Avenue was added to the state highway system as eastbound MD 22 in Bel Air in 1979. The state highway was expanded to a divided highway from the east end of the one-way pair to MD 543 between 1994 and 1999. MD 22 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from the I-95 overpass west to Long Drive in 2004 concurrent with the transformation of the original diamond interchange with I-95 to a partial cloverleaf with collector-distributor lanes.

These were the famous war elephants used by Carthage in the Punic Wars, their conflict with the Roman Republic. Although the subspecies has been formally described, it has not been widely recognized by taxonomists. Other names for this animal include the North African forest elephant, Carthaginian elephant, and Atlas elephant. Originally, its natural range probably extended across North Africa and down to the present Sudanese and Eritrean coasts. Description Roman bronze statue of a war elephant Carthaginian frescoestunisie : Tunisie, Carthage, la ville disparue and coins minted by whoever controlled North Africa at various times show very small elephants, perhaps at the shoulder, with the large ears and concave back typical of modern African elephants. The North African elephant was smaller than the modern African bush elephant (L. a. africana), probably similar in size to the modern African forest elephant (L. cyclotis). History After they conquered Sicily in 242 BC, the Romans wanted to capture some specimens that had been left behind in the middle of the island by the Carthaginians, but failed in the endeavor. The elephants with which Hannibal crossed the Pyrenees and the Alps in order to invade Italy during the Second Punic War (218‚Äì201 BC) belonged to this group, with the exception of Hannibal's personal animal, Surus (meaning \\"the Syrian,\\" or possibly \\"One-Tusker\\"). This individual, according to his documented name and large size, may have been a Syrian elephant (Elephas maximus asurus), which was possibly a subspecies of the extant Asian elephant that became extinct shortly after Hannibal invaded Italy, but before the extinction of the North African elephant. The North African elephant was also trained and used by the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. Writing in the 2nd century BC, Polybius (The Histories; 5.84) described their inferiority in battle against the larger Indian elephants used by the Seleucid kings. A surviving Ptolemaic inscription enumerates three types of war elephant, the \\"Troglodytic\\" (probably Libyan), the \\"Ethiopian\\", and the \\"Indian\\". The Ptolemaic king prides himself with being the first to tame the Ethiopian elephants, a stock which could be identical to one of the two extant African species. During the reign of Augustus, Roman circus games resulted in the killing of 3,500 elephants. Taxonomic uncertainty Given the relatively recent date of its disappearance, the status of this population can probably be resolved through ancient DNA sequence analyses, if specimens of definite North African origin can be located and examined. Roman Republic aged remains, from Tetouan, Morocco identified to Elephantidae by collagen fingerprinting likely belong to this taxon.

History  CRAMM was created in 1987 by the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), now renamed into Cabinet Office, of the United Kingdom government. Methodology CRAMM comprises three stages, each supported by objective questionnaires and guidelines. The first two stages identify and analyze the risks to the system. The third stage recommends how these risks should be managed. The three stages of CRAMM are as follows: Stage 1 The establishment of the objectives for security by: * Defining the boundary for the study for Risk Assessment * Identifying and valuing the physical assets that form part of the system; * Determining the 'value' of the data held by interviewing users about the potential business impacts that could arise from unavailability, destruction, disclosure or modification; * Identifying and valuing the software assets that form part of the system. Stage 2 The assessment of the risks to the proposed system and the requirements for security by: * Identifying and assessing the type and level of threats that may affect the system; * Assessing the extent of the system's vulnerabilities to the identified threats; * Combining threat and vulnerability assessments with asset values to calculate measures of risks. Stage 3 Identification and selection of countermeasures that are commensurate with the measures of risks calculated in Stage 2. CRAMM contains a very large countermeasure library consisting of over 3,000 detailed countermeasures organised into over seventy logical groupings.  Deployment  CRAMM is in use by NATO, the Dutch armed forces, and corporations working actively on security, like Unisys. CRAMM is offered in English and Dutch versions.

Fixed income securities In the fixed income markets, IDBs are specialized securities companies serving as intermediaries which facilitate transactions between broker/dealers and dealer banks in the debt markets.From the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association‚Äôs educational piece explaining the role of Interdealer Brokers. Broker/dealers and other financial institutions utilize the secondary fixed income markets to execute their customers‚Äô orders, trade for a profit and manage their exposure to risk, including credit, interest rate and exchange rate risks. There is no centralized exchange in the fixed income market. As a result, financial institutions need a way to find information, liquidity and anonymity for their trading activity. This need created a demand for the services of perhaps the least known and understood market participants, IDBs. IDBs in the secondary government, agencies, corporate and other debt markets, also known as ‚Äúmunicipal securities broker‚Äôs brokers‚Äù in the municipal bond markets, are specialized securities companies who act as intermediaries working to facilitate transactions between broker/dealers and dealer banks in these markets. IDBs are sometimes described as providing a ‚ÄúPetri dish‚Äù of liquidity in the bond markets. That is, they provide a ‚Äúnurturing environment‚Äù wherein market participants can ascertain information about a given market, thereby eventually facilitating a trade between buyers and sellers. The IDB community distributes information and facilitates transactions in the secondary, or wholesale, financial debt markets between dealers and dealer banks around the world. Typically, markets which make extensive use of IDBs include the corporate bond, fixed income derivatives, U.S. Government and Agency, municipal securities and emerging markets. Inter-dealer brokers play varying roles in each of the fixed income markets and have become instrumental to their effectiveness and efficiency. IDBs draw together buyers and sellers so that trades can be executed by market participants. IDBs provide potential buyers and sellers with the critical market information they need to trade. Inter-dealer brokers allow; * Enhancing price discovery and transparency via communicating dealer interests and transactions * Providing anonymity and confidentiality via their position in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of trades * Facilitating information flow via acting as a central information point * Facilitating enhanced liquidity via their broad range of contacts * Improving market efficiency via their rapid access to liquidity * Lowering costs via their provision of prices to traders without incurring staffing costs ReferencesExternal links * Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Chapter 3, Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Financial Markets Group Category:Fixed income ","title":"Inter-dealer broker"},{"id":"12784329","text":"The Manitoba Hockey League was a senior men's ice hockey league operating in or around the 1920s in Manitoba, Canada, under the auspices of the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association, now known as Hockey Manitoba.

Traditionally market researchers focused on various demographic, psychographic, and lifestyle schemes to categorize and describe homogeneous clusters of consumers that comprise possible target markets. With the advent of personal computers and home video in the late 1980s and the explosion in Internet use, personal digital assistants, BlackBerries, video games, cell phones, etc. in the 1990s, information and communication technologies have emerged as a central focus and defining force in a wide range of occupations and lifestyles. Accordingly, market researchers realized the need for a segmentation scheme based on the role that technology plays in consumers' lives. Development Technographic segmentation was developed to measure and categorize consumers based on their ownership, use patterns, and attitudes toward information, communication and entertainment technologies. The concept and technique was first introduced in 1985 by Dr. Edward ForrestUniversity of Alaska entry in a study of VCR users. It was elaborated upon in the article \\"Segmenting VCR Owners\\" published in the Journal of Advertising Research. The article suggested that the profiling of technology consumers \\"should be based on an amalgam of variables which might best be referred to as 'technographic'... which focuses on the motivations, usage patterns, attitudes about technology... as well as measures of a person's fundamental values and lifestyle perspective.\\" Journal of Advertising Research (Volume 28, No.2, April/May 1988:pg 38) The concept has been adopted by Forrester Research, Inc. as a research service for information-technology and marketing professionals, business strategists, and technology industry executives. Technographics has two categories, Social Technographics and Mobile Technographics. Technographic data can be mined from technical support forums, company social media postings, press releases, government/public websites, and even online job postings.

He entered the novitiate for a brief period under a different religious name though ill health forced him to leave but did not hinder him from still training and living alongside the Passionists. He re-entered the order after his ordination and went on to hold several positions of leadership within his own order; he was even likened to Saint Paul of the Cross while Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X held him in high esteem. His beatification was celebrated on 16 October 1988 in Saint Peter's Square and his liturgical feast is affixed to the date of his death as is the custom. Life=Education and priesthood Cesare Silvestrelli was born on 7 November 1831 in Rome as the third of seven children to the nobles Gian Tommaso Silvestrelli (d. 1853) and Teresa Gozzani (d. 1846) and were residents of the Piazza della Minerva since their residence was at no. 38; he was baptized just hours after his birth in the names Cesare Pietro at Santa Maria sopra Minerva. His brother was Luigi (d. 20 September 1867). His father's funeral saw the attendance of 120 Franciscans and 40 Capuchins as well as 40 Dominicans. He did his initial education first at the Jesuit-run Roman College (1840‚Äì47) and thereafter continued his studies at an institute at the Caravita Oratorio in addition to a series of private schools. He was attracted to the Passionist charism and entered their order on 21 February 1854 (at Santi Giovanni e Paolo) before being admitted into their novitiate at their San Giuseppe convent in Monte Argentario on 25 March 1854. He received the religious habit and was given the name \\"Luigi del Sacro Cuore di Maria\\" on 7 April 1854. But he was forced to leave the novitiate on 3 May due to ill health though continued living with the Passionists in another house in the same town while he did theological studies. He did those studies under Father Pacifico di San Giuseppe and from 31 June to 24 August 1855 lived at Santi Giovanni e Paolo. Silvestrelli received his ordination to the priesthood on 22 December 1855 (as a diocesan priest rather than one in the religious life) from Bishop Giuseppe-Maria Molajoni. He then decided to re-enter the order and so sent another application before being accepted. On 1 April 1856 he entered the novitiate once again though this time at Morrovalle where he re-assumed the habit and the new religious name \\"Bernardo Maria di Ges√π\\". It was here that he was the classmate of fellow novice Francesco Possenti. He made his final profession on 28 April 1857. Thereafter he pursued studies for preaching and once that was finished he was assigned first as the director of students at Morrovalle (1860-1864) and then as the Master of Novices at the Passionist convent of Scala Santa (adjacent to the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome) from January 1865 until 1869. Leadership His brother Luigi died on September 20, 1867 and he was present at his brother's bedside as he died; he attended the funeral on 23 September at Santa Maria sopra Minerva. He was then appointed as the rector of the Scala Santa convent and held that position from 27 May 1869 until 1875 after being confirmed on 14 April 1872. It was here that - on 19 September 1870 - Pope Pius IX visited the steps from which the convent assumed its name. The pope was making his last visit to the sacred sites of Rome before the dissolution of the Papal States. Silvestrilli supported the Pope through holding onto his arm as both men climbed the steps weeping together. On 7 June 1875 he was elected as the first Provincial Consulter of the Roman province (he moved to Vetralla around this stage for a brief period) and he later became the Vice-Provincial Superior in July 1876. In the General Chapter on 4 May 1878 he was elected as the Superior General of the order. and his first term ran until 1884. In this position he worked hard to reconcile rival factions in the order and also founded new houses abroad (more so in Latin America as well as advancing the Bulgarian mission) and reformed the regulations of the order; he was firm in the conviction that a return to the original spirit and the Rule of the founder could be the singular formula for reviving the spirit of the charism. In 1887 he accepted a request from Cardinal Francis Patrick Moran to send Passionists to Australia in 1887. He was re-elected as Superior General in 1884 and resigned from the position on 2 January 1889 after making his decision in 1888. In 1893 a vision of his former classmate Possenti convinced him to attend the General Chapter and he was then once more elected as the Superior General (on 3 May) which was a post to which he was re-elected again in 1899 (in the first vote) and on 8 May 1905 (in the first vote). He attended a retreat at Monte Argentario in August 1890 and dwelt in the smallest cell while spending long periods of time before the Eucharist in adoration. He established an international house of studies for Passionist students at Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Rome and visited all the Passionist provinces in the world including a visit to the United States of America in 1896. It was around this stage that he developed arthrosis of the spine that made leg and neck movement difficult for him. He resigned again on 7 July 1907 (for the final time) which Pope Pius X accepted but the pope named him as an \\"Onorario Generale\\" for life due to his great service while in office and also as a sign of the pope's esteem. He was often praised as a second Paul of the Cross and even Pope Leo XIII and Pius X regarded him high enough to offer him the cardinalate several times despite his humble refusals. Death On 16 June 1911 he retired to the Passionist convent in Moricone and died there on 9 December 1911 after he fell backwards down a set of stairs as he was ascending. His remains were later exhumed and moved to the Moricone convent on 17 April 1931. Beatification The beatification process opened under Pope Pius XII on 13 February 1942 and he became titled as a Servant of God while the confirmation of his model Christian life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Paul VI to name him as Venerable on 18 October 1973. Pope John Paul II later beatified Silvestrelli on 16 October 1998 in Saint Peter's Square. The current postulator for the cause is the Passionist priest Giovanni Zubiani.

He resigned in disgrace from the Minnesota House on November 30, 2017, following multiple accusations of sexual harassment. Early life, education, and career Cornish was educated at Garden City High School in Garden City Township, Minnesota and has received secondary education. From 1975 to 1977 he served as a police officer for the city of Amboy. From 1977 to 1980 he served as a deputy sheriff for Blue Earth County. In 1980 he became a conservation officer for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, serving 22 years before retiring in 2002. He was the police chief of Lake Crystal from 2007 to 2012. Minnesota House of Representatives Cornish was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2002 and was re-elected in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. Cornish had a history of treating staff and lobbyists very poorly during his tenure in the Minnesota House of Representatives. On November 27, 2017, Cornish submitted his letter of resignation, which became effective at 11:59 p.m. on November 30, 2017. In a letter, Cornish apologized to his fellow house members for \\"bringing a cloud over the House and my friends.\\" He also submitted a letter that included a \\"wish list\\" for his replacement that went on to argue against anti cop bills and the need for legislative action that would push cops to obtain their own lability insurance. Sexual harassment allegations In November 2017, state Rep. Erin Maye Quade and another woman, a lobbyist, accused Cornish of sexually harassing them. In response, Cornish said that his interaction with Maye Quade was taken out of context and meant as a friendly, joking exchange. He said the incidents in his office alleged by the lobbyist never happened, though he admitted that he did send her a string of text messages soliciting sex. House Speaker Kurt Daudt suspended Cornish as chairman of the Public Safety Committee following the allegations. Subsequently, former House Speaker Kurt Zellers said that during his time as speaker from 2011 to 2012 he had confronted Cornish about sexually harassing women at the State Capitol and called for him to resign. In interviews with MPR News, 25 people who worked with or around Cornish the past seven years described alleged unwanted sexual advances to unwanted flirtatious contact.

It served as a point to gather Belgian Jews and Romani ahead of their deportation to concentration and extermination camps in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust. The camp was established in March 1942 and was the only transit camp in Belgium. It was managed by the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo-SD), a branch of the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt, and was used to hold Jews and Romani ahead of their deportation to Auschwitz- Birkenau as well as other camps including Heydebreck-Cosel. Between 4 August 1942 and 31 July 1944, 28 trains left from near the camp and deported over 25,000 people. Only 1,240 survived the war. The camp was abandoned at the Liberation of Belgium in September 1944 and subsequently was repurposed for housing. A museum was established in 1996 and today part of the former barracks and a new building opposite form part of the Kazerne Dossin ‚Äì Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights, which includes a Holocaust memorial and museum. Background Map of the Holocaust: this map shows all concentration and extermination camps in German-occupied Europe as well as labor camps, prison camps, ghettos, major deportation routes and major massacre sites German occupation and persecution Belgium was invaded by Nazi Germany in a rapid military campaign on 10‚Äì28 May 1940. It was subsequently placed under a military occupation administration which would endure until July 1944 when the territory briefly passed under a civilian administration, brought to an end by the Liberation of Belgium in September 1944. As early as September 1940, the German administration established a prison camp (Auffanglager) in Fort Breendonk, a former Belgian military fort. Inmates were largely political prisoners, though a number of Jews were also held in a segregated part of the camp. As part of the Final Solution (Endl√∂sung) after January 1942, it was decided to transport Belgian Jews to concentration and extermination camps in Eastern Europe. Mechelen transit camp Approximately 90 percent of Belgium's Jewish population lived in the cities of Antwerp and Brussels in 1942. Accordingly, Mechelen, a city with a railway hub located halfway between the two, was chosen as the site of the new transit camp. The building chosen to house the camp was a former army facility called Dossin Barracks (Caserne Dossin), built in 1756 and named after Lieutenant-General √âmile Dossin de Saint-Georges, a hero of the Battle of the Yser during World War I. It was located in the north of the city and provided access to the railway freight dock serving the River Dyle. The three-storey block that completely surrounded a large square yard was fitted with barbed wire. It became operational in July 1942. Operation The camp staff was mostly German but was assisted by Belgian collaborationist paramilitaries from the Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen (\\"General SS Flanders\\"). It was officially under the command of Philipp Schmitt, commandant of the Fort Breendonk. The acting commandant at Mechelen was SS officer Rudolph Steckmann. The first group of people arrived in the camp from Antwerp on 27 July 1942. Between August and December 1942, two transports, each with about 1,000 Jews, left the camp every week for Auschwitz concentration camp. Between 4 August 1942 and 31 July 1944, a total of 28 trains left Mechelen for Poland, carrying 24,916 Jews and 351 Roma; most of them went to Auschwitz. This figure represented more than half of the Belgian Jews murdered during the Holocaust. In line with the Nazi racial policy that much later became named the Porajmos (or Samudaripen), 351 Belgian Roma were sent to Auschwitz in early 1944. Conditions at the Mechelen camp were especially brutal. Many Roma were locked in basement rooms for weeks or months at a time without food or sanitary facilities. The Roma had an especially low survival rate. Summer 1942: the Mechelen transit camp after the arrival of those caught during the night.

Some people succeeded in escaping the transports, especially from the Transports 16 and 17 which consisted of men returned from forced labor on the Atlantic Wall to Belgium. Most of these men jumped between Mechelen and the German border. Many were caught and were soon put on subsequent transports but a total of about 500 Jewish prisoners did manage to escape across all the 28 transports. On 19 April 1943 three resistance fighters, acting on their own initiative, stopped Transport 20 near the train station of Boortmeerbeek, south-east of Mechelen. From this action 17 prisoners managed to flee. More Jews escaped by their own deeds, a total of 231 Jews fled although 90 were eventually recaptured and 26 were shot by guards escorting the train. The last transport left on 31 July 1944 but Allied forces could not stop it before its destination was reached. When the Allies approached Mechelen by 3 September 1944, the Germans fled the Dossin Barracks, leaving the 527 remaining prisoners behind. Some remaining prisoners escaped that night and the others were freed on the 4th, though soon replaced with suspected collaborators. The lists of deportees were left at Hasselt during the German retreat and were later discovered intact. Memorial and Museum In 1948 Dossin Barracks reverted to its original use by the Belgian Army. It was used until 1975 when it was abandoned. Apart from a wing renovated in the 1980s for social housing, the barracks became the site of the Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance by 1996. In 2001, the Flemish Government decided to expand the institution by a new complex built opposite the old barracks; the latter closed in July 2011, to become a memorial monument.

Dr. No (or Doctor No) is a comic book by Norman J. Nodel. It is a loose adaptation of the eponymous James Bond film released in 1962, which in turn is inspired by the novel by Ian Fleming. It was first published in the United Kingdom in Classics Illustrated #158A. Description The 32-page comic follows the film script and most of the characters are drawn to resemble their screen counterparts. Some deviations are found, such as Dr. No being electrocuted instead of drowned. The original British cover depicted Dr. No, as well as the scene Bond and Honey Rider meet the tank disguised as a dragon. For the US publishing, the comic was censored, deleting all racial skin colour and dialogue thought to be demeaning. It also received a different cover, by Bob Brown, an inside front cover with photos from the film, and an inside back cover with brief biographies of Bond and Fleming. Publication history It was first published in the United Kingdom in Classics Illustrated #158A in December 1962, being later reprinted in Detective Stories by Dell Publishing through Europe. The United States publisher of Classics Illustrated, Gilberton, marketed their CI series as educational in nature and felt that releasing Dr. No would be a poor marketing fit. So the rights were sold to Independent News, then-owners of DC Comics, who published the comic as issue 43 of the Showcase anthology series, in January 1963. As the US issue hit the news stands four months before the film's US release, sales were disappointing. With interior art very different from most other work published by DC Comics, it may have had trouble finding an audience since James Bond was still relatively unknown in the US at the time. DC has not published another James Bond comic since, though they considered starting a title when their 10-year option for a Bond comic was about to expire in 1972. Artist Jack Kirby and writer Alex Toth were contacted, but DC ultimately decided against it, feeling unsure about the future of the characters as Sean Connery made what he stated would be his last appearance as 007, Diamonds Are Forever.

This approach to the problem was published by Joseph-√âmile Barbier in 1860. Buffon's needle Suppose there exist infinitely many equally spaced parallel lines, and we were to randomly toss a needle whose length is less than or equal to the distance between adjacent lines. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line upon landing? To solve this problem, let l be the length of the needle and D be the distance between two adjacent lines. Then, let \\\\theta be the acute angle the needle makes with the horizontal, and let x be the distance from the center of the needle to the nearest line. The needle lies across the nearest line if and only if x \\\\le \\\\frac{l \\\\cos \\\\theta}{2} . We see this condition from the right triangle formed by the needle, the nearest line, and the line of length x when the needle lies across the nearest line. Now, we assume that the values of x, \\\\theta are randomly determined when they land, where 0 < x < \\\\frac{D}{2} , since 0 < l < D , and 0 < \\\\theta < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} . The sample space for x, \\\\theta is thus a rectangle of side lengths \\\\frac{D}{2} and \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} . The probability of the event that the needle lies across the nearest line is the fraction of the sample space that intersects with x \\\\le \\\\frac{l}{2} \\\\cos \\\\theta . Since 0 < l < D , the area of this intersection is given by \\\\text{Area (event)} = \\\\int^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}}_{0} \\\\frac{l}{2} \\\\cos \\\\theta d \\\\theta = \\\\frac{l}{2} \\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} - \\\\frac{l}{2} \\\\sin 0 = \\\\frac{l}{2} . Now, the area of the sample space is \\\\text{Area (sample space)} = \\\\frac{D}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} = \\\\frac{D \\\\pi}{4} . Hence, the probability P of the event is P = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Area (event)}}{\\\\text{Area (sample space)}} = \\\\frac{l}{2} \\\\frac{4}{D \\\\pi} = \\\\frac{2 l}{\\\\pi D} . Bending the needle The interesting thing about the formula is that it stays the same even when you bend the needle in any way you want (subject to the constraint that it must lie in a plane), making it a \\"noodle\\"‚Äîa rigid plane curve. We drop the assumption that the length of the noodle is no more than the distance between the parallel lines. The probability distribution of the number of crossings depends on the shape of the noodle, but the expected number of crossings does not; it depends only on the length L of the noodle and the distance D between the parallel lines (observe that a curved noodle may cross a single line multiple times). This fact may be proved as follows (see Klain and Rota). First suppose the noodle is piecewise linear, i.e. consists of n straight pieces. Let Xi be the number of times the ith piece crosses one of the parallel lines. These random variables are not independent, but the expectations are still additive due to the linearity of expectation: : E(X_1+\\\\cdots+X_n) = E(X_1)+\\\\cdots+E(X_n). Regarding a curved noodle as the limit of a sequence of piecewise linear noodles, we conclude that the expected number of crossings per toss is proportional to the length; it is some constant times the length L. Then the problem is to find the constant. In case the noodle is a circle of diameter equal to the distance D between the parallel lines, then L = œÄD and the number of crossings is exactly 2, with probability 1. So when L = œÄD then the expected number of crossings is 2. Therefore, the expected number of crossings must be 2L/(œÄD). There is one more surprising consequence. In case the noodle is any closed curve of constant width D the number of crossings is also exactly 2. This implies Barbier's theorem asserting that the perimeter is the same as that of a circle.

Robert Greene was a popular Elizabethan dramatist and pamphleteer known for his negative critiques of his colleagues. He is said to have been born in Norwich. He attended Cambridge, receiving a BA in 1580, and an M.A. in 1583 before moving to London, where he arguably became the first professional author in England. Greene was prolific and published in many genres including romances, plays and autobiography. Family According to Richardson, the \\"chief problem\\" in compiling a biography of Robert Greene was his name. \\"Robert\\" was one of the most popular given names of the era and Greene was a common surname. Newcomb suggests that Robert Greene \\"was probably the Robert Greene, son of Robert Greene, baptized on 11 July 1558 at St George's, Tombland, Norwich.\\" > Greene later described himself as from Norwich on his title-pages, and the > year is appropriate for the Robert Greene who matriculated at St John's > College, Cambridge, as a sizar on 26 November 1575. The author's father was > probably one of two Robert Greenes found later in parish records: either a > saddler who lived modestly in the parish until 1599, or a cordwainer who > kept an inn in Norwich from the late 1570s until his death in 1591. The > saddler appeals to biographers who attribute the writer's later low-life > sympathies to a humble birth; the innkeeper, a more prosperous man possibly > related to landowners, interests scholars who note the social ambitions of > Greene's early works. Both the Norwich cordwainer-turned-innkeeper and the Norwich saddler left wills, proved in 1591 and 1596 respectively, but neither will mentioned a son named Robert. However, Greene himself implied that he had been disinherited by his father. Career Greene is thought to have attended the Norwich Grammar School, although this cannot be confirmed as enrolment documents for the relevant years are lost. Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, provided scholarships for students from the Norwich grammar school, and for this reason Greene's matriculation as a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, has been considered \\"strange\\". A reason offered for Greene's enrolment at St John's is that some of the gentry of South Yorkshire attended St John's, and among the dedicatees of, or authors of commendatory verses for Greene's books were members of the Darcy, Portington, Lee, Stapleton, and Rogers families, all centred at Snaith, Yorkshire; according to Richardson, the Robert Greene from Norwich who was an innkeeper may have been an immigrant from Yorkshire connected to 'a large family of Greenes' who lived in the parish of Snaith, and may actually have left Norwich to reside at Snaith from 1571 to 1577. There is no record of Greene's having taken part in the dramatic productions at Cambridge in 1579 and 1580, although 18 of his classmates and Fellows of the Cambridge colleges acted in Hymenaeus, and 46 in Richardus Tertius. His academic performance as an undergraduate at Cambridge was mediocre; on 22 January 1580 he took his BA, graduating 38th out of 41 students in his college, and 115th out of the total university graduating class that year of 205 students. He \\"apparently transferred to Clare College for his 1583 MA\\", where he placed 5th out of 12 students in his college, and 29th of the 129 students at the university. It was \\"rare for a student to migrate to another college (as Greene did) after he had received the baccalaureate\\", and no record of Greene's transfer to Clare College has been discovered, nor does his name appear in the Clare Hall Buttery Book for 1580‚Äì84. Greene's claim to association with Clare College is found in the second part of Mamillia, which was not published until 1593, after Greene's death, in which the dedicatory epistle to Robert Lee and Roger Portington is signed \\"Robert Greene. From my Studie in Clarehall the vii. Of Julie\\".Newcomb states that 7 July was \\"the very date in 1583 on which Greene graduated MA from Clare College\\"; however according to Parr, Pruvost \\"mistakenly contends that the M.A. was always awarded in July\\", and there is no record of the time of year at which M.A. degrees were awarded in 1583, although \\"those of 1577‚Äì80 were awarded in March and April\\" (p. 540). Title page of Greene's Farewell to Folly, 1591 According to Newcomb, \\"Other events of [Greene's] youth must be derived from autobiographical remarks that may not be reliable\\". In The Repentance of Robert Greene, written in the first person, Greene claimed to have travelled to Italy and Spain; however, no evidence of Greene's continental trip has been found, \\"or‚Äîunless we take merely his word for it‚Äîthat he ever made the trip at all\\". Further doubt is cast on Greene's continental journey by Norbert Bolz, who after undertaking a computer analysis of the vocabulary of The Repentance, concluded that \\"The Repentance of Robert Greene was in fact not written by Robert Greene\\". In The Repentance, Greene claimed to have married a gentleman's daughter, whom he abandoned after having had a child by her and spent her dowry, after which she went to Lincolnshire, and he to London. In Four Letters (1592), Gabriel Harvey prints a letter allegedly written by Greene to his wife in which he addresses her as \\"Doll\\". However, \\"[E]xtensive searches of London and Norwich records by successive biographers have failed finally to locate the record of Greene's marriage\\". After his move to London, Greene published over twenty-five works in prose in a variety of genres, becoming \\"England's first celebrity author\\". In 1588, he was granted an MA from Oxford University, \\"almost certainly a courtesy degree\\". Thereafter the title pages of some of his published works bore the phrase Utruisq. Academiae in Artibus Magister', \\"Master of Arts in both Universities\\". Greene died 3 September 1592,Dyce appears to be the first to give the specific date of Greene's death, but cites no source. (aged 34 if he was the Robert Greene baptised in 1558). His death and burial were announced by Gabriel Harvey in a letter to Christopher Bird of Saffron Walden dated 5 September, first published as a \\"butterfly pamphlet\\" about 8 September, and later expanded as Four Letters and Certain Sonnets, entered in the Stationers' Register on 4 December 1592. Harvey attributed Greene's demise to \\"a surfeit of pickle herring and Rhenish wine\\", and claimed he had been buried in \\"the new churchyard near Bedlam\\" on 4 September. No record of Greene's burial has been found. According to The Repentance of Robert Greene, Greene is alleged to have written Groatsworth during the month prior to his death, including in it a letter to his wife asking her to forgive him and stating that he was sending their son to her. No record of Greene's son by his wife has been found; however, in Four Letters, Gabriel Harvey claimed that Greene kept a mistress, Em, the sister of a criminal known as \\"Cutting Ball\\" hanged at Tyburn. Harvey described her as \\"a sorry ragged quean of whom [Greene] had his base son Infortunatus Greene\\". According to Newcomb, a Fortunatus Greene was buried at Shoreditch on 12 August 1593, \\"whose folk-tale name might lie behind Harvey's jest\\". Writing Title page of Greene's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay (1594 edition) According to Newcomb, '[Greene's] works evince an inexhaustible linguistic facility, grounded in wide (if not painstaking) reading in the classics, and extra-curricular reading in the modern continental languages'. He wrote prolifically: From 1583 to 1592, he published more than twenty-five works in prose, becoming one of the first authors in England to support himself with his pen in an age when professional authorship was virtually unknown. Greene's literary career began with the publication of a long romance, Mamillia, entered in the Stationers' Register on 3 October 1580. Greene's romances were written in a highly wrought style which reached its highest level in Pandosto (1588) and Menaphon (1589). Short poems and songs incorporated in some of the romances attest to his ability as a lyric poet. One song from Menaphon, Weep not my wanton, smile upon my knee, (a mother's lullaby to her baby son), enjoyed immense success, and is now probably his best-known work.The Oxford Companion to English Literature 7th Edition Dinah Birch ed. (2009) p.634 In his later \\"coney-catching\\" pamphlets, Greene fashioned himself into a well-known public figure, telling colourful inside stories of rakes and rascals duping young gentlemen and solid citizens out of their hard-earned money. These stories, told from the perspective of a repentant former rascal, have been considered autobiographical, and have been thought to incorporate many facts of Greene's own life thinly veiled as fiction: his early riotous living, his marriage and desertion of his wife and child for the sister of a notorious character of the London underworld, his dealings with players, and his success in the production of plays for them. However, according to Newcomb, in his later prose works \\"Greene himself built his persona around a myth of prodigal decline that cannot be taken at face value\\". His plays earned himself the title as one of the \\"University Wits\\", including George Peele, Thomas Nashe, and Christopher Marlowe. Richardson makes a similar argument, concluding that Greene's later works 'prejudice the examination of all the work before them', and that the prose works prior to the coney-catching and repentance pamphlets establish that 'initially at least Greene was respectable'. Richardson considers that Greene: > claimed from the outset a moral or civilizing purpose in his writing. His > tales repeatedly illustrate the disastrous disruptions caused in life by > passion and laud the life of restraint. His views are basically conservative > ... He equivocates and hesitates over the defence of the values of a > conservative culture, virginity, true devotion, strict moral probity. In addition to his prose works, Greene also wrote several plays, none of them published in his lifetime, including The Scottish History of James IV, Alphonsus, and his greatest popular success, Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay, as well as Orlando Furioso, based on Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso. In addition to the plays published under his name after his death, Greene has been proposed as the author of several other dramas, including a second part to Friar Bacon which may survive as John of Bordeaux, The Troublesome Reign of King John, George a Greene, Fair Em, A Knack to Know a Knave, Locrine, Selimus, and Edward III, and even Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus and Henry VI plays.Logan and Smith, pp. 81‚Äì85. Greene and Shakespeare Greene's Groats- worth Greene is most familiar to Shakespeare scholars for his pamphlet Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit, which alludes to a line, \\"O tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\\", found in Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3 ( 1591‚Äì92): Greene evidently complains of an actor who believes he can write as well as university-educated playwrights, alludes to the actor with a quotation that appears in both the True Tragedy quarto and Shakespeare's Folio version of Henry VI, Part 3, and uses the term \\"Shake-scene\\", a unique term never used before or after Greene's screed, to refer to the actor. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that it is \\"Of uncertain or vague meaning: used by Greene in his attack on Shakespeare.\\" Some scholars have hypothesized that all or part of Groatsworth was written shortly after Greene's death by Henry Chettle or another one of his fellow writers, hoping to capitalise on a lurid tale of death-bed repentance. Hanspeter Born argues that Greene wrote the whole of Groatsworth, and that his deathbed attack on the \\"upstart Crow\\" was provoked by Shakespeare's interference with a play attributed to Greene, A Knack to Know a Knave.Born, Hanspeter, \\"Why Greene was Angry at Shakespeare\\", Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England 25 (2012), 133‚Äì173. Greene's colourful and irresponsible character has led some, including Stephen Greenblatt, to speculate that Greene may have served as the model for Shakespeare's Falstaff. His quotation has also been used as the title for the 2016 sitcom Upstart Crow on Shakespeare's life, written by Ben Elton, its story commencing in 1592 (the year the quotation was written) and featuring Greene as a character (played by Mark Heap).

The Panotti (also Phanesii, Panotii and Panotioi, from the Greek words œÄ·æ∂ŒΩ and Œø·ΩñœÇ for \\"all ears\\") were a mythical race of people, described as possessing large ears that covered their entire bodies. Pliny the Elder In AD 77‚Äì79, the classical writer Pliny the Elder published his thirty-seven volumes of encyclopedic works known as the Natural History containing entries of both the real and the imaginative. In the Natural History, Pliny writes about the strange race of people known as the Panotti who live in the \\"All-Ears Islands\\" off of Scythia. These people there have bizarrely large ears that are so huge that the Panotti use them as blankets to shield their body against the chills of the night. Their ears were used in lieu of clothing.

Plot  Three years after the events of Romanitas, the Roman Empire is on the brink of war with Nionia (Japan), and plagued by a sequence of mysterious wildfires. Marcus Novius, the young heir to the Roman throne is forced to take charge as Regent when the Emperor Faustus falls suddenly ill. Marcus attempts to recruit Varius as his advisor, but Varius, who is still haunted by the events of the first book (in which he lost his wife and was framed for murder and treason), refuses. While Marcus works to avoid a world war, his lover Una is intent on discovering the truth about his ambitious cousin Drusus's involvement in a conspiracy that almost claimed Marcus's life. Her brother Sulien finds himself caught up along with Varius in a disastrous attack on an arms factory at Veii, just outside Rome. After surviving this and saving Sulien's life, Varius decides to return to political life after all, but Sulien is left with many questions about what happened. Una exposes Drusus's involvement in the murders of Marcus's parents and Varius's wife, although not before he almost kills her. Varius urges Marcus to have Drusus killed but Marcus is reluctant to begin his reign with an extra- judiciary killing, and is content to have Drusus tried for Una's attempted murder as there is no direct evidence for his other crimes. Drusus, however, has formed an alliance with a Roman general, Salvius, who releases Drusus from prison and urges the sickly Emperor Faustus to rethink his decision to allow Marcus so much power. Drusus, who has hitherto never felt much personal resentment of those who have stood in his way, has conceived a passionate hatred of Una, and tries to convince Faustus that she, Sulien, and Varius are a dangerous influence on Marcus. Sulien's attempts to discover more about the explosion at Veii lead him to believe he was somehow targeted. Una accompanies Marcus to peace talks hosted by the Sinoan (Chinese) Empress in the Song capital of Bianjing (Kaifeng). Things go well at first although Una discovers the Nionians are developing a super-weapon. But someone seems intent on sabotaging the negotiations. One of the Nionian party is killed by a Roman assassin and Marcus is abruptly summoned home by Faustus, under effective arrest. This leaves the Nionian Prince Tadahito deeply suspicious about Rome's intentions. Before he is forced to leave, Marcus hands over Una and Varius as hostages to the Nionians, partly as a sign of good faith, but primarily in the hope of keeping them away from Drusus, who would almost certainly have them tortured or killed. From within Nionian custody, and with the help of the Sinoan Empress and the Nionian Princess, Una and Varius attempt to influence the global action to stop Drusus causing a war, but their efforts come at a personal cost, especially for Una.

Born to an anti-colonialist family in Hyderabad, Abid Hasan was brought-up in India and later went to Germany to train as an engineer. While he was a student in Germany during World War II that Abid Hasan met Subhas Chandra Bose and decided to join the Indische Legion. Hasan would later serve as Bose's personal secretary and interpreter while Bose was in Germany. Hasan also sailed with Bose in the German U-Boat U-180 in 1943 on Bose's voyage to South East Asia. Over the course of the reformation of the INA and its campaigns in the south east Asian theatre, Hasan rose to be a Major in the Azad Hind Fauj. It was also during this that he adopted \\"Safrani\\", after the holy Hindu colour of Saffron, to his name as a mark of communal harmony. After repatriation to India at the end of the war, Abid Hasan was released following the end of the INA trials in 1946 and joined the Indian National Congress briefly. After partition, Hasan chose to settle in Hyderabad and joined the nascent Indian Foreign Service. Over a long diplomatic career, Hasan served as the Indian Ambassador to a number of countries including Egypt and Denmark before retiring in 1969 and settling back in Hyderabad. Abid Hasan Saffrani died in 1984. On suggestion of Abid Hasan, the INA adopted \\"Jai Hind\\" as its slogan; the term had been coined earlier by Chempakaraman Pillai. In the 1940s, the INA leaders decided to devise a religion-agnostic greeting for its soldiers: Thakur Yashwant Singh suggested \\"Hindustan ki Jai\\", but Hasan felt this was too long and suggested \\"Jai Hind\\" as an alternative, which was unanimously accepted. The term emerged as a national slogan after India's independence. Netaji Bose's nephew Aurobindo Bose later married Safrani's niece. Her name is Suraya Hasan. She was the daughter of elder brother of Abid Hasan safrini by name Badrul Hasan, who worked with Gandhiji. Mr Abid Hasan died on 05-04-1984. Scholarly activities Hasan was also a scholar who spent long hours with his Persian and Urdu poetry.

Very little was known about this weapon and very few examples have been imported into the west, with importer Century International Arms having imported around 600 at the turn of the century.https://www.forgottenweapons.com/ssg-82-the-enigmatic- east-german-sniper-rifle/ It's known that at least 2000 SSG 82s were made. The SSG 82 actually has been specifically designed for use in the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) to stop the import of police sniper rifles from non- socialist countries and military sniper rifles from socialist countries. History The development of the SSG 82 was done under the watch of Erich Mielke.https://www.dnn.de/Dresden/Lokales/Forscher-praesentiert-in-Dresden- die-Wunderwaffe-der-Stasi When Stasi HQ was occupied by activists, 10 SSG 82s were found and subsequently passed off to West Germany before they were passed on to gun collectors.https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/vermischtes/article157172890/Eine- Waffe-nur-fuer-die-Stasi.html  Design details  Kleinkaliber-Standardgewehr 150 (Small bore Standard rifle 150) The Scharfsch√ºtzengewehr 82 was technically based on the Suhler Kleinkalibergewehr Modell 150 Standard .22 Long Rifle (5.6 mm) caliber small bore competition rifle. This makes the SSG 82 design reminiscent of a European-style small bore competition rifle. There were plans to have the SSG 82 include a suppressor and a night vision scope, but they were called off.  Barreled action  The heart of the SSG 82 is a cold-hammer forged receiver and free-floating barrel with a semi-bull profile and features a target crown. The bolt has four locking lugs and requires a 60-degree bolt rotation to cycle the gun. The safety consist of a sliding safety actuated by rotating a small disk positioned at the right side just above the trigger. The two-stage trigger mechanism displays an adjustable trigger pull of . The detachable 5-round box magazine is based upon center feeding for maximum reliability as well as precise positioning of the cartridge into the chamber. The magazine release is located on the bottom right behind the magazine well.  Stock  The SSG 82 wooden stock resembles that of the Small bore Standard rifle 150 with a raised comb and a stippled pistol grip and forearm. The butt plate is adjustable for length of pull by adding or removing spacers and height.  Sights  The rifle has no iron sights but is equipped with a 4√ó32 telescopic sight (\\"Ziel4/S\\" 4√ó32 scope, reticle 1) with mounting rails made by VEB Zeiss Jena (in the original Zeiss plant that was captured by the Soviets at the end of WWII) which is numbered to the rifle and mounted using a quick detachable Suhler claw mountbase. This was a basic model of the VEB Zeiss Jena telescopic sight line as 6√ó36, 6√ó42M, 8√ó56M and variable 1.5‚Äì6√ó39, 1.5‚Äì6√ó42M and 3‚Äì12√ó56M magnification variants were also available. The Zeiss Jena non-M telescopic sight models had elevation correction and focusing turrets and were due to the lack of a windage correction turret corrected for windage by a gunsmith during mounting, hence these sights were dedicated to a particular rifle.  Precision  Internet sources report differing information regarding the attainable accuracy of fire, though the quality of the ammunition used is often mentioned as a very important factor in obtaining good accuracy. Reports on the accuracy of the rifle range from one hole 5-shot groups to 3-shot groups and anywhere in between. Users * ‚Äì The SSG 82 was used by the Department XXII of the Ministry of State Security, the Stasi \\"anti-terrorist service unit\\". Furthermore, bodyguards and forces of the Ministry of the Interior (MDI) as well as special forces of riot police were armed with this weapon. These service units possessed a high operational-tactical level of training and were intended for the prevention or combating of terrorist attacks, hostage-taking and terrorist attacks on the territory of East Germany. * Zgharta Liberation Army (ZLA) ‚Äì An unknown number of SSG 82 rifles were reportedly used by the Lebanese Christian ZLA militia during the Lebanese Civil War in the 1980s.

Elderly people in Laraos still speak an archaic Quechua dialect. As no more children speak the language, it is in imminent danger of extinction.  History  The Laraos District is one of oldest of the Yauyos Province, and its history is ample and emerges from the pre-incan times. Its preceding town is Sinchimarka, cradle of forgers, but simultaneously brave and militant men, like all the tribes who conformed the Yauyos, who were tenacious resistants before being conquered by the incan leader Pachakutiq. The pre- incan towns of Laraos are: Wanllapata, Waqramarka, Wayawmarka and Callawarqui. Sinchimarka is an incan citadel. In 1586, being viceroy Don Fernando de Torres of Portugal, the first mayor of Yauyos, Don Diego D√°vila Brice√±o, made the territorial demarcation and formed four parishes or curatos with more than four towns each one, entrusted at the service of the Dominican priests. These were: Santo Domingo de Yauyos, Santo Domingo de Laraos, San Crist√≥bal de Hu√°nec and Santa Maria de Pampas. It is to say that with the Spanish conquest, the natives of Sinchimarka were forced to become transferred to the present location of the district. Thus this one acquires the denomination of Santo Domingo de Cocha Laraos, being one of the most important towns and then they contributed in the process of cristanization of the inhabitants of Yauyos.  Etymology  Its name comes from a derivative of the word Jaqi or Jaqaru Larawpukyu (laraw paved street, pukyu spring, \\"spring in the paved street\\", hispanicized Laraupugio). With the Andean transculturization it is transformed into Laraus (plural), so it means paved streets, and with the castellanization it is pronounced Laraos.  Political division  The farming community of Laraos was recognized the 2 of September 1938. Their annexes are San Juan de Langaico and Lanca. Its populated centers are Llapay and Tintin. The town is divided into ten main streets: Callhuapampa, Ansaya, Larpa, Callampa, S√∫niqui, Cancayllu, Achallanca, Warca√±a, Caracara and Chunchillo.

Pilot ( (Paƒ≠lot) was a Russian icebreaker, the world's first steam-powered and metal-ship icebreaker of modern type. Pilot had originally been built as a steam-powered propeller tug. It had the bow altered to achieve an ice-clearing capability (20¬∞ raise from keel line). Conversion had been done in 1864 under an order of its owner, the local merchant Mikhail Britnev. This allowed Pilot to push itself on the top of the ice and consequently break it. It's said that M.O. Britnev fashioned the bow of his ship after the shape of old wooden Pomor boats (kochs), which had been navigating icy waters of the White Sea and Barents Sea for centuries. Pilot was used between 1864-1890 for navigation in the Gulf of Finland between Kronstadt and Oranienbaum thus extending the summer navigation season by several weeks. Inspired by the success of Pilot, Mikhail Britnev built a second similar vessel \\"Boy\\" (\\"Battle\\" in Russian) in 1875 and a third \\"Booy\\" (\\"Buoy\\" in Russian) in 1889. The cold winter of 1870‚Äì1871 led to the international recognition of Britnev's design. That year the Elbe River and the port of Hamburg froze, which caused a prolonged halt of navigation and huge commercial losses. In such circumstances, Germans purchased Pilot's design from Britnev for some 300 rubles.Prolonging the navigation by Pavel Veselov. 1993. ‚Ññ 6. pp. 36-37. Thus the German Eisbrecher I appeared in 1871, and other European countries soon followed the suit. With its rounded shape and strong metal hull, Pilot had all the main features present in the modern icebreakers, therefore it is often considered the first true icebreaker. Another contender for this title is icebreaker Yermak, built in England for Russia according to the design of Admiral Stepan Makarov and under his supervision. Makarov borrowed the main principles from Pilot and applied them for creation of the first polar icebreaker, which was able to run over and crush pack ice.

The flooding affected most of the southern half of the country including the capital and some of its most productive agricultural regions. Aid officials feared the loss of crop land could seriously hinder the North's ability to feed its people, causing widespread famine. History On August 15, 2007, North Korea announced it had been hit extremely hard by floods after a solid week of torrential rains, and that it desperately needed assistance from the outside world. The previous year, the country also experienced massive flooding when torrential rains in July left hundreds if not thousands dead. The difference is this time Pyongyang reacted quickly to the disaster, requesting help while the waters were still high, rather than keeping silent as long as possible, as it has done in the past. Television footage from North Korea showed citizens in Pyongyang wading in knee- and waist-deep waters along the capital's grand boulevards. Government officials invited foreign diplomats in Pyongyang to venture out to the countryside to view first-hand the devastation wrought by the relentless rains. On August 27, North Korea said it had suspended its yearly showcase Arirang mass games. The performance resumed after the flood damage was cleared away. By August 31, North Korea reported recovering from devastating floods thanks to vigorous work by its citizens and officials. Railway services had resumed with many sections of broken track restored. Telecommunications workers were reported restoring destroyed or submerged electrical cables. Yet, the dispatch made no mention of foreign assistance. The country's leader Kim Jong-Il thanked the leaders of 11 countries on September 11 for their help in flood relief, except South Korea even though they sent 37.4 billion won (39.8 million dollars) of relief aid. Farmland The flooding submerged, buried or washed away more than 11 percent of the country's rice and corn fields. The North is especially susceptible to bad weather because of a vicious circle where people strip hillsides of natural vegetation to create more arable land to grow food ‚Äî increasing the risk of floods. On August 16, 2007, Paul Lysley, spokesperson for the WFP Asia, has estimated the damage to crops alone at 450,000 tons. The United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported some 223,381 hectares of farmland were damaged, with about 20 percent of North Korea's paddy fields and 15 percent of its corn fields flooded or washed away. Relief aid On August 17, 2007, Seoul, South Korea decided to provide $7.5 million in flood relief to North Korea. Initial aid shipments included noodles, drinking water, powdered milk, blankets and medicines. On August 23, 2007, a convoy of 34 trucks carrying emergency food rations, water and other goods left South Korea for the North. Seoul has pledged to provide 7.1 billion won ($7.6 million) in aid. NGOs such as the Red Cross also asked people to raise funds because they feared a humanitarian catastrophe. On August 29, Japan considered sending humanitarian aid to North Korea to help it recover from devastating floods. Sending aid would be a reversal for Japan, which has previously linked aid to resolving a row over North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens. Japan has not sent any humanitarian aid to North Korea since late 2004, in protest at a lack of progress over Japanese nationals kidnapped by Pyongyang in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The United Nations requested US$14 million to provide North Korea with food, medicine, drinking water and other emergency goods. The United States pledged at least US$100,000 for the U.N.

It provided forced labor for the Siebel aircraft manufacturer under agreement with the SS- Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (SS-WVHA). In 1944, during the Allied bombardment of Germany, it received many inmates from the Birkhahn camp, a Nazi Germany Buchenwald sub-camp, near Weimar, and became known as the Halle- Siebel or Birkhahn-M√∂tzlich camp. Laborers were also provided to the \\"Bauleitung Professor Doktor Ingenieur Rimpl, Kostenstell B-XII\\".International Tracing Service catalog At a cost of six/four Reichsmarks per day, skilled/unskilled laborers were used in the metalworking department to construct parts for airplane wings. Laborers worked a total of 166,364 hours in December 1944.January 1945 report by Arbeitseinsatzf√ºhrer or chief of labor allocation for the Buchenwald camp\\" Siebel employed 10,159 skilled workers and 4,965 auxiliary workers in December. The workday at the factory was 10.5 hours long. The camp at Boelkestrasse 70 consisted of at least five blocks and one block for SS guards. Several transport lists showing the movement of prisoners from Buchenwald to Halle have survived. The total number of inmates suggested by the Halle lists added together far exceed the numbers shown on SS monthly reports for Siebel-Halle from the same period. In late July 1944, 525 inmates were transported from Buchenwald to Halle with an additional 515 inmates on July 31. Although these lists provide no breakdown by nationality, most of the inmates appear to have been Russian, Polish and perhaps Czech. Prisoner transports continued to arrive in Halle throughout the following months, and the number of inmates imprisoned in the subcamp both increased and decreased at various intervals during its eight-month existence. Generally the pattern of incoming transports increased throughout the fall of 1944, and by January 1945, some inmates were shifted from Halle to other subcamps. Seven inmates were deported from Buchenwald to Halle on August 10, 1944, mostly French political prisoners. Additional transports from Buchenwald arrived throughout August and September, and the number of prisoners transferred to Halle exceeded two thousand. However, these numbers differ from monthly reports from Halle filed by the SS administration of the camp. According to a monthly reports dated August 13/14, 1944, the Siebel-Halle camp had 525 inmates. From September 1 to 20, 1944, one thousand inmates were transferred to Siebel-Halle from Buchenwald (five hundred on September 2, five hundred on September 12). On September 27, an additional transport of twenty inmates was sent to Halle. Beginning in January 1945, inmates were transferred from Halle to the Buchenwald subcamp in Annaburg. Ninety-seven inmates were transferred to Annaburg in December 1944. Between January 1 and 31, 1945, there appear to have been no transports to Halle from Buchenwald, and on February 2, seven inmates were transferred to Halle, with an additional five on March 23, 1945. Another report from March 25, 1945 shows that on January 1, 1945, Siebel-Halle had 633 inmates and on March 6, 1945, it had 528 inmates. In November 1944, at least one inmate was appointed as Block√§ltester (), ten inmates worked in the kitchen barracks, one inmate assigned to Stubendienst (barracks orderly duty) for each of the five blocks and one for the SS barracks, as well as two barbers and a cobbler. The inmates were divided into several commandos that included clearing rubble from air raids, as well as other construction and repair work in addition to those sent to Siebel. At least twenty SS guards were transferred from Halle to an unknown assignment in January 1945, but no additional information in camp reports or correspondence on the number or the ranks of guards in Halle can be found. Transgressions such as neglecting or stepping away from a running machine were punishable by denying the offending prisoner his mid-day meal as well as his allotment of cigarettes.\\"several communications with Noll regarding the behavior of individual prisoners\\" In at least one instance, cigarette rations of several prisoners were recommended to be raised due to excellent performance.\\"a telegram from the Halle factory to SS-Hauptscharf√ºhrer Noll dated October 18, 1944\\" In the Halle Revier or infirmary in January and February 1945, about fifty inmates received ambulatory care, and thirty were admitted to the infirmary.January‚ÄìFebruary 1945, \\"SS monthly reports\\" The monthly report from February 1945 also indicated one prisoner death, and that food supplies were \\"sufficient.\\" The subcamp in Halle was last noted in German records on March 31, 1945.

It is an active U.S. Navy facility and a former Naval Air Station, with its non-aviation activity now known as NETPDC Saufley Field. Although still listed as a Naval Outlying Field (NOLF) in flight information publications (FLIP), its previous aeronautical role as NOLF Saufley Field in support of primary Student Naval Aviator training at Training Air Wing FIVE at nearby NAS Whiting Field has been suspended pending runway and airfield upgrades and it is currently listed in the FLIP as a \\"closed\\" facility for aircraft operations.https://skyvector.com/?id=KNUN&zoom;=2 As Naval Education and Training Professional Development Center (NETPDC) Saufley Fieldhttps://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=94459, the facility also function as a shore installation for various naval activities that are part of the greater Pensacola naval complex. Saufley Field is located north of NAS Pensacola.  History  The U.S. Navy leased what was then known as \\"Felton's Farm Field\\" for use as an outlying field of NAS Pensacola from 1933 and it purchased the site on 16 August 1939. The base opened for operations on 26 August 1940 and is named after LTJG Richard C. Saufley, USN, Naval Aviator No. 14. Saufley was killed 9 June 1916 in the crash of a Curtiss Model E hydroplane, AH-8, off of Pensacola during an attempted long-endurance flight. The installation was originally commissioned in 1943 as Naval Auxiliary Air Station Saufley Field and was redesignated Naval Air Station Saufley Field in 1968. NAS Saufley Field's historical role was the initial primary training of Student Naval Aviators (SNA). It continued in this mission through 1 December 1976, when it was home to Training Squadron ONE (VT-1) and Training Squadron FIVE (VT-5), flying the T-34B Mentor, the land-based and T-28B Trojan and aircraft carrier landing-capable T-28C Trojan, respectively. With the introduction of the T-34C Turbomentor version of the T-34 Mentor in 1976, VT-1 and VT-5 were disestablished, NAS Saufley Field's control tower was closed and its status as an active Naval Air Station was changed to that of a Naval Outlying Field (NOLF) supporting NAS Pensacola and NAS Whiting Field. In 1979, Saufley Field was redesignated as both NOLF Saufley Field and Naval Education and Training Program Development Center (NAVEDTRAPRODEVCEN) Saufley Field following the latter activity's relocation from the nearby NETPDC Ellyson Field (the former NAS Ellyson Field), Florida that was slated for closure. With NETPDC's relocation, the non-aviation portion of the installation was renamed NETPDC Saufley Field. In 1987, NETPDC was rendesignated as the Naval Education and Training Program Management Support Activity (NETPMSA). In 1996, NETPMSA was redesignated as the Naval Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center (NETPDTC), a major shore command. In 2016, the command dropped the \\"technology\\" portion from its title due to organizational realignments within the Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) and became the Naval Education and Training Professional Development Center (NETPDC).https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=94459 As the host command for Saufley Field, NETPDC supports 10 major DoD and Navy tenant commands and has a total base population in excess of 1,000 personnel. Among the tenant commands represented at NETPDC Saufley Field are the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) and Navy Operational Support Center Pensacola. NOSC Pensacola, previously known as Naval Reserve Center Pensacola, supports several colocated Navy Reserve surface and shore- based support units, as well as providing Reserve-specific administrative support for Reserve Component Naval Aviator flight instructors, Naval Flight Officer flight instructors and other Selected Reserve (SELRES) and Full-Time Support (FTS) Reserve Component personnel physically assigned to Training Air Wing FIVE at NAS Whiting Field and Training Air Wing SIX at NAS Pensacola.http://www.militarynewcomers.com/PENSACOLA/resources/03commands.html In its concurrent role as NOLF Saufley Field, the installation currently has two inactive uncontrolled 4000 foot runways. The installation also has a permanent structural fire/rescue contingent and the capability to support an aircraft crash/fire/rescue detachment from the NAS Pensacola Fire Department, as well as in excess of of hangar space to support training aircraft.Saufley Field at GlobalSecurity.org NOLF Saufley Field and has frequently functioned as a temporary home base for turboprop and helicopter training aircraft when airfield construction projects at the local naval air stations has necessitated temporary relocation of flight operations. The Saufley VOR is also located on the installation in the center of the airfield proper. In 1988, Federal Prison Camp Pensacola was established at Saufley Field by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to provide minimum security inmate manpower to various components of the Pensacola Naval Complex. The agreement between the Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Navy is similar to existing ones with the U.S. Air Force in the establishment of minimum security Federal Prison Camps at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama and Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Saufley Field's prison camp has a fluctuating population, but can house up to 600 inmates, with over half always dedicated to provide non-sensitive labor manpower to the maintenance of Navy installations in the area. Inmate labor is primarily used statutorily for ground maintenance and for other Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) programs. The prison camp has a staff of about 85 personnel. In September 2004, the Department of Defense and the Federal Emergency Management Agency designated Saufley Field as a temporary Logistical Staging Area (LSA) for Federal, State and non-governmental agencies in response to Hurricane Ivan, considered one of the worst storms ever to hit the United States until that point. Unfortunately, a closed section of the Saufley Field airfield was also utilized for the Saufley Construction and Demolition Landfill. After Hurricane Ivan, debris disposal in this landfill was grossly mismanaged, resulting in potentially harmful gas emissions, a serious fire hazard, potential groundwater contamination and an air traffic hazard (e.g., increased bird strike/wildlife strike hazard) were created. The private owner of the facility operating it on behalf of the Federal government declared bankruptcy, thus creating a threat to public and private property and compromising Student Naval Aviator training.https://washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/ED_9230.html Closure and mitigation of the landfill was slated to be completed by 2013.http://www.myescambia.com/government/projects/saufley-road-cd-landfill- phase-1 With the retirement of the T-34C Turbomentor from the Naval Air Training Command and its replacement with the T-6 Texan II, the NOLF Saufley Field portion of NETPDC Saufley Field was no longer tenable for solo flight operations by Student Naval Aviators from Training Air Wing FIVE (TRAWING 5) at NAS Whiting Field. As NAS Saufley Field in the 1960s and 1970s, the airfield contained four operational runways with lengths ranging from Runway 18/36 at 5,200 feet to Runway 14/32 at 6,035 feet. By 2002, only Runways 5/23 and 14/32 remained operational for fixed-wing aircraft and their usable lengths had been reduced to 4,000 feet.http://www.airfields- freeman.com/FL/Airfields_FL_Pensacola_NW.htm#saufleyhttp://www.airport- data.com/airport/NUN/https://skyvector.com/airport/NUN/Saufley-Field-NOLF- Airport As opposed to the T-34C, the T-6 requires a minimum runway length of 4,000 feet for dual instructor/student operations and 5,000 feet for safe solo student operations under normal dry conditions. In addition, the propeller on the T-6 trainer cannot be reversed to slow the aircraft upon landing and the braking system/tires are not designed for short field landings.http://www.secnav.navy.mil/fmc/fmb/Documents/11pres/MCON_Book.pdf In 2016, Gulf Power Company leased a majority of the airfield and began installation of a 366-acre, 50 megawatt solar farm, which was completed in August 2017.http://www.pnj.com/story/money/business/2017/08/22/gulf-power- solar-facility-military-coronal-energy/587852001/ References Citations Bibliography * External links * History and photos of Saufley Field * Category:United States Naval Outlying Landing Fields Category:Airports in Florida Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Escambia County, Florida Category:Military in Florida Category:1940 establishments in Florida ","title":"Saufley Field"},{"id":"12785010","text":"Bia≈Çƒôgi refers to the following places in Poland: * Bia≈Çƒôgi, Greater Poland Voivodeship * Bia≈Çƒôgi, West Pomeranian Voivodeship ","title":"Bia≈Çƒôgi"},{"id":"12785024","text":"Crosses is the fourth studio album by the Belgian rock band Zornik, released on May 13, 2007 by Parlophone.

The only centre of the disease, in contrast to the three concentrated areas in the 2001 crisis, was on the Wales border with Shropshire. France and other European countries were also affected by the crisis. Background There were three official inquires into the foot-and-mouth epidemics and the Government‚Äôs response in the fifty years prior to the 1967 outbreak. These occurred in 1922, 1923-1924, and 1953. In the 1950s, there was a substantial outbreak across the United Kingdom. Of the thirteen years leading up to the 1967 outbreak, there were only two years that there was no reported outbreak. During this period, foot-and-mouth was prevalent across Europe. Outbreak In October 1967, a farmer from Bryn Farm in the county of Shropshire, concerned by the health of one of their sows, sought veterinary advice and the animal was found to have contracted foot-and- mouth disease. Bryn Farm was immediately put into quarantine and general animal movement was banned. The virus rapidly spread to the nearby Ellis Farm. Two cows from the latter had already been sent to market, leaving the farmers in a vulnerable position. In the following months, over 2,364 outbreaks were detected in the United Kingdom. Ninety-four percent of the cases occurred in North-West Midlands and North Wales. Reports The Minister for Agriculture, Frederick Peart, appointed a committee to investigate the outbreak. The Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Foot-and-Mouth Disease part 1 and part 2 were published on 7 March 1969 and 3 November 1969. This report became more commonly known as the Northumberland Report. It provided recommendations to keep the disease out of the country and plans for fighting the foot-and-mouth disease. Origins of the 1967-8 Foot-and-Mouth Disease Epidemic was published by the Chief Veterinary Officer, John Reid, on 7 February 1968. This report described the lessons learned from the outbreak. Aftermath After the outbreak, the United Kingdom adopted a policy to control imports from countries where foot-and-mouth is endemic. After creating this policy, the only outbreak to occur until 2001 was in 1981 on the Isle of Wight. Issues=Spread of disease According to John Bennett, a young farmer at the time of the crisis at Manor Farm in Worcestershire, the disease was introduced into the county \\"when a local farmer fed skimmed milk, bought from Shropshire where the disease was raging out of control, to his pigs\\". Animal slaughter Over the course of six months, 430,000 animals across 2300 farms were slaughtered. The average number of animals that were slaughtered in each confirmed case was around 200. Human transmission The 1967 crisis saw the last reported case of human foot-and-mouth disease. The victim was a farm- worker who was believed to have contracted the virus by consuming contaminated milk. The disease was not life-threatening and they were able to recover within several weeks. In popular culture The outbreak was referenced by the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. It also featured in the drama series Heartbeat.

A long serving member of the London County Council, she holds the record for being one of the two shortest-serving female Members of Parliament (MP).Centre for Advancement of Women in Politics: Records  Career  A graduate of the London School of Economics, she married Hugh Dalton, later a Labour Party Member of Parliament, in 1914; they had one child, a daughter. The family lived at West Leaze, Aldbourne, Wiltshire and at Carlisle Mansions, Carlisle Place, London. In 1925 she was elected a member of the London County Council.Centre for Advancement of Women in Politics: Women MPs Elected 1918-1929 Her husband was MP for Peckham in South London, later a solidly Labour seat, but then highly marginal; his majority in 1924 was only 947 votes. He had been selected as Labour candidate for the safe seat of Bishop Auckland in County Durham, where the sitting MP Ben Spoor was retiring, but Spoor died shortly before Christmas 1928, necessitating a by-election. However, Hugh Dalton could not stand without resigning his Peckham seat, and the candidate selected to succeed him in Peckham was John Beckett, then MP for Gateshead, so Hugh Dalton could not stand without triggering another two by- elections. The Bishop Auckland Constituency Labour Party therefore needed a candidate who would agree to stand down at the next general election. The seventy-strong general committee unanimously chose Ruth Dalton, because she could be relied on to make way for her husband as soon as Parliament was dissolved; no other candidate was even considered. Ruth Dalton duly won the by-election on 7 February with a large majority, receiving 57% of the votes cast, and served until Parliament was dissolved on 10 May for the 1929 general election. She had thus been a Member of Parliament for only 92 days, a record. It was equalled 45 years later by Margo MacDonald, the Scottish National Party MP for Glasgow Govan from 8 November 1973 to 8 February 1974. Dalton did not enjoy the House of Commons, and as agreed did not stand for Parliament again. She felt that more work was accomplished on London County Council, where she held her seat as an elected member until 1931, then returning from 1935 to 1942 as an alderman, including a period as Chairman of the Parks Committee. She later served on the Board of Governors of the Royal Ballet and from 1957 to 1962 was on the Arts Council. Her husband was made a life peer in 1960, and she was then known as Lady Dalton.

On June 25, 1999, there was a fire at the old Anderson High School building due to an unknown cause; the historic Wigwam gym was spared.http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/fire-engulfs-old-anderson-high- school/article_292360ab-8f7e-5b23-bd7d-934a0d95ba30.html Two schools were located outside Anderson city limits, but have since been incorporated into the Anderson Community School System.

Life Bray was born in 1811 and his education included time in the school run by Mary Franklin. He would have attended chapel every day. Bray became a prosperous ribbon manufacturer who owned the Coventry Herald newspaper. His father had died in 1835, leaving him and each of his seven siblings a substantial inheritance. Charles married Caroline \\"Cara\\" Hennell (4 June 1814 ‚Äì 21 February 1905) on 26 May 1836 at Hackney in Middlesex. A disciple of the social reformer Robert Owen, he used the wealth generated from his businesses to establish nonsectarian public schools and to try to bring about changes in society. Bray was a freethinker in religious matters and a progressive in politics. He was also a disciple of the phrenologist George Combe (1788‚Äì1858). Rosehill Circle The Brays' home \\"Rosehill\\" (in Coventry, Warwickshire) was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. People who participated in the \\"Rosehill Circle\\" included (among many others) social reformer Robert Owen, philosopher/sociologist Herbert Spencer, Harriet Martineau, and transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson. Most of the people who participated in the Rosehill Circle tended to have theologies that were considerably more liberal than the average (for example, many participants cast doubt on the supernatural elements of Bible stories). The core group of the Rosehill Circle consisted of Charles Bray, his wife Caroline, and some of the members of Caroline's immediate family along with several of their close friends. The core group members from Caroline's immediate family were her sisters Mary Hennell (23 May 1802 ‚Äì 16 May 1843) and Sara Hennell (1812‚Äì1899), and her brother Charles Christian Hennell (1809‚Äì1850). Charles Hennell was a writer on theological and philosophical topics whose most important work was An Inquiry Concerning the Origin of Christianity (London, 1838). Although Caroline's father James Hennell (8 October 1782 ‚Äì 30 January 1816) was a devout Unitarian who raised his children as Unitarians, his 3 children who were core members of the Rosehill Circle all entertained serious reservations about many Unitarian beliefs. On 1 November 1843 Charles C. Hennell married Elizabeth Rebecca \\"Rufa\\" Brabant (28 September 1811 ‚Äì 1 March 1898), another core member of the Rosehill Circle. Elizabeth's father, physician Robert Herbert Brabant (14 November 1781 ‚Äì 13 May 1866), was a core member as well. Elizabeth, in the months immediately preceding her engagement and marriage to Charles Hennell, had been under commission (by a private group associated with the Rosehill Circle) to translate into English the great theological treatise Das Leben Jesu, kritisch bearbeitet by David Friedrich Strauss (1808‚Äì1874). As soon as it had been first published (in T√ºbingen, Germany ‚Äì vol. 1 in 1835, and vol. 2 in 1836), Strauss' Das Leben Jesu was recognized internationally as one of the most revolutionary and important theological treatises of the 19th century. Not surprisingly, the members of the private group which had commissioned the translation, led by the radical politician Joseph Parkes (1796‚Äì1865), were very eager to be able to read this great work in their native English. However, once it was realized that Elizabeth's marriage would mean an end to her translation work, in January 1844 it was decided that Mary Anne Evans (1819‚Äì1880) (later known as the novelist George Eliot) would take up the translating where Elizabeth had left off at the time of her marriage (which was about halfway through volume 1 of Das Leben Jesu). Mary Anne had quickly become an integral part of the Rosehill Circle after she met and befriended Charles and Caroline Hennell in November 1841. Somewhat later she became an intimate friend of Elizabeth Brabant as well (Mary Anne served as a bridesmaid at Elizabeth's wedding in 1843). Mary Anne worked on the translation of Strauss' Das Leben Jesu (fourth German edition, 2 vols., 1840) for over 2 years, and in June 1846 the fruit of her (and Elizabeth's) labor was finally published (as an anonymous translation) under the title The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined (3 vols., London: Chapman Brothers, 1846). As a leading light in the Coventry 'intelligentsia,' Bray helped to found The Coventry Labourers & Artisans Co- operative Society Circa 1840‚Äì60, which provided gardens for working men and a co-op store. Inspired by the cottage factories in Coventry, he drew up a plan for a small community based on the same system ‚Äì squares of 3‚Äì400 houses, each with their own steam engine to provide power and would be surrounded by enough land for each house to have its own allotment.

On p. iii of this book (in the Preface) Bray reveals that Mary Hennell was the author of the Appendix in vol. 2 of his The Philosophy of Necessity. Also on p. iii of this book Bray states that Mary Hennell died of consumption in March 1843. However, other unrelated, genealogical sources exist which state that Mary Hennell died on 16 May 1843.

The screenplay by Stanley Shapiro and Maurice Richlin chronicles the misadventures of a Brooklyn housewife. In 1977, it was used as the basis for the Hindi film Aap Ki Khatir. Plot synopsis Henrietta and Pete Robbins are a young couple struggling to get by on the income he earns as a cab driver. His pompous sister-in-law Helen delights in reminding them that an early marriage robbed him of a college education and how much better off she and her husband Fred are. When Pete gets an inside tip on pork belly futures, Henrietta borrows $3,000 from a Mafia loan shark to purchase the commodity. Unfortunately, its value doesn't increase as rapidly as she anticipated. When she's unable to pay her debt, her contract is sold to Mrs. Cherry, a grandmotherly-type who operates a prostitution ring. When Henrietta's initial attempts at entertaining clients prove to be less than successful, her contract is sold yet again...and again, as Henrietta fails to fulfill the requirements of each new individual to whom she becomes indebted -- each time for more money -- and tries to keep her new enterprises (bomber, then cattle rustler) secret from her unsuspecting husband.

The movie was filmed on location in Brooklyn, New York and Los Angeles. Critical reception In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called the film \\"an often boisterously funny old-time farce\\" and added \\"The movie may not hold together as any kind of larger comic statement, but the laughs are self-sustaining throughout...Miss Streisand's comedy range is narrow, like a cartoon character's, but For Pete's Sake operates almost entirely within that range. She's at her best in this kind of farce.\\"New York Times review Time Out London writes \\"Yates sure is an erratic talent...Here he's adrift in a sea of poor performances and bad comic timing.\\"Time Out London review Notes There is also a 1966 movie by the name of For Pete's Sake that is based on various personal experiences from people who attended at least one of the Billy Graham Crusades.

Born in Trikala,Kastaniotis.com Hatzigakis studied Law at the University of Athens where he gained his bachelor's degree. He obtained a master's degree from the University College London, United Kingdom in Economics and from the Sorbonne of Paris, France in political science.CV at Hellenic Parliament website Political career Sotirios Hatzigakis is a 4th generation politician. He is the offspring of a big political family in Greece. The first Hatzigakis that entered the Parliament was elected in the 1892 Greek legislative election. Since 1892, the Hatzigakis family has always had a representative in the Parliament. Hatzigakis is also the cousin of Evangelos Averoff who was Foreign Minister of Greece and Defense Minister of Greece during the 1960s and 1970s and one of the leading figures in the New Democracy (ND). Following the collapse of the Greek military junta of 1967-1974, Hatzigakis decided to run for parliament MP with ND. In the 1974 Greek legislative election, Hatzigakis was elected first in his electorate district Trikala and became the youngest member in the Parliament at the age of only 29. Harzigakis has been elected 13 consecutive times, in the legislative elections of 1974, 1977, 1981, 1985, June 1989, November 1989, 1990, 1993, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2007, and 2009. From the outset of his political career, Hatzigakis was involved in the accession negotiations of Greece with the European Economic Community. When his cousin Evangelos Averoff was elected the leader of New Democracy in 1981, he tried to renew the party by bringing in new politicians and getting rid of the old guard. During that period, Hatzigakis was considered his right-hand man. In 1989, New Democracy formed a coalition government with the Coalition of the Left and Progress which at the time included the Communist Party of Greece. The government was headed by Tzannis Tzannetakis and Hatzigakis first entered the Cabinet of Greece as Alternate Minister for the National Economy and Minister for Labour. The government was soon replaced by two further short-lived governments under Yiannis Grivas and Xenophon Zolotas. With the 1990 elections, New Democracy managed to form a single-party government under its leader Constantine Mitsotakis. Hatzigakis was appointed Alternate Minister for Trade in 1990 and Minister for Agriculture from 1991 to 1992. He resigned over matters of principle. He re-entered the Cabinet as Minister for Justice on 19 September 2007, following New Democracy's victory in the 2007 parliamentary election.\\"New Greek government announced\\", ANA (hri.org), September 18, 2007. From 8 January to 7 October 2009, he served again as Minister for Rural Development and Food. Hatzigakis has published numerous articles and studies on political, social and economic affairs. He has also participated in many international conferences and parliamentary missions. Hatzigakis is the author of 14 books. Currently he is the longest-serving member of the Hellenic Parliament.

He collaborates with professional astronomers and works with big telescopes located at La Palma in the Canary Islands, and at Mauna Kea Observatories at the Hawaiian Islands. He publishes his pictures in astronomical magazines and has written a book on astrophotography called Infinity Rising. His imaging and image-processing abilities brought him the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 2004.

Originally composed for organ in October 1916, it was orchestrated the following year. The organ version was both commissioned and premiered by Eric DeLamarter at Fourth Presbyterian Church in Chicago on October 20, 1916. Because the piece was so well received, DeLamarter then asked the composer for an orchestral version, which he led in an all-Sowerby concert in Chicago in January 1917. With the score's publication in 1919 by the Boston Music Company, writes Francis Crociata of the Leo Sowerby Foundation, Comes Autumn Time was soon performed \\"in Boston by Pierre Monteux, Philadelphia by Stokowski, Minneapolis by Ganz, New York by Damrosch, London by Harty and Wood, Berlin by Rosbaud, and Vienna by Bruno Walter.\\" The piece is one of Sowerby's most popular, and was inspired by a poem by Bliss Carman entitled \\"Autumn\\". (In tribute to Carman's contribution to the piece's origin, Sowerby directed that a copy of the poem be included with every printed copy of the score, a practice which is still carried on today.) The piece became a personal favorite of Frederick Stock, then Music Director of what is now the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; upon Stock's death in 1942, the piece was played at his funeral at Stock's request. The work opens with an exuberant and lively theme played on the bass clarinet, horns, and low strings. A transition in the woodwinds bring on the second main subject, iterated by flutes and celesta against a harp and clarinet background. The first subject is then developed, the second returning only in the recapitulation, followed by the first. The piece finishes with a brilliant and lively coda, developed from the second theme.Crociata, Francis. CD album essay for Freeman, Paul (conductor); Czech National Symphony Orchestra.

One of the oldest cities in Poland, Kalisz also played a pivotal role in Polish Jewish history: in 1264, Boles≈Çaw I the Pious, ruler of the western part of Poland (Wielkopolska), was the first to grant a charter to the local Jewish community, giving them settlement rights, legal protection, and certain religious and financial freedoms. This \\"Statute of Kalisz\\" was extended to the whole country by King Casimir the Great and expanded by later Polish rulers. It provided the legal foundation for Jewish rights in Poland. History from the 12th century to World War I There had probably been Jews in Kalisz since the 12th century, when refugees from the Crusader massacres fled to Poland from the Rhineland. Coins from the area stamped with names in Hebrew letters reveal that Jewish minters were active in the town during the 12th century. As Polish Jewry developed rapidly in the early modern period, so did the Kalisz Jewish community. In the mid-14th century, Kalisz Jews received permission to build a synagogue, which stood for over four centuries until destroyed by fire. The Kalisz Jewish community played an important role in the Council of the Four Lands, the supracommunal body that represented Polish Jewry to the king. Jews made their living as moneylenders, craftsmen, and import-export merchants dealing in livestock, horses, agricultural produce and textiles. The Jewish merchants of Kalisz played an important role at the international fairs in the German cities of Leipzig and Breslau. The Jewish population declined somewhat in the 17th and 18th centuries, due to the disruption of the Polish-Swedish War (1655‚Äì1659), as well as fires and plague in the 18th century. Even so, by 1793‚Äîwhen the region was annexed by Prussia‚ÄîJews owned about a quarter of the buildings in the town. At that time Jews constituted 40 percent of the population of Kalisz; they dominated the textile trade and made up half the craftsmen in the town. From 1815 until 1914 Kalisz was under Russian rule. Russian authorities expelled Jewish residents who lacked Russian citizenship from Kalisz in 1881. A few years later, by 1897, the Jewish population of the town numbered 7,580 or about one-third of the total population. Economy Over the course of the 19th century, Jews continued to play a leading role in the local economy. Indeed, Christian business leaders in Kalisz, hostile to Jewish competition, pressured the Russian authorities to create a special Jewish quarter where Jews would be required to live. The quarter was established in 1827, when Jews made up about a third of the population. After the arrival of the railroad in the 1870s, industry developed rapidly. Products included textiles, woolens, and‚Äîmost importantly -- lace. Indeed, lacework and embroidery became the principal industry in Kalisz, which was known as the lacework capital of the Russian Empire. Many Jews made their living from it, whether as industrialists, middlemen, or factory workers. By the early 20th century, Jews owned 32 of the 67 factories in the town. In 1904, Jews made up over half of Kalisz lace workers. Most of the Jews in Kalisz, however, were poor laborers or artisans. Religious Life Kalisz had already become an important spiritual center by the 17th century. In the 19th century, the pietist revival movement called \\"Hasidism\\" began to affect the town. The first Hasidic sect to gain followers in Kalisz were the Kotskers, followed by the Ger and Alexander Hasidim. By the 1890s Kalisz boasted two large synagogues and close to 40 smaller prayer houses. Three more synagogues, including one in the style of German Reform Judaism, were built in Kalisz in the first decade of the 20th century. In the last half-century of Russian rule, as was the case throughout the Russian Empire, traditionalist Jews (both Hasidic and non-Hasidic) battled modernizers over issues such as education and the rabbinate. Political parties Kalisz also had an array of Jewish political parties around the turn of the 20th century: mainstream Zionist, labor Zionist, religious Zionist, and socialist Bundist. These differing political visions were mirrored in the Jewish schools of Kalisz which by World War I included a bilingual Jewish high school, two Yiddish-oriented schools, and an Orthodox educational network of 1,800 students. World War I and aftermath German destruction of Kalisz, 1914 During the first year of World War I, the invading German army destroyed 95% of Kalisz in a deliberate act committed on a defenceless city, and killed 33 Jews. Some 60,000 citizens left in the August 1914 exodus. Five years later, in the course of Poland's struggle for independence from the German Empire (see: Greater Poland Uprising featuring Batalion Pograniczny formed in Kalisz), two Jews lost their lives in the city in March 1919. Jewish sources deemed their deaths a pogrom, and the PMO members, fighting for independence, Polish nationalists. Interwar years Kalisz had a population of 15,300 Jews (almost 30 percent of the total population), according to the 1931 Polish census. The Jewish neighborhood of Kalisz was in the northwest area of the central city, along the main Nowa Street boulevard. Nowa and adjacent streets were the site of the Great Synagogue and the House of Study. Along its expanse were the offices of Jewish organizations and clubs, as well as many Jewish shops ranging from large stores to small shops to tiny holes in the wall: bookstores, taverns, shops selling Hebrew and Yiddish newspapers, butchers, fish stores, and boutiques. The bridge that carried Nowa Street over a branch of the Prosna River was the heart of Jewish activity. It was a place of constant traffic, with Jews coming and going between their homes and places of work, synagogues, and communal institutions. On this bridge business deals were closed; the unemployed stood and hoped to be chosen for a few hours' work; people gave and listened to political speeches and arguments; vendors sold snacks and drinks. Jews lived in other parts of town as well. Kanonicka Street was also a heavily Jewish area and served as home of the kehillah (community governing body) offices. Well-to-do Jewish families lived in various areas of the city. Jewish caf√© life also thrived. The most popular gathering place was the Udzia≈Çowa Caf√©, where many people had regular tables and meeting times. Mayer Caf√©, renowned for its delicious cakes, was the place for the Polish gentry, the Polish and Jewish middle class, professionals, and intellectuals. Young people hung out at the Caf√© George, where members of all the Jewish youth movements could mingle‚Äîor, when politics dictated, sit at separate tables. The Jews of Kalisz were not immune from the antisemitism that swept across Poland in the late 1930s. The town had an active antisemitic press, and bands of ruffians would often attack Jewish traders and peddlers on isolated roads as they were making their way to area markets. The situation deteriorated to the point that in 1936 a delegation of merchants traveled to Warsaw to present their case to the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Interior. In 1937, Jews were forced to set up shop in a separate area in the town market, and Polish nationalists stood guard to ensure that Christians did not patronize Jewish-owned stalls. A year later, Kalisz was transferred to the Poznan district, where kosher slaughtering was prohibited. Even after intensive lobbying, the Kalisz slaughterers were permitted to produce only a small amount of kosher meat, which did not suffice for the Jewish population. In 1939, on the eve of the German invasion, the Jewish population of Kalisz numbered over 20,000. Economy In the interwar period, Kalisz, which had a long history of producing lace and other textiles, became a center for the garment industry. In 1921, of the over 500 Jewish-owned factories and enterprises, 400 produced clothing or textiles (other products included metals, lumber, and leather). Flour from the 12 Jewish-owned mills in Kalisz reached all parts of Poland. There was also a handful of Jewish professionals. Since Jewish workers constituted 45 percent of all wage-earners in Kalisz, it is not surprising that Jews played an important role in the town's trade unions. Some of the unions were open to all: the Embroiderers' Union had Polish, Jewish, and German members. Other unions were more segregated: the Garment Union organization had only Jewish members, and Polish tailors and garment workers belonged to the Polish Craftsmen Society. Jewish unions included associations of leather workers, clerks, porters, and female domestic workers. The latter advocated for the rights of young women who came to Kalisz from small towns and who were often subject to the whims of their employers. The association for female domestic workers helped to ensure fair treatment, decent wages, and a rest day on the Sabbath. The two Jewish financial institutions established after World War I, the Merchants' Bank and the Cooperative Bank, failed during the Depression. As the economy deteriorated‚Äîand as the Polish government continued to adopt anti-Jewish economic policies‚Äîmany industrial workers were forced into petty commerce or peddling with few prospects for a meaningful livelihood. As was the case in Jewish communities throughout Poland, the Kalisz Jewish community founded cooperative credit and banking institutions to assist the impoverished Jewish population. Government The kehillah, or official governing body for the Jewish community, was dominated by the ultra- Orthodox Agudah political party. It administered the Jewish welfare institutions of Kalisz: old-age home, Talmud Torah (school for poor children), orphanage, Jewish hospital (founded in 1835), and free clinic. The kehillah also oversaw the ritual bath and the two yeshivahs in the town, \\"Magen Avraham\\" and \\"Etz Hayyim.\\" The traditionalist Agudah majority of the kehillah faced various challenges during the interwar period, including a boycott of kosher slaughterers organized by the Zionist opposition members in order to cut off the tax revenue that was the mainstay of kehillah income. That income was declining anyway, as the economic situation of the Jews of Kalisz deteriorated. From 1932 to 1935, revenues decreased by 30 percent. Politics As was true throughout much of interwar Poland, Jewish life in Kalisz was heavily politicized. The non-Zionist, ultra-Orthodox Agudah boasted one of the strongest local branches in the country, with separate Workers of Agudah and Daughters of Agudah associations established in 1928. Zionism was an important influence as well. In 1920, a public celebration in honor of Britain's acceptance of the mandate of Palestine was attended by thousands, and many offered contributions for the purchase of land in Palestine. The socialist Zionist party Poale Zion sponsored a \\"Worker's Home\\" club, which organized lectures, Hebrew classes, and performances and offered a library and reading room to members. In 1900, a branch of the secular Jewish socialist Bund was founded in Kalisz. Jews were also active in general political life, with eleven Jewish residents elected to the municipal council as late as 1939.  Youth movements  Youth movements played an important role in the Kalisz Jewish community, and could be found on all points of the political spectrum from the right-wing Zionist Betar organization to the communist Zionist Borochov organization. Some young Jews joined Zionist training farms in the countryside outside Kalisz to prepare for emigration to Palestine; many eventually emigrated. A number of Jewish communists from Kalisz volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Ten of them fell in battle. Schools The first modern Jewish school in Kalisz, with subjects taught in Russian, opened in 1862. Most children attended one of the seven Cheders (traditional schools for basic Jewish literacy) in Kalisz. A women's trade school opened early in the 20th century, and a bilingual Jewish gymnasium (high school) was founded in 1913. In 1917, the religious Zionist Mizrahi party founded a school as part of a national network. Orthodox educational institutions included a kindergarten, a trade school, and a girls' school called Havatselet (\\"Lily\\"). During the interwar period, two Yiddish schools were established by the labor Zionist Poale Zion group and the secular socialist \\"Bund.\\" Many local Jewish children attended Polish public schools. A branch of the national TOZ organization, dedicated to the health of Jewish children, established summer camps for the weak and sick children of the town. Cultural life Kalisz had a flourishing Jewish cultural life. In the late 1920s and 1930s, two Yiddish weeklies kept the community abreast of local, national, and international news: the Agudah-leaning Kalisher lebn (\\"Kalisz Life\\") and the Zionist-leaning Kalisher vokh (\\"Kalisz Week\\"). A group of young people established a branch of YIVO, the Jewish Scientific Society, and conducted research on Jewish folklore and linguistics. The leading figure in Jewish literary life in Kalisz was poet and author Rosa Jakobowicz (Jacobson). The daughter of a rabbi, she studied Hebrew and religious subjects in her youth. After moving to Kalisz as a newlywed, she published her poetry in various journals and periodicals, including a cycle of poems on biblical women, the first of its kind in Yiddish. A collection of her poetry was published in 1924, entitled Mayne gezangen (My Songs). Jakobowicz died in the Warsaw ghetto in 1942. The writer Shimon Horonecki (Horonski) (1889‚Äì1939) lived in Kalisz for some years and wrote novels in which can be found descriptions of working class Jewish life in Kalisz. The performing arts were also cultivated in Kalisz. Jews could enjoy performances of a Jewish orchestra, a brass band, and a theatrical troupe. Local Bund members were especially active in this arena, creating a cultural club, a drama club, a Working Women's Club, and the Comet Amateur Theater. Sports Throughout Europe, sports had become an important part of Jewish life, as the political theories of the period stressed the cultivation of the body as well as the spirit and the mind. Each Jewish political party had its own sports club, and the Gymnastics and Sports Association was an important non-political athletic, cultural, and educational organization for youth. The Jewish Rowers' Club of Kalisz participated in competitions at the national level. Religious life Model of Great Synagogue in Kalisz (Wielka Synagoga) is exposed at Jewish cemetery in Kalisz The foremost personality in the religious life of prewar Kalisz was Rabbi Yehezkel Livshits, who served as rabbi from 1907 to 1932. President of the Rabbinical Association of Poland, a Zionist, and a friend of Chief Rabbi of Palestine Abraham Isaac Kook, Livshits was a force for solidarity and unity in the Kalisz community owing to his character and high standing. After his death, Menahem Mendl Alter, son of Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter the Hasidic Rebbe of Ger, was chosen in part because of the increasing influence of the Gerer Hasidim in Kalisz. Besides Ger, which counted ten shtieblakh (small prayer houses) in the town, other Hasidic groups represented in Kalisz were Alexander, Sochaczow, Skiernewicz, Kotzk, Sokolow, Parisow, and Radomsk. In addition, the Rebbes of Zychlin and Wola lived in Kalisz. There were so many shtieblakh in Kalisz that some non-Hasidic or non-religious Jews reportedly even closed their windows on Friday nights to escape the loud singing. During the interwar period, the two formal centers of religious life were the traditionalist Great Synagogue and the modern, western-style New Synagogue, called the German Shul. The latter boasted an organ and a choir that performed pieces of liturgical music by both German-Jewish and Russian-Jewish composers. World War II The Germans invaded Poland in September 1939. This part of Poland was then incorporated into the Reich as the Warthegau. One aim was to remove or murder all Jews and to resettle people of German ancestry in the Warthegau who then lived further to the east. A large proportion of Kalisz' Jewish population, which was about 20,000, fled during the time of the military campaign. Germans occupied the city on September 6. They immediately began brutal measures against the Jews: murder, robbery, humiliations, and other abuse. Later Jews were relocated to a central location, and in late 1939, thousands were sent to other cities, including Lublin. Of the remaining, in October 1940, hundreds were murdered in a nearby forest. In 1941, about 100 were sent to Poznan for forced labor and more than 200 were murdered, some in gas vans. In 1942, the remaining Jews were sent to Poznan and to the Lodz ghetto.  Post WWII  Most of Kalisz's Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Following the war, Jewish Holocaust survivors returned to the city, by 1946 numbering some 500. In July 1946, an ultimatum letter was sent to the Jews of Kalisz threatening them with a harsher attack than the Kielce pogrom should they remain in the city. Violent attacks, persistent anti-Semitism, and difficulties in recovering their property forced most Jews to leave. By the late 1940s only some 100 remained, and those few who stayed blended into non- Jewish society.Krzyzanowski, Lukasz. \\"An Ordinary Polish Town: The Homecoming of Holocaust Survivors to Kalisz in the Immediate Aftermath of the War.\\" European History Quarterly 48.1 (2018): 92-112.

His first official appearance came exactly one month later, against FC Amkar Perm for the campaign's Russian Cup (120 minutes played, 1‚Äì0 win); his league debut occurred six days later, in a 0‚Äì0 draw at FC Anzhi Makhachkala. On 10 June 2011, Abreu scored his first goal for Krasnodar, in a 3‚Äì1 away success against FC Rostov. He left at the end of 2013‚Äì14, signing with fellow league club FC Torpedo Moscow shortly after but retiring from the game shortly after for family reasons. After two years of inactivity, 36-year-old Abreu returned to football with former club Camacha, still in the third level.

He was a mayor of Amsterdam from the Dutch Golden Age and a powerful Amsterdam regent after the sudden death of stadholder William II of Orange. Like his father Jacob Dircksz de Graeff, he opposed the house of Orange, and was the moderate successor to the republican Andries Bicker. In the mid 17th century he controlled the city's finances and politics and, in close cooperation with his brother Andries de Graeff and their nephew Johan de Witt, the Netherlands political system.Andries Bickers Biographie at the DBNL Cornelis de Graeff followed in his father footsteps and, between 1643 and 1664, was appointed mayor some ten times. De Graeff was a member of a family of regents who belonged to the republican political movement also referred to as the ‚Äòstate oriented‚Äô, as opposed to the Royalists. Cornelis de Graeff was also the founder of a regent dynasty that retained power and influence for centuries and produced a number of ministers. He was Lord of the semisouverain Fief (allodiale hoge heerlijkheid)Drs. J. L. van der Gouw: De definitieve vorm van het graafschap /holland/ (1300-1795) Zuidpolsbroek and an Ambachtsheer (Lord of the Manor) of Sloten, Sloterdijk, Nieuwer-Amstel, Osdorp and Amstelveen, near Amsterdam, and castlelord of Ilpenstein. De Graeff was also President of the Dutch East Indies Company, and a chiefcouncillor of the Admiralty of Amsterdam. Like his brother, Andries De Graeff, he was an art collector and patron of the arts. During his life De Graeff was often called \\"Polsbroek\\" or \\"Lord Polsbroek\\". Family De Graeff Cornelis de Graeff was the oldest son of Jacob Dircksz de Graeff and his wife Aeltje Boelens Loen. He grew up in the Niezel, a small street not far from the Oude Kerk. De Graeff was crippled for life in the left arm by a childhood accident, as can be seen in his painting. At twenty he went to Paris and in 1633 he married Geertruid Overlander (1609‚Äì1634), daughter of Volkert Overlander, whose brother-in-law was Frans Banning Cocq, the captain in Rembrandt's Night Watch. She died only a few months later and he remarried with Catharina Hooft, nineteen years younger and his first wife's cousin (her mother was another Geertruid Overlander, 1577‚Äì1653, the sister of Catharinas father). They had two children: Pieter de Graeff and Jacob de Graeff. The married couple inhabited a fine building with precious woodwork, not far from the city hall, at what is now Herengracht 216. Both his brother Andries and Cornelis were very critical of the Orange family‚Äôs influence. Together with the Republican political leader Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt, the De Graeff brothers strived for the abolition of stadtholdership. They desired the full sovereignty of the individual regions in a form in which the Republic of the United Seven Netherlands was not ruled by a single person. Instead of a sovereign (or stadtholder) the political and military power was lodged with the States General and with the regents of the cities in Holland. During the two decades the De Graeff family had a leading role in the Amsterdam administration, the city was at the peak of its political power. This period was also referred to by Republicans as the ‚ÄòWare Vrijheid‚Äô (True Freedom). It was the First Stadtholderless Period which lasted from 1650 to 1672. During these twenty years, the regents from Holland and in particular those of Amsterdam, controlled the republic. The city was flush with self-confidence and liked to compare itself to the famous Republic of Rome. Even without a stadtholder, things seemed to be going well for the Republic and its regents both politically and economically. Cornelis de Graeff and his younger brother Andries de Graeff ‚Äì who after Cornelis's death succeeded him as regent and mayor ‚Äì busied themselves with art and genealogy, working on their lineage. Of his five brothers and sisters, four married a Bicker, who also originated from the Niezel. Around 1650, De Graeff founded a country house, now known as the Palace Soestdijk, which was later sold by his son Jacob to stadholder William III, Prince of Orange in 1674. As the first Statesman of Amsterdam and Holland Johan and Cornelis de Witt in Dordrecht Cornelis was a merchant and administrator of the VOC, and from 1639 a member of the vroedschap and in 1643‚Äì1662 mayor ten times (by turn as magnificus, or chairing mayor with the deciding vote) in the difficult times of the First Stadtholderless Period. He began as a captain at the schutterij, and it was his company that was painted in 1642 by Jacob Adriaenszoon Backer (to be seen in the Rijkmuseum Amsterdam). In 1645 Cornelis became an advisor of the States of Holland and West Friesland. In 1648 De Graeff was one of the main figures behind the building of a new city hall on the Dam, that was inaugurated in 1655. In the failed attack on Amsterdam in 1650, De Graeff realised that Andries, Cornelis and the other Bickers had to leave the vroedschap. De Graeff was one of the prime movers behind the Peace of M√ºnster in 1648Amsterdam: a brief life of the city.

Deel 2 (nl) He reached the height of his power as chairing mayor of Amsterdam, together with Johan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen. Cornelis de Graeff was brilliant not only in living languages, but also in Greek, Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic. He never went to church, but only for political reasons. It was probably due to his influence that Nieuwe Kerk was built without a tower. He was the patron of Vondel and Jan Vos and commissioned eight paintings from Govert Flinck for the city hall. De Graeff and Johan de Witt: The true Freedom Politically important as well as personally satisfying was De Graeff's ties with his niece Wendela Bicker's husband Johan de Witt. De Witt eagerly sought De Graeff's advice and support and also enjoyed his clearness of mind and warm hospitality. Their relationship combined the closeness of family affection and the mutual respect of two strong minds as De Graeff was De Witt's equal as no one else was in Dutch politics at the time. In 1653 De Graeff made Johan de Witt a 'Grand Pensionary', a sort of chairman, of the States of Holland.Rowen, Herbert H. (1986) John de Witt - Statesman of the ‚ÄûTrue Freedom‚ÄúIsrael, Jonathan I. (1995) The Dutch Republic - Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall - 1477-1806 =De Graeff at the war between Sweden and Poland= Amsterdam and De Graeff were at the high point of their power and in 1656 mounted an expedition under Michiel de Ruyter to the Mediterranean Sea and - in Charles X Gustav of Sweden's war against Poland - another under Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam to the Baltic Sea. Fortunately for the Netherlands, this war ended in Danzig being declared neutral. The four strong-headed mayors decided to send Coenraad van Beuningen to Copenhagen to incite Denmark into a war against Sweden. To everyone's amazement, in the middle of the winter the Swedish king crossed over from Jutland, across the Great Belt, to Copenhagen. In a second expedition to relieve Copenhagen, Witte de With participated in the Battle of the Sound. Cornelis de Graeff was prepared to begin the fight against Sweden, against the advice of the Grand Pensionarys. When Charles X unexpectedly died in 1660, Sweden made peace. Amsterdam sent also admiral Michiel de Ruyter against the English, against the orders of the parliament of the Netherlands. Despite these differences in approach with De Witt, he and De Graeff stayed on good terms. De Witt in 1660 observed of Cornelis: \\"with the gentleman of Zuidpolsbroek, in nothing was to do something\\". =De Graeff and William III of Orange= Soestdijk, painted by Thomas de Keyser and Jacob van Ruisdael (1656-1660). On 25 September 1660 the States of Holland under the prime movers of De Witt, De Graeff, his younger brother Andries de Graeff and Gillis Valckenier resolved to take charge of William III of Oranges education to ensure he would acquire the skills to serve in a future‚Äîthough undetermined‚Äîstate function.Troost, 43 During the summers the family spent a lot of their time at the Palace Soestdijk, and the sons of De Graeff played with the young William - who became later King of England, Scotland and Ireland and stadtholder of the United Provinces of the Netherlands - at the lake and woods at Palace Soestdijk. After the rampjaar his son Jacob sold it to stadholder William III. The rear of the townhall by Gerrit Berckheyde. The Dutch Gift In 1660 the Dutch Gift was organized by the regents, especially the powerful brothers Cornelis and Andries de Graeff. The sculptures for the gift were selected by the pre-eminent sculptor in the Netherlands, Artus Quellinus, and Gerrit van Uylenburgh, the son of Rembrandt's dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh, advised the States-General on the purchase. The Dutch Gift was a collection of 28 mostly Italian Renaissance paintings and 12 classical sculptures, along with a yacht, the Mary, and furniture, which was presented to King Charles II of England by the States- General of the Netherlands in 1660.Whittaker and Clayton: pp. 31-2 for the art, Gleissner for the furniture and yacht. The yacht was the gift of the Dutch East India Company, according to Liverpool Museums (with model) , or the City of Amsterdam according to other sources. Most of the paintings and all the Roman sculptures were from the Reynst collection, the most important seventeenth-century Dutch collection of paintings of the Italian sixteenth century, formed in Venice by Jan Reynst (1601-1646) and extended by his brother, Gerrit Reynst (1599-1658). The gift reflected the taste Charles II shared with his father, Charles I, whose large collection, one of the most magnificent in Europe, had mostly been sold abroad after he was executed in 1649. The collection was given to him to mark his return to power in the English Restoration, before which Charles had spent many years in exile in the Dutch Republic during the rule of the English Commonwealth. It was intended to strengthen diplomatic relations between England and the Republic, but only a few years after the gift the two nations would be at war again in the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665‚Äì1667. Death Cornelis's tomb chapel is to be found of in the Oude Kerk, and after his death his younger brother Andries and the cunning Gillis Valckenier took over his role on the council. After De Graeff's death Johan de Witt lost his power and reputation in Amsterdam and afterwards in the Province Holland. Historiography De Graeff communicated in a soft and exemplary way and was honest and open, a novelty for the young republic, and felt that it was De Witt who had brought Amsterdam and its interests to their present good fortune. Also De Graeff never drove Amsterdam's affairs onto the rocks, but had a good eye for the interests of the other towns of Holland and avoided a mode of power- politics that would have left Amsterdam isolated. Aims Brugmans states that De Graeff's aims were nearly always administrative and political - the power of Amsterdam in Holland, and the power of the Republic, was only as great as their social power, including the limitation of the power of the House of Orange.Brugmans, H. (1973) Geschiedenis van Amsterdam. Deel III Bloeitijd, 1621-1697, p. 159-67. One point, however, is emphasised by Brugmans - that only De Graeff (out of all Amsterdam's politicians) was ever elected grand pensionary and then entirely successful in pleasing Amsterdam. The regent's descendant Adriaen Pauw was also elected as such in 1651. Noble titlesNotesLiterature * Israel, Jonathan I.

It is the first game in the Borderlands series, developed by Gearbox Software, and published by 2K Games for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows, Mac OS X and Shield Android TV. The game was released worldwide in October 2009, with the Mac OS X version being released on December 3, 2010 by Feral Interactive. The game's story focuses on a group of four \\"Vault Hunters\\", who travel to the distant planet of Pandora to search for the \\"Vault\\", which is rumored to contain advanced alien technology and other priceless riches. The hunters piece together clues to find the Vault while battling the savage wildlife of Pandora and the bandits and outlaws that populate the planet, ultimately banding together to prevent the Atlas Corporation and its privately-funded paramilitary forces from reaching the Vault first. The game features the ability to explore the in-game world, and complete both main missions and optional side quests, either in single-player or online cooperative gameplay, with the latter providing additional options for duels and competitive PVP matches in designated areas. Gameplay features include access to various weapons and shields that vary in type and statistics, weapons with special elemental functions, each playable character having distinctive class types and unique abilities for combat, upgradable skills, and the use of two-person vehicles. The game itself is rendered in cartoon-style graphics, to provide greater detail on weapons and environments, and was inspired by various action role-playing games of the time, such as Ultima and Diablo. Borderlands received favourable reviews upon its release, and sold over two million units by the end of 2009. Its success spawned four DLCs‚ÄîThe Zombie Island of Dr. Ned in November 2009, Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot in December 2009, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx in February 2010, and Claptrap's New Robot Revolution in September 2010‚Äîand three follow-ups, Borderlands 2 in September 2012, Borderlands 3 in September 2019, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel in 2014. A remastered version for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One‚Äî was released on April 3, 2019, which features graphical enhancements, and gameplay improvements backported from Borderlands 2. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released alongside Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel in the Borderlands Legendary Collection for release in May 2020. Gameplay Lilith, the siren (left) and Mordecai, the hunter (far right) prepare to attack the Rakk Hive, one of the enemies in the game Borderlands includes character-building elements found in role-playing games, leading the developer Gearbox Software to call the game a \\"role-playing shooter\\". At the start of the game, players select one of four characters, each with a unique special skill and with proficiencies with certain weapons. From then on, players take on missions assigned through non- player characters or from bounty boards, each typically rewarding the player with experience points, money, and sometimes a reward item. Players earn experience by killing both human and non-human foes and completing in-game challenges (such as getting a certain number of kills using a specific type of weapon). As they gain levels from experience growth, players can then allocate skill points into a skill tree that features three distinct specializations of the base character; for example, Mordecai can become specialized in sniping, gunslinging with revolvers, or using his pet Bloodwing to assist in kills and health boosting. Players can distribute points among any of the specializations, and can also spend a small amount of in-game money to redistribute their skill points. Players start the game with the ability to equip two weapons but later gain up to four weapon slots, as well as slots for an energy shield, a grenade modification, and a class modification. Items collected can be sold back at vendors for money that then can be used to buy better items. One of the key features of Borderlands is the randomly generated weapons and items created either as dropped by enemies, found in storage chests about the game, on the ground, sold at vendors in the game, or as quest reward items. The game uses a \\"Procedural Content Creation System\\" to create these weapons and items, which can alter their firepower, rate of fire, and accuracy, add in elemental effects such as a chance to set foes on fire or cover them in burning acid, and at rare times other special bonuses such as regenerating the player's ammo. A color-coded scale is used to indicate the rarity of the weapon or item. It was estimated that the random system could generate over 17 million variations of weapons, but actually only resulted in a little over 3,500,000. The Procedural system is also used to create the characteristic of random enemies that the player may face. This allows for enemies of the same species to have widely varying attacks: for example, variations of \\"spiderants\\" in the game could leap around and would jump onto players' faces, while another variant can roll up into a ball and attack people, depending on the content generator. When in combat, the player can take damage if their shield is depleted, affecting their health. If they lose all their health, they must either wait to be revived by another player or attempt to kill an enemy to achieve a \\"second wind\\", or otherwise will be regenerated back at the last \\"New-U\\" station that they passed, losing a 'ratio-appropriate' percentage of their money in the process. Players quickly gain access to two-passenger vehicles, and can engage in vehicular combat with other enemies. Eventually, a system of fast transit points between the game world is available to the player; until then, players must walk or drive between areas to get around. The game can be played alone, but also supports two-player cooperative play through split-screen (on consoles), and up to four players playing cooperatively online or over LAN. The game follows the progress of the host player, rewarding the other active players for completion of quests for their characters. If the other players are doing the same quests in their campaign, the completed quests remain the same in their campaign as well as the host's. When more players are present, the game alters the statistics of the generated enemies, balancing the game due to the larger number of players. Players can take part in one-on-one duels anywhere in the game world, or can visit arenas in the game world to participate in free-for- all, 2-on-2 or 3-on-1 combat battles with their fellow players. The original title as shipped for Windows used GameSpy servers for multiplayer modes; as a result of GameSpy's shutdown in 2013, 2K Games patched the game and moved the servers to Steam, as well as providing Steam-versions of the game for those that purchased the title through retail channels. Plot=Setting Borderlands is set in the distant future of 2864 AD, at a time when various mega-corporations seek control of various planets to colonise and mine for their mineral wealth and resources. Prior to the events of the game, the Atlas Corporation, one of the major mega-corporations, uncovered an ancient alien Vault filled with advanced weapons technology, allowing them to rapidly overtake their competitors. Finding similar ruins of the same alien architecture on the planet Pandora, Atlas sought to settle the planet in hopes of finding more alien technology, but were forced to abandon their plans due to a failure to find any alien technology on the surface, and being unprepared for the dangerous wildlife coming out during their stay. After their departure, the Dahl Corporation, another mega-corporation, colonized the planet to secure its vast deposits of minerals, using large amounts of convict labor for the mining operations, while initiating their own search for a Vault. Their research team's efforts to find the Vault were headed up by Patricia Tannis, a respected xenoarchaeologist. Despite losing all of her colleagues to the planet's wildlife and being driven partially insane herself, Tannis found proof that a Vault does exist on Pandora. Her news was intercepted by Atlas, who sent its private military force, the Crimson Lance, to kidnap Tannis and get the Vault's location from her. Faced with their invasion, Dahl abandoned the planet, taking only the wealthy colonists with them, and leaving the remaining population to scavenge for a living amongst the barren wastelands and industrial trash heaps across the planet. To make matters worse, the convict labor was allowed to go free, leading them to form gangs of bandits that terrorize the local populace. Despite the circumstances, the Vault and its rewards transformed into a legend that attracts mercenary \\"Vault Hunters\\" to the planet. Characters There are four playable characters featured in the game for players to choose from: Brick - a large, powerful man, who operates as a Berserker; Lilith - a woman with powerful alien abilities, operating as a Siren; Mordecai - a skilled marksman with an avian companion named Bloodwing, operating as a Hunter; and Roland - a former member of the Crimson Lance, operating as a Soldier. Each character's class defines the style of weaponry they specialise in, along with the unique skill they can use - Brick can enter a rage state for increased melee strength and a short period of health regeneration; Lilith can turn invisible to enemies, moving much faster in this state, and capable of shock blasts when entering and exiting this state; Mordecai can call his companion to attack enemies in his crosshairs; and Roland can utilize an automated turret to take on enemies, and provide additional cover. Story Borderlands begins some time after the Dahl Corporation's abandonment of the planet Pandora. Four Vault Hunters (Brick, Lilith, Mordecai, and Roland) arrive in search of the fabled Vault. After discovering the town of Fyrestone, the Vault Hunters begin to receive psychic instructions from a mysterious woman known as the \\"Guardian Angel\\". The Vault Hunters meet a CL4P-TP or \\"Claptrap\\" robot and a doctor named Zed who help them establish a reputation by killing several bandit leaders, eventually leading to the collection of an alien artifact, being the first piece of a key needed to open the Vault. This causes Patricia Tannis, Dahl's former archaeologist still in residence on the planet, to contact the Vault Hunters, revealing that the Vault can only be accessed once every 200 years and that the time of the next opening is approaching. Tannis also explains that three more artifacts are needed to complete the Vault Key. Meanwhile, Commandant Steele of the Crimson Lance (a well-outfitted military force led by the Atlas Corporation) threatens to declare martial law and demands the Vault Key pieces. The Vault Hunters secure the second and third pieces by following Tannis' instructions, but the final piece, supposedly in the possession of a bandit lord named Baron Flynt, turns out not to be where it was expected. Steele contacts the Vault Hunters to reveal that there are in fact only three pieces and that Tannis has betrayed and misled them. Steele then disables the planet's ECHO network, preventing further communication with the Guardian Angel and anyone else. The Vault Hunters infiltrate the Crimson Lance's headquarters and find Tannis imprisoned. She claims she was forced into betrayal and urges the Vault Hunters to restart the ECHO network and stop Steele and the Crimson Lance before they reach the Vault. After restoring the network, the Guardian Angel directs the Vault Hunters toward Steele's location. During the final approach to the Vault, the Vault Hunters encounter Crimson Lance forces already locked in combat with the Vault's alien Guardians. The Vault Hunters finally arrive at the Vault only moments too late to stop Steele from using the Key. When the Vault opens, a giant monster emerges and wipes out Steele and the rest of her troops. The Guardian Angel explains that the monster is called the \\"Destroyer\\" and was imprisoned in the Vault long ago by the Eridians, the alien race who left behind the ruins and created the Vault, in order to prevent the destruction of the universe, and that the Guardians were posted to prevent anyone from opening it. Although the Vault Hunters kill the Destroyer, the Vault is re-sealed for another 200 years. The Guardian Angel is revealed to be transmitting her signals through a Hyperion satellite in orbit high above Pandora. The game ends with the satellite sending a signal to a Claptrap robot on the planet, changing it into an \\"Interplanetary Ninja Assassin\\" (continued in the plot of the DLC Claptrap's New Robot Revolution). Development Gearbox's Randy Pitchford said that the idea of Borderlands was inspired both being an avid role-playing game (RPG) fan, including roguelikes such as NetHack and action role-playing games like Ultima and Diablo, and being drawn into first-person shooters (FPS) that he worked on in his early career, including Duke Nukem 3D. He recognized that the core gameplay loops for both genres are at different time scales; whereas the core loop for a role-playing game is long in terms of leveling up characters, a shooter has a much shorter one in moving and shooting to clear out a new area. Pitchford felt these two loops were not mutually exclusive due to the different time scales, and believed some type of fusion could be made from the two genres, thus forming the basis of Borderlands. Pitchford recognized this could be a risk but was not afraid to take it: in a 2017 interview, Pitchford recounted that industry analyst Michael Pachter had believed Borderlands was going to be a failure, as players that would want to play a role-playing game or a shooter would more than likely play a game dedicated to that genre instead of the hybrid. After the Borderlands series had sold more than 30 million copies, Pachter admitted to Pitchford how wrong he had been. Gearbox did not have the narrative defined at the onset of development for Borderlands, but needed to find some reason to have the player feel rewarded about killing enemies and collecting loot from them. As they developed the game further, they came to the idea of casting the player as a \\"vault hunter\\", so that looting equipment and other items would be \\"kind of virtuous\\". This led to the Pandora narrative, since the act of opening a vault or box to obtain potentially disastrous results was compared to the mythological Pandora's box. The game's development started around 2005, internally pitched as Halo meets Diablo\\". The initial period involved Pitchford selling his team on the idea of the FPS-RPG hybrid, and eventually determining that the FPS genre would be the defining genre for the game. The game's art style was initially more realistic, with visual ideas inspired partially by the Gears of War and Mass Effect series. The team expanded and prepared for releasing the game's first public reveal in September 2007 via a Game Informer cover story, with trailers to be shown in the follow year's E3 and other game conventions, building atop a modified Unreal Engine 3. Elements that were planned at the time of that cover story but that did not make the final game included procedurally generated \\"loot caves\\", and the ability to hire non-playable character mercenaries to help in combat. Further, the game initially had three Vault hunters; Brick had not been included yet, as Gearbox thought that it would be interesting in the co-op to have two or more players playing the same characters but with persistent improvements that the players had made to them. Internal teams, assembled to give Gearbox's projects a critical review, started cautioning the team that at this stage, as they felt Borderlands was begin to look much closer to the then-recent Fallout 3 or Rage games. The realistic look, which gave much of the visuals a brown, muted color palette, clashed with some of the more fantastical elements they had included at that point, such as extraordinary jump heights and the vehicle systems. By this point, the game was 75% complete and there was a target release window they wanted to reach, so scrapping major elements of the game was not an option for the studio. According to chief creative officer Brian Martel, they opted to try to find their \\"purple cow\\", some visual element that would make the game stand out and gain sales. Martel and a small team spent some time in secret to create prototype of the game using an art style similar to cel shading, fearing that if they had said anything to the other team members, there may have been discontentment among the staff. Pitchford would later acknowledge that this new style was not wholly original to Gearbox and was partially inspired by Ben Hibon's short film Codehunters. Hibon has stated that while he was contacted by Gearbox to possibly work on artwork for Borderlands, nothing ever came of the talks. The style itself appears as cel- shaded comic book artwork, but is rendered using a combination of hand-drawn textures with engine modifications to outline major features, creating the comic book appearance. When the new style was revealed to both Gearbox and 2K Games, nearly everyone was pleased with it. However, the game's original art director was so disappointed with having her work discarded that she left the company and the video game industry all together. The style was refined further with the help of a comic book artist. Most of the rest of the elements of the game, such as the type and variety of enemies, were kept as is; the skill trees, initially filled with more mundane abilities, were repopulated with applies inspired by magic systems from RPGs, such as healing bullets, embracing the more extreme aspects of the game. Other shortcuts were taken to complete the game in a timely manner such as reusing systems from other Gearbox games, and adjusting the narrative and setting to simplify the end product, such as having Pandora's moon in a fixed location in order so they could create dramatic shadows for the various levels. The change did still delay their initially planned release in 2008 into 2009, with Gearbox showing off the new style by May of that year. Note that the original title read: Borderlands decides on cel shaded art style Marketing and release=Retail versions Borderlands was released in three separate versions: *The Standard Edition includes the game disc and instruction manual. *The retail downloadable content packs which includes the first two episodes of Borderlands downloadable content: The Zombie Island of Doctor Ned and Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot was released on February 23, 2010, in North America. *The first Game of the Year Edition, released on October 12, 2010, in North America, included the original Borderlands game, one-time use vouchers for all four of the downloadable content packs, and a hand drawn bonus map. Players who bought this edition gained access to the Duke Nukem Forever First Access Club, granting them exclusive items, including early access to the Duke Nukem Forever playable demo before it was publicly released. The second Game of the Year version included all 4 of the DLCs on a second disc on Xbox 360, and on the same disc on PlayStation 3. Downloadable contentThe Zombie Island of Dr. Ned= The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is the first installment of downloadable content (DLC) for Borderlands and includes new quests, items, and enemies‚Äîincluding WereSkags and various zombies. The storyline takes place in an area known as Jakobs Cove which is a small town built by the Jakobs Corporation. Dr. Ned had been in charge of keeping the workers of Jakobs Cove alive, but ended up transforming them into zombies. The main plot revolves around finding previous visitors to Jakobs Cove and investigating Dr. Ned himself after the Jakobs Corporation become suspicious of his work. The playable area includes a large outdoor map with several further areas branched from the main zone‚Äîincluding a dark, abandoned version of previous area 'Old Haven'. The installment was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions on November 24, 2009, which was celebrated with a trailer. The PC version was released via Steam with SecuROM on December 9, 2009. =Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot= Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot is the second piece of DLC for Borderlands. It features three new riot arenas (Hellburbia, the Gully, and Angelic Ruins) and storage for players' items. The plot of the DLC is Moxxi, a crazed lover who is setting out to find her 4th husband, leading her to make the arenas in the DLC. Players fight several of the game's enemies, including bosses, in arenas. No experience is gained from killing enemies in the arena battles, but experience can be gained from completing challenges or quests in the arena. New game modes are added, such as low gravity fighting, enemy health regeneration, and shieldless fighting. It was released on December 29, 2009, for the Xbox 360 and was released January 7, 2010, for the PlayStation 3 and PC. =The Secret Armory of General Knoxx= The Secret Armory of General Knoxx was unofficially announced on January 21, 2010, via the official Gearbox forums, posted by Gearbox level designer Jason Reiss saying the pack will increase the level cap to level 61, and is \\"the biggest DLC we have made\\". A tweet by Gearbox creative director Mike Neumann on January 21, 2010, said the pack would also include \\"more Scooter\\", who is a character in the game. This was followed by an official announcement from Gearbox via Gearboxity on January 29, 2010, confirming the release, level cap increase, brand new weapons, and \\"brutal, never-before-seen enemies in a huge new environment complete with tons of brand new missions\\" according to Gearbox, developer of the game. The plot of this DLC revolves around Athena, a rogue agent for Atlas who is self-described as the best, a woman sick of Atlas' lies who wants to bring them to their knees, and General Knoxx (Steele's superior), a man with extreme loathing for his job to the point of literally hating his life, who is tasked to destroy Athena and the protagonist(s). Along the way you also run into Moxxi who aids the player in taking on Atlas as well (if you help her face down her ex-husband) and Scooter, who reveals he is related to Moxxi. The DLC package became available February 23 for Xbox 360, and February 25 for PlayStation 3 and PC. =Claptrap's New Robot Revolution= On March 3, 2010, 2K officially announced a fourth piece of downloadable content, stating that they will \\"continue to support the title with more add-on content, and our approach to digital content for Borderlands gives [Take-Two] a road map for other titles going forward.\\" On July 15, 2010, General Knoxx's Twitter page was updated for the first time in months, stating that he had \\"new orders (sent from the future)\\" On July 30, 2010, Randy Pitchford, Co-founder of Gearbox Software and current CEO, announced via Twitter regarding the content \\"I get a LOT of questions about more DLC for Borderlands. Yes, more is coming! T2 already said so! Let's talk soon :)\\" On August 5, 2010, a long list of content that was supposedly going to be included in the content was posted on the Gearbox Forums by forum user Legendrew. The data was gathered from files in the 1.31 update for the PC version of Borderlands. On August 11, 2010, 2K confirmed the title of the content, Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, and its main premise. The DLC has 21 missions (split between 9 main missions and 12 side quests), 2 new skill points, and six additional backpack slots. The game focuses around a rogue army of brainwashed Claptraps (led by CL4P-TP, Interplanetary Ninja Assassin, the same Claptrap that is seen getting struck by lightning just after the end credits of the main game) who plan to destroy humanity for their mistreatment, along with an army of familiar enemies transformed into Claptrap styles (i.e., Crab-Traps, Rakk-Traps, and Skag-Traps). A wide variety of old cast members return alongside new faces. New fast-travel destinations were also expected, a first for Borderlands DLC, but ultimately they were not included. On September 5, 2010, Pitchford announced at the Penny Arcade Expo that the release date was scheduled to be September 28, 2010. Pitchford also announced a free patch to increase the level cap by 8 for all players (to a maximum of Level 69, or 58 for those without Knoxx's Armory), regardless of whether the expansion had been purchased.  Game of the Year Enhanced Edition  In conjunction with the announcement of Borderlands 3 in March 2019, Gearbox announced a Game of the Year Enhanced edition of Borderlands co- developed by Blind Squirrel Games, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows (as a free patch to the existing version of the game on Steam). In addition to 4K resolution textures and HDR support, the enhanced version backported improvements from Borderlands 2‚Äîsuch as replacing the compass display with a minimap, additional character customization options, and four-player split- screen multiplayer on console, as well as changes to the game's final boss fight.  Nintendo Switch port  On March 26, 2020, Gearbox announced that the first three Borderlands games would be released for Nintendo Switch as part of Borderlands Legendary Collection on May 29, 2020. Reception Borderlands received positive reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version 84/100, the PlayStation 3 version 83/100, and the PC version 81/100. In late 2011, Borderlands was named 35th on IGN's Top 100 Modern Video Games list. Jeff Gerstmann from Giant Bomb gave Borderlands 4 stars out of 5, called it a successful loot-driven first-person shooter \\"where plenty of other Diablo-inspired games have failed miserably\\", but criticized the \\"paper-thin story\\" and the predictable AI. Charles Onyett from IGN awarded Borderlands an 8.8/10 and an Editor's Choice Award. He noted that fans of RPGs would enjoy the streamlined item management, and treasure hunting, but criticized the lack of character skills. With \\"beautiful visuals, tried and true RPG mechanics, and solid first-person-shooter gameplay\\", Onyett felt that the game was very enjoyable. RPGLand's Ivan Taran gave it a rating of \\"Great\\" and the game went on to win the site's Xbox 360 Game of the Year award, and be named the Runner-up for overall Game of the Year 2009, losing out to Demon's Souls. Sales In late August 2009, Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse Divnich said \\"Borderlands could very well surprise the market and consumers as BioShock did in 2007.\\" By December 2009, the game had sold over 2 million copies according to Take-Two Interactive's financial report. By February 2010, the number had risen to 3 million. By August 2011, the game had sold 4.5 million units worldwide. The game's commercial success was enough to turn the Borderlands intellectual property into a large gaming franchise with numerous mainline sequels and even a spin-off game. Sequels A sequel, Borderlands 2, was announced on August 2, 2011 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows platforms. The game was also developed by Gearbox Software and distributed by Take-Two Interactive, and was released on September 18, 2012. The game features many technical improvements and follows four new Vault Hunters (six with the downloadable characters added later) on Pandora as they battle Handsome Jack and the Hyperion Corporation.

As described in the Book to the Great Chart of Muscovy (1627), the route went north from the Tatar fortress of Or Qapƒ± (Perekop), the gateway of the Crimean peninsula, east of the Dnieper to the Russian fortress of Tula, 193 km south of Moscow. To avoid major river crossings, the route followed the high ground between the basins of the Dnieper and Don, making an almost straight line from the Dnieper bend to Tula. It ran mostly through thinly populated tallgrass steppe country ('Murav√°' is an old Slavic word for prairie or grassland) avoiding forests, marshes and river crossings. Apart from the main route, there were number of branches and bypaths, of which the Kalmius Trail and the Izyum Trail were by far the most important. Between 1500 and 1550 there were 43 Tatars' raids using this trail. In the wake of the Russo-Crimean War (1571), it became increasingly clear that only a defense line south of the main zasechnaya cherta would put an end to annual incursions. Such a chain of eleven forts and obstructions, the \\"Belgorod Defense Line\\", was constructed at the behest of Boris Godunov, including, among other fortified settlements, the towns of Livny (1586), Voronezh (1586), Kursk (1587, rebuilt), Yelets (1592, rebuilt), Stary Oskol (1593), Valuyki (1593) and Belgorod (1596, rebuilt). After this, the Tatars began avoiding this route. It later became a main route used by the Cossacks to raid the Crimea. Tactics The Tatars preferred to invade at harvest time when forage was plentiful. Smaller raids were made in early winter when the rivers were frozen. Davies says that the journey to Moscow took 55 days. Larger raids were led by the Khan in person. The core of his force was a guard of 200-1000 musketeers with light artillery and supply carts that could be formed into a wagenburg. The main force consisted of horse archers with reflex bows and short stirrups. They also had sabers and lances and the richer ones might have chain mail, helmets or muskets. Each man took one or two spare horses. They carried few supplies, preferring to live off the land. The army traveled in columns. Beauplan estimated a column as 800 to 1,000 paces across and up to 10 leagues long. 'It was an amazing sight since 80,000 Tatars are accompanied by more than 200,000 horses'. On nearing enemy territory they camped for a few days and sent out scouts to be sure there were no significant forces in the area. After penetration they sent out two wings of up to 10,000 men each from the main body to sweep the country for 10 or 12 leagues around taking women, children, horses, sheep and cattle and those men who chose not to resist. When the wings returned to the main corps, other wings were sent out in the same manner. Having 'harvested' an area they withdrew by a different route. They did not waste time attacking fortified towns and avoided fighting organized forces unless they were forced to defend themselves. The returning columns, laden with booty, were most vulnerable to counterattack. The need to guard and escort captives kept the ratio of captives to raiders to about 1:3. Davies, Brian L, Warfare, State and Society on the Black Sea Steppe, 2007, page 20 Individual Mirzas would lead smaller-scale raids with a few thousand men. They would send out scouts to look for enemy forces and capture prisoners for interrogation and then sweep through an area 10 to twelve leagues broad, rendezvousing at a pre-arranged point each night. If attacked they would split into bands of about 100 men (\\"chambuly\\") and scatter in all directions, reuniting later. Route According to Davies, Davies, Brian L, Warfare, State and Society on the Black Sea Steppe, 2007, Map 1 and page 18 (his account seems to contradict itself in a few places. Routes would have varied and there are probably few documents) the trail started at Perekop (about 1100 km south of Moscow) and ran northeast parallel to the Sea of Azov coast about two thirds of the way and then swung north along the watershed between the basins of the Dnieper River and Donets. There it spread into branches through what later became the Sloboda Ukraine, the branches rejoining at Stary Oskol (618 km south of Moscow) and Livny (about 375 km south of Moscow). From Livny it went directly north to Tula and crossed the Oka River at Serpukhov almost directly south of Moscow. In the spread out section there were three branches. The western branch was the Muravsky proper which ran northwest to about Valki and then northeast west of Belgorod to Livny. The center or Izyumsky Trail seems to have run directly north along the south- flowing part of the Donets and joined the Muravsky at Stary Oskol. The eastern or Kalmius branch ran east of the Donets and joined the others south of Livny. East of these was a route used by the Lesser Nogai Horde which ran from Azov to Livny. The Nogai Road proper was much farther east and ran from near Stalingrad through Kozlov to the Oka at Ryazan. He also mentions three trails running northwest from Perekop to Galicia. The Czarny Trail went north toward Kyiv with a branch at the latitude of Cherkasy going west to Galicia. The Kuczman Trail followed the south bank of the Bug and the Wolsky Trail followed the shore of the Black Sea and then the Dniester River.

The Sleipner gas field is a natural gas field in the block 15/9 of the North Sea, about west of Stavanger, Norway. Two parts of the field are in production, Sleipner West (proven in 1974), and Sleipner East (1981). The field produces natural gas and light oil condensates from sandstone structures about below sea level. It is operated by Equinor. The field is named after the steed Sleipnir in Norse mythology. Reserves and production As of the end of 2005, the estimated recoverable reserves for the Sleipner West and East fields were 51.6 billion cubic metres of natural gas, of natural gas liquids, and 3.9 million cubic metres of condensates. Daily production of the field in 2008 was oil equivalents per day , 36 million cubic metres of natural gas per day, and 14,000 cubic metres of condensate per day. In an updated 2017 report, the Norway Petroleum Directorate estimates 2.72 million cubic meters of oil, 11.72 billion cubic meters of natural gas, 0.67 million tons of natural gas liquids, and 0.07 million cubic meters of condensates remain in the reserves. Sleipner field consists of four platforms. The field is planted with 18 production wells. The Sleipner A platform is located on the Sleipner East and the Sleipner B platform is located on the Sleipner West. Sleipner B is operated remotely from the Sleipner A via an umbilical cable. The Sleipner T carbon dioxide treatment platform is linked physically to the Sleipner A platform by a bridge and to the Sleipner B wellhead platform by carbon dioxide flow line. The Sleipner Riser platform, serving the Langeled and Zeepipe pipelines, is located on the Sleipner East field. Carbon capture and storage project The Sleipner Vest (West) field is used as a facility for carbon capture and storage (CCS). It is the world's first offshore CCS plant, operative since September 15, 1996. The project, in the initial year, proved insecure due to sinking top sand. However, after a re-perforation and an installation of a gravel layer in August 1997, CCS operations were secure. As of 2018, one million tonnes of have been transported and injected into the formation yearly since 1996. The project summary reports a capacity of up to 600 billion tonnes ( ~660 billion tons). The Sleipner West field has up to 9% concentration; Norway only allows 2.5% before imposing production export quality penalties, which may have been NOK 1 million/day ( ~$120,000US/ day). Operating costs are $17US/ ton injected, however, the company does not pay Norway's carbon tax of 1991 and receives carbon credit in the EU's emissions trading system. Before the carbon tax, industries released poor quality into the atmosphere. In a business-as-usual scenario, Norway's emissions would have had a total increase of 3% over 20 years if not for the CCS experiment. Carbon dioxide is treated on the Sleipner T treatment platform. After that carbon dioxide is transported to the Sleipner A platform where it is injected into the Utsira formation through a dedicated well ca. 1000 meters under the seabed. Using Time-lapse Gravity and Seismic methods, the pioneering Sleipner carbon capture project confirmed the technological viability of injecting and measuring in an offshore reservoir, as well as the effectiveness of mitigating emissions through stable storage. To avoid possible leakages that can result in health hazards and environmental destruction, above the Utsira Formation injection site lies 30 seafloor gravity stations for monitoring under the title, Saline Aquifer Storage. These sites monitor microseismic activity along with gravitational forces and depth metrics. Seafloor height, natural gas production, and tidal shifts determine the gravity measured. Explicitly regulated under Norway's Petroleum law in December 2014 and in line with the EU's 2009/31/EC directive, monitoring objectives focus on assessing gas movement, shell stability, and the effectiveness of remedy scenarios in case of leakage. From 2002 to 2005, measurements identified vertical changes in established metric boundaries, most likely attributed to erosion and marine life. Onsite geochemical and reservoir simulations reveal a main buildup of under the formation's cap seal. However, when the injections are eventually decommissioned, simulations show accumulation proximate to the cap seal in clay layers saturated with sand, which will result in solubility trapping. This solubility trapping, caused by the multiple layers of clay and sand, prevents from rising beyond and will ultimately turn to mineral trapping in the substrate. Furthermore, groundwater flow facilitates better distribution of gases and depressurization, lowering the risk of leakage. The composition reaction of the mixture of clay, sand, and carbon is the determining factor of long-term stability in the Sleipner CCS project. As of 2007, measurements from the gravity stations revealed that the injection of into the Utsira Formation has not resulted in any noticeable seismic activity and that there have been no carbon dioxide leakages in the past 10 years. Natural gas pipelines' operator Gassco had proposed to build a carbon dioxide pipeline from K√•rst√∏ to transport carbon dioxide from the now decommissioned K√•rst√∏ power station. While injection pipelines do not succumb to rusting when transporting , transport pipelines experience low temperatures and high pressures, resulting in dew formation, and subsequently, rust.  Miocene utsira formation  The Miocene Utsira Formation is a large aquifer with a stable, layered clay seal. Distributed through multiple phases as a result of sea-level variations caused by glacial events in the Pliocene period, deposits date back to the late Miocene/ early Pliocene to early Pleistocene times, determined by palynology. Upper Pliocene deltaic sand deposits blanket the formation with the highest top sands located roughly 150 meters below sea level. Measured with 3D seismic data, the Utsira sandstone lies underneath 800‚Äì1000 meters of sediment under the sea with a maximum thickness of over 300 meters. The Utsira stretches 450 kilometers North to South and 90 kilometers East to West. In the North and South lie deep sand systems, while in the middle region slimmer deposits cover the seafloor. The Tampen area, located in the most Northern region, contains lean deposits of glauconitic sand.

During World War II, Klute worked for Chrysler developing the first American jet-powered fighter planes. Later, he was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project and the development of the first atomic bomb in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. During the early 1960s, Klute was in charge of the combustion research at Rocketdyne Corporation during the development of the Saturn F-1 rocket engine. Testing of the engine had revealed a serious instability problem during combustion that would sometimes cause catastrophic failure. In October, 1962, Dr. Klute presided over the Combustion Stability Committee at the Liquid Propulsion Division at Rocketdyne. His contributions were instrumental in solving the combustion instability problem. The crater Klute on the Moon was named after him in 1970 by the International Astronomical Union. Dr. Klute's experience at Rocketdyne included analyses and analytical design studies for nearly all Rocketdyne engines, both liquid and solid. He was responsible for structural analysis and integrity of many Rocketdyne engines and their components. His analyses of control systems resulted in the advancement in the design of Rocketdyne products. In the last four years of his life, he had been associated with the combustion devices and combustion processes of the liquid rocket engines. He was especially influential in the design and development of the J-2 and F-1 combustion components. From October 1962, until his death, he had been responsible for the direction of the F-1 stability program. In this capacity he gained national recognition and prominence as one of the nation's outstanding scientists. During this assignment he worked closely with Government specialists, University professors, and consultants regarding the fundamentals of combustion stability. He was recognized by NASA as an individual who made outstanding contributions to this field. In 1945, Klute married Frances Kramer in Detroit, Michigan. Kramer worked testing aircraft engines in the Chrysler Factory. Together, they had nine children; Michael, Mary, Daniel, David, Margaret, Martha, Elizabeth, Steven, and Helen.

He was tried for war crimes committed at M√ºhldorf, was found guilty and executed on the gallows at Landsberg Prison in 1951 M√ºhldorf was a satellite system of the Dachau concentration camp located near M√ºhldorf in Bavaria, established in mid-1944 and run by the Schutzstaffel (SS). The camps were established to provide labor for an underground installation for the production of the Messerschmitt 262 (Me-262), a jet fighter designed to challenge Allied air superiority over Germany. Operation Between July 1944 and April 1945, when the U.S. Army overran the area, more than 8,000 prisoners had been deported to the main camp at Mettenheim and to its subcamps. As the Allied air offensive against Nazi Germany intensified after 1943, the Nazi leadership decided to construct underground installations in order to produce weaponry and related war material. Accelerated construction of such facilities required significant outlay of human resources. The SS provided concentration camp prisoners to carry out the most dangerous tasks, such as hollowing out tunnels from mountainsides and caves, constructing subterranean factories, and hauling construction materials. To facilitate these immense projects, it set up hundreds of satellite camps close to proposed industrial sites in 1944 and 1945. According to the account of a prisoner who turned over the camp's administrative files to American authorities, the Mettenheim camp held some 2,000 inmates, a nearby women's camp 500 persons, the \\"forest camps\\" (Waldlager) about 2,250 male and female inmates, while two other camps held a total of 550 persons. Most of the prisoners were Hungarian Jews, but there were also Jews from Greece, France, Italy as well as political prisoners from Russia, Poland and Serbia. The surrounding area also contained numerous forced-labor and prisoner-of-war camps to supply workers for the factory. Conditions at the M√ºhldorf complex were dismal. As at the Kaufering camps, the SS guards carried out \\"selections\\" at the M√ºhldorf complex in the fall of 1944, deporting hundreds of sick and disabled inmates to the gas chambers at Auschwitz. It is estimated that more than half of the prisoners held there perished following their deportation to the Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center or died on site from overwork, abuse, shootings, and disease. Prisoners in the \\"forest camps V and VI\\" (Waldlager V and VI), located near the town of Ampfing, were housed in earthen huts, barracks partially submerged in the ground with soil-covered roofs designed to camouflage the structures from Allied aerial reconnaissance. Prisoners frequently worked 10- to 12-hour days hauling heavy bags of cement and carrying out other arduous construction tasks. In late April, as the U.S. Army approached the camps, the SS guards evacuated some 3,600 prisoners from the camp on death marches. War crimes trial In February 1946, the US Military Tribunal at Dachau indicted fourteen Nazi officials of the M√ºhldorf camp for crimes committed against the unarmed prisoners, including killings, beatings, torture, starvation and abuse. On May 13, 1947, thirteen of the defendants were found guilty, six were sentenced to death by hanging, two to life imprisonment, and the remainder to sentences varying from 10 to twenty years; one was acquitted.

He received his ordination as rabbi from Solomon Kluger, Zvi Hirsch Chajes, and Dob Berush Meisels, the last named of whom was rabbi of Cracow until 1854. Dembitzer sided nevertheless with Meisel's rival, Saul Landau, in the quarrel about the rabbinate of Cracow. In 1856 Dembitzer became a dayyan in his native city, and was, like his older brother Jacob, advanced to the position of rosh Beth din, which he held till his death. In 1874 he visited Germany and made the acquaintance of Leopold Zunz and other Jewish scholars, with whom he corresponded on historical subjects. Works Dembitzer's earlier works were all on halakic subjects, on which he was a recognized authority. His \\"Maginne Eretz Yisrael\\" (responsa, Lemberg, 1852); \\"Dibre Hen,\\" which appeared as a supplement to Solomon Kluger's \\"Abodat ha-Kodesh\\" (Zolkiev, 1863); and \\"Liwyat Hen\\" (Cracow, 1882) belong to that class. But the last-named, a critical commentary on the work \\"RABYH\\" of Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi, which Dembitzer published from a manuscript, contains much valuable material for the history of the Tosafists, which is interspersed among the pilpulistic arguments of the main subject. His chief historical work, \\"Kelilat Yofi,\\" of which the first part, containing biographies of the rabbis of Lemberg and of other Polish communities, appeared in 1888, and the second part, also biographical and historical, in 1893 (Cracow), is an important contribution to the science of Judaism. He is also the author of \\"Michtave Bikoret,\\" a valuable correspondence with the historian Heinrich Graetz about the Council of Four Lands (\\"Otzar ha-Sifrut,\\" iv. 193-243; also published separately, Cracow, 1892), and of a biography of the Tosafist Joseph Porat, which appeared posthumously in \\"Ha-Hoker,\\" ii. 48-59. The \\"Mappelet Ir ha-Tzedek\\" (1878), a severe and vindictive criticism of J. M. Zunz's \\"Ir ha-Tzedek\\" on the rabbis of Cracow, was likewise written by him, although the name of Joel Dembitzer, his younger brother, appears on the title-page as the nominal author.

He is also sometimes known by the patronymic Idris ap Gwyddno (Idris son of Gwyddno). Although now known as Idris Gawr, (Idris the Giant) this may be an error and he may have originally been known as \\"Idris Arw\\" (Idris the Coarse). He was apparently so large that he could sit on the summit of Cadair Idris and survey his whole kingdom. Cadair Idris, a Welsh mountain, literally means \\"Chair of Idris\\". Idris was said to have studied the stars from on top of it and it was later reputed to bestow either madness or poetic inspiration on whoever spent a night on its summit. According to John Rhys, there were three other giants in the Welsh tradition along with Idris; these were Ysgydion, Offrwm, and Ysbryn and each of them is said to have a mountain named after him somewhere in the vicinity of Cadair Idris. Another story has Idris seated in his chair plucking irritating grit from his shoe and throwing it down to the valley below, where it formed the three large boulders seen there till this day. The historical Idris is thought to have been killed during a battle with Oswald of Northumbria near the River Severn around 632, although the Welsh annals merely state he was strangled in the same year. He may have retired to the mountain as a hermit, but if that was the case, he must have re-entered secular life to do battle. His grave, Gwely Idris, is said to be somewhere up on the mountain. However he died, he seems to have been succeeded by his son Sualda.

He is a blue-haired average student at Hikarizaka high school. He has been labeled as a delinquent, a young person who defies authority. Despite his bad temper and reputation as a delinquent, he mainly turns up to school late and skips classes, but does not go around provoking fights. He is the type of person who thinks deep thoughts about his life, but usually does not voice them out. The source of his delinquency: ever since his mother, Atsuko, died in a car crash when he was young, Tomoya has been living with his father, Naoyuki, whom he argues with constantly, Tomoya was injured during a fight with his father three years ago; since then, he could no longer raise his right shoulder, thus his basketball career ended. After that incident Tomoya's relationship with his father has been very distant. Despite Tomoya's sarcastic ways he has a knack for solving the problems of his friends, and seems to care for all of them deeply even if he does not want to admit it. He is a childhood friend of Kotomi Ichinose and is best friends with Youhei Sunohara. While walking to school, Tomoya's life changes for the better when meeting a girl named Nagisa Furukawa. Nagisa describes him as someone who is seemingly mean and bad-mouthed, but is actually kind-hearted. :In the After Story, Tomoya helps settle a lot of people's problems. His love and protectiveness of Nagisa grows stronger to the point he eventually marries her after both of them graduate and he gets a job as an electrician, thanks to Yusuke. Afterwards Nagisa becomes pregnant with Ushio. During those months, Tomoya takes care of Nagisa as she grows ill, and once Ushio is born, Nagisa passes away. Afterwards, Tomoya goes into a five- year depression, and barely interacts with his daughter, who is left in the care of Akio and Sanae. Later he takes her on a trip to the field of flowers, where they meet Tomoya's grandmother, who tells Tomoya about his father's struggles after his wife died. Tomoya realizes that he's putting Ushio through the same kind of relationship he and his father had, and soon becomes a better father. Returning home, his father accepts and claims that his role as a father is over. A short time later, however, Ushio is struck with the same illness that took the life of her mother, and Tomoya takes it upon himself to remain with her until the illness subsides. Months later, winter approaches, and Tomoya is still looking after the sick Ushio, who requests to take a trip that they'd once taken before. It begins to snow, Ushio collapses, as he holds Ushio, her last breath being, \\"Daddy I love you\\", Tomoya's daughter dies in his arms, and as he succumbs to the pain and grief of losing both Nagisa and Ushio, he falls into the snow. After the event in which Ushio is revealed to be the Girl in the Illusionary World, Tomoya, in possession of enough light orbs to turn back the hands of time, is taken back to when he first met Nagisa, in the knowledge that he can change things, and that Nagisa is all he ever wanted, and tightly embraces her. Tomoya returns to the day that Nagisa is in labor, Ushio is born, but this time, Nagisa survives, as does Ushio, who never suffers the illness her mother had. Tomoya lives with his daughter and wife as a peaceful family. ; : :Nagisa is the main heroine. She is an auburn- haired girl who is gentle and uses a nonconfrontational style of speech. Nagisa speaks very politely and is sensitive, easily hurt and insulted. Her birthday is December 24. She loudly shouts the names of food that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as anpan, a type of sweet bean bread. She admires an outdated group mascot known as and explains that she likes the fact that they are a close family, regardless of the situation. Due to an illness which lasted nine months, she was forced to repeat her final year; as such, she is a year older than her classmates, including Tomoya. Nagisa nearly died as a child due to her parents' preoccupation with their careers since she has periodically suffered long bouts of illness since the age of five. Nagisa's life was spared, however, after Akio begged for her to become healthy again. Ever since, Akio and Sanae abandoned their dreams, and open a bakery, to watch over Nagisa's health. One day, Nagisa appeared muttering to herself on the foot of the hill and met Tomoya as he walks the path leading to the school. Despite not having many friends, Nagisa is a caring person. She would not hesitate to assist a stranger. As a result, Tomoya criticizes her at times for being naive; nevertheless, she is always kind to him and cares about him a lot. Nagisa's wish of reviving the school's drama club is the priority of Tomoya's efforts, even with the encounters with the other heroines. When Nagisa reaches her goal, she shows a considerable amount of growth since she met Tomoya. The following day, Tomoya confesses his love to Nagisa. She accepts it and the two begin their relationship as a couple. :In the After Story, she succumbs to her illness that she has to repeat her third-year yet again. She tries to reestablish the drama club once again; however, she fails not having encouragement from Tomoya while he was a student. She manages to continue attending school every day, and dons a brave smile throughout the year. When Tomoya leaves the bakery to move into his own apartment, Nagisa visits him almost every day and cooks meals for him, keeping him company. When winter comes, her illness forces her absence at the graduation ceremony; Tomoya organizes a mock ceremony for her in graduation. Soon after, she and Tomoya marry. After the marriage, she is now known as . Along with Rie and Sugisaka, Nagisa begins as a waitress at a family restaurant. Eventually, Nagisa becomes pregnant, and she and Tomoya decide to name their child Ushio, Nagisa enters her final months of pregnancy, and successfully gives birth to her daughter, Ushio; however, she dies shortly after childbirth. :Both Nagisa and Ushio are eventually resurrected, when Tomoya wishes for a miracle to turn back time. Despite deciding to avoid his first meeting with Nagisa, in order to change their fate, he finds he cannot let Nagisa go. By calling out to her again, he proves he doesn't regret meeting her, and the delivery goes well, allowing both Nagisa and Ushio to survive. ; : :Kyou is another heroine that plays a supporting role in the adaptations. Kyou is the older one of the purple-haired Fujibayashi twins and has long hair with her hairpiece to the left. She assumed the role of class representative of her class, but generally does not consider it very important. An exception to this is when she hides the fact that she commutes to school on a scooter, which is prohibited by the school. She is an energetic and outgoing girl who can sometimes be overprotective of her sister. Despite her Tsundere personality she is a surprisingly good cook. She met Tomoya some time in their second year, explaining their friendship. Her strength is great, with Tomoya once comparing it to Tomoyo's kicks. Her books are thrown with enough force to crack concrete. Kyou becomes a member of the drama club, although she only signs up so the minimum number of members will be reached. While working so that Ryou and Tomoya becomes a couple, Kyou falls in love with Tomoya too. However, after seeing Tomoya helping Nagisa when she got injured, the two sisters hugged and cried as they came to grips with reality that Tomoya is already in love with Nagisa. :Later in After Story, Kyou works as a kindergarten teacher, and coincidentally is also Ushio's teacher. According to Tomoya, her personality is still the same even after reunion, but Ushio says that Kyou is a good teacher. She misses Nagisa and is often reminded of her each time she sees Ushio. :Kyou's story starts when she tries to make Tomoya get intimately close with Ryou. However, when a rumor about Tomoya being a two timer with Ryou and Kyou spreads around the school, Kyou starts avoiding Tomoya, and Ryou becomes bolder. After much conflict of playing boyfriend and girlfriend with Ryou, Tomoya breaks up with Ryou and confesses his love to Kyou, who in return confesses her love to him and they become a couple. Kyou also appeared in the movie adaptation, as a member of the school council and assistant to Tomoyo with a close relationship. ; : :Kotomi is a childhood friend of Tomoya, but, like Kyou, she is in the same year and in a separate class from Tomoya. She is a blue-haired studious girl who is in the top ten for every subject throughout the whole country in standardized exam results‚Äîshe always goes to the library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a quiet girl and it is quite difficult to communicate with her. In her spare time, she plays the violin, although she is very poor at it to the point of causing pain to those who hear her play as a comedic effect. :Tomoya meets her, but does not remember that they were once good friends, when he enters the library and finds Kotomi sitting on the floor barefoot, reading books with scissors in her hand, and acts oddly with Tomoya. After several meetings with Kotomi, Tomoya starts skipping the fourth period to spend time with Kotomi in the library. Kotomi soon decides to join the Drama Club. :Just when Kotomi starts to open up to everyone, a bus crash causes her to break down in front of everyone and returns home. Tomoya visits her in her house and learns that he and Kotomi were childhood friends, but lost contact with each other after Kotomi's parents died in a plane crash. Not wanting to feel the pain of losing someone important anymore, she asks Tomoya to leave her alone. Wanting to bring Kotomi away from her past, Tomoya decides to renovate her garden, while the drama club members decide to gift her a violin, but was unfortunately destroyed. After renovating Kotomi's garden, Kotomi appears to Tomoya, and after some poignant conversation, Tomoya brings Kotomi out of her house to see the outside world inside her heart. Along the conversations, she confesses to Tomoya that she had been in love with him ever since he has entered her life. The next day, her guardian presents Kotomi her parents' briefcase that has traveled all the way to Japan, and inside is a teddy bear and a testimony, asking Kotomi to live the way she wants and grow up to be an adult. Kotomi realizes she is still being loved by her parents even after their death and cries. After this, Kotomi becomes happy, and the drama club members finally give Kotomi a violin for her birthday. :In the anime adaptation Clannad After Story, Kotomi moves to America to further her studies about the illusionary world. She, however, occasionally visits Tomoya and the others. Kotomi also appeared in the movie adaptation, only being a background character as she is only seen conducting a song for the members of the Choir Club. ; :, Ry≈çko Tanaka (Tomoyo After) :Tomoyo transferred to Hikarizaka high school as a second year student during spring. She is a silver-haired strong-silent type girl who is known to be very strong. Although Tomoya is older than she is, Tomoyo does not show him his due respect as a senior student. She has a younger brother named . :In Tomoyo's path, she is rumored to be violent and to have a misconduct record for fighting. These rumors are later confirmed, when she beats up several delinquents from her previous school at a day during school hours. Youhei challenges Tomoyo, unable to believe what he saw. Tomoyo usually uses chain combos with her high-speed kicks, even combining with Tomoya once. Youhei's face is usually hidden after the beating, implying it to be too damaged to be shown on screen. After several meetings with Tomoyo, Tomoya learns from her that she wants to be a student council president, and later, her reason for wanting to do so. Her reason is that she wants to get enough influence to start a movement to prevent a row of cherry blossom trees from being cut down by development plans, as they are considered significant by several residents of their city, and the cherry trees have a special meaning to her since they helped mend her broken Sakagami family and turn her away from delinquency. When rumours of her former delinquency continue to spread and threaten to derail her campaign to be student council president, Tomoya helps her out by arranging for her to challenge the various sports teams, all of which she manages to win, thus greatly increasing her popularity. This in turn allows her to win student council president. :She ends up secretly going out with Tomoya. News of her relationship with him spreads fast in school, and the teachers and fellow student council members try to separate the two in hopes that Tomoyo will concentrate more on her position as student council president and strive to achieve the greater heights they believe she is capable of. Tomoya, worrying about his delinquent status, reluctantly breaks up with her out of fear that he will hold her back. After several months, Tomoyo meets up with Tomoya once again, telling him that she successfully saved the cherry blossom trees from being cut down but she lost something in return: her time with him. She then confesses to him that she wants only him and will follow him to the odd ends. Tomoya is touched by her words and they both decide to resume being lovers. After Tomoya graduates in spring, he sees both Takafumi and Tomoyo off to school, with both of them admiring the beauty of the cherry blossom. Tomoyo's story continues in Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life, Key's fifth game and spin-off sequel to Clannad, with her as the main heroine. :In the movie, Tomoyo is also running for student council president, but apparently gets the position much faster and she doesn't interact with Tomoya very much, though she is shown to become close with him and his friends and her relationships with Kyou and Youhei are better compared to the game and anime. She and Youhei show up at Tomoya's apartment during his bout of depression after Nagisa's death in an attempt to try cheering him up. ; : :Fuko is a first year student at Hikarizaka high school. Her birthday is in July. She is a strange girl who is always alone, making wood carvings of starfish with a small knife to give to others as presents. This hobby occupies her completely to the point that she sometimes loses awareness of her surroundings. Tomoya meets Fuko in an empty classroom, carving a block of wood with a knife. Tomoya confiscates the knife after noticing she is hurting herself, but returns the knife the next day. Some days later, Tomoya learns from Fuko that she is carving 700 starfish to be distributed to all the students in the school, wanting them to attend her sister Kouko's wedding. The main problem is that no one in the school, except for Nagisa, knows about Kouko because she stopped teaching at the school three years ago. After learning about Fuko's accident and her existence as an ikiry≈ç, or astral projection, both Nagisa and Tomoya decide to assist Fuko to achieve her dreams by giving all the students a carved starfish; including Fuko's friend Mitsui before she had the accident. :As the story progresses, Fuko starts to disappear from everyone's memories, due to her waning spiritual power, as the real Fuko had stopped breathing in the hospital. Determined to fulfill Fuko's dream and make Kouko's wedding happen, Tomoya asks Koumura- sensei to organize the wedding ceremony on May 18. Through many struggles and hardships, Kouko's wedding turns into a success Mitsui and all of the students who were given a starfish carving attend the wedding. After the wedding, Fuko thanks Tomoya for everything he did and congratulates her sister before disappearing. After the wedding, Kouko and Yusuke decide to thank Fuko in her hospital room. :Fuko's personality is childish and extroverted, causing most people who don't know her to believe that she is a grade school student. She is judgmental towards Tomoya; often calling him a weird guy but is secretly dependent on him. Due to her dependency on Tomoya, she has grown to love him and finally proves her feelings to Tomoya by kissing him on the cheek. In the After Story arc, through a miracle from one of Tomoya's light orbs, Fuko recovers from her coma. She becomes incredibly fond of Ushio, claiming that she'll kidnap Ushio from Tomoya in order to make Ushio her little sister. In Clannad's epilogue, she is seen coming across the Girl in the Illusionary World (who turns into Ushio) sleeping in the clearing where Nagisa had been saved from death so many years ago, asking her to play with her. :In the After Story arc, Fuko occasionally appears in various unexpected situations; this is actually a nod to the Fuko Ninja event in the game that happens in Tomoyo's path, after completing the entire game. ; : :Ushio is Tomoya and Nagisa's daughter. She appears prominently in the After Story, and in the film. Ushio resembles her mother a lot, and seems to like the Big Dango Family as well. After giving birth to her, Nagisa dies. This deeply saddens Tomoya to the point he gave up raising Ushio and left her to the care of Akio and Sanae. Tomoya resorts to alcohol and cigarettes to ease depression. :Five years later, Sanae arranges a trip to a flower field for Tomoya and Ushio in hopes that they will be together again. During the trip, Tomoya meets his grandmother, Shino, and learns about his father's past and the sacrifices he made for Tomoya, which leads him to regret his actions, and decides to raise Ushio and acknowledge Naoyuki as his father. Ushio reconciles with her father, Tomoya, when she lost a toy robot the first thing her father ever brought for her. Ushio is revealed to be a student at Kyou's kindergarten school. Shortly after Tomoya sets things right, Ushio is stricken with the same disease as Nagisa. Despite the efforts and sacrifices of Tomoya, Akio, and Sanae, Ushio's fever never subsides but worsens. In the coming Christmas winter, being filled with desperation of wanting to do anything for Ushio, Tomoya brings her for another trip, but she falls unconscious and dies shortly thereafter along with her father who succumbed to his grief, with her last breath being \\"Daddy I love you\\". Ushio is then revealed to be the Girl in the Illusionary World of her parents dreams. Desperate to save her family from a cruel fate, she created the world to meet Tomoya again, to collect light orbs to make a miracle possible. If enough light orbs are gathered, Ushio instead lives a happy life with her parents, and does not suffer from her mother's sickness. In the epilogue, Ushio is shown sleeping under the same tree where Akio begged for Nagisa's life to be saved, found by Fuko saying \\"the fun is just getting started.\\" :In the movie, after seeing Tomoya so depressed, his father asks his friends to take him to a train station where he meets with Ushio. It's hinted that he will stay with her and not end up like his father. Secondary characters ; : :Youhei is Tomoya's friend and also a delinquent. He entered the school on an athletic recommendation in soccer, but was kicked out of the soccer club after being involved in a fight with other members who had a tendency of harassing the younger players. After this incident, he became lazy, becoming the only student with a higher absence rate than Tomoya. He is left handed when it comes to sports and fighting, but he writes with his right hand, hinting that he is ambidextrous. He and Tomoya are known as the \\"Dirty Pair\\" in school. His hair is naturally black but he bleached it blond after joining the soccer club. He is highly protective to his sister Mei when they were younger. One of the story paths involves him repairing his relationship with his sister. Youhei often gets punished or beaten up by various characters due to his behavior, most notably by Kyou and Tomoyo. :Youhei plays a major role in some character paths, most notably the one revolving around him and his sister. In the After Story arc, he is inspired into becoming a model, and by the request of Tomoya, attends Nagisa's fake graduating ceremony. He also visits Nagisa when she is pregnant. According to the scriptwriters, he has the most appearances in the School Life arc. :In the movie, while Youhei remains the central comic relief character, he is also depicted as being somewhat more serious about life, such as when he gets a part-time job due to help his family through their tough financial situation. He also gets along much better with Tomoyo, and actively tries along with her to get Tomoya out of the deep depression he'd gone into after losing Nagisa. ; : :Yukine is a second year student who hangs around in the library's reference room during lunchtime. Tomoya first met her in the library's reference room while trying to find a \\"how to\\" book about speeches for Nagisa. He is immediately greeted by her hospitality, and returns the next day with Youhei due to Youhei's insistence. Ever since, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Youhei start to enter the library reference room routinely. She later avails Tomoya and Youhei an instruction book for magical spells for them to try. Most of them are in the favor of Tomoya, involving the girls they met. :She has friends outside of her school, which turns out to be delinquents from other schools. She made friends with the delinquents through her brother, Kazuto, who is also a delinquent, after his death trying to save a friend from an accident. Tomoya learns briefly about the legend of the light orbs through Yukine, which are called the \\"symbol of happiness\\". The light orbs are actually the Girl's wishes in the Illusionary World. :According to the script writers, Yukine was originally intended to be one of the main heroines of Clannad, but as her story did not reach their expectations, she was made into a secondary character. However, she was still depicted on the regular edition cover of the PC release, and on the PlayStation 2 release which used the same art as the regular PC release. ; : :Ryou is Tomoya's classmate and class representative. She is the younger one of the purple-haired Fujibayashi twins. Unlike her older sister, Ryou is timid and does not cook well (but is otherwise good at chores). She is a normal girl who is very keen about fortune telling, but her predictions, while incredibly specific, always manage to be either somewhat skewed or extremely wrong. Ryou plays as a major supporting character in both Kyou's path and Kappei's path. :Ryou has a crush on Tomoya, as shown in Kyou's arc, and needs Kyou's help on pursuing Tomoya. In Kappei's arc, she pursues Kappei instead, which worries Kyou. Ryou has her own optional path, where Tomoya pursues Ryou and become boyfriend and girlfriend, however it is considered as Kyou's bad end. Later, Kyou finally admits that she's in love with Tomoya; this leads Tomoya to break up with Ryou because he realized that he was really in love with Kyou. Kyou then cut her hair in sacrifice to hurting her sister, but Ryou assured her that it was okay, and that she couldn't help who she fell in love with. Ryou takes nursing course and as a nurse in the anime adaption Clannad After Story. Her job as a nurse is further proven, seen in Kappei's path five years later, where she works as a nurse, at the end of the story. ; : :Misae Sagara is the resident manager at Youhei's all-boys dorm. She was Hikarizaka's first female student council president when she was in high school. She achieved a full week of perfect attendance for the whole student body and she was loved by the students. Misae is friendly with the dorm students but strict when it comes to the dorm rules. She is also well liked by the rugby members. Depending on decisions, Tomoya can change her to a violent dorm lady through his lecture. :When Misae was young, she fell in love with a boy and hopes that one day she'll see him again. It's later revealed though that the stray cat she takes care of is actually the true form of the boy she is waiting for. When Tomoya tries to pursue Misae, the cat gives Tomoya a dream about Misae's past. When Misae was still in high school, she had two friends Saki and Yuki, and a guy named Igarashi that she liked. One day, Misae meets a boy who introduced himself as \\"Katsuki Shima\\", and insisted on granting her wish as a payment for encouraging him to recover. Misae's reluctance on giving him a wish to be granted and the boy's persistence cause them to spend time together, eventually leading into the development of mutual romantic feelings, especially after it is revealed that Igarashi already has a girlfriend. However, the boy realizes that his true identity is not Katsuki, but Katsuki's cat: before dying, Katsuki gave the cat the duty of granting Misae a wish. To satisfy Katsuki's continual attempts to grant her a wish, Misae asks for him to love her forever and ever. Having succeeded in his quest, the cat is returned to his original form without Misae's knowledge, leading her to believe Katsuki has disappeared. Meanwhile, she adopts what appears to her to be nothing more than a stray cat. At the town's autumn festival, Tomoya tells Misae about her cat's true identity. ; : :Yusuke is an electrician who once attended Hikarizaka high school and lived as a rock musician. Tomoya first met Yusuke during a street light accident involving a person's car, and assists Yusuke in his work. Yusuke is engaged to Kouko, and is also one of the reasons why Fuko exists in the school. He marries Kouko in the middle of the School Life arc and first season of the anime. :He plays a more prominent role in After Story, giving Tomoya a job as an assistant electrician at the Hikarizaka Electrical Company he works at, and on occasion, words of advice. He has an odd quirk of sometimes randomly saying dramatic and often strange or incoherent phrases. Due to Tomoya's interest in him, Yusuke tells him of his past - how he became a rock musician, rose in fame, and then subsequently broke down after receiving news that one of his fans committed a crime. He became overcome with stress and despair, which affected his music and eventually caused him to turn to drugs. After being rehabilitated, no one wanted him anymore except for Kouko, who had encouraged him to become a rock musician during his high school days. Throwing away his past, he now works as an electrician. Realizing that there are people who still love his music through Tomoya, Yusuke decides to create another music CD that sings his love for the city in which he resides. :In the movie, he is Tomoya and Youhei's employer. Yusuke is introduced in the movie trying to encourage Tomoya to come back to work, and he gives Youhei a part time job. He also plays a major part in facilitating Tomoya's reunion with his daughter in order to snap him out of his depression. ; : :Kouko is Fuko's older sister. She used to be an art teacher at Hikarizaka high school, and she treats everyone kindly. Kouko is one of the familiar faces in the Furukawa Bakery, and Nagisa admires her very much, being her former art teacher. Currently she is engaged with Yusuke Yoshino, and is the major reason why Fuko still exists in the school, despite the fact she's still in a coma at the hospital. Thanks to Fuko's efforts she does eventually marries Yusuke. After the marriage, she is now known as Kouko Yoshino. In the After story arc, she reappears when Fuko is finally released from the hospital. :In the movie, Kouko is one of the teachers for second year students instead of an art teacher, and is depicted as still working for the school, eventually becoming the supervisor for the drama club. She, along with Youhei and Tomoya helps revive the drama club for Nagisa. ; : :Toshio Koumura is a language teacher at Hikarizaka high school and Tomoya's home room teacher during his first year. His age conceals his once vigorous past marked by his enthusiasm in teaching. He was friends with Kouko Ibuki three years ago. :Five years ago, he was a strict teacher in an engineering school, well known for changing a lot of delinquents in the school for the better, but at Tomoya's school, his skill is not needed due to the prestigious image of the school. It was because of him that Tomoya and Youhei ran into each other in the first place, and it's heavily implied that he deliberately arranged them to do so, knowing that if they had at least one good friend, they'd have a reason to keep going to school and not drop out. He retires one year later, prior to the end of the school segment of the story. In After Story, he returns and organizes the fake graduating ceremony intended for Nagisa, arranged by Tomoya. ; : :Kappei is a mysterious nineteen-year-old young man who is traveling around. His goal in life is \\"to live like a man\\". Tomoya will meet Kappei if he chooses to avoid Kyou's scooter on the right side. Kyou intends to hit Tomoya as a revenge for Botan running back home wet, but hits Kappei instead. While stunned, a kind girl helped him recover before leaving quickly. Unbeknownst to her, she left her handkerchief behind. :Kappei's goal is to find a job and to find the kind person that he met with after the crash. The kind person turns out to be Ryou, and through her he finds a job at the hospital. Both of them start to become intimate ever since. However, it was revealed that he had osteosarcoma, a cancer which he carried since he was young, causing him to be hospitalized and is also revealed to have once been a prodigious athlete for his school. :Kappei refuses to have his legs amputated even though it would cause him to die because he could not bear not being able to run, but is convinced out of it by (mainly) Ryou and Tomoya, who were encouraged after having received advice from Yusuke. Ryou manages to convince him (one the methods she uses is threatening him by getting pregnant with his baby while he sleeps, which proves just how deeply she cares for Kappei) to get cured. Ryou also informs Kappei that a new technique of treatment using liquid nitrogen would not require an amputation. This encouraged him and he finally decided to take the operation. Five years later, Tomoya visits the hospital again to see Kappei (who is in therapy for recovery), and Ryou, working as a nurse in the hospital, guides him to Kappei's room where he greets him with a nostalgic line. Kappei eventually marries Ryou Fujibayashi happily two years after they first met. :Kappei is the only character in the visual novel who does not appear in any of the animated versions of Clannad. Families ; : :Naoyuki is Tomoya's father. His wife, Atsuko Okazaki, died when Tomoya was young, thus leaving only himself to raise Tomoya. After the accident, Naoyuki turned to alcohol and gambling, and had strict fights with his son. One day while arguing with his son on trivial things, he slammed Tomoya against the wall, dislocating Tomoya's right shoulder. Immediately after that, Tomoya went to the hospital; it was declared to be untreatable. Ever since then, Naoyuki has treated Tomoya more kindly, but like a stranger rather than family. This only hurt Tomoya even more, so he becomes a delinquent, as he is unable to participate in basketball activities any longer, and he avoided returning to his home early enough to be confronted with his father. Tomoya has the intention of running away from his home, as revealed from Kotomi's path. After moving in at Nagisa's house, Naoyuki came to see her play, much to the surprise of Tomoya. :In the After Story, Naoyuki is put in prison due to some problems. This prevents Tomoya from ascending in his job, and he visits his father in prison. He visits him again later to tell him that he is going to marry Nagisa, to which his father consents. Five years later, as revealed from Shino's story about Naoyuki, even though his wife Atsuko died and he had become depressed, Naoyuki sacrificed everything in his life just for Tomoya's sake, hoping Tomoya to grow up to be a proper man unlike him. Tomoya finally understand what his father was going through and decides to forgive him, admitting that he indeed was a good parent. After Tomoya comes to terms with his father, Naoyuki decides to return to his hometown to stay with his mother, claiming his role as a father has finally come to an end. :In the movie, Naoyuki is shown to work a graveyard shift with hardly any time to come home, instead of staying home and becoming a drunk and gambling addict (though it's clear that he did still have a tendency to copiously drink while Tomoya was growing up, hence leading into their estranged relationship). He's also depicted as being more consciously aware of his actions and more actively trying to repair his relationship with Tomoya, going out of his way to have a talk with Tomoya and even contacting Tomoya's friends and family to orchestrate a trip for Tomoya so he can spend time with his daughter Ushio, in order prevent his son from becoming like him. ; : :Shino is Tomoya's grandmother on his father's side. She only appears in the After Story portion of the plot. During Ushio's path, when Ushio is finding her toy robot she lost in the flower field, Tomoya meets Shino at the edge of the cape, who introduces herself to him and their meeting is planned by Sanae. Shino tells the story about Naoyuki's past and tragedy after Atsuko's death, which is similar to what Tomoya is facing after Nagisa's death, along with his sacrifices made for Tomoya just to see him grow up to be a proper man. After listening to Shino's recounting of his father's story, Tomoya feels deep remorse for having neglected his daughter, and for how he'd treated his father who he now realizes had loved him all along, and decides to mend his relationship between himself, Ushio and his father. Shino tells Tomoya to relay a message to Naoyuki that she wants him to return home so she can be with him, which Naoyuki agrees to after finally making amends with Tomoya. ; : :Akio is Nagisa's father and the husband of Sanae Furukawa. He looks deceptively younger and is shown to be an avid smoker. Although he often talks and plays rough (in addition to having a reckless personality) he is kind and sympathetic. His child-like side makes it easy for kids and adults alike to befriend him. He runs the Furukawa Bakery with his wife Sanae. Akio shows how much he is in love with his wife, and how much he cares for her too. In his spare time, Akio plays baseball with children in the small park next to the bakery, and indulges in the Gundam and Star Wars fandoms. He is often the victim of Sanae's bread, frequently insulting her bread while unaware she is actually in the room, and consequently having to eat the bread in front of her while claiming that he loves it in order to pacify her hurt feelings. :During the School Life arc, it's revealed Akio had been a talented aspiring actor in a theatrical company, but had to quit his job due to Nagisa's health. Akio replaces Youhei's role as the comic relief during the After Story arc, however, he can be serious when needed, as he often gives advice to Tomoya on what it is like to be an adult and a father. He tells Tomoya the story about how Nagisa almost died due to his and Sanae's unintended negligence. Nagisa had been sick with a fever, but because Akio and Sanae were unable to get time off from work, they left her home alone. When Akio came back to check on her, he'd found her collapsed outside in the snow, as she had attempted to go outside to wait for her parents to come home. Desperate, he ran through the town while holding Nagisa and crying, praying that she wouldn't die. When he came upon a clearing, a light shown and seemingly miraculously, Nagisa woke up. Akio expresses a belief that after she was saved, Nagisa's health became connected to the town. ; : :Sanae is Nagisa's mother. Normally she's very childish and a cry-baby, but when needed she can be very strong-willed and dependable. She runs the Furukawa Bakery with her husband Akio. She often tries out strange concepts to make breads that are anything but edible, and almost never get sold. Outside of the bakery, she tutors children. She looks extremely young compared to her actual age, frequently being mistaken for being Nagisa's older sister instead of her mother, and even being able to pass as a high school student if she dresses a certain way. :Sanae plays a larger role in After Story, often comes to Tomoya's aid when Nagisa is sick and needs to be accompanied, especially during Nagisa's pregnancy. Before being a baker at the Furukawa Bakery, she was a middle school teacher, and had to quit her job due to Nagisa's health. Sanae is the mastermind behind Tomoya and Ushio's trip to the flower cape, in hope for them to reconcile. She knows Shino, Tomoya's grandmother in his father's side, although it is never revealed how they met. She also pretended to Youhei's girlfriend to show his sister Mei that he does have a future but Mei finds out that he is pretending. :In the movie, instead of being a teacher, it is said that she was also an actor and was in the same acting troupe as Akio, before having to quit in order taking care of Nagisa. ; : :Mei is Youhei's younger sister who loves Youhei as a brother and lives in the countryside. Mei is a smart girl and likes to see new things. She is a fan of Yusuke Yoshino. Worried about her brother's situation, she calls Youhei, but instead of her brother, Tomoya disguised as Youhei tells her to come. :Mei's personality is a direct opposite of that of her brother, Youhei. She can be very nosy about things, like trying to further Tomoya's relationship with Nagisa by becoming their cupid angel or learning Youhei's current situation. Although Youhei tries to avoid Mei, he still cares for her, as seen when he stands up for her when she gets bullied by the soccer club in Sunohara sibling's path. The two siblings eventually grow closer as a result. Illusionary world ; : :The only human in the illusionary world, a world that both Nagisa and Tomoya have dreams of, and is the basis for the play Nagisa puts on after successfully reinstating the drama club. The girl creates a body out of junk for an unnamed entity only referred to as \\"I\\", so that she will not be alone anymore. At the edge of death after failing to get away from the world, it is revealed that she is actually Ushio who had lost her memory after dying in the real world, regaining it back just long enough to inform the junk robot that they have a linked past and that he is actually her father, Tomoya. She created the Illusionary World in order to collect enough lights to make a miracle possible and save her family from their tragic fate, although she holds no recollection of this. In Clannad's epilogue, she is shown sleeping under the tree where Akio had once begged for Nagisa's life long ago, and is apparently seen for a brief instant by Fuko, though it turns out to be the real Ushio. ; : :He has no name, but narrates the situation in the Illusionary world seen through Tomoya's dream while referring to himself only as \\"I\\". His body was created by the girl in the illusionary world out of junk so that she wouldn't be alone. The body is about half the girl's height. He can't talk, as he had been created without a mouth, so relies on body language to communicate with the girl. When on the edge of death in the illusion, the girl is revealed to be Ushio, and she informs the robot that he is her father, Tomoya, and tells him to collect light orbs to create a miracle that will save their family from the tragedy that had befallen them. He later succeeds in doing this. :In the anime, he is sent back into the past, where his past self (with memories of the bad future) reasons that if he had never met Nagisa, neither of them would have suffered, and seems about to change history so that they never stopped to talk to each other. But then he and his 'other self' (the junk robot) become one mentally, and ultimately they decide to meet Nagisa, who also remembers the future, and had hoped that he wouldn't regret meeting her. After this, they wake up in a world where Nagisa survives. Other characters ; :Voiced by: Chisako Tatsumi (game), Mai Aizawa (drama CD, series), Rozie Curtis (English) :Rie is a second-year student at Hikarizaka Private High School who used to play the violin as a child, and won many competitions. She had a lot of talent and was supposed to go to study abroad, but she was involved in an accident. As a result, her grip became weak and she was unable to play the violin as well as she had previously been able to, having lost her main aim in life. However, when she entered high school, Toshio Koumura taught her about chorus, and she discovered that she could sing very well. Thus, having discovered a new reason to live on, she decided to form a chorus club with her friends. Her best friend is her fellow club member Sugisaka. Kotomi befriends with her when Rie lend her violin to her. Rie wishes to go to music school after graduation. :Rie attends Nagisa's fake graduation ceremony, and starts working at a family restaurant with Sugisaka as waitresses, where she eventually gets Nagisa to work at too. ; :Voiced by: Ai Band≈ç (Japanese), Lesley Tesh (Clannad English dub), Jessica Boone (Clannad After Story English dub) :Sugisaka is a member of the Choir Club. She appears when Nagisa asks the Choir Club if they could have Toshio Koumura as their advisor. Sugisaka actively refuses, and even threatens to hurt Nagisa if she tries to establish the Theater Club. Youhei, Tomoya, and Nagisa eventually confront her after school. Sugisaka later explains that Rie used to play the violin well when she was little, but got into an accident. When Rie went to high school, she and her friends formed the Choir Club since Rie always looked lonely, and because Rie could still sing. She then begs Nagisa to not get in her way, but Youhei calls Sugisaka a cheater for trying to get their sympathy. She appears with Rie to watch Youhei, Tomoya and Kyou go against the Basketball Team. When Tomoya and the rest won the match, Sugisaka relented and reached a compromise with Nagisa: they would share Koumura as an advisor for their clubs. :Sugisaka and Rie attend Nagisa's graduation. She is seen working with Rie and Nagisa in a family restaurant as waitresses. ; : :Katsuki only appears during Misae's arc, which explains the events which happened to her some years prior to the beginning of the Clannad storyline. He was Misae's boyfriend for a while. It is revealed that Katsuki is a boy who Misae met in the past while he was in a wheelchair in the hospital. Her kind words encouraged him to recover. Years later, he searches for her with the hopes of paying her back. We discover that he is not the real Katsuki Shima, because the real Katsuki died, but not having been able to thank Misae and grant her wish, he entrusted this mission to his cat, who took a human form. During the main Clannad series, we can see the cat often accompanying Misae around. ; : :The unnamed gentleman is a strange man who in Kotomi's arc one day approaches her out on the street. One day as Tomoya is out by himself, he sees the man outside Kotomi's house and approaches the man, asking who he is. The gentleman answers that he used to be one of Kotomi's parents' colleagues, and that there's something important he has to talk to Kotomi about. He tells Tomoya a complicated story about the Ichinoses' research and their scientific discoveries. Tomoya learns about Kotomi's past in the Illusionary World, he finds out that the gentleman is actually Kotomi's official guardian and godfather, as her parents died in a plane crash several years earlier. The man they all thought was a bad guy was actually trying to give her the birthday gift she was promised as a little girl, a teddy bear. ; : :Yu is a young boy who first appears in Yukine's arc. He is first seen \\"arm locking\\" Yukine because his sister is at Kazuto's gang. After calming down, Yu tells Yukine that his 21-year-old sister ran away after a fight with their mom. Yukine tells him that she would help him find his sister and speak to the gang. Yu is very grateful for this. After reuniting with his sister, Yu is seen later with Youhei (impersonating Kazuto), who is teaching to be a man. ; :Atsuko is Tomoya's late mother. She died in a traffic accident when Tomoya was too young to remember her, leaving Naoyuki, his father, to raise him alone. Atsuko and Naoyuki got married while still in high school. Her appearance seems to resemble that of Nagisa. In the After Story, when Shino tells Tomoya the story about Atsuko and Naoyuki, he finally understands his position of being a father for Ushio. ; :Kazuto is the deceased brother of Yukine Miyazawa. He was a delinquent, but was kind to his sister. He was not on good terms with his parents. His appearance resembles Youhei, and his personality is like Tomoya. It is said that he was the only person who could take on Tomoyo in a one-on- one fight. Kazuto is revealed to be leader of a gang of delinquents. They were up against another gang and their leader, Sasaki, fighting over territory. :He died in a car accident escorting his friends' home. No one else knew this because Yukine and her brother's gang didn't want the word out to their rival gang that their leader is dead. When everyone learns the truth, they instead decide to end the rivalry, which Kazuto wished for. Yukine, Nagisa, and Tomoya, along with both gangs, visit his grave. ; : :Botan is Kyou's pet baby boar, and is a comic relief character. Botan will sometimes go to Kyou's school just to see her. Due to her small size and the fact that she is a baby boar, she is sometimes captured by several characters who talk of eating her. In the After Story, Botan has become an adult boar, but still acts the same. Botan has seven different skills, one of them being able to take the appearance of a stuffed animal by being extremely still. Other skills shown in the visual novel include Rugby Ball; Botan assumes the shape of a rugby ball for Kyou to use and throw (at Tomoya) instead of a dictionary, Pillow; a softer appearance of a stuffed animal, and Massage; Botan self-vibrates. At Kyou's kindergarten school, Botan is loved by Ushio and the kids.

Advertising campaigns for toys have been criticised for trading on children's naivete and for turning children into premature consumers. Advertising to children is usually regulated to ensure that it meets defined standards of honesty and decency. These rules vary from country to country, with some going as far as banning all advertisements that would be directed to children. Brief history Mechanical Tin Toy Locomotive, as pictured in a 1900 wholesale catalog The commercial sale and marketing of children's toys only became popular in the mid-18th century. Prior to this, children had access to relatively few toys, and of those toys in use, most were hand-made, either by the child or a close relative.Kline, S., Out of the Garden: Toys, TV, and Children's Culture in the Age of Marketing, London, Verso, 1995, p. 145; Brown, K.D., The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700, London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 12-14 Toys that were in common use from at least medieval times were very basic items such as hoops, tops, balls and dolls which could be turned out by local carpenters or coopers. A scattering of toy shops traded in 17th-century London, but were virtually unknown outside the capital. A small quantity of mechanical toys were imported from France and Germany, but these were expensive and beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest families.Brown, K.D., The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700, London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 12-14 A broader interest in children's toys and games coincided with the emergence of a middle class when fewer children were expected to work. The 18th-century attitude to toys was that they should educational. Accordingly, toymakers designed their products to prepare children for adult life.Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 17-19 For example, a rocking-horse taught children to balance and prepared them for horse-riding. A doll prepared girls for motherhood and child-rearing while toy soldiers taught young boys about the military. Virtually, from the outset, commercially produced toys were remarkably gendered.Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood Harvard University Press, 2009, p. 52; p.67 and p.80 Dinky die-cast truck with 1937 catalog By the mid-nineteenth century, technological developments such as the invention of sheet metal stamping machines facilitated the mass production of inexpensive toys, notably tin toys or penny toys. Other technological developments included the advent of papier mache and \\"India\\" rubber moulding machines which effectively lowered the costs of manufacturing dolls. To stimulate demand for toys, it was necessary to encourage parents to purchase toys for their children. However, to do that, it was necessary to change attitudes to toys; to promulgate the idea that children were children rather than 'adults in training' and that toys were developmentally useful.Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 18-20 Toy manufacturers were late-comers to modern marketing and advertising techniques. The earliest commercial toymakers relied on standardised mass production manufacturing techniques, with its emphasis on achieving economies through long production. Designs and models were changed rarely. Toy design was conservative; and always aimed at securing parent approval. Toymakers rarely attended the international exhibitions.Brown, K.D., The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700, London, Hambledon Press, 1996, p. 45 Early advertising appeared in wholesale and retail catalogs where advertisements appeared alongside mousetraps and match holders. Advertising messages were targeted at parents and spoke of the educational value as well as the toy's durability. Toy advertising rarely showed children using the toys. The tenor of toy advertising and marketing was that adults decided what toys were appropriate for children.Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 20-23 Demographic and social changes were beginning to affect attitudes to toys and children's play throughout the 19th-century. The decreasing size of families meant that children had fewer siblings and that toys became an important diversion and source of entertainment. Rising living standards and wages meant that parents had more disposable income. Middle-class children remained in education for longer periods, with the implication that they had less time to make their own toys, and were more reliant on commercially manufactured toys.Brown, K.D., The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700, London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 52-53 By the late 19th-century, parents were beginning to appreciate the special needs of childhood and that toys were more than just the preparation for the real world, but that they could also offer a retreat from mundane realities.Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood Harvard University Press, 2009, p.51 In the 1890s and early 1900s, a toy trade press emerged on both sides of the Atlantic. In England, the Toy Trades Journal first appeared in March, 1891; the Sports Trader appeared in 1907 and the short-lived Games, Toys and Amusements journal appeared in 1908.Brown, K.D., The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700, London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 61-62 In America, Playthings magazine was launched in 1902. These trade-oriented journals began to publish articles advising toymakers and toy retailers on methods for optimising sales of children's toys.Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood, Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 18-20 By the late 19th century, toymakers were beginning to adopt modern marketing practices. Manufacturers and distributors began using mail-order catalogues to reach consumers directly. Montgomery Ward, for example, produced a catalog listing 23,000 items including toys. The new department stores began to include toys in window displays in which goods were featured as part of an artistic fantasy. Toymakers began to develop a unique style or personality that could be linked to a company name or brand. Advertising for toys began to appear in consumer magazines. Advertising messages encouraged mothers to take their children shopping with them, and to watch how the child interacted with toys in order to identify the child's preferences.Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood Harvard University Press, 2009, p.30; Brown, K.D., The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700, London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 31-32 By the mid-20th century, the traditional approach of marketing through mothers (also known as the \\"gatekeeper model\\") was waning. Children, who by this time, were the recipients of pocket-money, made individual purchasing decisions, as part of their education in the world of consumption.Schor, J.B., \\"The Commodification of Childhood,\\" in Stephen J. Pfohl, Van Wagenen, A., Arend, P., Brooks, A. and Leckenby, D. (eds), Culture, Power And History: Studies in Critical Sociology, Lieden, Brill, 2006, p. 100 Television broadcasting in the mid-20th century provided toymakers with the ability to reach national children's audiences. In the late 20th century, the merchandising of film and TV characters in the form of dolls or figurines, gave toy marketers access to international audiences.Cross, G. and Smits, G., \\"Japan, the U.S. and the Globalization of Children's Consumer Culture,\\" Journal of Social History, Vol. 38, No. 4, 2005; Kline, S. ‚ÄúToy Marketing and the Internationalization of Children‚Äôs Television,‚Äù in Paul Rutten and Monique Hamers-Regimbal, Internationalization in Mass Communication and Cultural Identity, Holland, Sommatie, 1995 Campaign intentions advertised through comic books and children's magazines. Toy advertisements are aimed at three target audiences: children, adults (especially close relatives such as parents or grandparents), and toy retailers. Different message and media strategies are used for each target group. To gain the attention of children, advertising messages might focus on products are often brightly coloured, fast moving designs; or associations with heroic characters from film, TV, or books. Packaging can enhance the attractiveness of a toy. When advertising toys to adults, the educational benefits to the child are often promoted. When promoting toys to retailers, the ability of a product range to generate store traffic and profits is likely to be mentioned. Children up to the age of five can find it difficult to distinguish between the main program and commercial breaks. This is particularly so when a toy range is linked to a television series they are watching. Many children do not understand the intentions of marketing and commercials until the age of eight.Patti M. Valkenburg & Joanne Cantor. \\"The Development of a Child into a Consumer. Journal of Marriage and Family Vol. 63, 2001, pp 655‚Äì668. Media literacy programmes such as Media Smart are being used to help children understand and think critically about advertising.http://www.mediasmartworld.com/ Children are not easily persuaded to want something. Advertising is only part of the picture. Children's interests in a particular toy are likely to arise from word of mouth and peer pressure. Two-year-olds spend about 10% of their time with other children. This rises to 40% between ages 7 to 11.K. A. Updegraff, et al. (2001). Parents' involvement in adolescents' peer relationships: A comparison of mothers' and fathers' roles. Journal of Marriage and Family 63, 655‚Äì668. The term \\"pester power\\" refers to children nagging their parents to buy a product. Some children will repeatedly ask them to buy a toy they want, and such insistence often leads to a purchase. There is regulation http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:149:0022:0039:EN:PDF in place that bans advertisements from directly exhorting children to buy advertised products or persuade their parents to buy the products. Advertisers sometimes try to stimulate word of mouth promotion of products. Many toys are directed towards one specific sex and advertising is tailored to meet their particular needs. There are biological as well as social and cultural reasons for boys' and girls' different toy preferences.Gerianne M. Alexander, Teresa Wilcox, & Rebecca Woods. (2009). Sex differences in infants‚Äô visual interest in toys. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 38, 427‚Äì433. Like other consumer products, toys may also be offered as sets. While each one may be affordable, it may be an investment to \\"collect them all\\". Intentions The natural credulity of young children means that advertising to children is almost always a sensitive issue. The average child is exposed to approximately 40,000 commercials a year.Donald L. Shifrin, M. C. (2006, Dec). Children, Adolescents, and Advertising. American Academy of Periatrics , 2563-2569. These messages are channelled through television, the internet, bill board campaigns and print media. Toy marketers are also known for more direct approaches, targeting schools. Doing so by producing toys that are advertised with ‚Äòeducational benefits‚Äô throughout primary school catalogues and news letters. A study on child advertising during Dec 2007 examined the relationship between television commercials and children's requests to Father Christmas. Throughout the findings there was a significant correlation between the items requested and the commercials viewed. Proportionally there was a greater number of brands requested when associated with higher television viewing time.Pine, K. J., Wilson, P. B., & Nash, A. S. (2007, December ). The Relationship Between Television Advertising, Children's Viewing and Their Requests to Father Christmas. Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 28, 456. These findings reflect the impact marketers have on children. Through the use of advertising, brands are shaping the opinions and beliefs of young children every day thus generating an unrelenting appetite for branded merchandise. The intentions of toy manufactures are to influence children while they are young to gain brand loyalty, devolving premature consumers. The consumers of the future. Marketing strategies towards child advertising are paid high attention to as the market is generating approximately 21 billion dollars into the United States economy each year.Statista. (2015).

Retrieved from Statista: http://www.statista.com/topics/1108/toy-industry/ This is possible due to the influential amount of purchasing power children have when pressuring their parents, through what marketers refer to as ‚Äòpester power‚Äô.McDermott, L., O'Sullivan, T., Stead, M., & Hastings, G. (2006). International food advertising, pester power and its effects. International Journal of Advertising, 513-539. Consequence Persuasive commercials achieve such proportionate amounts of revenue, as children under the age of twelve have less cognitive ability to recognise the purpose of the advertisement.Rozendaal, E., Opree, S. J., & Buijzen, M. (2016, Jan). Development and Validation of a Survey Instrument to Measure Children's Advertising Literacy. Media Psychology, 72-100. Brands sell a life style, presenting to children the idea of happiness. Children at a vulnerable age believe that the life style being sold to them is the truth,Lanka, S. (2011, July 7). Ethics in marketing and advertising to children. Colombo. and by obtaining the products viewed they will mirror these impressions. The mind set that purchase equals an acquired identity can be dangerous. It can present low self-esteem amongst youth because their reality is not compromised by their materialistic gain. The journal of Social and Clinical Psychology conducts a model proving the relationship between materialistic values, compulsive buying tendencies, self discrepancies and low self-esteem that acts in a spiralling effect.Dittmar, H., \\"A NEW LOOK AT \\"COMPULSIVE BUYING\\": SELF-DISCREPANCIES AND MATERIALISTIC VALUES AS PREDICTORS OF COMPULSIVE BUYING TENDENCY, Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, Vol. 24, 2005, pp 832-859. This is due to the fundamentals of human nature which involves an endless amount of wants which contrasts with a disappointing reality. An example of this is Barbie, who is globally advertised as a best friend for young woman. In commercials Barbie comes to life portraying personality. Marketers use idealistic settings to falsely advertise the lifestyle that comes with Barbie; either on the beach or in a night club. Settings are designed to convince children of this idealistic reality and an experience that they too can share with her. Yet, in reality Barbie's potential relies on a child's imagination. The setting is not included. Mainly she has no relatable characteristics for children to look up to, establishing the argument of social pressures and self-esteem. For toy companies however this is parallel to revenue. Strategies Marketers adopt certain strategies to create demand behind their products. Physically, toy packaging is generally bright attractive colours and interactive textures. They have recognisable logos and slogans which children can familiarise themselves with easily. They also have convenient shelf access in stores. Many companies also target children based on their genders. Product placement Effective advertising strategies also heavily involve product placement; The marketing practice in which a business pays for its brand or products inclusion throughout a film or television programs.Russell, C. A., & Stern, B. B. (2006 ). CONSUMERS, CHARACTERS, AND PRODUCTS: A Balance Model of Sitcom Product Placement Effects. Journal of Advertising , 7-21. Theory suggests that the limited cognitive process which occurs when a child engages in television inflicts a feeling of familiarity to stimulate preference.Auty, S., & Lewis, C. (2004). Exploring Children's Choice: The Reminder Effect of Product Placement. Psychology and Marketing , 697-713. Toy Story, a famous all time Disney movie worked in association with toy makers, basing the movie characters off real life toys. Mr Potato Head, Slinky Dog and Etch a Sketch original sales needing refreshing. After the release of the film in 1995 the sales of the toys that featured in the Toy Story movie skyrocketed. In correlation, the Disney Movie Frozen is a franchise within itself generating a net worth of $2.25 billion.QUARTZ. (2014, August 05). Disney will keep milking \\"Frozen\\" for all it‚Äôs worth. Retrieved from QUARTZ: http://qz.com/245225/disney-will-keep-milking-frozen-for-all-its-worth/ Disney has capitalised on the films wide audience by constructing a profitable franchise supplying Frozen Character dolls, teddies, lunch boxes, clothing, duvet covers and more. According to Dave Hollis, executive vice president for distribution at Walt Disney Studios, Disney had troubling marketing to males. To over come this Disney found that boys respond more to humor therefore Olaf, the comedic Snowman was advertised as much as the two female lead characters were.Kline, D. B. (2014, May 14). How Disney Will Make 'Frozen' a Billion- Dollar Franchise. Retrieved from The Motely Fool : http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/05/14/how-disney-will-make-frozen- a-billion-dollar-franc.aspx The success of this strategic marketing was reflected in the exit polls which read that 43% of the audience during opening weekend were in fact male. Using this particular advertising strategy Disney in theory doubled their targeted audience. Celebrity and character endorsement The influence of famous characters in commercials haze the lines between programmes and advertisements. An example throughout the journal Children as Consumers explains how celebrity endorsements in commercials have positive effects on a child's response throughout the sales of toy cars.Adrian, F., & Barrie, G. (2008, January ). A Psychological Analysis of the Young People's Market. Children as Consumers, 224. Cross-promotions of businesses heavily involve celebrity and character endorsements. For ten years Disney worked in collaborating with McDonald's, promoting the latest Disney films throughout the McDonald's Happy Meals. The connection between toys and fast food for young children creates a fun experience. Evident in the American Academy of Paediatrics journal, 20% of fast food restaurants advertisements now mention a complementary toy in their ads. The consequence of this illusion, that fast food is fun, holds businesses accountable for exploiting children and contributing to the global epidemic of child obesity. Where one in three children are classed as obese throughout New Zealand alone Ministry of Health. (2015, December 10). Annual Update of Key Results 2014/15: New Zealand Health Survey. Wellington , New Zealand. Ryan Kaji, the main visual representation of Ryan's World on YouTube is said to be the highest-paid creator of videos in the year 2019. He uses his big following of 23 million subscribers to advertise and endorse specific toys that appeal to children and parents everywhere. Nearly 90 percent of his videos include at least one paid recommendation of a toy. His method of advertising is by giving these toys a good review so people will feel the need to buy them. Toy premiums, games and collectibles Contest and give away prizes are effective practices marketers use to entice children and increase the sales. Cereal companies are renowned for contest and giveaway prizes, directly targeted at children. Similar to fast food, cereal companies generate excitement around their brand through the use of toys and games. Competition based advertisement can increase sales traffic as consumers believe the more they buy the higher their chances of winning are. This is also effective when the prized toy is a mystery and children have to buy the product to find out what it is. An example of this is the Weetbix All Black campaign, where Weetbix released All Black collector cards. Weetbix was able to engage their targeted audience, young boys, to want to purchase Weetbix so they can get the nationally loved rugby team's trading cards. By collecting and trading the cards also enhances social benefits for young children. By using rewards schemes Weetbix has encouraged children to choose a healthier cereal for breakfast. This is counteractive towards competitive sugar based cereal brands thus benefiting both Weetbix and children. Exclusive kids only Marketers have been known to entice children through the use of exclusion. By directly advertising products as ‚Äòkids only‚Äô builds the experience feel special. This type of advertising is common throughout food companies, promoting that this drink or snack is just for kids making it immediately more engaging. The company Trix, an all-time favourite American cereal slogan reads \\"Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids.\\" Promoting the impression of exclusion and importance. For toy company's exclusion is established through gender. Toys are specially designed for boys and girls and are exclusively showcased in separate aisles. Children begin to develop stereotypical, gender based knowledge during preschool and by the age of seven they have strong, established views on toy gender.Perry, L. C., & Sung, H.-y. A. (1993). Developmental Differences in Young Children's Sex-Typing: Automatic versus Reflective Processing. 18. Research found that when children aged seven to eleven were asked to choose a toy, most selected traditional gendered based occupational toys, reflecting role play. Children throughout this age group were also more likely to create rivalry with the opposite sex.Francis, B., Power Plays: Primary school children's constructions of gender, power and adult work, Trentham Book, 1998 Self-identity makes toy's distinctly gender bias progressing sale transactions.  Packaging  Toys are advertised in shops and on product packaging. The colour on the packaging of a children's toy is often carefully selected in order to appeal to a certain demographic. The educational benefits of toys are also explained on packaging for the benefit of parents. Skills which a child will gain, such as hand‚Äìeye coordination, exploration and problem solving are made explicit. Channels of advertising Common methods of advertising include: *Comic book advertisement *Television commercial campaigns *Print media campaigns *Billboard campaigns *Product placement in films and television programs *Various forms of branding, including clothing *Online marketing *New media The first televised toy commercial to be shown in the United States was for Hasbro's Mr. Potato Head in 1955.BusinessWeek. January 29, 2007. \\"Hardly Babes In Toyland\\". Accessed August 22, 2007. Since then television has been one of the most important media for marketing toys. The Internet has created new opportunities for advertisers and new strategies have been developed to take advantage of the new media technology. Now a significant part of youth culture, new technologies enable marketing campaigns to reach children in a different way. Interactive games are a new medium which can be used to advertise toys to children. Regulation In response to the perceived dangers of advertising to children some countries and districts have highly regulated or even banned these marketing avenues. In Sweden all advertisements aimed at children under the age of 12 have been banned and they are lobbying the European Union to do the same. Similarly Quebec's Consumer Protection Act includes provisions to ban print and broadcast advertising aimed at children under the age of 13.See sections 248 and 249 of the Quebec Consumer Protection Act Advertising impact can be lessened if parents and teachers talk to children about the purpose and nature of advertising.Moniek Buijzen.

It was founded in 1781 and closed in 1992. History Nottingham General Hospital in 1815 Nottingham General Hospital from The History and Antiquities of Nottingham by James Orange, 1840 The hospital was the result of a legacy from John Key, a wealthy banker, who had left money in his will for hospitals to be built in Nottingham and York. The site selected for the hospital in Nottingham was part of the area known as Nottingham Park, immediately to the north of Nottingham Castle and near the wharves: one half of the land was given by Thomas Pelham-Clinton, 3rd Duke of Newcastle for the purpose and the other half by the town corporation.Bittiner and Lowe, p. 8 The foundation stone for the first building, which had been designed by John Simpson, was laid on 12 February 1781 and the hospital opened with 44 beds in September 1782. John Wesley, the theologian, was an early visitor to the hospital.Bittiner and Lowe, p. 9 The hospital was extended with the Derbyshire wing, financed by a large donation from Henry Cavendish,Bittiner and Lowe, p. 15 which opened in 1787. In 1844 the hospital had to respond to a major disaster when 12 people were killed and over a hundred injured when a stand collapsed at a public hanging on Garner's Hill.Bittiner and Lowe, p. 19 A design for a third storey for the original building was developed by Thomas Chambers Hine and the works completed in 1855. Another new wing on the Park Row frontage opened in 1879, and the Jubilee Wing, designed by Alfred Waterhouse in a circular shape to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, opened in 1900.Bittiner and Lowe, p. 21 During the First World War 102 beds were made available to the Government for wounded soldiers.Bittiner and Lowe, p. 24 The Nurses Memorial Home was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1923 as a monument to the soldiers of Nottinghamshire who had died in the First World War.

He combated Jansenism in his parish due to the threat that it posed to the faith. He served as a teacher and preacher and was known for his ardent devotion to both the Eucharist and the Sacred Heart. The sainthood cause commenced under Pope Leo XIII in mid-1899 while Pope Benedict XV later named him as Venerable on 10 December 1916 upon the confirmation of his heroic virtue. Pope Pius XI beatified him in 1923 while Pope Pius XII later canonized him as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church over a decade later in 1947. Life Michel Garico√Øts was born on 15 April 1797 in Saint-Just-Ibarre as the first of six children of the peasants Arnaud Garico√Øts and Gratianne Etch√©verry. His parents remained faithful and true to the spirit of the faith during the persecutions of the French Revolution while also doing their best to shelter priests. His father helped priests flee persecution and helped them cross the border into Spain. One brother was born after him in 1799. In 1801 he trespassed into his neighbour's home and hurled a stone at a woman who he believed had wronged his mother before fleeing the scene. In 1802 he stole a pack of needles from a travelling salesman ‚Äì his mother reprimanded him for this ‚Äì and in 1804 stole an apple from his brother to his mother's disdain. In 1806 he was sent to the village school but was taken out in 1809 to work as a servant on a farm for additional income. In his childhood he was noted for silent contemplation and for singing Psalms while guarding the cattle. In 1810 he was sent as a servant to another farm at Oneix and there made his First Communion on 9 June 1811 ‚Äì it was this event that served as the trigger for his religious vocation. He decided that he wanted to become a priest and so returned to his hometown and told his father: \\"I want to be a priest\\". His father said it would be impossible due to their poor financial condition (he said: \\"No! We are too poor\\") but his maternal grandmother Catherine Etch√©verry knew a parish priest and convinced him to enroll him at school for studies before he became a seminarian. He attended school at Saint-Palais where he studied Latin and French in the candlelight late into the night while paid his expenses through working for priests and in the local bishop's kitchen ‚Äì the cook there had a disliking for him for unknown reasons. The parish priest Jean Baptiste Borda gave him private lessons. Garico√Øts commenced his studies for the priesthood in Aire-sur-Adour and later in Dax. He was asked to teach seminarians at Larressore despite still being a student himself. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 20 December 1823 at the Bayonne Cathedral from Archbishop ‚Äì future cardinal ‚Äì Paul-Th√©r√®se-David d'Astros. He was appointed as the curate to the town of Cambo not too far from where he was ordained and he was there from the beginning of 1824 until late 1825 when he was sent to B√©tharram to teach philosophical studies. In 1833 the diocesan bishop ceased education for seminarians in that place for unknown reasons and he was left to care for that Marian shrine and its pilgrims. It dawned on him to begin his own religious congregation for all priests and professed brothers and dedicated it to the Sacred Heart as a means of evangelizing to people through missions. Before he founded it he attended a month retreat with the Jesuits in 1832 for guidance and his spiritual director Father Le Blanc helped to guide him along the right path. Garico√Øts helped Jean Elizabeth Bichier des Ages found her religious order while later establishing his own in 1838. He died in the morning about 3:00am in mid-1863 due to an apoplexy. He had suffered from poor health since 1853 and in 1859 was quite ill but rallied from this until Lent in 1863 when his condition deteriorated to the point where he knew his death was near. His final words in a low murmur were: \\"Have pity on me, Lord, in Your great mercy\\". Name His Basque surname is the origin of the male name \\"Garikoitz\\". Sainthood The sainthood process commenced under Pope Leo XIII on 15 May 1899 and Garico√Øts was titled as a Servant of God. Pope Benedict XV confirmed that the late priest had lived a model life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable on 10 December 1916 as a result. Two miracles approved allowed for Pope Pius XI to preside over his beatification on 10 May 1923 while a decree resumed the cause on 23 July 1924. Two additional miracles were investigated and received the validation of the Congregation for Rites on 17 July 1929. A preparatory committee approved them both on 13 April 1943 as did a general committee on 15 February 1944 and Pope Pius XII on 27 February 1944 who confirmed his sainthood. Pius XII proclaimed Garico√Øts to be a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 6 July 1947.

Domsiah rice is related to Basmati rice. Domsiah is especially valued for its aroma, which is more expressed than other Basmati-type of rices, and for its ability to end up as a fluffy, flaky and very light but tasty substance as basis for other ingredients of a meal. Research is trying to develop High Yielding Varieties (HYV) which could eventually replace Domsiah and help farmers obtain 5-7 tons per hectare, however, on the Iranian market quality goes before quantity so farmers can earn more money by cultivating Domsiah yielding only 2 - 2.5 tons per hectare.

In 2007, he was the Republican candidate for Louisiana Attorney General. In addition to his law practice, Alexander is an opinion writer, a guest lecturer at public events and education forums, and a frequent guest on various TV and radio outlets. Education and career The fifth of twelve children born to a prominent Shreveport businessman, Alexander was educated in private elementary and secondary schools. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Louisiana State University in Shreveport. He obtained his law degree from Oklahoma City University School of Law where he served on Law Review and Moot Court, both intramural and on the Benton National Moot Court Team.http://sbmag.net/april-2014/, page 76. He was a law clerk to Judge Rebecca F. Doherty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. An appointee of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, Doherty is based in Lafayette and Opelousas. Himself a former administrative law judge, Alexander has also been in private practice, handling both criminal and civil cases.Royal Alexander  Attorney General Alexander was chief of staff to former U.S. Representative Rodney Alexander of Louisiana's 5th congressional district. The two are unrelated. In 2006, the Democrats in Washington, D.C., accused Royal Alexander and several others, including members of Congress, of having acted too slowly regarding the disclosure of the name of the congressional page who was sent inappropriate email messages by then U.S. Representative Mark Foley of Florida. (The page lived in Rodney Alexander's House district.) Evidence showed that Royal Alexander reported the inappropriate email messages to the staff of House leadership upon his learning of the information. The matter quickly died after the 2006 congressional election, in which Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress. Alexander was a staff member to the late U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway of Louisiana's 8th congressional district, since disbanded, who also served as chairman of the Louisiana Public Service Commissionhttp://www.lpsc.louisiana.gov/DistrictMapPage.aspx. He was also a member of the Republican State Central Committee of Louisiana from 2008-2012. Race for attorney general A first-time candidate for public office in 2007, Alexander finished second to James D. \\"Buddy\\" Caldwell, then a Democrat, in the nonpartisan blanket primary for state attorney general. Alexander outpolled incumbent Democrat Charles Foti of New Orleans for the right to enter the general election against Caldwell, a five-term district attorney from Tallulah in northeast Louisiana. Caldwell received 477,574 votes; Alexander 395,645 votes. Foti (previously the long-time sheriff of Orleans Parish) finished with 389,658. With only four weeks between the primary and the general election, the traditional Democratic political machine of sheriffs and district attorneys flocked to fellow Democrat Caldwell. Alexander was defeated in the second round of balloting when Foti's base switched to Caldwell. In 2011, Caldwell switched his affiliation to the Republican Party and won a second term but was defeated in 2015 by Republican Jeff Landry. Alexander's primary strength was demonstrated in Shreveport, Alexandria, and Monroe. Caddo Parish assessor candidacy Alexander was the unsuccessful Republican candidate in the October 22, 2011, primary for Caddo Parish tax assessor. He polled 16,255 votes (34.9 percent), while the incumbent Democrat, Charles Russell Henington, Jr. (born September 1957), received 30,310 votes (65.1 percent). Henington last faced opposition in 1999, when he won the assessor's position by defeating an earlier Republican candidate, John W. Wessler, by a five-to-one margin. Henington's father, Charles Henington, Sr. (1936-1986), and his step-grandfather, Albert Galloway Hammett, Sr. (1881‚Äì1974), previously served as the Caddo Parish assessor, having kept that office within the reach of one family for, through 2011, seventy-eight years. A. G. Hammett was the assessor from 1933 to 1964. According to KTBS-TV, ABC in Shreveport, an independent survey of property tax rates around the state by the demographer Elliott Stonecipher concludes that Shreveport and Caddo Parish residents pay the highest such taxes of any metropolitan area in Louisiana.

She was the daughter of Duke Conrad II of Znojmo and his Serbian wife Maria of Rascia (daughter of Uro≈° I). Helena was probably named after her maternal aunt, Queen Helena of Hungary, wife of King B√©la II.According to Jan D≈Çugosz, Helen was a daughter of Rostislav Mstislavich, Grand Prince of Kiev. He erroneously deduced her parentage on the basis of her Russian-sounding name. This was corrected by more recent historiography. Born as princess of the Znojmo Appanage (named after its centre, the town of Znojmo in southern Moravia), she later became by marriage Duchess of Sandomierz (1173-1194), Grand Duchess of Krak√≥w and the Seniorate Province (1177-1194), Duchess of Masovia (1186‚Äì1194), and Duchess- regent of Krak√≥w and the Seniorate Province, Sandomierz, and Masovia on behalf of her minor sons from 1194‚Äì1198, then the latter two duchies plus Kuyavia until 1199/1200.  Life  Helen married Casimir II the Just, youngest son of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, probably shortly after his return from captivity,K. Jasi≈Ñski cit., pp.266‚Äì267 which at the latest was before 1161. When Helen's husband Casimir II died on , presumably as a result of a heart attack,R. Horn, Polish kr√≥lob√≥jcy, Warsaw 1994, p. 27 he left her with their two minor sons on whose behalf she assumed the regency of Krak√≥w and the Seniorate Province, Sandomierz, and Masovia with blessings from the Fulko, bishop of Krak√≥w, and the Krak√≥w voivode. Helen's regency was not an easy one, because other princes threatened her minor sons. Their own uncle Mieszko III the Old was after Krak√≥w and the Seniorate Province. This situation between Helen and Mieszko III lasted until the Battle of MozgawƒÖ in September 1195, in which Mieszko III was seriously injured and his son Boles≈Çaw of Kuyavia was killed. In 1198, they reached an agreement: Mieszko would take Krak√≥w, in return for which he gave Helen and her sons Kuyavia (they retained Masovia and Sandomierz). Independent authority over the inheritance was assumed by the eldest son, Leszek the White, in 1199 or 1200. Helen's intelligence and character were recorded in the chronicle of Vincent Kadlubek, who knew the princess in person. According to him Helen was \\"a woman with greater wisdom than usually women have\\". Helen of Znojmo died between 1202 and 1206,MORAVIA, Medieval Lands probably on April 2.According to Jan D≈Çugosz, Helena was still alive on December 24, 1211. However, this date was challenged by Oswald Balzer. (2005) Genealogia Piast√≥w. [1st pub. Akad. Umiejƒôtno≈õci: 1895]. 2005. Krak√≥w: Wydawnictwo Avalon. p. 327. .  Children  Helen and Casimir had the following children:There is a very unlikely possibility, but which cannot be completely ruled out, that Helen was the second wife of Casimir the Just.

She designed and planted a number of significant gardens, including the White House Rose Garden, and assembled one of the largest collections of rare horticultural books. Mellon was the second wife of philanthropist and horse breeder Paul Mellon. Background Rachel Lowe Lambert, nicknamed Bunny by her mother, was the eldest child of Gerard Barnes Lambert, president of the Gillette Safety Razor Company and a founder of Warner‚ÄìLambert, and his wife, Rachel Parkhill Lambert (n√©e Lowe). Her paternal grandfather, chemist Jordan Lambert, was the inventor of Listerine, which was later marketed by her father. She had two siblings: Gerard Barnes Lambert, Jr. (1912‚Äì1947; married Elsa Cover), who died in a 1947 plane crash, and Lily McCarthy (1914‚Äì2006; married twice, to William Wilson Fleming and John Gilman McCarthy, respectively). Lambert attended Miss Fine's School, Princeton, New Jersey and the Foxcroft School, Middleburg, Virginia. Her parents divorced in 1933, and both subsequently remarried. Lambert married Stacy Barcroft Lloyd, Jr. in Philadelphia in 1932. Lloyd served in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. They divorced in 1948. They had two children: Stacy Barcroft Lloyd III, and Eliza Winn Lloyd. Eliza predeceased her mother.Eliza married photographer Henry Dermot Ponsonby \\"Derry\\" Moore in 1968 and divorced him in 1972. On the death of his father in 1989 he became the 12th Earl of Drogheda. After her divorce, Eliza Winn Lloyd used the name Eliza Lambert Lloyd, but her wedding announcement in The New York Times in 1968 called her Eliza W. Lloyd, and news articles about her coming out in 1961 referred to her as Eliza Winn Lloyd. Her obituary in The New York Times, however, referred to her as Eliza Lloyd Moore. Lambert and her husband became close friends of the banking heir and art collector Paul Mellon and his first wife, Mary Conover, who died of an asthma attack in 1946. After Bunny divorced Lloyd, she and Paul were married, on May 1, 1948. By this marriage, she became the stepmother of Timothy Mellon and Catherine Conover Mellon (later Mrs. John Warner and now known as Catherine Conover). Together the couple collected and donated more than a thousand works of art, mostly eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European paintings, to the National Gallery of Art and established the Yale Center for British Art. The couple bred and raced thoroughbred horses, including Sea Hero, winner of the 1993 Kentucky Derby.Paul Mellon: In his Own Words; accessed June 5, 2012. Mellon was long known for her maximal discretion and minimal public exposure; she offered only a handful of interviews to journalists in her lifetime. In a 1969 New York Times article with the Mellons, she proclaimed that \\"nothing should be noticed.\\" Although this remark was made in reference to garden design, it has frequently been taken to encapsulate her attitude toward personal privacy and lifestyle choices. Gardening career The White House Rose Garden after Mellon's landscaping Although she had no formal training, Mellon read widely in horticulture and made contributions to several landmark gardens. Her interests in gardening were first cultivated while watching Olmsted Brothers gardeners tend her family's New Jersey home. Mellon amassed a large collection of horticultural books and was regarded as an authority on American horticulture. Her work was strongly influenced by French gardeners Andr√© Le N√¥tre and Jean-Baptiste de La Quintinie. Mellon designed landscapes for many of the Mellons' properties, including the French-inspired gardens of their estate, Oak Spring Farms. A longtime friendship with the Kennedy family was initiated by a 1958 visit to Oak Spring Farms by Jacqueline Kennedy, whom Mellon later advised on fine arts and antiques during the Kennedy White House restoration. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy asked Mellon to redesign the White House Rose Garden. Mellon created more open space for public ceremonies and introduced American species of plants, as well as Magnolia soulangeana. She next began to work on the White House's East Garden, but her work was interrupted by Kennedy's assassination. After his funeral, for which Mellon arranged flowers, Lady Bird Johnson asked Mellon to resume her work on the White House grounds. After Jacqueline Kennedy left the White House, Mellon was asked to design landscapes for Kennedy's home in Martha's Vineyard, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, and River Farm, the headquarters of the American Horticultural Society. In France, Mellon created a landscape design for the home of Hubert de Givenchy and assisted with a restoration of the potager du Roi in Versailles. Wealth and collections As most of her assets were invested in trusts, it was difficult to estimate Mellon's wealth, but her family and husband's fortune and fixed assets suggest she was exceptionally wealthy. She maintained homes in Antigua, Nantucket and Oyster Harbors, Cape Cod, two apartments in Paris, and a townhouse in New York City. These properties were sold in the years preceding her death. Her main residence, Oak Spring Farms, was a estate in Virginia, that had its own long airstrip to accommodate her Falcon 2000. Mellon gathered a sizable collection of works by artist Mark Rothko, having purchased many of his 1950s works directly from his New York studio. In a 2010 interview, she spoke of having purchased a total of thirteen works by Rothko. One of the works, No. 20 (Yellow Expanse), completed in 1955 was considered one of the largest Rothko works in private hands. The painting measured 10 by 15 feet. On November 10, 2014, items from Mellon's collection of paintings, jewelry, furniture, and decorative objects were auctioned at Sotheby's in New York for a total of $158.7 million, including Untitled (Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Light Orange) by Rothko, which sold for $36.5 million, and another Rothko that went for $39.9 million. Three of her most important paintings, two by Rothko and one by Richard Diebenkorn, were sold privately before the Sotheby's auction for a reported $250 million. Proceeds from the sales benefited the Gerard B. Lambert Foundation, a charitable entity established by Mellon in memory of her father.\\"Sotheby's to auction Paul and Bunny Mellon estate\\", nytimes.com; July 1, 2014; accessed August 22, 2014.

Shortly thereafter, in May 2000, her daughter Eliza was hit by a truck while crossing a Manhattan street, causing a severe brain injury and full-body paralysis. Eliza spent the remaining eight years of her life under round-the- clock care at Oak Spring Farms, and died in 2008. Caroline Kennedy, daughter of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, sat beside Mrs. Mellon during the funeral. Mellon was a long-time Democrat whose political views often conflicted with those of her husband. In 2004, she expressed interest in presidential candidate John Edwards because he reminded her of President Kennedy, but when she called his campaign office with an offer to help, her name was not recognized and the call went unreturned. She was an early financier of Edwards' 2008 Democratic primary run, offering an initial US$1 million commitment to his campaign, and eventually contributing more than $3.5 million to organizations supporting his candidacy. At the request of campaign operative Andrew Young, the commitment morphed to include underwriting Edwards' personal expenses. Beginning in May 2007, Mellon contributed more than $725,000 to John Edwards' personal accounts over an eight-month period, writing checks disguised as furniture purchases. During this period Mellon wrote a note to Young stating: \\"from now on, all haircuts, etc. that are necessary and important for his campaign‚Äîplease send the bills to me... It is a way to help our friend without government restrictions.\\" The funds were secretly used to support Rielle Hunter, a campaign videographer with whom Edwards had an extra-marital affair and child. When Mellon became aware of the use of her funds for this purpose, she reportedly came to regret the donations, but maintained that Edwards \\"would have been a great president.\\" While investigating Edwards, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Mellon at Oak Spring on two occasions in 2010. In December 2010, four of her relatives were subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury. On June 3, 2011, Edwards was indicted on using campaign funds to help cover up an affair and pregnancy during the 2008 presidential campaign. Just one week prior to his indictment, in late May 2011, Edwards visited Mellon at her Upperville estate. Following his indictment, the judge forbade Edwards to speak with any potential witnesses. In 2010, it was reported that Mellon had lost $5.75 million to investment adviser and convicted Ponzi scheme operator Kenneth I. Starr. Death Described as a resilient centenarian, a bout with cancerObituary, newsweek.com; accessed August 29, 2016. and ongoing macular degeneration nonetheless slowed her activity. She was forced to give up gardening by 2011, although she continued to swim, do Pilates, and give the rare interview. On March 17, 2014, Mellon died at her Upperville, Virginia, home of natural causes. She was 103 years old. Her funeral was held at Trinity Episcopal Church, which the Mellons had constructed in 1960 to resemble a 12th-century French church. She was eulogized by her friend actor Frank Langella who described himself as \\"a rough Jersey kid\\" whom Mellon taught \\"how to listen, dress, never be vulgar, respect all people, be humble, avoid hubris, write thank-you notes, never boast, be curious and 'above all, be loyal'\\". Her grandson, Stacy Lloyd IV, remembered Mellon as \\"Granbunny\\" and how she taught him to find beauty in everything. Her friend, Bette Midler, performed her hit song The Rose.

After only one appearance for the Hearts team in the Wartime League, he left for Arakan, where he served in The Royal Scots during the Second World War. McKenzie returned to Edinburgh at the war's conclusion and established himself in Hearts first team as a left back.

Homer Smith and several German √©migr√©s, who wanted America to join the war against the Axis powers, provided funding for the secret and unlawful commissioning agency. Its mission was to bring Americans to Canada in order to prepare and battle for the Allies while the US was still neutral. By Canada allowing the training to take place on their soil, it is considered the most important contribution it made to the Allied air war. This was before the US declared war on Japan and Germany. The committee was forced to defend itself from opposing forces such as, \\"pacifists and isolationists, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\"Guinn, Gilbert Sumter. The Arnold Scheme: British Flyboys, the American South and the Allies' Daring Plan. Charleston, SC: History Press, 2007, , pages 36-40. Founding The Clayton Knight Committee (CKC) was founded when Hitler was enforcing the expansionist policy on Europe. Britain, along with her Commonwealth countries recognized that in order to halt him, they had to establish a dominant air force. Canada, Australia, Britain, and New Zealand created the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). It also went by the 'Empire Air Training Scheme'.\\" Each country had responsibility for varying aspects of the overall plan, such as aircraft engines (Britain), trainers (Britain), cost of elementary trainers (Canada), etc. It had plans to prepare and instruct 150,000 potential airmen. The advancements of the BCATP would fall on the shoulders of well-known Canadian World War I ace Billy Bishop. His plan was to gain access to the quickly advancing American aviation industry for BCATP. There was a major impasse: \\"American Neutrality\\". This resulted in Bishop contacting his friend Clayton Knight.Guinn, pages 36-40. Knight had many connections in American aviation circles. The committee was responsible for 10,000+ American enlistments in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) before December 7, 1941, the date of the Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The CKC was established in the spring of 1940. The committee used brochures and word of mouth advertising to attract candidates.Gaffen, Fred. Cross-Border Warriors Canadians in American Forces, Americans in Canadian Forces: from the Civil War to the Gulf. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1995, page 47. The CKC's requirements for pilots were considered lenient by established RAF pilots. Some American pilots exaggerated their flying hours to gain acceptance by the CKC. However, the CKC rejected 86% of the pilots who applied. Bishop also reached out to Canadian Homer Smith, an ex-pilot.Gaffen, page 47. A World War I veteran of the British Royal Naval Air Service, Smith was heir to an oil fortune. Bishop was able to attain support from him financially.Behiels, Michael D., and Reginald C. Stuart. Transnationalism Canada-United States History into the Twenty-First Century. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2010, , page 225. Smith also was a source of connections to airline presidents, flying school owners, and Civil Aeronautics Authority officials. He was considered the committee's director. WWI flyer C.R. Fowler also played a role in the committee. Knight and Bishop revealed to the Air Council in Ottawa that they acquired 36 pilot trainers for the whole BCATP, which had started recruitment in Manhattan.Behiels, Michael D., and Reginald C. Stuart, page 226. One of their biggest obstacles was the possibility of loss of American citizenship for those who pledged loyalty to the British monarch when entering the RCAF. The State Department was briefed by Canada on the issue and requested that an oath to obey superior officers be substituted for the oath of allegiance. This matter was eventually abolished when the Canadian government enacted an Order in Council that put in place a momentary agreement to adhere to RCAF rules for the length of their time.Behiels, Michael D., and Reginald C. Stuart, page 227. Bishop spent a portion of 1940 in London, working with Winston Churchill. This meant Clayton Knight was forced to search for new associates to establish their headquarters. The original headquarters was founded in New York at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Later it expanded to nine cities in America, such as San Francisco, Dallas, and Kansas City. There were offices in Canada as well, to assist those returning to the US after rejection or for those looking for accommodations. Committee expenses were funded through a rotating bank account, which was created in Smith's name. In May 1940, the committee discussed their plans with Major General Henry H. Arnold and Rear Admiral John Henry Towers. These American military leaders felt that there were plenty of good candidates for pilots available. Arnold even offered to provide the committee with a list of failed candidates from American training efforts. The CKC had to maintain a low profile to evade possible obstruction by German agents and the hovering F.B.I. They had to find a way to obtain help from the President, even though his publicly stated goal was to prevent America from going to war. Because of the constant hiding, Clayton Knight had to cover up his covert occupation. He used his art and journalistic contacts to work as a \\"special correspondent for the Associated Press,\\" which posed as a guise from his family. Knight maintained his aviation artwork contributions to publications like The Saturday Evening Post. The CKC had to ensure that the American pilots crossing the border into Canada had all the proper documents. They also had to fill in civilian instructor and staff pilot positions in the BCATP's Air Observer Schools and Elementary Flying Training Schools. Those who ended up in contact with the CKC were offered positions in the RCAF or RAF or civilian jobs as elementary training instructors, staff pilots, or RAF ferry pilots. Attempts to end the committee's operations Many times during 1940, the American State Department and the F.B.I. blocked the committee's work. The committee was encouraged to keep as few records as possible and cease lending travel money to potential recruits.Behiels, Michael D., and Reginald C. Stuart, page 231. The Dominion Aeronautical Association was founded in January 1941 to create a buffer between the RCAF and the committee. The committee would now seek personnel for civilian positions. The committee's charge was expanded, after consultations with American leaders in Washington, to find personnel for aircrews in 1941.Behiels, Michael D., and Reginald C. Stuart, pages 232-233. The United States State Department alerted the Canada Department of External affairs to not shut the CKC down, as long as the committee obeyed American laws. The financial conduct of the committee and Homer Smith's status on the RCAF reserve list caused major problems. Travel loans were not repaid by potential candidates, which meant they were technically gifts. \\"Providing funds for an American to join a foreign armed service was a violation of the law against recruiting U.S. nationals.\\" Because Smith was on the RCAF reserve list, he was violating the law which required the registration of agents working for foreign governments.

Its post code is 4530. It should not be confused with the other Warnant in the Province of Namur. History The region was settled by the Franks as early as the 4th century. Merovingian tombs have been found in Warnant and surrounding villages north of Huy. The first mention of Warnant goes back to the 11th century, with a knight named Sebastian of Warnant. The Counts of Oultremont, one of Belgium's oldest noble families, originated in Warnant. Their oldest ancestor in direct line is Otto of Warnant, who at the end of the 13th century was lord of Warnant and Moha. In 1266, Otto cedes all his goods in Warnant to the Abbey of Floreffe. The Premonstratensian monks would henceforth be present in Warnant, notably at the so-called Abbey's Farm. They would also serve the two churches in the village, St. Remi and St. John the Baptist. The two churches were merged by the Bishop of Li√®ge in 1451. St. John the Baptist's Church was demolished in the 16th century, but the other one is still standing nowadays. The first castle of Warnant, a fortified dungeon facing St. Remi's Church, was destroyed under the rule of Otto I in 1276, in the heat of the War of the Cow, which ravaged the Principality of Li√®ge and the County of Namur between 1275 and 1278. After Otto I, the House of Warnant would split in several branches, including the La Neuville, Ladrier, Oultremont, Saint-Jean, Fumal, Vaux, etc. The family thus controlled most of the hamlets in the area, and provided many Bailiff of Moha, Grand Bailiff of Hesbaye, Alderman of Huy and Li√®ge. The branches of La Neuville-en-Condroz and Oultremont would later become Barons. In 1731, Jean- Fran√ßois-Paul-Emile d'Oultremont was elevated to the rank of Count of the Holy Roman Empire. One of his children, Charles-Nicolas d'Oultremont would be elected Prince-Bishop of Li√®ge in 1763. The Warnant/Oultremont family is the only surviving Belgian family which has counted a Prince-Bishop of Li√®ge amongst its members. In 1823, the villages of Warnant and Dreye were merged to form the municipality of Warnant-Dreye, which in turn was added to Villers-le- Bouillet as a sub-municipality in the municipal reorganization of 1977.

(6 August 1681 ‚Äì 29 November 1742) was an Italian friar of the Order of Conventual Friars Minor who has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church. He was a friend of another Conventual friar, the Blessed Antonio Lucci. Early life He was born Giovanniello Fasani on 6 August 1681 in Lucera, in the Province of Foggia, then part of the Kingdom of Naples. He was the son of Giuseppe Fasani and Isabella della Monaca.Vatican News Service \\"Francis Anthony Fasani\\" He began his studies at the Conventual friary in his town and there entered the Order, taking the religious names of Saints Francis and Anthony. Fasani professed his religious vows in 1696. Religious Life Once having professed his vows, Fasani began theological studies in Agnone and continued them in the General Study Centre at Assisi, close to the tomb of St. Francis. It was there that Fasani was ordained to the priesthood in 1705. He stayed in Assisi and completed his theological studies there in 1707. From 1707 until his death in 1742, Fasani spent the rest of life in residence in his hometown of Lucera and endeared himself to the faithful of that town and all of Daunia and Molise. In 1709, he received the degree of Doctor of Theology and, from that time on, Fasani became known to all as \\"Padre Maestro\\" (\\"Father Master\\"), a title which is still attributed to him today in Lucera. Fasani also fulfilled many duties in the Franciscan Order, being a respected teacher of scholastic philosophy and was entrusted with the position of Master of novices and the junior professed friars. He was later appointed to serve as the guardian of the community of friars and the pastor of the town. He came to be elected Minister Provincial of his province in the Order.American Catholic \\"St. Francesco Antonio Fasani\\" As a worthy ministry of \\"the one who uninterruptedly exercises his priestly mission for us in the Liturgy through the Spirit\\" (PO, 5), Fr. Fasani dedicated himself with zeal-especially the administration of the sacrament of Penance and the celebration of the Holy Eucharist. \\"He heard the confession of every type of person,\\" asserted a witness, \\"with the greatest patience and kindness on his face\\". He was charitable and welcoming to all, giving as his reason the hope of being able one day to say to the Lord: \\"I was indulgent, I don't deny it; but it was You who taught me to be so.\\" Fasani was known for having a deep life of prayer and was considered to be a mystic, becoming greatly in demand as a confessor and preacher. He constantly preached popular parish missions, gave retreats and led Lenten devotions and novenas - either in his own town or wherever he was requested. It was reported by his contemporaries that he would levitate while at prayer. At the same time, he was a steadfast friend of the poor, constantly seeking out the financial support necessary for efforts to meet their needs.Patron Saint Index \\"Saint Francesco Antonio Fasani\\" Fasani died in Lucera and was buried in the parish church there. Upon the news of his death, children could be heard running through the streets shouting, \\"The saint is dead! The saint is dead!\\" Veneration The proceedings to open the cause for his canonization began several years after his death. Testimony to his holy life was given by many people of region. Among them was his old friend, Lucci, who by then was a bishop in the region. Progress did not take place, however, until the 20th century, when he was beatified in 1951, and subsequently canonized in 1986. His feast day is celebrated by the Franciscan Order on 29 November.
