Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=876825 on 2016-05-18 Description The shell up to 15 mm high with rather high spire and a rounded body whorl. The protoconch is small, distinctly cyrtoconoid with 2.5 smooth whorls. The teleoconch contains 6-7 convex whorls, with a sculpture of regular spiral cords, broader than the interspaces. Its axial folds become distinctly flexuous on the body whorl. The aperture is bordered externally with a strong varix forming a rim, normally unique - not repeated at the earlier growth stages on the spire. The inner side of the outer lip bears ca. 10 denticles, elongated in the spiral direction. The parietal edge of the aperture forms a very thin, appressed callus, with a distinct adapical denticle, continued into a thicker columellar callus with a slightly raised edge. The base of the body whorl has a groove delimiting the outer part of the siphonal canal. The colour of the shell is extremely variable, with distinct combinations of brown, black, yellowish or orange hues, most often with a paler band on abapical part of spire whorls and periphery of body whorls. Elsewhere it is arranged in bands or in spiral series of blotches, or uniform. The aperture is white with a highly diagnostic black blotch inside the siphonal canal. Distribution This species occurs in European waters, throughout the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Norway to southern Morocco, also off the Canary Is. and the Azores) at depths between the shoreline to ca. 100 m.

It stood on the Wessex Main Line at its junction with the western end of the Devizes branch.  History  The Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway Company opened their line southward from near Chippenham, at first only as far as Westbury, in 1848; the line passed Holt village to the southeast but there were no local stations. The company sold its line to the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1850. In 1857 the GWR completed the Devizes branch line, which met the earlier line to the east of the village. By 1861 there was a single-platform station at the junction to allow passengers to transfer between main line and branch trains. Holt Junction station opened to passengers in 1874, although the only access from the village was by footpath; in 1877 a road connection was made and a goods shed was added. In 1862 the GWR extended its Reading-Hungerford line westward via to Devizes, creating a route from London Paddington to the South West. However, usage of the Devizes line declined from 1900 after the opening of the shorter Stert-Westbury link. In 1897 the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company (later Nestl√©) converted Staverton Mill, about one mile from the station, for condensed milk production. In 1909 a large covered loading bay was built to the west of the station; this remained in use until 1934, when the factory gained a direct rail connection. From 1905 the GWR used rail motors (self- propelled carriages) to provide local services on the Chippenham-Westbury line and the Devizes branch.  Closure  The goods yard closed in 1963 and the rest of the station, along with the branch line, closed in 1966.

The spire is composed of seven whorls, rounded and swollen at the upper part, especially the lowest, which is larger than all the others united. The three upper whorls are finely plaited. The body whorl has a few fine, transverse striae near the base. The aperture is white and ovate, pretty strongly emarginated, and oblique at the base. The depth of the cavity is chestnut-colored. The thin outer lip is white and very finely striated internally. The inner lip is thin, white and shining and partially covers the body of the shell. The columella arcuated and terminates at the base by a sharp, and slightly projecting keel. The exterior of the shell is red or fawn-colored, ornamented with an articulated band of white and violet upon the upper edge of the whorls, with waved longitudinal yellow or red spots, the tint of which is sometimes very deep, and often very pale. This shell, which is very common, presents somewhat remarkable varieties of color. Sometimes its ground is red ; and white, undulated, very crowded flames, or brown and distant longitudinal lines ornament it from one end to the other. At other times it is whitish, which happens when it has been a long time exposed to the light ; and in this case transverse striae are perceptible on its surface. But the articulated band about the suture always appears in each of these varieties.Kiener (1840).

These are slightly angular at their upper part, loaded with very convex longitudinal folds near the suture. These folds are less prominent, and more flattened upon the outer lip of the body whorl. It is intersected by numerous transverse striae. The upper extremity of the fold is sometimes separated by a stria which divides them superficially. The white aperture is ovate, terminated above by an emargination of the outer lip, and by a transverse ridge of the inner lip. The outer lip is thin, slightly denticulated at the base, furnished with numerous striae; internally. The columella is arcuated, covered by the inner lip, which conceals, by its expansion, a part of the body of the shell, and forms a large, white, and polished callosity.

Description The shell grows to a length of 12 mm. It has a high, slightly cyrtoconoid (almost with the shape of a cone, but having convex sides) spire and a somewhat constricted body whorl. The protoconch consists of ca. 3 rather large and smooth whorls. The first three teleoconch whorls contain spiral cords and axial folds, which fade out on the next two except for the subsutural spirals. The body whorl resumes a spiral sculpture of very even, flattened cords much that are broader than the interspaces. The aperture is lanceolate. The outer lip is slightly thickened externally and bears 5‚Äì6 strong rounded denticles inside. The parietal callus is appressed and devoid of a parietal denticle. It continues into a columellar callus which has a rounded edge, slightly raised over the siphonal canal and bearing a few tubercles. The colour of the shell has a brownish hue over a white background. The subsutural and median cords are articulated with darker brown. The aperture is white.

De Longchamps, 1 U.S. 111 (1784), was a case resulting from the \\"Marbois Affair,\\" heard by the Pennsylvania Court of Oyer and Terminer at Philadelphia. State Court Decisions in the United States Reports The decisions appearing in the first volume and few appearing in the second volume of the United States Reports are not actually decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Instead, they are decisions from various Pennsylvania courts, dating from the colonial period and the first decade after Independence. The case Charles Julian De Longchamps (the \\"Chavelier De Longchamps\\") was accused of verbally assaulting the Consul General of France to the United States, Francis Barb√©-Marbois, on May 17, 1784, in the house of the French Minister. Two days later, De Longchamps allegedly \\"violently did strike\\" the consul on a public street. De Longchamps was convicted by a jury of threatening bodily harm to De Marbois, and was further convicted of the actual assault. The Court of Oyer and Terminer was then asked to consider whether De Longchamps should be extradited to France, or whether he should be imprisoned in Pennsylvania until the French sovereign was satisfied. M'Kean, Chief Justice, held that the laws of nations formed a part of the law of Pennsylvania. He further held that the insult of the physical assault surpassed the actual damage. Still, it was an assault. The Court, led by Chief Justice M'Kean, held that De Longchamps could be neither legally deported nor imprisoned. However, the Court noted that De Longchamps had violated the Law of Nations, since \\"The person of a public minister is sacred and inviolable. Whoever offers any violence to him, not only affronts the Sovereign he represents, but also hurts the common safety and well being of nations; he is guilty of a crime against the whole world.\\" The Court further stated, \\"You then have been guilty of an attrocious [sic] violation of the law of nations; you have grossly insulted gentlemen... in a most wanton and unprovoked manner: And it is now the interest as well as duty of the government, to animadvert upon your conduct with a becoming severity, such a severity as may tend to reform yourself, to deter others from the commission of the like crime, preserve the honor of the State, and maintain peace with our great and good Ally, and the whole world.\\" Assault, being a common \\"municipal\\" crime, was not addressed in the opinion. It was only the verbal threats, in the home of the Minister, which were thought to violate the Law of Nations. Outcome The Court refused to imprison De Longchamps for an indeterminate period of time. It therefore fined him 100 French Crowns, imprisoned him for two years, and forced him to pay bail as collateral for good behavior of seven years. Significance Some Constitutional scholars, such as Richard Tuck, conjecture that the case was an impetus for the \\"Law of Nations Clause\\" being put in the U.S. Constitution, and for the Constitutional Convention in general. Though Pennsylvania handled the affair somewhat aptly, there was a fear that other states couldn't be trusted to do the same. For that reason, the new federal government in 1787 was given the power \\"to define and punish...Offenses against the Law of Nations.\\" (Art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 10). In Federalist No. 42, James Madison wrote: \\"These articles [of confederation] contain no provision for the case of offenses against the law of nations; and consequently leave it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the Confederacy with foreign nations.\\" It is perhaps the De Longchamps case that helped to engender this fear, and it was the Law of Nations Clause that was to assuage it.

The station was on the Devizes Branch Line, in between Holt Junction and Seend.  Opening  Semington Halt station opened in 1857 for the residents of Semington, during a time when the Great Western Railway was increasing the number of halts in the South West. After completion of the eastern section of track, the Devizes line was a main line from London to Bristol, which meant passing through Semington. However the Devizes line lost to competition and returned to a branch line in 1900.  Closure  Semington Halt suffered from reduced traffic after the completion of the Stert and Westbury Railway that bypassed the Devizes branch line in order to reduce the London to Bristol distance by five miles. The entire branch line was closed in 1966 under the Beeching cuts and the halt was destroyed in 1970, along with the rest of the line. The site of the station is now a private residence.

The degree of fictionalization in these works varies and, although they are often written by Christians or Jews, this is not always the case. Originally, these novels were consistent with true belief in the historicity of the Bible's narrative, replete with miracles, and God's explicit presence. Some of these works have been important and influential, and eventually there have appeared heterodox Bible novels that reflect modern, postmodern or realist influences and themes. An early Bible novel that may still be the most influential is Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ by Lew Wallace, and published by Harper & Brothers on November 12, 1880. It remained the best-selling American novel of all time, surpassing Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) in sales and remaining at the top of the US all-time bestseller list until the publication of Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind (1936). Ben-Hur is a bildungsroman and adventure novel that follows the tumultuous life of its protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur. He is a fictional Jewish noble from Jerusalem who suffers betrayal (by a boyhood friend) and consequently his enslavement and his family's imprisonment by the Romans. Concurrent with Judah's narrative is the developing Christian story, as Jesus and Judah are natives of the same region and about the same age. Judah survives his ordeal and becomes a famous soldier and charioteer, enabling him to avenge his misfortune. Judah's encounters with Jesus first during Judah's and then during Jesus' suffering lead to the Messiah's curing of Judah's sister and mother of leprosy and Judah's conversion to Christianity. There have been numerous film adaptations including the 1959 version starring Charlton Heston that won ten academy awards. The Robe (1942) by Lloyd C. Douglas was one of the best-selling novels of the 1940s and dramatizes the crucifixion of Jesus from the point of view of Marcellus Gallio, the Roman tribune who commands the garrison that carries out the crucifixion of Jesus. Marcellus winds up in custody of Jesus' robe and converts to Christianity because of his experiences interacting with the robe's magical powers. Like Ben-Hur, The Robe was in 1953 adapted into an Academy Award winning film. In the twentieth century, there began to appear heterodox Bible fiction. Nikos Kazantzakis' The Last Temptation of Christ (1960), caused a widespread outcry and appeared on many banned book lists for its dramatization of Jesus as wracked by temptations, beset by fear, doubts, depression, reluctance and lust. However, Jesus is nevertheless portrayed as a miracle-worker and the son of God who is resurrected following the crucifixion. Norman Mailer's The Gospel According to the Son (1997) is a retelling in Mailer's own words that adheres closely to the Gospel narrative including miracles and resurrection. This was noteworthy in part because Mailer was a Jew, not a Christian. Philip Pullman's The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (2010) is a heavily allegorical retelling of the Christian story that uses postmodern techniques and is an evident polemic against Christianity. It retells the story of Jesus as if he were two people, brothers, \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Christ,\\" with contrasting personalities: Jesus is a moral and spiritual man, and his brother Christ is an ambitious character who wishes to hijack Jesus' biography and legacy to develop a myth that will be the foundation for a powerful and worldly Church. Other works are regarded as heterodox simply because they dramatize the Bible stories realistically, shorn of mythical, miraculous or magical elements. They may even include the transformation from real life events to mythology as part of the narrative. Realist Bible novels are typically semi-historical in that they develop the setting in Israel or Egypt or Rome or as the case may be‚Äîincluding the political and class and racial conflicts and urban and rural landscape imagery‚Äîwith fidelity to known historical facts. As Robert Graves said of his novel King Jesus (1946), \\"I undertake to my readers that every important element in my story is based on some tradition, however tenuous, and that I have taken more than ordinary pains to verify my historical background.\\" Realist Bible novels employ in some way the narratives that comprise the canonical Biblical narrative, but shorn of miracles, or God's explicit presence. With respect to Jesus' biography, Jesus is portrayed as a man, usually a rebel against the wealthy classes (sometimes he himself is born into a privileged background and rebels against his own class), and the ruling Romans and their local client autocrats. Sometimes Jesus' biography is enhanced by sources external to the canonical gospels such as Josephus' chronicles, the Talmud, or non-canonical gospels, and the author's imagination. Graves' King Jesus develops the protagonist as, not the son of God, but rather as a philosopher with a legitimate claim to be the earthly king of the Jews as a descendant of Herod the Great, and the Old Testament's David. The novel has heterodox retellings of Biblical stories. Joseph and His Brothers (1943) is a novel by Thomas Mann that retells the familiar stories of Genesis, from Jacob to Joseph, setting it in the historical context of the Amarna Period. Mann considered it his greatest work. The Red Tent (1997) a novel by Anita Diamant, is a first-person narrative that tells the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and sister of Joseph. Diamont has broadened her character from her minor and brief role in the Bible. The book's title refers to the tent in which women of Jacob's tribe must, as dictated by ancient law, be quarantined while menstruating or giving birth. There the women find mutual support and encouragement from their mothers, sisters and aunts. Pulitzer Prize winner Geraldine Brooks' The Secret Chord (2015) is narrated by Natan, the prophet who communicates God's directives to David. The scriptures are her primary sources for the plot, which includes all the well-known key events: Goliath, David's facility with the harp, kingdom building, Bathsheba, and so on. There are other characters fully developed from Brooks' imagination and portrayed through Natan's point of view. The Testament of Mary (2012) a novella by Colm Toibin, is a retelling of the Christian story from the point of view of Mary, the mother of Jesus. However, she does not believe Jesus is the Son of God ‚Äì she knows he is a man ‚Äì and she is contemptuous of the Gospel writers who visit her to solicit her cooperation and give her food and shelter. The themes or questions that the novel explores are narrative truth and fiction, feminism, loss, identity and corruption thereof, invasion of privacy, and worldly ambition. The Testament of Mary was adapted into a Broadway play. The Liars' Gospel (2012), by Jewish author Naomi Alderman, retells the Christ story from a Jewish perspective. Four witnesses to the key events, Mary, Judas, Caiaphas and Barabbas, are the narrators in four sections of the novel, and the story spans the period from Pompey's siege of Jerusalem in 63 BC through Titus's siege in 70 AD. John the Baptizer (2009), by Brooks Hansen and published by W. W. Norton & Company, is a novelized life of John the Baptist that dramatizes the man beneath the hagiography. According to Christian theology, John was merely a forerunner to Christ, but Hansen's portrait is strongly influenced by the Gnostic teachings that reveal John as a messianic figure at the center of a sect called the Mandeans, and more mature, rigorous and restrained than his younger and charismatic prot√©g√© Jesus. Logos (2015), a novel by John Neeleman and published by Homebound Publications, a small press, and winner of an Independent Publisher Book Awards gold medal for religious fiction and the Utah Book Award for fiction, is a bildungsroman that follows the life and development of the anonymous author of the original gospel. Jacob, a former temple priest in Jerusalem who has been rendered bereft by the Jewish wars and consequent destruction of his family and culture, is inspired by his own autobiography and Paul's mythmaking to create the canonical gospels' original narrative. The Gospel According to Lazarus (2019), a novel by Richard Zimler, expands upon the story of Lazarus of Bethany, who was raised from the dead in the Gospel of John. According to Zimler, one of the objectives of his novel was to return to the New Testament figures their Judaism, so in his narrative, Jesus is called Yeshua ben Yosef and Lazarus is called Eliezer ben Natan. Yeshua and Eliezer have been best friends from childhood, and Yeshua is characterized as a Merkabah mystic. The themes of the book include how we cope with a loss of faith, the terrible sacrifices we make for those we love, the transcendent meaning of Yeshua's mission, and how we go on after suffering a shattering trauma. Reviewing the novel for The Guardian, novelist Peter Stanford called it \\"a brave and engaging novel... a page-turner. I simply had to keep going to the very end in order to know on earth what would happen.\\" See also * Biblical speculative fiction * Theological fiction References Category:Fiction Category:Christian literary genres ","title":"Bible fiction"},{"id":"27004622","text":"Aldo Mazza is an internationally recognized drummer, percussionist and recording artist.

The developer subsequently submitted a planning application to Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council in December 2004 to build an \\"urban village\\" consisting of 650 homes, a children's daycare centre and a business park on the site. The planning application summary claimed: \\"of particular note is the absence of any asbestos contamination\\". However, asbestos containing materials were abundantly visible on the ground, and local residents claimed that there were numerous asbestos dumping sites across the area, and that the woodland there had been heavily contaminated with asbestos dust. Site clearance work had begun as early as May 2004, prior to the submission of the application, including tree felling and soil disturbance, and some waste had been removed on flatbed trailers and open trucks. In September 2005 MMC admitted that the woods were significantly contaminated with asbestos. A campaign group, Save Spodden Valley, was formed to oppose the development, claiming disturbance of the site in a contaminated state posed too great a risk to public health. Greater Manchester Association of Trade Unions Councils said: \\"The planners must do their public duty and deem the site permanently unsafe for urban development and formulate a plan to seal all possible sources of asbestos dust as an urgent priority.\\" The initial planning application was placed on hold in 2005, and Richard Butler, Principal Planning Officer for Rochdale Borough Council said in October 2008: \\"The application has not yet been determined and is suspended whilst the applicants and their consultants, together with our own contamination experts, assess a number of issues, the most important being the asbestos risk and the remediation required as part of the redevelopment.\\" In December 2009, despite no decontamination work having been carried out, the council earmarked the site for 568 houses, based on a housing density of 30 dwellings per hectare, in a draft allocation of future brownfield land targets. In January 2010, however, the council deleted references to the redevelopment of the site. Rochdale parliamentary candidate Simon Danczuk warned that the council believe a housing development on the site is an inevitability and iterated that they are \\"sleepwalking into a catastrophic mistake.\\" MMC have stated that \\"there is no viable alternative to development led remediation of the site.\\" A National Health and Safety Commissioner who was formerly a Health and Safety Manager at the factory has said that the felling of trees and disturbing of soil on the site is \\"sheer madness... With the potential amount of asbestos on that site, no development should be built on this land.\\" Hilda Palmer of the Greater Manchester Hazards Centre has said: \\"Asbestos is a carcinogen and it causes lung diseases. When asbestos gets into the air and can be inhaled by people it can cause those diseases 10, 20, 50 years down the line. So if there is any development on that site there is a potential for serious lung diseases, cancers and death from that development.\\" Spokesman Jason Addy of Save Spodden Valley, stated: \\"The key issue is contamination. Asbestos from this site has killed far too many people already.\\" The planning application was finally officially rejected by Rochdale Council in January 2011. MMC Estates put the land back up for sale in August 2011. As of December 2018, the land was owned by Renshaw Properties, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Background The manufacture of asbestos products began on the site in 1879, and by 1970 the factory had an annual output of 2,250,000 yards of asbestos cloth and of asbestos yarn. The dangerous nature of asbestos fibres had first been suspected in 1898, when Factory Inspector Lucy Deane reported: \\"The evil effects of asbestos dust have also instigated a microscopic examination of the mineral dust by HM Medical Inspector [Thomas Legge]. Clearly revealed was the sharp glass-like jagged nature of the particles, and where they are allowed to rise and to remain suspended in the air of the room in any quantity, the effects have been found to be injurious as might have been expected.\\" In 1924 a 33-year-old Turner's employee, Nellie Kershaw, became the first officially recognised victim of asbestosis but the firm refused to accept responsibility for her death, saying it would \\"create a precedent\\". Her family received no compensation, and she was buried in a pauper's grave in Rochdale. In 1937, Turner's director Robert H. Turner wrote: \\"All asbestos fibre dust is a danger to lungs. If we can produce evidence from this country that the industry is not responsible for any asbestosis claims, we may be able to avoid tiresome regulations and the introduction of dangerous occupational talk.\\" Despite an awareness of the potentially lethal effects of asbestos, the factory site remained heavily contaminated: measurements taken in 1950 and again in 1957 showed levels of asbestos dust in the air outside the factory roof were between 18 and 60 particles per cubic centimetre - far above the company's own safe working level of 2 to 3 particles, while a measurement taken near houses outside the factory premises was 47 particles. In August 1957, Turner's revealed that they were dumping 15,000 lb (6.8 tonnes) of asbestos dust recovered from ventilation filters alone each week. The same document reported that the levels of asbestos dust on the factory's roof exceeded those in the actual production areas inside the factory. In the 1950s people living near the factory joked that the area had frost all year round and the local woods were nicknamed \\"the snow trees\\" due to the permanent dusting with asbestos particles. In 1964 a letter to Turner's directors from solicitors James Chapman & Co admitted: \\"We have over the years been able to talk our way out of claims or compromise for comparatively small amounts, but we have always recognised that at some stage solicitors of experience would, with the advance in medical knowledge and the development of the law, recognise there is no real defence to these claims and take us to trial.\\" By the mid-1970s however the number of asbestos-related deaths began to increase steadily and from 1980 onwards the asbestos market began to decline dramatically. In 1982 the company posted losses of ¬£30million, including compensation payouts of ¬£6million. In 1998, with 263,000 claims for industrial injury pending, Turner's was bought by Federal-Mogul. In 2001, Federal-Mogul filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related claims amounting to $351million. In the United Kingdom the business went into administration in October 2001 leaving a pension fund deficit estimated at ¬£400 million. UK victims of the company's asbestos pollution were offered only a fraction of the compensation to which they were entitled. The weaving and asbestos producing areas of the Spodden Valley site were subsequently demolished in 2001. Land purchase MMC Estates and Rathbone Jersey Limited purchased the site in May 2004, and said: \\"Any successful regeneration must find alternative uses and following discussions with the council, the site was defined as an 'area of opportunity' for a mixed use 'urban village' type development, comprising primarily employment and residential development supported by an appropriate level of ancillary uses. This will be supported by an environmental impact statement. MMC is a local developer responsible for the sympathetic council-backed regeneration of other sites within the borough, and has commenced some clearance works involving the felling of trees which are not protected by tree preservation orders.\\" A Rochdale Council Draft Unitary Development Plan published earlier in the year had accepted that \\"the whole site is contaminated as a result of the industrial processes carried out there\\" and Administrators of Turner's considered the site \\"an asset of dubious value, (possibly even a liability).\\" The Administrators also stated that if mesothelioma or asbestos-related cancer deaths arose from any future development on the site, the liability for this would rest with the new owners and developers of the land. Tree felling Between May 13‚Äì14, 2004 the site was enclosed with temporary mesh fencing and plain-clothed security guards commenced patrols of the public areas. At 02:00 on May 15 bulldozers arrived at the site and tree-felling began at 07:00. The work caused immediate concern to nearby residents who feared the work might unsettle asbestos deposits in the ground. Residents formed the Save Spodden Valley action group the following week. Residents also protested to Rochdale Council, which subsequently issued an emergency tree preservation order on six parts of the site, preventing the removal of trees without permission of planning officers, and carrying a fine of up to ¬£20,000 per tree. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also secured a voluntary arrangement to halt any work that could disturb soil on the site pending soil sampling. Former Turner's employees and local residents claimed that, as recently as the 1960s, asbestos dust and fibres were clearly visible hanging from the trees, and that a disused coalmine shaft exposed by the tree felling had been used over a period of decades to dump hundreds of tonnes of asbestos waste. \\"Rochdale's Chernobyl\\" In November 2004 Rochdale councillor Tom Stott, a former employee at Turner's, warned that any development of the site could be an environmental disaster, and that there could be so much asbestos waste in the ground that serious disturbance could lead to \\"Rochdale's Chernobyl.\\" He also expressed concern that the developers would be allowed by the council to carry out their own contamination survey to determine whether the site was fit for development, which was confirmed by the council: \\"Any developers would have to provide a full environmental assessment of the site as part of their planning application. The council wouldn't be doing any surveys of its own because it doesn't have the expertise or the resources to do this.\\" Urban village plans In December 2004 plans were submitted, in partnership with Countryside Properties, to build an 'urban village' over two-thirds of the site, comprising residential and business developments, a retail site and doctor's surgery. MMC director Mark Russell stated that the plans were in 'everyone's interests' and would be carried out without harming the environment or causing problems with old asbestos: \\"At the end of the day this is a contaminated site with lots of old, ugly, dilapidated buildings on and it needs something doing with it. It is in everyone's interests that this happens. There is not any danger of asbestos.\\" The planning application summary claimed: \\"of particular note is the absence of any asbestos contamination\\". A report submitted by the developers said only one out of the 86 soil tests they carried out showed any traces of asbestos dust, and that traces of lead and copper were more prevalent on the site. A working party of six councillors expressed concern that many areas on the site might have been unchecked, however, and Councillor Elwyn Watkins said that he had personally observed asbestos containing materials hanging on trees when he joined campaigners on the north side of the site. Heavy winds in January 2005 felled several trees, revealing asbestos-like fibres on the exposed roots. Residents eventually had the waste tested themselves at an independent laboratory where it was confirmed to be Amosite (\\"brown asbestos\\"), the most hazardous of the asbestos minerals because of its long persistence in the lungs of exposed people. Sampling controversy In April 2005, following the confirmation of asbestos fibres found on tree roots, the council asked developers to provide more detailed information relating to their contaminated land surveys, and placed the application on hold. They also announced that they were considering appointing their own environmental consultants to examine the site. Jason Addy said: \\"This is what we have been asking for since day one. The information handed in with the planning application was inaccurate, misleading and avoided many issues. As this site begins to reveal more of its murky secrets people are realising just how contaminated it is. We are very concerned about the asbestos contamination on the site. We are very worried about the way this is going, if it wasn't so serious it would be a farce.\\" Rochdale councillor William Hobhouse said: \\"With no government regulations specifying safe levels of asbestos in soil, it is clear the council, working with outside consultants, will have to formulate what percentage of asbestos in the soil is safe.\\" Land audit In May 2005 the Save Spodden Valley group claimed that it had uncovered internal MMC correspondence which identified numerous sites where asbestos fibres had been found in September 2004, predating the planning application. The document stated: \\"The audit undertaken was visual and no samples have been sent away for analysis. I enclose a site map where the asbestos has been located: Top section of road near hair pin bend, asbestos sheets and asbestos fibre found in tree stumps. Road leading to Healey Dell, asbestos cloth.\\" The developers responded that they had been aware of contamination in the northern portion of the site, but their testing report submitted to the council did not include this area as there had been no intention to develop there. Instead they had confined their testing only to those areas where they intended to develop and that there had been \\"some misunderstanding of our intentions and the test result.\\" Health and Safety Executive tests HSE tests on building rubble carried out on the site in March 2005 were revealed in July 2005, and demonstrated the presence of significant contamination. Paul Rowen MP, the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Rochdale, raised the issue and the results in a House of Commons debate on 28 June 2005. He said: \\"At the request of residents, the Health and Safety Commission recently tested rubble from parts of the factory buildings on the site. Of the eight samples tested, three confirmed the existence of asbestos of up to 1%, which is 10 times higher than the proportion ensuring that waste is classed as special waste. Yet in his planning submission, the developer stated: \\"Of particular note is the absence of any asbestos contamination\\"; and in a meeting with local councillors earlier this year, he and his expert witness said that the tests on the rubble had all been negative. For the past 10 months, open wagons have been transporting that rubble around the borough to unknown places, and subject to no control... This case involves a development costing up to ¬£100 million for which the developer has so far paid Rochdale Council a ¬£5,500 planning application fee. For that, the council is expected to carry out all the checks and controls to ensure that the developer is acting honourably.\\" Encia Environmental report In August 2005 a second report commissioned by the developers, from Encia Environmental, revealed levels of asbestos fibres in two soil samples from the site at 1.3% and 2.3%, 13 and 23 times above the limit at which waste is deemed \\"hazardous\\". A level of 3% is categorised as \\"toxic\\". Regarding the developers earlier assertions that they had not intended to develop the controversial northern section, council planning officer Ken Smith claimed that the developers had been told they would have to submit a planning application for the whole of the site, which would have to show any asbestos tests and plans for removal, and not just selected portions. \\"They were clearly told remediation work must take place on the whole of the site,\\" he said. \\"It's been quite clear it was 72 acres and not [just] part of that site.\\" Significant contamination MMC Estates and Countryside Properties subsequently released statements in September 2005 acknowledging that there was significant contamination on the site. Michael Drogan, director of MMC, said: \\"Following the completion of investigations, which have now been published, we recognise there is significant asbestos contamination in areas of the woodland and have evidence of pockets of contamination in other parts of the site.\\" Rochdale councillor Tom Stott responded: \\"In their initial reports they said there was little contamination. Now it is 'significant'. I am shocked that it has taken so long for the companies to admit what we have known for over 12 months.\\" Advertising Standards Authority non-broadcast adjudication A brochure produced by MMC and Countryside Properties, entitled Regeneration of Spodden Valley Community News Autumn 2005, and distributed to 50,000 households in the area, was determined by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to have breached a code of honesty and truthfulness, and was misleading when it claimed: *piles of crushed rubble at the site were \\"free\\" of asbestos *a level of 0.01% asbestos was \\"safe\\" The ASA advised MMC to \\"take greater care when producing marketing communications in future\\", and \\"to ensure that they held full substantation before making similar claims.\\" Atkins Global report The report commissioned from Atkins Global by Rochdale council, at a cost of ¬£80,000, was published in July 2006 and claimed that previous tests on the land, carried out on behalf of the developers, were not thorough enough, and that extensive work would be required before councillors should even consider the controversial planning application. Atkins Global also claimed that the majority of the developers' tests did not detect the true levels of asbestos in the soil. The report concluded that \\"the presence of asbestos cannot be ruled out across much of the site.\\" In June 2007, Countryside Properties withdrew from the joint planning application. MMC released a statement saying: \\"Countryside Properties Ltd has withdrawn from the planning application for a mixed use scheme on the former Turner Brothers site because they became disillusioned with the apparent unwillingness of the town planning department to deal with the application as a result of the ill-founded and negative publicity generated by Jason Addy's campaign. The people of Rochdale should keep in mind that the site owners have not caused the contamination problems on the site. This was inherited from Federal Mogul... If we were to cave in to Jason Addy's uninformed scaremongering and let him have his way, which we most certainly won't, the site would remain a contaminated eyesore on the face of Rochdale in eternity, and all the surrounding houses and properties will be devalued by his badly thought out obsession.\\" As of 2010, the site remains undeveloped and no significant remediation or decontamination work has been undertaken. Implications of the Corby Ruling The ruling in the Corby toxic waste case, delivered in July 2009, found Corby Borough Council liable in negligence, public nuisance and a breach of statutory duty for its reclamation of a steel works and the resulting atmospheric contamination. The case against the council cited: \\"The Defendant's urban land reclamation programme and the presence of poisonous waste presented a significant risk to health. The poisonous waste was ultra hazardous and various sites contained substantial quantities of contaminated waste and toxic materials that were likely to cause personal injuries to persons in the surrounding area in the event of their escape.\\" While recognising that there was insufficient epidemiological data to establish whether the victims' injuries arose from a \\"common cause\\", or from airborne contamination or from the reclamation works, the judge ruled that there was a \\"statistically significant cluster\\" of birth defects in Corby which needed \\"explanation other than chance\\": it was not the court's purpose to establish whether the victims were individually exposed to contaminants from the reclamation, rather to determine whether any relevant breach of duty had the ability to cause injuries of the type complained of. The judge also ruled that it was \\"reasonably foreseeable that the local population might be exposed to hazardous or contaminated substances\\" as a result of the council's clean-up programme. Matt Townsend, head of the environmental practice at Allen & Overy, says: \\"One of the important lessons from the case is that because of the rapidly evolving nature of environmental science and advancing knowledge and techniques, it will no longer be possible for developers to hide behind the science. To claim that you didn‚Äôt know is now unacceptable.\\". Stephen Matthew, a partner in the project group at corporate law firm Nabarro, advises: \\"Councils and regeneration bodies still need to be very open and clear about how they intend to deal with material on brownfield sites. Councils need to take professional advice... Don't leave a gaping hole for any future class actions.\\" Following the Corby ruling, Jason Addy stated: \\"The Corby ruling could have huge implications for the actions and responsibilities of Rochdale Council for the Spodden Valley site. Environmental pollution has been a problem at the Rochdale factory with acknowledged cases of asbestos- related cancer caused by environmental exposure.\\" Laurie Kazan Allen, Editor of the British Asbestos Newsletter, said: \\"This landmark decision has ramifications for Rochdale Council regarding the Spodden Valley asbestos factory site. There is now a clear legal principle that local authorities hold a duty of care to protect communities from the hazardous effects of disturbing contaminated land. Since at least the 1960s there has been clear evidence that the inhalation of asbestos fibres, even in low quantities, can cause terminal cancer decades after initial exposure. Rochdale Council must take heed of this historic decision and act to protect local people.\\" Hilda Palmer of the Greater Manchester Hazards Centre said: \\"This has serious implications for Rochdale MBC in its management and control of the ex T&N; site. The site is known to be extensively contaminated with the known carcinogen asbestos, which may be released into the air whenever the site is disturbed, and the invisible microscopic fibres spread in the air across the area to be inhaled by people, including children who are especially at risk of developing asbestos related terminal cancers such as mesothelioma years later. These facts are not in dispute and though the owner of the site is the responsible duty holder, the court judgment on Corby Council confirms the duty of care of a council as the planning authority and environmental health authority in terms of managing and controlling the risks to long term health presented by the airborne asbestos fibres from this site.\\" See also *Armley asbestos disaster *Corby toxic waste case *Agriculture Street Landfill *Nellie Kershaw ReferencesExternal links *Spodden Valley, Rochdale's asbestos scandal - 1982 TV documentary (part 1) *Spodden Valley, Rochdale's asbestos scandal - 1982 TV documentary (part 2); additional coverage of current controversy added.

Craig (1903‚Äì1997) was an American businessman, writer, soldier, diver, Hollywood stunt man, film producer, and television host. He worked in the commercial surface-supplied diving industry from the 1930s on, and filmed aerial combat over Europe during World War II. He is best known for using film and television to show the United States public the beauties and dangers of Earth's underwater worlds. Early life John D. Craig was born 28 April 1903 in Cincinnati, Ohiohttps://www.fold3.com/image/654214997; WW2 era Selective Service card, completed 15 Feb 1942., one of five sons of a Scots immigrant John Craig. His father was born in Dalry, Scotland in 1868. Because the younger Craig was not given a middle name, he used \\"D.\\" to create a stage name. He took the \\"D\\" from his youngest brother David, born in 1914. John Craig's older brother Tom was born in New York in 1901. The Craig family moved to Long Beach, California, where the boys spent formative years. In the early 1920s, the younger John Craig made his fortune investing in oil wells at Signal Hill, which were successful. They gave him the resources for extensive travel and an independent life. From the mid-1920s through the early 1930s, Craig traveled throughout Asia and Africa, with many harrowing adventures, which he described in his 1938 memoir, Danger Is My Business. On the Pacific Ocean, he and his companions narrowly escaped with their lives when they came across a large band of drug smugglers. In China, when he and his friends were trying to trap tigers, Craig nearly died after being attacked by a tiger that climbed the tree in which he was supposedly safe.Craig, John D. \\"The World's Most Dangerous Job\\", POPULAR MECHANICS, Jun 1936, p. 866 In Timbuktu, he and his friends were suspected by the military of being spies from the French Foreign Legion, and almost arrested. Diving career In 1931, John D. Craig was hired by a Hollywood studio to travel to Cedros Island off the southwestern coast of Baja California, Mexico, to film the sargassum farming industry established by expatriate Japanese. He was surprised to find that the farms were deep underwater on the seabed.John D. Craig, \\"Deep Diving Is Dangerous, But...\\", The Rotarian, February 1938, p. 22 Because he and his crew were ill-equipped for deep-water diving (having only oxygen masks and goggles), Craig had to learn \\"hard-hat\\" diving from the Japanese \\"sargassa\\" farmers, who used decades-old diving equipment. For the next five years, while living on the Pacific coast, Craig worked on modernizing that equipment. At the same time, he hired on as a stunt diver for several movies, notably those of film director W. S. Van Dyke.John D. Craig, \\"Diving Among Sea Killers\\", Popular Mechanics, April 1936, pp. 508-511 In 1936, Craig traveled to Great Britain and Ireland to prepare for underwater filming of an attempt to recover cargo (including possible gold bullion) that had gone down with the RMS Lusitania when it was sunk near the Irish coast in 1915. In 1935, a single British diver had managed to walk the decks of the sunken ship, so, such a salvage operation was considered feasible. But, after several trial runs, the intense sea currents and the cumbersome nature of the half-ton diving suit caused the plans for filming and salvage operations to be abandoned.Teale, Edwin. \\"New Worlds Beneath the Sea\\", Popular Science, October 1937, p. 29 Taylor, Larry \\"Harris\\", PhD. \\"Diving With Gas Mixtures Other Than Air\\" (Helium subsection), Brief History of Mixed Gas Diving website\\"The Lusitania and John D. Craig\\" , Tom Whitely Website While gathering resources for the Lusitania dive, Craig worked extensively with the deep-sea diving expert Max Gene Nohl to perfect the equipment needed for such a deep-sea task. They did much testing in the Great Lakes of the United States. In 1937, Craig, Nohl, the diver Jack Browne, and Edgar End, M.D., co-founded the deep-sea diving equipment company, Diving Equipment and Salvage Company, in Wisconsin. It is now known as DESCO. Craig also participated in scientific research to determine the best mixture of gases for deep sea \\"hardhat\\" diving.\\"History of DESCO\\" , DESCO Corporation website -- the result was a variation of heliox, a mixture of oxygen and helium that enabled divers to avoid the occupational hazard of nitrogen narcosis. In 1938, Craig was part of a salvage team that unsuccessfully tried to find the Mexican crown jewels in a shipwreck off the Virginia coast. He continued to dive and explore the seas of the world throughout his life. In 1960, he worked with the US Navy on underwater sound research. Military career Craig served as an officer in the U. S. Army Air Corps during World War II, in which he specialized in aerial photography. Commissioned as a captain, on April 1, 1942 he appeared on one of the first live television programs commercially broadcast in the United States, WNBT's \\"Thrills and Chills Everywhere\\", which presented \\"dramatizations of some hair- raising experience of an explorer or adventurer.\\"\\"Thrills and Chills Everywhere\\", Status Guide: Television Obscurities website In 1943, Craig headed the 9th Combat Camera Unit of the 6th Air Defence Group in Europe (stationed in Cairo, Egypt). He supplied aerial footage to Hollywood's First Motion Picture Unit, which had been formed in 1942 as the 18th Air Force Base Unit of the U.S. Army Air Corps.\\"First Motion Picture Unit\\", Magic Lantern Video and Book Store Website In 1944 after being promoted to Major, Craig was transferred with his film unit to England to document the D-Day invasion. He flew more than 35 missions in Europe and Africa, and aided in the aerial photography of the Ploesti Raid in 1944. (Some of his B-17 footage was reportedly used in the movie Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and again in the TV series of the same name. Wounded in action late in the war at Remagen Bridge in Germany, Craig was awarded the Purple Heart -- he was also awarded the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with four oak- leaf clusters, and the Distinguished Unit Citation with three clusters for his achievements.Google News Archive: \\"Dinner Club Will Hear Film Photog\\", Spokane Spokesman-Review, September 21, 1951, p. 12 By the end of his military service, Craig had been promoted to Lt.

This aircraft later served with the Royal Flying Corps. Emmanouel Argyropoulos and Nieuport IV.G Alkyon in which he made the first flight in Greece. The Nieuport IV was a French-built sporting, training and reconnaissance monoplane of the early 1910s. Design and development Societe Anonyme des Etablissements Nieuport was formed in 1909 by √âdouard Nieuport. The Nieuport IV was a development of the single-seat Nieuport II and two seat Nieuport III.A. It was initially designed as a two-seat sporting and racing monoplane, but was also bought by the air forces of several countries. It was initially powered by a Gnome Omega rotary engine, which was later replaced by more powerful rotaries.Green, 1965, p.347 Operational history The first Nieuport IVs were built in 1911 and production continued well into World War I in Russia.Sanger, 2002, p.109-111 The design was adopted in small numbers by most air arms of the period, although the Imperial Russian Air Service was the largest user. The IV.G was one of the principal aircraft used by the Imperial Russian Air Service during its formative years, with roughly 300 being produced locally by the Russo-Baltic Wagon Works and Shchetinin in St. Petersburg, and the Dux Factory in Moscow.Davilla, 1997 p.351 Lt. Pyotr Nesterov performed the first ever loop, over Kiev in a model IV.G on 27 August 1913 for which he was placed under arrest for 10 days for \\"undue risk to government property\\" until the feat was repeated in France and he was promoted and awarded a medal.Durkota, 1997, pp.201‚Äì204 The French government equipped a single squadron with Nieuport IV.Ms, Escadrille N12 initially based at Reims, having purchased at least 10. This unit continued to operate Nieuport monoplanes after the start of World War I, slowly replacing them with other types as attrition reduced their numbers.Sanger, 2002, p.77 The Swedish Air Force was presented with a IV.G in 1912 by four individuals, becoming one of the first aircraft of that force, which was later joined by a second IV.G in 1913, and a IV.H transferred from the Swedish Navy.Sanger, 2002, p.157 The Japanese Army operated one IV.G and one IV.M, which were designated as Army Nieuport NG2 aeroplane and Army Nieuport NM aeroplane respectively, with the NG being flown in the Tsingtao campaign in September and October 1914 alongside four Maurice Farman MF.11s.Francillon, 1979, p.48 One of the first batch of aircraft purchased by the British Army's Air Battalion Royal Engineers (the precursor to the Royal Flying Corps) was a Nieuport IV.G and serialed B4. Additional IV.G monoplanes were purchased from private individuals including one from Claude Grahame-White and another from Charles Rumney Samson, plus three others.Sanger, 2002, p.93-95Robertson, 1979, p.18 The Nieuport IVs were in service when the RFC carried out an investigation into monoplane crashes, and while the report covered an accident involving a Nieuport IV, it was the result of improper maintenance resulting in an engine failure, and not a structural failure such as with the Bristol monoplane and Deperdussin monoplane whose structural deficiencies led to the Monoplane Ban. date=February 8, 1913}} Argentina purchased a single IV.G named la Argentina which served with the Escuela de Aviation Militaire.Sanger, 2002, p.154 In Greece a IV.G was bought privately and named Alkyon and after being the first aircraft to fly in Greece, was resold to the government which used it during the First Balkan War in 1912, flying from Larissa. Siam purchased 4 IV.Gs which were used as trainers at Don Muang airfield.Sanger, 2002, p.156 Spain purchased one IV.G and 4 IV.Ms which were used by the Escuala Nieuport de Peu for training before 3 were transferred to an operational Escuela at Tetu√°n which then moved to Zezulan, remaining operational until 1917. Italy's 1st Flottiglia Aeroplani of Tripoli operated several Nieuport IV.Gs during the Italo-Turkish War, one of which became the first aeroplane to be used in combat when it flew a reconnaissance mission against Turkish forces on 23 October 1911.Sanger, 2002, p.131 It narrowly missed out to a Bleriot XI with the same unit for the honor of being the first aircraft to drop a bomb on enemy forces. The pilot who carried out the first mission Capt. Maizo, became one of the first victims of anti-aircraft fire, when he was shot down by an Austrian cannon weeks before the war ended in 1912.

A company that wants to explore international trade without taking on the full responsibilities of cross- border business transactions has the option of forming a joint venture with a foreign partner. International investors entering into a joint venture minimize the risk that comes with an outright acquisition of a business. In international business development, performing due diligence on the foreign country and the partner limits the risks involved in such a business transaction. IJVs aid companies to form strategic alliances, which allow them to gain competitive advantage through access to a partner's resources, including markets, technologies, capital and people. International joint ventures are viewed as a practical vehicle for knowledge transfer, such as technology transfer, from multinational expertise to local companies, and such knowledge transfer can contribute to the performance improvement of local companies. Within IJVs one or more of the parties is located where the operations of the IJV take place and also involve a local and foreign company.  Basic elements  These include: *Contractual Agreement - IJVs are established by express contracts that consist of one or more agreements involving two or more individuals or organizations and that are entered into for a specific business purpose. *Specific Limited Purpose and Duration - IJVs are formed for a specific business objective and can have a limited life span or be long-term. IJVs are frequently established for a limited duration because (a) the complementary activities involve a limited amount of assets; (b) the complementary assets have only a limited service life; and/or (c) the complementary production activities will be of only limited efficacy. *Joint Property Interest - Each IJV participant contributes property, cash, or other properties and organizational capital for the pursuit of a common and specific business purpose. Thus, an IJV is not merely a contractual relationship, but rather the contributions are made to a newly formed business enterprise, usually a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership. As such, the participants acquire a joint property interest in the assets and subject matter of the IJV. *Common Financial and Intangible Goals and Objectives - The IJV participants share a common expectation regarding the nature and amount of the expected financial and intangible goals and objectives of the IJV. The goals and objectives of an IJV tend to be narrowly focused, recognizing that the assets deployed by each participant represent only a portion of the overall resource base. *Shared Profits, Losses, Management, and Control - The IJV participants share in the specific and identifiable financial and intangible profits and losses, as well as in certain elements of the management and control of the IJV.  Reasons for forming  There are many motivations that lead to the formation of a JV (joint venture). They include: *Risk sharing ‚Äì Risk sharing is a common reason to form a JV, particularly, in highly capital intensive industries and in industries where the high costs of product development equal a high likelihood of failure of any particular product. *Economies of scale ‚Äì If an industry has high fixed costs, a JV with a larger company can provide the economies of scale necessary to compete globally and can be an effective way by which two companies can pool resources and achieve critical mass. *Market access ‚Äì For companies that lack a basic understanding of customers and the relationship / infrastructure to distribute their products to customers, forming a JV with the right partner can provide instant access to established, efficient and effective distribution channels and receptive customer bases. This is important to a company because creating new distribution channels and identifying new customer bases can be extremely difficult, time-consuming and expensive activities. *Geographical constraints ‚Äì When there is an attractive business opportunity in a foreign market, partnering with a local company is attractive to a foreign company because penetrating a foreign market can be difficult both because of a lack of experience in such market and local barriers to foreign-owned or foreign- controlled companies. *Funding constraints ‚Äì When a company is confronted with high up-front development costs, finding the right JV can provide necessary financing and credibility with third parties. *Acquisition barriers ‚Äì When a company wants to acquire another but cannot due to cost, size, or geographical restrictions or legal barriers, teaming up with a company in a JV is an attractive option. The JV is substantially less costly and thus less risky than complete acquisitions, and is sometimes used as a first step to a complete acquisition with the JV. Such an arrangement allows the purchaser the flexibility to cut its losses if the investment proves less fruitful than anticipated or to acquire the remainder of the company under certain circumstances. Due diligence Before entering an international joint venture, businesses are advised by business advisers to do a thorough due diligence on the country, the business, and the partner. Due diligence is the investigation of a country, business or person, for the purpose of obtaining useful information on the potential benefits, pitfalls and costs. It helps investors to make better profit and mitigate risk. It includes thorough research about the potential partners through channels like internet, database and media search, establishing each partner's duties and responsibilities, management control, agreeing on splits of returns, exit strategies, contingency plans, etc. International law firms working with businesses who are considering a joint venture will use a due diligence checklist to ensure that it is a sound business development.  Benefits  Many of the benefits associated with international joint ventures are that they provide companies with the opportunity to obtain new capacity and expertise and they allow companies to enter into related business or new geographic markets or obtain new technological knowledge. Furthermore, international joint ventures are in most cases have a short life span, allowing companies to make short-term commitments rather than long-term commitments. Through international joint ventures, companies are given opportunities to increase profit margins, accelerate their revenue growth, produce new products, expand to new domestic markets, gain financial support, and share scientists or other professionals that have unique skills that will benefit the companies.  Structure  International joint ventures are developed when two companies work together to meet a specific goal. For example, Company A and Company B first begin by identifying and selecting an IJV partner. This process involves several steps such as market research, partner search, evaluating options, negotiations, business valuation, business planning, and due diligence. These steps are taken on by each company. There are also legal procedures involved such as IJV agreement, ancillary agreements, and regulatory approvals. Once this process is complete, the IJV Company is formed and during this final procedure the steps taken are formation and management. Structuring IJVs can pose a challenge when parties are from two different cultural backgrounds or jurisdictions Once both parties have come to an agreement on fundamental issues such as commercial nature, scope and mutual objectives of the joint venture, the parties must decide on where, geographically, the venture will take place and what the legal structure for the venture will look like. Most of the time, the structure agreed on will be between different types of corporations, partnerships, or some form of a limited liability company. Limited liability Limited liability allows to limit debts and losses to the assets of the venture and protect the assets of the members themselves from being liable for the venture's debts. In a limited liability partnership (LLP), the partners have limited liability and can be held liable only to the extent of their capital investments. In the U.S., in addition to limited liability partners, the law requires that every limited partnership have at least one general partner who has unlimited liability. The general partner can be held responsible for all the liabilities of the limited partnership. Many ventures resolve this problem by forming a special purpose entity, usually a limited liability company or a corporation, which then acts as the general partner. A joint venture formed as limited liability company (LLC) offers protection to the partners by providing limited liability to all of its members. Unlike a limited liability partnership (LLP), there is no requirement to have a general partner who has unlimited liability and can be held responsible for all the liabilities. Both limited partnerships and limited companies in the U.S. enjoy the advantage of being pass-through entities for U.S. tax purposes. The limited partnership does not pay taxes. Instead, the tax liability of the venture is allocated to the members of the LLP in proportion to their interests in the venture.  Management  There are two types of international joint ventures: dominant parent and shared management. Within dominant parent IJVs, all projects are managed by one parent who decides on all the functional managers for the venture. The board of directors, which is made up of executives from each parent, also plays a key role in managing the venture by making all the operating and strategic decisions. A dominant parent enterprise is beneficial where an international joint venture parent is selected for reasons outside of managerial input. On the other hand, shared management ventures consist of both parents managing the enterprise. Each parent organizes functional managers and executives that will be within the board of directors. In this form of management, there are also two types of shared management ventures. The first type is 50:50 IJV and this is where each partner puts in 50% of the equity in return for 50% participating control. The second type is where both partners can negotiate that not all shared management ventures are 50:50 and that one partner has more than a co-equal role in the IJV.  Finance  When two or more partners get together and form an international joint venture agreement, they must decide early on in regards to what the financial structure will entail as this will aid in management and control. Some of the steps include establishing the capital required to start the IJV, the impact of securing a strong strategic alliance partner, and financial reporting. Once an arrangement is made, a tax- planned joint venture will be created which will aid in maximizing the after- tax returns.  Factors affecting International Joint Ventures = Economic factors  Poor formation and planning Problems that arise in joint ventures are usually as a result of poor planning or the parties involved being too hasty to set up shop. For example, a marketing strategy may fail if a product was inappropriate for the joint venture or if the parties involved failed to appropriately assess the factors involved. Parties must pay attention to several analyses both of the environment and customers they hope to operate in. Failure to do this sets off a bad tone for the venture, creating future problems.A short course in international joint venture by Alan Gutterman Unexpected poor financial performance One of the fastest ways for a joint venture is to fail is financial disputes between parties. This usually happens when the financial performance is poorer than expected either due to poor sales, cost overruns or others. Poor financial performance could also be as a result of poor planning by the parties before setting up a joint venture, failure to approach the market with sufficient management efficiency and unanticipated changes in the market situation. A good solution to this is to evaluate financial situations thoroughly before and during every step of the joint venture. Management problems Another issue that can affect the success of joint ventures is the ineffective blending of managers who are not used to working together or have entirely different ways of approaching issues affecting the organization. Many joint ventures come apart due to misunderstanding over leadership strategies. For a successful joint venture, there has to be understanding and compromise between parties, respect and integration of the strengths of both sides to overcome the weaker points and make their alliance stronger. Inappropriate management structure In a bid to have equal rights in the venture, there could be a misfit of managers. As a result, there is a major slowdown of decision making processes. Daily operational decisions that are best made quickly for more efficiency of the business tends to be slowed down because there is now a ‚Äòcommittee‚Äô that is in place to make sure both parties support every little decision. This could distract from the bigger picture leading to major problems in the long run. Economic environment of IJV The ultimate goal of a successful JV partnership is more customers and a stronger body. To ensure a JV's partnerships are as profitable as possible, it helps to look at them from the customer's point of view. The features a JV partnership should aim to acquire for an effective marketing campaign are both channeling the expertise and strengths of both parties to maximize value for the customers and stakeholders, while downplaying the weaknesses and presenting a united front. Cultures of IJV  When a joint venture is formed, it is an attempt at blending two or more cultures in the hope of leveraging on the strength of each party. Lack of understanding of the cultures of the individual parties poses a problem if not addressed. A common problem in these multi-cultural enterprises is that the culture is not considered in their initial formation. It is usually assumed that the cultural issues will be addressed later when the new unit has been created. Usually, compromises are reached and certain cultural from the parties are kept on while others are others are either out right discarded or modified.  Benefits and Disadvantages for IJV  The joint venture is becoming a popular way for companies that outsource their operations to retain a piece of the ownership pie. The creation of a new legal entity during the launch of a joint venture comes with its share of benefits and Disadvantages.  Benefits of International Joint Ventures  *Joint ventures enable companies to share technology and complementary intellectual property assets for the production and delivery of innovative goods and services.Business Briefing 2009: Trade Policy Available from: http://www.intracen.org/btp/wtn/newsletters/2009/ip_6.htm *For the smaller organization with insufficient finances and / or specialist management skills, the joint venture can prove an effective method of obtaining the necessary resources to enter a new market. This can be especially true in attractive markets, where local contacts, access to distribution, and political requirements may make a joint venture the preferred or even legally required solution. *Joint ventures can be used to reduce political friction and improve local / national acceptability of the company. *Joint ventures may provide specialist knowledge of local markets, entry to required channels of distribution, and access to supplies of raw materials, government contracts and local production facilities. *In a growing number of countries, joint ventures with host governments have become increasingly important. These may be formed directly with State-owned enterprises or directed toward national champions. *There has been growth in the creation of temporary consortium companies and alliances, to undertake particular projects that are considered to be too large for individual companies to handle alone (e.g. major defense initiatives, civil engineering projects, or new global technological ventures). *Exchange controls may prevent a company from exporting capital and thus make the funding of new overseas subsidiaries difficult. The supply of know-how may therefore be used to enable a company to obtain an equity stake in a joint venture, where the local partner may have access to the required funds.  Disadvantages of International Joint Ventures  *A major barrier is that joint ventures are very difficult to integrate into a global strategy that involves substantial cross-border trading. In such circumstances, there are almost inevitably problems concerning inward and outward transfer pricing and the sourcing of exports, in particular, in favor of wholly owned subsidiaries in other countries. *The trend toward an integrated system of global cash management, via a central treasury, may lead to conflict between partners when the corporate headquarters endeavours to impose limits or even guidelines on cash and working capital usage, foreign exchange management, and the amount and means of paying remittable profits. *Another serious problem occurs when the objectives of the partners are, or become, incompatible. For example, the multinational enterprise may have a very different attitude to risk than its local partner, and may be prepared to accept short-term losses in order to build market share, to take on higher levels of debt, or to spend more on advertising. Similarly, the objectives of the participants may well change over time, especially when wholly owned subsidiary alternatives may occur for the multinational enterprise with access to the joint venture market. *Problems occur with regard to management structures and staffing of joint ventures. *Many joint ventures fail because of a conflict in tax interests between the partners.  Disputes and agreements = Disputes  When two or more partners agree on an international joint venture, there are possibilities for disputes to arise. Particularly in IJVs, there can be issues between the partners who are likely to want their home country's governing law and jurisdiction to apply to any disputes that may come up; therefore, to avoid such a problem, a neutral governing law and jurisdiction is chosen in some cases.Cross-border joint ventures-getting the dispute resolution clause right A popular dispute resolution technique used in IJVs is arbitration; however, many times a court process is given priority as this system has more authority. Other dispute resolution strategies utilized are mediation and litigation.  Agreements  Entering into an international joint venture agreement begins with the selection of partners and then generally this process continues to a Memorandum of Understanding or a Letter of Intent is signed by both parties. The Memorandum of Understanding is a document describing an agreement between parties. On the other hand, a Letter of Intent is a document outlining an agreement between the parties before the agreement is finalized. Before signing an IJV, specific aspects of the agreement must be addressed such as applicable law, holding shares, transfer of shares, board of directors, dividend policy, funding, access, confidentiality and termination.  IJV in different countries = China  An IJV is an attractive way to get into Chinese market for businesses that are unfamiliar with the completed culture and the less open market. However, China is becoming more and more global and familiar to the world. As such, IJV is falling out of practice because of the practical difficulties in picking a proper partner, management, technology transfer, profit sharing and so on. There are two main types of IJV in China: Equity Joint Ventures and Cooperative Joint Ventures. = Equity joint ventures (EJVs) = An equity joint venture is a partnership between an overseas and a Chinese individual, enterprises or financial organizations approved by the Chinese government.Chinese Market Companies in an equity joint venture share both mutual rewards, risks and losses according to the ratio of investment. A minimum of 25% the capital must be contributed by the foreign partners, and no minimum investment for the Chinese partners. A joint venture is free to hire Chinese nationals without the interference from government employment industries by abiding Chinese Labor Law, and purchase land, build their own buildings, and privileges prevented to representative offices. = Cooperative joint ventures (CJVs) = CJVs are a rather unevenly regulated form of IJV between Chinese and foreign-based companies. They are usually found in venture, which are both technology-based and have a substantial requirement for fixed assets, for example infrastructure and volume manufacturing.What is a cooperative joint venture? No minimum foreign contribution is required to initiate cooperative ventures, and the contributions made by the investors are not necessarily expressed in a monetary value. These contributions can include excluded in the equity joint venture process can be contributed such as labor, resources, and services.How to establish a cooperative joint venture in China Greater flexibility in the structuring of a cooperative venture is also permissible including the structure of the organization, management, and assets.  Turkey  International joint ventures have played a significant role in the reform and liberalization of the laws governing foreign investors as part of Turkey's economic program adopted after 2001. Turkey lies on the borders between Europe and Asia and is used as a way to achieve strategic goals to enter into the Asian or European market, which is important for those wanting to enter EU market since Turkey signed the European Customs Union (ECU). The Turkish Accounting Standards Board requires that all enterprises established under the Turkish Commercial Code in Turkey must prepare statutory financial statements in compliance with the Turkish Accounting Standards Board, which makes all accounting data transparent and more reliable for all parties involved. Under Turkish Law, a joint venture may be formed under two ‚Äòumbrellas‚Äô: Commercial Company, governed by the Turkish Commercial Code or Ordinary Company, Governed by the Turkish Code of Obligations.  Examples of successful IJVs = Aera Energy  Aera Energy covers a large area of California. The state's leading oil and gas producer (accounting for 30% of California's total production), Aera Energy's properties extend from the Los Angeles Basin in the south to Coalinga in the north. It has daily production of 165,000 barrels of oil and 50 million cubic feet of natural gas and boasts proved onshore and offshore reserves of 800 million barrels of oil equivalent. Aera Energy also has interests in real estate operations (in partnership with homebuilder Toll Brothers). The exploration and production company is a joint venture of affiliates of Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Omega Navigation Enterprises Inc. Omega Navigation Enterprises Inc. is an international provider of marine transportation services focusing on seaborne transportation of refined petroleum products. One of the vessels, namely the Omega Duke, is owned through a 50% controlled joint venture with Topley Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore International AG. They have also formed an equal partnership joint venture company with Topley Corporation, namely Megacore Shipping Ltd.  Japan Nuclear Fuel Co., Ltd. (JNF)  Japan Nuclear Fuel Co., Ltd. (JNF), the predecessor of Global Nuclear Fuel ‚Äì Japan Co., Ltd. (GNF-J), started operation in Kurihama in 1967 as a nuclear fuel manufacturing joint venture among General Electric Company (US), Toshiba Corporation and Hitachi Limited. Since it began supplying the first domestically produced nuclear fuel in 1971, GNF-J, a pioneer nuclear fuel manufacturer, has delivered more than 70,000 fuel bundles to various nuclear power plants across the country and contributed to the stable supply of energy in Japan. On January 1, 2000, the sales, design and development operations were transferred from the three joint venture partners to JNF, and JNF made a new start as a GE group company, later changing its name to GNF-J, by offering core management services as well as handling MOX fuel design and quality control.

The weather was virtually clear with ceiling unlimited. The wreckage was located three miles (4.8 km) east of Silver Crown. The aircraft struck the ground in a shallow descent just below a small knoll. Marks on the ground made by the propellers, fuselage, and engine showed the aircraft was in a normal flight attitude. Propeller marks and engine damage established the engines were developing normal power and the aircraft was at cruising speed. An untouched knoll 60 feet (18 m) further back on the flight path and three feet (0.9 m) higher established that the aircraft was descending. The pilot was believed to be flying on instruments. The probable cause was determined to be pilot error in failing to monitor altitude or location.

Located west of the City of Fairfax in an unincorporated area of the County, it is the meeting place of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, as well as housing the offices of the Fairfax County Executive and his deputies.\\"Facilities & Locations .\\" Fairfax County. Retrieved on April 4, 2009. History and development In 1969, the Fairfax County Government moved its offices into the newly constructed 12-story County Governmental Center on the county's exclave in the City of Fairfax. Designed by the architectural firm of Vosbeck, Vosbeck, Kendrick and Redinger and built by Blake Construction, the building was renamed the Massey Building in March 1971 to honor the county's first county executive, Carlton C. Massey. Within a decade, however, it became apparent that the Massey Building was no longer sufficient as a governmental center, and in 1977 the county appointed a citizens' committee to consider moving the county's centralized activities out of the City of Fairfax. In October 1978, the committee recommended a site west of Fairfax, and in 1979, the county purchased 183 acres of the site, called the Smith-Carney site, for $4.1 million. Another committee reported on county agency space needs in 1980, and in 1982 a design team and concept were selected. At this point, development stalled, because the Board of Supervisors did not want to put a bond issue to pay for the new government center to a voter referendum, preferring to reserve the county's bond financing capacity for other needs. In 1985, the Board of Supervisors initiated a scheme whereby they could have their new government center free or on the cheap as part of a joint public-private partnership. The land which the county had purchased in 1979 for $4.1 million had ballooned in value to $42 million, and the county proposed swapping some of this valuable land in exchange for construction of the new government center. After years of negotiation, the county in 1987 entered into an agreement with a joint partnership of the Charles E. Smith Company and the Artery Organization whereby the county gave Smith/Artery 50 acres of land for residential development, conveyed for 75 years 67 acres of land for commercial development, and paid Smith/Artery $27.3 million. The agreement with Smith/Artery was not without controversy, with accusations that Smith/Artery had obtained a lucrative deal with the county and that the county was giving away too much in the deal. Even before the sprawling complex was completed, it had been dubbed the \\"Taj Mahal\\" by its critics and opponents. The name was applied due to the intent to install features that were perceived as luxuries, including a $400,000 12-story steel obelisk (later cancelled), a custom-built granite conference table, Brazilian mahogany paneling, and private elevators for the members of the Board of Supervisors during a time of constrained budgets due to the recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Current uses Naturalization ceremonies are also held at the center, as well as flu shot distribution and many other bureaucratic functions.

She was the eldest daughter of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, and his wife, Philippine Charlotte of Prussia, sister of Frederick the Great. Life=George, Prince of Wales The future George III of the United Kingdom, c. 1751. In 1753, George II of Great Britain hoped to marry Sophie Caroline to his grandson George, Prince of Wales (the future George III).Black (2007), p. 229.Hibbert, pp. 31-32. This was an attempt to improve relations with Prussia, as Sophie Caroline was a niece of Frederick II of Prussia and George II needed Prussian troops to help offset the alliance between France and Austria that had occurred as a result of the Diplomatic Revolution. The prince's mother Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales, thwarted George II's plans, however, which increased tensions within the British royal family. The Prince of Wales himself, influenced by his mother, was vehemently opposed to the match, declaring he would not be \\"bewolfenbuttelled\\". Augusta wanted her son to marry her niece Frederica, but this union also fell through. Soon after becoming king in 1760, George III married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz instead the following year, in what was to become a happy marriage. George and his mother's refusal also reflected another changing reality in British foreign policy: the relationship with the Electorate of Hanover. George II and his father George I were both descended from the House of Hanover, and thus held the electorate very dear to their hearts. As a daughter of the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, Sophie Caroline was ancestrally related to neighboring Hanover; good relations between the electorate and its neighbors were vital to its continuing security, particularly when another war was soon expected.Black (2006), p. 19. The Prince of Wales and his mother however did not possess the same attachment to Hanover, thus influencing their decision to reject a match with Sophie Caroline. Though this match was not to be, Sophie Caroline's brother Charles II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, married George's sister Princess Augusta in 1764, and George III's son George IV married their daughter Caroline of Brunswick, thus continuing the close ties between the two houses. Marriage In Brunswick on 20 September 1759, 11 months after the death of his first wife Princess Wilhelmine of Prussia (Sophie Caroline's aunt), Sophie Caroline married Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. He was 26 years older than she was, and their marriage was childless. Frederick did have a daughter, Margravine Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie of Brandenburg- Bayreuth, from his first marriage; the girl was only five years younger than Sophie Caroline. Frederick died on 26 February 1763. Without any male issue, he was succeeded on his death by his uncle, Frederick Christian. Sophie Caroline died on 22 December 1817 at the age of 80.

Reilly as Dr. Steve Brule. The show is a spin-off of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, originating in a segment called Brule's Rules. The series premiered on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim, on May 16, 2010. The program parodies 1980's public-access television programs and follows Brule as he examines different facets of living. His extreme, possibly pathological, naivete and social awkwardness generally land him in embarrassing situations, though he largely remains ignorant of any embarrassment he's causing himself. As the series progresses, he reveals shocking and sometimes horrifying details about his past and personal life. The series has completed four seasons of six episodes each. In the series Reilly interviews real people, whose reactions are genuine according to executive producer Tim Heidecker. He states that he intends for the humor to derive from Brule's character rather than the reactions of his guests. In post-production, the video is piped through a VCR to simulate poor production value. Critical reception has been positive, with several reviewers highlighting the character of Brule while noting the aesthetic qualities as similar to other productions. The A.V. Club Brandon Nowalk compared it to The Day Today and Brass Eye, while DVD Verdict Dawn Hunt compared it to This Is Spinal Tap. The first two seasons were combined onto a single DVD release, made available on October 16, 2012 in Region 1. Synopsis The program, a surreal parody of human interest shows, follows Brule as he examines (or \\"checks out\\") different facets of living. His severe na√Øvet√© and social awkwardness generally land him in embarrassing situations, though he personally seems impervious to embarrassment. Each episode begins with a poem or lyric pertaining to the subject of the show. Dr. Steve Brule credits the work, usually mispronouncing the author's name; his mispronunciations are a staple of the show‚Äîin the first episode, he mispronounced the name of nutritionist Dr. Johnny Bowden both as \\"Dr. Jimmy Brungus\\" and \\"Dr. Jungy Brogan\\". As the series progresses, he reveals shocking, and sometimes horrifying details about his past and personal life, such as his mother revealing that she would poison his food when he was a child to \\"slow him down.\\" The series also has interludes from other public-access hosts; recurring characters names of Terry Bruge-Hiplo (Robert Axelrod), Doug Prishpreed (Doug Foster), Carol Krabit (Carol Kraft), and Scott Clam (Scott Stewart). Respectively, they host movie reviews, news updates, fortune-telling & weather updates, and a finance show, all in the same style of low-budget cable access segments. To simulate the poor quality of the video, the editors pipe their footage through a videocassette recorder (pictured) and hit the machine to simulate a jump in the vertical synchronization. Production According to executive producer Tim Heidecker, Reilly interviews real people, with their reactions in the series being genuine. He stated that the humor revolves around \\"not necessarily fooling these people. It's more the character of Steve Brule being completely clueless and a really strange guy.\\" Heidecker has also cited Huell Howser and his show California's Gold as an influence.Tim Heidecker's Office Hours Live episode 116. July 4th Tribute to America with Larry Charles and Megan Koester Heidecker also stated that Brule's dialog for the series is mostly improvised. During an interview for Esquire, Reilly was asked about his experiences on the show. Although Reilly did not mind answering the question, he preferred not to elaborate on his character Steve Brule. He stated, \\"his persona would be more interesting if left a mystery\\", and felt the more he would elaborate on Brule's character the less interesting it would become to him. To achieve the artifact-ridden quality of the video, the editors pipe their footage through a videocassette recorder; the post- production crew literally hit the recorder in order to simulate a jump in the vertical synchronization. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Heidecker elaborated on the aesthetic quality of the series: \\"It's a show that genuinely feels like this guy made it himself. It‚Äôs as if it's 4:30 in the morning he had snuck into the studio to make this show without getting permission. It's bare bones. Lots of technical problems. Just a mess. The whole thing is a big mess. A big beautiful mess.\\" Episodes The series has completed four seasons with six episodes each. The first season premiered on May 16, 2010 in the United States; it concluded on June 20, 2010. The second season premiered on March 18, 2012 in the United States; its season finale aired on April 22, 2012. The third season premiered on February 27, 2014 and concluded on April 4, 2014. Adult Swim, in an announcement made before its upfront presentation, revealed Check It Out! to be a returning show for its 2015-16 schedule in May 2016. The fourth season premiered June 18, 2016. and concluded on July 29, 2016. A 30-minute special entitled Bagboy aired on February 20, 2015. A special episode depicting recurring character Scott Clam hosting in place of Brule (as a result of the events of the season 4 finale), aired on October 23, 2017. Critical reception The series has garnered positive critical reception; Ross Luippold of The Huffington Post gave the series a positive review; he noted Reilly's performance, stating he \\"may be the only actor alive who can get away with starring in critically acclaimed films during Oscar season ... while concurrently starring in two Tim & Eric joints.\\" Lindsay Hurd of The Michigan Daily highlighted the stage design in her review; she stated \\"The show's set is just as amusing as Brule's lack of coherence ... [the series] amounts to a gaudy-but-comical set that oddly matches Brule's reporting style.\\" Casey Burchby of DVD Talk \\"highly recommended\\" the series' first and second DVD release. He praised the eponymous character, stating \\"John C. Reilly's Dr. Steve Brule is one of the most likable characters in recent TV history.\\" While he praised the series as \\"a rare example of a well- developed and justified spinoff\\", he found the series best enjoyed \\"parceled out one at a time\\". The series has received positive critical reception from The A.V. Club; the site has graded the first season three As, two Bs and one C grade. Writing for the site, Brandon Nowalk felt the interviews for the second-season finale \\"Life\\" accentuates \\"a different facet\\" of the series' humor: \\"1990s absurdism.\\" He cited The Day Today and Brass Eye as two examples of this quality, while stating Brule's character is closer to Harry S. Plinkett than of Stephen Colbert or Sacha Baron Cohen. He later regarded its third season as \\"a little lighter on the laughs than usual\\", but found it \\"slightly better produced\\", with the audience \\"growing accustomed to the usual blunders.\\" In reviewing the first and second season D.V.D. release, Luke Bonanno of DVDizzy praised Reilly's character; however, he was critical of reprising the \\"bold characters\\" of Wayne and Jan Skylar from Awesome Show, stating that \\"such [characters] just aren't a good fit here and weigh down on the humor.\\" He panned the network's lack of promotion for the series and wished for more episodes per season \\"even if making it with Tim and Eric had to be a creatively-liberating blast\\".

Mow managed to obtain a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 1962. After graduation, Mow decided to pursue a Ph.D. degree at Rensselaer in applied mechanics and applied mathematics. In his thesis he developed a perturbation mathematical method to predict secondary vortex flows in polymeric fluids. Five Mow brothers (Van, Maurice, Donald, Harry and William, founder of Bugle Boy Industries, a clothing manufacturer) received a total of 3 Ph.D. degrees in mechanics and applied mathematics, one bachelor's degree each in architecture and electrical engineering from RPI.RPI Alumni Magazine, Summer 2005  Career  Following his doctoral graduation in 1966, Mow went on for a postdoctoral fellowship in applied mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University with Joseph B. Keller. One year later, he joined the Applied Mechanics and Mathematics Group at Bell Labs working on computer programs for U.S. sonar detection of submarines off the East Coast of America. He returned to RPI in 1969 as Associate Professor of Applied Mechanics. In 1976, he was promoted to the rank of Professor, and received a visiting scientist position at the Skeletal Research Laboratory of Harvard Medical School with Melvin J. Glimcher. The following year, to broaden his prospective, Mow received the coveted NATO Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship to visit eight European countries each with universities with noted research in bioengineering. In 1982, Mow was awarded the John A. Clark and Edward T. Crossan Endowed Chair Professorship in Engineering from Rensselaer. Mow moved to Columbia University in the city of New York in 1986 as the Anne Y. Stein Endowed Chair professor in Mechanical Engineering and Orthopaedic Bioengineering. There he started to work on new ways to map joints, such as the knee, shoulder and wrist, for surgical precision. \\"Experimental Technology Maps Joints for Surgical Precision,\\" New York Times, January 17, 1989 In December 1995, he received an invitation from Executive Vice Provost Michael M. Crow and Provost Jonathan R. Cole, to lead the formation of a new Department of Biomedical Engineering (DBME) at Columbia University and became the inaugural Chair from 2000 to 2010. Following a highly public dispute with the Dean of the Engineering School, during which he called Dean Feniosky Pe√±a-Mora a \\"control freak\\", Mow stepped down from his position in 2011.\\"Discord Over Dean Rocks Columbia Engineering School,\\" New York Times, December 8, 2011, p.

Born in San Francisco, California to an affluent family, Conrad was raised in Hillsborough. He spent a year at the Cate School in Carpinteria, California before being sent east and graduating from the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut in the class of 1940.Profile, cate.org; accessed September 13, 2015.Obituary, nytimes.com, February 17, 2013; accessed September 13, 2015. He attended the University of North Carolina, where he was captain of the freshman boxing team. He also studied painting at the University of Mexico, where he also became interested in bullfighting. After being injured in the bullring, he returned to college and graduated from Yale University in 1943. He wanted to join the Navy after Yale, but his bullfighting injury prevented that. Conrad was American Vice Consul to Seville, M√°laga, and Barcelona from 1943-46. While in Spain, he studied bullfighting with Juan Belmonte, Manolete, and Carlos Arruza. In 1945 he appeared on the same program with Belmonte and was awarded the ears of the bull. He is the only American male to have fought in Spain, Mexico and Peru. After his stint in Spain, he moved for a time to Lima, Peru. He was known as \\"El Ni√±o de California\\" (\\"The California Kid\\"). In 1947, he worked as secretary to famed novelist Sinclair Lewis. Conrad published his first novel, The Innocent Villa, in 1948. It largely went unnoticed, but his second novel, Matador, sold 3,000,000 copies.Chawkins, Steve (February 16, 2013). \\"Barnarby Conrad Jr. dies at 90; bullfighter, artist, saloonkeeper founded Santa Barbara Writers Conference\\", nytimes.com; accessed September 13, 2015. John Steinbeck selected Conrad's Matador as his favorite book of the year, and the novel has been translated into 28 languages. Royalties from Matador provided Conrad with the capital to open El Matador nightclub in San Francisco in 1953. Herb Caen, noting that Matador was the publisher's suggested alternative to the original title Conrad had given his second novel, commented on Conrad naming his nightclub after his first best seller: \\"Who'd ever go eat at a restaurant called Day of Fear?\\" In 1997 Conrad wrote Name Dropping: Tales From My San Francisco Nightclub, \\"a jaunty account\\" about the 10 years he ran El Matador. In 1958, Conrad was gored, almost fatally in a bullfight that was part of a charity event. After learning of the incident, Eva Gabor is said to have run into No√´l Coward at Sardi's in New York and asked him, \\"Did you hear about poor Barnaby? He was terribly gored in Spain.\\" Coward replied, \\"Oh, thank heavens. I thought you said he was bored.\\" Conrad served as a Golden Gate Awards juror at the 1959 San Francisco Film Festival. In 1965 he joined the Festival board and served for five years. Conrad started the Santa Barbara Writers Conference in 1973 at the Cate School, inviting such well-known authors as Eudora Welty, Gore Vidal, Joan Didion and Ross Macdonald. He and his wife Mary directed the literary gathering until Conrad sold the conference in 2004. His son, Barnaby Conrad III, is also a San Francisco-based writer. Conrad's charcoal portraits of Truman Capote and James Michener hang in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. In 2006, the Spanish writer Salvador Guti√©rrez Sol√≠s published his biography, Barnaby Conrad, A Spanish Passion (Fundaci√≥n Jos√© Manuel Lara), which tells the story of Conrad's life in Spain and his connection with the world of bullfighting. Death Conrad died on February 12, 2013 at his home in Carpinteria, California. He had been in hospice care for three weeks. He was 90 years old.

He was remembered for being the founder of Gibraltar's first hospital, which subsequently became the old St Bernard's Hospital. Early life Juan Mateos was a Spanish innkeeper from Gibraltar. He ran an inn at Albalate, in Gibraltar's municipal area, the Campo de Gibraltar. In his youth he was active in defending Gibraltar against the 1540 raid of the corsairs from the Barbary Coast and became famous when he took part in the resistance of one of their landings, killing one of the Berber leaders.(L√≥pez de Ayala, 257) Mateos later took advantage of his reputation becoming a successful merchant, amassing a considerable amount of money. He later became the official \\"Dispenser of Royal Licences\\", therefore having many opportunities to increase his fortune.(Montegriffo, 552) Gibraltar's first hospital Map of Gibraltar in 1627, by Luis Bravo de Acu√±a: 1- Puerta de Espa√±a (now Landport Gate) 2- Castillo (Moorish Castle) 3- Hospital de San Juan de Dios (the old St Bernard's Hospital) 4- Plaza Mayor (now John Mackintosh Square) 5- Iglesia parroquial de Santa Mar√≠a la Coronada y San Bernardo (now the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned) 6- Calle Real (now Main Street 7- Puerta de √Åfrica (now Southport Gates) 8- Muelle Viejo (Old Mole) The Civil Hospital on the site of Mateos' home. This remained Gibraltar's main hospital for almost four and a half centuries until its move in 2005. In 1567 Mateos suddenly changed his way of life by converting his large house in the Upper Town, on the slopes of The Rock, into a 20-bed infirmary, and putting all his fortune towards running the hospital. It was the result of seeing the difficult situation of the poor sick people in the town, and also of the miserable sight of the many ill sailors that arrived in Gibraltar after returning from the New World (many of whom suffered from a virulent form of syphilis, a disease that had had its European outbreak just a century before with ineffective treatment). Mateos' spent almost nothing on himself wearing only sackcloth and eating frugally. He just retained a small room in his former house for himself. For twenty four years, Mateos devoted his time and personal services in support of the charitable institution he had founded. When his fortune was over and he run into debt, he began to beg asking for alms to keep the hospital running. He became well known in the surrounding countryside, with patients coming to him from far and wide. Mateos eventually earned himself a saintly reputation. In 1591, the Bishop of C√°diz, Garc√≠a de Haro, travelled to Gibraltar (which belonged to the diocese of C√°diz at the time) to pay a visit to Mateos and his renowned foundation.(Montegriffo, 553) However, he found him so weak and tired \\"in consequence of much work and fasting\\" that he had to ask the \\"Orden de San Juan de Dios\\" () from Granada (a religious order devoted to the medical care or poor sickmen) to look after the hospital, which begun to be known as the Hospital de San Juan de Dios (). The friars later built a convent and a church close to the hospital. Mateos joined the order himself, maintaining his activities at the hospital, though to a lesser extent. He died three years later, in 1594. He was mourned by all Gibraltar locals and honoured with masses and religious ceremonies for several days after his death. He was buried by the altar of the parish church of St. Mary the Crowned (now the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned). The hospital, however, did not disappear along with its founder but continued to not only serve Gibraltar's population, but also the sick for miles around. This was to remain Gibraltar's main hospital until its move in 2005.

The main idea of these methods is to capture the connectivity of a geometrically complex high-dimensional space by constructing a graph of local paths connecting points randomly sampled from that space. A roadmap G = (V,E) is a directed graph. Each vertex v is a randomly sampled conformation in C. Each (directed) edge from vertex vi to vertex vj carries a weight Pij , which represents the probability that the molecule will move to conformation vj , given that it is currently at vi. The probability Pij is 0 if there is no edge from vi to vj. Otherwise, it depends on the energy difference between conformations. Stochastic roadmap simulation is used to explore the kinetics of molecular motion by simultaneously examining multiple pathways in the roadmap. Ensemble properties of molecular motion (e.g., probability of folding (PFold), escape time in ligand-protein binding) is computed efficiently and accurately with stochastic roadmap simulation. PFold values are computed using the first step analysis of Markov chain theory.

In 2016, Mars co-founded the production team Shampoo Press & Curl, who replaced The Smeezingtons on the composition of his third studio album, the R&B-focused;, 24K Magic. The record received seven Grammy Awards, winning the major categories of Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year. The album also yielded the successful singles \\"24K Magic\\", \\"That's What I Like\\", and \\"Finesse\\". Mars has sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has released seven number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 since his career launched in 2010, attaining his first five faster than any male artist since Elvis Presley. As a songwriter, he was included in Music Week and Billboard magazine as one of the best songwriters of 2011 and 2013, respectively. Mars has received several awards and nominations, including 11 Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, nine American Music Awards, 10 Soul Train Awards and holds three Guinness World Records. He has appeared in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and Forbes magazine's lists of '30 under 30' in 2013, and Celebrity 100 in 2014, 2018 and 2019. Life and career=1985‚Äì2003: Early life and musical beginnings Peter Gene Hernandez was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette San Pedro Bayot, and was raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu. His father is of half Puerto Rican and half Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Ukraine and Hungary), and is originally from Brooklyn, New York. His mother emigrated from the Philippines to Hawaii, and was of Filipina, and some Spanish, ancestry. His parents met while performing in a show in which his mother was a hula dancer and his father played percussion. At the age of two, he was nicknamed \\"Bruno\\" by his father because of his resemblance to professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino. Mars is one of six children and came from a musical family which exposed him to a diverse mix of music genres, including reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&B.; His mother was both a singer and a dancer, and his father performed Little Richard rock and roll music. Mars' uncle was an Elvis impersonator, and also encouraged three-year-old Mars to perform on stage. Mars performed songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. At the age of four, Mars began performing five days a week with his family's band, The Love Notes, and became known in Hawaii for his impersonation of Elvis Presley. When he was five he peed himself during a performance of Elvis' \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" (1961), which led his parents to think they could be making a mistake. However, Mars never waivered. In 1990, Mars was featured in the Hawaiian tabloid shopper MidWeek as \\"Little Elvis\\" and performed in the halftime show of the 1990 Aloha Bowl. In 1992, he appeared in a cameo role in the film Honeymoon in Vegas and was interviewed by Pauly Shore on MTV. When Mars was six years-old, he was featured on The Arsenio Hall Show and throughout grade school, he performed with his family's band, two shows a night, covering Frankie Lymon and Little Anthony, as well. When he was a child he had a small version of a drum set, guitar, piano and some percussion and learned to play the instruments. By age 12, his parents divorced, thus ending The Love Notes act. His father's various businesses, that ranged from temporary-tattoo parlor to memorabilia shops, failed. Consequently, there was no longer a steady source of income. He moved out of his parents' house along with his brother and father. They lived in the \\"slums of Hawaii\\", on the back of a car, on rooftops, and in an abandoned bird zoo, Paradise Park, where Mars' father worked before it closed. The singer had to move to a new schools and initially he was bullied, but he became popular in his last school days. Nevertheless, the time Mars spent impersonating Presley had a major impact on his musical evolution and performing techniques. He later began playing guitar after being inspired by American rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix. In 2010, he also acknowledged his Hawaiian roots and musical family as an influence, explaining: \\"Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments... I've just been surrounded by it.\\" When he attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu he sang in a group called The School Boys, who did several shows including opening for Mars' father new band. The singer, while in high school, passed for the big time of Hawaiian entertainment, becoming the opening gig for a huge magic show and impersonating Michael Jackson in a celebrity-impersonators show, making $75 for performance. After Mars' sister in Los Angeles, California played his demo for Mike Lynn, (the head of A&R; at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment record label), Lynn summoned Mars to Los Angeles. In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career. At that time, he lived on Mansfield Avenue and was surprised by the poverty and squalor of the neighborhood. He adopted his stage name from the childhood nickname his father gave him, adding \\"Mars\\" at the end because: \\"I felt like I didn't have [any] pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I‚Äôm out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars.\\" Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also an effort to \\"avoid being stereotyped\\", as the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latin artist. They even tried to convince Mars to sing in Spanish. 2004‚Äì2010: Production work and It's Better If You Don't Understand Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Mars signed a record contract with Motown Records in 2004, but the deal \\"went nowhere\\", leading him to have a conversation with will.i.am's management, which also turned out to be fruitless. However, the singer's experience with Motown proved to be beneficial to his career. Songwriter Philip Lawrence was also signed to the label. After Mars was dropped by the label less than a year after being signed, he stayed in Los Angeles and landed a music publishing deal in 2005 with American record producer Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent. Lindsey showed Mars and fellow songwriters Brody Brown and Jeff Bhasker (who Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music and acted as a mentor, helping them to hone their craft. Bhasker explained that Lindsey would \\"mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, because you can have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline.\\" Lindsey confessed he \\"held Mars back for five years while they learned an extensive catalog of hit music.\\" In a different interview Brown corroborated the former story. During this time, Mars played cover songs around Los Angeles in a band called Sex Panther with Bhasker and Eric Hernandez (Mars' brother), who eventually became the drummer of Mars' main band, The Hooligans. When Philip Lawrence was first told he should meet Mars he was reluctant to do so since he did not even have money for bus fare. Keith Harris, drummer for the American musical group The Black Eyed Peas, told Lawrence: \\"Whatever it costs you to get out here, I'll reimburse you.\\" Lawrence responded: \\"Just give me five dollars back for the bus.\\" The pair began collaborating, writing songs for Mars, but they received many rejections from record labels. On the verge of giving up, they received a call from Brandon Creed, who was looking for songs for a reunited Menudo. He liked their song \\"Lost\\", which was written for Mars. The duo did not want to give the song away, but when they were offered $20,000 for it, they agreed. The sale of this song allowed them to continue working, and Mars and Lawrence decided that they would write and produce songs together for other artists. Eventually, Creed became Mars' manager for nine years. In 2006, Lawrence introduced Mars to his future A&R; manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck. After hearing him play a couple of songs on the guitar, Bay- Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt it was too early and that he still needed to develop as an artist. Before becoming a successful solo artist, Mars was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for the likes of Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, Sean Kingston, and Flo Rida. He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song \\"Get Sexy\\" (2009) and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7 (2010). His first recorded appearance as a singer was on Far East Movement's second studio album, Animal, on the track \\"3D\\" (2009). He was also featured on American pastor and hip hop artist Jaeson Ma's debut single \\"Love\\" in August 2009 and on Travie McCoy's \\"One at a Time\\" (2009), a charity single for MTV's Staying Alive foundation. He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on, and composing (as part of the production group The Smeezingtons) B.o.B's \\"Nothin' on You\\" (2009) and Travie McCoy's \\"Billionaire\\" (2010); both songs peaked within the top ten of various music charts, with the former charting at number one on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. Mars said of these successful singles: \\"I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of \\"Nothin' on You\\", it might've sounded like some '90s R&B.;\\" Then, on May 11, 2010, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand. The EP peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200 US albums chart and a music video was released for the song \\"The Other Side\\" featuring CeeLo Green and B.o.B. Mars, under The Smeezingtons, composed Green's single \\"Fuck You\\" (2010). 2010‚Äì2012: Doo- Wops & Hooligans Bruno Mars playing the keyboard in a concert in Houston, Texas in 2010 After serving as guest vocalist on B.o.B's and Travie McCoy's singles, Mars released \\"Just the Way You Are\\" on July 20, 2010. The song was the lead single from his debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010), and reached number one in the US, Canada, the UK, and several other countries. The song holds the record as the longest-reigning debut adult contemporary format hit, spending twenty weeks atop the Adult Contemporary chart in the United States. Mars also released two promotional singles, \\"Liquor Store Blues\\" featuring Damian Marley and \\"Grenade\\", before confirming the latter as the album's second single on October 21, 2010. \\"Grenade\\" also reached number one on the US Hot 100, Canada, and the UK. It was also successful on other international charts. The album, released on October 5, 2010, in the United States, debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling 55,000 copies in its first week of release in the US. It charted at number one in Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other international album charts. Doo-Wops & Hooligans received generally positive reviews from music critics and has since sold 15,5 million copies worldwide. In February 2011, \\"The Lazy Song\\" was released as the third single from Doo-Wops & Hooligans and became the album's third consecutive top-five hit on the Hot 100, peaking at number four, while reaching the top spot in Denmark and the UK. \\"Talking to the Moon\\" became the fourth official single, only in Brazil, following its appearance on the soundtrack of the Brazilian telenovela Insensato Cora√ß√£o (Irrational Heart) from 2011. It reached the top position on Billboard Brasil's Hot Pop Songs and Hot 100 Airplay, spending several weeks on top of both charts. \\"Marry You\\" was first released as an international single on August 22, 2011. Although it was not released as a single in the US, it peaked at number 85 on the Hot 100 on January 15, 2011 due to strong digital sales (2.2 million sold ) and entered in several charts worldwide. In November 2011, \\"Count On Me\\" was released as the album's overall sixth single only in Australia, but charted in various regions. Additionally, Mars recorded and composed with The Smeezingtons a song titled \\"It Will Rain\\", the first single for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn ‚Äì Part 1 film soundtrack (2011). The song was released on iTunes on September 27, 2011. It peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number two in New Zealand. During this period, Mars appeared on a number of collaborative singles, including \\"Lighters\\", with American hip hop duo Bad Meets Evil, issued on July 5, 2011, \\"Mirror\\", with American rapper Lil Wayne, released on September 13, 2011, and \\"Young, Wild & Free\\" with American hip hop artists Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg, available for purchase on October 11, 2011. The songs peaked at number four, sixteen, and seven on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively, and reached the top twenty of various music charts worldwide. On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Hard Rock Casino for possession of cocaine. While talking to a police officer, Mars reportedly declared that what he did was \\"foolish\\" and that \\"he has never used drugs before.\\" Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year. He paid a $2,000 fine, did 200 hours of community service, and completed a drug counseling course. Nevertheless, in a cover story for GQ magazine in 2013, Mars said: \\"I was young, man! I was in f‚Äîing Vegas...I wasn't thinking\\". He added: \\"I was given a number one record and I'm out doing dumb sh--.\\" Mars confessed that he lied to the authorities about having done cocaine before, saying \\"I don't know where that came from\\", adding: \\"I was really intoxicated. I was really drunk. So a lot of that is a big blur, and I try every day to forget.\\" Mars started to promote his debut album as the opening act for American bands Maroon 5 and OneRepublic on the fall leg of the former act's Palm Trees & Power Lines Tour. Later, on October 18, 2010, the singer began a co-headlined European concert tour with Travis McCoy that lasted until early November. Doo-Wops & Hooligans received further promotion when the singer embarked on his first headlined concert tour, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, which ran from November 2010 to January 2012. Nevertheless, in February 2011, a joint co-headlining tour between Mars and Janelle Mon√°e was announced, dubbed Hooligans in Wondaland Tour (2011). The concert tour was performed in North America in May and June 2011. Most shows took place on smaller venues, such as theaters and ballrooms, which narrowed down Mars' income in the short term, since he rejected various offers to open for notable artists on arena tours, but led to create a substantial fan base. At the 2011 Grammy Awards, Mars won his first Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \\"Just the Way You Are\\" and received other six nominations for his work: Best Rap Song, Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Record of the Year for \\"Nothin' on You\\"; the latter category along with Song of the Year for \\"Fuck You\\" by CeeLo Green, and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical as part of The Smeezingtons. At the 2012 Grammy Awards, Mars lost all the six categories in which he was nominated to British singer Adele. This included Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Doo-Wops & Hooligans, Best Pop Solo Performance, Record and Song of the Year for \\"Grenade\\", while Producer of the Year, Non-Classical as The Smeezingtons was lost to Paul Epworth. During this time, Mars also won his first American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist, International Male Solo Artist at the Brit Awards and the Echo Award for Best International Male.See below on the Achievements section the links for these awards. 2012‚Äì2014: Unorthodox Jukebox and Super Bowl XLVIII Halftime Show On March 22, 2012, it was announced that Mars had signed a worldwide publishing deal with BMG Chrysalis US. In September 2012, when interviewed by Billboard magazine, Mars stated that his next album would be more musically varied and that he refused to \\"pick a lane\\", adding: \\"I want to have the freedom and luxury to walk into a studio and say, 'Today I want to do a hip-hop, R&B;, soul or rock record'\\". He announced the album title, Unorthodox Jukebox, along with the ten songs which would make the final cut, as well as the title of the first single, \\"Locked out of Heaven\\", which would be released on October 1, 2012. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canada and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. It also charted within the top ten in various countries. Unorthodox Jukebox, produced mainly by The Smeezingtons, was released on December 11, 2012, in the United States. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, and eventually peaked at number one on the chart. It also charted at number one in Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and in the United Kingdom, where it became the third fastest-selling album by a solo artist in 2012. The album has since sold six million copies worldwide. \\"When I Was Your Man\\" was released as the second single from Unorthodox Jukebox and also peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100; with the feat, aside from Elvis Presley, no other male artist had achieved five number-one singles on the Hot 100 more quickly than Mars. It reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and was top ten in several countries worldwide. The album's third single, \\"Treasure\\", peaked at number five in the United States, but had less commercial success worldwide than the previous two singles. On May 24, 2013, Major Lazer issued a remix of \\"Bubble Butt\\" as the fourth single from their album Free the Universe, featuring Tyga, 2 Chainz, Mystic, and Mars on vocals. In late 2013, \\"Gorilla\\" and \\"Young Girls\\" followed as the fourth and fifth singles from Unorthodox Jukebox, and reached the top 35 on the Hot 100. Mars ran his second headlining concert tour, the Moonshine Jungle Tour, from June 2013 to October 2014. He also announced a concert residency titled Bruno Mars at The Chelsea, Las Vegas, Paradise, Nevada. The tour grossed $156.4 million. On September 8, 2013, Mars was disclosed as the headline performer at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which took place on February 2, 2014, with American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers as special guests. It was the first Super Bowl halftime headlined by a performer under 30 in a decade. It was the most watched halftime show in the history of the Super Bowl at that time, drawing a rating of 115.3 million viewers. The viewership for the halftime show was higher than that for the game. At the 2014 Grammy Awards, Mars won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album for Unorthodox Jukebox. \\"Locked Out of Heaven\\" was nominated for Record and Song of the Year, while \\"When I Was Your Man\\" earned a nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance.

The song was a major commercial success, reaching number one in several countries worldwide, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. \\"Uptown Funk\\" spent a total of fourteen and seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, respectively. Its success led it to become a worldwide phenomenon with major impact on pop culture.

At that time, seven songs for the album had already been recorded. In May 2016, the singer split with his manager, Brandon Creed, as the latter sold half his management company. Mars took his business affairs under his own management company, Gorilla Management, operated by Aaron Elharar.

On February 2020, it was announced a partnership between Mars and Disney for a \\"music-themed theatrical narrative\\", in which the singer will both star in and produce the movie. On March 26, 2020, a representative of Mars stated the latter was \\"in the creative process of working on his next album.\\" Artistry=Influences As a child, Mars spent time impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact had a major impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: > I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people > because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing > for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to > see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I‚Äôm a > fan. He also impersonated Michael Jackson who is a major inspiration of his. Mars was raised on his father's doo-wop collection ‚Äì \\"simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point\\" and on Ventures, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Frankie Lymon, Little Anthony, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio, also influenced him. Mars' musical style gravitated initially towards R&B; since he was influenced by artists such as Keith Sweat, Jodeci, and R. Kelly. As a child he also took notice of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, New Edition, Bobby Brown, Boyz II Men, Teddy Riley and Babyface. At the same time, he also listened to 1950s rock 'n' roll, doo-wop music, and Motown. In high school, he listened to classic rock groups such as Led Zeppelin, and The Beatles, whose influences can be heard in Mars' work, as well as singers with high voices, like Stevie Wonder and Freddie Mercury. Bob Marley, and local bands in Hawaii, were a major influence and account for his reggae roots. Hip-hop acts like Jay-Z, The Roots, and Cody Chesnutt were among some of Mars' favourites, and have influenced his composition skills. Each of these musical genres has influenced Mars' musical style; he observed that: \\"It's not easy to [create] songs with that mixture of rock and soul and hip-hop, and there's only a handful of them.\\" Mars also admires classical music. Other artists Mars has said inspired his work include: Janet Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, Amy Winehouse, Sly Stone, Carlos Santana, George Clinton, and Usher. Mars has also stated that he is a fan of: Alicia Keys, Jessie J, Jack White, The Saturdays, and Kings of Leon. Musical style and themes Mars' music has been noted for displaying a wide variety of styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, R&B;, funk, soul, reggae, hip hop, and rock. His debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, is predominantly a pop and R&B; record, influence by most of the genres mentioned above. Many of his songs on the album, reflect \\"feel-good\\", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships, pain and loneliness. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different from the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song \\"Gorilla\\" caused a controversy in Australia. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, was significantly influenced by R&B;, soul, funk, pop and new jack swing. Lyrically, the album involves themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: \\"I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', since \\"You can‚Äôt force creativeness\\" as inspiration comes out of the blue in different places. Ideas occur suddenly to him; and occasionally, he is able to materialize them into lyrics. Mars claims that his work with other artists has influenced his musical style: \\"Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favourites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's Just the Way You Are. If you know my story, you know I love all different genres of music.\\" Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: \\"In Hawaii some of the biggest radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first.\\" Philip Lawrence, one of his music partners from The Smeezingtons, stated: \\"What people don't know is there's a darker underbelly to Bruno Mars.\\" Nevertheless, most of his music is romantic and Mars himself says: \\"I blame that on me singing to girls back in high school\\". Mars possesses a three octave tenor vocal range. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that he is one of the most \\"versatile and accessible singers in pop, with a light, soul- influenced voice that's an easy fit in a range of styles, a universal donor\\", while Tim Sendra from AllMusic described Mars' vocals on Doo-Wops & Hooligans as \\"the kind of smooth instrument that slips into your ear like honey.\\" Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone called Mars a \\"nimble, soulful vocalist\\" on Unorthodox Jukebox.

On 24K Magic, Consequence of Sounds Karen Gwen afirmed that Mars showed his \\"pips\\" and pushed his vocals to the limit. She described his voice as a \\"clear, unapologetic tenor\\" being a \\"blessing\\" nowadays.

Mars is also able to play drums, guitar, keyboard, bass, piano, and ukulele. Mars usually plays the instrumentation or part of it, on his albums and on the songs he composes for other artists.Instrumentation credits for Bruno Mars: * * * * * * * * * * Showmanship alt=Mars performing in a concert Mars is known for his retro showmanship which is widely acclaimed by tour critics and reviewers. Deanna Ramsay of The Jakarta Post described Mars as a \\"truly global star\\". Boston Heralds Jim Sullivan compared Mars' shownmaship to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley. Kevin Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called Mars a \\"consummate performer.\\" The Boston Globe Sarah Rodman said that Mars shows an \\"indefatigable ecstatic approach to performing\\" and \\"classic showmanship.\\" In the same vein, Jim Farber of the Daily News stated of the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVIII that Mars \\"brings old-school showmanship to dynamic performance.\\" The singer took its inspiration by playing videotapes of Elvis, James Brown and Michael Jackson when he was younger. Nowadays, before the shows, he watches Brown's T.A.M.I. Show, James Hendrix's Live at Woodstock or Prince performing \\"Purple Rain\\" (1984). During The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, Ara Jansan from The West Australian called the performance \\"one of the most creative and exciting displays of musical artistry\\" she had witnessed in a long time and noticed the concert attracted a wide-ranging audience of all age groups. The Oregonians Robert Ham noticed, on the Hooligans in Wondaland Tour, that the singer not only grabbed the spectators' attention throughout the entire concert, but he also sang every note by himself with noticeable guitar skills. During the Moonshine Jungle Tour, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described Mars' performance as \\"entertaining ... keeping smiles plastered on the faces of his onlookers, and he does a better job at it than almost anyone working in music right now\\". Rolling Stone magazine placed Mars at number 35 on its list of 50 Best Live Acts Right Now in 2013; \\"Anyone from the age of 5 to 95 can walk out of a Bruno Mars concert feeling like the show was designed just for them. Mars walks the old-school walk and talks the sexy talk, but he also nails the hits, leads a super-energetic nine-piece soul band, and rips a mean drum solo\\". NFL executives Sarah Moll and Tracy Perlman stated that: \\"If you go to his concerts, it's 11-year-old girls to 65-year-old women‚Äîit's everyone\\", after seeing The Moonshine Jungle tour several times during the summer of 2013. The 24K Magic World Tour, was praised by critics due to Mars' showmanship, guitar skills and stage production. The tour won two Pollstar awards, two Billboard Music Awards and one TEC Award. 24K Magic World Tour awards * * * * Mars' concerts feature The Hooligans, a band that includes: a guitarist, bassist, drummer, keyboardist, and a horn section. They also serve as dancers and background singers. Critics noted the difference the backup band and the arrangements made to the sound of the live versions of the songs compared to those on the album. Mars' shows feature all-band choreographed dancing arrangements, which include footwork that is inspired by James Brown and the splits. His shows are heavily influenced by the disco era with a soul revue- inspired set. In addition, long, mellow, and soft interludes that echo the smooth contemporary R&B; style which was popular during the 1990s are also part of the show. His set list blends several genres of music such as: pop, doo-wop, funk, R&B;, soul and reggae. His first two headlining concert tours included various covers.

On September 27, 2017, Mars expanded his camp scholarship in order to include applicants from all over the United States. The singer established the partnership in honor of his mother. A day before a concert in the Philippines Mars donated $100,000 (US) to the orphans of Bantay Bata, who were among the victims of Typhoon Haiyan, in order to raise the morale of those who lost their families and homes. Mars performed at the Make It Right gala, whose campaign goal is to \\"help build homes for people in need.\\" He also performed at the Robin Hood Foundation's 2014 annual benefit in New York, whose goal is to \\"fight poverty in New York City by supporting nonprofit organizations with financial and technical assistance.\\" In 2017, Mars donated 1 million dollars from the show at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Michigan to help the victims of the Flint water crisis. The singer participated in the \\"Somos Una Voz\\" relief initiative, created by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, in order to help survivors of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Mexico's 7.1 earthquake.

In 2019, Billboard placed him on number 41 of its list of Greatest of All Time Artists and was number 14 on the list of Top Touring Artists of the 2010s decade. In the same year, iHeartRadio Canada placed Mars on theirs \\"Icons of the Decade\\" of the 2010s, while Insider gave him an honorable mention as he didn't made the cut for the artists that defined the 2010s list. Mars' \\"When I Was Your Man\\" became the second number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 to feature exclusively piano and vocals. He is the first male artist to place two titles as a lead act in the Hot 100's top 10 simultaneously. In total, he has had seven number-one singles on the Hot 100 chart. In 2018, Mars matched Beyonce and Mariah Carey as the only artists with three Top Five singles on the Billboard Hot 100 from their first three studio albums. In the same year, he became the first solo male artist with nine number ones on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. Mars, Ed Sheeran and Jewel are the only artists with two songs to spend at least half a year on the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10. According to the International Federation of Phonographic Industry (IFPI), \\"Just the Way You Are\\" and \\"Grenade\\" are two of the most successful digital singles of all time, with sales of 12.5 million and 10.2 million, respectively. This contributed to Mars becoming the biggest selling artist of 2012. His songs \\"Just The Way You Are\\", \\"Grenade\\", \\"Locked Out Of Heaven\\", and \\"When I Was Your Man\\" have each sold over 4 million digital copies, making him the first male artist to do so as a lead singer. Six of his singles are counted among the best-selling singles of all time.International Federation of the Phonographic Industry Sales: * * * * Worldwide, Mars has sold 26 million albums as of 2016, and a total of 200 million singles as of 2020. Due to the ticket reselling which occurred during the week after Mars' performance at the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law. However, the bill died at the conference committee. Personal life=Family and relationships Mars's brother, Eric, has continuously served as the drummer for his backup band, The Hooligans. Their sisters, Tiara, Tahiti, and Presley, as well as their cousin Jaime, make up the all-girl music group The Lylas. When she was young, Jamie moved in with the siblings due to parental issues. Mars began dating model Jessica Caban in 2011. The two remain a couple , residing together in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills with a Rottweiler named \\"Geronimo\\". Mars returned from an overseas gig in May 2013 when he learned in the Los Angeles airport that his mother was gravely ill. He immediately got on a plane to Hawaii. His mother died the next day. On June 2, 2013, a publicist for Atlantic Records confirmed to the Associated Press that Mars' mother had suffered a brain aneurysm. She had died on Saturday, June 1, 2013, at age 55, at Queens Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. Later, on June 7, 2013, the singer wrote about the loss of his mother on Twitter: \\"So thankful for all the love during the most difficult time in my life. I'll be back on my feet again soon. That's what mom wants, she told me.\\" Race In 2013, Mars told Rolling Stone that record executives \\"had trouble categorizing him\\", as they were clueless which radio stations would play his songs, and which people (black or white) were going to buy his albums. In the same month, he confessed that \\"Nothin' on You\\" was rejected by a \\"music industry decision-maker\\" because of his race. That experience made him feel like a \\"mutant\\", and he says that was his lowest point. \\"Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room.\\" In 2018, Mars was accused during The Grapevine, a series that explores African-American issues, of cultural appropriation on social media for using his racial ambiguity to profit from black music, and was criticized for mimicking the sound of past artists. Various black celebrities, including Stevie Wonder, Charlie Wilson, 9th Wonder, Marjua Estevez, and Stereo Williams dismissed the accusations. Mars has spoken often about his influences and has given credit to several black artists, such as Babyface, Teddy Riley, and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Legal issues On January 28, 2014, Demetrius Orlandus Proctor filed a lawsuit, claiming he holds the copyright for the Travie McCoy and Mars' track \\"Billionaire\\". Proctor claimed he owned the copyright to the music and lyrics of the track since March 31, 2011, though the song was released a year before. As evidence, Proctor has submitted a United States Copyright Office registration certificate for \\"Frisky Vol. 1 to 30 (Tapes)\\", issued in 2000. Proctor accused McCoy and Mars of \\"willful and intentional\\" infringement of copyright, seeking the destruction of all copies of the recording. Proctor claims he has exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the song. Mark Ronson and Mars' \\"Uptown Funk\\" has received various accusations and lawsuits over copyright infringement. In 2015, similarities with \\"Oops Up Side Your Head\\" (1979) by The Gap Band led them, along with keyboardist Rudolph Taylor, and producer Lonnie Simmons to be added as co-writers of \\"Uptown Funk\\" and receive publishing royalties. In the same year, Serbian artist Viktorija argued that \\"Uptown Funk\\" infringed on one of her tracks. She decided not to sue Mars and Ronson. In 2016, electro-funk band Collage sued Ronson and Mars for copying their single, \\"Young Girls\\" (1983), while The Sequence, a rap group, claimed it infringed their single \\"Funk You Up\\" (1979) and sued a year later. In 2017, Lastrada Entertainment filed a lawsuit due to similarities with \\"More Bounce to the Ounce\\" (1980) by Zapp. The company seeks damage, a jury trial and prevent Ronson from profiting with \\"Uptown Funk\\". In 2018, the Collage and Zapp lawsuit were dropped, it was not revealed if there was any financial settlement. \\"Treasure\\" was re-registered with new writing credits, which included Thibaut Berland and Christopher Khan, due to the similarities with Breakbot's \\"Baby I'm Yours\\". Wealth Billboard estimated Mars' earnings around $18,839,681, making him the twelfth highest paid musician of 2013. Forbes magazine began reporting on Bruno Mars' earnings in 2014, calculating that the $60 million earned between June 2013 to June 2014, for his music and tour, which made him thirteenth on the list of the Celebrity 100 list. In June 2017, Mars ranked at sixth on the Forbes World's Highest Paid Celebrities, earning an estimated $39 million throughout June 2016 ‚Äì June 2017. In July 2018, Forbes announced that Mars was America's highest-paid musician of 2017, with an estimated total of $100 million. This, in turn, placed him at number 11 on the Celebrity 100 list as well as being his highest yearly earnings to date. In 2019, he was placed at number 54 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, with estimated earnings of $51.5 million throughout June 1, 2018, and June 1, 2019.

In mathematics, especially real analysis, a flat function is a smooth function ∆í : ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù all of whose derivatives vanish at a given point x0 ‚àà ‚Ñù. The flat functions are, in some sense, the antitheses of the analytic functions.

In the case of a flat function we see that all derivatives vanish at x0 ‚àà ‚Ñù, i.e. ∆í(k)(x0) = 0 for all k ‚àà ‚Ñï. This means that a meaningful Taylor series expansion in a neighbourhood of x0 is impossible.

It handled vegetables grown in the Bromham area, as well as milk. After the completion of the Devizes line in 1858, the junction at Holt allowed the fastest route from London to the West Country. However the Devizes line lost to competition and returned to a branch line in 1900.  Closure  Bromham and Rowde suffered from reduced traffic after the completion of the Patney and Chirton-Westbury line, that by-passed the Devizes Branch Line to shorten the London to Bristol journey by five miles. As a result, Bromham and Rowde later lost its stationmaster in 1952. The line and the halt were closed in 1966 under the Beeching cuts and the station was demolished in 1970.

The power plant uses the pumped-storage hydroelectric method to generate electricity during periods of high energy demand, making it a peaking power plant, intended to fulfill peak electricity demand in Tehran to the south. When complete it will have an installed generating capacity of and a pumping capacity of . Planning for the project began in the 1970s and construction began in 1985. It was delayed from 1992 until 2001 and the first generator went online in May 2013. The remaining generators were commissioned by 1 September 2015. The power plant is the first pumped-storage type in Iran and will also use the country's first concrete- face rock-fill dam ‚Äì two of them. Background A site was first identified for the power plant in the 1970s when a study was carried out on the water resources of the Albors Mountains by the Belgian firm Traksionel. Several sites for dams were identified including Siah Bisheh as a potential place for a pumped-storage power plant. In 1975, a feasibility report on the Siah Bisheh project was submitted to the Ministry of Energy. The Albors Mountains study concluded in 1977 and geologic studies began in 1978 but were halted in 1979 due to the Iranian Revolution. In 1983, Lahmeyer International was contracted to create designs for Phase II (underground excavation) which were completed in 1985, the same year construction on the dam's diversion tunnels began. Further designs for Phase I (superstructures) were developed and construction continued until 1992 when a lack of funding halted the project once again. Construction would not commence again until 2001. In 2002 and 2003, contracts for the dams and power plant were awarded and construction continued. The project was 90 percent complete as of April 2012. Both the upper and lower reservoir were complete and had finished impounding in January 2013. The first of four generators was commissioned in May 2013 and the remaining were operational by 1 September 2015. Design and operation The power plant operates using a lower and upper reservoir along with a power plant connected to both. Water is either pumped from the lower to the upper reservoir to serve as stored energy or released from the upper to the lower reservoir to generate electricity. Pumping occurs during low demand, cheap electricity, periods such as night and generating will occur during peak demand, expensive electricity, hours such as during the day. The pumping/generating process repeats as needed. Both the upper and lower reservoirs are created by concrete-face rock- fill dams on the Chalus River which has an average inflow of . The upper dam is tall and long. It contains of fill (structural volume) and is wide at its crest and wide at its base. Its reservoir has a storage capacity of (of which is active or usable) and a surface area of . The lower reservoir dam is the bigger of the two and is tall and long. It contains of fill and is wide at its crest and wide at its base. Its reservoir has a storage capacity of (of which is active or usable) and a surface area of . Each of the dams are equipped with a chute staircase spillway. The upper dam's has a maximum discharge capacity of and the lower: . The normal elevation for the upper reservoir is and the lower which affords a gross maximum hydraulic head of and normal of . Connecting the upper reservoir to the power station is an intake which feeds water into two diameter head-race tunnels. Their length from the intake to two surge tanks (used to prevent water hammer) is (left tunnel) and (right tunnel). From the surge tanks the tunnels each turn into a long penstocks which delivers water to the power station which is located underground near the lower reservoir. At the power station, each penstock bifurcates into two penstocks to supply the four Francis turbine pump-generators with water. The pump-generators have a generating capacity of 260 MW and pumping capacity of 235 MW. The generators can each discharge up to of water and the power is converted by transformers to 400 kV. After water is discharged by the generators, it proceeds down one of two tail-race tunnels ( and in length) before being discharged into the lower reservoir. When pumping is required, the pump-generators reverse into pumps and send water back to the upper reservoir through the same water conduits. Each generator can pump up to of water.

The battle would end with a Paraguayan victory; but it boosted confidence in the local population to declare themselves independent from both Buenos Aires patriots and royalists months later.  Background  At the outbreak of the May Revolution in Buenos Aires, capital of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, the government emerged from it, called (in Spanish) Junta Provisional Gubernativa de las Provincias del R√≠o de la Plata a nombre del se√±or don Fernando VII, invited other cities and provinces of the same to join the Revolution. The invitation, in fact, left no room for refusal, and every gesture in the sense of preserving the pre-revolutionary government was interpreted as hostile. The main threats came from Cordoba, Upper Peru, Montevideo and Asuncion. The first two were defeated with relative ease, but Montevideo would stand firm in their opposition for four years. Paraguayan governor, Bernardo de Velasco, refused to recognize the authority of the Board, as a result of an open cabildo in Asuncion that decided to keep the loyalty to the Regency Counsel of Spain. Unaware of this, and assuming that the Paraguayan patriots were stronger than they were, the Junta sent a small military expedition, commanded by one of its members, Manuel Belgrano, to unite the territory governed by Paraguay, through negotiations or through force. The issue was raised as it passed through Santa Fe, but the invitation to recognize the authority of the Junta was rejected. Belgrano entered into Paraguayan territory, overcoming slight resistance in the battle of Campichuelo. Belgrano crossed the Tebicuary River on 11 January, finding abandoned villages since Velasco evacuated them with his retreat.Instituto Nacional Belgraniano During the night of January 15, Belgrano sent a vanguard of 200 men and 2 guns to surprise the Paraguayans, but the attack never took place. The next morning, the Argentine general was positioned himself on a hill, from where he watched the Paraguayan camp. Although the enemy force at least exceeded theirs by a ratio of ten to one, decided to attack without exhausting the possibilities to negotiate. Although Belgrano had sent several proclamations to the Paraguayans, inviting them to act by the revolution, Velasco banned all such pamphlets. Belgrano considered if he succeeded, it would open the entrance to Asuncion. And if he was defeated, at least his army was far enough inside enemy territory to avoid being completely expelled. On the other hand, it is possible that he and his officers despised the combat capability of Paraguayans and overestimated the possibility of inspiring patriotic enthusiasm. The battle Belgrano organized his infantry into two rows of 220 and 240 men, and placed Machain's cavalry on the right and Perdriel's on the left (100 riders each). In reserve back at Cerro Mbae, were 70 riders and militia guarding the baggage train. Battle of Paraguar√≠. Red: Belgrano's forces. Azul: Velasco's forces After ordering that his troops mass out 3:00 in the morning on January 19, Belgrano ordered the advance. An hour later, the fighting was widespread. The attack came as a surprise to the Paraguayans, forcing them to abandon their positions. The governor Velasco fled towards Asuncion. But the cavalry, commanded by Manuel Caba√±as withdrew without fighting and deployed on the flanks of the attacking army. The patriots were distracted in looting the food stores of the Paraguayan army, so that only half of the force continued to fight, while the defenders were rearming themselves. To make matters worse, when Belgrano sent reinforcements of about 120 men, under the command of his aide Ramon Espindola, in support of Machain. Machain believing they were the enemy, ordereded a retreat. Amidst the confusion, the Paraguayan wings commanded by Gamarra and Cabanas, surrounded Espindola and Machain. Machain escaped but Espindola was killed. Considering that everything was lost, Belgrano ordered a withdrawal to the south. Consequences The Battle of Paraguari was not a final victory for the Paraguayan royalists. Belgrano still had his army. But the colonial government had been saved, and the province could not be compelled to submit to the government of Buenos Aires. Weeks later, Belgrano would definitely be defeated at the battle of Tacuar√≠ and expelled from Paraguay. When, months later, Paraguay declared its independence from Spain, would make clear that none were willing to go to Buenos Aires. And when the successive governments of Buenos Aires is clearly likely to show the other provinces to deny equal rights, Paraguay affirm this trend in a final independence.

It looks at Noah's previously unknown older brother, Yessah - nicknamed as such by his nephews after the response he gives to his brother's orders, his full name of Hazardikladoran being too much of a mouthful - and his role in the Ark's construction and journey. Yessah is essentially used as a servant by his family, as he is assigned the tasks of cutting down the trees to make the ark, painting the ark with pitch, collecting the animals, and mucking them out during the voyage. During the novel, Yessah befriends two white doves, 'Peace' and 'Goodwill', who become his friends and helped him gather the animals before the Ark's voyage. He also saves the Ark from sinking at one point when the lower decks become too waterlogged, resulting in the portholes starting to sink under the water; by having the large animals plug the portholes with their bottoms, he is able to buy time to pump the water out. After Peace is sent away to find land, the Ark eventually stops, with the rest of the family leaving the Ark while Yessah is out searching the mountain of Ararat to avoid having to deal with his 'inconvenience'. Despite his solitude, Yessah concludes that he has a good life, appreciating that he has survived the flood and made friends with the animals, living for the rest of his life with Peace and Goodwill.

Gorman and his father were the proprietors of several quarries in the Laurel area and Prince George's County that supplied granite and stone for the U.S. Treasury building and the United States Capitol, in Washington, along with material for bridge construction on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, first passenger railway in the country, begun 1827. William Gorman died July 7, 1915, from a stroke paralysis at Ford Springs, Pennsylvania.

The novel is about John, a young orphan in the Middle Ages who is adopted by dragons. Dragon Boy appears on numerous school reading lists and is taught in schools. It has been used as one of the practice texts for the English Common Entrance Examination for year 6 students to move to senior school. Plot summary Montague Bunsen-Burner is a dragon who is put on a 'no-humans' diet by his wife Albertina. Out on a flight later that day, Montague discovers a young boy, John, who was recently orphaned. Montague decides to take the boy home with him. John proves his worth as a member of the family with his knowledge of various forest herbs that enhance the flavour of several foods. John proves his value to the family further when Albertina lays her latest clutch of eggs. Deducing that Montague and Albertina are ignorant of the need to incubate eggs, John manages to smuggle an egg away from Albertina's latest clutch and place it in a 'nest' made of reeds, inspired by a lizard nest he saw when he was younger, that will keep it warm until it hatches (taking only one egg in secret in case he is wrong about how dragon eggs develop). While returning from hiding the egg, John is nearly attacked by a wolf, and later a bear, but Montague manages to save him and kill both animals, the bearskin being kept for John to sleep under in winter. Noting that the wolf is milky, John deduces that she has cubs, setting out to find her family. Although three of the cubs are dead when he finds her den, John takes in the fourth cub (a coal-black male), naming him 'Bart' (after Montague's father) and training him as a pet. After John and Bart have kept an eye on the egg in its makeshift 'nest' for the next six weeks, it finally hatches, revealing a young female dragon who names herself 'Lucky', much to the joy of her parents. From this point onwards, John is regularly described as the Bunsen-Burner's adopted son and Lucky's 'little brother'. Although John attracts some quizzical gazes when an elderly dragon Examiner comes to test Lucky's flying abilities, no definite questions are asked, and Lucky herself passes her test with flying colours. While the dragons take a holiday at the beach where Montague and Albertina stayed after their wedding, shortly after Lucky's first birthday, John and Bart are confronted by wolves, being cornered in the cave before they are forced to attack. However, Lucky senses that her brother is in danger and returns to save him, although the subsequent damage to John's clothes forces them to travel to a nearby village to steal replacement clothes for him. During their time away, the Bunsen-Burners are briefly attacked by a group of ambitious knights, but the dragons easily drive them away without any casualties (Albertina resolutely informing Montague that their relationship with John means that they must never eat human flesh again after everything he has come to mean to them). As Lucky grows older, the comparative rarity of dragons in the present compared to their old courting days prompt Montague and Albertina to try to search for a potential husband for her in an arranged marriage, but their search fails; Albertina is harshly turned away by the head of a family of Welsh dragons, and while Montague discovers a pleasant family- the Charmouths-, they have nothing but daughters. Fortunately, while visiting the holiday beach in a bad mood about her parents' attempt to plan her life for her, Lucky discovers a boy dragon called Gerald Fire-Drake, who left his home in Scotland after an argument with his father, the two forming a deep attachment that blossoms into romance. During this time, John has a brief encounter with an outlaw who threatens to kill him, but Bart senses his master's peril and hurries to save him, Bart's attack- followed closely by the arrival of Albertina- prompting the outlaw to flee while leaving John his weapons. After an engagement of a couple of years due to Gerald and Lucky's youth, their wedding takes place near the lake where Lucky hatched, attended by the Fire-Drakes, Albertina's cousins, Montague's brother and his wife, the Examiner who gave Lucky her test, and the Charmouths (Montague reasoning that they are a pleasant family and Gerald's brothers might be interested). The ceremony completed after John gives a speech in his role as best man, Gerald and Lucky fly off for their honeymoon, leaving John to reflect on the joys of his life as a dragon boy. Allusion to legend In the latter chapters of the novel, John reveals that his surname is Little, Lucky reflecting that she always thought of him as 'Little John'. The novel notes that 'Little John' will grow into a giant of a man and the strongest man in England, hinting that he is the 'Little John' from the myth of Robin Hood. Reception Critical reception for the book was positive. An unknown reviewer from Quill & Quire stated the author \\"fills the book with adventure and humour, keeps his touch light and his nonsense uncomplicated, and creates a world of human - dragon relationships that will resemble some young readers' own favourite fantasies: easy to accept and thoroughly entertaining.\\" Shirley Lewis, writing for Emergency Librarian, felt the book was \\"[f]ull of excitement and danger.\\" Moira Robinson, in Magpies, compared King-Smith's writing to Quentin Blake's illustrations. She stated the adventures in the story were \\"all good rollicking fun with terrible jokes about knights in armour\\" or \\"appalling parodies\\". The Junior Bookshelf's D. A. Young stated \\"Dick King-Smith makes the most of the satirical possibilities offered by attributing the foibles of the class system to the world of dragons.\\" A. Fisher from Books for Your Children likened Dragon Boy to other stories by the author, adding that it is well written.

He defended the thesis of the Nancy School in the field of hypnosis. He is known for his works on anatomy, physiology, psychology and hypnosis. Childhood Henri-√âtienne Beaunis was born in Amboise in 1830. The name on his birth certificate is Henry-√âtienne Beaunis, but most of his publications were made under the name of Henri- √âtienne Beaunis.Nicolas, Serge (1995) Henri Beaunis (1830‚Äì1921) Directeur- fondateur du laboratoire de psychologie physiologique de la sorbonne. L'ann√©e Psychologique 95:267-291 His mother, who was married to a government employee, had to leave Rouen when the city became threatened by the July revolution. When his mother returned to his father, she left Beaunis in Touraine under the care of his grandmother. When he was very young, he started to be interested to reading and arts. He had great successes at school and obtained successively the Baccalaur√©at √®s lettres (1848) and the Baccalaur√©at √®s sciences physiques (1849). Studies He studied in Rouen until he began his medical specialisation in Paris. He obtained his medical doctoral degree in Montpellier in 1856. His thesis was focused on habits and was published under the name of De l'habitude en g√©n√©ral. He presented his vision of habits and pleaded for people to see habits as ways of improving ourselves, and not as repetitive acts that allows us to please ourselves in rest and happiness.Bergson Henri, Ragghianti Renzo (2006) Le√ßons clermontoises, Volume 2. Editions L'Harmattan. His father was not an enthusiast for the arts and encouraged him to pursue the path of medicine. Henri-√âtienne Beaunis chose medicine and enlisted himself in the French army. He served in Algeria many times and came back to France with the title of m√©decin-major de deuxi√®me classe in 1860. His work Anatomie g√©n√©rale et physiologie du syst√®me lymphatique was presented as a thesis for his aggr√©gation de m√©decine in anatomical and physiological sciences. This was an obligatory step in France to become a professor. He then became professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Strasbourg. Early career Five years after he became professor at Strasbourg, he published a book called Nouveaux √©l√©ments d'anatomie descriptive et d'embryologie with his colleague Abel Bouchard, who was also a medic in the army.Beaunis, H.E., Bouchard A. (1868) Nouveaux √©l√©ments d'anatomie descriptive et d'embryologie. J.B. Bailli√®re et fils, eds. The book was a synthesis of the anatomical and embryological knowledge for students of science and medicine. The authors used their knowledge of German to stay in touch with the latest discoveries, which were often published in German during this period. Beaunis wrote the sections on osteology, articulations, myology, viscera, senses, the human body in general, and embryology. Bouchard wrote the sections on angiology and neurology. In 1870 and 1871, Beaunis underwent the Franco-Prussian War which led to the French side losing a part of Alsace-Lorraine. In 1871, he published in the Gazette m√©dicale de Paris extracts of his diary describing his life during this period and more specifically during the Siege of Strasbourg.Beaunis, H.E. (1887) Impressions de campagne (1870-1871). F√©lix Alcan, Berger-Levrault et Cie, eds. He described the intellectual climate that was developing before the war and the progressive opening to scientific dialogs both in Germany and France, especially in the fields of physiology and medicine. After his involvement as a medic, the Faculty of Medicine of Strasbourg was transferred to Nancy, where he obtained the chair of Physiology, following the disappearance of E. K√ºss, who was the previous holder. Works in physiology and anatomy In 1874, he published his observations on a case of Situs inversus, a particular condition in which internal organs are misplaced in the body.Ministre de la guerre (1880) Recueil de m√©moires de m√©decine, de chirurgie et de pharmacie militaires, Victor Rozier, ed. His most massive work of this period was Nouveaux √âlements de physiologie humaine comprenant les principes de la physiologie compar√©e et de la physiologie g√©n√©rale, a book that synthesises the knowledge in physiology at that time, including knowledge in physiological psychology, which was usually left to philosophers. Supplementary editions were published in 1881 and 1888.Beaunis, H. (1881) Nouveaux √âlements de physiologie humaine comprenant les principes de la physiologie compar√©e et de la physiologie g√©n√©raleBeaunis, H. (1888) Nouveaux √âlements de physiologie humaine comprenant les principes de la physiologie compar√©e et de la physiologie g√©n√©rale. J.B. Bailli√®re et fils, eds. In Nancy, he published with Abel Bouchard Pr√©cis d'anatomie et de dissection in 1877. He considers this book as a sequel to Nouveaux √©l√©ments d'anatomie descriptive et d'embryologie.Beaunis, H.E., Bouchard, A. (1877) Pr√©cis d'anatomie et de dissection, J.B. Bailli√®re et fils, eds. Since the publication of Nouveaux √âlements de physiologie humaine, Beaunis had demonstrated his interest in including psychological processes in the general field of physiology. In 1884, he started publishing texts that explored this question specifically. He published De la justesse et de la fausset√© de la voix, a treatise that exposes amongst other ideas the idea that speech in man is the very complex expression of communicative capacities that are present in other animals and that speech is generated through mechanical processes involving mouth and throat muscles.Anger et al. (1886) Nouveau dictionnaire de m√©decine et de chirurgie pratiques, Volume 39. J.B. Bailli√®re et fils, eds. His laboratory started being well equipped in 1876, after which he started publishing scientific results that were collectively published in 1884.Beaunis H.

This collective work is called Recherches exp√©rimentales sur les conditions de l'activit√© c√©r√©brale et sur la physiologie des nerfs and describes some of the works of Albert K√ºss, Albert Ren√©, Maxime Drouot, Charles Mayard and Eug√®ne Gley. The majority of these works had been published in the Revue m√©dicale de l'Est or the Gazette des h√¥pitaux. The experiments described were performed in the laboratory of Beaunis. They consist in studying cerebral physiology, which would today be called neurophysiology. The research performed during this period in the laboratory include works on pneumotherapy, the physiological effects of nicotine, diuretic agents, the effects of cognitive processes on pulse, aneurysms, respiration, muscle contractions and reaction time to sensorial stimuli. His works in physiology led him to gain interest in hypnosis. He joined Ambroise-Auguste Li√©beault, Hippolyte Bernheim and Jules Li√©geois to defend the theses of the Nancy School against those of the Salp√™tri√®re School of Jean Martin Charcot. The Nancy School thought that hypnosis was a state similar to sleep produced by suggestion, while the Salp√™tri√®re School thought that it was a pathological state similar to hysteria. In 1887, he published Le somnambulisme provoqu√©: √©tudes physiologiques et psychologiques that he originally wanted to include in Recherches exp√©rimentales sur les conditions de l'activit√© c√©r√©brale et sur la physiologie des nerfs. The pressure of his editors encouraged him to create a separate work.Beaunis H. (1887) Le somnambulisme provoqu√©: √©tudes physiologiques et psychologiques. J.-B. Bailli√®re et Fils, eds. After this publication on hypnosis, he continued to publish general works in physiology and psychophysiology. In 1889, he published Les sensations internes, a synthesis of internal senses other than the five classically studied senses which underlie physiological mechanisms.Beaunis H. (1889) Les sensations internes. F√©lix Alcan, ed. In 1890, he published L'√©volution du syst√®me nerveux. In 1889, he founded at the Sorbonne the first French psychology laboratory. In 1894, he founded with Alfred Binet the scientific journal L'Ann√©e psychologique. In 1893, he published in his Travaux du Laboratoire de Psychologie Physiologique, a description of two cases of synesthesia. Works on art Henri-√âtienne Beaunis maintained throughout from his college years to his death a passion for arts. In 1917, he completed a work started at least in 1891 that consisted in traducing the theatre of Eschyle.Beaunis H. (1891) Les Suppliantes, d'Eschyle: drame lyrique en deux tableaux et en vers. Marpon et Flammarion, eds.Beaunis H. (1917) Trag√©dies He also published some novels under the pseudonym of Paul Abaur. He died at Le Cannet. Memoir Serge Nicolas, who wrote the most complete biography of Henri-√âtienne Beaunis, had access to a small part of the memoir written by Henri-√âtienne Beaunis. The complete memoir has not been recovered yet. In the biography he wrote, Serge Nicolas formulates the wish that his writing be recovered and made public.

') or Adhik Maas (translit. ' = 'extra', ' = 'month') is an extra month in the Hindu calendar that is inserted to keep the lunar and solar calendars aligned. Purushottam is an epithet of Vishnu or Rama to whom the month is dedicated. As Purushottam is the name of Lord Rama. The position of Adhik Maas amongst the other months is variable, re-occurring about every 32.5 months. This is in contrast to some other common lunisolar calendars that insert an intercalary lunar month at a fixed point of the year. For example, in the Jewish calendar, the extra month is added before Adar; in the Buddhist calendar, it is added after Ashadha / Waso. During 2018, Adhik Jyestha (extra month after Jyestha) was observed from 16 May to 13 June.http://www.hinduism.co.za/moon7.htm#2018%20April In 2020, Adhik Ashwin (extra month after Ashwin) will be from 18 September to 16 October 2020, leading to an unusual month long break between Pitri Paksha and DurgƒÅ PujƒÅ / NavarƒÅtri. The other names for Purushottam Maas are Adhik Maas and Mal Maas. Spellings in the Latin alphabet vary, including purshottam, purushottam, purushottama; adhik, adhika; mal, mala; maas, maasa, mƒÅs, mƒÅsa, mas,Shree Ram Maas. This is the thirteenth month of the lunar calendar.Adhik mass Adhik Maas adopts the name of the month that follows. It is a time for prayer, fasting, charity, and self-improvement. Overview According to Vasishtha Siddhantha (the treatise of Vasishtha), Purushottam Maas or the extra lunar month occurs after every 32 months, 16 days and 8 ghati. (A ghati is th of a sidereal day, approximately 24 minutes, so 8 ghati is about 3 hours.) In this reference the concept of Adhik Maas is unique to the traditional Hindu lunar calendars.12 important facts about Adhik Mass you must know! It is one of the most accurate methods to adjust the gap between Solar and Lunar Year. When the Sun does not at all transit into a new rƒÅshi (30¬∞ sidereal zodiac) but simply keeps moving within a rƒÅshi in a lunar month (i.e. before a new moon), then that lunar month will be named according to the first upcoming transit. It will also take the epithet adhik or \\"extra\\". The transition of the sun from one rƒÅ≈õi to the next is called sankranti. For example, if a lunar month elapsed without a sankranti and the next transit is into Mesha (Aries), then this month without transit is labelled Adhik Chaitra. The next month will be labeled according to its transit as usual and will get the epithet nija (\\"original\\") or shuddha (\\"clean\\"), in this case Nija Chaitra. The terms Pratham (first) Chaitra and Dwitiya (second) Chaitra may also be used.See for example first (adik) Asada and second Asada at June Adhika mƒÅsa (month) is the first of two whereas an adhika tithi is the second of two. Extra Month, or Adhika MƒÅsa falls every 32.5 months on an average. It is also known as Puru≈õottama MƒÅsa, it is said that the name was given by Lord Vishnu as his name to this month. The solar year is made up of 365 days and about 6 hours, and the lunar year is made up of 354 days. Thus there is a gap of 11 days, 1 hour, 31 minutes and 12 seconds between the lunar and the solar years. As this gap accumulates each year, it approximates in 2.7 years to one month. No adhik mas falls during Margsheersh to Magh. A case of Adhik Karttik is extremely rare, but in the 250-year span (1901-2150 AD) it would occur once, in 1963 AD.  Scientific calculation  The Moon takes about 27.3 days to make one complete orbit around the earth. The earth orbits around the sun once every 365.2422 days (= earth's orbital speed of 29.79 km per second). The earth and the moon in 27.3 days have moved as a system about 1/12 of the way around the sun. This means that from one full moon to the next full moon, the moon must travel 2.2 extra days before it appears again as a full moon, due to the curve of the earth's orbit around the sun. Ultimately this creates a variance of 10.87 days a year between a lunar year and a solar year. To compensate for this difference, the additional month is added after every 32.5 months on average. Just as there are lunar years with the extra month making 13 total months, there are lunar years with a reduced number of months, with only eleven months in the particular lunar year. The lunar year with eleven months is very rare. It occurs once in 140 years or once in 190 years. Religious significance of Adhik Maas A month-long mela (fair) is celebrated in Machhegaun village in Nepal during Adhika MƒÅsa. It is general belief that one can wash away all his sins by taking a bath in the pond at Machhenarayan temple. Since this is a special month which does not come every year, there are no specific festivals like Dussehra or Diwali in this month. Rather this month is treated as special and holy month and many people perform the adhik maas vrata. People perform extra mala japas, pradakshinas, pilgrimages, scriptural reading and parayanas. During Purushottam Maas, people perform various types of religious rituals such as keeping fast, recitation of religious scriptures, mantras, prayers, performing various types of puja and havan. Vratas (fasts) of various durations (full day, half day, weekly, fortnight, full month) are often undertaken. The vratas may be of complete fasting with liquids only or without liquids, fasting with fruits only or keeping fast with vegetarian food, as the individual can tolerate. It is said that the persons performing good deeds (satkarma) in this month conquer their senses (indriyas) and they totally come out of punar janam (the cycle of rebirth). In Beed district of Maharashtra there is a village called Purushottampuri where there is Temple of God Purushottam and which is unique temple, built with bricks which floats on water, which is a wonder. Every Adhik Mass there is big fair and thousands of people come from various places to take the blessings of God Purushottam.

Scott Fitzgerald that he developed into a play.F. S. Fitzgerald (1976). The Vegetable: or, From President to Postman. Scribner's. Background In the original publication of The Vegetable, or From President to Postman (1923), F. Scott Fitzgerald included the following quotation on the title page: ‚ÄúAny man who doesn‚Äôt want to get on in the world, to make a million dollars, and maybe even park his toothbrush in the White House, hasn‚Äôt got as much to him as a good dog has--he‚Äôs nothing more or less than a vegetable.‚Äù Fitzgerald used this quotation, which he claimed came ‚Äúfrom a current magazine,‚Äù as a springboard for his only published play. This comic romp satirizes the ambitions of an ordinary man who wants to be President of the United States--that is, if he cannot make it as a postman.Beilke, Debra, \\"Satirizing the American Nightmare: F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Vegetable\\". www.lexhamarts.org (retrieved 8/24/2016). Plot The play concerns the misadventures of the middle-class striver Jerry Frost. He is a 35-year-old \\"clerk for the railroad at $35,000 a year. He possesses no eyebrows, but nevertheless he constantly tries to knit them.\\"Fitzgerald, F. Scott, The Vegetable: Or, from President to Postman. Clifton, N.J.: A.M. Kelley, 1972. p. 6. His marriage to Charlotte (30) is dull, and he is stereotypically hen- pecked by her (cf. Ralph Cramden, Fred Flintstone, Homer Simpson, et al.). We learn in the first act that Jerry wanted to be a postman, but that he somehow blames his wife for missing out on this ambition... History Following The Beautiful and Damned, Fitzgerald hoped to secure financial wealth for him and his wife. The play's text was published in book form by Scribners on April 27, 1923, in a print run of 7,650 copies, each sold for $1.50.Bruccoli, Matthew J, and Jackson R. Bryer (1971). F. Scott Fitzgerald in His Own Time: A Miscellany. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, p. 209. In his youth, Fitzgerald had written and acted in plays (cf. The Captured Shadow F. Scott Fitzgerald (1928). The Captured Shadow. www.gutenberg.net.au.), and his work was generally recognized for qualities that should have translated to the stage: \\"he wrote commercially successful stories; he knew how to frame a scene; and his dialogue, at least in his best fiction, was smart, sophisticated, evocative.\\"Krystal, Arthur (Nov. 16, 2009). \\"Slow Fade: F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood.\\" The New Yorker (New York, N.Y.) 85.37. However, according to some critics, the play lacked focus.Bruccoli, Matthew J, and Jackson R. Bryer (1971). F. Scott Fitzgerald in His Own Time: A Miscellany. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press.

New York: Carroll & Graf, pp. 209 was widely regarded as a disaster. Zelda Fitzgerald later wrote in a letter that the audience were ‚Äúso obviously bored‚Äù and some walked out during the second act. Fitzgerald himself wrote that \\"I wanted to stop the show and say it was all a mistake but the actors struggled heroically on.\\" During the second intermission, Fitzgerald and Ring Lardner asked the lead actor, Ernest Truex, \\"Are you going to stay and do the last act?\\" The actor replied that he was, at which the pair of writers retorted that they were heading to a bar down the street.Turnbull, Andrew (1962). Scott Fitzgerald. New York: Scribner, p. 140 While Fitzgerald claimed to be proud of the work, and had hoped it would succeed, the critical and public reaction to the first and only performance left the author in a deep depression, followed by a drinking binge.Bryer, Jackson R (1967).

Characterized by the Washington Post as ‚Äúthe source of an epochal revolution in the scope and purposes of dance art,‚Äù she and her dancers have collaborated with shipbuilders, physicists, construction workers, and cancer researchers. In 2002 she won the MacArthur Genius Grant; in 2009, the Jack P. Blaney Award in Dialogue acknowledged her outstanding leadership, creativity, and dedication to melding dialogue with dance; and the 2017 Jacob‚Äôs Pillow Dance Award.  Early life  Liz Lerman was born in Los Angeles, California on Christmas Day, 1947. Her father Philip was an organizer and activist, and her mother was an artist. Though her family moved several times when she was growing up, much of her early education was spent in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When she was 14 years old, she danced in Washington, DC, for President Kennedy as part of a group from the National Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan. She attended Bennington College, where she studied under Martha Wittman, who would later become a company member of Dance Exchange. She graduated received her B.A. in dance from the University of Maryland and an M.A. in dance from George Washington University. Career She founded the Liz Lerman Dance Exchange in 1976 and led the company's multi-generational ensemble until July 2011, when Lerman passed the leadership of her company to Cassie Meador,; the company is now called simply Dance Exchange. . Under Liz's leadership Dance Exchange appeared across the U.S. in locations as various as the National Cathedral,http://www.nationalcathedral.org/staff/PE-49EKF-58001D.shtml Kennedy Center Opera House, and Millennium Stage,http://www.kennedy- center.org/programs/millennium/artist_detail.cfm?artist_id=lizlerdanc Lansburgh Theatre,http://www.jewish- theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2098 Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, Harvard University,http://www.jewish- theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=1639 and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.http://mcachicago.org/performances/now/all/2011/741 Lerman's early work was strongly associated with the inclusion of older people alongside more traditional young performers,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/11/arts/dance-690309.html and with the use of personal narrative. Her later-career work has focused on questions of science from genomicshttps://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/arts/dance/03lerm.html?_r=0 to high-energy physicshttp://www.nj.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2011/03/the_matter_of_origins_preview.html to the physical and psychic wounds of war.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-06-23/entertainment/bal-liz-lermans- healing-wars-provides-unique-theatrical-experience-20140623_1_liz-lerman- national-civil-war-project-arena-stage In January 2016 Liz Lerman joined the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona as Institute Professor to lead programs and courses that span disciplines across ASU.  Liz-as-Toolmaker  Lerman has a strong interest in generating, defining, iterating, and sharing the \\"tools\\" that result from her artistic processes. A ‚Äútool‚Äù, she describes could be a piece of information that is detached from other concepts and can be applied to many situations. These ideas also that the form of challenges or reminders to her artists, including ‚ÄúRattle around in someone else‚Äôs universe‚Äù; ‚ÄúTurn discomfort into inquiry‚Äù; ‚ÄúNothing is too small to notice‚Äù. At Liz Lerman Dance Exchange, her tool sharing took the form of an online \\"Toolbox,\\" with a later iteration called \\"D-Lab\\" that aimed to make certain tools widely accessible. Currently, Lerman is developing a new online platform, called The Atlas of Creative Tools, as the home for her existing and future tools.  Critical Response Process  Lerman created the Critical Response Process, a method for giving and receiving feedback. Lerman developed the Process (known as CRP) in 1990 after realizing artists tended to apologize, rather than ask questions, when presenting unfinished work. The Process was formalized through the publication of the book \\"Critical Response Process: getting useful feedback on anything you make, from dance to dessert\\" in 2003 which Lerman wrote with co-author John Borstel. Critical Response Process has a significant international presence, with institutional hosts including the Innovative Conservatoire,http://www.innovativeconservatoire.com/events/icon- seminar-13-kallio-kuninkala-helsinki-2/ the Federation of Scottish Theatres,http://www.scottishtheatre.org/projects-services/critical-response- process the London Sinfonietta,http://www.londonsinfonietta.org.uk/event/making-connections- collaborating-across-artforms-conference the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and Yorkshire Dancehttp://www.yorkshiredance.com/news/critical- response-process-workshop-with-liz-lerman in addition to US hosts such as the Yale School of Dramahttp://drama.yale.edu/facstaff/liz-lerman and the Tisch School for the Arts.http://tisch.nyu.edu/tisch-research-news-events/research- at-tisch/strategies/events-and-publications/liz-lerman-guest-visit CRP facilitator-cohorts are in development in Scotland http://www.puppetanimation.org/content/page.php?page_id=18‚äÇ_id=29 and in Baltimore, Maryland.http://www.baltimoreculture.org/programs/professional- development-training/critical-response-process-crp#.Vze7Itc7E7A In 2014 Yorkshire Dance developed a beta-version of an online-adaptation of CRP, called \\"respond.\\"http://www.respondto.org/#home Lerman conducts residencies on the Critical Response Process, creative research, the intersection of art and science, and the building of narrative within dance performance at such institutions as Harvard University, Yale School of Drama, Wesleyan University, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and the National Theatre Studio among many others. In 2020, Wesleyan University Press will publish Lerman‚Äôs second book on CRP, called ‚ÄúCritique is Creative,‚Äù written with John Borstel and including essays by CRP practitioners from around the world.

It is Number 35 in the composer's catalog of works. Trans is as much a work of theatre as it is a musical composition. It has a somnolent, irrational look and feel, for the simple reason that it is the representation of a dream. Stockhausen regarded it as an important work for himself, a key work and a whole new beginning‚Äîa \\"transcendental piece\\" . Origin Loom shuttles, source of the form-marking sounds in Trans The overall course of the entire piece came to Stockhausen in a dream during the night of 9‚Äì10 December 1970. In the morning, he had an early appointment, but took the time to jot down briefly in words what he had heard and seen: \\"Dreamt orchestral work ‚Ä¶ orchestra sits in series ‚Ä¶ sound wall opens with different intervals at periods of about twenty seconds, allowing music behind this wall to come through‚Äîbrass and woodwinds mixed‚Äîand I hear low instruments that are the fundamentals; in timbres they're colored like organ mixtures. With each low melodic line of one of the lower instruments there are several instruments in parallel, playing softer and coloring this low sound ‚Ä¶ at the same time I hear the sound of a weaving chair\\" . When he was asked by Otto Tomek to compose a piece for the Donaueschingen Festival the next October, Stockhausen first arranged to make some experiments for staging, lighting, and performing action in the hall there. Only after these were carried out in May and June 1971 did he begin composing the score (on 17 July). It was completed on 4 September, and the premiere took place in the Donaueschingen Stadthalle on 16 October 1971 (; ). Stockhausen considered titling the work Jenseits (The Other Side) or Musik f√ºr die n√§chsten Toten (Music for the Next to Die), with the subtitle \\"Requiem for the Orchestra\\" , before finally deciding on Trans, which means \\"across\\", but also suggests \\"trance\\" as well as words like \\"transition\\" and \\"transcendental\\" . On the day following the world premiere of Trans, a panel discussion was presented at Donaueschingen on the \\"Symphony Orchestra in a Changed World\\". Stockhausen participated in this discussion, contributing some characteristically provocative remarks. He held that that mentality of orchestral musicians has been reduced to that of the factory worker \\"who works only by the clock\\". They are no longer psychically prepared for their tasks and are frustrated as artists, having become just small cogs in a massive and confusing apparatus, completely deprived of their individuality. He blamed this condition not least on the protected, tenured status brought about by the collective bargaining politics of the unions, and proposed for the top musicians in each orchestra a two-month annual training course to update their skills. Needless to say, the response from orchestra managers was not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, but it did seem that Stockhausen was representing the struggle against this alleged \\"squad mentality\\" in his composition . Stage action Trans deliberately confounds the expectations of the conventional audience-orchestra dynamic by introducing ambiguities such as the suppression of normal visual cues, an invisible conductor, and‚Äîwith the exception of the interpolated cadenzas‚Äîno visible performer movements . When the curtain rises, the audience sees only the string section, in conventional concert attire, seated in two long rows (the second raised on a riser) behind a scrim lit with red-violet light . Stockhausen was very particular about the colour of this light: a violet hue interwoven with a red-to-yellowish hue that he had only ever seen in nature during a night-time flight from Copenhagen to Tokyo over the North Pole . The rest of the orchestra is concealed backstage, behind a half-wall. The music played by this visible instrumental group forms the slow, chordal \\"screen\\" over the invisible, more active layer played by the winds and percussion, who are concealed in the back half of the stage . The strings play impassively and rigidly, like puppets or automatons, with totally synchronised bow-movements . As in the composer's dream, every twenty seconds or so the sound of an old-fashioned loom shuttle shoots invisibly through the air in the hall from left to right. With each stroke of the shuttle, the strings begin a new note. Stockhausen had seen such looms used in Bali in 1970, and the sound also evoked childhood memories of the railroad switches his uncle had operated . These shuttle sounds were recorded for the piece by Stockhausen's assistant, in a small village in southern Germany . Toward the end, a startling moment occurs, when the hitherto rigid players suddenly start to sway around, in imitation of conventionally \\"expressive\\" string playing, only as mechanically synchronised as ever . Basel Fasnacht drums This visual rigidity is interrupted from time to time (in fact at the joins between the six main structural sections) by theatrical cadenzas, seemingly in reaction to the tension of the string players having to sit and play like zombies. First, a percussionist marches slowly onstage with a \\"Basel drum\\", like the ones still played in the Basel Fasnacht, and with a single loud stroke on the drum prompts the first violist to break into a berserk cadenza, quelled by the next shuttle-loom stroke. Then a stagehand brings out a music stand for the first cello, who plays an impassioned romantic solo, switched on and off by the light on the music stand. A little later, the concertmaster abruptly stands up and, as if in response to cramp, begins a nervous twitching on a single high note, bringing the entire orchestra to a stop. The string players all lean toward him and glare with reproach, and the rogue violinist, averting his gaze, meekly returns to his routine task . At the beginning of Part V, a solo trumpet appears in midair (actually by climbing a ladder behind the concealing wall) and plays a joyful reveille call, ending with a flatulent fluttertongued note, in the spirit of Richard Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel. The final interpolation, however, is an abrupt cessation of all sound for the better part of a minute, an intimidating \\"silent cadenza\\", marked at the centre by a triple shuttle stroke in a dotted-rhythm figure. The music then resumes to conclude the work with a dignified chorale-like coda, reminiscent of the ending of Stravinsky's Symphonies of Wind Instruments . The winds, divided into four groups, are out of sight but play the real musical substance of Trans, dividing and re-combining in an attempt to assert themselves and break through into the listeners‚Äôs consciousness . The music is heard therefore despite the players who are visible, rather than because of them; the strings are more of a visual and acoustical obstruction to the music than its essence . Stockhausen sought in this way to pose a metaphysical situation, inasmuch as the audience is made to feel \\"the important thing is there in the back, but it cannot be seen\\", and so the listener is constantly confronted with the question of whether the sound being heard is from an orchestra that is merely being played back from a recording, or one that truly is there . Over the course of the work the dramatic balance significantly changes from the initial situation of conflict (which the composer characterized as \\"tragic\\") toward an increasingly \\"comic\\" dialogue between the concealed and the revealed . Musical form and content The early sketches for Trans show that Stockhausen initially considered using the formula technique he had recently (and very successfully) developed for Mantra. In the end, however, he decided against it, and settled instead on a simple pitch sequence of thirty-six notes without formal or rhythmic implications, which is \\"treated with inspired flexibility\\", first a twelve-tone row in a sharply falling contour, and then a gradually rising, winding chromatic line . The music consists of three main layers, differentiated by audible characteristics, but in part by the visual aspects as well. The first layer is played back invisibly on tape in the theatre, and consists of the loudly amplified sound of a loom shuttle crossing the room, left-to-right and right-to-left, at first occurring at nearly periodic intervals of about 20 seconds . Over the course of the piece the intervals between these sounds deviate increasingly from this average, following a systematic process . These sounds mark off segments of the music similar to the colotomic percussion signals used in some Asian musics, such as Japanese gagaku. Stockhausen had used this device previously in Mantra and Telemusik . There are 33 of these smaller subsections, grouped into six large sections, with a clear evolutionary process . The shuttle-loom sounds also indicate the structural levels, according to whether they occur singly, in pairs, or‚Äîat the dividing points between the six main sections of the work‚Äîin threes . Each of the four concealed wind groups consists of a bass instrument, which plays either a fundamental tone or a second or fourth harmonic above a virtual fundamental, and four treble instruments that provide a cluster of higher harmonics. For example, the first subsection has the central tone E, initially expressed as a fundamental tone on the second E below the bass clef (41.25 Hz), which is the lowest note of the contrabass. Above this the four flutes of Group I play harmonics 14, 15, 16, and 18, giving way to a second chord in the four oboes of Group II, playing harmonics 13, 15, 16, and 19. The fundamental note then drops by an octave, so that the sounding bass E becomes a second harmonic, with the four clarinets of Group III playing harmonics 16, 17, 21, and 22. The low E then becomes a fourth harmonic of an implied fundamental yet another octave lower, at 10.3 Hz, and the cup-muted trumpets in Group IV play harmonics 20, 21, 23, and 28. The behaviour of these harmonic tones, which roughly parallel the bass-tone fundamentals, resembles early medieval organum, but appears to be modelled on organ mixture stops, rather than on the formant resonances of the human voice, which remain in the same frequency zone while the fundamentals change below (; ). Because the winds and percussion are concealed from view (apart from the brief appearances of the solo trumpet and the military drummer), Stockhausen wondered whether people could tell the difference if those parts were just played back on tape. Even though he believed that it would matter, at least during inspired interpretations , he authorised performances in which the wind-instrument parts are played back from a recording. Understandably, given the economics of rehearsals and tight deadlines, orchestras have overwhelmingly opted for the pre-recorded winds (; ). Such performances are not entirely without their dangers, however. In 1987, Stockhausen criticised one of them for over- amplification, distorted playback, poor balance, and unnaturally strong high frequencies. The technicians in charge complained bitterly that the tape was defective, possibly due to copies made without using the correct noise- reduction equalisation, though they had taken no steps to obtain a better copy. Stockhausen also considered it possible that the inputs to the sound- mixing board may have been over-driven (; ). Reception Stockhausen, 2 September 1972 The audience reactions at the world premiere can be heard on the published recording, where parts of the public are clearly provoked. However, at Donaueschingen and Darmstadt in those days it was fashionable‚Äîas it had been earlier in Paris and Vienna‚Äîto boo in order to be seen booing . It was much the same ten days later at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville in Paris, when Trans was performed twice by the Orchestra of the Conservatory under the direction of Alain Louvrier. It was met with a storm of both applause and protest from a sold-out, youthful audience ‚Äîor, as phrased by a less enthusiastic critic: \\"it received ‚Ä¶ only a mixed reception\\" . Just two years later, at a performance of Trans in Metz in November 1973, there was no such audience hostility . Today, the outraged protests in the recording of the world premiere, predictably most vehement during the extremely long, intimidating silence toward the end (punctuated in the middle by a triple shuttle-loom stroke), open a window to the past, as if the listener now is experiencing the work in reality from \\"the other side\\" . Reviews have focussed on the theatrical elements, rather than on the music per se‚Äîunderstandably, since Trans is not intended as a concert piece, but rather is an experience that sets its own standards . One critic, writing of the 1973 Metz performance, pronounced it \\"very good theatre\\", a \\"beautifully and absorbingly done\\" transcription of dream to performance, possessing \\"the lunatic coherence that one recognizes in one‚Äôs own dreams\\" . A review of the 1971 Paris performance found the \\"strange haze of violent light\\", the hidden winds, the crack of the shuttle, and generally surrealist character to have an intense imaginative life . The staging has been described as an \\"intensely physical\\", multilayered experience that draws the listener through a perceptual gateway into \\"a mysterious auditory hinterland\\", suggesting Hamlet-like resignation less than the haunting pessimism of Francis Bacon . Critics are rarely unanimous, however. For example, when Trans was played in November 2008 in London (twice on the same programme), one journalist dismissed it as \\"inane play-acting\\", \\"the kind of piece Ligeti might have brought off with scathing wit\\" but in Stockhausen‚Äôs hands merely an example of \\"trying on the emperor's new clothes\\" . By contrast, another found Stockhausen to be \\"clearly in territory that was utterly and crazily his own\\" and the work \\"staged with properly mystifying flair\\" . For a third, Trans was \\"The highlight of the weekend, ‚Ä¶ precise and carefully composed, ‚Ä¶ a musical ceremonial that was grand, playful and touching at once\\" .

The thecal sac contains the cerebrospinal fluid which provides nutrients and buoyancy to the spinal cord. From the skull the tube adheres to bone at the foramen magnum and extends down to the second sacral vertebra where it tapers to cover over the filum terminale. Along most of the spinal canal it is separated from the inner surface by the epidural space. The sac has projections that follow the spinal nerves along their paths out of the vertebral canal which become the dural root sheaths.  Clinical significance  The lumbar cistern is part of the subarachnoid space. It is the space within the thecal sac which extends from below the end of the spinal cord (the conus medularis), typically at the level of the first to second lumbar vertebrae down to tapering of the dura at the level of the second sacral vertebra. The dura is pierced with a needle during a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). For epidural anesthesia an anesthetic agent is injected into the space just outside the thecal sac and diffuses through the dura to the nerve roots where they exit the thecal sac. For spinal anaesthesia in general, an injection can be given intrathecally into the subarachnoid space, or into the spinal canal. This route of administration may also be used for the delivery of drugs which will evade the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Disruption of the dural sac may occur as a complication of a medical procedure, or as a consequence of trauma causing a cerebrospinal fluid leak, or spontaneously resulting in a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak. If the spinal cord is not free to move within the thecal sac due to abnormal tissue attachments, especially during growth, tethered spinal cord syndrome may occur. In a split cord malformation, some portion of the spinal cord is divided into parallel halves. The thecal sac may be divided and surround each half with a spike of cartilage or bone dividing the halves (Type I), or both halves may be present within the same sac where the dura is bound to a band of fibrous tissue (Type II).

In 1918, Lewis was elected a member of the American Astronomical Society. She was also a member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. Early life Isabel Eleanor Martin was born in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, on July 11, 1881. Lewis earned her A.B. from Cornell University in 1903 and earned her A.M. there in 1905, specializing in mathematics. From 1905 to 1907 she was an \\"astronomical computer\\" for Simon Newcomb. Under Newcomb, Martin worked on eclipse data, an experience that would prove essential to her later work. Lewis began work as a computer at the Nautical Almanac Office in 1908. Although Lewis was not the first woman to be hired by the Naval Observatory (this was Maria Mitchell, who in 1849 was hired as a computer), Lewis was the first woman to be hired as assistant astronomer. At the NAO, Lewis met her husband, Clifford Spencer Lewis, another astronomer. They were married on December 4, 1912. Popularization of science With the birth of her son, Raymond Winslow Lewis, Lewis worked only part-time at the observatory and began an effort to popularize science. Writing three books and countless articles, Lewis started in 1916 to reach out to a popular audience about the wonders of astronomy and earth science. Her columns appeared in the New York Evening Sun, the Electrical Experimenter (later known as Science and Invention), Popular Astronomy, The Scientific Monthly, and the Astronomical Journal, among others. For thirty years, Lewis had a monthly column in Nature Magazine (this title was published by the American Nature Association and should not be confused with the journal Nature). Introducing her first article in Electrical Experimenter, editor Hugo Gernsback praised Lewis for her exactitude and learning, saying that she \\"has the rare faculty of interpreting difficult and dry subjects in a popular manner.\\"Gernsback, Hugo. Introduction to \\"Popular Astronomy: Dark Stars\\" by Isabel M. Lewis. The Electrical Experimenter, July 1918. The articles from the Sun were combined into a 1919 book, Splendors of the Sky, and her articles before 1922 in Science and Invention were included in the second part of her book Astronomy for Young Folks. In addition, in \\"News of the Stars\\" she gave lectures on the local radio station (WRC) and made presentations at schools and churches. Return to full-time work Lewis returned to full-time work after her husband's death in 1927. On October 1, 1927 Lewis was promoted to Assistant Scientist. Lewis was further promoted to the rank of Astronomer in 1930. A specialist in eclipses, at the Naval Observatory Lewis derived a faster and more accurate method to determine where an eclipse would be visible. She also found a way to predict more occultations of the moon; these moments when the moon passed before other heavenly bodies were used to investigate the moon's orbit. Her new method for calculating solar eclipses allowed for a level of detail that could be used to understand the ionosphere. During this period, she participated in expeditions to view the solar eclipse of June 19, 1936 in Russia. Also, she organized and participated in the Hayden Planetarium-Grace Eclipse Expedition to Peru to view, photograph, and broadcast by radio the solar eclipse of June 8, 1937.Bennett, Dorothy A. \\"The Hayden Planetarium-Grace Eclipse Expedition\\".

However, the more precise legal usage of international child abduction originates in private international law and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, \\"illegal\\" is normally taken to mean \\"in breach of custodial rights\\" and \\"home\\" is defined as the child's habitual residence. As implied by the \\"breach of custodial rights,\\" the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional conflict of laws whereby multiple authorities and jurisdictions could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous children's rights, and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind. There is a common misconception that because the abductor in these cases is usually not a stranger the children are not in danger. The harmful consequences for children and families have been shown in several studies and child abduction has been characterized as a form of parental alienation and child abuse.Parental Child Abduction is Child Abuse . Nancy Faulkner, Ph.D. Presented to the United Nations Convention on Child Rights in Special Session, June 9, 1999 Adding international dimensions to the detrimental effects of child abduction significantly increases the detrimental effects on children and families. The modern day ease of international travel and corollary increase in international marriages is leading to a rapid rise in the number of international child abductions. Definition International child abduction occurs when one parent unlawfully takes (or retains) a minor child in a country other than the one the child has his/her habitual residence. If that country is a party to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (applicable to children under 16), then the child will usually be returned to the country of origin. If there is a conflict of law between two countries, the guardian must follow the laws of the country where the child physically present. It is very common that a parent that has legal custody of the child in the country where the child physically present, is wanted for parental abduction in another country. In such cases the child cannot be removed from the country where the child physically present, before child custody ends at age 18, because otherwise the child will not be returned to the taking parent. This does not have anything to do with children's rights or welfare, only parental rights. According to the law the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This would also be the case if the child does not want the taking parent to go to jail and does not want have anything to do with the left behind parent. Children have no say in a child custody dispute involving themselves even when they turn 18 years old and are legal adults and child custody becomes moot and mootness. According to the law when the child is 18 or older, it legally does not make a difference if child is returned, because child custody becomes moot and mootness. Further legal proceedings with regard to it can have no effect. For example it is a criminal offense under United States federal law for the Japanese mother to take and or retain her children in Japan, while under Japanese law it is a criminal offense for the American father to take the same children back to the United States. According to the law of there respective country both parents are correct. Because the children are in Japan both parents must comply with Japanese law (not American law). Both parents are only concerned over there parental rights not children's welfare.  Origin of the term  What is today called \\"parental kidnapping,\\" \\"international child abduction,\\", \\"parental child abduction\\" and \\"parental child trafficking\\" has existed as long as different legal jurisdictions and international borders have‚Äîthough often under different names. None of these names achieved the modern day broad acceptance of terms like international child abduction. Lacking a common set of terminology or specifically designed laws to address the, at the time, poorly defined problem, researchers on the history of cross-border child abduction must search for terms like \\"custodial interference,\\" \\"contempt of child custody orders,\\" \\"legal kidnapping\\" or, in cases where children were viewed more as property than as individual subjects of rights, name variations on theft, child-maintenance debt and smuggling, among others. Lawmakers struggled to typify and discuss international child abduction and discussions at the Hague Conference on Private International Law noted that, what some were referring to with variations on \\"legal kidnapping,\\" was an oxymoron since that which is legal cannot be kidnapping and that which is kidnapping cannot be legal. The response to these concerns was the coining of the term \\"international child abduction.\\" The terms first prominent use was in the title of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The term is not, however, used anywhere in the actual text of the convention itself in preference of the more technical terms \\"wrongful removal\\" or \\"wrongful retention\\" which were better suited for describing the mechanics of the Convention's system. The use of the term is now widespread in international law. Internationalization of family law In all family law disputes a determination must be made as to which legal systems and laws should be applied to the dispute. This question becomes much more complicated when aspects, or parties, of the case occur in, or hail from, multiple legal jurisdictions. Today's international family law norms were heavily influenced by the concepts of domicile and nationality. In Europe these ideas were refined during the nineteenth century by Italian politician, Pasquale Mancini, who believed matters of personal status were to be governed by the nationality of the person. During the same period in the US and Latin America the prevailing principle was that jurisdiction over personal matters was determined by domicile which, in the Americas, was acquired immediately upon moving to a foreign jurisdiction even if neither citizenship nor nationality were acquired. Starting in the late eighteenth century until the early 1920s a number of efforts were made to develop a series of international treaties governing international conflicts of law in Europe. Treaties that favored nationality as the determining jurisdictional factor either never got of the ground, were not widely signed or had substantial practical problems with countries renouncing them after signing. At the same time the inter-American system in Latin America produced the Bustamante Code of 1928 and the Montevideo Conventions of 1939 and 1940. Of particular note in these later Conventions was the introduction of a definition of \\"domicile\\" that started with a reference to the \\"habitual residence\\" for civil status. Lessons learned in prior efforts to create successful multilateral treaties culminated in a number of successful treaties in the mid-1900s, such as the 1961 Convention on the Protection of Minors, the New York Convention of 1956 on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance drafted under the auspices of the United Nations, and the Hague Convention of 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of minors (\\"1961 Convention.\\") The 1961 Convention brought an innovation in terminology by creating a compromise between advocates of \\"nationality\\" as the determining factor for jurisdiction and advocates for the modern fact-centric model of \\"habitual residence.\\" It also included expanded language to encompass both judicial and administrative authorities in response to the Boll case, in which Sweden claimed its public administrative law was exempt from the 1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors because it only governed domestic private judicial law and not public administrative law. The 1961 Convention also emphasized the concept of the \\"interests of the child\\" as a basis for authorities of the child's nationality to overrule the authorities of the child's habitual residence. Of particularly special note, the drafters of the 1961 Convention expressly considered a provision addressing the removal of a child from their habitual residence with an intent to evade rightful jurisdiction‚Äîprimarily for child custody reasons. This first attempt to codify international child abduction failed due to an inability to agree on a definition or manner of describing the phenomenon, with a number of countries that adhered to the principle of nationality regulating personal child and family law unable to classify their nationals removing children from foreign countries to their home state as fraudulent evasion. In actual cases of international child abduction, this lack of a specific provision on child abduction in the 1961 treaty resulted in countries regularly interpreting the \\"habitual residence\\" concept of the Convention in a manner that allowed parents to take children to a foreign country and immediately acquire \\"habitual residence.\\" This allowed judicial forum shopping and created perverse incentives for removing children from their homes to foreign jurisdictions in order to game the family law system and obtain a more favorable custodial outcome than could be gained in the jurisdiction of the child's home. In the 1970s, dissatisfaction with these results led to efforts to create conventions on the foreign recognition and enforcement of judgments to make it harder for courts to favor a parent solely because that parent is a national suing in his or her home state. Canada also proposed that the Hague Conference work on a Convention to address what it termed \\"legal kidnapping.\\" The Hague received Canada's request enthusiastically and, inspired by a Swiss proposal originally submitted at the Council of Europe in 1976 coined a new term in international family law ‚Äì \\"international child abduction.\\" Although the problem of international child abduction was well understood, finding a way to address the problem in practice was exceedingly difficult, but the Swiss proposal had a solution that was elegant in its simplicity. Why not simply restore the status quo ante?  The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction  In 1980 the Hague Conference drafted a convention to address the problem of international child abduction: the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ‚Äì commonly referred to as the Abduction Convention. The Swiss idea of restoring the status quo ante after a \\"wrongful removal\\" or \\"wrongful retention\\" became a mainstay of the Abduction Convention. Under the convention, an application could be made for the return of a child who had been wrongfully removed or retained so long as the applicant possessed rights of custody, and provided that those rights were being \\"actually exercised\\" at the time of the abduction. The concept of \\"actually exercised\\" in reference to custodial rights itself was an innovation in terminology. Having met these requirements a child was to be returned \\"forthwith\\" except in exceptional circumstances. Inspired by the Hague Evidence Convention and the Hague Service Convention's of 1965 and 1970, the Abduction Convention required the establishment of a single Central Authority in each country that would handle two-way communications with domestic courts, administrative agencies and foreign central authorities. Furthermore, each central authority was required to take \\"any and all actions\\" to secure the goals of the treaty and cooperate with other central authorities to do the same. All of these new obligations emphasized the need for international cooperation amongst state parties in achieving the objectives of the convention.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child  Established in 1989 the Convention on the Rights of the Child reflected the growing international consensus that children be viewed as a subject of rights and not merely as an object of rights or of protective action. The UNCRC roused an unprecedented response with 187 countries ratifying it within seven years forming an essential backdrop in international children's law. Article 11 of the Convention explicitly requires State Parties to combat the illicit transfer and retention of children and promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements or accession to existing agreements that do so, Article 35 stipulates that \\"States Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction, sale or traffic of children for any purpose or in any form.\\"  The Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation  The 1996 Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co- operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures is the third of the modern Hague Conventions on international family law, following in the footsteps of the Abduction Convention and the Adoption Convention. It is much broader in scope than the first two conventions and covers a wide range of civil measures related to the protection of children including: orders concerning parental responsibility and contact, public measures of protection or care, matters of legal representation and the protection of children's property. The Convention has uniform rules determining which country's authorities are competent to take the necessary measures of protection. The Convention also determines which country's laws are to be applied and provides for the recognition and enforcement of measures taken in one Contracting State in all the other Contracting States. The co-operation provisions of the Convention provide the basic framework for the exchange of information and the necessary degree of collaboration between administrative authorities in the Contracting States. Reflecting an ever-increasing emphasis on the need for international cooperation as an essential element in the success of these measures the Convention has a full chapter on cooperation consisting of eleven articles. Although initially slow to gain support and plagued with political problems, the number of states acceding to it has begun to grow.  Impact on society, families and children  Cover of a US report on International Child Abduction (2007) As the result of the harmful effects on children, parental kidnapping has been characterized as a form of child abuse and an extreme form of parental alienation. Abducted children suffer emotionally and sometimes physically at the hands of their abducting parents. Many are told the other parent is dead or has abandoned them. Uprooted from their entire life, home, family and friends, abducted children are often even given new names by their abductors and instructed to hide their real names or where they used to live. Generally the abductor avoids mentioning the victim parent and waits for time to erase difficult questions, such as \\"When can we see mom/dad again?\\". These children become hostages. It is beyond their comprehension that a parent who truly cares and loves them cannot discover their whereabouts. Childhood cannot be recaptured. Abductions rob a child of their sense of history, intimacy, values and morals, self-awareness, opportunity of knowing one's beginnings and the love and contact of extended family‚Äîa loss no child possesses the ability to protect themselves against. Huntington (1982) lists some of the deleterious effects of abduction on child victims: # Depression; # Loss of community; # Loss of stability, security, and trust; # Excessive fearfulness, even of ordinary occurrences; # Loneliness; # Anger; # Helplessness; # Disruption in identity formation; and # Fear of abandonment. Many of these effects can be subsumed by the problems relevant to reactive attachment disorder, stress, fear of abandonment, learned helplessness, and guilt. The extended support systems of abducting and victim parents can also become part of the dispute. Believing primarily one side of the abduction story, family, friends, and professionals in each parents individual country may lose their objectivity. As a result, protective concerns expressed by the abandoned parent may be viewed as undue criticism, interference, and histrionics preventing the victim parent from effectively relieving the trauma imposed on their innocent child by the abduction.  Mediation in child abduction cases  Mediation is a process during which abductors and the left behind family, assisted by mediator(s), attempt to resolve conflicts independent of the judicial system. Mediators create a constructive atmosphere for discussions and ensure fair dealings between parents. The mediators do not make decisions; instead, they confine themselves to assisting the parties in working out for themselves a fair and sensible solution to their problems. More specifically, the mediation can address not only the child's primary residence, but also the child's contact with both parents, visitation arrangements, agreements concerning the child's maintenance, schooling, further education, bi-cultural and bi-lingual upbringing, necessary arrangements for financial support etc. Mediation can be helpful in international child abduction cases. Reunite research 2012 In the context of mediation families can deal with the question of return and also find solutions to other issues relating to their children.  Legal justifications for abduction  International law has generally recognized that there may be extenuating circumstances where a child abduction may have been necessary or justifiable due to extenuating circumstances. The 1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors limited such considerations to strictly emergency situations. Starting with the 1924 Declaration on the Rights of the Child and the 1959 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child there was a growing recognition at the international level of the shift in nation's domestic laws away from parental authority and towards an emphasis on protecting the child, even from their own parents. This foreshadowed the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and led to the establishment of exceptional circumstances in Article 13 of the Hague Abduction Convention where the removal of children would not be considered child abduction and allow the child to remain in their new country.  Abduction Convention: \\"Grave risks of harm\\" and \\"intolerable situations\\"  The principal purpose of the Abduction Convention is to cause the prompt return of a child to his or her \\"habitual residence.\\" In certain exceptional cases under Article 13b, the court's mandatory return obligation is changed to a discretionary obligation, specifically, \\"the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\\" It is important to note that the duty to return a child is not abrogated by a finding under Art. 13(b) but merely changes from mandatory to discretionary. Since the general intent of the Convention is to cause the return of a child to his or her \\"habitual residence,\\" unless there are some powerful and compelling reasons otherwise the court is normally and routinely expected to exercise its discretion and return the child to his or her \\"habitual residence\\". In the primary source of interpretation for the Convention, the Explanatory Report, Professor E. Perez-Vera noted the following: > \\"it would seem necessary to underline the fact that the three types of > exception to the rule concerning the return of the child must be applied > only so far as they go and no further. This implies above all that they are > to be interpreted in a restrictive fashion if the Convention is not to > become a dead letter. In fact, the Convention as a whole rests upon the > unanimous rejection of this phenomenon of illegal child removals and upon > the conviction that the best way to combat them at an international level is > to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practical application of this > principle requires that the signatory States be convinced that they belong, > despite their differences, to the same legal community within which the > authorities of each State acknowledge that the authorities of one of them ‚Äì > those of the child's habitual residence ‚Äì are in principle best placed to > decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic > invocation of the said exceptions, substituting the forum chosen by the > abductor for that of the child's residence, would lead to the collapse of > the whole structure of the Convention by depriving it of the spirit of > mutual confidence which is its inspiration.\\" In spite of the spirit and intent of the Convention as conveyed by the Convention itself and further reinforced by the Perez-Vera report, Article 13b is frequently used by abductors as a vehicle to litigate the child's best interests or custody. Although Article 13(b) inquiries are not intended to deal with issues or factual questions appropriate for custody proceedings, many countries use article 13b to request psychological profiles, detailed evaluations of parental fitness, evidence concerning lifestyle and the nature and quality of relationships. These misinterpretations of the Abduction Convention's exceptions have rendered the Convention largely ineffective in accomplishing its objectives. The best interests of a child, which is explicitly never mentioned in the Convention, is an essentially subjective standard that judges often use to facilitate foreign nations' manipulation of the treaty and create a pretext for discretionary decisions. This discretion often takes the form of gender, cultural and national biases. The result is substantive non-compliance with the Abduction Convention.  Domestic violence  Domestic Violence At the time the Hague Abduction Convention was drafted domestic violence was never explicitly considered as an affirmative defense for child abduction, although it may be brought as a defense under Article 13, if \\"there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\\" Article 13 supposed that the child's primary caretaker would abduct the child to escape the domestic violence of a non-custodial parent. At the time of the Conventions drafting, joint custody laws were rare. One parent was usually both the custodial parent and primary caretaker while the other, non-custodial parent had rights of access. The move towards joint custody laws conferred both the parent who acted as the primary caretaker and their ex-partner with custodial rights and, by extension, a right to request the return of children wrongfully removed from their place of habitual residence. In addition to not accounting for a shift in child custody law towards shared parenting and joint custody, according to Weiner, the framers of the Convention also did little to account for the motivation for abducting a child, generally assuming that all abductions were harmful to children; however, the child's primary caretaker may be fleeing with a child to protect himself or herself from a dangerous domestic situation. Global Missing Children‚Äôs Network Launched in 1998 as a joint venture of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) and the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Global Missing Children's Network (GMCN) is a network of countries that connect, share best practices, and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations. The Network has 22 member countries: Albania, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the US. Each country can access a customizable website platform, and can enter missing children information into a centralized, multilingual database that has photos of and information about missing children, which can be viewed and distributed to assist in location and recovery efforts.\\"New Zealand Police joins Global Missing Children's Network\\", New Zealand Police.

It was discovered on 1 January 1989, by Japanese astronomer Yoshiaki Oshima at the Gekko Observatory, east of Shizuoka, Japan. The assumed C-type asteroid belongs to the 90 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 19.9 hours. It has not yet been named since its numbering in July 1992.  Orbit and classification  ' is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.8‚Äì5.6 AU once every 11 years and 9 months (4,303 days; semi-major axis of 5.18 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Gekko Observatory in January 1989.  Eurybates family  ' is the member of the small Eurybates family (), named after its parent body, 3548 Eurybates. This asteroid family comprises 218 known members of carbonaceous and/or primitive composition, and is one of only a few families identified among the Jovian asteroids; with four of them in the Greek camp. This potentially collisional family was first characterized by Jakub Rozehnal and Miroslav Bro≈æ in 2011, and further described in 2014. Other members of this family include the Jupiter trojans 8060 Anius, 9818 Eurymachos, , and 360072 Alcimedon. In the HCM analysis by Milani and Kne≈æeviƒá, however, ' belongs to the background population.  Physical characteristics  ' is an assumed, carbonaceous C-type asteroid. The overall spectral type of members of the Eurybates family is that of a C- and P-type. It has a high V‚ÄìI color index of 1.01.  Rotation period  In April 2015, the so-far only lightcurve was obtained by Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies in Landers, California. The photometric observations gave a rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.14 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer, ' measures 53.28 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.052, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 50.77 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.2.

He joined the German Army when World War I began. He is one of the leading German war poets of the First World War, and has been compared with English poet Wilfred Owen. After the war he became an editor for numerous publications. He was one of the 88 writers who pledged their allegiance to Adolf Hitler in October 1933 in a Vow of Most Faithful Allegiance (Gel√∂bnis treuester Gefolgschaft). Early life Schnack was born in Rieneck, Lower Franconia, Bavaria. He was the third child of a station commander of the German gendarmerie. His older brother Friedrich Schnack (1888‚Äì1977) also became a writer, known for his works on natural history and children's literature. Schack followed his father's official postings around Bavaria, to Dettelbach, Kronach and Hammelburg. He attended the Progymnasium in Hammelburg (predecessor of the Frobenius-Gymnasium Hammelburg). He became a journalist, and worked in Halberstadt and Bolzano. First World War poetry Schnack served in the Imperial German Army during the First World War. He was wounded in 1916. He began to publish poetry in Die Aktion in 1915, but only published poetry on war subjects from 1917. His first war poem was \\"Schwester Maria\\" (\\"Sister Maria\\"), published in Die Aktion in January 1917. He continued to publish war poems in three collections that he published in 1919, Strophen der Gier (\\"Verses of greed\\"), Der Abenteurer (\\"The adventurer\\") and Die tausend Gel√§chter (\\"The thousand laughs\\"). He published his most significant collection of war poetry, Tier rang gewaltig mit Tier (\\"Beast strove mightily with beast\\") in 1920, in a limited edition of 1,000 copies. This short work of around 80 pages contains 60 poems based on the sonnet form, on themes of night and death. In his 1985 book in German war poetry, Patrick Bridgwater, Emeritus Professor of German at the University of Durham, described Schnack's book as \\"the best single collection produced by a German war poet in 1914-1918\\", and one work, \\"N√§chtliche Landschaft\\", as the \\"best poem of the war written in German\\". His poem \\"Verdun\\" was published in 1919 in the first edition of the socialist journal Das Tribunal. He also wrote a remarkable poem about desertion, entitled Der √úberlaufer (\\"The deserter\\"). Later life After the end of the First World War, he became an editor in Darmstadt. From 1920 to 1925, he was a literary editor and theatre critic for the Neuen Badischen Landes-Zeitung in Mannheim. He married Maria Gl√∂ckler on 24 October 1924. He travelled in France, Italy and Dalmatia before returning to Mannheim and then settled in Berchtesgaden. He was one of the 88 writers who pledged their allegiance to Adolf Hitler in October 1933 in a Vow of Most Faithful Allegiance (Gel√∂bnis treuester Gefolgschaft).88 \\"writers\\", from Letters of Heinrich and Thomas Mann, 1900-1949, Volume 12 of Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism, University of California Press 1998 , p. 367-8 He published lighter popular works in the 1930s and 1940s, including his 1935 work Kleines Lesebuch. In addition to his poetry, he also wrote some short plays, a few novellas and two novels, Zugv√∂gel der Liebe (1936) and Der finstere Franz (1937). His later works have less literary merit, and are overshadowed by his support for the Nazis. He moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1937, and joined the Wehrmacht (German Army) in 1944. He was captured by US forces. After the Second World War, he settled to Kahl am Main, where he later died in 1973.

Peter McGraw is a professor of Marketing and Psychology at the University of Colorado Boulder. As a behavioral scientist his research spans the fields of judgment and decision making, emotion, affect, mood, and behavioral economics. McGraw's early work examined the interplay of judgment, emotion, and choice, with an emphasis on moral judgment, mixed emotions, and behavioral economics. For example, McGraw and Jonathan Levav have published work based on their theory of Emotional Accounting, which is a complement to prior research on Mental accounting. Emotional Accounting posits that people use their feelings about money to guide how they spend it. One of the findings of the work suggests that people have negative feelings about a windfall of money, they tend to make utilitarian or virtuous expenditures in lieu of hedonic expenditures. More recently, McGraw has examined the antecedents and consequences of humor‚Äîwork that has helped move the study of humor from the niche to the mainstream. One advantage that he has over his predecessors is his ability to conduct state-of-the-art experiments with the help of the team he directs at the Humor Research Lab (aka HuRL). With Caleb Warren, he has developed a theory of humor: the Benign Violation Theory. The theory suggests that humor occurs when a person simultaneously appraises a situation as wrong or threatening some way (i.e., a violation) and yet appraises the situation to be okay or acceptable in some way (i.e., benign). His popular TEDx talk, What makes things funny?‚Äù documents early insights from the benign violation theory. In 2014, McGraw co-authored The Humor Code, a book about the science of humor and his travels around the world with journalist Joel Warner. In 2015, McGraw created a live comedy game show‚ÄîFunny or True?‚Äîwhich pits scientists against comedians to see who has the best blend of brains and funny bone. In 2018, McGraw launched a podcast I‚ÄôM NOT JOKING that looks at the lives of comedians, improvisers, comedy writers, and other funny people from business, science, and the arts. McGraw gives public talks and keynotes on a range of topics, including humor, marketing management, and behavioral economics. His work appears in major media outlets, such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, CNN, NPR, BBC, TIME and Wired. He has written for Slate, Fortune, and Huffington Post. Academic career McGraw received his Ph.D. from The Ohio State University in 2002, at which time he pursued a post-doc at Princeton University with Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. In 2004, he joined the faculty at the Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder. In 2008, he received an appointment (courtesy) in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience. At the University of Colorado‚Äôs Leeds School of Business, he teaches courses in marketing management and behavioral economics. He also teaches for executive MBA programs at London Business School and the Rady School of Management at UC San Diego. He directs the Humor Research Lab (HuRL) and co-directs a virtual research lab, the Moral Research Lab (MoRL) with Daniel Bartels. His research has been published in the Journal of Consumer Research, Journal of Marketing Research, Management Science, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and Psychological Science. In 2007, McGraw was named a Marketing Science Institute Young Scholar. Outside academic pursuits, McGraw, from 2004 to 2010, served as academic coordinator, assistant coach, and associate head coach of the men's lacrosse team at the University of Colorado. He was the head coach of the men's lacrosse club at Princeton University from 2002 to 2004. Research Labs Humor Research Laboratory (HuRL) HuRL is dedicated to the scientific study of humor and its antecedents and consequences. The lab's theoretical and methodological base is in the interdisciplinary fields of consumer behavior, emotion, and judgment and decision making, with an emphasis in social and cognitive psychology. Moral Research Laboratory (MoRL) MoRL is a (virtual) research laboratory that investigates the mental processes underlying morally motivated judgment and choice, with a focus on consumer behavior and implications for public policy. The lab's theoretical base is in the interdisciplinary field of judgment and decision making, with an emphasis in social and cognitive psychology.  Shtick to Business  In 2020, McGraw published his second book, Shtick to Business: What the Masters of Comedy can Teach You about Breaking Rules, Being Fearless, and Building a Serious Career. Drawing on behavioral science research, case studies, and his own comedy successes, McGraw presents ‚Äúserious‚Äù business lessons from the masters of comedy. The Benign Violation Theory Building on the work of Thomas Veatch, McGraw and Caleb Warren introduced a benign violation account of humor. The benign violation theory explains humorous responses to a broad range of situations. The account holds that humor occurs when something perceived to threaten a person's well-being, identity, or normative belief structure (i.e., a violation) simultaneously seems okay or acceptable. Play fighting and tickling are prototypical examples of benign violations because both are physically threatening but harmless attacks. A particular strength of the theory is that it predicts when things are not funny: a situation can fail to be humorous because it depicts a violation that does not simultaneously seem benign, or because it depicts a benign situation that has no violation. For example, play fighting and tickling cease to elicit laughter either when the attack stops (strictly benign) or becomes too aggressive (malign violation). Jokes similarly fail to be funny when either they are too tame or too risqu√©. The Humor Code In 2010, McGraw met journalist Joel Warner, who was fascinated by McGraw's humor research and unified theory of humor. Starting in 2011, the two created \\"The Humor Code Project,\\" a two-year, 91,000-mile global search for what makes things funny. Their travels took them to Tanzania, Scandinavia, Japan, Israel, Peru, and several other destinations in North America. McGraw and Warner authored The Humor Code, a book about their travels and the experiments they conducted along the way. The two maintained multiple blogs about their adventures on Wired, Huffington Post, and Psychology Today. McGraw's research and the book have been widely covered by the media, including the Wall Street Journal, NPR, MSNBC, The Boston Globe, Scientific American, The Atlantic, Denver Post, and others.  I‚Äôm not joking  In 2018, McGraw launched a weekly podcast called I‚ÄôM NOT JOKING. The podcast looks into the lives of comedians, improvisers, comedy writers, and other funny people from business, science, and the arts. McGraw and his guest have a wide-ranging discussion of their habits, motivations, and secrets to success. Notable guests include Jimmy Carr, Wil Anderson, Neal Brennan, Gillian Cosgriff, and Gordon Southern. Funny or True? McGraw is the creator and host of a live comedy game show that pits comedians against scientists to determine who has the best blend of brains and funny bone. A panel of comedians and scientists answer brainy questions with two seemingly incompatible goals: 1) be funny and 2) seem smart. Answers are shown on the ‚ÄúBig Board‚Äù without attribution and the audience votes for the answer they think is 1) funniest and 2) ‚Äútruthiest.‚Äù The contestants‚Äô identities are subsequently revealed and points are awarded using a handicapping procedure. Scientists receive double points for being funniest. Comedians receive double points for being truthiest. The show has been performed in Boulder, Denver, and Los Angeles. Notable contestants include Neal Brennan and Alonzo Bodden. The funniest cities in the United States McGraw and his Humor Code co-author Joel Warner worked with Adrian Ward and Caleb Warren, and other members of the Humor Research Lab to create the Humor Algorithm, which ranked the 50 funniest cities in America. The team collected data for the project: *Frequency of visits to Cheezburger comedy websites, such as Lolcats and FAIL Blog *Number of comedy clubs per square mile in each city *Traveling comedians‚Äô ratings of each city's comedy- club audiences *Number of famous comedians born in each city, divided by city population *Number of famous funny tweeters living in each city, divided by city population *Number of comedy radio stations available in each city *Frequency of humor-related web searches originating in each city The team also conducted an extensive survey with more than 900 residents from the top ten cities determined by the objective measures above. To glean a deeper understanding of humorous daily life in these cities, researchers asked residents about the entertainment they enjoyed, asked whether they looked for humor in their friends and lovers, and subjected them to a ‚ÄúNeed for Levity‚Äù personality test. Chicago was deemed the funniest city in the United States.  Solo-The Single Persons‚Äô Guide to a Remarkable Life  In December 2019, McGraw launched his second podcast called Solo-The Singe Person‚Äôs Guide to a Remarkable Life. The podcast takes a positive view of single living. He interviews singles living remarkable lives and experts who provide advice to listeners.

Two years later she played at the Schauspielhaus Wuppertal. From 1970 to 1972, she appeared on stage at the Staatstheater Stuttgart then at the Schauspielhaus Bochum. During the season 1978‚Äì1979 Rosel Zech was active in Hamburg at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus and then returned to her native city of Berlin, where she acted on the Volksb√ºhne. In 1981 she was hired by the Bayerischen Staatsschauspiel in Munich. Four years later she was seen again at the Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. 2009 she worked with in the Luisenburg Festival in the play Mother Courage as Anna Fierlinger. Film and television She made her 1970 television debut in The Pot. In 1973 she appeared in a small role in The Tenderness of Wolves with Kurt Raab and Margit Carstensen. On the set she met Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who produced the film. She and Fassbinder began an extended collaboration. The same year, Peter Zadek cast the actress in his film version of Kleiner Mann ‚Äì was nun? (\\"Little man - what now?\\" with Heinrich Giskes and Hannelore Hoger. Other films and TV movies followed, among which were a film version of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull, and Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler. In the children's film Vorstadtkrokodile from 1977, she played Mrs. Wolferman, the mother of one of the \\"crocodiles\\". She appeared in Peter Fleischmann's 1979 science fiction film '. In 1981, she was cast by Rainer Werner Fassbinder in the film Lola (1981) in a supporting role as the wife of Mario Adorf. Fassbinder immediately chose her for his next project, Veronika Voss, and cast her in the lead. This second Fassbinder film was inspired by the life of the UFA actress Sybille Schmitz, and Rosel Zech's convincing portrayal of the morphine-addicted actress turned Zech into a star overnight. The film was awarded in 1982 in the Berlin International Film Festival with a Golden Bear. In the following years, Zech focused mainly on work in television and appeared in numerous television series and television films, as well as in regular theater productions in Berlin, where she lived during her last years. From 2002 until her death, she had a regular role as the mother superior in the German TV series Um Himmels Willen. Death She died of bone cancer in Berlin on 31 August 2011, aged 71. Following a cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2011, Zech had not been able to resume her regular role as a nun in the German TV series Um Himmels Willen (For Heaven's Sake).

It was founded in 1990 and is highly esteemed for the high quality of its work. Artistic Director of the ensemble since 2014 is Jesper L√ºtzh√∏ft while Pierre-Andr√© Valade is Principal Guest Conductor. The ensemble takes its name from J. R. R. Tolkien's fiktive Middle-earth plant Athelas, a herb with healing powers twice used by Aragorn to save Frodo in the Lord of the Rings. History Athelas Sinfonietta Copenhagen was founded in 1990 by two composers and a conductor out of frustration that no existing orchestras took an interest in performing new compositions. From 1997-2000, when he set off to lead the Copenhagen Philharmonic, Giordano Bellincampi was chief conductor. In 2000 it was appointed as National ensemble, a status followed by considerable extra subsidies from the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. In 2001 the ensemble collaborated with Thomas Sandberg and the composer Anders Nordentoft on the experimental opera performance On the Planet. 2003 saw crisis when it lost its status due to ministerial budget cuts, and the subsidies dwindled to one third of previous levels, while most of the leadership retired. Anders Beyer was appointed as new artistic director of the ensemble. He introduced several initiatives to make the ensemble more visible and establish new collaborations. In 2008 Athelas Sinfonietta Copenhagen collaborated with Danish Dance Theatre on the installation Labyrint created by Tim Rushton. On 4 May 2009, joined for the occasion by the singer Misen Groth, the ensemble performed Jacob Groth score for the film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Cannes as the official opening concert of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.

It lends its name to the Barstovian North American land mammal age (NALMA). The sediments are fluvial and lacustrine in origin except for nine layers of rhyolitic tuff. It is well known for its abundant vertebrate fossils including bones, teeth and footprints.Lindsay, E.H. (1972). Small Mammal Fossils from the Barstow Formation, California. University of California Publications in Geological Sciences, Vol. 93. University of California Press, Berkeley. The formation is also renowned for the fossiliferous concretions in its upper member, which contain three- dimensionally preserved arthropods. Fossils= Arthropods  The arthropods in the upper member of the Barstow Formation are preserved in concretions. The concretions are calcareous and range from 0.125 cm3 to 125 cm3. The fossils are typically three-dimensional and, on occasion, exhibit internal anatomy. Due to the preservation of soft-tissue, the Barstow Formation has been identified as a Konservat-Lagerst√§tte deposit. The fauna was first recognized in 1954 by Allen M. Basset and Allison \\"Pete\\" R. Palmer.Palmer, A.R., Basset, A.M. (1954). Nonmarine Miocene arthropods from California. Science, Vol. 102, p.228-229 The concretions from the Barstow Formation preserve both allochthonous arthropod communities and rare autochthonous arthropod communities. Over 21 orders of arthropods have been recorded. The fossil assemblage is dominated by Diptera (Dasyhelea australis antiqua), Coleoptera (Schistomerus californese), and Anostraca (Archaebranchinecta barstowensis).

Its facts and grammar may be valid, but its content is deemed to be at odds with the interests of the paper, or the paper's interpretation of what is good for its community. A spiking may be permanent, or temporary, depending on what instigated it, and whether the objection(s) can be overcome. Some examples would be a story that while factually correct would likely incite a powerful local politician, upset a valuable advertiser in that paper, or bring unwanted attention to a community. The editorial staff, or if preempted, the newspaper ownership or management, must balance all its interests against purely theoretical \\"journalistic integrity\\". Conflicts involving spiking often arise from stories being pursued as part of investigative journalism, or which threaten to bring on a libel lawsuit (that could prove expensive to fight even if groundless).

(where contestants register) at the Kansas Free Fair, in Topeka, KS.Eugenics, the set of beliefs and practices which aims at improving the genetic quality of the human population, played a significant role in the history and culture of the United States during the Progressive Era, from the late 19th century until US involvement in World War II. While ostensibly about improving genetic quality, it has been argued that eugenics was more about preserving the position of the dominant groups in the population. Scholarly research has determined that people who found themselves targets of the eugenics movement were those who were seen as unfit for society‚Äîthe poor, the disabled, the mentally ill, and specific communities of color‚Äîand a disproportionate number of those who fell victim to eugenicists' sterilization initiatives were women who identified as African American, Hispanic, or Native American. As a result, the United States' Progressive-era eugenics movement is now generally associated with racist and nativist elements, as the movement was to some extent a reaction to demographic and population changes, as well as concerns over the economy and social well- being, rather than scientific genetics.  History = Early proponents  The American eugenics movement was rooted in the biological determinist ideas of Sir Francis Galton, which originated in the 1880s. In 1883, Sir Francis Galton first used the word eugenics to describe scientifically, the biological improvement of genes in human races and the concept of being \\"well-born\\". He believed that differences in a person's ability were acquired primarily through genetics and that eugenics could be implemented through selective breeding in order for the human race to improve in its overall quality, therefore allowing for humans to direct their own evolution. In the US, eugenics was largely supported after the discovery of Mendel's law lead to a widespread interest in the idea of breeding for specific traits. Galton studied the upper classes of Britain, and arrived at the conclusion that their social positions could be attributed to a superior genetic makeup.Selden, 2005: p. 202. U.S. eugenicists tended to believe in the genetic superiority of Nordic, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon peoples, supported strict immigration and anti-miscegenation laws, and supported the forcible sterilization of the poor, disabled and \\"immoral.\\"Ordover, 2003: p. xii. Eugenics supporters hold signs criticizing various \\"genetically inferior\\" groups. Wall Street, New York, c. 1915. The American eugenics movement received extensive funding from various corporate foundations including the Carnegie Institution, Rockefeller Foundation, and the Harriman railroad fortune. In 1906 J.H. Kellogg provided funding to help found the Race Betterment Foundation in Battle Creek, Michigan. The Eugenics Record Office (ERO) was founded in Cold Spring Harbor, New York in 1911 by the renowned biologist Charles B. Davenport, using money from both the Harriman railroad fortune and the Carnegie Institution. As late as the 1920s, the ERO was one of the leading organizations in the American eugenics movement.Bender, 2009: p. 192. In years to come, the ERO collected a mass of family pedigrees and provided training for eugenics field workers who were sent to analyze individuals at various institutions, such as mental hospitals and orphanage institutions, across the United States. Eugenicists such as Davenport, the psychologist Henry H. Goddard, Harry H. Laughlin, and the conservationist Madison Grant (all of whom were well-respected during their time) began to lobby for various solutions to the problem of the \\"unfit.\\" Davenport favored immigration restriction and sterilization as primary methods; Goddard favored segregation in his The Kallikak Family; Grant favored all of the above and more, even entertaining the idea of extermination.Kevles, 1986: pp. 133‚Äì135. By 1910, there was a large and dynamic network of scientists, reformers, and professionals engaged in national eugenics projects and actively promoting eugenic legislation. The American Breeder's Association, the first eugenic body in the U.S., expanded in 1906 to include a specific eugenics committee under the direction of Charles B. Davenport. The ABA was formed specifically to \\"investigate and report on heredity in the human race, and emphasize the value of superior blood and the menace to society of inferior blood.\\" Membership included Alexander Graham Bell, Stanford president David Starr Jordan and Luther Burbank.Stern, 2005: pp. 82‚Äì91, 84,144. The American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality was one of the first organizations to begin investigating infant mortality rates in terms of eugenics.Selden, 2005: p. 206. They promoted government intervention in attempts to promote the health of future citizens. Several feminist reformers advocated an agenda of eugenic legal reform. The National Federation of Women's Clubs, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the National League of Women Voters were among the variety of state and local feminist organization that at some point lobbied for eugenic reforms. One of the most prominent feminists to champion the eugenic agenda was Margaret Sanger, the leader of the American birth control movement and founder of Planned Parenthood. Sanger saw birth control as a means to prevent unwanted children from being born into a disadvantaged life, and incorporated the language of eugenics to advance the movement.\\"The Sanger- Hitler Equation\\", Margaret Sanger Papers Project Newsletter, #32, Winter 2002/3. New York University Department of HistoryCarole Ruth McCann. Birth Control Politics in the United States, 1916‚Äì1945. Cornell University Press. p. 100. Sanger also sought to discourage the reproduction of persons who, it was believed, would pass on mental disease or serious physical defects. In these cases, she approved of the use of sterilization. In Sanger's opinion, it was individual women (if able-bodied) and not the state who should determine whether or not to have a child. U.S. eugenics poster advocating for the removal of genetic \\"defectives\\" such as the insane, \\"feeble-minded\\" and criminals, and supporting the selective breeding of \\"high-grade\\" individuals, c. 1926 In the Deep South, women's associations played an important role in rallying support for eugenic legal reform. Eugenicists recognized the political and social influence of southern clubwomen in their communities, and used them to help implement eugenics across the region. Between 1915 and 1920, federated women's clubs in every state of the Deep South had a critical role in establishing public eugenic institutions that were segregated by sex.Larson, p. 75. For example, the Legislative Committee of the Florida State Federation of Women's Clubs successfully lobbied to institute a eugenic institution for the mentally retarded that was segregated by sex. Their aim was to separate mentally retarded men and women in order to prevent them from breeding more \\"feebleminded\\" individuals. Public acceptance in the U.S. led to various state legislatures working to establish eugenic initiatives. Beginning with Connecticut in 1896, many states enacted marriage laws with eugenic criteria, prohibiting anyone who was \\"epileptic, imbecile or feeble-minded\\" from marrying. The first state to introduce a compulsory sterilization bill was Michigan in 1897 - although the proposed law failed to garner enough votes by legislators to be adopted, it did set the stage for other sterilization bills. Eight years later, Pennsylvania's state legislators passed a sterilization bill that was vetoed by the governor. Indiana became the first state to enact sterilization legislation in 1907,The Indiana Supreme Court overturned the law in 1921 in Williams v. Smith, 131 NE 2 (Ind.), 1921, text at followed closely by Washington, California, and Connecticut in 1909. Sterilization rates across the country were relatively low (California being the sole exception) until the 1927 Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell which legitimized the forced sterilization of patients at a Virginia home for those who were seen as mentally retarded.  Immigration restrictions  In the late 19th century, many scientists, who were concerned about the population leaning too far away from the favored \\"Anglo-Saxon superiority\\" due to a rise in immigration from Europe, partnered with other interest groups to implement immigration laws that could be justified on the basis of genetics. After the 1890 U.S. census, people began to believe that immigrants who were of Nordic or Anglo-Saxon stock were greatly favored over Southern and Eastern Europeans, specifically Jews who were seen by some eugenicists, like Harry Laughlin, to be genetically inferior. During the early 20th century as the United States and Canada began to receive higher numbers of immigrants, influential eugenicists like Lothrop Stoddard and Laughlin (who was appointed as an expert witness for the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization in 1920) presented arguments that these immigrants would pollute the national gene pool if their numbers went unrestricted.Statement of Mr. Harry H. Laughlin, Secretary of the Eugenics Research Association, Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, N. Y.; Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, House of Representatives, Washington D.C., 16 April 1920. In 1921, a temporary measure was passed to slowdown the open door on immigration. The Immigration Restriction League was the first American entity to be closely associated with eugenics and was founded in 1894 by three recent Harvard graduates. The overall goal of the League was to prevent what they perceived as inferior races from diluting \\"the superior American racial stock\\" (those who were of the upper-class Anglo-Saxon heritage), and they began working to have stricter anti-immigration laws in the United States. The League lobbied for a literacy test for immigrants as they attempted to enter the United States, based on the belief that literacy rates were low among \\"inferior races\\". Eugenicists believed that immigrants were often degenerate, had low IQs, and were afflicted with shiftlessness, alcoholism and insubordination. According to Eugenicists, all of these problems were transmitted through genes. Literacy test bills were vetoed by Presidents in 1897, 1913 and 1915; eventually, President Wilson's second veto was overruled by Congress in 1917. With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, eugenicists for the first time played an important role in the Congressional debate as expert advisers on the threat of \\"inferior stock\\" from eastern and southern Europe. The new act, inspired by the eugenic belief in the racial superiority of \\"old stock\\" white Americans as members of the \\"Nordic race\\" (a form of white supremacy), strengthened the position of existing laws prohibiting race-mixing.Lombardo, Paul; \\"Eugenics Laws Restricting Immigration,\\" , Eugenics Archive Whereas Anglo-Saxon and Nordic people were seen as the most desirable immigrants, the Chinese and Japanese were seen as the least desirable and were largely banned from entering the U.S as a result of the immigration act.Gould, Stephen J. (1981) The mismeasure of man. Norton: In addition to the immigration act, eugenic considerations also lay behind the adoption of incest laws in much of the U.S. and were used to justify many anti-miscegenation laws.Lombardo, Paul; \\"Eugenic Laws Against Race-Mixing\\", Eugenics Archive  Efforts to shape American families  Unfit v. fit individuals = Both class and race factored into the eugenic definitions of \\"fit\\" and \\"unfit.\\" By using intelligence testing, American eugenicists asserted that social mobility was indicative of one's genetic fitness. This reaffirmed the existing class and racial hierarchies and explained why the upper-to-middle class was predominantly white. Middle-to-upper class status was a marker of \\"superior strains.\\" In contrast, eugenicists believed poverty to be a characteristic of genetic inferiority, which meant that those deemed \\"unfit\\" were predominantly of the lower classes. Because class status designated some more fit than others, eugenicists treated upper and lower-class women differently. Positive eugenicists, who promoted procreation among the fittest in society, encouraged middle-class women to bear more children. Between 1900 and 1960, eugenicists appealed to middle class white women to become more \\"family minded,\\" and to help better the race. To this end, eugenicists often denied middle and upper- class women sterilization and birth control. However, since poverty was associated with prostitution and \\"mental idiocy,\\" women of the lower classes were the first to be deemed \\"unfit\\" and \\"promiscuous.\\" = Concerns over hereditary genes = In the 19th century, based on a view of Lamarckism, it was believed that the damage done to people by diseases could be inherited and therefore, through eugenics, these diseases could be eradicated. This belief was carried into the 20th century as public health measures were taken to improve health with the hope that such measures would result in better health of future generations. A 1911 Carnegie Institute report explored eighteen methods for removing defective genetic attributes; the eighth method was euthanasia. Though the most commonly suggested method of euthanasia was to set up local gas chambers, many in the eugenics movement did not believe that Americans were ready to implement a large-scale euthanasia program, so many doctors came up with alternative ways of subtly implementing eugenic euthanasia in various medical institutions. For example, a mental institution in Lincoln, Illinois fed its incoming patients milk infected with tuberculosis (reasoning that genetically fit individuals would be resistant), resulting in 30‚Äì40% annual death rates. Other doctors practiced euthanasia through various forms of lethal neglect. In the 1930s, there was a wave of portrayals of eugenic \\"mercy killings\\" in American film, newspapers, and magazines. In 1931, the Illinois Homeopathic Medicine Association began lobbying for the right to euthanize \\"imbeciles\\" and other defectives. A few years later, in 1938, the Euthanasia Society of America was founded.Pernick, 2009: p. 161. However, despite this, euthanasia saw marginal support in the U.S., motivating people to turn to forced segregation and sterilization programs as a means for keeping the \\"unfit\\" from reproducing. = Better Baby Contests = Mary deGormo, a former teacher, was the first person to combine ideas about health and intelligence standards with competitions at state fairs, in the form of baby contests. She developed the first such contest, the \\"Scientific Baby Contest\\" for the Louisiana State Fair in Shreveport, in 1908. She saw these contests as a contribution to the \\"social efficiency\\" movement, which was advocating for the standardization of all aspects of American life as a means of increasing efficiency. DeGarmo was assisted by Doctor Jacob Bodenheimer, a pediatrician who helped her develop grading sheets for contestants, which combined physical measurements with standardized measurements of intelligence.Selden 2005: p. 207. Contestants preparing for the Better Baby Contest at the 1931 Indiana State Fair. The contest spread to other U.S. states in the early twentieth century. In Indiana, for example, Ada Estelle Schweitzer, a eugenics advocate and director of the Indiana State Board of Health's Division of Child and Infant Hygiene, organized and supervised the state's Better Baby contests at the Indiana State Fair from 1920 to 1932. It was among the fair's most popular events. During the contest's first year at the fair, a total of 78 babies were examined; in 1925 the total reached 885. Contestants peaked at 1,301 infants in 1930, and the following year the number of entrants was capped at 1,200. Although the specific impact of the contests was difficult to assess, statistics helped to support Schweitzer's claims that the contests helped reduce infant mortality. The intent of the contest was to educate the public about raising healthier children as during the time period, it was approximated that 100 infants out of every 1000 births passed away prior to their first birthday. However, its exclusionary practices reinforced social class and racial discrimination. In Indiana, for example, the contestants were limited to white infants; African American and immigrant children were barred from the competition for ribbons and cash prizes. In addition, the scoring was biased toward white, middle-class babies.Stern, \\"Making Better Babies, \\" pp. 742, 746‚Äì50. The contest procedure included recording each child's health history, as well as evaluations of each contestant's physical and mental health and overall development using medical professionals. Using a process similar to the one introduced at the Louisiana State Fair, and contest guidelines that the AMA and U.S. Children's Bureau recommended, scoring for each contestant began with 1,000 points. Deductions were made for defects, including a child's measurements below a designated average. The contestant with the most points was declared the winner.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., \\"Indiana's 200,\\" pp. 299‚Äì300. Standardization through scientific judgment was a topic that was very serious in the eyes of the scientific community, but has often been downplayed as just a popular fad or trend. Nevertheless, a lot of time, effort, and money was put into these contests and their scientific backing, which would influence cultural ideas as well as local and state government practices. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People promoted eugenics by hosting \\"Better Baby\\" contests and the proceeds would go to its anti-lynching campaign. = Fitter Families = First appearing in 1920 at the Kansas Free Fair, \\"Fitter Families for Future Firesides\\" competitions continued all the way up to World War II. Mary T. Watts and Dr. Florence Brown Sherbon,\\"A social register of fitter families and better babies\\" The Milwaukee Sentinel . 26 May 1929\\"Fitter family contests\\" eugenics archive.ca both initiators of the Better Baby Contests in Iowa, took the idea of positive eugenics for babies and combined it with a determinist concept of biology to come up with fitter family competitions.\\"Fitter Family Contests.\\" Eugenics Archive. Web. 2 March 2010. . There were several different categories that families were judged in: size of the family, overall attractiveness, and health of the family, all of which helped to determine the likelihood of having healthy children. These competitions were simply a continuation of the Better Baby contests that promoted certain physical and mental qualities.Boudreau 2005: At the time, it was believed that certain behavioral qualities were inherited from one's parents. This led to the addition of several judging categories including: generosity, self-sacrificing, and quality of familial bonds. Additionally, there were negative features that were judged: selfishness, jealousy, suspiciousness, high-temperedness, and cruelty. Feeblemindedness, alcoholism, and paralysis were few among other traits that were included as physical traits to be judged when looking at family lineage.Selden, 2005: Doctors and specialists from the community would offer their time to judge these competitions, which were originally sponsored by the Red Cross. The winners of these competitions were given a Bronze Medal as well as champion cups called \\"Capper Medals.\\" The cups were named after then-Governor and Senator, Arthur Capper and he would present them to \\"Grade A individuals\\".Selden, 2005: p. 211. The perks of entering into the contests were that the competitions provided a way for families to get a free health check-up by a doctor as well as some of the pride and prestige that came from winning the competitions. By 1925 the Eugenics Records Office was distributing standardized forms for judging eugenically fit families, which were used in contests in several U.S. states.  Compulsory sterilization  In 1907, Indiana passed the first eugenics-based compulsory sterilization law in the world. Thirty U.S. states would soon follow their lead.Lombardo, 2011: p. ix.Indiana Supreme Court Legal History Lecture Series, \\"Three Generations of Imbeciles are Enough:\\"Reflections on 100 Years of Eugenics in Indiana, at In.gov Although the law was overturned by the Indiana Supreme Court in 1921,Williams v. Smith, 131 NE 2 (Ind.), 1921, text at in the 1927 case Buck v. Bell, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924, allowing for the compulsory sterilization of patients of state mental institutions. Citing Buck v. Bell 274 U.S. 200, 205 (1927) The number of sterilizations performed per year increased until another Supreme Court case, Skinner v. Oklahoma, 1942, which ruled that under the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, laws that permitted the compulsory sterilization of criminals were unconstitutional if these laws treated similar crimes differently. Although Skinner determined that the right to procreate was a fundamental right under the constitution, the case did not denounce sterilization laws as the analysis was based on the equal protection of criminal defendants specifically, therefore leaving those seen as 'social undesirables'--the poor, the disabled, and various ethnic groups‚Äîas targets of compulsory sterilization. Therefore, though compulsory sterilization is now considered an abuse of human rights, Buck v. Bell has never been overturned, and Virginia specifically did not repeal its sterilization law until 1974. Men and women were compulsorily sterilized for different reasons. Men were sterilized to treat their aggression and to eliminate their criminal behavior, while women were sterilized to control the results of their sexuality. Since women bore children, eugenicists held women more accountable than men for the reproduction of the less \\"desirable\\" members of society. Eugenicists therefore predominantly targeted women in their efforts to regulate the birth rate, to \\"protect\\" white racial health, and weed out the \\"defectives\\" of society. The most significant era of eugenic sterilization was between 1907 and 1963, when over 64,000 individuals were forcibly sterilized under eugenic legislation in the United States.Lombardo, Paul; \\"Eugenic Sterilization Laws\\", Eugenics Archive Beginning around 1930, there was a steady increase in the percentage of women sterilized, and in a few states only young women were sterilized. A 1937 Fortune magazine poll found that 2/3 of respondents supported eugenic sterilization of \\"mental defectives\\", 63% supported sterilization of criminals, and only 15% opposed both.Oklahoma City January 2 \\"sterilization of habitual criminals\\". The Montreal Gazette. January 3, 1934 From 1930 to the 1960s, sterilizations were performed on many more institutionalized women than men. By 1961, 61 percent of the 62,162 total eugenic sterilizations in the United States were performed on women. A favorable report on the results of sterilization in California, the state that conducted the most sterilizations (20,000 of the 60,000 that occurred between 1909 and 1960), was published in book form by the biologist Paul Popenoe and was widely cited by the Nazi government as evidence that wide-reaching sterilization programs were feasible and humane. After World War II, eugenics and eugenic organizations began to revise their standards of reproductive fitness to reflect contemporary social concerns of the later half of the 20th century, notably concerns over welfare, Mexican immigration, overpopulation, civil rights, and sexual revolution, and gave way to what has been termed neo-eugenics. Neo-eugenicists like Dr. Clarence Gamble, an affluent researcher at Harvard Medical school and a founder of public birth control clinics, revived the eugenics movement in the United States through sterilization. Supporters of this revival of eugenic sterilizations believed that they would bring an end to social issues such as poverty and mental illness while also saving taxpayer money and boost the economy. Whereas eugenic sterilization programs before WWII were mostly conducted on prisoners or patients in mental hospitals, after the war, compulsory sterilizations were targeted at poor people and minorities. As a result of these new sterilization initiatives, though most scholars agree that there were over 64,000 known cases of eugenic sterilization in the U.S. by 1963, no one knows for certain how many compulsory sterilizations occurred between the late 1960s to 1970s, though it is estimated that at least 80,000 may have been conducted. A large number of those who were targets of coerced sterilizations in the later half of the century were African American, Hispanic, and Native American Women.  Eugenics, sterilization, and the African American community  African American support for eugenics and birth control (late 19th to early 20th centuries) = Early proponents of the eugenics movement did not only include influential white Americans but also several proponent African American intellectuals such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Thomas Wyatt Turner, and many academics at Tuskegee University, Howard University, and Hampton University. However, unlike many white eugenicists, these black intellectuals believed the best African Americans were as good as the best White Americans, and \\"The Talented Tenth\\" of all races should mix. Indeed, Du Bois believed \\"only fit blacks should procreate to eradicate the race's heritage of moral iniquity.\\"Dorr, Gregory; Logan, Angela (2011). \\"Quality, not mere quantity counts: black eugenics and the NAACP baby contests\\". In Lombardo, Paul (ed.). A Century of Eugenics in America: From the Indiana Experiment to the Human Genome Era. Indiana University Press. pp. 68‚Äì92. . With the support of leaders like Du Bois, efforts were made in the early 20th century to control the reproduction of the country's black population; one of the most visible initiatives was Margaret Sanger's 1939 proposal, The Negro Project. That year, Sanger, Florence Rose, her assistant, and Mary Woodward Reinhardt, then secretary of the new Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA), drafted a report on \\"Birth Control and the Negro.\\" In this report, they stated that African Americans were the group with \\"the greatest economic, health and social problems,\\" were largely illiterate and \\"still breed carelessly and disastrously,\\" a line taken from W.E.B. DuBois' article in the June 1932 Birth Control Review. The Project often sought after prominent African American leaders to spread knowledge regarding birth control and the perceived positive effects it would have on the African American community, such as poverty and the lack of education.\\"Opposition Claims About Margaret Sanger\\" (PDF). Planned Parenthood. Katherine Dexter McCormick Library. 2004. Archived (PDF) from the original on 8 March 2017. Retrieved 8 March 2017. Sanger particularly sought out black ministers from the South to serve as leaders in the Project in the hopes of countering any ideas that the project was a strategic attempt to eradicate the black population. However, despite Sanger's best efforts, white medical scientists took control over the initiative, and with the Negro Project receiving praise from white leaders and eugenicists, many of Sanger's opponents, both during the creation of the Project and years after, saw her work as an attempt to terminate African Americans. = Eugenics during the civil rights era = Opposition to initiatives to control reproduction within the African American community grew in the 1960s, particularly after President Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1965, announced the establishment of federal funding of birth control used on the poor. In the 1960, many African Americans throughout the country took the government's decision to fund birth control clinics as an attempt to limit the growth of the black population and along with it, the increase political power that black Americans were fighting to acquire. Scholars have stated that African Americans' fear about their reproductive health and ability was rooted in history as under U.S. slavery, enslaved women were often coerced or forced to have children to increase a plantation owner's wealth. Therefore, many African Americans, particularly those in the Black Power Movement, saw birth control, and federal support of the Pill, as equivalent to black genocide, declaring it as such at the 1967 Black Power Conference. Federal funding for birth control went alongside family planning initiatives that were a part of state welfare programs. These initiatives, in addition to advocating the use of the Pill, supported sterilization as a means of curbing the number of people receiving welfare and control the reproduction of 'unfit' women. The 1950s and 1960s were the height of the sterilization abuse that African American women as a group experienced at the hands of the white medical establishment. During this period, the sterilization of African American women largely took place in the South and assumed two forms: the sterilization of poor unwed black mothers, and \\"Mississippi appendectomies.\\" Under these \\"Mississippi appendectomies,\\" women who went to the hospital to give birth, or for some other medical treatment, often found themselves incapable of having more children upon leaving the hospital due to unnecessary hysterectomies performed on them by southern medical students. By the 1970s, the coerced sterilization of women of color spread from the South to the rest of the country through federal family planning and under the guise of voluntary contraceptive surgery as physicians began to require their patients to sign consent forms to surgeries they did not want or understand. = Sterilization of African American women = Though it is unknown the exact number of African American women who were sterilized throughout the country in the 20th century, records from a few states offer some estimates. In the state of North Carolina, which was seen as having the most aggressive eugenics program out of the 32 states that had one, during the 45-year reign of the North Carolina Eugenics Board, from 1929 to 1974, a disproportionate number of those who were targeted for forced or coerced sterilization were black and female, with almost all being poor. Of the 7,600 women who were sterilized by the state between the years of 1933 and 1973, about 5,000 were African American. In light of this history, North Carolina became the first state to offer compensation to surviving victims of compulsory sterilization. Additionally, whereas African Americans made up just over 1% of California's population, they accounted for at least 4% of the total number of sterilization operations conducted by the state between 1909 and 1979. Overall, according to one 1989 study, 31.6% of African American women without a high school diploma were sterilized while only 14.5% of white women of the same educational status were sterilized. = Sterilization abuse brought to media attention = In 1972, United States Senate committee testimony brought to light that at least 2,000 involuntary sterilizations had been performed on poor black women without their consent or knowledge. An investigation revealed that the surgeries were all performed in the South, and were all performed on black women with multiple children who were receiving welfare. Testimony revealed that many of these women were threatened with an end to their welfare benefits unless they consented to sterilization. These surgeries were instances of sterilization abuse, a term applied to any sterilization performed without the consent or knowledge of the recipient, or in which the recipient is pressured into accepting the surgery. Because the funds used to carry out the surgeries came from the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity, the sterilization abuse raised suspicions, especially among members of the black community, that \\"federal programs were underwriting eugenicists who wanted to impose their views about population quality on minorities and poor women.\\" Despite this investigation, it was not until 1973 that the issue of sterilization abuse was brought to media attention. On June 14, 1973, two black girls, Minnie Lee and Mary Alice Relf, ages fourteen and twelve, respectively, were sterilized without their knowledge in Alabama by the Montgomery Community Action Committee, an OEO- financed organization. The summer of that year, the Relf girls sued the government agencies and individuals responsible for their sterilization. As the case was being pursued, it was discovered that the girls' mother, who could not read, unwittingly approved the operations, signing an 'X' on the release forms; Mrs. Relf had believed that she was signing a form authorizing her daughters to receive Depo-Provera injections, a form of birth control. In light of the 1974 case of Relf v. Weinberger, named after Minnie Lee and Mary Alice's older sister, Katie, who had narrowly escaped also being sterilized, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) were ordered to establish new guidelines for its government sterilization policy. By 1979, the new guidelines finally addressed the concern over informed consent, determined that minors under the age of 21 and those with severe mentally impairments who could not give consent would not be sterilized, and articulated the provision that doctors could no longer claim that a woman's refusal to be sterilized would result in her being denied welfare benefits.  Sterilization of Latina women  The 20th century demarcated a time in which compulsory sterilization heavily navigated its way into primarily Latinx communities, against Latina women. Locations such as Puerto Rico and Los Angeles, California were found to have had large amounts of their female population coerced into sterilization procedures without quality and necessary informed consent nor full awareness of the procedure. = Puerto Rico = Between the span of the 1930s to the 1970s, nearly one-third of the female population in Puerto Rico was sterilized; at the time, this was the highest rate of sterilization in the world. Arguments stand that the implementation of sterilization was in an effort to rectify the country's poverty and unemployment rates, even so that sterilization became legal in the eyes of the government in 1937. The procedure was so common that it was often referred to solely as ‚Äúla operaci√≥n\\", garnering a documentary referenced by the same name. This intentional targeting of Latinx communities exemplifies the strategic placement of racial eugenics in modern history. This targeting is also inclusive of those with disabilities and those from marginalized populations, which Puerto Rico is not the only example of this trend. Eugenics did not serve as the only reason for the disproportionate rates of sterilization in the Puerto Rican community. Contraceptive trials were inducted in the 1950s towards Puerto Rican women. Dr. John Rock and Dr. Gregory Pincus were the two men spearheading the human trials of oral contraceptives. In 1954, the decision was made to conduct the clinical experiment in Puerto Rico, citing the island's large network of birth control clinics and lack of anti-birth control laws, which was in contrast to the United States' thorough cultural and religious opposition to the reproductive service. The decision to conduct the trials in this community was also motivated by the structural implications of supremacy and colonialism. Rock and Pincus monopolized off of the primarily poor and uneducated background of these women, countering that if they \\"could follow the Pill regimen, then women anywhere in the world could too.\\" These women were purposely ill-informed of the oral contraceptives presence; the researchers only reported that the drug, which was administered at a much higher dosage than what birth control is prescribed at today, was to prevent pregnancy, not that it was tied to a clinical trial in order to jump start oral contraceptive access in America through FDA approval. = California = In California, by the year 1964, a total of 20,108 people were sterilized, making that the largest amount in all of the United States. It is an important note that during this period in California's population demographic, the total individuals sterilized was disproportionately inclusive of Mexican, Mexican-American, and Chicana women. Andrea Estrada, a UC Santa Barbara affiliate, said: > Beginning in 1909 and continuing for 70 years, California led the country in > the number of sterilization procedures performed on men and women, often > without their full knowledge and consent. Approximately 20,000 > sterilizations took place in state institutions, comprising one-third of the > total number performed in the 32 states where such action was legal. Cases such as Madrigal v. Quilligan, a class action suit regarding forced or coerced postpartum sterilization of Latina women following cesarean sections, helped bring to light the widespread abuse of sterilization supported by federal funds. The case's plaintiffs were 10 sterilized women of Los Angeles County Hospital who elected to come forward with their stories. Although a grim reality, No m√°s beb√©s is a documentary that offers an emotional and candid storytelling of the Madrigal v. Quilligan case on behalf of Latina women whom were direct recipients of the coerced sterilization of the Los Angeles' hospital. The judge's ruling sided with the County Hospital, but an aftermath of the case resulted in the accessibility of multiple language informed consent forms. These stories, among many others, serve as backbones for not only the reproductive justice movement that we see today, but a better understanding and recognition of the Chicana feminism movement in contrast to white feminism's perception of reproductive rights.  Sterilization of Native American women  An estimated 40% of Native American women (60,000-70,000 women) and 10% of Native American men in the United States underwent sterilization in the 1970s. A General Accounting Office (GAO) report in 1976 found that 3,406 Native American women, 3,000 of which were of childbearing age, were sterilized by the Indian Health Service (IHS) in Arizona, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and South Dakota from 1973 to 1976. The GAO report did not conclude any instances of coerced sterilization, but called for the reform of IHS and contract doctors' processes of obtaining informed consent for sterilization procedures. The IHS informed consent processes examined by the GAO did not comply with a 1974 ruling of the U.S. District Court that \\"any individual contemplating sterilization should be advised orally at the outset that at no time could federal benefits be withdrawn because of failure to agree to sterilization.\\" In examining individual cases and testimonies of Native American women, scholars have found that IHS and contract physicians recommended sterilization to Native American women as the appropriate form of birth control, failing to present potential alternatives and to explain the irreversible nature of sterilization, and threatened that refusal of the procedure would result in the women losing their children and/or federal benefits. Scholars also identified language barriers in informed consent processes as the absence of interpreters for Native American women hindered them from fully understanding the sterilization procedure and its implications, in some cases. Scholars have cited physicians' individual paternalism and beliefs about the population control of poor communities and welfare recipients and the opportunity for financial gain as possible motivations for performing sterilizations on Native American women. Native American women and activists mobilized in the 1970s across the United States to combat the coerced sterilization of Native American women and advocate for their reproductive rights, alongside tribal sovereignty, in the Red Power movement. Some of the most prominent activist organizations established in this decade and active in the Red Power movement and the resistance against coerced sterilization were the American Indian Movement (AIM), United Native Americans, Women of all Red Nations (WARN), the International Indian Treaty Council (IITC), and Indian Women United for Justice, founded by Dr. Constance Redbird Pinkerton Uri, a Cherokee-Choctaw physician. Some Native American activists have deemed the coerced sterilization of Native American women a \\"modern form of genocide,\\" and view these sterilizations as a violation of the rights of tribes as sovereign nations. Others argue that the sterilization of Native American women is interconnected with colonialist and capitalist motives of corporations and the federal government to acquire land and natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and coal, currently located on Native American reservations. Scholars and Native American activists have situated the forced sterilizations of Native American women within broader histories of colonialism, violations of Native American tribal sovereignty by the federal government, including a long history of the removal of children from Native American women and families, and population control efforts in the United States. The 1970s brought new federal legislation enacted by the United States government which addressed issues of informed consent, sterilization, and the treatment of Native American children. The U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare released new regulations in 1979 on informed consent processes for sterilization procedures, including a longer waiting period of 30 days before the procedure, the presentation of alternative methods of birth control to the patient, and clear verbal affirmation that the patient's access to federal benefits or welfare programs would not be revoked if the procedure were refused. The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 officially recognized the significance and value of the extended family in Native American culture, adopting \\"minimum federal standards for the removal of Indian children to foster or adoptive homes,\\" and the central importance of the sovereign tribal governments in decision-making processes surrounding the welfare of Native children.  Influence on Nazi Germany  After the eugenics movement was well established in the United States, it spread to Germany. California eugenicists began producing literature promoting eugenics and sterilization and sending it overseas to German scientists and medical professionals. By 1933, California had subjected more people to forceful sterilization than all other U.S. states combined. The forced sterilization program engineered by the Nazis was partly inspired by California's. The Rockefeller Foundation helped develop and fund various German eugenics programs, including the one that Josef Mengele worked in before he went to Auschwitz. Upon returning from Germany in 1934, where more than 5,000 people per month were being forcibly sterilized, the California eugenics leader C. M. Goethe bragged to a colleague:Eugenics researcher Harry H. Laughlin often bragged that his Model Eugenic Sterilization laws had been implemented in the 1935 Nuremberg racial hygiene laws. In 1936, Laughlin was invited to an award ceremony at Heidelberg University in Germany (scheduled on the anniversary of Hitler's 1934 purge of Jews from the Heidelberg faculty), to receive an honorary doctorate for his work on the \\"science of racial cleansing\\". Due to financial limitations, Laughlin was unable to attend the ceremony and had to pick it up from the Rockefeller Institute. Afterward, he proudly shared the award with his colleagues, remarking that he felt that it symbolized the \\"common understanding of German and American scientists of the nature of eugenics.\\"Lombardo, 2008: pp. 211‚Äì213. Henry Friedlander wrote that although the German and American eugenics movements were similar, the U.S. did not follow the same slippery slope as Nazi eugenics because American \\"federalism and political heterogeneity encouraged diversity even with a single movement.\\" In contrast, the German eugenics movement was more centralized and had fewer diverse ideas. Unlike the American movement, one publication and one society, the German Society for Racial Hygiene, represented all German eugenicists in the early 20th century. After 1945, however, historians began to try to portray the U.S. eugenics movement as distinct and distant from Nazi eugenics.K√ºhl 2001: p. xiv. Jon Entine wrote that eugenics simply means \\"good genes\\" and using it as synonym for genocide is an \\"all-too-common distortion of the social history of genetics policy in the United States.\\" According to Entine, eugenics developed out of the Progressive Era and not \\"Hitler's twisted Final Solution.\\"Let's (Cautiously) Celebrate the \\"New Eugenics\\", Huffington Post, (30 October 2014).  Eugenics after World War II  Genetic engineering = After Hitler's advanced idea of eugenics, the movement lost its place in society for a bit of time. Although eugenics was not thought about much, aspects like sterilization were still taking place, just not at such a public level. As technology developed, the field of genetic engineering emerged. Instead of sterilizing people to ultimately get rid of \\"undesirable\\" people, genetic engineering \\"changes or removes genes to prevent disease or improve the body in some significant way.\\" Proponents of genetic engineering cite its ability to cure and prevent life-threatening diseases. Genetic engineering began in the 1970s when scientists began to clone and alter genes. From this, scientists were able to create life-saving health interventions such as human insulin, the first-ever genetically-engineered drug. Because of this development, over the years scientists were able to create new drugs to treat devastating diseases. For example, in the early 1990s, a group of scientists were able to use a gene-drug to treat severe combined immunodeficiency in a young girl. However, genetic engineering also further allows for the practice of eliminating \\"undesirable traits\\" within humans and other organisms - for example, with current genetic tests, parents are able to test a fetus for any life-threatening diseases that may impact the child's life and then choose to abort the baby. Some fear that this will could lead to ethnic cleansing, or alternative form of eugenics. The ethical implications of genetic engineering were heavily considered by scientists at the time, and the Asilomar Conference was held in 1975 to discuss these concerns and set reasonable, voluntary guidelines that researchers would follow while using DNA technologies.  Compulsory sterilization prevention and continuation  The 1978 Federal Sterilization Regulations, created by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare or HEW, (now the United States Department of Health and Human Services) outline a variety of prohibited sterilization practices that were often used previously to coerce or force women into sterilization.US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. 42 Code of Federal Regulations. 441.250‚Äì259 (1978). These were intended to prevent such eugenics and neo-eugenics as resulted in the involuntary sterilization of large groups of poor and minority women. Such practices include: not conveying to patients that sterilization is permanent and irreversible, in their own language (including the option to end the process or procedure at any time without conceding any future medical attention or federal benefits, the ability to ask any and all questions about the procedure and its ramifications, the requirement that the consent seeker describes the procedure fully including any and all possible discomforts and/or side-effects and any and all benefits of sterilization); failing to provide alternative information about methods of contraception, family planning, or pregnancy termination that are nonpermanent and/or irreversible (this includes abortion); conditioning receiving welfare and/or Medicaid benefits by the individual or his/her children on the individuals \\"consenting\\" to permanent sterilization; tying elected abortion to compulsory sterilization (cannot receive a sought out abortion without \\"consenting\\" to sterilization); using hysterectomy as sterilization; and subjecting minors and the mentally incompetent to sterilization. The regulations also include an extension of the informed consent waiting period from 72 hours to 30 days (with a maximum of 180 days between informed consent and the sterilization procedure). However, several studies have indicated that the forms are often dense and complex and beyond the literacy aptitude of the average American, and those seeking publicly funded sterilization are more likely to possess below-average literacy skills. High levels of misinformation concerning sterilization still exist among individuals who have already undergone sterilization procedures, with permanence being one of the most common gray factors. Additionally, federal enforcement of the requirements of the 1978 Federal Sterilization Regulation is inconsistent and some of the prohibited abuses continue to be pervasive, particularly in underfunded hospitals and lower income patient hospitals and care centers. The compulsory sterilization of American men and women continues to this day. In 2013, it was reported that 148 female prisoners in two California prisons were sterilized between 2006 and 2010 in a supposedly voluntary program, but it was determined that the prisoners did not give consent to the procedures.\\"Sterilization Abuse in State Prisons\\" News 07/23/2013 author Alex Stern In September 2014, California enacted Bill SB1135 that bans sterilization in correctional facilities, unless the procedure is required to save an inmate's life.

He was stationed in Tirano and was in charge of the internment camp in Aprica. On September 12, Pope Pius XII sent Giuseppe Carozzi, a young Italian priest with a secret request. The Pope wanted Marinelli to liberate 300 Yugoslavian Jews from the internment camp and give them safe passage into Switzerland. Marinelli went against strict Nazi orders forbidding Jews, prisoners of war, or anyone who had not joined Benito Mussolini's northern Italian Republic of Salo from crossing the border, and that same night let them escape from the camp. Leonardo's diary states that he even ordered guards to help carry the belongings of the Jews. After four days of travelling through unbeaten paths, the prisoners, being primarily led by Carozzi and another priest, Cirillo Vitalini, along with the help of Marinelli safely managed to cross into Switzerland. Escape to Switzerland Following the escape of the Jewish prisoners, the Nazis, which had not yet mobilized in that region, began sending more and more troops in an effort to stop illegal border crossings. They also put into effect a decree which proclaimed that anyone helping the Jews would be put to death. A captain from the SS confronted Marinelli, asking for collaboration and information. Marinelli agreed to his requests and the SS captain left. Marinelli, seeing the upcoming danger decided it was best to leave. On the 22 of September, of that same year, Marinelli, along with his family, fled to Switzerland. He remained in a refugee camp until 4 July 1945.

In this model, the strain energy density function is designed such that it has a singularity when the first invariant of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor reaches a limiting value I_m. The strain energy density function for the Gent model is Gent, A.N., 1996, A new constitutive relation for rubber, Rubber Chemistry Tech., 69, pp. 59-61. : W = -\\\\cfrac{\\\\mu J_m}{2} \\\\ln\\\\left(1 - \\\\cfrac{I_1-3}{J_m}\\\\right) where \\\\mu is the shear modulus and J_m = I_m -3.

While he takes inspiration from the quality of light in the paintings of Vermeer and Rembrandt, his themes lie more within the realms of surrealism and visionary art than traditional painting.Amanda Erlanson, \\"Chris Berens Is The Only Living Boy In New York,\\" Erratic Phenomena, 12/11/09 Although his work is completely hand-painted, his paintings are often assumed to be digital photographic manipulation.Kirsten Anderson, \\"The Art of Chris Berens,\\" Hi- Fructose, Vol. 9, 2008 He lives in Amsterdam with his wife Esther and their daughters Emma & Juno Leeuwenhart. Life Chris Berens was born in 1976 in Oss, Netherlands, near the historic town of 's-Hertogenbosch, the birthplace of Hieronymous Bosch, a factor that would feature in his artistic development. When he was a boy, his father brought him to many exhibitions of the Dutch Golden Age painters, including Frans Hals, Rembrandt and Vermeer, and those images became infused into the internal world he began imagining as a child. He studied illustration at the AKV St. Joost in Den Bosch, graduating in 1999. While working as a freelance illustrator, Berens began to teach himself to paint in several dilapidated buildings in the rural area near his childhood home.Ruud Lapr√© and Chris Berens, 2239, Jaski Gallery, 2008 Attempting to emulate the painting methods of the Old Masters and 19th-century academic artists like Ingres and Bouguereau, he learned by copying their work, and eventually came upon a technique which allowed him to achieve an otherworldly dreamlike impression of the qualities he admired in his predecessors. More recently, Berens relocated to Amsterdam, where he began exhibiting his work in 2004.Amanda Erlanson, \\"Chris Berens' Luminous Visions,\\" Erratic Phenomena, 8/31/08 After four sold-out shows at Amsterdam's Jaski Gallery, Berens made the move to infiltrate the American art market in 2008, at Seattle's well- known pop surrealism gallery, Roq la Rue. That sold-out show was his first exposure to American collectors, and the sudden appearance of an artist exhibiting his technical sophistication and evocative dreamlike motifs caused a sensation in pop surrealism circles.\\"Preview: Chris Berens at Roq la Rue,\\" Arrested Motion, 12/1/08 In 2009, he had his first museum retrospective, in which 13 of his paintings were exhibited at the Noordbrabants Museum in Den Bosch. In 2010, Berens was commissioned to create the cover for Blondie's album Panic of Girls.\\"Chris Berens' Panic of Girls Cover,\\" Blondie Official Website Photo Blog, 4/10 He also supplied the artwork for German singer Xavier Naidoo's 2009 album Alles kann besser werden,\\"Xavier Naidoo: Alles Kann Besser Werden,\\" Discoogle.com, 10/23/09 which features a painting called \\"The Big Blue.\\" Work In his work, Berens represents an imaginary world he has been seeing since he was a child. \\"As a boy, I was pretty much what I am now ‚Äì a dreamer... I always had this really special feeling over me... It's a feeling of another place, a warm place, deep inside me, and I fill that place with all that I see and hear.\\" This internal universe is painted as if it is being viewed through a distorted lens, which gives the viewer a sense of peering into a secret world, inhabited by mysterious human figures from another age and a menagerie of real and fanciful animals. He told an interviewer, \\"I simply try to paint the world inside my head. This world has been with me since I was a child. It is populated by people and animals and is filled with landscapes, villages, cities and scenes. All kinds of things happen in this world and various stories unfold. But it's not the ‚Äònormal‚Äô world, and they are not the things that happen in the regular world.\\" Although his 2009 exhibition, \\"The Only Living Boy In New York,\\" was inspired by the impending birth of his first child,J.L. Schnabel, \\"Chris Berens at Sloan Fine Art,\\" Fecal Face, 1/14/10 his most frequently revisited theme is death. In paintings like \\"In Paradisum,\\" \\"Circle of Friends,\\" \\"On a Midnight Voyage\\" and \\"First Snow, Guide Me Home,\\" he had explored various facets of the experience of dying, as he believes that there is \\"a great deal of beauty present in the moment of death. After witnessing the pain and struggle of dying, you also experience the lightness of acceptance and letting go.\\" While he feels he is not yet capable of depicting what he envisions to its full potential, he says he strives to improve his skills rapidly, because he is driven to bring these visions into reality. \\"The reason I paint, is because for me, for now, this is the way to get closest to what I actually see. I suppose you could call it my soul, or the center of me, or my essence.\\" In reference to his most recent exhibition, his Seattle gallerist stated, \\"This new series of works, entitled \\"Leeuwenhart\\" (\\"Lion Heart\\") takes a turn from his last body of work, which depicted icicle-like skyscrapers and New York cityscapes that sparkled like diamonds, to more of a lush, fairytale world of forests, rolling green hills, and ancient looking villages. And while the usual assortment of magical animal spirits show up in all the works, another character makes an appearance, Chris' newborn daughter Emma Leeuwenhart Berens.\\"Kirsten Anderson, \\"Leeuwenhart\\" Press Release, 10/1/10 On occasion, Berens openly references the work of past masters like Ingres, Bouguereau, and Delaroche, because his youthful immersion in their work introduced their subjects, environments and atmosphere into his visionary universe. While these homage paintings often borrow specific elements such as costume and composition, they invariably lift their subjects into a surreal narrative that could never have been conceived by their original creators. Berens explained, \\"Bouguereau, Ingres, Vermeer and others, I've known by heart ever since I was a little boy... I know them. I'm safe with them. Sometimes I miss them as you can suddenly miss your childhood. So I recreate them, for comfort.\\" Technique Berens is notable for his unique and startlingly photorealistic painting methods, which he developed after teaching himself to paint with oils, in an attempt to emulate Old Master techniques. Although he was dissatisfied with the results he was getting with oil, he discovered that drawing inks, which remain fluid and mutable for up to two days, had a similar flexibility to oil paint. He explained, \\"When painting in oil, there are a lot of 'presents' you get from the medium. The way colors mix. The way the paint behaves, from your brush onto your canvas, how fast it dries, what happens if you force-dry it, etc. And oil is the medium that is closest to what I use. The amount of possible interference is at a maximum.\\" When combined with a recent invention, plastic-coated inkjet printing paper, these fluid inks offered a new opportunity that had not been available to earlier generations of painters ‚Äì an utterly smooth, semi-transparent surface designed specifically for the absorption of ink. He said, \\"I use plastic because it has no texture. I use the plastic on printing paper because it is extremely thin, and clever people have scratched their heads over how to keep the ink put.\\" Beginning with pencil sketches and then moving into inks, Berens paints many multiple versions of a figure on inkjet paper. Because the ink remains wet, he is able to work with it for some time ‚Äì for example, dragging through it with a knife to create fur effects, or using a blow dryer to blur areas into soft focus. After a large number of small drawings have been completed, he chooses the portions of the figures he is satisfied with and cuts the paper into pieces, retaining the successful sections of the drawings. Peeling the paper backing off the inkjet paper, he is left with fragments of clear plastic bearing semi-transparent ink paintings. These fragments are then collaged onto board with bookbinder's glue, often six or seven layers deep, which creates an illusion of depth. He says, \\"I use the transparent layers because some things ‚Äì such as skin, fur and light ‚Äì can not be done in one layer (by me, that is). It's the same as real skin ‚Äì the color and texture you see comes from all those semi-transparent layers of tones, and bumps and holes, that your mind blends into 'skin.'\\" Once he is satisfied with the composition, he marries the disparate elements together with ink and varnish, creating a layered assemblage which often includes hundreds of different elements. In 2011, to demonstrate this unusual technique, the artist recorded a time lapse video of the creation of his painting \\"Zadok the Deer.\\" Major Exhibitions *2015 \\"2015\\", Jaski Art Gallery, Amsterdam, Netherlands *2015 \\"Nethermoor\\", Roq la Rue, Seattle, WA, USA * 2014 \\"NENSHA,\\" Japan Museum SieboldHuis, Leiden, Netherlands * 2013 \\"NENSHA,\\" Megumi Ogita Gallery, Tokyo, Japan * 2010 \\"Leeuwenhart,\\" Roq La Rue, Seattle, WA, USA * 2009 \\"The Only Living Boy In New York,\\" Sloan Fine Art, New York, NY * 2009 \\"Chris Berens: Paintings,\\" Noordbrabants Museum, 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands * 2009 \\"White Ones,\\" Jaski Gallery, Amsterdam, Netherlands * 2008 \\"Go West,\\" Roq La Rue, Seattle, WA * 2008 \\"Delicate,\\" Jaski Gallery, Amsterdam, Netherlands * 2007 \\"The Heaven Show,\\" Jaski Gallery, Amsterdam, Netherlands * 2006 \\"Zilver,\\" Jaski Gallery, Amsterdam, Netherlands Publications * \\"Mapping Infinity\\" (2011) * \\"Ninety-Nine\\" (2008) * \\"2239\\" (2008) * \\"Zilver\\" (2006)  References  External links  * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Fantastic art Category:Contemporary painters Category:People from Oss Category:AKV St. Joost alumni ","title":"Chris Berens"},{"id":"27007410","text":"William Parnell Greene Jr. (born July 27, 1943)Official Congressional Directory (2007) - page 875 is a former Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Greene was appointed by President Bill Clinton to a fifteen-year term as a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims on November 7, 1997. He assumed the responsibilities of the Chief Judge of the Court on August 8, 2005, holding that position until August 6, 2010. At the time of his nomination and appointment to the Court, Judge Greene was serving as a United States Immigration Judge. From June 13, 1993, until November 22, 1997, he presided over immigration cases in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Born in Bluefield, West Virginia, Greene received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from West Virginia State College in 1965, and a Juris Doctor from Howard University School of Law in 1968. Following graduation from law school and admission to the West Virginia Bar, he was appointed a commissioned officer in the United States Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. During his career as a Judge Advocate, he completed his military education at the Basic, Advanced, and Military Judges' courses at The Judge Advocate General's School, Charlottesville, Virginia; the Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; and the U.S. Army War College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Before becoming an Immigration Judge, Judge Greene held numerous positions in the United States Army. He served as the Chief Prosecutor at Fort Knox, Kentucky, followed by duty as the Chief Defense Counsel in the Army Command in Hawaii. He was the Army's chief recruiter for lawyers from 1974 to 1977 and in 1981, the Judge Advocate General of the Army selected him as the Department Chair of the Criminal Law Division at The Judge Advocate General's School. He also served in Germany as the Deputy Staff Judge Advocate of the Third Infantry Division and in Korea as the Staff Judge Advocate of the Second Infantry Division. Following his graduation from the U.S. Army War College in 1986, he was selected to serve as the Staff Judge Advocate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. That assignment was followed by another selection as Staff Judge Advocate at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, with duties that also included legal oversight of the Armed Forces' maximum security prison. While serving in this last position, he was selected and appointed by the Attorney General of the United States as a United States Immigration Judge. He retired as a Colonel from the United States Army in 1993 to accept that appointment. During his Army service, he received several awards including three awards of the Legion of Merit. On October 7, 1997, the Secretary of the Army designated Judge Greene as Honorary Colonel of the Judge Advocate General's Corps Regiment. In October 2000, Judge Greene was recognized as a Distinguished Member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps Regiment. Additionally, in May 2008 Chief Judge Greene was the recipient of the Chief Justice John Marshall Lifetime Achievement Award presented by the Judge Advocates Association. Greene is married to the former Madeline Sinkford, also of Bluefield, West Virginia. They have two sons: William Robert, a major customer manager for Dun and Bradstreet, and Jeffery, an officer and physician in the United States Army Medical Corps.

Ure Smith) They're a Weird Mob is a popular Australian comic novel written by John O'Grady under the pseudonym \\"Nino Culotta\\", the name of the main character of the book. The book was the first published novel by O'Grady, with an initial print run of 6,000 hardback copies. In less than six months, the book had been reprinted eight times and sold 74,000 copies. In the first year of publication, over 130,000 copies were sold. By the time of O'Grady's death in 1981, They're A Weird Mob was in its forty-seventh impression, with sales approaching the one million mark. Published by Ure Smith in 1957, the manuscript had been earlier rejected by publisher Angus & Robertson, and is reputedly the result of a ten pound bet between O'Grady and his brother, novelist Frank O'Grady. Plot Giovanni 'Nino' Culotta\\"Culotta\\" is rough Italian slang for \\"big arse\\" is an Italian immigrant, who comes to Australia as a journalist, employed by an Italian publishing house, to write articles about Australians and their way of life for those Italians who might want to emigrate to Australia. In order to learn about real Australians, Nino takes a job as a brickie's labourer with a man named Joe Kennedy. The comedy of the novel revolves around his attempts to understand English as it was spoken in Australia by the working classes in the 1950s and 1960s. Nino had previously only learned 'good' English from a textbook. The novel is a social commentary on Australian society of the period; specifically male, working class society. Women mostly feature as cameos in the story with the exception of Kay (whose surname is not revealed in the novel), who becomes Nino's wife. In the novel, Nino meets Kay in a cafe in Manly and their introduction is effected by Nino trying to teach Kay that she cannot eat spaghetti using a spoon. The final message of the novel is that immigrants to Australia should count themselves fortunate and should make efforts to assimilate into Australian society, including learning to speak Australian English. However, there is also a satirical undercurrent aimed at Australian society as a country of migrants. Sequels The book has three sequels which feature largely the same cast of characters: * Cop this Lot (1960) where Nino and his family travel to Italy to meet his parents * Gone Fishin' (1962) where Nino, suffering from nervous exhaustion, leaves building for the life of a professional fisherman, fishing the Georges River * Gone Gougin' :The weird mob in the opal fields (1975) in which Nino's two children (Young Nino and Maria) are now adults The novel Gone Fishin' is the only novel not to feature the main characters from the first two books, Joe, Edie and Dennis as primary characters. They finally appear onwards from chapter 11 (page 162), and Dennis finally gets engaged. In the following book, Gone Gougin' , only Nino, Joe and Dennis (now married) appear, and their wives are only briefly mentioned. Media hype The success of the novel projected Nino Culotta to initial fame and stardom; although O'Grady was writing under a pseudonym. There were initial requests for biographical information and author interviews, and even an invitation for Nino to appear at Melbourne's Moomba celebrations ‚Äì all of which had to be rejected by O'Grady's publisher. Eventually, some two months after the novel's first release, it was strategically revealed that O'Grady was the author. Tiring of the fame that Culotta was generating, O'Grady turned down an offer from Sir Frank Packer to write a regular column in Weekend magazine, stating: \\"Culotta does not write again until he is ready ... I have no interest in Culotta any more\\" and is reputed to have delivered Culotta's eulogy in 1960 in a pub in Toongabbie in the western suburbs of Sydney. Adaptations *The novel was adapted for the TV series telestory in 1961‚Äì62 with actor Gordon Glenwright reading the book in 22 instalments. This was the second such production on Australian TV ‚Äì Leonard Teale had read The Sundowners. *The novel was adapted into a 1966 film of the same name, starring Walter Chiari, Chips Rafferty and Claire Dunne.

Sacked for his poor performance during the Siege of Tobruk, he later briefly commanded the 16th Motorised Infantry Division during the advance on Moscow. A veteran of World War I, he was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Early life Born in Augustenburg on 16 April 1891, Streich joined the army of Imperial Germany as an Fahnen-junker (officer cadet) in 1911 after completing his schooling. He was commissioned into the 2nd Railroad Regiment, stationed at Berlin-Sch√∂neberg and operating the Royal Prussian Military Railway, as a leutnant (second lieutenant) two years later. During World War I, he served on both the Western and Eastern Fronts and was awarded the Iron Cross, both 1st and 2nd classes. He ended the war as an oberleutnant (first lieutenant) and company commander. Interwar period Streich was retained in the postwar Reichswehr (Imperial Defence) and, having developed an interest in motorized warfare, in 1921 was based in Hannover as a commander of motor transport company. He was promoted to hauptmann (captain) two years later. By 1930 he was an advisor in the Army Ordnance Office and played a role in the development of armoured vehicles including the Panzer I tank. He took command of 15th Panzer Regiment in 1935, having been promoted oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel). His new command was part of 8th Panzer Brigade, 5th Panzer Division, and was part of the force that occupied the Sudetenland in 1938. As a regimental commander, Streich had difficult relationships with two of his battalion commanders. By early 1939, tensions had escalated to the point where Streich's divisional commander had to resolve the situation by moving the two junior officers to new roles with other units. World War II Streich's 15th Panzer Regiment played only a minor role in the Invasion of Poland but was more prominent in the Battle of France the following year. It was involved in the encirclement of French forces at Lille and then the Battle of Dunkirk. After the British evacuation, the regiment made for the Seine and then onto Rouen. At one stage, Streich had a dispute with Generalmajor Erwin Rommel, whose 7th Panzer Division was operating nearby, over some bridging equipment. His regiment ended the French campaign near the Spanish border having made 20,000 French and British soldiers prisoners of war. He would be awarded the Knight's Cross for his regiment's capture of Veules-les-Roses while it was in the process of being evacuated. Streich's panzers overran the town during a night attack and captured thousands of prisoners including two brigade commanders and the French division commander G√©n√©ral Durant. In early 1941, Streich was given command of the 5th Panzer Brigade, 4th Panzer Division. Shortly afterwards he was promoted to generalmajor and was appointed commander of the 5th Light Division. North Africa The 5th Light Division was still in the process of being formed and was only activated on 18 February 1941. Shortly afterwards it was dispatched to Libya to join the newly formed Afrika Korps, commanded by Rommel, now a generalleutnant. Although Streich arrived in the country in late February, his division was not complete until the following month. From 31 March, it was involved in Operation Sonnenblume (Operation Sunflower) and Streich's forces largely destroyed the British 2nd Armoured Division. Nonetheless, Rommel was not impressed with his leadership, considering him too cautious and slow in his advance. When Streich opposed orders to attack the town of Mechili on 7 April on the grounds his division was not prepared, Rommel accused him of cowardice. The accusation was retracted when Streich threatened to return his Knight's Cross. As the advance moved onto Tobruk, Streich continued to be conservative with the use of his forces and Rommel grew increasingly frustrated after attacks mounted on Tobruk on 12 and 13 April failed. Given a final chance to capture the port in early May, Streich failed again and Rommel relieved him of his command. Streich returned to Germany and Generaloberst Franz Halder, the head of the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) and an acquaintance from his time at the Army Ordnance Office, soon found him a new assignment on the Eastern Front. Eastern Front Originally a commander of a battle group during Operation Barbarossa, Streich was soon given command of the 16th Motorised Infantry Division when its commanding officer, Generalleutnant Sigfrid Henrici, fell ill. At the time, it was engaged in the Battle of Kiev before being transferred to Generaloberst Heinz Guderian's 2nd Panzer Army to participate in the advance on Moscow. He was soon criticised by Guderian for the division's slow pace and when Henrici recovered his health and resumed command of the division in November 1941, Streich was returned to Germany. Later life After his return to Berlin, Streich was without a post for seven months until Halder made him inspector of mobile troops for OKH. This was not a significant role and nor was his following appointment, commander of Recruiting Area Breslau, in June 1943. He received a promotion to generalleutnant in October 1943. He was able to avoid the encirclement of Breslau by the Soviet Army in February 1945 and made his way to Berlin where he was made commander of that city's Recruiting Area. He evaded the Soviet Army when they captured Berlin and was able to surrender to the Allies in the west. Held as a prisoner of war for three years, he later lived in Hamburg and died there on 20 August 1977.

The Yellow Jackets were led by 3rd year head coach Paul Johnson and played their home games at Bobby Dodd Stadium. They are members of the Atlantic Coast Conference in the Coastal Division. They finished the season 6‚Äì7, 4‚Äì4 in ACC play. They were invited to the Independence Bowl where they were defeated by Air Force 7‚Äì14. ScheduleRankingsRegular season=South Carolina State Pregame Line: South Carolina State +34 The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets opened their season with a victory against the Bulldogs of South Carolina State, 41‚Äì10. This match up pitted two defending conference champions against each other. The Jackets winning the ACC championship with a record of 11‚Äì3 and the Bulldogs the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference championship in the FCS with a record of 10‚Äì2. The Jackets opened the scoring 35-yard run by quarterback Joshua Nesbitt. Nesbitt became the focus of the offense that lost the leading receiver, Demaryius Thomas, and leading rusher, Jonathan Dwyer, from last year's team. He finished the day with 130 yards and three rushing touchdowns. Rounding out the scoring were B-back Roddy Jones with two touchdown runs and backup quarterback Tevin Washington with one touchdown run. Tech's option offense worked well gaining 384 total yards, 372 of those coming on the ground. South Carolina State's offense although not scoring a lot was able to move the ball on the new Al Groh 3‚Äì4 Defensive scheme. The Bulldogs were led by Asheton Jordan who ran for 125 yards on 17 carries and set up the Bulldogs' only touchdown with a 55-yard run to the Georgia Tech 3 in the third quarter. Quarterback Malcolm Long then scored from a yard out. Long was 11‚Äì25 passing for 94 yards. On the day SCSU amassed total 272 yards. The other score came when a 17-play drive stalled at the Georgia Tech 5-yard line and Blake Erickson converted a 28-yard field goal. Kansas Pregame Line: Kansas +14 After a disappointing loss the previous week to North Dakota State, the Jayhawks of Kansas tried to spark a change by starting freshman QB Jordan Webb. On the first drive Webb was able to move the ball by completing several short passes. The drive stalled after a sack by Isaiah Johnson. The Jackets marched down the field and Nesbitt scored on a ten-yard run. The Jayhawks took advantage of a kickoff out of bounds scoring after a couple of runs and a handful of passes. Evening the score 7‚Äì7. Kansas then scored on a play action pass taking a 14‚Äì7 lead. The Jackets added another score on a Nesbitt run and a field goal before the half. Taking the lead 14‚Äì17. After the half Kansas added a rushing touchdown and a passing touchdown giving them a 28‚Äì17 lead. When the Yellow Jacket defense stopped Kansas and forced the Jayhawks to punt. The Jackets got the ball in good field position because of a fair catch interference penalty. A passer interference penalty moved GT to the brink of field goal range. But a false start penalty on a fourth down with three yards to go left the jackets in a passing situation and just out of comfortable field goal range. The subsequent slant route was on target yet Stephen Hill was unable to hold on to make the completion. Georgia Tech rushed for 356 yards and racked up 407 yards of offense, but the defense could not stop Kansas' newly arraigned QB and the Jayhawk offense. Josh Nesbitt and Stephen Hill connected on a 52-yard touchdown midway through the fourth quarter, followed by a two-point conversion which put the game at 28‚Äì25. On the day Kansas had a total of 320 yards, 179 in the air and 141 on the ground. James Sims another freshmen getting his first start led the Jayhawks in rushing with 101 yards on 17 carries. Anthony Allen led the Jackets in with 89 yards on 11 carries. North Carolina Pregame Line: North Carolina ‚Äì3 After receiving the opening kickoff the Tar Heels moved the ball down the field. Completing several passes and countering with quick runs. With senior running back Johnny White finding holes and running hard. A defense that didn't show much resistance during the drive stiffened inside of 10 yards to hold UNC to a field goal. After the ensuing kick off it only took two plays with a modest game before Orwin Smith was able to take a pitch the length of the field for the touchdown. Leaving the Jackets ahead 3‚Äì7. UNC next scored on a long pass to Eric Highsmith who was left open on a blown coverage by a young safety. Roddy Jones was then able to score a receiving touchdown pass, making it 10‚Äì14. Yates was finding ways to get the ball to receivers and the receivers were finding ways to make catches. Taking the ball 80 yards on the next drive and sneaking it in from the 1-yard line. The Jackets countered with a field goal to end the half, leaving it even at 17. The first miscue came from Georgia Tech when they fumbled a pitch when Roddy Jones slipped while in motion and lost pitch relationship. Giving the Tar Heels good field position they took a 24‚Äì17 lead on a run by White. Another fumble on their next drive caused Georgia Tech to punt. Then a fumble by Yates after running into his fullback returned the ball to the Jackets. A big third down pass with eleven yards to go saw Nesbitt find Jones after scrambling. Jones escaped down to the five-yard line. Tech found the end zone after a run by Allen and a Nesbitt keeper. Bringing the score to 24‚Äì24. On its next drive UNC was forced to punt. This drive saw the Jackets only incompletion which came when Embry Peeples caught the pass but was unable to stay in bounds. This setup Scott Blair with a 46-yard field goal which he was able to convert. Giving them 27‚Äì24 lead. The Tar Heels next drive was ended when Zack Pianalto fumbled a completed pass. The Jackets were able to add another field goal before the end of the game. North Carolina State Pregame Line: North Carolina State +7.5 Coming back from a 31‚Äì14 deficit in the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech offered a fighting chance at defeating North Carolina State when Jerrard Tarrant returned a Russell Wilson interception for a touchdown with 12:25 remaining. Josh Nesbitt found a wide open Tyler Melton early in the final quarter to cut the N.C. State lead to ten at 31‚Äì21. Tarrant's interception came on N.C. State's ensuing drive. Tech earned itself a swivel of momentum as it strove to garner victory at Bobby Dodd Stadium. However, N.C. State and superstar quarterback Russell Wilson responded by scoring two touchdowns against Tech's vulnerable secondary to seal victory for the wolfpack in Atlanta. Wake Forest Pregame Line: Wake Forest +9.5 Trailing 17‚Äì6 in the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech bested Wake Forest on the strength a comeback led by Quarterback Joshua Nesbitt, A-back Embry Peeples, and WR Correy Earls to shock the Demon Deacons in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Following a Scott Blair 43-yard field goal, Georgia Tech found itself at 4th and 5 on Wake Forest's thirty-yard line, where Josh Nesbitt found Embry Peeples for a Touchdown pass. Tech needed to convert a two-point conversion to tie the game. Paul Johnson and the Yellow Jackets did just that, executing the same play it ran against the University of Georgia in Athens on November 29, 2008 ‚Äì when it tied that ballgame at 28. The Tech defense allowed Wake Forest to earn a field goal on the next drive. However, on Tech's ensuing drive, veteran Quarterback Josh Nesbitt took the team on his shoulders, leading the Tech offense down the field. Nesbitt converted a 4th and 5 in the process with a twenty-yard scramble for a first down. To cap off the thrilling comeback, Nesbitt found senior wideout Correy Earls on a slant route with 15 seconds left in the endzone. Tech took the lead 24-20. The win preserved Coach Johnson's streak of zero consecutive losses, and increased his record to 23‚Äì9 at Georgia Tech. Virginia Pregame Line: Virginia +10 As the Yellow Jackets and Cavaliers met in Atlanta it pitted Al Groh against his former team for the first time. Groh was head coach at Virginia since 2000 before taking over as defensive coordinator at Tech. Although Virginia was able to move the ball for 376 yards they had no luck slowing down the Jackets who racked up 536 yards. Tech opened the scoring with a field goal. Then Virginia was able to reach the end zone. The rest of the day was all Jackets as they added a field goal and a touchdown before the half. Anthony Allen led the Jackets in rushing with 195 yards on 25 carries. He was followed by Nesbitt who had 109 yards on 21 carries. Vercia was able to amass 239 passing yards while going 18/31, his leading receiver on the day was Snyder with 96 yards. Middle Tennessee Pregame Line: Middle Tennessee State +18.5 The Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders of the Sun Belt Conference traveled to Atlanta challenge the Yellow Jackets of Georgia Tech. The Jackets' defense were able to force 6 turnovers during the course of the game, 2 fumbles and 4 interceptions. The Jackets were also able to spread the ball around the offense with 12 different players carrying the ball. With Nesbitt and Allen leading the way. Clemson Pregame Line: Clemson ‚Äì3.5 Georgia Tech and Clemson were both looking for big conference wins to stay in the hunt for a spot in the ACC Championship Game. Andre Ellington was the story for the Tiger's offense as he was able to find the endzone 3 times. Georgia Tech was never really able to get the wheels rolling on offense as they were held under 250 yards rushing. This from the nation's leading rushing team averaging over 300 yards per game. They were also able to hold Nesbitt to just 2 total yards rushing. This includes yardage loss on sacks. Nesbitt has rushed for over a 100 yards in 4 of 7 games this year. Virginia Tech Pregame line: Virginia Tech ‚Äì 13.5 The Jackets traveled to Lane Stadium to play a nationally televised Thursday night game. Since the league was split into two divisions either the Jackets or the Hokies have represented the Coastal Division in the ACC Championship Game. For the previous three years the winner of this match- up had gone on to win the ACC. Georgia Tech took the opening kick-off and marched down the field. Starting with a 27-yard pitch to Orwin Smith, the drive, also featured Anthony Allen who also racked up 27 yards but on 5 carries. Nesbitt carried twice on the drive, once for 3 yards and a 1-yard carry into the endzone. After the Hokies first drive stalled the Jackets got the ball back on their 20-yard line. On the third play of the Jacket's drive Nesbitt rumbled for 71 yards to find the endzone before any Hokies were able to chase him down. In their next possession Virginia Tech was able to drive the field and keep the score close. Tyrod Taylor was able to complete passes and scramble when needed to keep the drive alive but the drive was really led by the running of Ryan Williams. Williams touched the ball 6 times on the drive for 34 yards on the 10 play 73-yard drive. The Jackets were forced to punt on their next drive. On a third and goal play from the 8 Georgia Tech's Rod Sweeting was able to come up with a huge interception in the endzone. The favor was returned and then some on the next drive. Georgia Tech punted after a penalty and a sacked stalled their drive. The return was fumbled and the Jackets recovered. A 33-yard run by Allen put the Jackets in the red zone. On a third and goal from the 6 Nesbitt's pass was intercepted and the QB broke his right arm while trying to bring down the return man. Although Nesbitt would miss the rest of the game and the season with the injury it was not before he took over the all-time lead for rushing for the QB position in the ACC. The whole third quarter saw the Jackets and the Hokies trade possessions many times with no one adding to the scoreboard. The Jackets reserve QB Tevin Washington played well but the Jackets sorely missed their Senior leader. The Hokies were next to score. A passer interference call on the Jackets moved the Hokies close enough for David Wilson to find the end zone, tying the score at 14-14. The Jackets were still yet to find a rhythm after losing their QB and had to punt once again. The Hokies continued to run well, this time on the legs of Darren Evans. Taking the lead 21‚Äì14 on a pass from Tyrod to Andre Smith. With only 6 minutes left in the game the Jackets were searching for a spark to get them back in the hunt. The spark came when on the first play Washington complete a 42-yard pass to Tyler Melton. The Jackets then found themselves on fourth down with 4 yards to go. The ball was pitched to Roddy Jones who stopped and looked to throw back to Washington who was covered. Jones was able to tuck the ball, run up the middle, and get past the down marker to pick up a first down. The Jackets capped the drive with a 9-yard touchdown rush by Orwin Smith with just over 2 minutes left to play. The ensuing kickoff was returned 90 yards for a touchdown by David Wilson putting the Hokies up, 28‚Äì21. The Jackets made an effort on their last drive. A sack for a loss of 2 yards on the first play, then a false start, and an incomplete pass left Jackets with a third and 17. Tevin Washington dropped back to pass and all receivers are covered but after picking up a block from Allen Washington scrambled for a first down. After another incompletion and false start Washington complete a pass to Kevin Cone for 38 yards. So with just over 40 seconds left the Jackets move into striking distance at the Hokies' 37-yard line. After a pairing of rushes and timeouts the Jackets were on the 16 with 14 seconds left. Washington's attempted fade to the end zone saw Tyler Melton with single coverage by Rashad Carmichael in the end zone. Carmichael was able to out-battle Melton for the slightly underthrown ball by the inexperienced Washington. This was the first time in the Paul Johnson era at Georgia Tech that his team had had back-to-back loses. Miami (FL) Pregame Line: Miami (FL) ‚Äì2.5 In this match-up Miami was looking to stay poised to challenge Virginia Tech for the Coastal Division in their game next week. Both clubs would be starting backup quarterbacks as Jacory Harris was sidelined with a concussion and Joshua Nesbitt out with a broken arm. Tevin Washington stepped in for Nesbitt and didn't have a bad day statistically except for the one that matters most, score. The Jackets were able to rack up 409 total yards, 308 rushing and 101 passing, but could only must 10 points on the day. Washington was the leading rusher with 122 yards on 21 carries followed by Orwin Smith with 88 yards and Allen with 77 yards. Kevin Cone was the leading receiver for the Jackets with 3 catches for 42 yards and a touchdown. Miami's offense was just too much for the Jackets' defense. The true freshmen Stephen Morris was able to step in for Harris and spread the ball around to Miami's many weapons. Gaining 507 yards on the day, 230 in the air and 277 on the ground. Hankerson was the leading receiver with 132 yards and a touchdown. The running attack was handle by committee with 7 backs rushing for positive yards. Lamar Miller, Damien Berry, Mike James, and Graig Cooper all were able to find the endzone. Duke Pregame Line: Duke +10 Things didn't look good early for the Yellow Jackets of Georgia Tech as they looked for their 6th win of the season to make them bowl eligible. The first quarter saw both teams able to convert on field goals as a big block in the back penalty called back a touchdown rush by Anthony Allen. In the second Tech added another field goal to make it 6‚Äì3. On the next possession the Blue Devils were able to catch the Jackets off-guard with a fake punt. Just three plays later Duke backup QB Brandon Connette scampered for 20 yards for the score. On the ensuing kickoff an illegal formation moved the Blue Devils back 5 yards. The re-kick saw an offsides call on Duke. Even though Tech got the ball with good field position they were unable to capitalize. Duke was able to add another field goal to take a 6‚Äì13 lead into the half. Play resumed after the half with a Duke fumble on the kickoff that was recovered by B.J. Bostic. The Jackets were able to add a field goal to bring it to 9‚Äì13. Duke's next drive ended with a big play from the Jackets' defense. Brandon Connette the backup QB who is usually brought in to run a wild cat type running attack was intercepted by Mario Butler. Butler was able to return the interception 85 yards for a touchdown giving the lead to the Jackets, 16‚Äì13. Duke's next drive stalled and Tech's offense was finally able to hit a stride as they were able to run up the middle for good yardage over the next drive. Washington scored from 1 yard out to take the score to 23‚Äì13. In the fourth quarter Duke made an attempt to get back in the game as Sean Renfree completed a touchdown pass to Austin Kelly to bring the score to 23-20. After trading possessions Tech rounded out the scoring with a pass to Stephen Hill for 79 yards. With the win, the Yellow Jackets maintained their conference record of years finishing at .500 or better in the ACC for 16 straight seasons. They also became bowl eligible for the 14th straight season.

Presentation of the organization Chez Stella Logo ‚ÄúStella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie‚Äù is the only community group in Montreal that works exclusively and specifically with sex workers. Founded in 1995, ‚Äúby and for‚Äù community organization has the goal of improving the life and work conditions of all women-identified sex workers in Montreal. Their programs also promote good health practices and the respect for the human rights of sex workers. The organization encourages empowerment and solidarity by and amongst sex workers, which means that all its actions favour the individual and collective responsibility of these sex workers.Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie. 2009. Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie, official website. http://www.chezstella.org/. (accessed February 13th). Stella serves all kinds of sex workers and maintains an ongoing presence in sex work venues, including streets, escort agencies, massage parlors and strip bars. The organization initially started with a founding board of four employees, and a dedicated group of volunteers and sympathizers. There is no specific religious affiliation within this organization. Stella participants are active on a number of committees, coalitions, research groups and boards of directors. Stella representatives are often invited to give lectures at conferences highlighting issues related to sex work. The organization is also regularly invited to participate in artistic projects and events in Montreal. For example, in 2001, Stella took part in \\"Six personnages en qu√™te d'auteur\\", a play directed by Wajdi Mouawad at the Th√©√¢tre de Quatre‚Äôsous.‚ÄùStella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie. 2009. Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie, official website.http://www.chezstella.org/. (accessed February 13th). Stella works at the municipal, provincial and national level to promote sex workers‚Äô rights, but also at the international level where it has affiliated with sex worker rights groups all over the world to fight for the same cause‚Äîthe decriminalization of sex work. As explained in the ‚ÄúDear Client‚Äù guide, one of the most asked question is ‚ÄúWhy do sex workers do sex work?‚Äù The answer given by the organization Stella is ‚ÄúSex work is work: an activity that generates income. Sex workers work first and foremost for money‚Äù.Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie. 2004. Sex Work, Dear Client, Manual intended for clients of sex workers. Montr√©al. History of the Organization Stella was born in 1995 after the work of a consultative committee set up by the AIDS Study Center in collaboration with the AQTTS, (L‚Äôassociation Qu√©b√©coise des travailleuses et travailleurs du sexe), some community-based organization representatives (Centre-ville et Centre-Sud de Montr√©al) and doctors in epidemiology. The sex workers involved in the committee's work on HIV prevention suggested that the best way to reduce HIV is to improve the life conditions and work conditions of sex workers. To that end, Stella opened its doors in April 1995 to specifically support cisgender and transgender women working in the sex industry, including street workers, escorts, porn actress, erotic dancers, etc. Stella set up a participative structure where women current or former sex workers would have a major input at every level of the organization - as volunteers, as members of the administration council or just a member of the working team. Stella acknowledges that their knowledge and experience are invaluable for developing actions and its tools that best suit the specific needs of all sex workers.Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie. 2009. Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie, official website.http://www.chezstella.org/. (accessed February 13th). Objectives According to their website, the main goals of Stella are: * To counteract violence done to sex workers and the different factors that gets them to be infected with HIV and STIs, that threats their physical integrity; * To fight discrimination, isolation and the stigmatization lived by the sex workers; * To promote the decriminalization of the different kinds of sex works; * To provide support and information to sex- workers so that they may live in safety and with dignity; * To sensitize and educate the public about sex work and the realities faced by sex workers; * To encourage and support the participation of sex workers to the community and in the making of collective actions; * To favour the creation of exchange platforms on the sex work, at the municipal, provincial, national and international level. Stella favors empowerment and solidarity by and amongst sex workers, since the organization's worldview is that all sex workers internationally are committed to the idea that each of them has a place in society, and human rights worth defending.Website. http://www.chezstella.org/. (accessed February 13th). Current activities Stella is an ongoing organization that works in different levels of the society to promote some new understanding of the sex industry for sex workers and for the general public. It goes from helping sex workers to fight hepatitis or HIV, to publishing magazines, doing workshop for students or sex workers, working with the government for the decriminalization of the sex industry in Montreal and internationally to helping sex workers to get some work experience within a social justice organization. The current activities are divided in two different sections: (1) Information and (2) Outreach. The following offers only a summary of each. For more details about the extensive activities of Stella visit their website. Chez Stella 1. Information Stella has a number of activities that are focused on welcoming, supporting and informing the sex workers. All of these are available through a number of community- based organizations situated in the hot spots for street prostitution in Montreal. Services include: * phone line, * drop in community meals * Medical clinics (2X per month in collaboration with Medecin du Monde, tracking, vaccination hepatitis A and B, Chez Stella advertisement and Logo #2gynecologists, etc...) * free vaccination clinics for hepatitis A and B in bars and detentions building * legal clinics at Stella's offices * Visits to sex workers in prison. * programs of educative and community activities at Stella's locals Stella also provides sex workers with support through the judicial process, social services and health services.Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie. 2009. Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie, official website.http://www.chezstella.org/. (accessed February 13th). 2. Outreach Stella supports a number of outreach programs that go out into the environment where sex workers live and work. For example: * the districts where there is a concentration of street prostitution; * hotels and bars where the prostitutes or escorts recruit/bring their clients; * bars with erotic dancers; * restaurants and coffee shops where the sex workers take their breaks; * escorts agencies, massage parlors, and the sex workers' apartment where they receive the clients; * the places where the prostitutes toxicomans squat; * pornographic film set, * the incarceration buildings (federals and provincials) =Goals of Outreach= # To train volunteers (the majority being sex workers) about the individual and collective responsibility of sex workers; # To mobilize sex workers for collective action efforts (actions, Forum XXX, International AIDS Conferences, etc.); # To research and to analyze sex worker activities especially HIV/AIDS prevention efforts (this program is in collaboration with university and community partners); # To circulate study results; # To create workshops to education outreach workers, social workers and anyone in the general public who works with sex workers about sex workers' realities ;Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie. 2009. Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie, official website.http://www.chezstella.org/. (accessed February 13th). Bad Tricks List Another brilliant and useful activity done by this social justice organization is the ‚ÄúBad Tricks and Assaulters Lists‚Äù. It is a list given by sex workers to share the knowledge of dangerous people that might be in certain districts. This list is very useful for the sex workers and is published in the monthly bulletin and in the bi-yearly magazine called ConStellation.Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie. 2009. Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie, official website. http://www.chezstella.org/. (accessed February 13th). Constellation Magazine published by Chez Stella Publications Stella prepares a number of publications of interest to sex workers including: * Constellation a free magazine for sex workers * Bulletin Stellaire * Hepatitis C brochure * Clients guide * violence prevention brochure * Guide XXX * Striptease guide Stella also manages a website with all resources available electronically. All publications are bilingual and the Hepatitis C and the clients' guide are trilingual (French, English and Inuktitut).Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie. 2009. Stella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie, official website.http://www.chezstella.org/. (accessed February 13th). As an example of its usage here is a part of the latest ConStellation's editorial magazine. ‚ÄúBy taking the initiative to produce a ConStellation that addresses the 7 major sectors of the sex industry through interviews with women who work in the pornography, erotic massage, street prostitution, domination, webcam, erotic dancing and the world of escorts, the Stella team has killed two birds with one stone. In addition to giving us a chance to share our knowledge about business and providing us with the opportunity to learn from each other, this ConStellation also presents a faithful portrait of the sex industry, with all that this implies, in North America today.‚ÄùStella, l‚Äôamie de Maimie. 2009. Editorial. Working condition special ConStellation, april10th. (Available online: http://www.chezstella.org/stella/?q=en/constellation2009 (accessed February 20th)). This proves an example of the use and the importance of these publications; to inform the general public and the sex workers from the sex industry about good tips, and share their experience of this sometimes challenging job. Public Outreach The last part of Stella's work for the improvement of the sex workers' lives is more focused on the sensitizing of the general public and the interveners from the health care system and the social services as much as the policemen and policewomen to the problems and the realities and the preoccupations that the sex workers may have. For example, this sensitizing could be done through meetings with students or interested groups that want to have more information, by holding an information desk in major conferences or forums or to have a public conference or many more public activities. It could also be by the writing of activity reports or community media mass articles. This social justice organization also does a lot of information work of sensitizing to the shop owners, the people living in hot areas to participate actively in the different conversation tables of the districts and the group of organizations by themes.Tremblay, Francine. 2001.

(Available online : http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/1521/1/MQ64034.pdf (accessed February 27th)). All of these services are offered by employee and volunteer teams composed mostly by either sex-workers or ex sex-workers. Current Organizational Features As explained in the introduction, Stella started with only four employers and many volunteers; today on average twelve women work full-time for Stella and the membership continues to grow. There are many volunteers and sympathizers helping to write articles, draw the pictures for the publication, some also provide names for the List of assaults and lots of the volunteers work on the streets (outreach) to help other sex workers. The main team is formed of a president, a vice president, a treasurer, person-resource, administrators, outreach coordinator, outreach workers, clerk-receptionist, general coordinator, project officer, speakers and accounting. Funding for Stella activities comes from donations and fundraising efforts with project support from provincial, municipal and private bodies.

She was armed with eight 4-pounder guns, had a complement of 26 men, and was of 70 tons (bm). She participated in several single ship actions and took several prizes before the Navy returned her to her owners near the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Service In 1803 Lieutenant Isaac William ScottJames, William (1837), The Naval History of Great Britain, from the Declaration of War by to the Accession of George IV, Vol. 3, Richard Bentley, London, p. 199. Ebook (full view). took command of Princess Augusta for the North Sea. In the second week of September she delivered orders from Lord Keith to warships off Hellevoetsluis, Texel and the Elbe. Princess Augusta vs. Two Dutch privateers On 20 September, 45 miles northeast of Texel, she encountered two schooners that bore down on her and opened fire, killing two of Princess Augusta's crew and mortally wounding Scott. The two schooners were Dutch: Union, under Lieutenant Commander St. Faust, of 12 guns and 70 men, and Wraak, under Lieutenant Commander Doudet, of eight guns and 50 men. The Dutch attempted to board but were unable to do so. Eventually, they sailed off. In addition to the two men killed in the initial broadside, Princess Augusta had suffered three wounded, including Scott, who died the next morning. Command devolved on her Master, Joseph Thomas, who made for Dover. The tide was against them and they were unable to land until the afternoon of 23 September. Wraak reportedly lost one man killed and several wounded.James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 199. (Seven years later Thomas would be in command of the Hired armed cutter Queen Charlotte when he would participate in another, bloodier, but equally successful fight against great odds.Publications of the Navy Records Society, Volume 4, Index of Naval Officers, p. 161.) Later, someone signing himself \\"De Faust\\" wrote a letter to the Delft Courant claiming, inter alia, that Unie (Union) had carried only four small guns when he had put to flight Princess Augusta, of fourteen 8-pounder guns. He further asserted that only her sailing off had prevented him from boarding her.Naval Chronicle, (Jan-Jun 1805) Vol. 13, p. 47. Prize taking On 13 June 1804, while under the command of Lieutenant John Tracey, Princess Augusta, with a crew of only 25 men, encountered a 14-gun French privateer off Huntcliff.Naval Chronicle, (Jul-Dec 1805) Vol. 12, p. 51. Initially, Princess Augusta took the brig for a collier, but the brig's crowded decks signalled that she was a privateer. During the four-hour engagement Princess Augusta took several shot near the water line and sustained extensive damage to her rigging. Still, she suffered only three men wounded, though one desperately. The French vessel veered off on the approach of two schooners manned with Sea Fencibles from Redcar. The French privateer reportedly was under the command of a notorious pirate known as \\"Blackman\\".Suffolk notes from the year 1729. Compiled from the files of the \\"Ipswich Journal\\" (1883), p. 155. Towards the end of 1806 Princess Augusta captured several vessels. These were Neptunus (4 November), Onverwaght and Vrow Johanna (20 November), and Kitty (11 December). She also captured Morganstern, a fishing vessel, on 11 December. On 27 January 1807, while 45 miles off Lowestoft, Princess Augusta sighted a French privateer cutter and chased her for three hours. Tracey was eventually able to get alongside and after firing some guns and small arms into her, she struck. She was Jena, commanded by Captain Francis Capelle, of four guns and 30 men. She also had a great number of small arms on board. She was 12 days out of Flushing and had made two captures. The next day Princess Augusta recaptured Jenas prizes, Sophia and Courieur, one of them a Prussian ship, laden with timber and bound to London. Later that year Tracey transferred to the brig . On 19 February 1807 chased the French privateer cutter Chasseur into the hands of . At the time, Carrier was also in company with the hired armed cutters Princess Augusta, under the command of Lieutenant John Jenkins, and Princess of Wales. As Carrier was returning to her station, together with Princess Augusta, at 9 a.m. she sighted a suspicious sail ten leagues from Goree. After a chase of five hours she caught up with the French privateer schooner Ragotin. Ragotin, under the command of Jaques Jappie, carried eight guns, which she had thrown overboard during the chase, and a crew of 29 men. She was eight days out of Dunkirk, on her first cruise, and had not made any captures. By June 1807 Princess Augusta was under the command of Lieutenant Robert Jordan. On 2 June she captured Frau Barbara and Frau Gerina. On 26 July she captured Goede Hoope. Then on 10 October she re-captured the Cadiz Packet. On 19 November, she re-captured Sunneside. Lastly, on 30 December, she was under the command of Lieutenant Andrew McCulloch when she recaptured the Swedish brig Frederica. On 15 February 1808, Princess Augusta captured Johanna. While cruising some 40 miles north-west of the Texel on the evening of 5 March Princess Augusta encountered a French privateer cutter. After chasing her for 24 hours McCulloch drove her on shore at Katwick (Katwijk-aan-Zee near The Hague). As the winds were too strong to deploy the boats, he took the cutter in as close as possible and exchanged fire. By the evening of 8 March the weather moderated. The boats went in under a heavy small arms fire from the shore and destroyed the French boat. Fishermen told McCulloch that the privateer was Dunkerquois, of Dunkirk, mounting four 3-pounders and with a crew of 45 men. She was formerly the Revenue cutter Nimble of Deal. On 7 April Princess Augusta recaptured the galiot Aurora. Four days later, Princess Augusta and the hired armed cutter Alert recaptured Louisa, Vier Gebrooders, Twee Gebrooders, and Musche. The brig shared in the capture of Musche. On 17 July, in company with Alert, Princess Augusta captured Femme Fama, Deux Freres, and Hilkje Maria. Princess Augusta was in company with the gun-brig and when they captured the Dutch fishing vessels Meernia, Johanna, and Stadt Olderberg on 20 August 1808. Next, Princess Augusta captured the Swedish ship Midas on 10 November 1808. Cutting-out expedition On 21 July 1811, while still under McCulloch's command, she captured Vrow Geertje, alias La Femme Gertrude, Le Vrow Jantje, La Marguerita, Drey Gebroadrs, and Vry Gewaagt. Ten days later, on 1 August, Princess Augusta and Alert were part of a small squadron cruising off the coast between the Texel and the Elbe.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp. 339-41. The squadron was under the command of Captain Charles Sibthorpe Hawtayne of the 32-gun frigate . The other vessels of the squadron were the 16-gun brig , Commander George G. Lennock, and the gun-brigs and , Lieutenants James Murray and Sir George Mouat Keith, baronet. The squadron received intelligence from earlier captures of four Danish gun brigs lying at anchor at the island of Nordeney, and Hawtayne sent in a cutting-out party of 10 boats. Each Danish vessel had a crew of 25 men. The Danes were ready, and fired on the boats as they approached. The British immediately boarded and carried the first vessel but the other three resisted longer. Princess Augusta had one man killed and one wounded. The pilot to the expedition, James Muggeridge of Princess Augusta, was among the wounded. He was a volunteer and so not entitled to any disability pension, but fortunately his wound was minor. In all, the British lost four killed and 14 wounded. The Danes lost two men killed and ten men wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"2 Aug. Boat Service 1811\\" to the surviving claimants from this action. Prize taking On 9 April 1812, Princess Augusta was in company with when they captured the Danish vessels Frau Catherina Elizabeth and Emanuel. On 23 May 1813 Princess Augusta was in company with , , and when they captured the Danish vessels Jonge Greenwoldt, Hoffnung 1 and 2, and another vessel, name unknown. On 10 July Princess Augusta was part of a squadron that captured eight small vessels in the Elbe and Weser. The squadron included , under Captain Arthur Farquhar, who was the overall commander, Calliope, , , and gunboats. On 3 August Princess Augusta captured five small vessels called evers. On 5 January 1814 Princess Augusta was part of Farquhar's squadron, comprising Desiree, Hearty, , , Shamrock, Redbreast, and eight gun-boats, at the capitulation of the town and fortress of Gluckstadt during the War of the Sixth Coalition. On 15 July 1816 there was a first payment of ¬£5000 in prize money to the navy. Disposal Princess Augusta spent the remainder of her service with the Royal Navy apparently cruising uneventfully, in that there is no record of any actions, and escorting convoys. In May 1814, near the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Admiralty returned her to her owners.

Also known as Sheikh J√¢ni and Saint Jani, she was a charismatic figure and a mystical writer and poet in Kurdish and Persian language. She was the daughter of Hajj Nematollah and the sister of Ostad Elahi. There are few written sources about her life. Some elements can be found in the words of her brother Ostad ElahiNur Ali Elahi, Asar-ol Haqq (Words of Truth), Volume 1, Tehran, 3rd edition (1987) and Volume 2, Tehran (1991). Each volume is divided into numbered sayings. References to these volumes appear hereinafter as AH1 and AH2 followed by the number of the saying. whom she was very close to. A biography in French was published on the occasion of the centennial of her birth, including the translation of some of her poems and sayings.Leili Anvar, Malek J√¢n Ne'mati - La vie n'est pas courte mais le temps est compt√©, Diane de Selliers, Paris (2007). Biography Malak Jan was born into a family belonging to the mystical order the Ahl-e Haqq (literally ‚ÄúPeople of the Truth‚Äù). Her father Hajj Nematollah was an outstanding spiritual personality who gave up a comfortable life a few years before she was born to devote himself to finding the Truth. So from a very early age, Malak Jan was initiated with the rest of her family to asceticism and prayer, but also and above all to ethical and spiritual reflection. While in those days and in those remote regions of Kurdistan, new-born girls were greeted with condolences, it is noteworthy that Malak Jan received the same comprehensive education as her elder brother.Anvar, supra note 2, p. 35. With Kurdish as her mother tongue, she learned Persian and Arabic and set about studying the revealed books and the extremely rich Iranian poetry from which she would later draw her inspiration when writing her own poems.A number of her poems have been translated from Kurdish to French in Leili Anvar's book (cited above note 2), pp. 69-103. She was also given a musical education as she learned to play the tanbur (Kurdish lute accompanying Ahl-e Haqq sacred chants) and the setar (classical Persian lute). Hajj Nematollah was particularly fond of her. In keeping with his wish, she wore a white habit and bonnet ‚Äúso that people could not tell whether it was a boy or a girl‚Äù.AH2, 91. She actually wore that outfit throughout her life. When she was thirteen, she had to suffer the grief of losing her father. Shortly afterwards, she experienced a painful ocular condition and by the age of twenty, she was completely and permanently blinded. The loss of her eyesight, though, seems to have coincided with the awakening of a form of mystical passionAH2, 94. that led her to progressively draw closer to her brother Ostad Elahi and she became one of his most accomplished followers. When Ostad Elahi died, she quite naturally took up the torch of his spiritual teaching.Anvar, supra note 2, pp. 30 and 45 to 49. Progressively, Malak Jan's personality, her meaningful spiritual reflection and constant practice of charityAnvar, supra note 2, pp. 51-53 earned her a reputation for saintliness in her deeply religious milieu. People around her wrote down what she said and the advice she gave, and a certain number of their notes have been translated into French.Anvar (2007), pp. 105-132 Despite her handicap, Malak Jan spent her whole life studying anatomy, science, history, geography, using, for instance, audiotaped courses. This passion for knowledge amounted to a spiritual as well as an intellectual approach. Malak Jan was opposed to what she called ‚Äúsuperstitious spirit‚ÄùSee, Anvar, supra note 2, p. 42 and attempted to tackle spirituality with reflection and knowledge. She refused to blindly accept principles turned into dogmas: \\"In the beginning, I would say to myself: 'I have to understand by myself'. I would not believe what other people said. For instance, I had to understand by myself that there is a world beyond, that there is a God, that there are spiritual laws, that the soul is eternal‚Ä¶ I first resolved the question of the existence of God, then I understood that there is an Account and that no being will be wronged‚Ä¶\\"See, Anvar, supra note 2, pp. 44-45. Malak Jan first endeavored to progressively develop this way of dealing with spirituality among the peasants of Jeyhounabad, known in the country since then as \\"the village of philosophers\\".Anvar, supra note 2, p. 30. In the same spirit, she contributed to improving to living conditions of the villagers by having electricity brought or by inventing an interest-free microcredit system.Anvar, supra note 2, p. 56 Although living in a deeply patriarchal society, she used her spiritual authority to defend more specifically women's rights, by gradually teaching mothers to look after their daughters as much as their sons, by getting fathers to leave them a share of inheritance equal to that of their brothers.Anvar, supra note 2, p. 55 Towards the end of her life, Malak Jan brought a certain number of reforms to the Ahl-e Haqq form of worship that contributed to attributing women the same level of dignity as men on the ritual plane. To Ahl-e Haqq devotees these reforms amounted to a doctrinal revolution and the most traditionalist branches of the order expressed their hostility. Malak Jan Nemati died in 1993 in France after having open-heart surgery. She was buried in the Perche region of France, in a small village called Baillou.

Typically the integumentary system can be thought of as skin, however the integumentary system also includes the segmented exoskeleton in arthropods and feathers of birds. The primary role of the integumentary system is to provide protection for the body. However, the structure of the skin has evolved to aid animals in their different modes of locomotion. Soft bodied animals such as starfish rely on the arrangement of the fibers in their tube feet for movement. Eels, snakes, and fish use their skin like an external tendon to generate the propulsive forces need for undulatory locomotion. Vertebrates that fly, glide, and parachute also have a characteristic fiber arrangements of their flight membranes that allows for the skin to maintain its structural integrity during the stress and strain experienced during flight. Soft bodied locomotion in invertebrates The arms of octopus are muscular hydrostats The term \\"Soft Bodied\\" refers to animals which lack typical systems of skeletal support - included in these are most insect larvae and true worms. Animals that are soft bodied are constrained by the geometry and form of their bodies. However it is the geometry and form of their bodies that generate the forces they need to move. The structure of soft bodied skin can be characterized by a patterned fiber arrangement, which provides the shape and structure for a soft bodied animals. Internal to the patterned fiber layer is typically a liquid filled cavity, which is used to generate hydrostatic pressures for movement.Robert E. Shadwick. Foundations of animal hydraulics: Geodesic fibres control the shape of soft bodied animals. J Exp Biol, 211(3):289‚Äì291, February 2008. Some animals that exhibit soft bodied locomotion include starfish, octopus, and flatworms. Hydrostatic skeleton A hydrostatic skeleton uses hydrostatic pressure generated from muscle contraction against a liquid filled cavity. The liquid filled cavity is commonly referred to as the hydrostatic body. The liquid within the hydrostatic body acts as an incompressible fluid and the body wall of the hydrostatic body provides a passive elastic antagonist to muscle contraction, which in turn generates a force, which in turn creates movement.R. B. Clark and J. B. Cowey. Factors controlling the change of shape of certain nemertean and turbellarian worms. J Exp Biol, 35(4):731‚Äì748, December 1958. This structure plays a role in invertebrate support and locomotor systems and is used for the tube feet in starfish and body of worms . A specialized version of the hydrostatic skeleton is a called a muscular hydrostat, which consists of a tightly packed array of three-dimensional muscle fibers surrounding a hydrostatic body.William M. Kier and Kathleen K. Smith. Biomechanics(Structures and Systems):A Practical Approach.(1992).A.a. Biewener, ed. New York: IRL Press at Oxford Univ. Press. Examples of muscular hydrostats include the arms of octopus and elephant trunks. Fiber arrangement left- and right-handed helices The arrangement of the connective tissue fibers and muscle fibers create the skeletal support of a soft bodied animal. The arrangement of the fibers around a hydrostatic body limits the range of movement of the hydrostatic body (the \\"body\\" of a soft bodied animal) and defines the way the hydrostatic body moves. =Muscle fibers= Typically muscle fibers surround the hydrostatic body. There are two main types of muscle fibers orientations that are responsible for the movement: the circular orientations and longitudinal orientations.William M. Kier and Kathleen K. Smith. Tongues, tentacles and trunks: the biomechanics of movement in muscular-hydrostats.Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 83(4):307‚Äì324, 1985. Circular muscles decrease the diameter of a hydrostatic body, resulting in an increase in the length of the body, whereas longitudinal muscles shortens the length of a hydrostatic body, resulting in an increase in the diameter of the body. There are four categories of movements of a hydrostatic skeleton : elongation, shortening, bending and torsion. Elongation, which involves an increase in the length of a hydrostatic body requires either circular muscles, a transverse muscle arrangement, or radial muscle arrangement. For a transverse muscle arrangement, parallel sheets of muscle fibers that extend along the length of a hydrostatic body. For a radial muscle arrangement, radial muscles radiate from a central axis along the axis perpendicular to the long axis. Shortening involves the contraction of the longitudinal muscle. Both shortening and bending involve the contraction of longitudinal muscle, but for bending motion some of the antagonistic muscles work synergistically with longitudinal muscles. The amplitude of movements are based upon the antagonistic muscles forces and the amount of leverage the antagonistic muscle provides for movement. For the torsion motion, muscles are arranged in helical layers around a hydrostatic body. The fiber angle (the angle the fiber makes with the long axis of the body) plays a critical role in torsion, if the angle is greater than 54¬∞44', during muscle contraction, torsion and elongation will occur. If the fiber angle is less than 54¬∞44', torsion and shortening will occur. =Connective tissue fibers= The arrangement of connective tissue fibers determines the range of motion of a body, and serves as an antagonist against muscle contraction. The most commonly observed connective tissue arrangement for soft bodied animals consists of layers of alternating right and left-handed helices of connective tissue fibers which surround the hydraulic body. This cross helical arrangement is seen in the tube feet starfish, different types of worms and suckers in octopus. This cross helical arrangement allows for the connective tissue layers to evenly distribute force throughout the hydrostatic body. Another commonly observed connective tissue fiber range is when the connective tissue fibers are embedded within a muscle layer. This arrangement of connective tissue fibers creates a stiffer body wall and more muscle antagonism, which allows for more elastic force to be generated and released during movement. This fiber arrangement is seen in the mantle of squid and the fins in sharks. Specialized function in vertebrates=Swimming and undulatory locomotion The skin of these animal that use undulatory motion to locomote have several distinct characteristics. The skin of these animals consists of cross-helical arrangement of collagen and elastin fibers embedded in the dermal layer of skin,D.M. Pearson.Functional aspects of the skin in polypterus fishes. Zool. J. Linn. Soc. 72, 93‚Äì106. 1981 a two-dimensional stiffness. which permits bending at small curvatures and resists bending at high curvatures and skin is attached directly to the underlying muscles. Fish, shark, and snakes are all examples of animals that locomote using undulatory locomotion. =Eel= Closeup image of the skin of a marbled eel The cross helical fiber arrangement of the two dermal fibers types collagen and elastin, are responsible for the mechanical properties of the skinL. Yang. Mechanical properties of native and cross-linked type i collagen fibrils. Biophysical Journal, 94(6):2204‚Äì2211, March 2008. such as the two dimensional stiffness seen in the eel skin. In the longitudinal direction, eel skin behaves like a pure fiber system, with a lessertensile strength than skin in the hoop direction. The skin in the hoop direction exhibits a higher elastic modulus than the skin in the longitudinal direction.M R. Hebrank. Mechanical properties and locomotor functions of eel skin. Biol Bull, 158(1):58‚Äì68, February 1980. The two dimensional stiffness allows for the body of the eel to be modeled a pressurized cylinder with the fiber angle of the cross helical arrangement dictating the method by which the eel moves. Eel skin behaves like skin having a fiber angle greater than 45¬∞. In an eel with the cross helical fiber arrangement, muscle contraction in the anterior region bends the fish, and so the skin on the convex side is extended in the longitudinal direction. The extension in the longitudinal direction produces contraction in the hoop direction as the fiber angle decreases until these dimensional changes are resisted by the body of the eel. The skin becomes skin, and additional longitudinal force(applied by skin) results in force being transmitted along the tail. Therefore, changes in fiber angle of the cross helical arrangement in eel skin allows for the transmission of force through the skin during swimming. The skin act like an external tendon allowing for an eel to generate a greater propulsive force per muscle contraction. In addition to the eel skin acting as an external tendon, the skin attaches directly to the underlying muscle, which allow for the eel to generate an even greater force per muscle contraction. =Longnose gar= Closeup of the skin of the longnose garDue to the heavily scaled skin of the Longnose gar, some of the mechanical properties differ from model of describing how eel skin adds movement. The scale row resists longitudinal forces, which unlike eel skin, makes the skin stiffer in the longitudinal direction, providing myomeres with leverage and anchorage for pulling tendons. At low curvatures, it appears that the dermis is slack on both the concave and convex sides of the body. When the dermis is placed in tension, and resistance to bending is developed, which is referred to as flexural stiffness of the fish skin. The flexural stiffness is a result of the two dimensional stiffness of fish with heavily scaled skin, such as the longnose gar. This mechanical property of fish skin is important to the way a fish swims, because this mechanical property passively stiffens the body, which would otherwise would have been done muscularly.Long, J.H. Jr., Hale, M.E., McHenry, M.J.* and M.W. Westneat. (1996). Functions of fish skin: flexural stiffness and steady swimming of longnose gar, Lepisosteus osseus. Journal of Experimental Biology 199, 2139-2151. The flexural stiffness of fish skin act in a manner similar to the mechanism by which eel skin acts as an external tendon, however in the case of fish skin, the flexural stiffness acts as a mechanism to decelerate body movement rather than to generate a propulsive force. =Snake= Snakes are one of the few vertebrates in which the skin alone is sufficient for locomotion. During Rectilinear locomotion, the skeleton remains fixed, while the skin is alternately lifted and pulled forward, and then allowed to contact the ground and pulled backwards, propelling the body forward. One of the interesting aspects of snake skin are folds of intersquamous skin between longitudinally oriented scale rows.Savitzky, A. H., Townsend, V. R., Jr, Hutchinson, D. A. and Mori, A. (2004). Dermal characteristics, scale row organization, and the origin of macrostomy in snakes. J. Morphol. 260,325 The function of these folds is to permit the circumference of the snake to increase, allowing prey to pass into the stomach during feeling., S.J.Mullin. Adaptations facilitating facultative oophagy in the gray rat snake, Elaphe obsolete spiloides. Amphibia-Reptilia 17, 387-394. 1996 Snakes differ from eels in the direction in which the skin is stiffer, the dorsal scale rows are more flexible in snake than in eels because the dorsal scale row associated with stretching. Differences in the local dermal structures, such as variations in the diameters and orientation of collagen fibers within the intersquamous skin create local differences in the mechanical properties of the snake skin, thus allowing it to adapt to the stresses and strains during the feeding process.Gabriel Rivera, Alan H. Savitzky, and Jeffrey A. Hinkley. Mechanical properties of the integument of the common gartersnake, thamnophis sirtalis (serpentes: Colubridae). J Exp Biol, 208(15):2913‚Äì2922, August 2005. Aerial locomotion Gliding, Flying and Parachuting are some of the some methods of aerial locomotion used by animals. Vertebrates have altered the structure of the skin to accommodate the stresses and strains of flight. Typically mammalian skin consists of collagen fibers arranged in a felt-work pattern, with no preferential fiber orientation.Harkness, R. D. (1968). Mechanical properties of collagenous tissues. In Treatiseon collagen: 247-310. Gould, B. S. (Ed.). NY: Academic Press. However, the structures of skin in bats, birds, and gliding lizards are very different from those of typical mammalian skin. The structural arrangement of the fibers within bat wing skin enables the bat to act like a spring during the down-stroke of flapping. The scales of gliding lizards are arranged in a regular rib like pattern to enable to lizard to act as an airfoil. Avain skin must be structurally arranged such that \\"the coat of feathers\\" remains smooth and intact during flight. =Bats= Drawing of the bat wing skin showing the fibers of \\"mesh like scaffolding\\"A closeup view of the felt like fiber pattern seen in elephant skin Bats rely on skin on their wings to generate lift and thrust used in flight. Therefore, the structure of the bat wing skin is different from the skin of the bat body. Bat wing skin consists of two thin layers of epidermis with a thin layer of dermis/hypodermis located between the epidermal layers whereas the skin of the bat body consists of a single layer of epidermis with a thicker layer of dermis internal to the epidermis. Within the dermal and epidermal layer of bat wing skin, the connective tissue and muscle fibers provide the structural support. The connective tissue fibers within bat wing skin consists of collagen and elastin fiber bundles arranged in a \\"regular mesh like scaffolding\\",Holbrook, K & Oldand, g F. A collagen and elastic network in the wing of a bat. J Anat. 126:21-36 (1978) which the nerves, skeletal muscle fibers and blood vessels embed themselves into. Of the muscles that insert themselves into the mesh scaffolding, larger muscles anchor the skin to the bone and control the membrane tension and camber of the bat wing during flight,S. M. Swartz, M. S. Groves, H. D. Kim, and W. R. Walsh. Mechanical properties of bat wing membrane skin. Journal of Zoology,239(2):357‚Äì378, 1996. whereas smaller muscles, which originate from within the mesh scaffolding, attach to collagen fibers within the fiber network and modulate bone loading and allow for precise control of wing shape and tension. As seen in snakes, local structural differences within the arrangement of the fibers change the mechanical properties of local area, but there are general characteristics that describe the mechanical behavior of bat wing skin. Within the mesh scaffolding of bat wing skin, collagen fibers cross bones perpendicular to the long axes of the bones, therefore mechanical properties of bat wing skin oriented perpendicular to the long axes of the bones exhibit a lower stiffness than the skin that is oriented parallel to the long axes of the bodies. Stiffer skin is necessary for bat wing skin oriented in the direction parallel to the long axes of the bones to prevent too much deformation of bat wing skin during flight(with respect to the bone), resulting in the shearing of the bat wing skin off of the bone. Flexible skin is necessary for the direction perpendicular to the long axes of the bones for facilitating the shape changes needed for movement and control during flight. This anisotropy of bat wing skin is also useful as method of storing and releasing elastic energy, particularly during the downstroke. During the downstroke, the bat extends its wing and the wing skin experiences an aerodynamic force. The wing skin expands and counteracts the aerodynamic force. After the wing is fully extended, the orientation of the wing is nearly vertical and the aerodynamic forces on the wing are reduced. As the aerodynamic force is reduced, the wing recoils, drawing the digits of the wings together in preparation for the upstroke. =Gliding lizards= There are two different mechanisms by which lizards glide through the air. Both mechanisms involve the patagia. Active parachuting mechanism In the active mechanism, skeletal supports and muscles run through the patagia of lizards. The skeletal supports and muscle erect the flight membrane and control the gliding using the patagia. Most of the lizards that exhibit this active gliding mechanism are agamine lizards such lizards in the genus Draco. For the passive mechanism of gliding in lizards, the patagia is unfurled by air pressure alone. The patagia of the passive mechanism differs from patagia of the active mechanism; there is the lack of skeleton support and musculature in patagia of the gliding lizards with the passive gliding mechanism . The passive mechanism of gliding is seen in smaller lizards such as the geckos of the genus Ptychozoon. For the passive mechanism of gliding, body movements are believed to control the descent of the gliding lizard.http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8150000/8150333.stm Passive parachuting mechanism The surface area to body ratios of lizards with different gliding mechanisms are similar, but how the surface area is distributed is different. The difference in the distribution of surface area indicates the differences in the role of the patagia and accessory areas for the different flight mechanisms. Lizards with passive gliding mechanisms tend to have smaller patagia relative to lizards with active flight mechanisms. However, lizards with passive flight mechanism have, ore surface area located in accessory areas(i.e. webbed toes, tail) than lizards with the active gliding mechanism.Anthony P. Russell, Luke D. Dijkstra, and G. Lawrence Powell. Structural characteristics of the patagium of Ptychozoon kuhli (Reptilia: Gekkonidae) in relation to parachuting locomotion. Journal of Morphology, 247(3):252‚Äì263, 2001. The structure of the skin of the patagia and accessory areas for the patagia of a Ptychozoon kuhli, flying gecko, exhibiting the passive gliding mechanism consists of five layers; a layer of adipose tissue is surrounded by a layer of dermis on each side (ventral and dorsal) and a layer of epidermis is external to the two dermal layers. The distribution of the adipose tissue IS thickest close to the body wall. This thick layer of adipose tissue at close to the body wall is believed to provide a \\"safety factor\\" for the structural elements of the skin ( i.e. collagen fibers) near the body wall. The thick layer of adipose tissue is more compliant than the structural elements of the body wall (i.e. ribs, muscles), therefore will more readily deform(absorb force) before the structural elements of the skin experience a force. The layer of adipose tissue also aids in the creation of the domed and cambered shape of the patagia. With regards to the structure of the dermal layer of the patagia, there is a thick layer of collagen fibers oriented parallel to the axis of the patagial ribs. These collagen fibers act as the structural support for the shape of the patagia, and provide the stiffness necessary to resist shape chang . The most prominent features of the epidermal layer of the patagia are the scales. The morphology of the dorsal scales of the patagia change as a result of their functional role. A large portion of the dorsal scales of the patagia are arranged in regular rib-like pattern, which guide the flow of air and allow for the lizard to behave as an airfoil. However at the hinge joints (places where patagia folds and attaches to limbs), the regular rib like structure of scales breakdown into a more random distribution of scales. This breakdown of scales is believed to aid in the mechanical loading of the patagia during the unfurling process and also determining the extent the patagia unfurling during flight. =Birds= The wing of a woodpecker Avian skin is a bit more complicated than the skin of gliding lizards or bats because the presence of feathers. In addition to the counteracting stresses and stains associated with flight, avian skin must provide a means to monitor and anchor a \\"coat of feathers\\", thus the structure of avian skin is different from skin of other flying and gliding animals. To better understand the structure of avian skin, avian skin has been broken down into three different functional components: * hydraulic skeleto-muscular apparatus of the feathers This functional component consists of the only of the structural features of the feather tracts, namely the cutis, and connective tissue layer fascia superficialis. This functional component was named \\"hydraulic skeletal\\" due to the fact that the fat bodies embedded within cutis and fascia act similar to the hydrostatic bodies within a hydrostatic skeleton. However the functional role of the fat bodies within the hydraulic skeleto-muscular apparatus of the feathers is to counteract forces generated by the erector and depressor muscle of the feathers tracts. rather than to facilitate movement within of a body. *dermo-subcutaneous muscular system of integument This functional component of avian skin consists of the smooth muscle of the apertia and striated subcutaneous muscles. The smooth muscles of the apertia counteract the horizontal forces experienced by the feather follicles. The striated subcutaneous muscles also adjust the position of the feather follicles in the directions the smooth muscle cannot. Together this system acts as an integrated muscular system that properly positions the feather tracts on the body of the bird. *subcutaneous hydraulic skeletal system This functional component of avian skin consists of the fat bodies of the fascia superficialis and Fascia subcutanea. The majority of the fat bodies are located either between fascia superficialis and the Fascia subcutanea. These fat bodies are stratically located at depression within the body of the bird and function to even out depressions so that feather tracts of the skeleto-muscular apparatus function properly.

Description (description by G.W. Tryon) The height of the shell attains 5 mm. The shell figured differs from Basillisa costulata Watson, 1879 (synonym of Ancistrobasis reticulata (Philippi, 1844) ) in the less flexuous radiating costae, which are nearly equal to the interspaces in width, and in the smaller number of spiral ridges, which are about ten on the base and seven to nine on the upper surface of the whorls. The armature of the aperture is a character which does not appear until full maturity. The other characters seem to agree closely with Watson's figure and description, and, taking into consideration the known variability of the abyssal shells, I do not feel justified in separating the Blake shells specifically from B. costulata. If I am correct in the identification, this material enables me to add a good deal to the knowledge of the species and genus. The dried remains of the animal in one specimen bear a pellucid multispiral operculum a little more circular in outline than that of Seguenzia, but otherwise precisely like it. The aperture in the adult is strongly thickened a little distance within its margin, which remains sharp. The projecting peripheral part is a little bent in, recalling the aperture of Seguenzia. The callus on the body is thin and smooth, that within the outer lip is broad, thick, iridescent, and deeply grooved parallel with the external spirals, producing four or five ridges between the grooves above the carina and a large number of rather smaller ones below it. The columella is thickened concave and strongly reflected. Its basal extreme terminates in a stout tooth- like twist of the margin, beyond which is a deep sulcus in the callus extending nearly across the base, in the middle of which rises a solitary stout tooth-like ridge. The walls of the umbilicus are nearly smooth, and as regards the individual turns are somewhat concave. The protoconch in this form gives the impression, after a very close scrutiny of several fresh specimens, that it is really laid at right angles to the original axis and half immersed in the first post-nuclear turn. This is masked by the fact that the protoconch proper occupies less than a single turn, and appears thus more normal than it really is, if my suspicions are correct.

Description (Original description by Watson) The height of the shell attains 3.5 mm. The small shell has a depressedly conoidal shape that is sharply angulated, flattish on the base, sharply and deeply umbilicated. It is a little porcelaneous, and flexuously ribbed. Sculpture: The whole surface is covered with longitudinal flexuous ribs, which are narrow, sharp, and uniform. Each of these ribs is about 0.05 mm broad. They are parted by intervals which at the suture are twice and at the periphery three times as broad as the ribs. There are about forty of these on the body whorl. They are crossed by spirals, half the breadth of the ribs, running across the intercostal spaces and forming knobs on the ribs. Of these spirals there are about seventeen on the body whorl, much closer set and less uniform than the ribs. In particular the carinal spiral, which is very sharp, and the fourth and seventh above it, are stronger than the others. The last mentioned of these is especially so on the earliest whorls. On the base the longitudinals though continued even into the umbilicus, become much less prominent and are no longer nodose. The spirals, of which there are about fifteen, are closer set, broader and flatter, except the first three below the carina, which are sharp and narrow. The whole base of the shell is pit-marked from the spiral interstitial furrows being cut up by the longitudinals. The color of the shell is dead white (on the base a little glossy) on the thin porcelaneous surface, through which ihe nacreous layer behind gleams. The spire is raised, with a very slightly concave outline. The apex, which consists of the minute smooth embryonic whorl and a half, is itself a little flattened, but rises sharply above the sculptured surface of the succeeding whorls. The 5¬Ω whorls show a slow and regular increase till the last, which begins to enlarge rapidly. They are slightly rounded above, very sharply angulated at the keel, and flattened on the base, with a bluntly angulated umbilical edge. The suture is distinct, and slightly impressed. The square aperture is perpendicular. The sharp outer lip is thickened by a slight internal remote callus, not patulous, not descending, advancing at its junction with the body whorl and then slightly retreating so as to form the very shallow open sinus. It is right-angled at the periphery, flat on the base, where it retreats so as to form two rounded sinuses, making with the columella an angle that is scarcely obtuse. The columellar lip is straight, a little thickened and reverted, so as to leave a slight groove behind it. It advances on the body whorl, then retreats so as to form a feeble sinus, bending at the same time shortly but sharply to the right into the umbilicus and then advancing straight forward, but a little toward the left, to its junction with the outer lip at the base. The funnel-shaped umbilicus is open- mouthed, oblique edged, straight-sided, deep and contracted internally. Its edge is sharply defined by a spiral thread, and is obliquely scored by the longitudinal ribs. Farther in, its walls are marked by hair-like lines of growth and faint spirals.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Distribution This species occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, off Brazil and in European waters.

The shell is broadly conical, flat on the base, and sharply angulated. It is small, thin, delicate, smooth, glossy, and nacreous under a thin white calcareous surface. Sculpture: There are longitudinals, which are very faint but still sharp, sinuated, showing the old lines of growth. There are over the whole surface very faint traces of spirals. At the bottom of each whorl, about 0.25 mm. above the suture, is a sharp narrow thread, which on the body whorl is bordered below by a second, rather higher and sharper, which forms the carina, and which on the spire is buried by the overlap of the succeeding whorl. On the base of the shell there are about eleven fine spirals, within which is a strong furrow, and a projecting, crenulated, or ropelike thread forming the edge of the umbilicus. The colour of the shell is opalescent, from the underlying nacre shining through the polished, thin, translucent calcareous layer of the surface. The spire is high and conical. The apex is flattened, with the minute smooth embryonic 1¬Ω whorl slightly projecting. The 6 whorls show a regular and slow increase (but the specimen is not full-grown).

Leeds plays guitar and sings in the band Joanie Leeds and the Nightlights. Biography Growing up in Miami, Florida (legal name Joan Leibowitz) in a Jewish family, Leeds took voice lessons as a child and was involved in school choirs and musical theater performances throughout her high school years. She taught herself how to play guitar and began song-leading at her summer camp and youth group conventions. As a musical theater and drama major at Syracuse University, she began writing her own original music and recorded her first album her senior year of college. After graduating, she began writing and recording children's music and began working as a children's music specialist at preschools in New York City. In 2000, she recorded her first full-length CD, My Job Application Knows More about Me That You Do, while finishing her senior year of Syracuse. After graduating, she moved to New York City and took a bartending job at the Greenwich Village music club, The Bitter End, and sang with her band as a professional rock musician. She started her own record label, Limbostar, along with her own publishing company through BMI, Zameret Music. For 7 years, Leeds sang in clubs such as The Living Room, CBGB's Gallery, Arlene's Grocery, The Bitter End and many others. In 2003 she recorded Soul From My Footsteps produced by Richard Oliver Furch at Tribase Productions and Chris Benelli. \\"Joanie tried her hand at about ten different day gigs (Real Estate Agent, Miramax Films Casting Assistant, Epic Records PR assistant) until a friend suggested that she get a job where she could sing with kids during the day and perhaps sleep at night. You could say that Joanie found (as in 'discovered') herself, managing one of the Manhattan Gymboree Play & Music locations and singing with and for kids all day long. The nocturnal club scene was fun, but making music with children was real fun\\". In 2006, she began working and singing at Gymboree Play & Music and managed the Upper West Side location. Inspired by the children in her classes, she began writing music for kids and shortly after left Gymboree to start her own birthday party business singing her original songs. With some of her musician friends, Harris Cohen, Brad Levy, Ben Whetsel, Ben Elkin and producer/mixer/engineer Kelly E. Harnett, she put out her first children's album, City Kid, which won a Parents' Choice Award.http://www.parents- choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=24956&award;=xx&from;=Joanie%20Leeds%20Music%20for%20Kids The album contained original songs like \\"Sushi\\" and \\"Blast Off\\", along with covers of \\"Our House\\" and Otis Redding's \\"Happy Song\\". \\"2009 was a banner year for Joanie Leeds, with gigs in NYC, Los Angeles, Miami, Baltimore, The Hamptons, Memphis, Nashville, Asheville (NC), Cleveland (GA), and Washington, DC. Joanie was a guest on radio shows in Miami and Nashville and appeared on Good Morning Maryland (WMAR/ABC-TV, Baltimore). Her songs have been spinning regularly on The Saturday Morning Cereal Bowl and other kindie rock radio programs and podcasts, and she released two music videos to YouTube\\". She also co-wrote a Jewgrass (Jewish Bluegrass) album with friend and banjo player Matthew Check and released Challah, Challah in September 2009. In 2010, Leeds released a full length DVD, City Kid Live directed by Miami-based Emmy Award- winning editor and director, AJ Nichols. It includes 3 music videos, a live concert and bonus features. Also released in 2010 is her second album, I'm a Rock Star,http://newyorkkids.timeout.com/articles/music/83892/im-a-rock-star- by-joanie-leeds-and-the-nightlights-music-review which features the Saturday Night Live inspired parody \\"More Cowbell\\" and the environmentally friendly, \\"I Wanna Be Green\\". I'm A Rock Star was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee in the summer of 2009 with Zodlounge Music, a music production company. The title track was awarded a finalist position in The John Lennon Songwriting Contest and she was awarded an Independent Music Award for best children's song. Following the success of I'm a Rock Star, Leeds quickly released What a Zoo, an animal themed CD which stand out tracks such as \\"Happy As a Clam\\" and \\"Tofurky\\" became frequently played on the radio stations such as XM/Sirius Satellite. \\"Tofurky\\" was also used by the Tofurky company as their official theme song for the Thanksgiving holiday. Another Parent's Choice award and a NAPPA Gold Award (National Parenting Publications Award) were given for songs from this album. \\"Happy As a Clam\\" was a finalist in the International Songwriting Competition and People and Parents magazines both listed What a Zoo as their top children's CD of 2011. Joanie's next album, Bandwagon was released in June 2013. In 2014, Leeds released Good Egg and in 2015 Leeds gave birth to a baby daughter along with releasing an album of Jewish themed songs, Meshugana, and a DVD titled Joanie Leeds & The Nightlights- Live from Madison Square Park. In 2017 Leeds released her 8th album for children, Brooklyn Baby! and in the same year coincidentally, she moved out of Brooklyn and back to Manhattan upon separating from her husband. In 2018, Leeds started a new musical project with her Challah, Challah co-writer, Matthew Check, titled Joanie and Matt The songwriting duo team up this time to write and record a Folksy-Americana album interpreting ancient texts with a modern and feminist twist. They funded their debut album on Kickstarter and it was released in December, 2018. Joanie's 9th children's album, All the Ladies, was released to critical acclaim on April 3rd 2020. Lucy Kalantari produced the all-female concept album which featured Joanie's original songs about female empowerment and gender equality. Songs include RBG, a song about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the title track, All the Ladies, which is sung by Joanie and Lisa Loeb. Leeds tour at national venues across the country such as Lollapalooza, Clearwater Festival, The Kennedy Center, Lincoln Center, The Levitt Pavilion, Wolf Trap, Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, Skirball Cultural Center and Symphony Space and her music is often played on radio stations such as Sirius XM and WXPN.

Description The shell grows to a length of 7.6 mm. The high shell has a broadly conical shape. The color of the shell is pure white when weathered, but apparently slightly brownish when fresh, with a pearly nacre below the thin calcareous surface layer. The shell has a very large umbilicus. It is carinated and ornamented with rows of tubercles. There is a row of small round pointed tubercles a little below the suture. The carina is double, formed by two rather remote tubercled threads, the lower of which runs to the outer lip. Below this one is a broadish furrow and slightly beaded thread, which toward the mouth projects so as to become a third carina. The center of the base has another slightly beaded thread. There is another formed of remote rounded tubercles, defining the umbilicus, within which is a very slight furrow and an ill-defined ridge. The apical whorls are ribbed, but the ribs gradually break into the scarcely connected tubercles of the body whorl. The lines of growth are hardly perceptible, except on the base. The spire is high and very slightly scalar. The sharp apex is minute, flattened on the one side, with the very small embryonic 1¬º whorl rising sharply on the other. The spire contains 7 whorls, that increase in size regularly. The body whorl is small, from the large part of it cut out by the umbilicus. The whorls are flatly conical and slightly scalar. The suture is linear, but strongly defined by the right-angled junction of the whorl. The oblique aperture is much inclined to the axial line, and rectangularly rounded. The columella and outer lip are parallel. The outer lip is thin and broken, not descending. The inner lip is shortly but flatly bent over the umbilicus, and here it is patulous and sinuated, it then advances in a straight line toward the base. It is toothed in the middle by a strongish spiral protuberance at which point it projects. But from this to the junction with the base it is thin and retreats. The umbilicus is very large, funnel-shaped and pervious.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Solariella aeglees) Distribution This species is occurs in the Gulf of Mexico and off Puerto Rico References * Rosenberg, G., F.

Description The length of the shell reaches 11 mm. The shell has a depressedly conoidal shape. It is sharply keeled, with a flat base and large umbilicus. It is nacreous under a thin, transparent, yellowish-white layer. The 5¬Ω whorls are slightly convex, especially the body whorl. The nucleus is smooth and shining. The sculpture consists on the upper whorls of rather distant, radiating ribs, crossed about halfway by a spiral rib or keel, forming small, sharp tubercles where they cross each other. On the third whorl, another series of tubercles appears, at some distance from the deep suture. On the penultimate whorl, the number of rows of tubercles amounts to three and the suture is conspicuously crenulated by the keel, which rests on the body whorl. This whorl is adorned by 5 spiral rows of tubercles, of which the second from above is the smallest. Moreover, the keel is surmounted by short, conical, rather sharp spines of which 38 are visible, if seen from below. The base of the shell is nearly flat, more convex towards the aperture, with 7 spiral rows of beads on rounded lirae, and a row of stronger ones, bordering the umbilicus. Moreover, the whole body whorl is covered with irregular radiating wrinkles or riblets, instead of the regular ribs on the upper whorls. These ribs are especially conspicuous and more regular on the base, except towards the periphery where they form thinner, irregular wrinkles. The umbilicus is pervious, funnel-shaped. Its walls has strong wrinkles. The aperture is rhombic. Its upper margin is regularly convex, not very thin, and thickened interiorly. It is separated from the basal margin by a groove, corresponding to the keel. The basal margin is convex, crenulated, thickened interiorly. The columellar margin is rather thick, concave in its upper part, and terminating in a sort of tooth below. The parietal wall is covered by a thick layer of enamel, thickened at its margin and connected to the columella by a broad, rounded tongue-shaped projection, covering part of the umbilicus, whose largest diameter, from the base of the columella to the opposite side, is about 2/5 of the diameter of the shell. The thin operculumis horny, many-whorled, and concave at the outer side. The radula has the teeth in about 48 rows. The rhachidian tooth (R) has a rounded body, with crooked hooks at the angles of the very concave posterior margin, and is thickened by a plate of a triangular shape, with concave sides. The cusp is considerably narrower than the body, which is large in front. It has a sharp point and a few small denticles on each side; the body of the first lateral tooth is larger, subquadrate, with a sharply pointed cusp and a few smaller denticles The second one has a similar, but more elongated shape and a sharper cusp, also with a few smaller denticles. The third lateral is long and slender, strongly hooked, with denticles at the base of the cusp, and resembles more the uncini. Of the uncini the outer ones have a toothed margin, the outermost is broader with many small denticles.Schepman 1908-1913, The Prosobranchia of the Siboga Expedition; Leyden,E. J.

Description The size of the shell varies between 20 mm and 27 mm. Sculpture, spirals: a flat shoulder below the suture is followed by an angulation, on and below there is a double row of smallish, round but pointed tubercles. These are remote from one another but run in pairs on the two rows. The tubercles in each row are connected by a slight rounded thread. On the second, third and fourth whorls these rows coalesce into one. On the body whorl they are slightly apart. At the periphery is a strong angulation bearing a sharp carina. Just above this is a spiral thread, which, as well as the carina, is ornamented with delicate, sharp, laterally compressed beads separated from one another by about twice their own size. Those on the upper spiral are rather the larger. The middle of the whorl for about 0.25 cm is bare. On the base there are five closely beaded threads, of which the inmost and strongest defines the umbilicus. Between the outermost and the carina is a broad slightly sunken furrow. The carina meets the outer lip and appears above the suture. Longitudinals: The upper whorls are ribbed, but the ribbing gradually breaks into the double row of paired tubercles, and the link uniting the pairs in the two rows becomes very feeble. There are besides many distant, irregular, loose, skin-like puckerings which follow the lines of growth. They disappear on the spiral threads. The whole surface is further roughened by microscopic flexuous wrinklings. The color of the shell is yellowish white on the thin calcareous layer overlying the nacre. The high spire is a little scalar. The apex is small and sharp. The eight whorls increase regularly in size. They are a little rounded, angulated at the carina, rather tumid on the base, and have a wide umbilicus. The suture is angulated and well defined, but a little filled up by the carina of the overlying whorl. The aperture is (apparently) perpendicular and semioval. The outer lip is well rounded. The columellar lip is a little bent over on the umbilicus, and then advancing rather straight toward the left. it is angulated and slightly toothed at the point of the base when the umbilical beaded thread joins it. The umbilicus has a wide deep funnel, with a deep spiral staircase at the junction of the whorls.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Gibbula glyptus) Distribution This marine species occurs off Queensland and New South Wales, Australia; also off Vanuatu.

Description (Original description by Watson) The shell size varies between 6 mm and 18 mm. The shell has a conical shape with a tumid base. It is carinated and umbilicated. It is thin, translucent and pearly. Sculpture: There are two spirals, on the upper whorls, on the body whorl 7‚Äì8,. These are pretty strong, but fine beaded threads. The first lies remote below the suture, and is sparsely ornamented by longitudinally produced, high and pointed, tubercles. It forms a shoulder on the whorl. The second projects strongly and sharply at the periphery and forms the carina. It and those below are delicately fretted with close-set small beads. The third, which meets the outer lip, lies within the contraction of the base. The last two are closer than the rest, which, however, are sometimes brought closer by the additional thread which appears among them. The oe which defines the umbilicus is more sharply beaded than the rest. Longitudinals: Below the suture and near the umbilicus the surface is sharply but delicately puckered, and these puckerings, strong in the early whorls, are in the later faintly continued across the whorls as lines of growth. The colour of the shell is yellowish white, with a brilliant nacreous sheen shining through the thin superficial calcareous layer, which becomes more opaque in drying. The high spire is scalar. The apex is minute, flattened, with the minute bulbous embryonic 1¬º whorl projecting on one side. The 8 whorls increase rapidly in size. They are rounded, but angulated by the projection of the spirals, very tumid on the base. The suture is linear, but strongly defined by the contraction of the suprajacent whorl and the flat shoulder of the one below. The round aperture is very slightly oblique, but on the pillar flattened, and at the point of it angulated slightly. It is nacreous within. Across the body there is no pad, but the shell is eroded, which looks like a thin callus. The outer lip is thin, not descending. The columellar lip is slightly patulous, bending flatly over the umbilicus, and then advancing in a straight line to the point of the columella, where it is slightly angulated just where the beaded umbilical spiral ends. The umbilicus is funnel-shaped, rather open, but a good deal contracted within, sharply scored with the lines of growth. The operculum is yellow, horny, very thin, consists of 7 to 8 whorls. The animal has a uniform light colour. The foot is broad, and bluntly pointed behind. There are 5, probably 6, large appendages, between which the membrane above them is edged with many small ones.

Description (Original description by Schepman) The shell reaches a length of 8 mm. The yellowish-white, conical shell is moderately depressed and slightly convex below. It has a very strong, rounded keel, and is widely umbilicate. The spire consists of whorls. The nucleus is smooth. The upper whorls contain concentric ribs and traces of one or two spiral lirae, producing small tubercles on the ribs. The whorls are flattened near the suture. Above the upper row of tubercles, this depression is roughened by small lamellae. The lower part of the whorls is slightly convex. On the lower whorls, the sculpture consists of a row of rather strong tubercles at some distance from the suture, the flattened space between suture and tubercles is also lamelliferous. A second row of smaller tubercles makes its appearance, and becomes more conspicuous on the body whorl. At some distance from the lower suture, a spiral rib, with inconspicuous beads, is crossed by irregular, waved lamellae, which spread on the large keel. This keel is flat above, rounded at its periphery, and adorned by sharp, compressed folds, which make it crenulated. The base of the shell is sculptured by five beaded spirals, of which the outer one, placed at some distance from the margin, and the most central one, bordering the umbilicus are double. The whole base is covered by radiating very oblique riblets. The funnel-shaped umbilicus is pervious. It has two spiral lirae, of which the lower one is beaded, and radiating riblike striae. Its largest diameter is about of the base. The aperture is rhombic. The convex, outer margin is rather thin, internally lirate, with short folds between the lirae. The convex basal margin is short, and internally with a few lirae. The broad columella is concave, with a conspicuous fold near the base and a small denticle above it. Its upper part is connected to the outer margin by a conspicuous layer of enamel, with thickened margin, and a free ear-shaped projection, covering part of the umbilicus.Schepman M.M.

Description The shell grows to a length of 6.3 mm. The shell has a conical shape. It consists of 6¬Ω whorls, which glisten with that peculiar spun-glass or flossy luster noticeable in so many abyssal species. The sculpture consists of two lines closely appressed to the sutures, less prominent and less conspicuously provided with the angular projections than in Calliotropis vaillanti (P. Fischer, 1882). Between the upper and lower lines the surface of the whorl is smooth, except for lines of growth, shining as above described, and seems even a little concave. The nodules on the upper carina of one whorl fit into the spaces between the nodules on the lower carina of the preceding whorl, and thus alternate along the line of the suture and give it a wavy character. The carina on the body whorl is seen to be formed by two threads, which constitute the periphery, with fainter angularities than the others. The base of the shell is somewhat inflated, with two sharp, smooth threads between the periphery and the nodulate boundary of the small funnel-shaped umbilicus. The lines of growth are much as in Calliotropis vaillanti. The umbilicus is not infringed upon by any reflection of the columellar lip, and the aperture is about as wide as high, and less distinctly rectangular.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Trochus (Solariella) lissocona) Distribution This species is distributed in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico References * Rosenberg, G., F.

Description (Original description) A brilliantly nacreous species, ornamented with two spiral rows of conical tubercles and four smooth carinae on the base, exclusive of a faintly granulated one which bounds the umbilicus. The glistening metallic lustre of the whole exterior is largely though not entirely due to the erosion of the delicate external layer of the shell. In the Siboga-specimens the whole shell, perhaps with exception of the embryonic whorls, is covered by a thin yellowish layer, having the aspect of an epidermis, and only when this is removed, the metallic lustre appears. The basal carinae, if not eroded, are not smooth, in the majority of the specimens. There are only three of them, and a trace of an intermediate one near the aperture, the most central keel is decidedly adorned with small tubercles and also the other ones are slightly beaded or crenulated. The outer layer of the shell has a fibrous texture, in the interstices between the umbilical keel and the second basal keel, the surface has distinct riblike striae.

Description (Original description by Schepman) The shell grows to a height of 4¬æ mm. The yellowish-white shell has a conical shape with a rounded but keeled periphery and a convex base. It is umbilicate. The 6 whorls are convex. The nucleus is wanting. The sculpture consists on the upper two whorls, of nearly simple concentric ribs. On the next two, the ribs are crossed by two spiral lirae, producing short tubercles on the ribs, where they cross them. The last two whorls have plicae near the channelled suture, with a row of tubercles, bordering on the infrasutural sulcus. Another similar row, a little lower on the concentric ribs and a third, consists of compressed tubercles, (about 30 on the last whorl) near the base of the whorls. These tubercles, especially those of the peripheral row, are connected by spiral lirae, of which the lowest represents the keel. The convex base is sculptured by four spiral cords, of which that near the keel, bears strong, compressed tubercles. Those of the more central cord are smaller, and the innermost two are strongly beaded, the inner one borders the umbilicus. Moreover, the base is sculptured by irregular, radiating riblets and like the upper part, by microscopic striae.

Description The size of the shell varies between 6 mm and 18 mm (1/4 to 3/4-inch). The thin and delicate shell is rather large for the genus; it is whitish, brilliantly iridescent or pearly, externally and internally. It has a broad, conical shape. It is turreted, wider than it is high, with a convex base, and deep umbilicus. The seven whorls are much flattened, with the suture scarcely impressed. The upper whorls are coronated by two, and the bodywhorl by three, revolving, strongly nodulous ribs, along which the conical, often acute nodules are very regularly arranged. The first of these rows of nodules is just below the suture. The second is separated from the first by a wide, flat, or slightly concave interspace. The third is not far from the second, and surrounds the periphery, usually corresponding with the line of the suture. The second and third are usually the most elevated. On the base of the shell there are five or six strong, rounded, revolving ribs, part of them usually somewhat nodulous, separated by deep, concave interspaces, rather wider than he rib; one or two additional ones often appear in the umbilical opening, which is funnel-shaped and moderately large, but often partially obstructed by the reflected (turned outwards) edge of the inner lip. The interspaces between all the ribs are covered with close, slightly raised lines of growth, and usually with traces of a thin epidermis. The large aperture is somewhat quadrangular. The lip is thin. The animal has long tentacles and large black eyes. There are four large lateral cirri on each side, with a group of four or five small intermediate ones. The snout has a broad, bilobed, crescent-shaped expansion in front. The odontophore has no large lateral tooth between the inner and outer series.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Solariella ottoi) Distribution This species occurs in European waters and in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.

Description (Original description by Schepman) The shell grows to a height of 14¬Ω mm. The shell has a conical shape, with convex base. It is nacreous, covered by a very thin, transparent layer of yellowish shelly matter. The largest specimen has 8 whorls. The nucleus is white, smooth, occupying about one whorl. The next 3 whorls are straight on their upper part. They are separated from the lower part of each whorl by a sharp keel, and crossed by rather distant radiating ribs, which form sharp tubercles in crossing the keel, and on the third whorl also near the suture. These ribs become obsolete, and disappear on the last whorls, which are smooth on their upper surface. This surface is only very slightly convex, with a spiral row of spinous nodules, at a little distance from the canaliculate suture, and a strong keel at the periphery Below this keel the whorls are excavated, so as to form with the channel of the next whorl, a rather wide, deep channel, over which the keel projects, producing the pagodiform shape. Of the spinous nodules, the largest specimen has 25 at the keel, and about 30 near the suture. The base is rather convex, with a small umbilicus, bordered by a rather strong, crenulated, spiral rib Between this and the peripheral keel run 4 spiral lirae, which are more or less beaded. The outer one nearest to the keel, borders the concave inferior space of the upper whorls, and on this spiral runs the suture, which is slightly crenulate. The aperture is subquadrangular, with the outer and basal margins sharp, irregular by the ends of the spirals The columella is nearly straight, with a distinct angle where it joins the basal margin. This angle is caused by the umbilical rib, its upper part is slightly reflected over the umbilicus and covers it partly. The umbilicus is somewhat roughened by the lines of growth. The whole shell is covered with irregular, interrupted, hairlike lines of growth, visible only under a lens. The interior of the aperture is smooth.Schepman 1908‚Äì1913, The Prosobranchia of the Siboga Expedition; Leyden, E. J.

Description (Original description by Schepman) The length of the shell is 12 mm. The yellowish-white shell has a depressedly conoidal shape with a nearly flat base. It is sharply keeled with a large umbilicus . The six whorls are slightly convex. The nucleus is smooth. The upper whorls have concentric ribs. On the third whorl they are pointed above, at some distance from the suture, and near the base of this whorl, appears a row of tubercles on a spiral rib. The subsequent whorls are slightly concave or canaliculated near the suture. The fourth whorl is sculptured by concentric ribs, with stronger tubercles at the top. Near that depression; on the fifth whorl, the sculpture consists of a row of tubercles and 3 beaded lirae, of which the third, near the keel is the strongest. This keel is compressedly crenulate. The space between suture and tubercles has short, irregular folds. The same sculpture persists on the body whorl, where the tubercles, about 30 in number, are compressed and show a tendency to become double. The crenules of the keel are slightly concave from above to below. The base of the shell is nearly flat with 5 concentric beaded lirae. The beads bordering the umbilicus are the largest. The whole base is covered with rather regular, riblike striae and very fine microscopic ones, visible also on the upper part of the shell. The large umbilicus occupies from the base of the columella to the opposite side, about 2/5 of the diameter of the shell It is funnel-shaped, and pervious. Its wall is spirally striate, with a single, spiral, beaded rib and radiating plicae. The thin aperture is rhombic, probably not quite developed. Its upper margin is convex, the basal one nearly straight. The columellar marginis slightly convex, reflected above. The parietal wall has a thin layer of enamel.Schepman 1908‚Äì1913, The Prosobranchia of the Siboga Expedition; Leyden,E. J.

Description The shell grows to a length of 10 mm. The shell has a conical shape, with a broad and tumid base and a wide narrowed umbilicus. The surface is cross-hatched like a file. When fresh, the shell is translucent with a pearly sheen. Spirals: There are three to five slightly raised remotely beaded threads, of which one lies a little below the suture and one at the periphery forming a carina, of which the beads are much smaller and closer set, sometimes evanescent. Another one with beads like the first, defines the umbilicus. Within the umbilicus there is a strong spiral ridge. The whole surface is covered with fine rather sharp threads, whose partings are twice as broad as themselves. Of these finer spirals, the one which meets the outer lip often rises into prominence and defines the base, while another above the carina sometimes stands out more strongly and more beaded than the rest. Longitudinals: The whole surface is close-set with these, which are crossed by the spirals, than which they are broader but less sharp, closer- set, and more irregular and interrupted, especially near the upper line of tubercles and near the umbilicus. The color of the shell is a bluish white when alive, with a translucent calcareous layer through which the nacre shines. The high spire is a little scalar. The small apex is a little flattened, with the embryonic 1¬º whorl barely projecting in the middle. The spire contains 6‚Äì7 whorls, the last is of rapid increase, full rounded and a little tumid. The preceding ones are a little roundedly shouldered below the suture, flat on the contour, angulated at the carina, and slightly contracted into the suture. The apical whorls are simply rounded and longitudinally ribbed. The suture is linear, but strongly, not acutely defined by the perpendicular rise of the whorl above it and the slight sloping shoulder below. The aperture is round, scarcely oblique, with a translucent porcelaneous edge, and pearly within. The sharp outer lip is not descending. Its inner edge is beveled outwards at the expense of the pearly layer. The columellar lip bends over the umbilicus. It is a little reverted, and expands into a tooth at the intra-umbilical ridge. The funnel-shaped umbilicus is, wide and pervious, but narrowed within by the spiral ridge. The operculum consists of very many narrow whorls, which on their outer edge overlap as a narrow gleaming flange.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Solariella aeglees var. rhina) Distribution This species occurs in the upper bathyal zone of the Gulf of Mexico and in the Atlantic Ocean off the Azores References * Rosenberg, G., F.

Description The size of the shell varies between 2.7 mm and 4.4 mm. The shell thin, transparent, glossy, but not nacreous forms a depressed cone. Its color is glassy. The shell is umbilicated and rather smooth. The sculpture of the shell shows a single, sharp keel round the periphery, showing at the base of the spire-whorls. The shell has a thread- like spiral rib below the rather deep suture of each whorl (varying in position), numerous but slight flexuous striae below the rib, and in some specimens minute close-set curved longitudinal striae on the upper whorls. The base is nearly smooth or marked only with microscopic lines of growth. The seven whorls of the short spire are compressed, slightly shouldered by the infrasutural rib. The body whorl is disproportionally large, and the first is globular. The narrow aperture is rhomboidal, angulated in the middle by the keel, and below by the base of the columella. The outer lip is thin. The inner lip filmy and spread on the base. The columella is very short and incurved. It is furnished near the bottom with a small tooth-like process, below which is a short notch. The groove is broad, apparently not deep. It occupies the middle of the body whorl between the suture and the peripheral keel. The umbilicus is narrow but deep, exposing all the whorls, encircled and defined by a slight rib.

Description (Original description by Watson) The size of the shell varies between 3 mm and 4.8 mm. The thin, smooth, umbilicate shell is small. It has a high spire with a conical shape. It is scalar with three rows of tubercled lirations. Sculpture. There is a sharp circumbasal carina. Above this is a broad shallow furrow. About one third up the whorl is a narrow and blunt liration. A little more remote is a third, separated by a narrow, horizontal, flat surface from the suture. All these three lirations are orname ted with little tubercles or blunt spines, which are strongest on the highest thread, and there number about twenty-five on the body whorl, on the second thread there are about twenty-eight. The base, which is rather flatly arched, has round the outside a flat surface hardly deep enough to be called a furrow, defined on the inner side by a clear narrow line, within which the curve of the base rises a little and has some faint spirals. The edge of the umbilicus is sharply defined by a fine line, outside of which is a broad shallow furrow bordered externally by a slight spiral. There is another narrower furrow, the outer side of which is the most projecting part of the base, but beyond this is rather flat and has some obsolete spirals. On the upper whorls the spirals are feeble and without tubercles, which only appear distinctly on the fourth whorl. Longitudinals: The flexuous lines of growth are very faint. The colour of the shell is porcellanous when young and fresh, but weathering to a chalky white, with a pearly nacre below the thin surface and within the mouth, especially at the outer upper corner. The high spire is conical and scalar. The apex is very small and sharp, flattened on the one side, and with the minute 1¬º embryonic whorl projecting tumidly on the other. The 7¬Ω whorls show a gradual increase. The upper ones are rounded. The later whorls are flat below the suture, then angulated, then flat on the conical slope of the spire, and then very slightly constricted above the carina, very slightly rounded on the base, with a flat and slightly impressed, but sloping border round the outside, sharply angulated at the umbilicus. The suture is linear, but strongly defined by the constriction and impressed angulation of the shell at that point. The aperture is perpendicular, nearly square. The outer lip sharp and thin, not patulous, not descending. The curves are very faintly indicated by the lines of growth, but are similar to those described in Seguenzia formosa Jeffreys, 1876, there being three sinuses, one near the suture between the first and second spinose thread, a second, very small but sharp, at the carina, and a third toward the exterior of the base. The columellar lip is patulous and reverted, with a furrow behind it, twisted, with a broad deep sinus above. A strong twisted tooth projects at about two- thirds of its length, below which is a smaller sinus running out into a point at the extreme end of the columella. This point corresponds to the umbilical carina. The umbilicus is more open than large, perpendicular and deep, being only slightly narrowed by the reverted coluimellar lip and by the corresponding ridge which twines spirally round the columellar wall. Below this ridge is a very strongly marked furrow, which corresponds to the columellar tooth. This species most resembles Carenzia carinata (Jeffreys, 1877), but is narrower, sharper, and the body whorl is larger. The suture is angulately impressed instead of being faintly linear. The spiral threads are stronger, and are picked out with tubercles. The base is more equably curved, the spirals on it are stronger. The umbilicus is smaller, and is more strongly defined, not only by the stronger carina, but by the extracarinal furrow. The columellar tooth comes in higher up than in that species. Watson R. B.

Description The height of the shell attains 11 mm. The thin and slightly nacreous, imperforate shell has an ovate shape. The shell contains seven whorls, the first wound horizontally, thus giving the spire a decapitated aspect. The median whorls are separated by a channeled suture, flattened on the shoulder and subangled at the periphery, the last slightly descending behind the aperture. Colour : Pale yellowish beige with scattered irregular dashes of ochre alternate chocolate dots on the outer lip. Sculpture : The body whorl carries eleven widely spaced fine spiral cords, the peripheral strongest. Of these six appear on the penultimate and fade gradually away on the upper whorls. Both cords and interspaces are crossed by delicate oblique lamellae which rise into scales upon the cords. They are crowded on the last whorl, do not cross the suture from whorl to whorl, and become fewer and fainter ascending the spire. The initial whorl is smooth. The aperture is very oblique and subcircular. The outer lip is effuse, fimbriated by the termination of the spiral sculpture. The inner lip projects over the umbilical region, thence spread from the axis to the right insertion as a solid sheet. The columella is spirally ascending within, terminating below in a downwardly directed tubercle, succeeded by a deep notch and an answering ridge. Thence along the edge of the gullet underneath the external varix are about a score of callus rays, alternately long and short, leading to the throat. Behind the aperture, about a millimetre from the free edge, is a sharp, narrow varix rising gradually at the base and ending abruptly at the suture. Hedley C.

Taxonomy Monterosato (1914) figured the holotype from Calcara's collection and distinguished as separate species the fossil Danilia otaviana (Cantraine, 1835) and the two Recent Danilia tinei and Danilia horrida (Costa, 1861) = costellata (Costa, 1861), followed in this by Palazzi & Villari (2001). The fossil species is quite convincingly distinguished by a globose shape and much finer sculpture in which the spiral elements clearly dominate. The holotype of D. tinei is also globose but has a coarse sculpture with nodose cords, whereas the common form (including that on photographs herein) should go to Danilia costellata if two species are really to be separated. This is a topic that requires further research. Description The size of the shell varies between 7 mm and 10 mm. The imperforate, solid, light brown shell has a conoidal shape with a rounded body whorl and base. Its elevated spire contains 6‚Äì7 convex whorls, separated by deep sutures. The first whorl is planorboid and smooth. The next one is lightly rib-striate. The remainder whorls are clathrate, encircled bv strong spiral lirae, crossed by elevated, lamellar, regular, vertical striae. There are 3 or 4 spirals on the penultimate whorl, 9 on the body whorl. The body whorl is rounded, with a strong, prominent varix behind the outer lip. The aperture is rounded, thickened within and a little expanded, a trifle iridescent.

The species was named after dr. Max Weber, the Dutch leader of the Siboga Expedition. Description (Original description by Schepman) The height of the shell attains 16 mm. The imperforate, thin, shell has a globose-conoidal shape. The spire is more or less elevated. The embryonic whorls are wanting. The remaining whorls number about 6,. They are very convex, especially the penultimate and ultimate ones, the upper whorls forming a cone. The colour of the shell is slightly variable, the ground colour is light yellowish-brown, nearly plain or with darker flames and blotches, which are always present on the varix. The majority of the specimens has two or three series of darker spots on the upper whorls and two specimens have a row of large blackish patches near the suture of the body whorl. The shell is covered with a large number of spiral lirae, often with intermediate ones, the number of lirae being about 7 on the penultimate whorl, but amount with the intermediate ones to 15 or 16. They are crossed by numerous riblike striae, producing short spines on the points of intersection, and very fine lines of growth. On the upper whorls the lirae diminish in number, they become nearly obsolete on the uppermore whorls, and disappear at last, leaving only the concentric ribs. The suture is deep, especially between the penultimate and ultimate whorls, on this last the suture descends conspicuously. The periphery of body whorl is rounded, only apparently keeled by the strong peripheral lira. The base of the shell is ornamented by about 12 beaded lirae, with ribbed interstices. The oblique aperture is rounded-ovate, with a very thin, slightly expanded outer and basal margin, encircled by a strong, compressed, external varix. The margin is thickened interiorly by a rather strong crenulated rib at some distance from the outer rim. The parietal wall is covered by a much expanded, smooth layer, loosened from the body whorl near the place of the wanting umbilicus. The columella is very strong and tortuous, thickened above, then slightly attenuated, with a strong square tooth, from which a tortuous rib runs to the left, enclosing a triangular pit and forming a deep sinus between the columella and basal margin. The interior of the aperture is very iridescent, but covered in part in the adult shells, by the porcellaneous internal rib.Schepman 1908‚Äì1913, The Prosobranchia of the Siboga Expedition; Leyden,E.

It is covered with sharp prickles. Sculpture. Spirals: There are several small threads, two of which, of equal strength and prominence, angulate the whorls‚Äîone at the basal contraction, the other about halfway up the whorl; On the base they are somewhat closer set. The outer lip does not meet the carinal thread, but the one below. Longitudinals: The whole surface is crossed by close-set, slightly oblique narrow laminae, which, in crossing the spirals, rise into sharp vaulted prickles whose faces are turned towards the mouth. Colour : white, with a pearly lustre. The spire is very high. The apex is minute, with the small embryonic 1¬º whorl rising from a minute flat. The shell contains 6¬º whorls, angulated and narrow in the spire, but the body whorl is inflated and expanded. The suture is deeply impressed, somewhat depressed, and very strongly defined. The perpendicular aperture is round, slightly pointed on the base, and angulated at the upper carina. The outer lip is sharp, advancing far across the body towards the columellar lip. The columellar lip is depressed upon the umbilicus, then rounded and sinuated, slightly toothed at the point of the pillar. The umbilicus is wide and deep, but internally narrowed. The peculiarly high narrow spire and the vaulted prickles are very characteristic features of this species.

Description (Original description by Watson) The height of the shell attains 8.2 mm. The small shell has an equilateral conical shape. It is flat-based, and sharply angulated. It is delicately sculptured, and nacreous under a thin, white calcareous surface. Sculpture : there are about 45 longitudinals. These are hair-like, strongly sinuated, flexuous, for they advance markedly at the periphery, where they are each ornamented by an elongated curved tubercle, and on the base they again retreat so as to form a sinus. On the earlier whorls these longitudinals are much more distinct than on the later, and each starts from a little bead, which lie close to the suture, but these beads are very feeble on the body whorl. In the intervals of the longitudinals and parallel to them are very faint growth lines. Above the carina two spirals are stronger than the rest, with a sharp intermediate furrow. Above these are several hair-like lines, which become feebler toward the middle of the whorl and strong again above, the upper whorls presenting one in particular, which connects the row of infra-sutural beads. On the base below the carina there are four narrow and sharp spirals, followed by about eight, which are broader and flattened, and within these is one stronger than the rest, with about sixteen rounded beads, which crenulate the edge of the umbilicus. The furrows between these basal spirals are cut into little oblong pits by the longitudinals. The color is a dead creamy white, with the underlying nacre gleaming through. The spire is high and conical. The apex is flattened, with the minute, smooth, 1¬º embryonic whorl somewhat tumidly projecting. The 8¬Ω whorls show a slow and regular increase. In the earlier whorls there is a slight tumidity below the suture, a slight contraction in the middle, and a slight swelling around the base of each whorl. This last feature is feebly persistent in the later whorls, but otherwise these are flat in profile. There is a sharp carinated angle, and the base of the shell is almost flat, with an angled tubercled umbilical edge. The suture is linear, almost invisible. The aperture is perpendicular, somewhat rectangular, and broader than high. The outer lip is sharp and thin, not patulous, not descending, with a rather deep but broad and open sinus at the suture, forming a slightly acute angle at the periphery, where it advances very markedly, retreating immediately to form a sinus on the base, where it is barely arched. The columellar lip is somewhat thickened. It advances very little at its junction with the body, then retreats slightly so as to form a small sinus, bending at the same time a very little over the umbilicus. It has a sort of double point with a slight nick between them. It is very slightly reverted, and the umbilical groove behind it is very small. The umbilicus is funnel- shaped, oblique-edged, crenate on the margin, and strongly scored within, and with an oblique spiral formed by the old points of the false columellar end.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Basilissa alta) Distribution This marine species occurs off Cuba, the West Indies and Brazil.

The body whorl is provided with two .strong revolving ribs, one of which forms the periphery, while the other lies a little less than half wav from the first toward the oblique, round suture. The outer lip is sharp but strong. It is porcelaneous on the edge, brilliantly nacreous within. It descends very slightly. The white, columellar lip is thick and bent nearly to the point of the columella over the umbilicus. It would be reverted but for the great thickness of the spiral pad, which comes twining up behind it out of the umbilicus, and out of which, at the point of the columella, it forms a flat, triangular, tooth-like expansion. The umbilicus consists of a minute spiral hole, which twists in between the overlying columellar lip and the umbilical pad. The edge is corrugated with the old lines of the lip.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Turcicula imperialis) Distribution This species is distributed in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and the Lesser Antilles Offshore West coast Barbados, this species has come to light via freshly-dead 'crabbed' examples found in traps set around 600 ft. depth References * Rosenberg, G., F.

Description The size of the shell varies between 3 mm and 5 mm. The small, white shell shows a glassy minute apparently dextral nucleus and about six whorls. The first one or two have concave arched transverse ribs. The others are very strongly reticulately sculptured. The spiral sculpture consists of one very strong rib on the periphery, a slightly weaker one near the suture, and another (which is rarely absent) midway between them. On the base there are four strong spirals a little undercut at their outer edges. The transverse sculpture of strong thin oblique radii (27‚Äì30 on the last whorl) follow the lines of growth, reticulating the spirals (on crossing which they become slightly nodose) and forming deep squarish pits, which are elongated in the adult by the crowding of the radii toward the mouth. The suture appears channelled, as the whorl falls short of the peripheral rib which overhangs it, but is not really so. The base is flexuously radiately ridged but not reticulate;. The rounded apertureis thickened within and lirate. The thick columella has an obtuse knob (almost a tooth) about the middle of it. Umbilicus none ; whorls flattened above between periphery and suture.

It was so called by Watson from its resemblance to the volute of the Ionic capital. Description (Original description by Watson) The height of the shell attains 4.6 mm. The smooth, depressed shell has a conical shape. It is sharply carinate, spirally lirate, and smooth. Sculpture: There is a sharp carina at the periphery. Above this is a spiral liration formed by a sharp angulation, which on the upper whorls lies near the suture, but on the later whorls lies nearer the carina. The carina is margined below by a broad, shallow, round furrow, which is defined on its inner side by a sharp spiral thread. The umbilicus is defined by a sharp thread, outside of which is a shallow furrow and two or three more spiral threads. The centre of the base is nearly smooth, but has also some feeble spirals, which increase in strength toward the outside and toward the centre. Besides these, the whole surface is covered with sharp, not approximate, microscopic spirals. Longitudinals: tTere are numerous distinct lines of growth, which on the second whorl are like minute radiating spokes, and in the superior sinus (i. e. between the suture and the first spiral) are sharp and distinct, and more remote than elsewhere on the surface, except on the base round the umbilicus, where, though less sharp, they are even more distinct. Colour: a dead chalky white, with an exquisite pearly nacre below the outside layer and within the shell. The spire is low and scalar. The apex is flattened, the embryonic 1¬Ω whorl, though somewhat tumid and large for the genus, being somewhat immersed. The 7 whorls show a regular and slow increase until the last, which increases somewhat more rapidly. Angulated above, tumid on the base, where (unlike Carenzia carinata (Jeffreys, 1877)) the edge of the umbilicus is the most projecting part. The suture is linear, very minute, but defined by a very slight shelf, which projects horizontally just below it. The aperture is perpendicular, squarish, buttoo much broken for description. The lines of growth on the outer lip show it to have the same three sinuses as those described in Seguenzia formosa Jeffreys, 1876. The columellar margin is patulous, a little reverted, scarcely twisted, with a broad deep sinus above, a strong, but not sharp, twisted tooth projecting at about three-fourths of its length, below which is a smaller sinus running out into a point at the extreme end of the columella. The umbilicus is large, funnel-shaped, and deep. It is sharply defined by the edge of the base, the spiral of which runs out to the point of the columellar margin. Within the umbilicus is a strongish undefined spiral furrow answering to the columellar tooth, and the lines of growth are strongly defined. Watson R. B. (1878‚Äì1883). Mollusca of H. M. S.

A spinal fracture, also called a vertebral fracture or a broken back, is a fracture affecting the vertebrae of the spinal column. Most types of spinal fracture confer a significant risk of spinal cord injury. After the immediate trauma, there is a risk of spinal cord injury (or worsening of an already injured spine) if the fracture is unstable, that is, likely to change alignment without internal or external fixation. Types *Cervical fracture **Fracture of C1, including Jefferson fracture **Fracture of C2, including Hangman's fracture **Flexion teardrop fracture ‚Äì a fracture of the anteroinferior aspect of a cervical vertebra *Clay-shoveler fracture ‚Äì fracture through the spinous process of a vertebra occurring at any of the lower cervical or upper thoracic vertebrae *Burst fracture ‚Äì in which a vertebra breaks from a high-energy axial load *Compression fracture ‚Äì a collapse of a vertebra, often resulting in the form of a wedge-shape due to larger compression anteriorly *Chance fracture ‚Äì compression injury to the anterior portion of a vertebral body with concomitant distraction injury to posterior elements *Holdsworth fracture ‚Äì an unstable fracture dislocation of the thoracolumbar junction of the spine *Distraction is where there is a pulling apart of the vertebrae. Distraction injuries generally cause breaks in osseous and ligamentous supporting structures, and are therefore generally unstable. A distraction injury on the posterior side of a vertebra can lead to a compression fracture on its anterior side. Cervical fracture A medical history and physical examination can be sufficient in clearing the cervical spine. Notable clinical prediction rules to determine which patients need medical imaging are Canadian C-spine rule and the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS). The AO Foundation has developed a descriptive system for cervical fractures, the AOSpine subaxial cervical spine fracture classification system. The indication to surgically stabilize a cervical fracture can be estimated from the Subaxial Injury Classification (SLIC).Page 94 and Page 126 in: Thoracolumbar fracture Vertebral fractures of the thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae or sacrum are usually associated with major trauma and can cause spinal cord injury that results in a neurological deficit. Thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score The thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score (TLICS) is a scoring system to determine the need to surgically treat a spinal fracture of thoracic or lumbar vertebrae. The score is the sum of three values, each being the score of the most fitting alternative in three categories: Updated: Dec 09, 2014 Injury type *Compression fracture - 1 point *Burst fracture - 2 points *Translational rotational injury - 3 points *Distraction injury - 4 points Posterior ligamentous complex *Intact - 0 points *Suspected injury or indeterminate - 2 points *Injured - 3 points Neurology *Intact - 0 points *Spinal nerve root injury - 2 points *Incomplete injury of cord/conus medullaris - 3 points *Complete injury of cord/conus medullaris (complete) - 2 points *Cauda equina syndrome - 3 points A TLICS score of less than 4 indicates non-operative treatment, a score of 4 indicates that the injury may be treated operatively or non-operatively, while a score of more than 4 means that the injury is usually considered for operative management.  AOSpine Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System  AOSpine Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System (ATLICS) is the most recent classification scheme for thoracolumbar injuries.Abedi, Aidin; Mokkink, Lidwine B; Zadegan, Shayan A; Paholpak, Permsak; Tamai, Koji; Wang, Jeffrey C; Buser, Zorica (October 2018). \\"Reliability and Validity of the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System: A Systematic Review.\\" Global Spine Journal. 2192568218806847. doi:10.1177/2192568218806847. ATLICS is broadly based on the TLICS system and has sufficient reliability irrespective of the experience of the observer. ATLICS is primarily focused on fracture morphology, and has two additional sections addressing the neurological grading and clinical modifiers: = Fracture morphology = * Type A: Compression injuries (sub-types A0-A4) * Type B: Distraction injuries (sub-types B1-B3) * Type C: Translation injuries = Neurological status = * N0: neurologically intact * N1: transient deficit * N2: radiculopathy * N3: \\"incomplete spinal cord injury or cauda equina injury\\" * N4: \\"complete spinal cord injury\\" * NX: unknown neurological status = Modifiers = * M1: unknown tension band injury status * M2: comorbidities References External links  Category:Spinal cord disorders ","title":"Spinal fracture"},{"id":"27008228","text":"Valerie Landau (born 1958) is an American designer, author and educator.

Often the software's underlying node graph architecture is also exposed to the end user as a two-dimensional visualization of the node graph. The node graph architecture is popular in the film and video game industry. There are often many different node types participating in the node graph. For example, in the Nuke Manual they list hundreds of nodes. Each node type performs one specific task. For example, Nuke's Merge node produces an output image in which a number of input images have been layered. By connecting many different node types together complex image effects can be produced. The node graph architecture often allows grouping of nodes inside other group nodes. This hides complexity inside of the group nodes, and limits their coupling with other nodes outside the group. This leads to a hierarchy where smaller graphs are embedded in group nodes. In Nuke the group node is simply called the Group node. In the paper Hierarchical Small Worlds in Software Architecture they argue that most large software systems are built in a modular and hierarchical fashion, and they use node graphs to analyze large software systems. In fact many software analysis papers often use node graphs to analyze large software systems suggesting that node graphs are good models of the internal structure and operation of the software.

Dall (1889) regarded (with some doubt) Ancistrobasis as a section of the closely related genus Basilissa Watson, 1879. Description This genus contains the dentate forms of species formerly included in the genus Basilissa. Shell: The conical shell shows peripheral carina and collabral axial riblets. The midwhorl angulation and the spiral lirae are present on all whorls. The posterior sinus depth is shallow. The posterior sinus has an U-shape. The anterolateral sinus is absent. The rhomboidal aperture contains a basal and columellar sinus. The umbilical septum (a transverse plate secreted with early formed whorls of the shell) is absent. The shell contains pustulate microsculpture. Radula: The rachidian tooth is broader than high with lateral wings prominent. The lateral tooth cusp is broad.

The skulls of gymnarthrids are also small, with a single row of large conical teeth on the margin of the jaw (a feature that distinguishes them from other microsaurs). In some genera, such as Bolterpeton and Cardiocephalus, the teeth are labiolingually compressed. Gymnarthridae was first erected by E. C. Case in 1910 to include the newly described Gymnarthrus. It was placed in a new suborder, Gymnarthria. Case initially considered gymnarthrids to be reptiles, but later recognized them to be amphibians, placing Cardiocephalus in the family. Pariotichus was placed within Gymnarthridae by Alfred Romer after having previously been assigned to the basal eureptilian family Captorhinidae by Edward Drinker Cope.

Hunt is annoyed to learn that Smiley, who has a weakness for women, lost the proceeds from the latest robbery when he met a \\"dame\\". Hunt soon finds a new target for his larceny in the aged, blind Baron de Jonghe (Tully Marshall), a longtime hotel resident with an unsuspected cache of stolen money. He sets out to determine its hiding place by romancing Camille (Fay Wray), de Jonghe's attentive, inexperienced relative. When Smiley falls for Eliza Mowbray (Estelle Taylor), however, he blabs to her his boss's plan. Soon, every one of the motley assortment of fugitive criminals and murderers who inhabit the hotel knows, and Hunt is forced to promise each a share of the loot. To complicate matters even further, Hunt falls in love with Camille, and she with him. The location of the money is revealed when the baron becomes extremely agitated when Hunt offers to start a fire in his in-suite fireplace. Hunt keeps this discovery to himself, but tells Smiley to borrow the key to Eliza's car. The crooks, having grown impatient with Hunt's leisurely courtship of Camille, demand action. Hunt suggests privately to pairs of criminals that the money would be better divided amongst three partners. They all agree. Meanwhile, Alfred (Charles Hill Mailes), the baron's brother, arrives with a promise of amnesty if de Jonghe will return the money he stole. De Jonghe insists it is legitimately his, and that Camille is to have it after he is gone. Later, when de Jonghe leaves his room to enjoy holiday festivities, Hunt sneaks in, searches the chimney and locates the money. He pockets the loot and puts the metal box back where he found it, then slips away. De Jonghe becomes suspicious and returns to his room. As he is retrieving the box, he is seen by one of the crooks, who shoots him dead and flees with the box, unaware it is empty. The sound of the gunshot rouses the rest of the residents. It does not take long for them to realize that Hunt has double crossed them all. However, while Smiley holds them off with his gun, Hunt gives Camille the money and sends her to safety with Alfred de Jonghe. He tells the tearful young woman that this is the first good thing he has ever done and that she will be better off if she is not found in the company of a wanted fugitive. Then, he and Smiley make good their own escape. As they are driving off, Smiley asks about his share of the money. Hunt presents him with a flower, explaining that he met a \\"dame\\".

Cacique Guaro is a sugar cane-based liquor of high purity and is the best-selling distilled spirit in Costa Rica.Cacique site http://www.guaroliquor.com/home/index.php It is known as \\"Costa Rican liqueur\\". As it has a neutral taste, guaro can be consumed pure or combined with any natural or artificial mixing.  History  Since its beginning in 1853, the National Liquor Factory has sold the liquor in barrels through liquor agencies. The agencies, in turn, placed it in bars and other outlets in the containers that clients provided. The alcohol content of liquor was 35¬∞. Since August 1980, FANAL has marketed the liquor in a one-liter glass bottle with a low ABV of 30¬∞ under the name of Guaro Cacique. Cacique is also available in 750 ml glass bottles and 365 ml plastic bottles. FANAL produces and uses in its beverages a licensed ethyl alcohol that is intended for drinking. Fanal produces two guaro products known as Guaro Cacique (with a red label) and Cacique Superior (with a black label). The latter is 35 ABV or 70 proof. Its design is based on high purity rubbing alcohol and subjected to further purification, in which the liquor is filtered through activated carbon to increase its purity and perfect its aroma.  Origin of the name  Guaro is a term used in Central America to refer to a traditional alcohol distilled from sugar can. The word cacique means the leader of a tribe. Another factor contributing to renaming the product \\"cacique guaro\\" was an excavation made by the National Museum on land currently occupied by FANAL, where the archeologists discovered the largest known indigenous settlement to date in the canton of Grecia. The excavation took place from 1977 to 1980. The drink is nicknamed \\"cuatro plumas\\", meaning \\"four feathers\\", and refers to the cacique wearing four feathers on the label.History http://www.fanal.co.cr/historia.html  Production process  The process of making the product begins with the raw material called pre-processed alcohol, which FANAL receives mainly from mills in the area of Guanacaste. The alcohol passes into the distillate area where it begins preparation, through columns whose primary function is to purify vinasse.

Biography He was born on 24 September 1862. His father, Manuel D‚ÄôAbreo had migrated to Sindh in 1846. Cincinnatus was married to Maggie Gomes with whom he had five children, Joe, Maggie, Alfred, Gwennie and Bill. He was educated at St Patrick's High School, Karachi. However, he had to discontinue his studies at the age of 16 and earn a living, due to the unfortunate death of his father. He was first employed by the Civil and Military Gazette Press as a clerk. Two years later he joined the British business, Forbes, Forbes and Campbell, engaged in the import and export trade. In 1889, at the age of 27, he joined the Sind Commissioner's office as a clerk. In 1895 he was promoted to the position of assistant collector of Sukkur and finally was elected president of the municipality. In 1897 he returned to Karachi, where he occupied various posts such as assistant collector of customs, and shipping master. He was appointed acting collector of customs on two occasions. He was a councillor of Karachi Municipality for many years and made a remarkable contribution to civic life in Karachi. D‚ÄôAbreo was instrumental in starting the Karachi Goan Association. He also played a part in the launch of the Indian Flour Mills, the Union Press, and the Indian Life Assurance Company, of which he was secretary for many years. He was also one of the directors of the Karachi Building and Development Company. In 1917 he retired from service and devoted himself to various social activities. He was held in high esteem by the people of Karachi, who named him among the 12 leading citizens of Sindh. He died on 25 January 1929. D'Abreo acquired of land outside the cantonment.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode, \\"200\\", in which a group of angry celebrities demand South Park produce the Muslim prophet Muhammad. In \\"201\\", a superhero-like group of religious figures team up to save South Park from the celebrities and their monster Mecha-Streisand, while Eric Cartman learns the true identity of his father. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. Like \\"200\\", it alludes to several past storylines and controversies from previous South Park episodes, especially Comedy Central's refusal to show images of Muhammad on the network following controversies in 2005 and 2007 when cartoons depicting Muhammad ran in European newspapers, resulting in riots and threats. Prior to the broadcast of \\"201\\", the radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted a warning on their website that Parker and Stone risked being murdered for their depiction of Muhammad. Comedy Central modified Parker and Stone's version of the episode, obscuring all images and bleeping all references to Muhammad‚Äîto the effect of disruptively obscuring the entire two-minute moral conclusion of the story. Nevertheless, both \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010. The censorship drew strong criticism of Comedy Central. Critics said that the network's action would encourage further threats from radical groups. \\"201\\" was not shown in repeats, has not been made available on the South Park website, and has not been shown in Sweden, Hungary, Australia or the Netherlands. In most places the episode \\"Sexual Healing\\" was shown instead of episode 201. In the United Kingdom, some parts were removed, and a short on-screen message appears, stating the outline of the removed parts and \\"MTV (on Viva)\\" or \\"Comedy Central\\" \\"...has refused to air an image of Muhammad on their network\\". According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 3.5 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night. On January 31, 2014, the original uncensored version was leaked when it was pulled from the South Park Studios servers and was posted online in its entirety without approval by Comedy Central. Plot The episode opens with Cartman, as his hand-puppet persona Mitch Conner, narrating a flashback to Connor's 1972 medical discharge from his Vietnam War tour of duty in a parody of a scene from the film Apocalypse Now as the song \\"Time of the Season\\" by the Zombies plays in the background. Back in the present, Mr. Garrison refuses to reveal the identity of Cartman's father, and instead sends Cartman to Dr. Mephisto. Meanwhile, the Ginger Separatist Movement and the townsfolk are negotiating the handover of Muhammad when Mecha-Streisand begins to attack South Park. Muhammad, who is visually obscured throughout the entire episode by a black box superimposed with the word \\"CENSORED\\", is taken by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny to Dr. Mephisto's lab. The Gingers arrive and take Muhammad and Cartman captive. The Super Best Friends are called to South Park to help; after their powers fail to subdue Mecha-Streisand, they pacify her by having Krishna adopt the form of Neil Diamond and providing her the opportunity to perform a duet with him. The Gingers contact the celebrities and offer to share Muhammad in exchange for access to the celebrities' \\"goo transfer machine\\", which transfers Muhammad's power to remain free from ridicule to a target individual. Tom Cruise is the first subjected to the process, gaining a \\"CENSORED\\" box identical to Muhammad's, but further transfers are interrupted when the Super Best Friends arrive to free their comrade Muhammad. Meanwhile, Cartman is taken to the Ginger lair to meet Scott Tenorman, the Head Ginger. Depicted as a melodramatic madman, Scott has decorated his lair to represent the Chili Con- Carnival in which Cartman gained his revenge on Scott by tricking him into eating his own parents. He reveals to Cartman that they shared the same father, former Denver Broncos player Jack Tenorman, meaning that by his act of revenge against Scott, Cartman had killed his own father and fed him to his half-brother. The fight between the Super Best Friends, celebrities, and Gingers spills over into the Ginger lair, and Tenorman escapes in the confusion. During the fight, Seaman leaps upon Cruise's back, leading Stan to observe, \\"Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back.\\" The \\"CENSORED\\" box over Cruise disappears, and all present continue to make jokes based on the fact that the words \\"Seaman\\" and \\"semen\\" sound the same. Cruise questions why they are able to do this, which leads to a monologue from Kyle, Jesus Christ, and Santa Claus explaining that the goo does not exist, and that threatening people with violence is the only true answer. In the censored version, this explanation is completely obscured by a continuous audio bleep. As the town begins to rebuild following the Mecha-Streisand attack (\\"for the 39th time\\", according to Mayor McDaniels), Stan, Kyle, and Kenny find Cartman crying ‚Äì not because he learned that he murdered his father, but because he is \\"half-ginger\\". Mitch Conner reminds Cartman that he is \\"half-Bronco\\" as well and tells him that makes him \\"pretty cool\\" and departs. The boys find Cruise crying for a place in which he can live without fear of mockery. Stan, Kenny and Kyle promise to help Cruise get to such a place. The episode's closing shot is of Cruise's corpse lying on the Moon's surface alongside the corpse of the orca featured in \\"Free Willzyx\\". Production Written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, \\"201\\" was rated TV-MA-LV in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode \\"200\\", the 200th entry of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone decided to celebrate their 200th episode by revisiting several subplots that had been featured throughout the show's 14 seasons. Multiple celebrities have been lampooned throughout the series' history, inspiring Parker and Stone to have all the past celebrities join in a class action lawsuit against the town of South Park. The ginger kids‚Äîchildren with fair skin, freckles and red hair‚Äîhave been featured in several past episodes, where they were ridiculed by Cartman, who views them with prejudice. Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner who originally appeared in the seventh season episode \\"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\\", in which Cartman pretends his hand is Jennifer Lopez and uses many Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her. Cartman regards Connor as a separate entity and has conversations with him, while Stan and Kyle do not accept this idea at all. \\"201\\" also included several characters and subplots that were not featured in \\"200\\", such as the return of Dr. Alphonse Mephisto and Kevin, characters that had not been featured on South Park for about 10 years. Other previously recurring characters made appearances in \\"201\\", including Mr. Hankey, Big Gay Al, Mr. Slave and Pip Pirrup. Scott Tenorman, and the references to Cartman's murder of Scott's parents, were from the fifth season episode \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\". At the end of \\"201\\", the dead body of Tom Cruise lies alongside the corpse of a killer whale, a reference to the ninth season episode \\"Free Willzyx\\", in which the South Park boys help an orca escape a marine amusement park and flee to the moon, believing it to be a paradise. Pip Pirrup, who became a background character after his own eponymous episode and made only two speaking roles after before completely disappearing from the show in Season 11, makes a brief appearance and is killed off when Mecha-streisand steps on him. Muhammad storyline An image of the Muslim prophet Muhammad was shown in the 2001 episode \\"Super Best Friends\\", but was censored from the 2006 episode \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\" due to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. This change in Comedy Central's broadcast policy was mocked in the episode \\"200\\", which led to further censorship in \\"201\\". One of the most prominent storylines from \\"200\\", which continued into \\"201\\", was the characters' efforts to bring Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 (Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy) and 2007 (Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, resulting in riots, global protests, and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad in any form, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule. Parker and Stone have previously voiced dissatisfaction that images of Muhammad had been censored on the show despite the fact that his image was shown during the 2001 episode \\"Super Best Friends\\", without any censorship, before the cartoon controversies began. \\"201\\" continues the theme from \\"200\\" that argues against fear and censorship, and calls for support of free speech, both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo. Threats and censorship  300px In the week between the broadcasts of \\"200\\" and \\"201\\", the website for the New York-based radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risked violent retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. The entry stated that they \\"will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show.\\" Van Gogh was a filmmaker who was murdered by a man named Mohammed Bouyeri in 2004 for making a short documentary on violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. The author of the post, Zachary Adam Chesser, said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest. The entry included audio clips of a sermon by al-Qaeda imam Anwar al-Awlaki calling for the assassination of anyone who has defamed Muhammad, saying, \\"Harming Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that.\\" Subsequently, the website for the organization was hacked, temporarily redirecting web traffic to images of Prophet Muhammad with a bomb on his head and an older Muslim man passionately kissing a young boy. Before \\"201\\" aired, the New York City Police Department increased security at the Comedy Central headquarters in direct response to the threats. Law enforcement officials said Revolution Muslim itself was \\"all talk\\" and had never engaged in any actual violence but they were concerned that the website post could inspire violence from others. During the original broadcast of \\"201\\" on April 21, 2010, all references to Muhammad's name were obscured by audio bleeps. Several other portions of dialogue were also censored, including almost the entirety of three consecutive monologues spoken by Kyle, Jesus and Santa Claus at the end regarding the moral of the episode. Muhammad's name appeared in the previous episode, \\"200\\", without any such censorship. Both episodes obscured all images of what was apparently Muhammad with a black \\"CENSORED\\" box. Immediately after the episode \\"201\\" aired, the series website South Park Studios posted a notice that said Comedy Central had inserted \\"numerous additional bleeps throughout the episode\\" after Parker and Stone submitted their final cut to the network. The network later confirmed they were responsible for the audio censorship. On April 22, 2010, South Park Studios released a brief statement: Some of these developments had been anticipated in the 2006 South Park episodes \\"Cartoon Wars Part I\\" and \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\". These episodes showed South Park's reaction to a controversy regarding censorship of Muhammad depictions on two (fictional) episodes of Family Guy. In the United States \\"201\\" has never re- aired following its original debut as South Park would usually repeat during the week, and episodes from earlier in the season were shown instead. Although South Park Studios generally makes unexpurgated versions of their episodes immediately available to view, the notice indicated Parker and Stone did not have network approval to show their original version, and thus no version of \\"201\\" could be seen on the website. The Canadian Comedy Network aired \\"201\\" on April 25, 2010, though the episode was censored as the American broadcast was, breaking the channel's multi-year practice of airing South Park completely uncensored. Neither \\"200\\" nor \\"201\\" were shown in the version of Comedy Central in the Netherlands, and neither episode is available on the Dutch South Park Studios website. The Swedish affiliate of Comedy Central also refused to broadcast \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" in Sweden, claiming: > Comedy Central has decided not to air these two episodes of South Park. It > is a decision we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes > strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply > insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express > themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is > our unquestioned number one priority, and therefore we have decided to take > these precautionary measures. \\"Super Best Friends\\" was also pulled from the South Park Studios site following the increased media attention from \\"201\\". Cultural references During Mitch Conner's flashback of the Vietnam War at the beginning of the episode, \\"Time of the Season\\" by English rock group the Zombies plays in the background. The scenes between Cartman and Scott Tenorman closely mirror a scene from the 1988 graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke where the Joker tortures and taunts Commissioner Gordon. Mecha-Streisand is defeated by her inability to resist performing duets with Neil Diamond, a pop singer- songwriter. During one scene, Mecha-Streisand crushes a building and someone screams, \\"The Casa Bonita is gone!\\" This is the name of a real-life restaurant that had been seen in the episode \\"Casa Bonita\\", and after which Parker and Stone's production facility was named. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on April 21, 2010, \\"201\\" was watched by 3.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. It outperformed the previous week's episode, \\"200\\", which was seen by 3.33 million viewers. Reviews The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal said \\"201\\" was an improvement over \\"200\\", but nevertheless felt \\"201\\" was \\"less a cohesive episode than a grab bag of balls- out crazy scenes and cameos only loyal fans would really appreciate.\\" However, he also said, \\"it's sure to become one of, if not the most talked-about episode of South Park ever.\\" Even after Comedy Central announced they were responsible for the censorship in \\"201\\", he speculated as to whether it was possibly a publicity stunt by Parker and Stone to create controversy and increase viewership. Ramsey Isler of IGN said the episode built on the events of \\"200\\" and delivered a strong payoff, particularly with the subplot about Cartman's father and the way it tied back to \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\". Isler said the bleeps added by Comedy Central provided some unintentional laughs and underscored the episode's underlying theme opposing censorship. Response to censorship According to a Zogby International survey conducted after \\"201\\" aired, a majority of Americans opposed Comedy Central's censorship of the episode. 71% disagreed with the network's decision to censor \\"201\\", with only 19% agreeing with the decision. 47% of those who disagreed with the censorship said they disagreed strongly, with only 5% who agreed claiming they felt strongly. Some commentators suggested because Comedy Central responded to Revolution Muslim's warnings by censoring depictions of Muhammad, the Muslim extremists scored a significant public victory. Michael Cavna of The Washington Post wrote, \\"To invoke the revivified phrase: The terrorists win.\\" Toronto Sun columnist Mike Strobel pointed out Revolution Muslim is a relatively small group of \\"a half-dozen wannabe Osamas\\", but said because of Comedy Central's response, \\"The loonies and terrorists win one. No doubt, they'll try this stunt again.\\" Likewise, Jean Marbella of The Baltimore Sun said, \\"It's not even that the terrorists have won, it's that wannabe terrorists have won.\\" Margaret Wente of The Globe and Mail said the censorship of \\"201\\" could be \\"the lowest point in the history of American TV\\", and that it represented a gravitation toward fear in a post-September 11 attacks world. Los Angeles Times columnist Patrick Goldstein said there were \\"no easy answers\\" and that he was not surprised Comedy Central took the threat seriously, but added, \\"in a democracy, artists and political satirists should be allowed to say what they believe, even if it offends some of its audience\\". Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant suggested Comedy Central actually drew more attention to the Muhammad controversy, not less, by censoring the episode. UCLA School of Law Professor Eugene Volokh said Comedy Central's actions risk empowering other extremists: > The consequence of this position is that the thugs win and people have more > incentive to be thugs. There are lots of people out there who would very > much like to get certain kind of material removed, whether religious or > political. The more they see others winning, the more they will be likely to > do the same. Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated. Seventeen Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonists protested the threats in a petition released April 27, 2010. Among the signatures were those of Garry Trudeau, Mark Fiore, Tony Auth, David Horsey and Paul Szep. The petition stated: > We, the undersigned, condemn the recent threats against the creators of > South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, by the extremist organization, > Muslim Revolution. Freedom of expression is a universal right and we reject > any group that seeks to silence people by violence or intimidation. In the > United States we have a proud tradition of political satire and believe in > the right to speak or draw freely without censorship.Petition, \\"Pulitzer > Prize winning editorial cartoonists issue condemnation of threat against > South Park Creators\\" (sic), dated April 27, 2010, as posted on the > Washington Post website. Retrieved April 30, 2010. During the April 22 broadcast of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart responded to the censorship of \\"201\\" with a ten-minute monologue about the death threats, expressing disgust toward Revolution Muslim, culminating with a song telling Revolution Muslim to \\"go fuck [themselves]\\". Stewart criticized Comedy Central's decision to alter the episode, while simultaneously acknowledging they likely did so to protect their employees from \\"possible harmful repercussions\\". Bill Maher, host of the HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, said the threats against \\"201\\" demonstrated the importance of the First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, \\"When South Park got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served‚Äîor should serve‚Äîas a reminder that our culture isn't just different than one that makes death threats to cartoonists. It's better.\\" He added jokingly, \\"If you don't get that, and you still want to kill someone over a stupid cartoon, please make it Garfield.\\" As a result of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle cartoonist Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the \\"first annual Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\". However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, on the advice of the FBI. Animated comedy series Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane voiced this ambivalence on the part of the creative community, saying \\"No one is a bigger critic of organized religion than I am\\", but nevertheless added, \\"It's tricky. You pick your battles. You have to judge how real the threat is against how funny the joke is. How much do I care about the joke?\\" And The Simpsons also addressed the apparent hypocrisy of those who claimed to stand with South Park in a chalkboard gag during the opening sequence of the April 25, 2010 episode \\"The Squirt and the Whale\\", with Bart Simpson writing \\"South Park‚ÄîWe'd Stand Beside You If We Weren't So Scared\\". In a 2016 oral history of South Park in The Hollywood Reporter, Vernon Chatman, the voice of Towelie as well as a writer and producer on the show said that after Comedy Central censored the episode, series co-creator Trey Parker purchased a ticket to South Africa and showed it to the head of the network as a threat because Dave Chappelle had fled to Africa, though Parker never actually went. Sri Lanka ban The depiction of Buddha snorting cocaine in \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" prompted the government of Sri Lanka to ban the entire series outright. Home release The fourteenth season of South Park was released April 26, 2011 to DVD and Blu-ray, including the episode \\"201\\". When playing the episode, prior to the theme playing, a text card appears saying: \\"The following episode appears as it originally aired on April 21, 2010. After it aired Matt Stone and Trey Parker released the following statement\\" and then shows the original message that was released after the episode aired. Consequently, Muhammad, his name, and the speeches made by Kyle, Jesus, and Santa are still censored as in the broadcast version. Although the end speeches are still censored, the bleeps are accompanied with music on DVD, unlike the April 21, 2010 airing, which featured a raw audio bleep. In the episode's audio commentary, Parker only comments on the opening scene, noting that they did the episode as intended and sent it in. He and Stone comment that they are not supposed to talk about it. For the next several moments, a large audio beep obscures the commentary before Stone says \\"Yeah, that's pretty much it.\\" During the commentary in both \\"201\\" and \\"200\\" Parker and Stone never mention Muhammad directly, referring to him only as \\"the prophet of the Muslim faith\\". Despite the package claiming otherwise, both \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" were omitted from the Region 4 release and have been completely omitted from the Region 2 (which contains the predominantly Islamic Middle East and North Africa) release as well. Online leak of uncensored version On January 31, 2014, the original uncensored version of this episode was illegally leaked and distributed online without any approval of Comedy Central after a user on 4chan realized that the episode existed on the official website's web server and could be downloaded using rtmpdump.

Understanding the distributions of income and wealth in an economy has been a classic problem in economics for more than a hundred years. Today it is one of the main branches of econophysics. Data and basic tools In 1897, Vilfredo Pareto first found a universal feature in the distribution of wealth. After that, with some notable exceptions, this field had been dormant for many decades, although accurate data had been accumulated over this period. Considerable investigations with the real data during the last fifteen years (1995‚Äì2010) revealed that the tail (typically 5 to 10 percent of agents in any country) of the income/wealth distribution indeed follows a power law. However, the majority of the population (i.e., the low-income population) follows a different distribution which is debated to be either Gibbs or log-normal. Basic tools used in this type of modelling are probabilistic and statistical methods mostly taken from the kinetic theory of statistical physics. Monte Carlo simulations often come handy in solving these models. Overview of the models Since the distributions of income/wealth are the results of the interaction among many heterogeneous agents, there is an analogy with statistical mechanics, where many particles interact. This similarity was noted by Meghnad Saha and B. N. Srivastava in 1931 (the page is reproduced in Fig. 6 in Sitabhra Sinha, Bikas K Chakrabarti, Towards a physics of economics, Physics News 39(2) 33-46, April 2009) and thirty years later by Benoit Mandelbrot. In 1986, an elementary version of the stochastic exchange model was first proposed by J. Angle. In the context of kinetic theory of gases, such an exchange model was first investigated by A. Dragulescu and V. Yakovenko. The main modelling effort has been put to introduce the concepts of savings, and taxation in the setting of an ideal gas-like system. Basically, it assumes that in the short-run, an economy remains conserved in terms of income/wealth; therefore law of conservation for income/wealth can be applied. Millions of such conservative transactions lead to a steady state distribution of money (gamma function-like in the Chakraborti-Chakrabarti model with uniform savings, and a gamma-like bulk distribution ending with a Pareto tail in the Chatterjee-Chakrabarti-Manna model with distributed savings) and the distribution converges to it. The distributions derived thus have close resemblance with those found in empirical cases of income/wealth distributions. Though this theory has been originally derived from the entropy maximization principle of statistical mechanics, it has recently been shown that the same could be derived from the utility maximization principle as well, following a standard exchange-model with Cobb-Douglas utility function. The exact distributions produced by this class of kinetic models are known only in certain limits and extensive investigations have been made on the mathematical structures of this class of models. The general forms have not been derived so far. Criticisms This class of models has attracted criticisms from many dimensions. It has been debated for long whether the distributions derived from these models are representing the income distributions or wealth distributions. The law of conservation for income/wealth has also been a subject of criticism.

The phrase is a translation of the Latin phrase fratres seiuncti. Before the Second Vatican Council, per the pronouncements of the Council of Trent, the Catholic Church had officially referred to Protestants and other Christians as \\"heretics\\" likely not having hope of salvation outside of the \\"Church of Rome\\". However, Biblical passages like Romans 2:12-16 point to the importance of conscience in Catholic soteriology, which the Roman Catholic Church states it has always recognized. In preparation work for draft texts of Second Vatican Council documents, a \\"report urged respectful use of the terms dissidents or separated brethren, in place of heretics and schismatics.\\" After the Second Vatican Council, however, \\"that habit of unthinkingly hurling accusations of heresy at Protestants pretty much died out\\". Since at least the mid-1990s, the term has often been replaced by Catholic officials with phrases such as \\"other Christians\\". At least one Catholic writer, William J. Whalen, did not consider Mormons and members of some other religious groups to be separated brethren. Among the groups Whalen did not consider to be \\"separated brethren\\" were \\"Jews, Mormons, Christian Scientists, Muslims, Buddhists, and other groups\\". During a period of lessening tensions with Jewish groups, Pope John Paul II once referred to Jews as \\"elder brothers in the faith of Abraham\\", prior to a 1987 visit to the United States. History The concept and wording was published as late as 1793, in a discourse which examined two papal briefs to the Bishop of Chiusi-Pienza. Here, ' is spelled ' and '. Frank Flinn wrote, in Encyclopedia of Catholicism, that in 1959 Pope John XXIII \\"addressed Protestants as separated brethren,\\" in Ad Petri cathedram (APC), which Flinn saw as \\"an important step toward recognizing Protestants as legitimate partners in a future dialogue.\\" But Pope Leo XIII \\"was the first to speak of 'separated brothers according to John Norman Davidson Kelly's A Dictionary of Popes. Edward Farrugia, in Gregorianum, describes the development from Pope Leo XIII's Orientalium dignitas (OD) to Orientalium Ecclesiarum (OE) to Unitatis Redintegratio (UR). \\"Yet if builds on , differences remain. Whereas \\" 186 \\"speaks of 'dissident bretheren' ('), 28 speaks of 'separated bretheren' ('), although it does not go as far as 14, where there is an inchoative use of the language of 'sister Churches' (').\\" Farrugia noted Austin Flannery's translations in Vatican Council II, \\" 29 speaks of the 'separated Churches' and 25 of 'any separated Eastern Christians', and 29 of 'Eastern separated brethren'.\\" J. M. R. Tillard goes into detail, in New Catholic Encyclopedia, about \\"the development of a carefully nuanced vocabulary, consistent with Vatican II Ecclesiology,\\" which evolved from \\"the idea of membership in favor of that of incorporation\\" and has its categorization found in the dogmatic constitution ' (LG) which Tillard describes: *Catholics are defined as being incorporated' ('), qualifying the term with the adverb 'fully' (') and emphasizing that full incorporation requires the presence of the Holy Spirit.\\" *Non-Catholics and catechumens are defined as being linked' (') to the Church, again carefully stressing the role of the Holy Spirit in each case.\\" *Non-Christians are defined as being related' ('), a term that suggests a dynamic relationship, an orientation toward the Church.\\" \\"Every shade of difference in meaning among these terms is important,\\" emphasizes Tillard. \\"But the terms acquire their full force only in the light of the most authoritative commentaries on them,\\" and Nostra aetate (NA). \\"Then, supposing the nuances indicated, the richness of such expressions as the following becomes clear: 'Churches and ecclesial communities'; 'separated brethren'; 'separated Churches and ecclesial communities'; 'full communion'‚Äî'imperfect communion'.\\" \\"But thanks to its ecclesiology,\\" wrote Tillard, \\"Vatican II was able to affirm at the same time that Churches or ecclesial communities separated from the Catholic Church are part of the single Church, and that nevertheless incorporation in Christ and His Church possesses within the Catholic Church the fullness that it does not have elsewhere.\\" In 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) clarified \\"the authentic meaning\\" of the ecclesiological expression \\"Church\\" which \\"according to Catholic doctrine\\", the texts of the Second Vatican Council and those of the Magisterium since the Second Vatican Council do not call Christian Communities born out of the Reformation of the 16th century as \\"Churches\\" because \\"these Communities do not enjoy apostolic succession in the sacrament of Orders, and are, therefore, deprived of a constitutive element of the Church.\\" William Whalen wrote, in Separated Brethren, that separated brethren' refers to Christians united by baptism and committed to Jesus Christ but divided by theological beliefs.\\" Whalen explained, that Protestant Reformation Christians broke \\"the bond of common faith\\" and \\"they became separated brethren.\\" \\"All Christians who are baptized and believe in Christ but are not professed Catholics\\" are separated brethren, according to John Hardon in Modern Catholic Dictionary. \\"More commonly the term is applied to Protestants.\\" Likewise, \\"separated brethren\\" according to Catholic Answers, in This Rock, \\"refers to those who, though separated from full communion with the Catholic Church, have been justified through baptism and are thus brethren in Christ.\\" \\"teaches that 'all who have been justified by faith in baptism are members of Christ's body, and have a right to be called Christian, and so are correctly accepted as brothers by the children of the Catholic Church'.\\" J. A. Jungmann and K. Stasiak wrote, in New Catholic Encyclopedia, that \\"the Second Vatican Council's call for a greater spirit of ecumenism among churches and ecclesial communities reflects the understanding that Baptism is the effecting and the sign of the fundamental unity of all Christians.\\" Exclusions Because Mormonism is polytheistic in its understanding of the Trinity, the Catholic Church does not recognize the validity of Mormon baptism and Mormons are not considered separated brethren.\\" Cardinal Urbano Navarrete Cort√©s clarified, in L'Osservatore Romano, \\"that in all of the effects of the pastoral, administrative and juridical practices of the Church the Mormons are not to be considered as belonging to an 'ecclesial community not in full communion with the Catholic Church', but simply as non-baptized.\\" Baptism conferred by The Christian Community, founded by Rudolf Steiner; The New Church, founded by Emanuel Swedenborg; conferred with the formula \\"I baptize you in the name of the Creator, and of the Redeemer, and of the Sanctifier\\"; or, conferred with the formula \\"I baptize you in the name of the Creator, and of the Liberator, and of the Sustainer\\" are also deemed not valid.

She spent the war as a trials vessel and was scuttled on 5 May 1945 in Gelting Bay. U-794 was built by Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, Kiel. The keel was laid down on 1 February 1943, the boat was launched on 7 October. She was commissioned on 14 November. The Feldpost Number was M 52 496. U-794 did not undertake any combat patrols and was instead assigned as a trials boat at first to the 5th U-boat Flotilla, followed by the 8th U-boat Flotilla, before returning to the 5th flotilla for the rest of the war. In late March 1944, Admiral Karl D√∂nitz and four other admirals took part in a trial of U-794. Although they were enthusiastic, the boat, designed for high underwater speed (over 20 m.p.h.) was difficult to manoeuvre, and the keel to beam ratio was too high.

Association football  Uruguay in Stadium Australia, during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying play-off . The Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) is one of six association football confederations under the auspices of FIFA, the international governing body of the sport. The OFC is the only confederation without an automatic qualification to the World Cup. Currently the winner of the OFC qualification tournament must play-off against a team from either Asia, North America, or South America to qualify for the World Cup. Currently, Vanuatu is the only country in Oceania to call football its national sport. However, it is the most popular sport in Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, and has a significant (and growing) popularity in New Zealand. Oceania has been represented at four World Cup finals tournaments ‚Äî Australia in 1974 and 2006 and New Zealand in 1982 and 2010. In 2006, Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation and qualified for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups as an Asian entrant. New Zealand qualified through the Oceania Confederation, winning its playoff against Bahrain. This made 2010 the first time that two countries from (geographic) Oceania had qualified at the same time, albeit through different confederations. The Oceania Football Confederation was founded in 1966. It organises the FIFA World Cup qualifier, the OFC Nations Cup for national teams and the OFC Champions League for clubs.

New Zealand is also considered a strong competitor in the sport, with the New Zealand cricket team, also called the Black Caps, enjoying success in many competitions. Both Australia and New Zealand are Full members of the ICC. Fiji, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea are some of the Associate/Affiliate members of the ICC in Oceania that are governed by ICC East Asia-Pacific.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes, however by the 1990s tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers we see today. Synopsis The Tornado \\"Season\\" of 1991 looks generally very average on paper. The spring months of March, April, May and June all saw very large numbers of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks. The fall, sometimes referred to as a \\"second season\\", was very quiet. The Andover, Kansas outbreak of April 26, 1991 was famous for its violent tornadoes, incredible video and is the signature event of this tornado season. 1991 saw one F5 tornado touch down in Kansas. Events Confirmed tornado total for the entire year 1991 in the United States. January There were 29 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January. February There were 11 tornadoes confirmed in the US in February. March There were 157 tornadoes confirmed in the US in March. March 22 Tornadoes killed six people in Kentucky and Tennessee. An 11-year-old boy was killed in Olmstead in Logan County, Kentucky when an F2 tornado picked up a mobile home and slammed it against a tree. March 26‚Äì27 March 26 saw an outbreak of 21 tornadoes, including an F4 twister near Hutchinson, Kansas (no fatalities). Two more people were killed by tornadoes in Wisconsin and Indiana on March 27. March 29 An F1 tornado in Talladega County, Alabama killed five people. April There were 204 tornadoes confirmed in the US in April.  April 26  This violent tornado outbreak of 55 tornadoes took place on April 26, 1991, killing 24 people and injuring hundreds more. The killer Andover tornado was rated F5, while four others were rated F4, including the monstrous Red Rock tornado. At the time, the Red Rock tornado generated the highest wind speeds, detected by mobile doppler radar, until the May 3, 1999, Bridge Creek-Moore F5 tornado. This is also the outbreak from which the infamous video was shot by a news crew hiding under an overpass in Kansas. This early viral video spread the myth that sheltering underneath an overpass was safer during a tornado. The television crew was hit by a F2 tornado. May There were 335 tornadoes confirmed in the US in May. May 10 Three tornadoes formed in Lazbuddie, Texas. May 15 An outbreak of five tornadoes struck Western and Northwestern Oklahoma. The strongest was a 800‚Äì900 yard wide F3 tornado that tracked 11.5 miles near Laverne, injuring three people. The same cell also dropped hail up to the size of grapefruits. June There were 216 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June. June 14 An F0 tornadic waterspout (starts as a tornado) reported near Lake Okeechobee, Florida created a surreal nighttime sight of a tornado and lightning while only doing minor damage. A famous photo of the event, which includes a mixture of brown and black color of the tornado accompanied with a lightning strike, was taken by Fred Smith, who was photographing the tornado from his backyard. July There were 64 tornadoes confirmed in the US in July, including one in Cass County, Minnesota featured on some tornado-themed documentaries. August There were 46 tornadoes confirmed in the US in August. September There were 26 tornadoes confirmed in the US in September. October There were 21 tornadoes confirmed in the US in October.

Its latitude is 43.043 and its longitude is -85.411.  History  The area in which it is currently located was once the home of the Ottawa people. After the 1836 Treaty of Washington opened up the land for European settlement, the former inhabitants were quickly replaced by Europeans. In the late 1830s and '40s, Irish immigrants settled the area, which had the advantages of prime farmland and a location reasonably close to a metropolitan center, Grand Rapids, Michigan. By 1844, it is estimated that 20-30 Irish families were settled in the area now known as Parnell. That year, the community came together to worship with a priest sent from Grand Rapids, most frequently in the home of Michael Farrell. By the end of the year, planning for St. Patrick's Catholic Church had begun. The current structure, dating from 1878, is located across the street from the original church.History of St. Patrick's Catholic Church The steeple of the church was renovated in 2005. Saint Patrick School in Parnell was founded by Catholic priest James Crumley in 1893, and moved into its current building in 1963. The school serves children from preschool through 8th grade. Parnell is also the home of a monastery of Discalced Carmelite nuns, founded in 1916.

Generally speaking, the space center's mission focuses on astrophysics, which includes cosmology. The emphasis is on accomplishing basic research in this science. The research leads into exploring the composition, and structure of astronomical objects, interstellar and interplanetary space along with exploring how these evolved. ASC divisions The Astro Space Center is separated into three divisions, two of which are national observatories. These three divisions are the \\" Moscow branch\\", the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory, and Kalyazin Radio Astronomy Observatory. The ASC divisions accomplish research, and achieve scientific milestones, and perform administrative duties as well. Moscow branch The Moscow branch () is itself divided into approximately eight divisions. These branches conduct research in Theoretical physics, the thermal history of the universe, Division of Quantum Astrophysics and MS Burgin, VL Kautz, NN Shakhvorostova \\"On the influence of shock transitions on cosmological hydrogen recombination spectrum\\" Astronomy Letters, v. 32, p. 1 (2006). various properties of extragalactic objects, Space Radio Astronomy, and AE Volvach et al, \\"Variability of radiation blazar 3–°454.3 for the period 40 years,\\" Astronomical Journal, 2007, Volume 84, ‚Ññ 6, pp. 503-513. and design and development of space and astronomy research equipment Department of Space Electronics The research of the Moscow Branch enters other related areas of research. Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory Another division of ASC LPI is the Pushchino observatory, at . It has an array of antennas running N-S and E-W, and produced a fan beam in the sky. It is sited near Pushchino. It employs 45 researchers along with 60 engineers and technicians to accomplish staff the several major departments and several labs of the observatory. These are combined with 80 other people who perform administrative duties, workshops, garage, and a staff of guards. The departments and labs are designed to focus on scientific and technical aspects of observatory sciences. The departments are as follows: Plasma astrophysics, Extragalactic radio astronomy, Pulsar physics, Space radio spectroscopy, and Pulsar astrometry. The laboratories are as follows: Radio astronomy equipment, Automation radio astronomy research, Computer engineering and information technology, and Radio telescopes of the meter wavelength range. Kalyazin Radio Astronomy Observatory Another, third division, is the Kalyazin Radio Astronomy Observatory, at . It has a dish antenna to the east of Kalyazin. Achievements of the ASC The ASC has led the development and deployment of an international VLBI project. It is called the RadioAstron. VLBI stands for (Very Long Baseline Interferometry), for radio astronomy. It allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many telescopes to be combined, emulating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes.RadioAstron.

Geography Tilaiya is located at . Tilaiya Dam Tilaiya Dam was constructed by Damodar Valley Corporation across the Barakar River in 1953. It is long and high. The dam boasts of picturesque surroundings with a reservoir, which extends up to 36 km2. Tilaiya hydro power station is located on the left bank of the Barakar. The structure is entirely of reinforced concrete. It has 2 generating units of 2 MW each. Demography Kanti village, near Tilaiya Dam and located on the south side (or left bank) of the Barakar River, has a population, as per 2011 Census of India, of 4,601 (males 2,785 and females 1,826). It is in Chandwara (community development block). A little further away is Barki Dhamrai with a population of 3,277 and Chotki Dhamrai with 1,290 people. Tilaia is a smaller village on the other side of Barakar River. It possibly lent its name to the dam. Transport Tilaiya Dam is from Koderma Railway Station. Barhi on NH 2 is away. While Tilaiya Dam is off the Patna- Ranchi highway (NH 31), the latter passes along the reservoir.
