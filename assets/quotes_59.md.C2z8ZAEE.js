In mathematics, the supernatural numbers, sometimes called generalized natural numbers or Steinitz numbers, are a generalization of the natural numbers. They were used by Ernst Steinitz in 1910 as a part of his work on field theory. A supernatural number \\\\omega is a formal product: : \\\\omega = \\\\prod_p p^{n_p}, where p runs over all prime numbers, and each n_p is zero, a natural number or infinity. Sometimes v_p(\\\\omega) is used instead of n_p. If no n_p = \\\\infty and there are only a finite number of non-zero n_p then we recover the positive integers. Slightly less intuitively, if all n_p are \\\\infty, we get zero. Supernatural numbers extend beyond natural numbers by allowing the possibility of infinitely many prime factors, and by allowing any given prime to divide \\\\omega \\"infinitely often,\\" by taking that prime's corresponding exponent to be the symbol \\\\infty. There is no natural way to add supernatural numbers, but they can be multiplied, with \\\\prod_p p^{n_p}\\\\cdot\\\\prod_p p^{m_p}=\\\\prod_p p^{n_p+m_p}. Similarly, the notion of divisibility extends to the supernaturals with \\\\omega_1\\\\mid\\\\omega_2 if v_p(\\\\omega_1)\\\\leq v_p(\\\\omega_2) for all p. The notion of the least common multiple and greatest common divisor can also be generalized for supernatural numbers, by defining : \\\\displaystyle \\\\operatorname{lcm}({\\\\omega_i}) \\\\displaystyle =\\\\prod_p p^{\\\\sup(v_p(\\\\omega_i))} : \\\\displaystyle \\\\operatorname{gcd}({\\\\omega_i}) \\\\displaystyle =\\\\prod_p p^{\\\\inf(v_p(\\\\omega_i))} With these definitions, the gcd or lcm of infinitely many natural numbers (or supernatural numbers) is a supernatural number. We can also extend the usual p-adic order functions to supernatural numbers by defining v_p(\\\\omega)=n_p for each p Supernatural numbers are used to define orders and indices of profinite groups and subgroups, in which case many of the theorems from finite group theory carry over exactly. They are used to encode the algebraic extensions of a finite field.Brawley & Schnibben (1989) pp.25-26 They are also used implicitly in many number-theoretical proofs, such as the density of the square-free integers and bounds for odd perfect numbers.

Washington Athletic Club. Retrieved on 1 October 2008. History The Harvard Club was founded by a group of 22 Harvard alumni in 1908. The original dues were $5.00 per year, and by the end of the year, more than 1,200 members had joined. The first president, Henry Lee Higginson, was also the founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1909, the Club established its first scholarships, awarding grants of $200 to local high school students who would be attending Harvard. One of the first recipients of these scholarships, James Bryant Conant, went on to become the 23rd president of Harvard. In 1912‚Äì1913, the Club decided to construct a clubhouse, the Back Bay Clubhouse at 374 Commonwealth Avenue. In 1925, eight squash courts were built. During the Great Depression the Club acted as an employment agency, posting a list of positions needed by members who were out of a job. During World War II, cots were placed in these courts and lodging was offered to military officers at the cost of $1.50 per night. In 1971, women, once limited to dining in the women's annex while the men dined in Harvard Hall, were welcomed as full and active members for the first time in the Club's history. In 1976, the Downtown Clubhouse was purchased at One Federal Street, providing a location more convenient to most of Boston's offices. In 2003, the Downtown Clubhouse underwent a $2.5 million renovation. In 2015, a $16 million renovation of the Back Bay Clubhouse was completed, providing members with new dining spaces, a wine room, enhanced function and member spaces, renovated overnight rooms, a new elevator, and upgraded athletics center. In 2016, after 108 years, the Club welcomed its first female President, Karen Van Winkle, a Harvard College alumna and native of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ms. Van Winkle's three-year term, ushered in a new era for the organization as it grows and diversifies its membership and enhance its presence in Greater Boston. In 2016, the Club was named a Platinum Club of America, an award given to only the top 4% of private clubs nationwide. In 2017, Harvard Hall at the Back Bay Clubhouse was named \\"Best Ballroom\\" in the city by Boston Magazine. And, in 2018 the Club was named a Platinum Club of the World ‚Äì the only private city club in New England to achieve this distinction. Today, the Club is a diverse group of about 5,000 members living in 40 countries around the globe.

It is a scripture in the Swaminarayan denomination of the Hindu religion. It was documented in the mid 19th century over the course of Gunatitanand Swami's 40 year tenure as the Mahant of Junagadh Mandir. Gunatitanand Swami  Biography  Gunatitanand Swami was born in the village of Bhadra in modern-day Gujarat, India, on 17 October 1785 (on the occasion of Sharad Poonam). Originally named Mulji Jani, as a child, he was engaged in the devotion of God at an early age. He was initiated as Gunatitanand Swami by Swaminarayan as a paramhansa of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Gunatitanand Swami was referred to as Mul-Akshar Murti/Brahm.  Philosophy  Through his talks, Swamini Vato, Gunatitanand Swami gave advice for every aspect of life and beyond. Topics ranged from the glory of God, and how to gain spiritual knowledge, to how to attain peace and happiness. The scripture is believed to have discussed the value of human life itself.  Compilation and publishing  When Gunatitanand Swami delivered discourses, devotees took notes on his talks. The notes were later studied by Achintyanand Brahmachari, after being asked by Gunatitanand Swami to continue giving discourses on these topics. At this point, the Swamini Vato was officially dubbed a scripture by the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. The original set of Vatos has 5 prakrans (chapters) and was compiled by Balmukunddas Swami, who was a disciple of Gunatitanand Swami. The BAPS sect has published a new edition of the Vatos which includes the addition of two more prakrans compiled by Krishnaji Ada, another disciple of Gunatitanand Swami, based on claims of the latest research and critical study of the original text.

(Translation) The game was originally developed and released as a personal computer game in 1979, and was then published by as an arcade game in May 1980. The game has been ported to several other gaming systems since its original release. Gameplay Screenshot from the arcade version. The player (bottom right) is digging a hole to trap incoming enemies. The player controls a Heian period police officer () who must defend the capital city () from an alien invasion by digging holes in the ground and filling them back up after an alien falls inside. The player scores points for every alien trapped, and the quicker the hole is filled up after the alien falls in, the higher the number of points are scored. The aliens increase in number as the levels progress, and they can escape from holes after a certain period of time elapses or if another alien passes above their hole. The player loses if he comes in contact with an alien. There is a time limit for each level, and the number of aliens increases drastically when this limit is reached, essentially preventing the player from completing the level. The player can enter his name on the arcade machine if a high score is reached. In the original version of the game, a unique cursor is employed where the player selects a letter by having his character walk through the street that displays the desired letter. The game also contains a two-player mode, where the players can either alternate turns or play on the same screen simultaneously. The arcade version uses a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, and the arcade system board used is a copied version of the one used by Sega's Head On. Since the original system board itself was a copy, Heian-ky≈ç Aliens system board was easily duplicated, and many of the units distributed to arcade centers were \\"copies of a copy\\" created by other companies. Few of the original units manufactured by Denki Onky≈ç remain in place today. Development Heiankyo Alien was created by the Theoretical Science Group, a small group of students at the University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan ‚Äî established in 1959, they focused primarily on computer science and soldering, among other similar activities. After the Japanese video game market began to \\"cool off\\" from the success of Taito's Space Invaders, a column in Weekly Asagi magazine named \\"Dekigotorogy\\" appeared, which ran a feature named \\"In Search of the next Space Invaders\\" based around the company visiting several different computer clubs across the country in search of potential games to topple the success of Space Invaders. After visiting the Toudai PC Club in the University of Tokyo and finding their game to be uninspiring, they soon visited the Theoretical Science Group only to have the same reaction. Over the course of two days, the group held meetings on the first floor of the student union building to brainstorm potential game ideas. The idea of the game was conceived by Tatsu Kawakami, beginning as a game themed around the player laying down traps in a house to catch cockroaches ‚Äî feeling that the idea gave the player too much free movement, it was revised to make the playfield resemble a Go board. The cockroaches were changed to aliens due to the film Alien premiering around the same time. The Go-like board was slightly tweaked to resemble a cityscape; after multiple real-world areas were suggested, such as Kyoto, Japan and San Francisco, California, the team ultimately decided to base it on the capital city of Heian-ky≈ç, with the player being changed to a Heian period police officer. The idea was submitted to Weekly Asagi, who published it in their column shortly after. Not wanting their idea to go to waste, the group began programming the game on an Apple II computer; however, it suffered from bad optimization and long load times. It was then reworked using the computer's low-resolution mode, which replaced all of the in-game graphics with colored blocks. After the idea for the game was published in Weekly Asagi, Japanese game studio Denki Onky≈ç expressed interest in it and had the group meet with them at their headquarters in ≈åta, Tokyo. Being presented with the corrected Apple II version, Denki approved of the game and hired the group to work for them and make it a full game ‚Äî prior to this, the Theoretical Science Group briefly visited Namco and Sega, who also expressed interest in the game. Development lasted for roughly three months. Programmers coded the game on a Z80 assembler, where another would take the code, burn it to a ROM board and test the program to make sure it worked. A candy power-up item that caused all aliens to stop moving for a brief moment of time, a homage to the Kuchisake- onna monster from Japanese folklore, was considered but later scrapped as it complicated the game's controls. A time limit was later added to prevent the game from going on forever, while the map was slightly modified to keep the game from becoming too boring. The player's death animation, depicting an angel floating up off the screen, was made as a last-minute addition by request from Denki. The game was originally subtitled Otoshiana Game, meaning \\"Pitfall Trap Game\\", which was cut later on. Heiankyo Alien was presented at the 1979 Amusement Machine Show held in the Harumi area of Ch≈´≈ç, Tokyo. The team discovered a bug during its presentation that caused a chunk of the maze to disappear if too many coins were inserted, which allowed enemies to escape the maze and scramble the game's data. Programmer Mitsutoshi Tabata recalls players attempting to memorize the patterns of the enemies. The game was released for arcades in Japan in November 1979, while a PC release was produced the same year. Reception Heiankyo Alien was widely successful when it was first released, being praised for its originality and element of strategy. The Japanese manga Game Center Arashi, which featured a story based on Heiankyo Alien, is believed to have attributed to the game's success due to its usage of terminology and strategies made by other players ‚Äî author Misuru Sugaya has stated that Heiankyo Alien remains his favorite game, and claims to play it regularly on his computer. The Game Boy release was more negatively received. In a 1998 retrospective review, Allgame criticized it for lacking replay value and \\"boring\\" concept. Related games=Arcade versions Many copied arcade versions of the game exist with differences in background color and sound effects. Taito Corporation produced a version with a light- blue background that recycled many sound effects from Head On. The unit's cabinet and instruction card were created specifically for the version by Taito, but it is not known whether the version was a licensed manufacture or a copy. H≈çei Sangy≈ç (now Banpresto) produced an arranged version called Time Alien where alien movements are much quicker (however, the game lags whenever the player tries to dig or fill up a hole). In 1980, a North American version titled Digger (unrelated to the Canadian computer game Digger) was created by Sega and Gremlin Industries, with minor changes in appearance. Ports Meldac released a Game Boy version of the game in Japan and North America in 1990. This port includes a remake version where a new type of alien appears to chase after the player's character. The game was also ported to the Super Famicom by Nihon Bussan in 1995 as Nichibutsu Arcade Classics 2: Heiankyo Alien. The company had previously released a licensed remake titled Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen. The game was also made available for the Microsoft Windows operating system in 1999 by Hyperware, and various mobile phone versions are available on i-mode, Vodafone live!, and EZweb. Influenced games Space Panic (1980) and its clones (e.g. Apple Panic) also feature trappable aliens while Lode Runners (1983) enemies are human guards. Doraemon Meiky≈´ Daisakusen (1989) and Boomer's Adventure in ASMIK World (1989) are later examples. The Commodore VIC-20 cartridge game Alien appears to be a direct clone of Heiankyo Alien.

Early life James Long was born in Culpeper County, Virginia, in 1793. He became a U.S. Army surgeon and served at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. He married Jane Herbert Dent Wilkinson Long in 1815,http://www.texas-settlement.org/markers/brazoria/64.html settled in Natchez, Mississippi after the war, and served as a doctor at Port Gibson. In 1817, Long owned a plantation in Vicksburg. Filibustering Many American and French settlers of the American South were opposed to the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty of 1819 that settled the border dispute between the United States and New Spain. It aroused such strong opposition in Natchez that prominent citizens planned a filibustering expedition to conquer Spanish Texas and placed Long in command. Long teamed up with Jos√© F√©lix Trespalacios, a Mexican who had escaped imprisonment for fomenting rebellion against Spanish rule in Mexico. The rhetoric surrounding their first expedition received a great deal of attention, and about 200 men including Jim Bowie and Ben Milam gathered in Natchez in early 1819 for the planned invasion of Texas. Long also attempted to recruit the French pirate Jean Lafitte and his men, but Lafitte turned him down. Several of Long's recruits were former French soldiers who had started and quickly abandoned a settlement in Texas known as the Champ d'Asile in 1818.Lieber, Francis, Wigglesworth, Edward Encyclop√¶dia Americana. 1851. p. 58. By June 1819, the so-called Long Expedition had arrived in Texas and successfully captured Nacogdoches. His followers proclaimed Long the first president of the new \\"Republic of Texas\\" (unrelated to the later Republic of Texas that was the result of the Texas Revolution), also called the \\"Long Republic\\". Despite this initial success, Long's independent republic lasted just four months. His army eventually grew restless and many men returned to the United States, and a Spanish expedition routed Long and his remaining followers in October 1819. Long escaped to Natchitoches, Louisiana. Undeterred by the Spanish presence, Long quickly began raising money to equip a second expedition to revitalize the failed republic. He joined refugees from the first expedition on the Bolivar Peninsula in April 1820, bringing his pregnant wife Jane and 300 troops. Though Long restored elements of the former government, the expedition stalled for more than a year as men began to desert. On October 4, 1821, Long and his troops seized Presidio La Bah√≠a, but Spanish troops forced the expedition to surrender four days later. Death Long was imprisoned for a time in San Antonio and in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n. He was transported to Mexico City in March 1822 to plead his case before Mexican President Agust√≠n de Iturbide, but on April 8, 1822, he was shot and killed by a guard. One of Long's followers, Benjamin Milam, believed that Trespalacios, who had been captured and freed, had bribed the guard to kill Long. Long's widow, Jane Long, claimed to be the first woman of English descent to settle in Texas. She gave birth to Mary James Long, said to be the first child born in Texas of English descent, a claim which has been disproved by census records from 1807 to 1826 which show a number of Anglo-American births. Throughout a long winter, she and her children struggled as she waited for her husband's return. At one point, several Karankawa Indians appeared but Long fired a cannon each day to make them think there was an army stationed there. Finally, during the spring, the news of her husband's death finally reached her. Jane Long left Texas but returned in the 1820s as a bona fide colonist.

Roosevelt as the head of the Foreign Economic Administration. Previously he had served as Alien Property Custodian and as chief of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Late in the 1930s, senior Washington officials discovered that Crowley had embezzled from his banks in Wisconsin in the 1920s and early 1930s. They covered it up. Biographer Stuart Weiss says, Crowley's is: :the darker story of the businessman as speculator and embezzler, whose fraud was covered up in Wisconsin and Washington....[in part it is] the morally complex and compelling story of Crowley as a bureaucrat and politician in Washington, administering multiple major agencies, often simultaneously;...but also deeply involved in conflicts of interest a later generation would find unacceptable and even incomprehensible.Weiss p. xii. Early life Leo Crowley was born to Thomas and Katie Crowley in Milton, Wisconsin, immigrants of Irish Catholic origin. He went to the University of Wisconsin. His father worked for the Milwaukee Road. Young Leo delivered groceries and saved his tips from customers. In 1905, with $1000 he bought a part of the General Paper Company, some of the products of which he had been bringing to customers. He worked hard to grow the company, and his share in it, until he owned it outright in 1919. That year he took over the T. S. Morris company with financing from Milo Hagen and W.D. Curtis. Selling stock in this company relieved its debt, and he bought a wholesale grocery for his brothers to run, and land in Madison, Wisconsin. Political life Crowley (center, 7th from left or right) in a meeting of Truman's cabinet (August 1945) Crowley began his entry into the political arena by supporting Albert G. Schmedeman for governor of Wisconsin. The biographer Weiss says \\"He managed Schmedeman as a parent might his children, and as he managed his family and most of the nurses at Saint Mary's Hospital.\\"Stuart L. Weiss (1996) The President's Man: Leo Crowley and Franklin Roosevelt in Peace and War, page 7, Southern Illinois University Press Crowley served as a delegate for Al Smith at the Democratic National Convention. He thus came in contact with Jouett Shouse and John J. Raskob, operatives for Al Smith. Progressivism was strong in Wisconsin, as expressed by Senator John J. Blaine and the newspaper Capital Times edited by William T. Evjue. Crowley was effective in bringing about a progressive-democratic alliance for the election of Franklin Roosevelt. It was the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), one of the most popular elements of the New Deal. The biographer Weiss tells of the incredible tale of how the nearly-bankrupt Crowley became the figurehead for banking security in a time of common bank runs. Crowley's special capacity for smoothing troubled waters drew him closer to FDR. A wartime cabinet-level conflict involving foreign economic operations in Europe and North Africa threatened cabinet solidarity. So Crowley became head of the Foreign Economic Administration in September 1943, with responsibility for Lend-Lease and Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., was promoted to Undersecretary of State. Crowley was now a cabinet member in the Roosevelt administration. The skeleton in Crowley's closet was his misappropriation of funds in 1931, early in the Great Depression. Though disguised, his banking misdeeds threatened to undo his place in political diplomacy, for instance years later when Henry Morgenthau, Jr. or Arthur Vandenberg were checking his credentials. His unusually close relations with the President and James F. Byrnes, as well as adroit personal moves, preserved him in office. He had received the Order of Saint Gregory the Great from Pope Pius XI in 1929.Knight of St. Gregory from Wisconsin Historical Society Crowley was an early target of I. F. Stone, whose investigations were republished by the Capital Times in Madison. Later life Back in the business world, Crowley was named chairman of the Milwaukee Road in December 1945 and made it turn a profit until the mid-1960s. He continued contact with the White House: President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Crowley to the United States Commission on Civil Rights in his second term, and he was known to have dined with Lyndon Johnson. Leo Crowley died on April 15, 1972 in a hospital in Madison, Wisconsin.Leo Crowley Dies, Was FDR Aide, Stevens Point Daily Journal, April 15, 1972, pg. 2 Very negatively for Crowley in 1955, Harry Truman wrote about how Crowley had caused a problem with the Russians when Germany was defeated. The episode was recounted by daughter Margaret Truman in 1973. She adds:Margaret Truman (1973) Harry S. Truman, page 255, Wm. Morrow & Company :...the real lesson was one that he hesitated to state in his memoirs ‚Äì the extreme hostility which certain men in government, such as Mr. Crowley, felt toward Russia. It did not make my father's task any easier, to find the middle path between these men and the Henry Wallace types, who could not believe the Russians were capable of any wrongdoing.

The hoax  In 1953, young Atlanta barbers Edward Watters and Tom Wilson, along with butcher Arnold Payne, took a dead rhesus monkey and removed its tail, applied large doses of hair remover and used green food coloring to make the corpse of the monkey appear abnormal. They then used a blow torch to create a burning circle in the pavement. On July 8, 1953 Officer Sherley Brown came across the scene by accident and was told by the hoaxers that they had seen many creatures just like it. They claimed that they had hit the dead one with their truck and the other creatures had left in their flying saucer, which is what caused the scorch marks. The prank was played at the height of UFO hysteria in the United States. As a result, the Atlanta Police Department received constant phone calls after news of the story broke, with multiple residents adamant they had seen the flying saucer that the pranksters described. The situation was propelled further when a veterinarian agreed that the animal was not from Earth. The United States Air Force was also called in to investigate.  Hoax revealed  The hoax was discovered hours after the event by Dr. Herman Jones and Emory University anatomy professor Dr. Marion Hines. They found that the anatomy of the creature was identical to that of a monkey and Hines is quoted as saying \\"If it came from Mars, they have monkeys on Mars.\\" Wilson, Payne and Watters eventually admitted to the hoax. Watters was made to pay a $40 fine \\"for obstructing a highway.\\"  Present day  The display at GBI. The Martian Monkey is now on display in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation mini-museum, along with other notable items, such as an illegal moonshine still and the fibers that solved the Atlanta child murders. The exhibit is showcased along with the news report that was published at the time.  In the media  Nate DiMeo retold this story in \\"Every Night Ever\\", episode 67 of his podcast 'The Memory Palace'.

His memoirs form an important source of information for historians of the period. Biography=Family life Goslinga married Jeanette (Joanne) Isabelle baroness thoe Schwartzenberg und Hohenlansberg, vrijvrouwe of Ameland, at Ballum, Friesland, on 12 June 1692. They had five daughters, one of whom, Anna Dodonea, would marry Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer. Career After studies at the University of Franeker and the University of Utrecht he became Grietman of Franekeradeel in 1688, a function he would hold until his death. This made him a regent and put him in line for all kinds of functions on a provincial level in the province of Friesland. He also represented that province in the States-General and in the Raad van State (Council of State) on many occasions (see \\"List of functions\\" in the External links). As a member of the Council of State (which was the most important executive organ of the Republic in the military field, especially after the Second Stadtholderless Period had started) he became a gedeputeerde te velde for Friesland at the headquarters of the Duke of Marlborough from 1706 until the Duke's dismissal in 1711. As such he was charged with advising the Duke, and with keeping an eye on him, as agreed when Marlborough was made lieutenant-captain-general of the army of the Republic in 1702. The Dutch deputies-in-the-field had the right to veto the Duke's tactical decisions if they thought the interests of the Republic demanded it, and this had led to much friction with Marlborough in previous years. Goslinga, however, proved cooperative generally and managed to provide a positive contribution during the battles of Ramillies, Oudenaarde, and Malplaquet. Though not a general, he was authorized to give orders to Dutch commanders at these battles. At the Battle of Oudenaarde he took it upon himself to throw a Dutch division into battle at a decisive moment.Frey Another incident had him personally ordering up reinforcements at the battle of Malplaquet, when the second Dutch assault on the left flank faltered.Churchill, pp. 608-610 To illustrate the good rapport between the Duke and Goslinga, Churchill mentions the anecdote in which they shared the Duke's cloak to sleep on after the battle of Ramillies.Churchill, p. 118 Though Churchill has no high opinion of Goslinga's military abilitiesChurchill, p. 84 he nevertheless extensively used his memoirs as a source. Goslinga served as plenipotentiary for the Republic at the peace negotiations, leading up to the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). After the conclusion of the peace he served as extraordinary envoy of the Republic to the court of Louis XIV of France in 1714 and 1715. In 1728 he represented the Republic at the congress of Soissons about outstanding European diplomatic issues (like the status of Gibraltar). Until his death he was involved in Dutch politics. He supported the appointment of William IV, Prince of Orange as stadtholder of Groningen in 1719.

Designed by Frederick and Edward Baumann it was built between 1873-1874 in the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on January 14, 1997. When completed, Washington Block was one of the tallest buildings in the city of Chicago and is described as a rare example of the \\"isolated pier foundation\\" (see below) which contributed to the foundation of knowledge that has made Chicago the birthplace of the skyscraper. The building has limestone facades and originally included an exterior staircase that led to a second-floor corner entrance. The lobby has a curving hardwood staircase. Today the first floor is occupied by a 7-Eleven and the second floor occupied by Carter Legal Group PC. The building, which is located at the corner of North Wells Street and West Washington Street is five stories tall. The building was originally intended to host upscale offices for companies wanting to be close to the nearby then-blossoming LaSalle Street financial district. However, when the Chicago 'L' was built next to the building, the upscale commercial customer found the building undesirable. During the mid 1900s, the owner hammered off ground-level architectural details in order to modernize the storefronts. 21st century owners have recast some of the details during a restoration. The isolated pier technique uses several separate foundations, one at each of the load-bearing points underground. Thus, instead of using a single foundation that would crack as the building shifted on sandy soil, a building may be built on a much longer-lasting and sturdier foundation. The Washington Block's foundation enabled it to be built on soft, compressible soil, instead of the solid bedrock formerly seen as a requirement. This ability allowed skyscrapers to be built in places like Chicago, and many of them were.

The incumbent, Willie Brown, was termed out of office and could not seek a third term. The general election included three top candidates including then Supervisor Gavin Newsom and then president of the board of supervisors, Matt Gonzalez and former supervisor Angela Alioto. No candidate received the required majority, so the race went into a run-off of the two top candidates, which were Gavin Newsom and Matt Gonzalez. The run-off occurred on December 9, 2003, where Gavin Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco. Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, though most candidates in San Francisco do receive funding and support from various political parties. In 2003, then-supervisor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, ran in a large field of challengers, including Board of Supervisors President Matt Gonzalez, Supervisor Tom Ammiano, former supervisor Angela Alioto, city treasurer Susan Leal, and former police chief Tony Ribera. Newsom and Gonzalez took first and second place, respectively, but neither won a majority, so the two advanced to a runoff election. Third party advocates saw it as a chance to dethrone the Democratic Party.http://www.counterpunch.org/anderson12062003.html Newsom ran as a moderate against leftist/progressive Gonzalez, a member of the Green Party. It was the first mayoral election in San Francisco that a Green Party candidate took a noticeable amount of the vote. The election was close, with Gonzalez leading in the polls and winning the popular vote among ballots cast on election day, while Newsom had a larger lead on absentee ballots.

He attended Washington State University where he played college baseball for the Cougars from 1993-1996, and was drafted by the Diamondbacks in the 26th round (785th overall pick) of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed with the Diamondbacks two days later on June 6. Ryan, who batted and threw left-handed, was listed at 5' 11\\" in height, and 192 lb in weight. Major league career=Debut Ryan made his major league debut on August 20, with the Diamondbacks against the Pittsburgh Pirates. They were playing at Three Rivers Stadium, with 23,934 people attending the game. In the top of the seventh inning, Ryan was asked to pinch hit for pitcher Greg Swindell, batting ninth. With runners on first and third base, Pirates pitcher Marc Wilkins balked in Ryan's first at-bat, which made all the players on base advance to the next base as a result, with the runner on third, Steve Finley, scoring a run for the Diamondbacks. Ryan ultimately grounded out, second to first, on his at-bat. In the bottom of the seventh, pitcher Dan Plesac was called to replace Ryan, pitching and batting ninth. The Diamondbacks lost the game by the score of 5-4. Career after debut On June 19, , Ryan was traded by the Diamondbacks to the Oakland Athletics for Ryan Christenson. He played his last major league game on October 7 of that year. One year and two days after being traded, on July 21, 2002, Ryan was purchased by the Boston Red Sox from the Athletics. From this point, Ryan was signed, released, or granted free agency multiple times for about the next three years. Ryan was then granted free agency on September 30, 2002. On November 18, he signed as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays. On June 19, 2003, the Blue Jays released Ryan, who was signed three days later on June 22, this time by the San Francisco Giants as a free agent. He was granted free agency again on October 15. The Houston Astros signed Ryan as a free agent on February 5, 2004. On June 18, he was yet again granted free agency, just to be signed almost a month later by the Florida Marlins as a free agent on July 19. On October 15, Ryan was granted free agency, and was signed again with the Marlins as a free agent on November 11 after the season ended.

Rajendravarman II was the uncle and first cousin of Harshavarman. His principal monuments, located in the Angkor region of Cambodia's Siem Reap province, are Pre Rup and East Mebon.Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., The king claimed links to the royal line of the Chenla state that had its capital at Bhavapura (the city's location is debated) and predates the start of the Khmer empire in 802 AD. Inscriptions say that the Khmer empire under his tutelage extended to southern Vietnam, Laos and much of Thailand and as far north as southern China. An inscription at Pre Rup relates that Rajendravarman II was a great warrior, his sword frequently blood-stained, his body as hard as a diamond. Though the king punished the guilty, the inscription says, he had an ocean of compassion for the innocent. Other inscriptions depict him as organizer of state religious ritual. In one text, he gives an order for the collection of holy oil, in the form of butter, for use in temples. The king ruled from a great palace designed by his minister Kavindrarimathana. Many scholars believe that Rajendravarman II instituted a system of centralized administration, establishing more direct control over a collection of princes who had been largely independent at their estates in the provinces. Construction at Banteay Srei, the ornate temple of pink sandstone located north of the main Angkor complex, began during the king's reign.

It is located in the northern section of the district of St. Vital, and is bounded to the north by the Red River, to the east by St. Mary's Road, to the south by Fermor Avenue, and to the west by Dunkirk Drive. As of the 2016 census, Elm Park had a population of 1,715. History St. Mark's Anglican Church in Elm Park The neighbourhoods of Elm Park and Kingston Crescent (located to the west of Dunkirk Drive) were originally a park founded by Albert William Austin's Winnipeg Street Railway Company in 1890. The trolley company had recently extended a line to just north of the Red River along what is now Osborne Street; by founding Elm Park directly across the river from the end of the trolley line, Austin hoped to increase off-peak and weekend use of the line. The trolley company built a pontoon bridge for foot traffic, and Elm Park soon became a popular summertime destination for Winnipeg residents. The St. Vital Fire Hall in Elm Park sheltered evacuees during the 1950 Red River Flood, and is still used as a working fire hall and as a museum.The popularity of Elm Park waned in the 1910s. It closed in approximately 1912 when the pontoon bridge was replaced by a steel truss bridge. Eventually the lands to the east of Dunkirk Drive were bought by the City of St. Vital; the new neighbourhood was named Elm Park after the former park. Although most of the land in the east of the new neighbourhood was converted into single-family housing (with some apartment buildings along St. Mary's Road), most of the land in the southwest corner was converted into the home of the Winnipeg Canoe Club, eventually becoming a private golf course. There are also three small public parks remaining of what was once Elm Park: Dean Finlay Park on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Killarney Street, Carey Park on Elm Park Road, and St. Vital Memorial Park on Fermor Avenue. Many of the older oak, ash, elm, and cottonwood trees were retained during development and line the streets of the current subdivision. Many buildings in Elm Park were damaged by the 1950 Red River Flood. The neighbourhood was one of the worst hit areas in the city.Review of Historic Flood Data from the Red River Floodway Authority.

He also played in the American Professional Soccer League and USISL and was a 1989 Division I First-Team All-American. Youth Wylie attended Ridgefield High School in Ridgefield, Connecticut before entering the University of Vermont. In Vermont, he played on the soccer team from 1986 to 1989, earning first team All American recognition in 1989. While he began as a forward, by his junior season, he has moved to sweeper. In 1990, he left school to pursue his professional career, but returned to graduate in 1991. He was inducted into the University of Vermont Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.Vermont University Hall of Fame Professional In 1990, Wylie spent one season with the New Mexico Chiles of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). Wylie then returned to Vermont to complete his education. At this point, Wylie‚Äôs career becomes vague. His Vermont Hall of Fame bio states that he played for the New Mexico Chiles from 1991 to 1993. However, the Chiles lasted only the 1990 season. In 1991, the New Mexico Roadrunners were renamed the Chiles, but Wylie is not listed on any of their rosters from 1991 to 1996. His Hall of Fame bio states that Wylie returned to the northeast after the 1993 season to play for the Cape Cod Crusaders of the USISL. That matches with the founding of the Crusaders in 1994. In May 1996, Wylie completed a successful trial with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. He played twenty-two games that season before being released. He then began the 1997 season with the Crusaders before being called up to the Revs for nine games. New England waived him on May 29, 1997 and he finished the season with the Vermont Wanderers. The Wanderers were sold at the end of the season and the new ownership renamed the team the Vermont Voltage. Wylie signed with the Voltage on February 8, 1998, but left the team during the preseason. At this point, Wylie‚Äôs career again becomes difficult to follow. It appears that he moved to Boston in the spring of 1998 with a mention that he may have played for the Boston Bulldogs. However, other records show him playing for the Crusadars in 1998 and 1999.

This lineage is most diverse in the Northern Hemisphere. Until recently the subfamily Necydalinae was included within the lepturines, but this has been recently recognized as a separate subfamily. Nine tribes are usually recognized today, with a tenth, Caraphiini, created in 2016. A few genera are of uncertain placement within the subfamily. Usually among the smaller members of their family, these beetles are of a slender shape - particularly the thorax is markedly less wide than the wings, while the elytra tips are often pointed. They differ from most other longhorn beetles in that the antennae are not directly adjacent to the compound eyes. Hence, the latter are generally oval in outline, rather than having an indentation where the antennae originate, or even being divided by them. In addition, sexual dichromatism is not infrequently seen in lepturines; usually, longhorn beetles are not dimorphic or only have longer antennae in males. Tribes and genera Lepturinae contains the following genera: Desmocerus californicus Xylosteus spinolae Grammoptera ruficornis Tribe Caraphiini * Caraphia Matsushita 1933 Noctileptura Chemsak & Linsley, 1984 Tribe Desmocerini Blanchard, 1845 * Desmocerus Dejean 1821 Tribe Encyclopini LeConte, 1873 * Encyclops Newman 1838 * Leptalia LeConte 1873 Tribe Lepturini Latreille, 1802 * Alosternida Podany 1961 * Analeptura Linsley & Chemsak 1976 * Anastrangalia Ohbayashi 1963 * Anoplodera Pic 1901 * Bellamira LeConte 1873 * Brachyleptura Casey 1913 * Cerrostrangalia Hovore & Chemsak 2005 * Charisalia Casey 1913 * Chontalia Bates 1872 * Choriolaus Bates 1885 * Cosmosalia * Cyphonotida Casey 1913 * Dorcasina Casey 1913 * Etorofus Matsushita 1933 * Eurylemma Chemsak & Linsley 1974 * Euryptera Lepeletier & Audinet-Serville in Latreille 1828 * Fortuneleptura Villiers 1979 * Grammoptera Audinet-Serville 1835 * Idiopidonia Swaine & Hopping 1928 * Judolia Mulsant 1863 * Leptochoriolaus Chemsak & Linsley 1976 * Leptura Linnaeus 1758 * Lepturobosca (Cosmosalia) Casey 1913 * Lepturopsis Linsley & Chemsak 1976 * Lycidocerus Chemsak & Linsley 1976 * Lycochoriolaus Linsley & Chemsak 1976 * Lycomorphoides Linsley 1970 * Lygistopteroides Linsley & Chemsak 1971 * Macrochoriolaus Linsley 1970 * Megachoriolaus Linsley 1970 * Meloemorpha Chemsak & Linsley 1976 * Mimiptera Linsley 1961 * Mordellistenomimus Chemsak & Linsley 1976 * Nemognathomimus Chemsak & Linsley 1976 * Neoalosterna Podany 1961 * Neobellamira Swaine & Hopping 1928 * Neoleptura Thomson 1860 * Orthochoriolaus Linsley & Chemsak 1976 * Ortholeptura Casey 1913 * Pachytodes Pic 1891 * Pseudophistomis Linsley & Chemsak 1971 * Pseudostrangalia Swaine & Hopping 1928 * Pseudotypocerus Linsley & Chemsak 1971 * Pygoleptura Linsley & Chemsak 1976 * Stenelytrana Dejean 1837 * Stenostrophia Casey 1913 * Stenurella Rosenhauer, 1856 * Stictoleptura Casey 1924 * Strangalepta Casey 1913 * Strangalia Dejean 1835 * Strangalidium Giesbert 1997 * Strophiona Casey 1913 * Toxoleptura Miroshnikov 1998 * Trachysida Casey 1913 * Trigonarthris Haldeman 1847 * Trypogeus Lacordaire, 1869 * Typocerus LeConte 1850 * Xestoleptura Casey 1913 Tribe Oxymirini Danilevsky, 1997 * Neoxymirus Miroshnikov 2013 * Oxymirus Mulsant 1862 Tribe Rhagiini Kirby, 1837 * Acmaeops LeConte 1850 * Acmaeopsoides Linsley & Chemsak 1976 * Akimerus Audinet-Serville, 1835 * Anthophylax LeConte 1850 * Apiocephalus Gahan, 1898 * Brachysomida Casey 1913 * Brachyta Fairmaire 1868 * Centrodera LeConte 1850 * Comacmaeops Linsley & Chemsak 1972 * Cortodera Mulsant 1863 * Enoploderes LeConte 1862 * Evodinus LeConte 1850 * Gaurotes LeConte 1850 * Metacmaeops Linsley & Chemsak 1972 * Neanthophylax Linsley & Chemsak 1972 * Pachyta Dejean 1821 * Pidonia Thomson 1864 * Piodes LeConte 1850 * Pseudogaurotina Plavilstshikov 1958 * Rhagium Fabricius 1775 * Stenocorus Reitter 1912 * Tomentgaurotes Podany 1962 Tribe Rhamnusiini Sama, 2009 * Neorhamnusium Hayashi 1976 * Rhamnusium Latreille 1829 Tribe Sachalinobiini Danilevsky, 2010 * Sachalinobia Tribe Teledapini Pascoe, 1871Tribe Xylosteini Reitter, 1913 * Leptorhabdium Kraatz 1879 * Pseudoxylosteus Sama 1993 Incertae sedis * ‚Ä†Leptura longipennis (nomen dubium; does not belong to Leptura) References * * Category:Cerambycidae Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Lepturinae"},{"id":"18670135","text":"John Miles Walker (December 11, 1896 ‚Äì August 19, 1976) was a Major League Baseball first baseman and catcher.

Olson Park and Waterfall was a heavily visited park and waterfall complex that was located in the Avondale community area of Chicago. It was built by Walter E. Olson, the owner of the Olson Rug Company, next to his factory and headquarters on the northwest corner of Diversey and Pulaski, and was a popular landmark for Chicago families. Built during the Great Depression the park was open to the public until it was closed in 1971 after Marshall Field bought the complex in 1965. The Chicago Tribune named Olson Park as the first of \\"Chicago's Seven Lost Wonders\\". The park's opening was famous for the fact that during its opening, the park was symbolically \\"deeded\\" back to Native Americans, observing the hundred year anniversary of the expulsion of Indians across the Mississippi River after the Blackhawk War. Today the site is occupied by a parking lot for the former Olson Rug factory and headquarters which is now occupied by the retailer Macy's.

It is a popular recreation area both in the summer and in the winter.http://www.utah.com/schmerker/2000/millcreek_canyon.htm It was named by Brigham Young on August 22, 1847 before all of the mills that were built in and below the densely forested canyon. It is home to two restaurants and six Boy Scout Day Camps. Millcreek Canyon is next to Parley's Canyon on the north and Big Cottonwood Canyon on the south. Though perhaps the most accessible canyon to Salt Lake City, its upper reaches are much less visited than neighboring canyons. Recreation in Millcreek=Biking The upper trails in Millcreek Canyon (those above the winter gate, which is located at the Maple Grove picnic area) are open to biking on even-numbered days only. Bikes are allowed on the lower trails on all days. When riding on the road, bicycles are subject to the same laws as motor vehicles, including signalling before a turn and stopping at stop signs. For more information please consult the website http://RoadRespect.Utah.gov. Dogs Dogs are allowed in Millcreek canyon every day. They may be off leash on hiking trails on odd numbered days (1st of the month, 3rd of the month, etc.), but must still be leashed in all developed areas, including the road, trail heads, and picnic areas. On even numbered days dogs must always be leashed in all areas, including all hiking trails. When the ski trail along the road in the upper canyon is groomed it is regulated as a trail and dogs may be off leash there on odd-numbered days. However, when the trail is not being groomed/maintained (e.g. before it has snowed) it is considered a service road, even though it is closed to vehicles, and dogs must be leashed. Dog owners are required to pick up after their dogs. There are receptacles for dog waste in several places in the canyon, including both upper and lower Big Water trailheads. Hiking Millcreek Canyon has a variety of trails for hiking. Difficulty ranges from easy (beginner) to difficult (advanced). Popular trails include: Pipeline Trail is popular for kids or beginning hikers. It can be accessed from multiple points (Rattlesnake, Church Fork, Burch Hollow and Elbow Fork Trailheads).

Heine was born in Hanover. Penniless, he came to Hamburg in 1784 and in the following years acquired sizeable assets. It was common knowledge at the time that he was benefactor and patron to his nephew Heinrich Heine. Because of his wealth ‚Äì by the time of his death his estate was worth an estimated ‚Ç¨ 110 million ‚Äì he was called \\"Rothschild of Hamburg\\", in allusion to the Rothschild banking family. Life Heine learned the trade of banking at Bankhaus Popert in Hamburg. Subsequently he started his own business as a draft broker, cooperating closely with Emanuel Anton von Halle. In 1797, together with Marcus Abraham Heckscher (1770‚Äì1823), he founded the Heckscher & Co. merchant bank. In 1818, now being the sole executive director, he changed the company's name to Bankhaus Salomon Heine. During the following years he rose to becoming one of Hamburg's most successful bankers of the time. Promoter of poet Heinrich Heine Salomon Heine let young Heinrich Heine work and learn at his Hamburg bank Heckscher & Co. and eventually offered Heinrich a position with the cloth company Harry Heine & Comp. Heinrich though, who had fallen in love with Salomon's daughter Amalie, devoted himself chiefly to poetry and took very little interest in business. Soon he had to declare bankruptcy. Salomon Heine was angered by his nephew choosing poetry as a way of life, in which he himself saw no money. His disapproval became apparent in the dictum: \\"H√§tt er gelernt was Rechtes, m√ºsst er nicht schreiben B√ºcher (Had he learned something proper he needed not write books).\\" Nonetheless, Salomon paid for Heinrich's studies in Jurisprudence and until his death he regularly granted Heinrich financial aid. Benefactor of Hamburg Salomon Heine's bounty and his position as benefactor are traded by an anecdote: emissaries from a religious order who intended to build a hospital were asking wealthy Hamburg residents for donations. The order was then told to first contact the Jewish banker Heine, the people would donate the same amount as Heine plus one additional Thaler. The friars told Heine of the merchants' reaction and he let them name the price of the hospital's construction. Heine paid exactly one half, so the other businessmen, bound by their words, were obliged to finance the rest. Moreover, Heine worked in Hamburg for the rest of his life. After the disastrous Great Fire of Hamburg in 1842 he participated in the city's reconstruction with his private assets. Additionally, he founded the Israelite Hospital of Hamburg in remembrance of his wife Betty who had died in 1837. Heinrich Heine lauded his uncle's foundation in the form of a poem, \\"Das neue israelitische Hospital zu Hamburg\\", which was published in the volume \\"Neue Gedichte\\". What Heine as a personality meant for Hamburg was most clearly shown though at his funeral. It turned into a demonstration of connecting popularity: thousands of people, Jews as well as Christians, spontaneously accompanied Heine on his last journey to the Ottensen Jewish cemetery.
