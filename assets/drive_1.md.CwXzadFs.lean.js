A single example was built and flown in 1959. Design and development In 1949, Joseph Kovács, a Hungarian-born aircraft engineer working at the Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnologicas (IPT - Institute of Technical Research) of the University of São Paulo proposed to design and build an experimental high performance light aircraft powered by a surplus Hirth HM 506 engine that had been imported into Brazil before the Second World War for use in an unbuilt aircraft design. The IPT, however, was busy on other projects, and so did not back Kovács' proposed design. Kovács, with fellow IPT engineer Sylvio de Oliveira, started construction of the design, named \\"Surubim\\" (little devil), in a rented workshop. The Surubim was a low-winged monoplane with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage of all wooden construction with plywood skinning, using Brazilian Pine and Freijo, two indigenous woods. The wings were fitted with trailing edge flaps and fixed leading edge slots. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit. When Kovács left IPT in 1951, de Oliveira continued work on the prototype, which was acquired by the IPT in 1953 for use as a flying test bed, gaining the designation IPT-16. Construction of the prototype continued at a slow pace, with the prototype being shown at an exhibition in São Paulo in 1956, but remained unflown for several more years. Operational history The IPT-16 finally made its maiden flight on 17 September 1959. Despite being underpowered and using a fixed pitch wooden propeller, performance was good, reaching a level speed of and in a dive. It was used by the IPT for three years, after which it was transferred to the Rio Clara City Aero Club for use as an aerobatic aircraft, where it remained in use until at least 1977. It was presented to the Museu Aeroespacial at Rio de Janeiro in 1988, where, after restoration, it was put on display.

Jack Webber (1907-1940) was a Welsh spiritualist medium. Webber worked as a miner in Loughor, Swansea and was introduced to spiritualism by his wife. He claimed his own mediumistic abilities such as levitation of objects, ectoplasm, psychokinesis and communicating with spirit voices.Jack Webber (1907-1940) Webber claimed his spirit guides were 'Paddy' and 'Reuben'. Webber was not scientifically tested by the Society for Psychical Research and some researchers have speculated that he performed his phenomena through trickery. During séances infra-red flashlight photographs were taken of his phenomena which spiritualist writers have claimed is evidence for spirit communication, however, skeptics have written the ectoplasm in the photographs resembles cheesecloth or gauze. According to the magician Julien Proskauer the floating trumpet of Webber was a trick. Close examination of photographs reveal Webber to be holding a telescopic reaching rod attached to the trumpet, and sitters in his séances only believed it to have levitated because the room was so dark they could not see the rod. Webber would cover the rod with crepe paper as ectoplasm to disguise its real construction. During the séances of Webber \\"spirit\\" voices were heard and the psychical researcher Hereward Carrington speculated that the voices were a trick performed by the medium himself by attaching a trumpet to the end of a telescopic reaching rod or a rubber tube. \\"In the vast majority of cases, the trumpet talking is done by the medium himself. If the séance is in the dark, the medium’s task is an easy one, he having only to wave the trumpet about and imitate whatever voices he desires. By attaching a trumpet to the end of the telescopic rod... and moving this about, voices can be made to appear in various parts of the room at will. Sometimes the trumpet is partly in sight, when the room is only partially darkened, and yet the voices come. This is accomplished by a small piece of rubber tubing being attached to the mouth of the horn, and the medium speaks into the other end of this tube. The voice appears to issue from the horn. At other times the medium employs a second trumpet, speaking into that, and it is almost impossible to distinguish the difference by locating the sound. At other times the medium consents to be held by two sitters while the horn is doing the talking. When this is the case, the medium generally has a confederate, who manipulates the horn, does the talking, etc.\\" The spiritual writer Harry Edwards supported the mediumship of Webber and included the photographs in his book The Mediumship of Jack Webber. The book was heavily criticized by the psychical researcher Michael Coleman who wrote \\"Edwards's book is essentially anecdotal, written from memory, often long after the events described. Thus we do not know where, when or for how long the individual sittings were held. We do not know how many sitters were present at each sitting, and we know the names of very few of them. But most importantly, we do not have those detailed sequences of events, with timings, that are necessary to arrive at a realistic assessment of any supposedly paranormal occurrences. Most of Edwards's account is unsupported by any independent witnesses\\".Coleman, Michael (1998). Letter to the Editor. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. Volume 62: 372-374.

Biography  Semen Bublyk was born in the village of Kapustyntsi, today within the Yahotyn Raion of Kyiv oblast, Ukraine. His father, Pavlo Fedotovych Bublyk, was a tailor of Ukrainian Cossack origin and Orthodox faith. His forefathers were serfs of Count Pyotr Rumyantsev. Descendant of old Ukrainian Cossack family, which like many common Christian people of the region were enslaved in the 18th century but preserved belief that real Cossacks are free people by the will of God. He supported the struggle under the red banners on the territory of Ukraine and former Russian Empire in 1917–1923 years, which resulted in creation of Soviet Union. Bublyk had five brothers, all of them can be classified as Red Cossacks, supporters and defenders of the Soviet ideology under red banners in some or other way: the social activist and registry Red Cossack Kuzma Bublyk (1901–1925), Danylo Bublyk, in 1938–1940 officer of the NKVD, cavalry and communications officer Vasyl Bublyk,http://podvig-naroda.ru Ivan Bublyk, officer of SMERSHhttp://podvig-naroda.ru during World War II and village teacher Yakiv Pavlovych Bublyk (1905-1999). During his childhood and youth as many young people of his generation he supported the Soviet ideology and restructuring of society expressed by Soviet communist worldview. The 1930s were the period of big troubles for people of Ukraine and Soviet Union caused by Great Famine and preparation for war with uprising fascism but also period of active social development in economic, cultural and social security spheres. Semen like many people of his generation was witness of this processes. From 1941 to 1945, Bublyk fought in the Great Patriotic war as a military engineer. In 1944 he was awarded the Order of the Red Star for his participation in the Vistula–Oder Offensive.http://podvig-naroda.ru and in 1945 he among other soldiers took part in the capture of Berlin. War made not so good impact on his health, because he was wounded many times and those old wounds later gave him troubles during all his life. Before World War II Bublyk graduated from the Agricultural University in Kiev. After the War he then became a professor and worked there for many years. During his lectures he taught in the Ukrainian language because he thought that Ukrainian high school need native Ukrainian language to be taught with, not only Russian.

A pioneer unit, the battalion undertook both infantry and engineer tasks. Despite being raised early in the war, the battalion did not see action until the final months, taking part in the Borneo campaign where, as part of the 1st Beach Group, it fought against the Japanese in support of the 9th Division. It was disbanded in early 1946 following the end of hostilities. History Formed in February 1941 at Greta, New South Wales, the 2/4th Pioneer Battalion was one of four pioneer battalions raised to provide engineer support to the 2nd Australian Imperial Force’s four infantry divisions. Trained as infantry, the battalion undertook both the infantry and engineer support roles and was organised along conventional infantry lines with a headquarters and four companies, but was made up of personnel with trade or practical skills, and within the divisional structure, the pioneers were administered as corps troops under the direction of the divisional engineer commander. Allocated to the 23rd Brigade of the 8th Division, after initial training it was sent north to Darwin in September to construct defences around the Adelaide River and Noonamah amidst concerns about Japanese intentions in the Pacific. While most of the division deployed to Malaya, the 2/4th remained behind and following the Japanese entry into the war, the battalion was allocated to bolster the garrison at Koepang as part of Sparrow Force on Timor. An advanced party was sent to the island in early February 1942, and on 14 February the rest of the battalion followed; however, the convoy in which they were embarked was attacked by Japanese aircraft and it was turned back. Returning to Darwin, the majority of the 2/4th’s equipment was lost when the ship carrying it was sunk in Darwin harbour during a Japanese air attack on 19 February. Consequently, the battalion’s deployment was cancelled and it remained in the north for more than a year, during which time they undertook defensive duties to counter the threat of Japanese invasion. During this time, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John McCarty. In November 1942, the battalion was reassigned to the 3rd Brigade, a Militia formation that had been mobilised for full-time service and sent to the Northern Territory earlier in the year to bolster the field force there. In March 1943, the strategic situation had improved and the pioneers were relieved of garrison duties, moving to the Atherton Tablelands where the 2nd AIF divisions were converted to the jungle division establishment as the Army prepared to go on the offensive in New Guinea. The battalion remained there throughout 1943 and the following year it was assigned to the 1st Beach Group, which had been raised to provide support to amphibious operations. In mid-1945, the battalion finally went into action. In June that year, as part of one of the final Australian operations of the war, the battalion landed on Labuan as part of the Operation Oboe landings in Borneo, assigned to support the 9th Division. Serving in the terminal support role around the beachhead, the 2/4th saw limited combat and its casualties during the fighting on Borneo were light with only five men being killed in battle. The majority of these were suffered during a raid on the Australian beachhead by 50 Japanese soldiers on 21 June. Following the conclusion of hostilities in August 1945, the battalion remained in the Kuching area where it undertook garrison duties maintaining law and order and processing Japanese prisoners of war for return to Japan, before returning to Australia in December. As the demobilisation process began, the battalion’s personnel were transferred for further service or discharged and it was eventually disbanded in early 1946. For its service during the war, the 2/4th received two battle honours: South-West Pacific 1945 and Borneo. Nineteen men were killed in action or died on active service while serving with the battalion and three were wounded; two members of the battalion were decorated with a Mention in Despatches. After the war, the pioneer role was assumed as a specialisation within the conventional infantry establishment within the Australian Army, and consequently the wartime pioneer battalions have not been re-raised.

Emblem of Hoholiv Hoholiv is a former Cossack town, and present day village, in Brovary Raion, Kyiv oblast of Ukraine.  History  Some historians trace the origins of the town to the town Nosov on the river Rud, mentioned in ancient Russian chronicles of about 1148 CE.  17th to 19th centuries  Intensive development of the town began from the beginning of the 17th century, when it was mentioned in the sources of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth under the name Chocholiw. At that time it was big free Cossack town situated on the trade roots near Kyiv. In 1649 Hoholiv Cossack sotnia (military troop of hundred men) was formed to fight for freedom and civil liberties in Cossack army of Bohdan Khmelnytsky. After the incorporation of the lands of Cossack Hetmanate into the Muscovy in the second half of 17th century chronicles of that period mention Cossack insurgency against czarist government of that time near the village. A lot of people were killed by troops of the Muscovite Army who oppressed the insurgents. During 17th to 19th centuries the town was part of the Russian Empire. Almost all citizens were registered as the imperial registry as Cossacks - that is more free than enslaved Cossack-peasants, which constituted the majority of the Ukrainian population at that time.  20th century  After dissolution of the Russian Empire, the Russian civil war in 1917-23 and creation of the Soviet Ukraine, Hoholiv lost its status as a town and became a village. 21st century  Modern people of village community preserve the memory of their forefathers Cossacks, free people by the will of God, people who made great impact to the development of the region, and gave names to most part of its towns and villages.

Xiaoxiang poetry is one of the Classical Chinese poetry genres, one which has been practiced for over a thousand years. It is a poetry of scenic wonders, a poetry of officials exiled for their views and beliefs, and a poetry of dissent against submitting to government control. Xiaoxiang poetry is geographically associated with the Xiaoxiang region, around and south of Dongting Lake. The Xiaoxiang genre of literature is often associated with similarly themed Chinese calligraphy and Chinese painting. Famous poets in this genre include Qu Yuan, Song Yu, Jia Yi, Wang Yi, Yu Xin, Shen Quanqi, Zhang Yue, Li Bai, Du Fu, Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, and Su Shi. Name Xiaoxiang appears as a name with various spellings and transcriptions, such as: (), also transliterated XiaoXiang. Xiao-Xiang, Hsiao Hsiang, and Chiu Chiang, in some older sources. Poems written according to various of the Classical Chinese poetry forms may be considered to be Xiaoxiang poetry genre. Xiaoxiang region Map showing various lakes and rivers in the Xiaoxiang region, including the Xiao and Xiang Rivers The Xiaoxiang poetry genre is symbolically oriented around a certain geographic region, known as the Xiaoxiang, more-or- less modern Hunan Province. \\"Xiaoxiang\\" refers to the \\"lakes and rivers\\" region in south-central China south of the middle-reaches of the Yangtze River and more-or-less corresponding with Hunan province: it is less a precise geographic entity than a concept: :XiaoXiang poetry is not just about a place; it is also about giving subtle expression to discontent. The Xiaoxiang region was a typical place of exile for the poet-officials of numerous Chinese dynasties, from the 3rd century BCE, or earlier. Although not allowed to necessarily speak their mind about their feelings in this regard, on penalty of further punishment, many of the exiles felt that the exile was unjustified and that they were being punished unjustly for performing their duties according to their sense of conscience. The sense of punishment was a complex of various factors: generally the exiles continued on serving as governmental officials, but receiving a demotion in status and a decrease in salary; the geographic distance and terrain made travel between the Xiaoxiang and the Central Plains regions of China onerous, dangerous and lengthy; the Xiaoxiang exiles were denied direct contact with the sophisticated, urban society of the imperial capital, having to adapt to different customs, dialects, or languages of the region, and for the most part denied direct association with their peers; the climate was hotter and more humid than they were accustomed to, and the fear of associated disease made many of the exiles to the Xiaoxiang area complain about the huge risk to their life and health involved, something which known cases of exiles succumbing to illness shortly after being posted there did little to dispel. The complaints about the region generally found a balanced tension in the Xiaoxiang poetry with the hopes for a pardon for the crimes for which they had been convicted, or a reprieve of their sentences, and especially for the recall back home. Mythology Even before the beginnings of modern recorded history, the Xiaoxiang region was the part of a rich cultural tradition, including shamanic religious traditions and mythology. Reference to this tradition is a part of the Xiaoxiang poetry. References are made to Shun (also known as Chong Hua)Davis, 83 and to the Xiang River goddesses. Although he is generally considered historical to some extent, other references frequently involve the mythology surrounding Qu Yuan. History The Xiaoxiang poetry tradition begins with Qu Yuan, of the Kingdom of Chu, before the initial unification of China into an empire. Further development continued on through the Han Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty and the Tang poetry, and on into the times of the Song Dynasty and the Song poetry. With such exponents as Du Fu and Su Shi, the Xiaoxiang genre of poetry continued as a vigorous source of inspiration for Chinese poetry and contribution to culture. Qu Yuan and Chuci The Xiaoxiang poetry tradition begins with the Chuci tradition, which was associated with Qu Yuan's exile, in the centuries before the Common Era, and continued to be developed through the times of the Han Dynasty, in the milieu of Han poetry, when the work entitled Chuci was published in what is basically its modern form. Although many of the poets of the early tradition are anonymous, another important name linked with this tradition is Song Yu, who, like Qu Yuan, was a native of Chu, traditionally thought to have been wrongfully and mistakenly dismissed from court despite possessing both great talents and loyalty. Han Dynasty Besides the Han Dynasty writers and editors, such as Wang Yi, who contributed to the Chuci, another important Han era poet in the Xiaoxiang tradition was Jia Yi, who was exiled by Han Wendi to Changsha. On his way into exile, and upon crossing the Xiang River, Jia Yi wrote a fu named \\"Lament for Qu Yuan\\". After 3 years in exile, at sunset, an owl flew into his room: the depressed Jia Yi considered this as an omen of his exile soon reaching its miserable end, but only by means of his impending death, as signaled by this avian harbinger of doom; and so, he wrote another and subsequently renowned fu, \\"The Owl\\". After making these contributions to the Xiaoxiang poetry tradition, Jia Yi nevertheless lived on to be subsequently recalled to court. Six Dynasties During the Six Dynasties period, Yu Xin contributed to the Six Dynasties poetry in the genre of the Xiaoxiang poetry. Born into the Liang nobility, upon the defeat of Liang he was kept in captivity in the state of Western Wei. His fu \\"Lament for the South\\" is known in this regard. Tang Dynasty Further development of the Xiaoxiang poetry genre continued on through the Tang Dynasty, including the interlude of Wu Zetian's \\"Zhou\\" dynasty, with authors such as Shen Quanqi, Zhang Yue, Li Bai, Du Fu, Han Yu, and Liu Zongyuan. Song Dynasty Su Shi, Huang Tingjian, and other poets of the Song Dynasty wrote poetry in the Xiaoxiang genre.

This was part of Francis Drake's Great Expedition and was his last engagement on the Spanish Main before Drake headed north for the Roanoke Colony. The expedition also forced the Spanish to abandon any settlements and forts in present-day South Carolina.  Background  A map of Drake's voyage to the Spanish Main War had already been unofficially declared by Philip II of Spain after the Treaty of Nonsuch in which Elizabeth I had offered her support to the rebellious Protestant Dutch rebels. The Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World colonies in a kind of preemptive strike. Sailing from Plymouth, England, in November 1585 he struck first at Santiago in the Cape Verde islands off the northwest coast of Africa, then across the Atlantic at the Spanish city of Santo Domingo which was captured and ransomed on 1 January 1586; following that he successfully attacked the important city of Cartagena on 19 February.Jacques p.877 Drake wanted to strike at another Spanish city on the Spanish Main before finally visiting and replenishing Sir Walter Raleigh's new colony of Roanoke Colony on the American east coast. After this he hoped to make the transatlantic crossing back to England. The fleet headed north, and in late April Drake put into the Spanish Cuban mainland where his men dug wells in search of fresh water and gathered supplies to help counter an outbreak of dysentery, then he moved on. The fleet traveled north within sight of land on the Florida peninsula sailing past its eastern coast. On 27 May 1586 as they approached further north a small fort was spotted on the shore, with a small inlet close by. This was the location of St Augustine, the most northerly town in Spain's New World Empire. Drake knew of the place and was also aware of the fact that the Spanish under Pedro Menéndez de Avilés had ordered all of the French Huguenot colonists that had tried to settle in the area executed. Drake decided on one final opportunity to raid and plunder, and a chance to avenge his fellow Protestants.  Capture  The English attacked and bombarded a small wooden fort in the sand dunes; the Spanish there fired only a few shots and fled. Drake sent a landing party to investigate, while Christopher Carleill, captain of the Tiger, and a few volunteers rowed a ship's boat into the inlet and saw no sign of any Spaniards. It sat on a strip of sand, separated from the mainland by a band of water, which entered into the inlet. A French Huguenot Nicholas Borgoignon, who had been taken prisoner by the Spanish six years before was found in a boat and agreed to guide the English to the Spanish settlement.Johnson p.10-15 Sir Francis Drake The Spanish governor of St. Augustine, Pedro Menéndez de Márquez (nephew of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés), was warned that Drake was off the coast, and he realized that with fewer than a hundred militiamen he could offer little in the way of resistance. The Spanish settlers withdrew inland and hoped to make surprise raids against the English gradually. Drake and his men occupied the area of the small fort but during the night Indians, native allies of the Spanish garrison, attacked. Drake and his men held their ground and within twenty minutes the Indians were repulsed with some loss. The following day, Drake, Carleill, and around two hundred men advanced up the inlet in pinnaces and small boats, and they soon came upon the Spanish log stockade fort of San Juan. After a few shots by the Spanish, the English landed and took the fort with only a few losses. They found it deserted, as the Spanish had fled, but discovered an intact gun platform with fourteen bronze artillery pieces. They also found a chest containing the garrison's pay, about 2,000 gold ducats, which was inadvertently left behind in the retreat. Drake, knowing the Spanish had fled, began to plunder what he could; he took the guns, and burned the fort to the ground.Rowland p.45 Soon the English came upon the main settlement of St. Augustine itself, this time they found it deserted. The Spanish, however, were just outside the town when Drake's men arrived, and they opened up a skirmishing fire. Anthony Powell, one of Carleill's officers, was killed in the opening shots as he tried to assault the outskirts. Carleill's men then charged all the way to the outskirts of the town into the scrub, forcing the Spanish to retreat, and leaving Drake in control of the settlement. The English garrisoned the town overnight and the following day razed the whole of St. Augustine to the ground. All buildings were torched, crops were destroyed, and anything of value was either taken or destroyed. The fort of San Juan was burnt and all the artillery pieces were carried away by the English among other booty. Aftermath A 1584 map of the Roanoke colony Once the English had gone Menéndez and the rest of the Spanish settlers returned to find a smoldering ruins and very little left of their settlement. He soon begged for help from the viceroy of Cuba and the settlement took a while to build itself back up. The destroyed fort San Juan was replaced with another wooden fort. A masonry fortress to defend the presidio was not built until construction of the Castillo de San Marcos began in 1672. Roanoke Drake's fleet sailed from St. Augustine on 29 May, heading northwards up the coast, looking for signs of Raleigh's settlement. They cruised into what is now Charleston Harbor but found it deserted, then continued up the coast until they saw smoke. A boat was sent to investigate, and its crew finally made contact with the English settlers, who were encamped on Roanoke Island. Drake had no supplies but offered to take any of the settlers back to England; he sailed into Portsmouth on July 22. Drake was greeted as a national hero upon his arrival in England; by that time news of his daring raids on the Spanish Main had reached most of Europe. His direct assault on the Spanish Empire was disastrous for the prestige of Spain and threatened the continued flow of New World riches, in the form of silver and gold, into its national treasury. The Spaniards, who called Drake El Draque, regarded him as a monstrous pirate. Drake's strike at the heart of the Spanish colonial empire embarrassed the Spanish king, Philip II, and hardened his resolve to invade and conquer England.Konstam p.76-77  Consequences  The consequences of Drake's raid were significant to the Spanish. Rumors soon began to spread that the English had a settlement further north and were using the place as a base for piracy. This was confirmed by news from released Spanish prisoners that Drake had wanted to replenish the colony of Roanoke. Although the Spanish knew of Roanoke they could not find the English colony despite a number of military expeditions sent out. Menéndez came the closest reaching 37 degrees latitude but failed to find anything. Fearing another raid, and with the Spanish settlements on the American West coast being overstretched, undermanned, and underarmed; a crisis followed. Menéndez even conferred with the Council of the Indies in Seville (who received confirmation of St. Augustine's destruction by July) and Philip II, that all concentration should be in one place and that being at St. Augustine. Mendendez despite objections got his way and as a result Parris Island and Santa Elena were abandoned. This marked the end of the permanent Spanish presence in what today is South Carolina.  Legacy  In the present day the events of Sir Francis Drake's Raid are recreated in June at St. Augustine. So far there have been 27 re enactments and all are held in the old part of town.Drakes Raid The re-enactment features an encampment, drills, weapon demonstrations, and more.Drakes Raid Re-Enactment  See also  * Siege of St. Augustine (1702) * Siege of St. Augustine (1740)  References  ;Bibliography  * ;External links * Drake's Raid, A Detailed History Category:Military campaigns involving England Category:Military expeditions Category:Battles in Florida Category:Conflicts in 1586 St. Augustine (1586) Category:Spanish Florida Category:History of the Royal Navy Category:16th-century military history of the Kingdom of England Category:1580s in North America ","title":"Raid on St. Augustine"},{"id":"39025097","text":"Phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase (, PHOSPHO1, 3X11A) is an enzyme highly expressed in mineralizing cells with systematic name phosphoethanolamine phosphohydrolase.

The siege lasted from 14 October 1813 to 3 January 1814 during the Adriatic campaign of the Napoleonic Wars when the French surrendered. The engagement was fought in the Adriatic Sea for possession of the important fortress of Cattaro. Background As part of Venetian Albania, Cattaro had belonged to the Republic of Venice from 1420 to 1797, when it passed to the Habsburg Monarchy with the Treaty of Campo Formio. In 1805, it was assigned to the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy by the Treaty of Pressburg, but occupied by Russian troops under Dmitry Senyavin until they left after the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807. Three years later it was incorporated into the French Empire's Illyrian Provinces. Austria declared war on France in August 1813 and by the Autumn the Royal Navy enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea. Working in conjunction with the Austrian armies now invading the Illyrian Provinces and Northern Italy, Rear Admiral Thomas Fremantle's ships were able to rapidly transport British and Austrian troops from one point to another, forcing the surrender of the strategic ports, Zara for example had been liberated in December.James, Vol. 6, p. 257 Meanwhile, Royal Naval Captain William Hoste with his ship HMS Bacchante (38 guns) and a brig- sloop HMS Saracen (18 guns), under Captain John Harper had been given orders for the swift expulsion of the French in the region.Bjelovucic pg 143-44 They took part in an attack that seized the islands of Hvar and Brač and moved along the coast. Cattaro was next on the target for the British; a body of Montenegrin troops under Petar I Petrović-Njegoš a popular spiritual and military leader of the Montenegrin Orthodox ChurchViala de Somijer, Istorijski i politički put u Crnu Goru, II, Pariz, 1820, str. 15 from the Petrović dynasty had surrounded the place. Saracen arrived first just outside Cattaro Bay but it was impossible to sail direct to the main fortress so Harper called on the local inhabitants to tow her along the rocky shore for 3 miles. Hoste in Bacchante arrived soon after with three Sicilian gunboats carrying fifty soldiers and assumed command. The British and Sicilians forced the passage between Herceg Novi and Fort Rosa and secured an anchorage some three miles inside the outer bay. Blockade and Siege On the evening of the 14th Harper left with two gunboats, the launch and barge of Bacchante and the boats of Saracen entered the inner bay where he was fired on from the Island of St George. Afterwards heading four miles towards Cattaro he found four gunboats in a state of revolt and took possession of them. He then landed at various places where the local inhabitants were arming themselves against the French and collected volunteer crews for his new captures. The Northern walls of the Cattaro fortress At Perast Hoste found that the locals had taken possession of a French fort with 3 guns which they placed at his disposal, hoisting the English and Austrian colours. At 6am he used these guns, those of his gunboats and the newly acquired gunboats to bombard the island of St. George. Then within fifteen minutes the Royal marines and the Sicilians under Captain Harper in several smaller craft attacked a French gunboat force off the island seizing all four. The following day the boats of the squadron attacked the island itself and captured it, stationing a garrison to blockade Cattaro.James, Vol 6, p. 181 The prize gunboats each had a long 24-pounder in the bow and two of them each carried a 12-pounder carronade. Captain William Hoste who famously ordered guns to be hauled up the mountain to besiege Cattaro By now only the main fortress of Cattaro was left and Hoste, Harper and his assortment of allies – British, Croats, Montenegrins and Sicilians – surrounded the area. With the help of Montenegrins and the pro-Austrian natives of the liberated shores of the Bay of Kotor, Hoste found himself in an unpleasant position between the Montenegrins and their support on the one hand, and on the other the pro-Austrian population who were unwilling to submit themselves to Montenegrin domination. Hoste made sure to remain neutral as his main objective was the defeat of the French in the region. However, he knew that politics would eventually play a role if and when the area was under allied control and therefore also had to try to satisfy the British commissioner in the region Lord Aberdeen by ensuring that the Austrians were the ones to end up with the spoils. Hoste meanwhile had been ordered to attack elsewhere leaving Harper with the Saracen in charge. Hoste in the next month helped to take Split with troops of the 35th Foot and for the next month a close blockade was made on Cattaro with the hope of the arrival of Austrian troops. Bad weather had not helped the situation and after capturing Cavtat further north Hoste soon returned to the bay but found no Austrian troops. By early December the local French commander, General Gauthier, had retired to Fort St. John with 600 men. This fort lay on the side of the hill protecting the Western side of the fortified town of Cattaro. Hoste and Harper both agreed that use would be made of the local armed populace for the final stages of the siege. Preparations were made to place batteries all around Cattaro including the use of the top of the hill of St John as a primary position, right above the fortress itself. Hoste and Harper led their men in the difficult task of scattering batteries down the forbidding slopes of the Cattaro hills using block and tackle. In an \\"unmilitary manner\\" after 3 weeks of great exertion by Bacchante and Saracens seamen in continuous rain an 18-pounder was hoisted to the summit on 23 December, a height of nearly 3,000 feet.: \\"in what was denounced as a 'very unmilitary manner,' established a battery of heavy guns and mortars on the top of a rugged hill which dominated the enemy's position.\\" Meanwhile, Bacchante and the rest of her crew mounted further pieces of ordnance; two batteries of 18 and 32-pounders were added. Hoste, despite being ill, personally helped the men get the equipment up the slopes of the mountain but further North and South respectively of the fort and the main battery on the slope. On Christmas Day, with all guns in position and with the return of good weather, Hoste ordered the commencement of the bombardment. Fire was opened up from four different points, with the 18-pounder above the St John fortress being particularly effective. Saracen and Bacchante stayed out of range of the fort's guns until the bombardment started but then opened up with all they had. Hoste on the 2nd ordered Harper to lead a surprise night time assault. This was not necessary, however, as on 3 January 1814, when Harper was about to lead an assault, Gauthier offered to surrender. After ten days of shelling and no hope of relief the French surrendered to Hoste under honourable conditions and the British and Montenegrins took control of the fort and the town. After a ten-day siege, the French garrison had no alternative and surrendered on 5 January 1814.\\"Nafziger, Gioannini\\" pg. 148-9 Medal commemorating HMS Bacchante's bombardment of Cattaro 1814 Aftermath The loss on the British, amounting to only one seaman killed, and Lieutenant of marines slightly wounded. In the course of the twenty-day siege, Hoste had counted on the support of Austrian infantry which failed to show up. Hoste signed the articles of capitulation and the remaining French and Italian troops marched out in surrender, after which British troops marched in along with the Montenegrins. Hoste gave the town to the Montenegrin commission under Peter which aggravated Lord Aberdeen but Hoste argued that he had no choice in the matter. Hoste with Bacchante and Saracen after a short rest and recuperation left Cattaro to sail to the fortress of Ragusa where they laid siege to the place in a very similar manner to Cattaro and on the 28th it surrendered. By the end of March all of the towns and cities had surrendered to the British or the allied rebels that had risen in revolt, leaving the Adriatic in complete allied control with the exception of Corfu. Cattaro was restored to the Austrian Empire by the Congress of Vienna.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den österreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 See also * Fortifications of Kotor * Siege of Ragusa References ;Citations ;Bibliography   ;External links * James, William.

It existed under several variations of the 223 Brigade title, and was eventually converted into an airborne formation. First World War On the outbreak of World War I the Territorial Force (TF) immediately mobilised for home defence, but shortly afterwards (31 August 1914), its units were authorised to raise 2nd line battalions formed from those men who had not volunteered for, or were not fit for, overseas service, together with new volunteers, while the 1st Line went overseas to supplement the Regulars.Becke, p. 6. Early in 1915 the 2nd Line TF battalions were raised to full strength to form new divisions, and began to form Reserve (3rd Line) units to supply drafts.Becke, pp. 6, 65. The remaining Home Service men were separated out in May 1915 to form brigades of Coast Defence Battalions (termed Provisional Battalions from June 1915). 3rd Provisional Brigade 3rd Provisional Brigade was formed mainly from details of regiments from Eastern England, with the following composition:3rd Provisional Brigade War Diary, The National Archives, Kew file WO 95/5458. * 3rd Provisional Yeomanry Squadron (from the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry and the Lovat Scouts) * 3rd Provisional Cyclist Company * 3rd Provisional Battery and Ammunition Column Royal Field Artillery * 43rd Provisional Battalion (from the King's Regiment (Liverpool))King's Liverpool at Long, Long Trail * 62nd Provisional Battalion (from the 2/4th Bn Northamptonshire Regiment and the 2/1st Cambridgeshire Regiment)Northamptons 1914–1918, p. 341. * 64th Provisional Battalion * 66th Provisional Battalion (from the Essex Regiment)Burrows, p. 357. * 67th Provisional Battalion (from the Essex Regiment) * 3rd Provisional Brigade Train Army Service Corps * 3rd Provisional Field Ambulance Royal Army Medical Corps (from 2nd Welsh Field Ambulance) Under the command of Brigadier-General H.J. Archdale, the brigade was attached to the 69th (2nd East Anglian) Division in the area around Thetford, Newmarket and Bury St Edmunds under the control of First Army of Central Force (18 September – 16 October 1915).Becke, pp. 91–8. When the 3rd Provisional Brigade left the 69th Division, it also had the following units attached to it: * 117th Heavy Battery Royal Garrison Artillery * Half of 1/1st Devon Heavy Battery RGA * No 2 Armoured Train * 1/6th (Cyclist) Battalion Norfolk Regiment * 2/25th (Cyclist) Battalion London Regiment In March 1916 the Provisional Brigades were concentrated along the South and East Coast of England. 3rd Provisional Brigade came under the orders of Northern Army, with its battalions billeted across Norfolk as follows:Distribution of Northern and Southern Armies (Home Defence), The National Archives file WO 33/765. * Brigade Headquarters: Holt * 43rd Provisional Battalion Weybourne * 62nd Provisional Battalion Sheringham * 64th Provisional Battalion Salthouse * 66th Provisional Battalion Cley next the Sea * 67th Provisional Battalion Darsham * 2/1st Highland (Fifeshire) Heavy Battery, RGA, Sheringham – joined September 1916 from 64th (2nd Highland) DivisionBecke, pp. 58–9. 223rd Mixed Brigade The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The Provisional Brigades thus became anomalous, and at the end of 1916 their units became numbered battalions of their parent units. Part of their role was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. The 3rd Provisional Brigade became the 223rd Mixed Brigade in December 1916, with its units re-designated as follows:223 Bde at Warpath * 43rd Provisional Battalion became 25th Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) * 62nd Provisional Battalion became 9th Battalion, Northamptonshire RegimentNorthamptons at Long, Long Trail * 64th Provisional Battalion became 14th Battalion, Suffolk RegimentSuffolks at Long, Long Trail * 66th Provisional Battalion became 16th Battalion, Essex Regiment, and transferred to the 71st DivisionBecke, pp. 102–3.Essex at Long, Long Trail * 67th Provisional Battalion became 17th Battalion, Essex Regiment * 2/1st Highland (Fifeshire) Heavy Battery, RGA (unchanged) * 3rd Provisional Field Company became 642nd (London) Field Company Royal Engineers * 3rd Provisional Battery and Ammunition Column became 1205th (West Lancashire) Battery RFA * 3rd Provisional Brigade Train became 835th Company ASC * 3rd Provisional Field Ambulance became 331st Field Ambulance RAMC The brigade was attached to the 64th (2nd Highland) Division. In May 1918 each of the Mixed Brigades was called upon to provide a battalion (re-designated a Garrison Guard battalion) to reconstitute the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, which had been virtually destroyed during the German Spring Offensive. The 223rd Mixed Brigade supplied 25th King's (Liverpool Regiment) to the 176th (2/1st Staffordshire) Brigade and immediately raised a new 27th (Home Service) Battalion, King's to take over its coast defence duties.Becke, pp. 20–21.King's Liverpool at Warpath The brigade remained with this composition until the end of the war, after which it was demobilised. Second World War In World War II the brigade number was reactivated for the 223rd Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), formed for service in the United Kingdom in Eastern Command. The brigade was attached to the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division (31 October 1940 – 26 February 1941) and then the Essex County Division (26 February – 22 July 1941) before coming under the command of XI Corps. While in this formation it was re-designated as the 223rd Independent Infantry Brigade.Joslen, p. 386.

Ali Akbar Bahman was during the rule of the Qajar dynasty as well as at the time of Reza Shah Pahlavi ambassador and minister.Baqer 'Aqeli: \\"Ali Akbar Bahman\\", in: Sharh-e hal-e rejal, Vol. I, pp. 325-26, Tehran 2001.

Ali Akbar Bahman as ambassador in Cairo receiving Mohammad Reza Pahlavi the crown prince of Iran and Princess Fowzieh bint Fouad of Egypt, March 1939. Ali Akbar Bahman at the Cairo Conference, 1943.  Family Background  Ali Akbar Bahman was a member of the famous Bahmani-Qajar family. He was born in Tehran as Mirza Ali Akbar Khan in 1883, and died there in 1967. He descended from the family of Prince Bahman Mirza Qajar, son of Abbas Mirza, Iran's hero in two rounds of Perso-Russian wars of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828. Bahman Mirza (1810-1884), was governor-general of Azerbaijan, and prince-regent for his ill brother Mohammad Shah and the infant crown prince Nasir al-Din. After Bahman Mirza fell out of favour at court he went into exile to the Russian Caucasus. His eldest son Prince Anoushiravan Mirza (1833-1899) returned to Iran, and had a daughter called Princess Malekeh Afagh Khanom (1863 - 26 October 1917), Ali Akbar Bahman's mother. His father was Mirza Hossein Behnam from an aristocratic family from Tabriz, which served the royal house since the days of Fath Ali Shah. Because of his father's early death in 1897 his mother married secondly Amanollah Khan entitled Zia' os- Soltan (lit. \\"Splendour of the Sovereign\\") from the Donboli family, her maternal cousin, who was a big landowner at Tabriz, and notable at court. His stepfather, a politician in the Iranian constitutional movement, encouraged young Ali Akbar in his career and introduced him to several political figures of that time like Yahya Dowlatabadi.Ahmad Kasravi: Tarikh-e Mashruteh-ye Iran (History of the Constitutional Revolution in Iran), Vol 1, Tehran, 2537 imperial calendar, p. 661Soltan Ali Mirza Kadjar: \\"Mohammad Ali Shah: The Man and the King\\", in: Qajar Studies, Vol VII, 2007, pp. 177-195, p. 185. In 1931, when family names were mandated in Iran, Ali Akbar and his siblings Ali Asghar and Nosrat ol-Molouk Khanom named their family Bahman in honor of their grandfather Prince Bahman Mirza.Asadollah Behnam: Khandan-e Behnam, Tehran 1962, p. 4  Career  From noble birth with his mother a royal princess, the young Mirza Ali Akbar Khan had every chance to make a career at court. Thus, he was occupied in the administration service. His stepfather was a staunch opponent to absolutism and open to reforms, thus he supported the Constitutional Movement of 1906. His companion Yahya Dowlatabadi, a leading left-winged constitutional politician and reformist of the Iranian school system sent Mirza Ali Akbar Khan in 1907 to Russian Azerbaijan to teach at the Persian Sa'adat-School at Baku. There, a lot of Ali Akbar's relatives from his mother's family lived. After the Russian Revolution and World War I many Persians from the Caucasus tried to escape from the Red Army to Iran. With his family ties in Azerbaijan and Iran, Ali Akbar Bahman was able to help many of these refugees to cross the border. On 26 August 1919 Ali Akbar was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Persia to Bucharest, and then in 1921 he became ambassador to Belgium. 1934-1935 he was Iran's Imperial Ambassador in Afghanistan, and in 1935 arranged the \\"Atabay Arbitration\\" (territorial exchanges between both countries in the Sistan-Zabulistan region).Ali Akbar Khan Bahman In 1935 he also became Minister of Transport and with seven other members of the cabinet responsible for the 1935 commemoration stamp set.Bianca Devos/Christoph Werner: \\"Culture and Cultural Politics under Reza Shah\\", p. 165, New York 2014. Finally 1939-1943 he became ambassador in Egypt. There he arranged the marriage of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (in those days Crown Prince of Iran) with Princess Fawzia, daughter of King Fouad I and sister of King Farouk of Egypt on 16 March 1939 in the Abdeen Palace at Cairo.Mohammad Ali Bahmani-Ghajar: Nevesteh-e Bahman Mirza, p. 4, Tehran 2012.Gilbert Clayton: An Arabian Dictionary, p. 110, n. 12, Los Angeles 1969. Back in Iran from Egypt, where he also headed a gathering of Iranians at the embassy about Iranian Settlement in Egypt and participated in the Cairo Conference 1943, Ali Akbar Bahman became sometimes Minister for Trade 1944-1946. He bought the splendid Gowharshad residence in Tehran and a huge garden area of Bagh-e Mostowfi, in the city's cosy north at the slopes of Alburz Mountains. Ali Akbar Bahman died in 1967 and was buried next to his mother's mausoleum in the Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine, Tehran. Ali Akbar Bahman married Zoleykha Khanom Gadjieva and issued one daughter, Mehr-e Jahan (Mehri) Khanom Bahman.

He was from Authie, and died at Amiens. Up to eleven works are sometimes attributed to him, but only five are certain. From at least 1223 Simon served as a canon, and in 1228 as dean of the chapter, at Amiens Cathedral. He worked as a lawyer for the Abbey of Saint Vaast in a lawsuit against lay assessors (1222–26) and a case involving the chapter of Arras Cathedral (1232).

The latter two were judged by the trouvère Adam de Givenchi. Both Gilles and Adam appear in the same documents relating to Amiens and Saint Vaast. Although music survives for six other pieces of Simon's, it is irregular, difficult to interpret in terms of modes, lacking in mensural notation and being open to different interpretations of its intervals.

Its performance was not markedly better than that of the much heavier Nieuport-Delage NiD 62 then going into production, so only two were flown. Design and development The Nieuport NiD 48 was designed for a French 1926 light fighter competition. Unlike many Nieuport designs of the period it was not a sesquiplane but a monoplane, its wing mounted like those of the sesquiplanes over the fuselage in parasol wing configuration. It looked much like a NiD 42 with its ancillary wing removed but had smaller dimensions and only was half the loaded weight. It had a straight-edged, constant chord wing with blunt tips, full span ailerons with a slightly curved trailing edges and a small cutout over the cockpit for better pilot visibility. As on the NiD 42, the wing was braced with Y-form struts from the undercarriage axle support structure, assisted by a cabane of two transverse inverted Vs from the fuselage in front of the cockpit. Both NiD 48s built used Hispano-Suiza upright V-12 water-cooled engines, with a 12Jb in the first prototype and a 12Hb in the second, the NiD 48bis. Behind the engine the fuselage had a circular cross-section, with the single-seat open cockpit under the wing trailing edge, tapering to the tail. The cantilever tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage height and was elliptical in plan with unbalanced elevators. The fin was almost triangular but carried a round edged rudder, also unbalanced, which ended above the fuselage. The NiD 48 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, the mainwheels on a faired axle supported by a pair of rearward leaning V-struts which also carried rectangular radiators for engine cooling. There was a tail skid. The first airframe was completed in October 1926 and used for static load testing. The first to fly began its official tests in May 1927, with the NiD 48bis following that September. Although lighter than the similarly powered NiD 62, in trials conducted in March 1928 the NiD 48bis bettered it significantly only in rate of climb. but since the NiD 62 was already in production it was decided not to proceed with the NiD 48. Operational history NiD 481 photo from L'Aerophile Salon 1932 In July 1929 one of the prototypes went to Etampes as a trainer.

He also recorded as a solo artist for Sun Records and worked as a session musician. Life and career Hill was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi. His parents, Henry and Ollie Mae Hill, ran cafes in Clarksdale as well as a juke joint north of Lyon which featured Delta blues musicians such as Sonny Boy Williamson and Robert Nighthawk. Hill learned to play the saxophone by getting Houston Stackhouse to strum the chords on his guitar then finding the corresponding notes on his saxophone. Hill joined Ike Turner's band in the late 1940s, first the Tophatters big band and then the smaller Kings of Rhythm. He was Turner's regular tenor saxophone player at the band's first recording sessions at Sam Phillips' Memphis Recording Service in March 1951, which produced the R&B; classic \\"Rocket 88.\\" The record was credited to Kings of Rhythm saxophonist and vocalist Jackie Brenston. The record features a solo by 17-year-old Hill, after Brenston's cry of \\"blow your horn, Raymond, blow!.\\" The single reached number-one on the Billboard R&B; chart, and has often been called \\"the first rock and roll record.\\"Biography by Shaun Mather, Black Cat Rockabilly. Retrieved April 5, 2013 Hill left Turner's band soon after the record was released. Turner stated Hill's mother wanted him to be the bandleader and they started to quarrel. Hill continued to play on some of Turner's records. He also worked as a session musician at Sun Records and other local labels, backing Howlin' Wolf and Little Junior Parker among others. Hill plays tenor sax on Parker's \\"Mystery Train,\\" and he is the lead performer on the instrumental \\"Ooh Poo Pah Doo (Part II)\\" by Jessie Hill. \\"Spread your fingers, Raymond!,\\" shouts Jessie Hill who was no relation. In October 1952, Hill recorded a session at Sun Studio with his own band Raymond Hill and his Jump For Joy, including Turner's former guitarist Willie Kizart. Sam Phillps offered the tapes to Chess Records and they were rejected. It was in the midst of Phillips falling out with the Chess brothers. The recordings were later released on the compilation albums Sun: The Roots Of Rock: Volume 3: Delta Rhythm Kings in 1976, Sun: The Roots Of Rock: Volume 11: Memphis Blues Sounds released in 1977, and Sun Records: The Blues Years 1950-1956 in 1984. Hill's band enjoyed some success back in Clarksdale and he held a disc jockey position at WROX to promote his band. The local Clarksdale Press Register newspaper reported that Hill was chief of the hepcats. Hill also recorded with Turner's band, featuring Turner on guitar and Billy \\"The Kid\\" Emerson on piano, releasing the single \\"The Snuggle\\"/\\"Bourbon Street Jump\\" under his own name on Sun in 1954, both sides being instrumentals. Between 1952 and 1955, Hill played on records with Clayton Love (Aladdin,'52), Little Junior Parker (Modern,'52/Sun,'53), Billy \\"The Kid\\" Emerson (Sun,'54), and Jesse Knight (Checker,'54). While in Chicago, he also accompanied Dennis \\"Long Man\\" Binder (United,'55) before rejoining Turner's Kings of Rhythm. In 1955, Hill returned to working in Turner's band on a full-time basis and moved to East St. Louis where Turner had relocated. The Kings of Rhythm played all around the Greater St. Louis area and became a popular nightclub attraction. In 1957, Hill began a relationship with the band's new vocalist, 17-year-old Ann Bullock, then known as Little Ann and later as Tina Turner. Together they had a child, Raymond Craig (August 20, 1958 – July 3, 2018), who was later adopted by Ike Turner and renamed Craig Raymond Turner. Before the birth of his son, Hill broke his ankle during a wrestling match with vocalist Carlson Oliver and left the band, returning to Clarksdale. Hill toured with Albert King in the 1960s. In 1979, he recorded an EP (\\"Going Down\\" / \\"Cotton Fields - Boss Man\\") with his wife Lillie Hill which was released in 1980 for the newly founded High Water Recording Company, then he left the music business.

Eagly (born December 25, 1938) is a professor of psychology and of management and organizations at Northwestern University (Evanston, Illinois). She currently holds the James Padilla Chair for Arts and Sciences and a Faculty Fellowship for the Institute of Policy Research at Northwestern University. Her primary research contributions have been in the area of social psychology, as well as personality psychology and Industrial Organizational Psychology. Background Eagly was born on December 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, to Harold and Josara Eagly. She completed her undergraduate degree at Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts) in Social Relations in 1960. She received her M.A. in psychology and her Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan). She also holds two honorary doctorates: from the University of Bern (Bern, Switzerland) and from Erasmus University (Rotterdam, Netherlands). Eagly has held teaching positions at several universities including Michigan State University, University of Massachusetts, and Purdue University, as well as visiting positions at University of Illinois, Harvard University, University of Tübingen, University of Amsterdam, and University of Southern California. She has written or contributed to 7 books and over 100 journal articles. Research Eagly has worked on various topics in psychology including prejudice, sex differences, leadership styles, attitudes, and feminism. She discusses not only gender differences and stereotypes but also the underlying idea of prejudice, which can apply to not only gender but also other disadvantaged groups. Eagly uses much of her research to show that discrimination happens when the individual steps outside of the given stereotype ascribed to their group. This is a basis for much of her research on gender discrimination and stereotypes. One of her most important contributions to the field of psychology is her theory on role congruity, the belief that prejudice arises when one social groups' stereotype mismatches their valued success in other social roles. That is, society views one social groups role to be exclusive to that group in particular, and that venturing outside this could not be a successful endeavor, thus creating prejudicial attitudes. Eagly explores this idea in her research to show that the attributes ascribed to the group are not necessarily negative, but just different from that which is assumed of the group. This theory has been most noteworthy in her research regarding sex differences and leadership among women in the workplace and in the home. Much of her research focuses on feminist ideas and upward mobility in both the workforce and in traditional gender roles for women. Her contributions in these areas of psychology have illuminated issues concerning gender stereotypes in modern American society. Madeline Heilman and Eagly research what they call a \\"lack of fit\\" in workplace employment, which is based on the same idea as the role incongruity. This idea emphasizes how there is the assumption that the stereotypical attributes of the group are not ideal or fit for the task or job position in question. Eagly has contributed several notable studies to the body of research on sex differences. For example, her work in the area of mate- preferences showed that men and women who held more traditional gender ideologies preferred more gender stereotypical qualities in a partner. Women with more traditional attitudes looked for older mates while more traditional men sought younger mates compared to males and females who reported less traditional gender ideologies. In an additional study, Eagly found that participant's mate-preferences could be shifted by asking them to see themselves in different marital roles. When instructed to envision oneself in the provider role, participants placed a greater emphasis on a mate's homemaker skills and the preferred age for the mate decreased. She also found, however, that changing one's expected marital role could not completely eliminate gender differences in preference for earning potential; women consistently looked for a greater earning potential in a mate compared to men. Other research that Eagly participated in looks at women who were highly educated and their anticipated marital roles. This study shows that these women anticipated inequality in areas such as employment hours, salary, housework and childcare in comparison to the amount of work that they expected their husbands to do. Further research in this study also shows that women who anticipated greater employment opportunity showed a general decrease in gender role assumptions, but also felt that they felt their relationships with their family and emotional well-being would be affected adversely. Eagly developed the social role theory which attributes current sex differences to the labor division between men and women. This theory emphasizes the social component of sex differences. It operates around the idea of correspondence inference, which is the tendency to ascribe a person's behavior to her or his disposition or personality and to underestimate the extent to which situational factors elicited the behavior. Eagly suggests that men and women were constrained to certain roles in the work force and then assumed to embody the psychological characteristics of those roles without exception.

Francis is an Native American educator, environmental activist, and community planner for the Passamaquoddy people. She resides in Perry, Maine within the Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation (Sipayik). Francis writes and speaks frequently about environmental issues and tribal politics in newspapers, at conferences and on websites. As part of the non-profit N'tutlankeyutmonen N'kihtaqmikon, Francis has advocated for the environmental preservation of Pleasant Point-Passamaquoddy ancestral territory. Because Passamaquoddy ancestral homeland is now divided by the Canada–United States border along the St. Croix River, Francis has been involved with legal proceedings concerning both countries' governments, including litigation between the Bureau of Indian Affairs, members of the Passamaquoddy-Pleasant Point (Sipayik) Reservation, and Liquefied Natural Gas company Quoddy Bay LNG. Quoddy Bay LNG and N'tutlankeyutmonen N'kihtaqmikon In June 2005, Oklahoma Company Quoddy Bay LNG L.L.C. received ground lease approval to be used for the construction of a liquefied natural gas processing and transfer terminal. This lease was acquired through land use approval by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, despite prior legal agreements explicitly granting internal control to the Passamaquoddy tribes, per the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980. The terminal was to be built on Passamaquoddy tribal land held in trust between the BIA and the Passamaquoddy. Though initial approval was facilitated by the BIA, a final vote by tribal members was necessary to approve the lease. Five months later, Francis' advocacy group Ntulankeyutmonen Nkitahkomikon (NN) entered legal proceedings with Quoddy Bay LNG, citing that despite tribal voting, the lease agreement was improperly approved between the BIA and the Passamaquoddy based on previous land rights. NN has continued to make the claim that Pleasant Point Reservation and surrounding Passamaquoddy territory be used to generate an environmentally sound economy. Following three years of legal debate between NN and Quoddy Bay LNG, the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismissed Quoddy Bay's application for the LNG terminal after the company failed to provide sufficient environmental research. FERC's October 2008 decision to dismiss the application without prejudice granted the potential for Quoddy Bay LNG to resubmit materials for FERC approval at a later date, thus delaying the project independently from tribal intervention. Because the issue of Passamaquoddy tribal land ownership remained outstanding, legal proceedings continued. The Maine Federal District Court established after lengthy legal proceedings that the Quoddy Bay case undergo administrative appeal through the Interior Board of Indian Appeals. With proper jurisdiction, IBIA judge Deborah G. Luther ruled the original lease agreement invalid, recognizing that the BIA had violated its own rules against lease of tribal land. On June 9, 2009, the Passamaquoddy tribal council voted unanimously to end its lease with Quoddy Bay LNG. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission notes that Quoddy Bay LNG has not refiled for environmental approval, thus ending any iteration of the project.

He and Robert Symon, an industrialist from Boston, purchased 1.3 million acres of land between Monterrey and Saltillo, which constituted the only workable railway route between Monterrey and the interior of Mexico. After the Mexican National Construction Company chose to plot the Mexican National Railroad across this land, Symon sold his stake for $60,000 to a group of British investors incorporated as the San Marcos and Pinos company, while Cloete - who gained an additional advantage from land ownership, since the railway would access several mines he owned - retained his stake, eventually becoming a director of the new company. On 18 July 1902 he married Violet Kate Henley, the daughter of Joseph Arthur Henley; they maintained a residence in Hare Park outside London. Cloete is also noted for his belief in the legend of the Lost Nigger Gold Mine; he offered Lock Campbell, a Texan man, expenses of $10,000 if he would undertake an expedition to find it.

He was an organizer of the civil rights student group Students for Integration, a CORE Soul Force Member, a Freedom Rider, and one of the Americus Four who faced a death penalty for helping citizens legally vote.  Early life and education  Zev Aelony was born on February 21, 1938 in Palo Alto, California to Janet and David Aelony. His father, David Aelony, emigrated from Odessa in the Soviet Union to the United States in 1925, eventually earning his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry at Stanford University, in 1938. His roommate at a Kibbutz was a Moslem Arab. From that time, he championed equality for all ethnic groups in the state of Israel. Aelony grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He studied Russian and played football at University High School, from which he graduated in 1956. Aelony attended the University of Chicago for two years and then lived at the Kibbutz Shoval in Israel for a year. Upon his return to the United States, Aelony spent the summer of 1959 at Koinonia, a Christian community in southwest Georgia. He continued his education at the University of Minnesota, where he graduated in 1961 with a major in political theory and a minor in anthropology. He met his wife, Karen Olson, at the university. They were married for 43 years, until Aelony's death in 2009. They had four sons together: Bjorn, Ephraim, Phil, and Jared.  Career  To support his family, Aelony and his wife owned a small business selling security products for commercial buildings. As a matter of principle, they did not sell any equipment designed to injure people, such as guns or knives. Aelony became an advocate for civil rights and social justice beginning in his teen years. From his earliest years he was an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi and non-violent resistance to injustice. At the University of Minnesota, he helped found Students for Integration, a group dedicated to gaining housing and employment for black and minority students. Aelony was arrested several times for testing the ban on segregated interstate travel in the Deep South as a Freedom Rider. He was famously arrested and served time on death row in Americus, Georgia, for attempting to register black voters. Aelony has been described as a soft- spoken and peaceful man who practiced nonviolence and continued to fight for justice throughout his lifetime.  Influences   Religion  The Aelony family was Jewish, which contributed to Zev Aelony's belief in peace and nonviolence. He lived at the Kibbutz Shoval in Israel from 1958 to 1959. While there, he read an editorial about the communal Christian settlement Koinonia in Georgia which was founded by Clarence Jordan in 1942. At the time, Koinonia Farm gained notoriety as a target of racial bigotry, and was even bombed. Aelony spent the summer of 1959 in Koinonia working with and learning about the people there, who impressed him. In addition to his native English language, he spoke Hebrew, German, and Russian. His German skills were put to the test in 1963 when the European press descended on the CORE workers, many of whom did not speak English. His explanation to the press in German of what they were trying to accomplish was published widely in Europe and contributed to the pressure on Washington to uphold the Supreme Court ruling against discrimination in public transportation in interstate commerce.  Family  Aelony's father, David, was an immigrant and was involved in the opposition to the rise of Nazism in Germany, where he had relatives. David Aelony spoke fluently in English, German, Hebrew, Yiddish, and French, and also knew parts of other Slavic and Germanic languages as well as Spanish and Italian. David Aelony began welcoming refugees into his home when he met them on the streets. One of the turning points in Zev Aelony's life occurred around the age of 18, when his family was invited to a Minneapolis picnic because of his father's work with the refugees. Jewish refugees from Europe and Japanese-Americans who had been in the detention camps out west attended the picnic. Zev Aelony was shocked to meet kids who came out of concentration camps in the United States, a place where he believed things like that did not occur.  Experiences  Aelony was not completely naïve about segregation and first became involved in civil rights campaigns in high school. During this time in the mid-1950s, he participated in the distribution of NAACP postcards bearing the slogan \\"Completely Free by ’63,\\" though to him this goal seemed too distant. The hatred Aelony witnessed towards the Koinonia community for practicing racial equality drove him towards participation in the Civil Rights Movement. In September 1959, he attended a ten-day CORE training seminar in Miami, Florida. The seminar focused on nonviolence training and was attended by many people involved in the Freedom Rides, including Patricia Stephens Due and her sister Priscilla Stevens. The seminar was held at the Sir John Motel, one of the few places in Miami that allowed blacks and whites to stay together. The nonviolence training consisted of techniques in organizing and training, and also emphasized the need to understand the people who were against integration. Aelony came to believe that it was important to understand why people do things rather than just dividing them into categories of good and bad.  Civil rights work   Students for Integration (SFI)  Aelony worked with a group of students to help find housing for Persian students. This population had difficulty securing housing because it was rumored that they rubbed their skin with olive oil, which ruined the bedding. If the minority students were told an apartment complex was full, white students would go ask for a room there to test the fairness of the renters. The students would then talk to the renters, who were often embarrassed and would agree to rent to the minority students.  Freedom Rider  Meanwhile, the sit-in movement, which encouraged local student activism, began to spread throughout the nation, and Students for Integration organized support at the university. In the summer of 1961, there was a call for more Freedom Riders to help demonstrate the rights of all Americans to equal accommodation on public transportation as the law required. Zev Aelony and five others, including Claire O’Conner, Gene Uphoff, Dave Martin, Marv Davidoff, and Bob Baum, set off on a bus journey with New Orleans as the final destination. The first part of the ride was uneventful, and the group did not experience any violence. They stopped in Nashville to stay at the Freedom House with Diane Nash and Rodney Powell, and they joined in a picket of a grocery store there. The Freedom Riders continued on their journey and were arrested when they arrived in Jackson, Mississippi. Police Chief Captain Ray met them inside the door of the black waiting room, and they were taken to the Jackson City Jail. After a couple of nights they were transferred to the Hines County Jail, and when that facility filled up they were moved to Mississippi's notorious Parchman Farm. While there, Aelony participated in a hunger strike with several others, and he was isolated for a period of time for writing \\"you’ll reap what you sow\\" on the back wall with a spoon. In retrospect, the federal government seemed slow to respond to the request from civil rights workers to enforce the interstate commerce clause decision by the supreme court, both for political reasons, for caution, and until international pressures arose to demonstrate US commitment to democracy, freedom of travel, and equality under the law. Aelony's interview in May 1963 in German with a West German filmmaker played extensively on TV in Europe, contributing immediately to the political pressure from Europe.Stanton, Mary; Freedom Walk, p 121, University Press of Mississippi, 2003  CORE Soul Force  In the spring of 1963, Aelony became a part of the Journey of Reconciliation. The Journey of Reconciliation began when William Moore, a white Mississippian postman whose wife was black, set off on foot from Chattanooga, Tennessee to deliver a letter to Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett asking him to accept integration. When Moore was shot dead,Freedom Walk, Mary Stanton, 2003, University Press of Mississippi five members of CORE and five members of SNCC responded to his wife's request that the journey be carried on. The group, an equal mix of black and white males, was arrested for \\"walking into the state of Alabama in a manner designed to incite a breach of the peace\\".  Americus Four  In 1963, Aelony was asked to go back to Sumter County, Georgia, where Koinonia is located, to the town of Americus to assist with a voter registration drive there. Aelony worked with SNCC and the local Sumter County Movement to help blacks register to vote. He taught protest standards to picketers at a local restaurant, and he also showed the group's photographer how to take pictures that would be useful in court. He performed similar activities in Ocala, Florida. When Aelony took a sample picture, a deputy arrived and asked him to stop photographing. Aelony said \\"it's a free country\\", and was immediately arrested. He was taken to jail in Ocala. Officers told the inmates he was a Freedom Rider, and left him unattended in the jail \\"bullpen\\", where he was beaten unconscious and kicked until a woman visitor called attention to the abuse. Aelony was eventually released after the intervention of Minnesota's governor, who was attending the Governor's Conference in Miami, and he returned to Americus. The arrests in Americus continued to take place; hundreds of people who were a part of the voting rights drive were taken to a camp outside of town. Aelony attended the march as a non-participant observer and was arrested on a charge of insurrection against the state of Georgia. This charge carried the death penalty under Georgia's 1871 Anti-Treason Act. Three other CORE fieldworkers, Ralph Allen, Don Harris, and John Perdew, were arrested in Americus as well. With Aelony, this group became known as the Americus Four while they spent time on death row. Their arrest originally went unnoticed in the United States, but attracted attention in Europe and Africa. As public concern grew, awareness spread within the United States and eventually put pressure on the federal government to attend to the arrests in Georgia. The Americus Four were ultimately exonerated. Shortly afterward, he suffered a myocardial infarction and was hospitalized at Grady Hospital, by a local black physician who cared for the CORE workers. Thus, Aelony integrated the black ward at Grady Hospital. He was examined there by the famous academic cardiologist, Professor Willis Hurst, who felt his heart attack was related to his beating in Ocala, Florida. He was then advised to terminate his dangerous protest work in the deep South.  Later life and death  Aelony continued to be politically active in his hometown of Minneapolis throughout his life. He worked on the political campaign of Keith Ellison, a Muslim who ran for Congress on a peace platform. In 2006, Ellison became the first Muslim elected to Congress; he was also the first African-American from Minnesota to be elected to the House of Representatives. Aelony died of metastatic colon cancer on November 1, 2009 at his home. He was 71 years old.

She also wrote under the name \\"Aunt Polichna\\". \\"Timrava\\" was taken from the name of a popular small lake with a fountain, where she liked to sit while writing. Biography She was born into the family of Paul Slančík, a Lutheran pastor and one of the co- founders of Matica Slovenská. She had ten siblings of whom six survived to adulthood. At fifteen, she briefly attended a public boarding school at Banská Bystrica, otherwise her education took place entirely at home, where she lived until her father's death in 1909.Introduction to \\"That Alluring Land\\" by N. Rudinsky Although she made several attempts to leave, she had little success finding a job. For three months, she was a companion to a wealthy widow in Dolný Kubín, and later became the caretaker of collections at the Slovak National Museum in Martin, but this also lasted only for a short time. After her father's death, she moved in with her mother, near her twin brother Ábelová's rectory. While at Martin, she had made the acquaintance of Elena Maróthy-Šoltésová, a member of the Slovak women's movement, who encouraged her to be a writer. Royalties, however, were slim and she was forced to take a position as a kindergarten teacher; a post she held from 1919-1929, when she retired. Her small pension was not sufficient and the royalties from her writing didn't increase, so she moved to Lučenec in 1945, to live with relatives. In 1947, she was awarded the title of \\"National Artist\\". Writing Although she lived in relative seclusion for her entire life, she had meetings with many eminent Slovak cultural figures such as the poet Kolomon Banšell, Ema Goldpergerová (one of the co-founders of the Slovak National Museum) and Olga Petianová (Štefan Krčméry's mother). Her first works were issued in a handwritten journal called \\"Ratolest\\" (Sprig), produced together with her sister Irene. Satirical verses comprised most of her early works, but she eventually turned to novels and short stories, with an occasional play. Her writings describe people and their thoughts, as well as offering some critical commentary on political and ethnic issues. The stories usually take place in a village or small town in her native region, and many of them are based on her own experiences. Although love is often the principal motive in her stories, she never became sentimental, which was the tendency of most earlier Slovak prose.

In the month of her thirtieth birthday, Ender was appointed by then Governor Mark Wells White as the first judge of the then newly established 341st Judicial District, based in her native Laredo in Webb County in south Texas. Salinas served for twenty-nine years in the judicial position prior to her retirement, announced in 2011 and effective on December 31, 2012. She hence set a record of longevity among the four Webb County justices serving in recent decades on the state courts, Districts 49, 111, 341, and 406, numbered in order of creation by the Texas Legislature. Background Ender is the youngest of three children of Oscar David Salinas, Sr. (1924-1997), and the former Elma Lopez (1922-2016), a native of Hebbronville, Texas, who was employed for many years by the Webb County tax assessor's office. Judge Ender's two brothers are Oscar David Salinas, Jr., and Juan Alberto Salinas, Sr., and his wife, Janet. Ender graduated in 1970 from J. W. Nixon High School in Laredo. In 1974, she received her undergraduate degree in accounting and Spanish from the University of Texas at Austin. She obtained her law degree in 1978 from St. Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio.Valerie Godines Fitzgerald, \\"Historic Path: Judge Ender retires from post,\\" Laredo Morning Times, December 31, 2012, pp. 1, 14A Court service Ender said that when she was a young attorney appointed to the district court she had no idea then that she would be the first Hispanic woman in such a position in Texas history. \\"One thing about Mark White that some people may not remember is that he was very careful to appoint a percentage of individuals to commissions or to courts that reflected the population of Texas,\\" recalled Ender. Her judicial duties initially included juvenile law, the appeals of which go directly to the Texas Supreme Court. Since her tenure on the court began, she has observed an explosion in both juvenile and child-abuse cases in Webb County. She urged support in the 1990s for legislation sponsored by the late Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock, which called for reduced class sizes in public schools and testing for learning disabilities. Ender was among civic and political figures in Laredo who fought for the establishment of the four-year Texas A&M; International University, located off the interstate loop named for Bob Bullock. In 1984, Ender was elected to her first four-year term on the court. She was reelected without opposition in 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008. She served as the administrative judge for the Webb County district court judges. Ender did not seek an eighth term in the Democratic primary election held on May 29, 2012. Instead, another Hispanic woman, Beckie Palomo of Laredo, was tapped by voters for the 341st Judicial District. Palomo then faced no Republican opposition in the general election held on November 6, 2012 in the staunchly Democrat county. In 2011, Judge Ender forbade the family of murder defendant Joseph Allen Garcia from observing the jury selection process in the case. She cited the fire code and the lack of available space in the courtroom in making her determination. Garcia was tried and convicted in the 2003 drive-by killing in Laredo of Mario Alberto Gonzalez. Garcia, who maintains that he never committed the crime, was sixteen years old at the time of the arrest. He posted bond in the amount of $1.25 million and promptly fled to Mexico. Garcia was named to the U.S. Marshal's \\"15 Most Wanted List\\". The case was carried by John Walsh's television series, America's Most Wanted. After seven years, Garcia was re-arrested in 2010 and immediately extradited to the United States. Garcia ultimately received seventy years imprisonment, which he began serving in the state prison in Beeville. In 2013, after Ender had retired from the bench, the Texas Fourth Court of Appeals in San Antonio determined that she violated Garcia's rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution by barring his family from observing jury deliberations. The appeals court ordered a new trial at the district court level on grounds that Judge Ender failed to make proper accommodations for the Garcia family so they could observe the deliberations. Otherwise, the appeals court said that the trial had elements of a \\"private\\" event, rather than a fully public proceeding.Zach Brooke, \\"Conviction reversal: Judges find Garcia's Sixth Amendment rights violated\\", Laredo Morning Times, March 21, 2013, pp. 1, 16A Personal life Ender's husband, David Allen Ender (born 1952), is an area supervisor for a pipeline company.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on February 13, 2013. Plot In the opening scene, Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) and Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) play a game of racquetball. Stan explains that the game is about making your opponent move too fast in order to make a mistake. Stan is paged by Nina (Annet Mahendru) and meets up with her. She informs him about Rob (Chase Coleman), the agent who worked with Philip and Elizabeth (Keri Russell) in their kidnapping of Timoshev, and who was killed. The FBI send a picture of Rob to DMVs across the country and discover he has a wife and a newborn son living in Philadelphia. Philip and Elizabeth receive a hidden message in the classifieds section of a newspaper about Rob arranging a meet in Philadelphia. Philip suggests that Gregory Thomas (Derek Luke), a former black militant whom Elizabeth recruited, should go to the meet. Elizabeth meets Gregory in his apartment, where he makes a pass at her, but she rejects him, telling him that she is committed to Philip. Gregory agrees to go to the meet and confesses his love for Elizabeth. Gregory stations several of his men hiding in plain sight to watch over the meet. Gregory notices a woman with a baby sitting on a bench and sees that the FBI are tailing her. The woman is revealed to be Joyce Ramirez (Audrey Esparza), Rob's widow. Using his men to trip up the tailing FBI, Gregory gets Joyce away from their surveillance and brings her to a safe house, along with Philip and Elizabeth. Joyce doesn't know that Rob was a KGB agent and believed he was a drug dealer. Joyce gives Philip the note and, using a liquid solution, Philip finds a name and number. Gregory probes Philip about his feelings for Elizabeth, revealing that they had a relationship, even when Elizabeth was pregnant with Paige (Holly Taylor). Philip ignores this. Gregory suggests they kill Joyce before their cover is blown, but Philip threatens Gregory's life if he harms her. Philip goes for a walk and meets his and Elizabeth's new KGB supervisor, Claudia (Margo Martindale), who tells him that the Americans are working on some sort of technology that would put the Soviets' nuclear arsenal at risk. She tells him to make contact with the person mentioned in Rob's note. Philip confronts Elizabeth about her affair with Gregory, telling her that he wouldn't lie about their relationship. He then goes to meet Rob's contact in a warehouse basement. He is brought into a room with two guards and Rob's contact. Philip takes out the guards after they refuse to stay out of his blind spot. Philip is cut by one of the guards, but ignores it. Rob's contact hands him a briefcase with classified schematics for a nuclear X-ray laser anti-ballistic missile ray. Stan and Amador retrace their steps to see how Joyce escaped. Stan notices one of Gregory's men watching them and he and Amador chase him, but he disappears. Stan wonders, \\"Why does some guy in the hood care about a KGB spy?\\" Joyce begins to fear for her life when she realizes that Philip, Elizabeth, and Gregory are spies. Elizabeth assures her that they will not kill her. Later, they take Joyce and her child and hand them over to Claudia, where she tells Joyce they're sending her to Cuba. The next morning, Elizabeth reveals to Philip the extent of her relationship with Gregory — that she fell in love with him when she saw how dedicated he was to their cause. Elizabeth tells Philip that while she didn't fall in love with him when they first met, she feels she's falling in love with him now. In Donetsk, Russia, Rob and Joyce's child is brought to Rob's parents. Stan finds Joyce's dead body in a car, staged to look like an accidental heroin overdose. Production The episode was written by Joel Fields and directed by Thomas Schlamme. Joe Weisberg, the series creator, originally came up with a list of agents whom the characters of Philip and Elizabeth have recruited or could recruit later in the series, with one of the more compelling agents being Gregory, whom Elizabeth recruited right after arriving in America in the mid-1960s. As Fields was writing the episode, he expanded upon Weisberg's idea to include a romantic relationship between Elizabeth and Gregory: \\"This woman, who had been unable to be honest with her husband, could be honest with this man that she had recruited. It became a way for her character to be humanized and softened, and that evolved.\\" Fields considers \\"Gregory\\" as one of his favorites from the first season: \\"Tommy Schlamme directed that episode. Very powerful.\\" Reception In its original American broadcast on February 13, 2013, \\"Gregory\\" was watched by 1.65 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings. The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, commenting \\"'Gregory' was a little slower moving and less viscerally exciting than the first two episodes, but I really liked it all the same.\\" Alan Sepinwall, TV critic for HitFix, commended the episode, stating that it was best episode out of the first three episodes: \\"[T]he way \\"Gregory\\" dealt with the complicated questions of the Jennings marriage — and their ongoing mission in America — really impressed me. I was already confident in \\"The Americans\\" based on the first two installments, but this one has sealed the deal.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz, reviewing for Vulture, declared \\"Gregory\\" as the best episode of season 1, with the episode \\"Only You\\", which also features Gregory, as the second best. He stated that \\"Gregory\\" is \\"a marvel: expertly paced, with a marvelous control of tone, strong performances, and a number of unexpectedly piercing scenes\\", while also validating his thought about how \\"The Americans isn't mainly about espionage, just as The Sopranos wasn't mainly about the mob.\\" References External links * * Category:The Americans (season 1) episodes Category:2013 American television episodes ","title":"Gregory (The Americans)"},{"id":"39025724","text":"Exterior of the Education in Zion Gallery Education in Zion is an exhibition space in the Joseph F. Smith Building at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, United States. The gallery and permanent exhibition documents the history and heritage of education in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from Joseph Smith to the current Church Educational System (CES). Education in Zion includes stories, film, artwork, photographs, and letters. Temporary exhibits have shown student artwork, information about university services, the history of specific CES schools and colleges, and connections between academic subjects and scriptures. The gallery hosts a number of recurring events and lectures. Students viewing the exhibition have felt a renewed appreciation for their education. History of Education in Zion \\"Ascent of Church Education\\" permanent exhibit Detail of the Nauvoo, IL, exhibit Over the course of eight years, C. Terry Warner, directed the planning and execution of the initial exhibition. The exhibition was planned to reside in the Joseph F. Smith building, and architects planned to have the gallery space on the east side of the building. BYU professor John Rosenberg described the gallery space as \\"an anchor that knots the work carried out in the square to the eternal verities of the gospel.\\" Warner led a large team of BYU students and recent graduates who drew from various primary sources in their research for the exhibition about the founders of BYU and CES. Researchers used material from the Church History Library and the L. Tom Perry Special Collections, as well as the archives of the University of Utah, Utah State Historical Society, and the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers. After compiling the stories, the research team planned, wrote, designed, and installed the material in the exhibition. Education in Zion opened in fall 2008 and is under the direction of the Harold B. Lee Library. Ann Lambson was the curator from 2008 to 2011, with Heather Seferovich being the curator since 2011. The permanent exhibits cover the history of the Church Educational System, including education in the early LDS church and the formation of LDS seminaries and institutes. Stories show the sacrifice and the innovation of church members who worked to support the LDS Church’s efforts to educate its members. BYU student employees work as educators in the gallery, giving tours and assisting in the planning of gallery programs. In 2009, the gallery had over 18,000 visitors, with over 28,000 in 2012. Many students who viewed the exhibition expressed greater appreciation for their education and felt inspired in their studies. New permanent exhibits were opened in 2019, focusing on how LDS Church programs have supported its members in gaining secular and spiritual knowledge as represented by the square and the circle, respectively. Temporary exhibits Temporary exhibits in Education in Zion highlight collaborations with BYU colleges and institutions. BYU art students have displayed work in the gallery in numerous exhibits. The gallery featured student art in the 2009 exhibit \\"Clarity\\" and the 2010 exhibit \\"Inheritance\\" showed works inspired by students's educational inheritance. Another student exhibit, \\"After Eve\\", showed art about women in education. Exhibits have helped to promote the university mascot and university services. A 2015 exhibit on Cosmo the Cougar called \\"Cosmo: The Credentials of a Cougar\\" connected the BYU mascot's traits to the official aims of the BYU education; the following year \\"Cosmo:The Evolution of a Cougar\\" showed how Cosmo's costumes have changed over time. The exhibit on the university's Center for Service and Learning, \\"Y Serve: Come Serve with Me\\" emphasized the importance of service as one of BYU's official aims. Another exhibit called \\"Do Good Better: The Ballard Center for Economic Self-Reliance\\" underscored the importance of organizations like the Ballard Center and how students can contribute to such organizations. Other temporary exhibits detail more of the CES's history. The exhibit, \\"Hastening the Work: The Story of Benemerito\\" educated visitors on the history of Benemerito De Las Americas, the private high school in Mexico run by the LDS church. In conjunction with the BYU College of Nursing in 2012, the gallery showed an exhibit on the nursing profession in history, with a special emphasis on LDS topics, like the additional verses of \\"Lord I Would Follow Thee\\" written for the College of Nursing. For the BYU College of Humanities's 50th anniversary, \\"50 Years of Fluency in the Human Conversation\\" showed the importance and history of the humanities at BYU. Exhibits also connect academic subjects to scripture. \\"Bodies Filled With Light\\" paired research on scriptural references to the body with anatomical drawings from the 30th edition of Gray's Anatomy. The 2017 exhibit, \\"Emotions in the Scriptures,\\" documents emotions in scripture and reflects on what these scriptures teach about emotions. Recurring events The gallery has a number of recurring events during the fall and winter semesters: each Friday at noon, students perform live music in the gallery, and each Monday, special programs are prepared for small groups and promoted as Family Home Evening activities. As part of the Family Home Evening activities, there is a Christmas in Nauvoo program in December and \\"Vignettes of Black Saints\\" program in February. In 2016, the Christmas in Nauvoo program included activity stations with 19th-century folk dancing, refreshments, storytelling, and games. Since 2014, the gallery has participated in an annual \\"Night at the Museums\\" event in February, along with BYU's other museums. The gallery also celebrates Karl G. Maeser's birthday on January 16. Lectures For Black history month in 2012, Margaret Blair Young gave a lecture on prominent Black saints, and in 2014 LeGrand Richards lectured on Karl G. Maeser for the Maeser birthday celebration. Other lecturers have included music professor Ron Saltmarsh, sociology professor Mikaela Dufur, and chemistry professor Joshua Price.

It is one of the most important educational institutions of Northeastern Brazil and has been recognized for its achievements in research and large contribution to public health – with more than 600,000 free care procedures performed in 2012. Bahiana currently offers seven undergraduate courses and post-graduate programs in several fields of health sciences. The school is maintained by the Fundação Bahiana para Desenvolvimento das Ciências (Bahian Foundation for Science Development).  History  After noticing the health care needs of Bahian society in the beginning of the 1950s, a group of doctors, academics, public managers and religious leaders from Salvador ideated a new institution. At that time, the only medical school in the state was the Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia, which graduated 130 professionals per year. Facing such a situation, Antônio Simões da Silva Freitas, Orlando de Castro Lima, Jorge Valente, Aristides Novis Filho, Adelaido Ribeiro, Antônio Souza Lima Machado, Colombo Moreira Spínola, Urcício Santiago, André Negreiros Falcão, Francisco Pinheiro Lima Junior, Manoel Aquino Barbosa and René Alfredo Guimarães created the Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saúde Pública. On May 31, 1952, they signed the minutes that established the Fundação Bahiana para Desenvolvimento das Ciências, whose mission was to support and provide funds for the new school - that would be located at the same building of the Santa Izabel Hospital, in Nazaré's district. The first group of teachers was chosen on January 1953. Admission exams were taken on April 14 of the same year. Later that month, Aristides Novis Filho gave the first lessons for the Medicine course. The first class graduated in 1958. During the following decades, Bahiana expanded its activities to provide public health care assistance. In the 70’s, an area of 6,500 m² was bought in Brotas neighborhood. Years later, the building of the former Santa Terezinha Preventorium was bought to place Bahiana’s first health care centre, the Ambulatório Docente-Assistencial da Bahiana (ADAB). In 1998, a new building situated near ADAB was built to become Bahiana’s second campus: the Brotas Academic Unit. In 1999, Bahiana opened the Cabula Academic Unit, located in a vaste green space in the district of Cabula. It is dedicated to some free of charge health services.  Academic units  Bahiana’s academic activities are held in two units, located in the districts of Brotas and Cabula.  Brotas  At the Brotas Academic Unit, there are held undergraduate and postgraduate programs activities. Near it, it is located the Ambulatório Docente-Assistencial da Bahiana, where a multidisciplinary team of professionals, teachers and students from diverse fields work together to provide free health care services.  Cabula  Cabula’s academic unit is the home for the Biomedicine, Medicine, Dentistry and Nursery courses. Built on a green area with 70,000 m², it hosts the majority of Bahiana’s main events, such as the Mostra Científica e Cultural (Science and Culture Exhibition), the Pedagogic Forum, the Nursery, Biomedicine and Dentistry journeys, admission exams and freshman welcome receptions.  Undergraduate programs  * Medicine * Physical therapy * Psychology * Dentistry * Biomedicine * Nursery * Physical Education  Post-Graduate programs  Bahiana offers several post-graduate courses, including Master of Science and Doctoral programs. The school also has 32 research groups registered on CNPq Lattes platform.  Admissions  Since 2008, undergraduates have to pass through an admission process called Processo Seletivo Formativo (PROSEF), which allows them to experience their future profession and interact with teachers and classmates.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on February 27, 2013. Plot Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell), posing as a security company inspector, goes to the home of Adam Dorwin (Michael Countryman), an anti-ballistics program contractor who has recently lost his wife. Elizabeth asks if he had received communications from foreign agents, and he assures her he hadn't even told his wife about his job. Dorwin is revealed to be a KGB agent, whom Elizabeth was subtly prompting to call his handler. After she leaves, Dorwin proceeds to call his handler, Vasili Nikolaevich (Peter Von Berg) from the Soviet embassy. Dorwin says that he is losing it and Vasili says that they will meet soon. The FBI hears that Dorwin may be ready to spy for them, as he is becoming uneasy. Elizabeth meets Claudia (Margo Martindale) and tells her that, if pressed harder, Dorwin would have told her everything. Claudia tells her that Dorwin had sent four signals for a meet in the last week, but no meet took place because FBI surveillance teams are using new encryption on their radios, so Russian agents can't tell when they're being followed. Claudia then tells Elizabeth about an agent she ran in West Germany – a loner whom she befriended. One day, they didn't need him any more, so he killed himself. Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) convinces Nina (Annet Mahendru) to find out what is going on with Dorwin. Nina performs oral sex on Vasili for information. He tells her that Dorwin simply has the \\"jitters.\\" Stan is hurt when Nina tells him how she got Vasili to talk. Elizabeth finds and seduces the FBI contractor of the encryption cards hidden in the trunks of FBI vehicles. He begins to beat her with his belt and Elizabeth, pretending to be scared, begs him to stop. When Philip (Matthew Rhys) sees the marks on her back, he is furious and tells Elizabeth that he'll deal with the contractor. Elizabeth is insulted, stating: \\"If I wanted to deal with him, you don't think he'd be dealt with?\\" On their mission, Philip and Elizabeth argue in the car about the FBI contractor. Elizabeth confirms that FBI agents are tailing them two cars behind. Philip brakes suddenly, causing the FBI vehicle to rear-end an elderly woman's car in between them. The FBI agents go to a garage to get their car repaired, while Philip pretends to need repairs on his vehicle. His car is placed on an adjacent lift. While both cars are on lifts and Philip is distracting the mechanic and FBI agents below the cars, Elizabeth, hiding in the trunk of Philip's car, gets out and, out of view, climbs into the FBI agents' trunk. She finds the encryption card she needs, but is unable to leave as the car has been fixed. She is driven in the trunk to the FBI headquarters, but escapes and meets Philip outside. Stan is at home learning Russian by tape when his wife, Sandra (Susan Misner), tries to bring him to bed, but he declines. She reminds him of happier times, but he declines again and continues to listen to the tape. The next day, Nina, in Vasili's office giving him oral sex under his desk, overhears Arkady Ivanovich (Lev Gorn) tell Vasili that they have the encryption codes. Vasili tells him to organize a meet for the next day with Dorwin. Nina tells Stan this and the FBI has the codes changed. Hearing static, Arkady tells Vasili that the FBI must have changed the codes and that Dorwin may be leading him into a trap. Vasili goes anyway, leading the FBI to follow him. At the same time, Dorwin is in another location. He is shot in the head and killed by Elizabeth. Philip meets Claudia, who tells him that there is a mole working for the FBI.

Prior to the invasion, war with the Khwarazmian dynasty and the usurpation of power by the Naiman prince Kuchlug had weakened the Qara Khitai. When Kuchlug besieged Almaliq, a city belonging to the Karluks, vassals of the Mongol Empire, Genghis Khan dispatched a force under command of Jebe to pursue Kuchlug. After his force of 30,000 was defeated by Jebe at the Khitan capital Balasagun, Kuchlug faced rebellions over his unpopular rule, forcing him to flee to modern Afghanistan, where he was captured by hunters in 1218. The hunters turned Kuchlug over to the Mongols, who beheaded him. Upon defeating the Qara Khitai, the Mongols now had a direct border with the Khwarazmian Empire, which they would soon invade in 1219. Background After Genghis Khan defeated the Naimans in 1204, Naiman prince Kuchlug fled his homeland to take refuge among the Qara Khitai. The Gurkhan Yelü Zhilugu welcomed Kuchlug into his empire, and Kuchlug became an advisor and military commander, eventually marrying one of the daughters of Zhilugu. However, during a war with the bordering Khawarzmian dynasty, Kuchlug initiated a coup d'état against Zhilegu. After Kuchlug took power, he allowed Zhilegu to rule the Qara Khitai in name only. When the Gurkhan died in 1213, Kuchlug took direct control of the khanate. Originally a Nestorian, once among the Khitai Kuchlug converted to Buddhism and began persecuting the Muslim majority, forcing them to convert to either Buddhism or Christianity, a move which alienated Kuchlug from most of the population. When Kuchlug besieged the Karluk city of Almaliq, the Karluks, vassals of the Mongol Empire, requested aid from Genghis Khan. Invasion In 1216, after requesting Muhammad II of Khwarazm not to aid Kuchlug, Genghis Khan dispatched general Jebe with two tumens (20,000 soldiers) to deal with the Qara Khitai threat, while sending Subutai with another two tumens on a simultaneous campaign against the Merkits. The two armies traveled alongside each other through the Altai and Tarbagatai Mountains until arriving at Almaliq. At that point, Subutai turned southwest, destroying the Merkits and protecting Jebe's flank against any sudden attacks from Khwarazm. Jebe relieved Almaliq, then moved south of Lake Balkash into the lands of the Qara Khitai, where he besieged the capital of Balasagun. There, Jebe defeated an army of 30,000 troops and Kuchlug fled to Kashgar. Taking advantage of the unrest fomenting under Kuchlug's rule, Jebe gained support from the Muslim populace by announcing that Kuchlug's policy of religious persecution had ended. When Jebe's army arrived at Kashgar in 1217, the populace revolted and turned on Kuchlug, forcing him to flee for his life. Jebe pursued Kuchlug across the Pamir Mountains into Badakhshan in modern Afghanistan. According to Ata-Malik Juvayni, a group of hunters caught Kuchlug and handed him over to the Mongols, who promptly beheaded him. Aftermath With the death of Kuchlug, the Mongol Empire secured control over the Qara Khitai. Another segment of the Qara Khitai, from a dynasty founded by Buraq Hajib, survived in Kirman as vassals of the Mongols, but ceased to exist as an entity during the reign of the Mongol Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü. The Mongols now had a firm outpost in Central Asia directly bordering the Khwarazm Empire. Relations with the Khwarazms would quickly break down, leading to the Mongol invasion of that territory.

Opened in 1976 as an enclosed mall, it was renovated as an outdoor property in 1999. The center's anchor store is Big Lots. The center is now considered a dead mall. History In April 1976, the first tenants for Cherryland Mall were confirmed: a Kmart discount store, a Kroger supermarket, and a branch of Michigan National Bank. Kmart opened in November 1976, followed by Kroger in December. The same month, H. C. Prange Co. (now Younkers) and Sears had been confirmed as the other anchors. The Sears store replaced a catalog merchant located downtown. By late 1977, the rest of the mall was opened. Peripheral development the same year included two smaller strip malls and a Zantigo fast food restaurant. In 1998, plans were announced to demolish the interior mall portion while leaving all four anchors intact. Under these plans, the Sears and Younkers stores would also be expanded. As part of this renovation, Sears expanded its store into the western third of the mall in 1999. When renovation was complete, the center was converted to an outdoor mall. The mall was foreclosed on by Wells Fargo in 2010; also, Tom's Food Market, which had taken over the supermarket space in 1986, closed. In June 2011, the space became Big Lots.

Known for his lush, detailed inklines, Nebres' most prolific period was in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Career Before coming to the United States, Nebres studied fine arts in the Philippines and worked in the Filipino comics industry for such publishers as Bulaklak Publishing, ACE Publications, and Graphic Arts Service (GASI). Shortly after DC Comics editor Joe Orlando and publisher Carmine Infantino's 1971 visit to the Philippines to scout talent, Nebres began working for the American comics industry. His debut for DC was the story \\"The Exterminator\\" in House of Mystery #210 (Jan. 1973) followed by \\"The Witch Doctor's Magic Cloak\\" in House of Secrets #112 (Oct. 1973). From 1973–1977, Nebres was a part of fellow Filipino cartoonist Tony DeZuniga's studio and emigrated to the United States in 1975. Nebres' first Marvel Comics credit was a text article in Savage Tales #6 (Sept. 1974) and he inked the story \\"Dark Asylum\\" in Giant-Size Dracula #5 (June 1975) which was John Byrne's first work for Marvel. (Archive requires scrolldown.) Nebres later drew Doctor Strange, John Carter, Warlord of Mars, Marvel Super Special, and Power Man and Iron Fist and contributed to Marvel's black-and-white magazine line, Curtis Magazines, most notably on Deadly Hands of Kung Fu. From 1980–1983, he drew stories for Warren Publishing's Creepy, Eerie, Vampirella, and 1984 titles. Following his stint at Warren, Nebres worked for Pacific Comics, Archie Comics' short-lived superhero line, and Continuity Comics. Nebres then focused on storyboards and commercial art and largely left the comics industry. In 2000, SQP Inc. published The Art of Rudy Nebres, a collection of fan commissions. Awards Rudy Nebres received an Inkpot Award at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2012. In 2017, Nebres was awarded the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame award for \\"an inking career in American comic books of outstanding accomplishment.\\" Personal life Nebres resides in New Jersey with his wife, Dolores. They have two children, Melvin and Edwin.

Cervantes became Zacatecan state Director of Education in 1950 when he was only 26 years old. He next served as an official within the administration of Zacatecan Governor Francisco E. García from 1956 to 1962. Cervantes would later be elected to the state Chamber of Deputies and then as a federal deputy in the Chamber of Deputies. Cervantes then held a seat in the Senate of the Republic from 1976 until 1980. Governor A member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), was elected Governor of the Mexican state of Zacatecas in 1980 with the support of Mexican President José López Portillo. He served as Governor for one term, ending in 1986. Cervantes was a strong proponent of infrastructure and urban development projects during his tenure. He supported and launched a new gas pipeline connecting neighboring Aguascalientes to Zacateca's second largest city, Fresnillo. He sought to attract new investors and businesses to the cities of Guadalupe and Calera de Víctor Rosales. He was the first Zacatecan Governor to propose a new industrial corridor extending from Ojocaliente to Fresnillo. Cervantes hoped that the new projects would boost jobs and economic growth in the state. Later life He largely stayed out of local politics until the early 2000s. In 2004, Cervantes publicly renounced his membership in the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and left the party. He endorsed gubernatorial candidate Amalia García of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in the 2004 Zacatecan election. Garcia's father had served in Cervantes cabinet during his tenure as governor. Amalia Garcia won the 2004 election over the PRI candidate and was elected governor. Cervantes again criticized the PRI in 2010 over a potential political alliance between the PRI and the Labor Party, which he opposed. However, the proposed alliance never came to fruition.

He served as Vice President, Business Development for Intel Corporation (1984-1999). With Leslie L. Vadász, he co-founded Intel Capital. He led Intel’s initiative to help create and expand residential broadband Internet access. After leaving Intel, he founded The Avram Miller Company, a consulting firm for technology companies. Miller has served as a senior advisor to Lazard, and has served as a director of various companies including CMGI, World Online, PCCW, and entertainment companies including Maxis and King World Productions. Miller is the founding chair of Plugged In, a non-profit computer literacy program for underserved urban youth (1992-1999), a senior advisor to Equal Access (1999-2012) and a trustee of the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) (1998-2002). Early life and education Avram Miller is a San Franciscan from a middle-class Jewish family. After graduating from Drew School, a private high school in San Francisco, in 1963, Miller joined the United States Merchant Marine as a steward. He was active in both the civil rights and anti war movements. Career Langley Porter (1966-1969) Toward the end of 1966, Miller began work at the Langley Porter Institute, University of California San Francisco Medical School, under Joseph Kamiya, PhD, who was a pioneer in the study of biofeedback. Miller developed much of the equipment that was used in this research. Thoraxcenter (1969-1974) In early 1969, Miller joined cardiologist Paul Hugenholtz, who was starting a new cardiovascular institute at Erasmus University Rotterdam, called The Thoraxcenter. His primary task was to build a computer department. Mennen-Greatbatch (1974-1979) Moving with his family to Israel in 1974, Miller joined medical technology manufacturer Mennen-Greatbatch (now Mennen Medical) as founder and director of their computer division. He also was named Adjunct Associate Professor at Tel Aviv University School of Medicine, working in the Department of Cardiology under Professor Henry N. Neufeld. Digital Equipment Corporation (1979-1983) Returning to the United States in 1979, Miller joined the Central Engineering Department of Digital Equipment Corporation. Miller managed the group responsible for hardware development and support of low-end computers. A year later, Ken Olsen, Digital's founder and CEO, chose Miller to head new group dedicated to developing the company's entry into the personal computer market., documentary, Computer History Museum The products were known as the Professional Series. The Professional 350, introduced at the 1982 National Computer Conference in Houston, TX, ran a multiprocessing operating system, a fully bitmapped display, and had built-in Ethernet capability. Franklin Computer (1983-1984) In 1983, Miller became Chief Operating Officer at Franklin Computer Corporation (now Franklin Electronic Publishers, Inc.), an early-stage Apple II clone manufacturer. Miller was later named president. Under Miller, Franklin reached $80 million in sales, but a legal battle with Apple hindered it greatly. Miller left Franklin in April 1984. Intel (1984-1999) and the birth of Intel Capital Miller joined Intel Corporation in August 1984, initially working with \\"The System Group,\\" a division that developed computer systems. Miller reported to Les Vadász, who had led the company’s efforts to develop its first microprocessor. Miller focused on mergers, joint ventures, strategic partnerships and minority investments. In 1988, Miller was named Vice President, Business Development, and later was elected Corporate Vice President by the Intel board. With the approval of Intel CEO Andy Grove, Vadász and Miller created the Corporative Business Development group (CBD), later renamed Intel Capital. Intel Capital became a successful corporative venture group in the technology sector. Miller's group was an investor in Mark Cuban's Broadcast.com, internet infrastructure and security services company Verisign, communications semiconductor maker Broadcom, interactive publications innovator LAUNCH Media, the web-hosting service Geocities, the tech media site CNET and broadband network provider Covad (now part of MegaPath Corporation). Miller's group also invested in CMGI (now ModusLink Global Solutions, Inc.) and PCCW. Development of Residential Broadband In 1992, Miller was asked by Andy Grove to be the Intel point person working with Microsoft to develop a number of consumer initiatives. They sought to develop an interactive set-top box for the cable television industry. This project also involved General Instrument (GI) owned Jerrold, a large supplier of set-tops. Working with Intel and Microsoft was GI CTO Matt Miller (no relation). By the end of 1992, it was determined that an interactive set-top box would be too expensive. With Matt Miller, Avram Miller recognized much of the digital TV technology could be used for high-speed residential broadband connections. GI and Intel began to develop both cable modems and the head-end equipment used as a gateway to the Internet. Speaking to this faster Internet access in 1996, Miller predicted: > \\"It's not about playing cards, it's about talking. It's known as social > computing, people interacting through the personal computer. \\"And I see this > as a major driver to the use of PCs.\\" \\"This will make the PC indispensable > to our lives and it will change the way we communicate,\\" he said. \\"PCs will > be on all the time.\\" Miller organized the first major trials of cable modems with Comcast and Viacom (which then owned a cable business). In 1993, Intel demonstrated working cable modems at The Western Cable Show in Anaheim, CA. Miller got such companies as America Online (AOL) and Prodigy to participate in the broadband trials. Intel then provided the key specification to CableLabs (the research arm of the cable industry), which became the DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) standard. Because the cable industry did not have the technical capabilities to manage an internet business, Miller conceived of a company that would provide these services, and convinced the venture group Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers (KPCB, also known as Kleiner Perkins) to work with the cable industry to create the company @Home Network. Intel would also invest in this high-speed cable Internet service provider. In addition to the development of broadband cable, Miller oversaw Intel’s activities to create high-speed DSL (digital subscriber line) Internet access, working extensively with telephone companies. The Avram Miller Company Miller left Intel in April 1999 to start The Avram Miller Company, a strategy and business development group providing services to Internet companies internationally. In addition, Miller served on the boards of many public (CMGI, World Online, and PCCW) and private companies (Heavy.com), and was a senior advisor to Lazard Frères & Co. (now the Lazard Group LLC). In 2003, Miller was ranked number eight on the Forbes Midas List of the top 100 tech investors. Personal life Miller and his wife live in Sonoma, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel. He has three grown children from his first marriage and four grandsons.

It has been used in the service of France since 1913. It is in the Sauvain and Job communes, with the boundary between the Rhône-Alpes and Auvergne regions passing through the site. There are three towers at the site. The tallest one is a 55-metre-high civilian telecommunication tower owned by . The facility its at the summit of Pierre-sur-Haute at an elevation of , about from the village of Chalmazel. There is a small ski resort near the radio station, with the top of the quad lift sitting less than from the station fence. In April 2013, the French-language Wikipedia article about the station attracted attention from the French interior intelligence agency DCRI, which pressured the president of Wikimedia France into deleting the article. It was promptly restored by another Wikipedia contributor living in Switzerland. Publicity about the affair resulted in the Streisand effect and many thousands of page views. History The optical telegraph station in 1913. In 1913, a semaphore telegraph (French: ') was built where the military radio station is now. At the time, it was a small stone building, with the semaphore on top. In 1961, during the Cold War, NATO asked the French Army to build the station as part of the 82-node transmission network in Europe known as the ACE High system.Jane's Military Communications (1987), cited by In this network, the Pierre-sur-Haute station, or FLYZ, was a relay between the Lachens (FNIZ) station to the south and the Mont-Août (FADZ) station to the north. And The NATO radio station was using American-made tropospheric scatter equipment to relay voice and telegraph signals on a network stretching from Turkey to the Arctic Polar Circle in Norway. The French Air Force took control of the station in 1974. In the late 1980s, the system was gradually replaced by a combination of national defense systems and some NATO-owned subsystems. The large parabolic antennas, known locally as Mickey's ears, were replaced with the current two-antenna setup in 1991. Role The Pierre-sur-Haute station is controlled by the French Air Force and is a subsidiary of the Lyon – Mont Verdun Air Base, from the station. It is one of the four radio stations along France's north-south axis, in constant communication with the three others: Lacaune, Henrichemont and the Rochefort air base. The station is mainly used for transmissions relating to the command of operational units. If French nuclear weapons (force de dissuasion) were used, the fire order might pass through this relay. The station has been part of the ' (Air Command of Surveillance, Information and Communication Systems) since its creation on 1 June 1994; from 1 January 2006, it has been run by the ' (Joint Directorate of Infrastructure Networks and Information Systems). The station is under the command of a major.Which in the French army is a contraction for adjudant- major and is in fact an OR-9 non-commissioned officer About 20 personnel are on-site, including electricians, mechanics, and cooks. Infrastructure Concrete towers housing the military radio equipment at Pierre-sur-Haute The station is situated on a 30-hectare site between the communes of Sauvain and Job, straddling the border between the two departments of Loire and . The perimeter is surrounded by a high barrier of wood and metal. Military staff and employees arrive via road or tracked vehicles. This road is closed to the public. Though access is difficult, the facility is not isolated: the Chalmazel ski slopes are adjacent to the site. Buildings The radio station with a Snowkite in the foreground There are three towers at the site. The tallest one is a 55-metre-high civilian telecommunication tower, owned by Télédiffusion de France. The telecommunication tower is topped by a radome and contains a mode S air traffic control radar beacon system owned by the Directorate General for Civil Aviation. The radar has been in operation since 18 August 2009 but has experienced malfunctions due to heavy snowfall in the area. The two remaining concrete towers are owned by the military. The 30-metre-high structures have been used since 1991 for radio transmission and reception. These are built to withstand the blast of a nuclear explosion. Some buildings are used as garages and living quarters, complete with kitchen, dining room and bedrooms. They are linked together by tunnels, 400 metres in total length, so as to avoid walking through thick snow in winter when moving from one building to the other. Underground facilities The most important part of the site is the underground part, used for transmissions dispatch: at a speed of 2 Mb/s, communications from the towers are analysed, then redirected to be transmitted. This part of the facility is supplied with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defences. It defends against electromagnetic pulses using a Faraday cage. Positively pressured rooms help prevent contaminants from entering the facility. The facility has independent water and power supplies. Controversy over Wikipedia article In April 2013, the French-language Wikipedia article Station hertzienne militaire de Pierre-sur-Haute attracted attention from the French interior intelligence agency DCRI. The agency attempted to have the article about the facility removed from the French-language Wikipedia. After a request for deletion in March 2013, the Wikimedia Foundation had asked the DCRI which parts of the article were causing a problem, noting that the article closely reflected information in a 2004 documentary made by Télévision Loire 7, a French local television station, which is freely available online and had been made with the cooperation of the French Air Force. The DCRI refused to give these details, and repeated its demand for deletion of the article. The DCRI then forced Rémi Mathis, a volunteer administrator of the French-language Wikipedia, and president of Wikimedia France, under threat of detention and arrest, into deleting the article. The article was promptly restored by another Wikipedia contributor living in Switzerland. – Le Monde, 6 April 2013 As a result of the controversy, the article temporarily became the most read page on the French Wikipedia, with more than 120,000 page views during the weekend of 6/7 April 2013, and is now translated to many languages. For his role in the controversy, Mathis was named Wikipedian of the Year by Jimmy Wales at Wikimania 2013.

The game consists entirely of boss battles, featuring five stages with three bosses each. It is the first game from MileStone, a company founded by former Compile employees looking to develop high quality shooters similar to those Compile was known for in the past. After its release in Japanese arcades, it was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and GameCube in Japan. The GameCube version was also released in North America. Critics found the game to be overwhelmingly average, a generic shooter lacking in polish and execution. Gameplay The player battles a boss Chaos Field is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up with consecutive boss battles. The game features five stages, each with three bosses to defeat. The player can choose to play as one of three characters, each with their own ship that has a unique primary weapon: a spread shot, lasers that lock onto enemies, or bolts of lightning. Each ship is equipped with a short-range sword that can destroy bullets and inflict damage on enemy ships. Each player ship also has two special weapons, one being a type of homing weapon that locks onto enemies and the other being a deployable shield that absorbs bullets. The player can flip the environment at will between two parallel worlds, the \\"order field\\" and the \\"chaos field\\". In the chaos field, the player's weapons are more powerful and their special homing weapon can also destroy enemy bullets, but enemies are more ruthless and will fire more bullets. The player only gets one life per credit, but can take several hits before losing a life. Development and release Chaos Field was the first game developed by MileStone Inc.. (Translation ) The company was founded by former Compile employees in 2003 after Compile went bankrupt. Most of the staff originally joined Compile because of the company's good reputation with shooting games like the Aleste series, but were left unsatisfied from Compile's growing focus on other franchises like Puyo Puyo. Desiring to make a shooter of their own, development on Chaos Field began with the founding of MileStone in April 2003. Development was funded by their publisher and from doing subcontract work on other games. According to sound and art designer Daisuke Nagata, the game experienced a troublesome development because too many people were involved and the team lacked organization. The team had a working prototype by September 2003, but scrapped this iteration and started anew when they determined it did not feel right. This version of the game had the player controlling a giant robot flying through stages set in real Japanese cities. Chaos Field was first released in Japanese arcades on May 25, 2004. The team decided to develop Chaos Field for Sega's NAOMI arcade platform since they were experienced with it and had a working relationship with Sega. It received a Dreamcast port in December that year, after the console was already discontinued by Sega. The team also had experience with developing for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, and so created ports for those platforms as well. The GameCube version, Chaos Field Expanded, was released in February 2005 in Japan by Sega, with a North American version published by O~3 Entertainment in December that year. This version features an exclusive mode that adds small waves of enemies between the bosses. Also in December, the PlayStation 2 version titled Chaos Field New Order was released in Japan. The game was re- released in two Wii compilations of MileStone shooters, Ultimate Shooting Collection and MileStone Shooting Collection 2. Reception Critics found Chaos Field to be a generic shooter. IGN wrote that \\"the entire effort screams cookie-cutter design\\" but that it \\"manages to deliver an entertaining dose of gameplay within a completely average looking shooter.\\" Gamezilla and GamesRadar also described the game as \\"standard\\". Several critics compared the game unfavorably to other shoot 'em up, particularly another GameCube shooter, Ikaruga (2001). Some only recommended Chaos Field to hardcore fans of the genre. Some journalists criticized the poor execution and lack of features. GamesRadar and GameSpot wrote that the collision detection did not feel right, with GameSpot saying the game \\"lacks the ultra precise action and feel that's crucial to any truly great shoot-'em-up.\\" Nintendo World Report wrote that the game felt unbalanced, and along the same lines, Edge and GamesTM wrote that the game felt rushed and lacked polish. The graphics were criticized as generic and the sound effects on the GameCube version were described as almost nonexistent. GamesTM wrote that the game lacks the \\"refinement and accessibility\\" of other shooters. Some criticized the lack of a two-player mode and online ranking system.

He became well known in 2011 by posting old video clips of politicians, often of them making statements contrary to their current political positions, to YouTube. He was described as \\"the [2012] Republican primaries' most influential amateur opposition researcher\\". He was hired by BuzzFeed in December 2011. He has appeared on MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, NPR, PBS, and C-SPAN. On October 3, 2016, Kaczynski announced he was leaving BuzzFeed and joining CNN.  Early life  At 19, Kaczynski had a bout of pancreatitis, leading him to eschew smoking and alcohol. He has worked as an intern for the Republican National Committee, and was an intern in 2011 in the office of Congressman Bob Turner. Kaczynski attended college at Ohio University, but got involved with political reporting, and then transferred to St. Johns University to study early American history. He enrolled in online courses to meet his degree requirement, but did not eventually graduate. Kaczynski got his start by e-mailing reporters' tip boxes with clips he found of politicians contradicting themselves.  Career  In March 2012, Kaczynski uncovered numerous clips of Mitt Romney supporting an individual mandate, contradicting his then-current campaign position. He also uncovered a clip of Barack Obama protesting at Harvard while at law school over a lack of faculty diversity.  Work at Buzzfeed  In November 2013, Kaczynski reported that Kentucky Senator Rand Paul had plagiarized sections of a speech he gave in June 2013 on immigration from the Wikipedia article of the movie Stand and Deliver. Kaczynski subsequently reported Paul's 2012 book Government Bullies also contained passages that were plagiarized from articles from the right-wing think tank Heritage Foundation and from the libertarian Cato Institute. Further reports by Kaczynski revealed another four instances of plagiarism from an article by Case Western Reserve University professor Jonathan H. Adler and Pacific Legal Foundation attorney Timothy Sandefur. Another section of the book was discovered to be plagiarized from an article written in Forbes Magazine. The next year, Kaczynski continued with a series of articles chronicling politicians' plagiarism. Kaczynski found more than a dozen examples of politicians running for office in 2014 copying their plans and issues pages verbatim from other candidates. In January 2017, Kaczynski reported that Monica Crowley had plagiarized large sections of her 2012 book What The (Bleep) Just Happened. The publisher, HarperCollins, announced they would stop selling the book. The Trump Administration tapped Crowley to serve as senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. In May 2017, he reported that Sheriff David Clarke had plagiarized portions of his master's thesis. Following the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013, he played a role in spreading unsubstantiated misinformation about the identities of the suspected bombers when he retweeted false reports made by Reddit user Greg Hughes.\\"The Anatomy of a Misinformation Disaster\\". The Atlantic. Retrieved 25 July 2013.\\"Should Reddit Be Blamed for the Spreading of a Smear?\\" The New York Times Magazine. Retrieved 25 July 2013. In 2015, Politico reported Kaczynski was leading internal opposition research at BuzzFeed looking to dig up dirt on politicians. NPR reported Kaczynski's team dug up clips of Donald Trump saying he supported – despite statements to the contrary – the Iraq War; a clip of Hillary Clinton referring to some children as \\"super predators\\"; a video of Ben Carson saying he believed the pyramids were used to store grain; and a video of Bernie Sanders proclaiming his support for Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Kaczynski subsequently found clips of Donald Trump supporting the 2011 American intervention in Libya, the toppling of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, and pushing for US action to protect Iranian protesters. Clips Kaczynski found of Donald Trump on the Howard Stern Show were used in both Democratic and Republican attack ads against Trump and as the basis of a question in the first general election Presidential debate of 2016. During the US campaign for president in 2016, Kaczynski brought to attention a statement by the chairman of the American Nazi Party in support of Republican candidate Donald Trump on the grounds that \\"if Trump does win ... it's going to be a real opportunity for people like white nationalists.\\"  Work at CNN  On October 3, 2016, Kaczynski and his team announced they were leaving BuzzFeed and joining CNN. In January 2017, Kaczynski surfaced audio of Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of labor, Andrew Puzder, describing the employees hired at his restaurants as the \\"best of the worst\\". Puzder later withdrew due to other reasons, and did not join the administration. On July 4, 2017, Kaczynski controversially reported he used \\"identifying information\\" to find the identity of a Reddit user who created an anti-CNN video meme President Donald Trump tweeted two days prior, using a Facebook search to find them. The Reddit user had a history of racist, anti-Muslim, and anti-Semitic postings. Kaczynski reported the creator's identity would be withheld by CNN, since the creator was a private citizen, and because he had issued an \\"extensive apology\\".

Commercial and residential areas Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui and Causeway Bay are found to be the most severe areas of light pollution. Due to the spotlights and LED billboards, Hong Kong’s sky is many times brighter than other cities. Background The issue of light pollution in Hong Kong rose to public prominence in 2008,Task force suggests voluntary scheme to curb light pollution, EJ Insight, 23 April 2015 and the government initiated a policy review the following year, culminating in the 2011-2015 \\"Task Force on External Lighting\\" to look into the problem, including two rounds of public consultation in 2013. It recommended that no rules or legislation should be introduced, as there was “no 'majority' opinion on the issue”. In April 2016, the government followed the task force's suggestion to introduce merely a voluntary \\"Charter on External Lighting\\" under which businesses might agree to turn off external lighting between 11pm and 6am. Separately, the topic also gained academic interest. The Department of Physics at the University of Hong Kong took measurements from a number of locations in Hong Kong and ranked them against a benchmark of \\"normal dark sky\\", and found that the highest level of light pollution was the Hong Kong Tsim Sha Tsui was on average 1000 times brighter than the benchmark, and the worst reading in the world. Apart from that, a survey by four students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts discovered that the light of the neon signs from buildings in Causeway Bay was 176 lux bright and Mong Kok was about 150 to 500 lux, which is far higher than British agencies recommend. Even at the Wetland Park in Tin Shui Wai, the brightness was 130 times higher than the International Astronomical Union standard. The rise of complaints also reveals the seriousness of the problem. The number of complaints has increased from 87 in 2007 to 377 in 2009. In brief, the problem of light pollution has not only appeared in commercial areas like Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, but also in the residential areas outside the urban centre. Cheng Sze-ling, environment affairs officer of Friends of the Earth, said “Light pollution is no longer endemic but has evolved into an infectious disease across the city.” A Symphony of Lights, a show for tourists, has been criticised for contributing to light pollution. Effects Sha Tin On neighbourhoods In heavily mixed residential developments such as Mong Kok and Sham Shui Po, some residents have trouble sleeping as they have strong neon lights shining through their bedroom windows, emitted by billboards. Some precincts have been described as being lit up like football stadiums. On human beings Excessive amounts of light can disrupt the biological clock of humans and affect their brains and hormone function. On the environment In the remote Sai Kung countryside, the light emitted from giant LED billboards in the City can affect the breeding of Fireflies, an insect relying on light signals to mate. According to the Hong Kong Entomological Society chairman Yiu Vor, they emit their signal less frequently, affecting their continuing survival. Voluntary guidelines on external lighting As Hong Kong’s commercial and residential areas are not strictly separated, it is difficult to combat light pollution as no simple regulation rule can be applied to these merged zones. The government currently imposes no laws to regulate excessive lighting. Instead, a Task Force on External Lighting set up by the Environment Bureau has issued the Guidelines on Industry Best Practices for External Lighting Installations. However, it is carried out on a voluntary basis by the industry and is thus criticized as toothless. The lawmakers are still investigating the need to set up specific laws in regulating external lighting. Yet, opinions are divided. While residents generally welcome the idea, the tourism and advertising industries both rely on lighting to boost business. Some opponents to a \\"lights-out\\" argue that the beautiful night view is a unique feature of Hong Kong that should not be lost through legislation. In 2015, the Task Force on External Lighting's recommendation that light pollution in Hong Kong be tackled by a voluntary charter, saying that it found Hong Kong was not yet ready for a legislative solution to the issue, was met with great disappointment from the Legislative Council committee on environmental affairs. The task force recommended a two-year scheme in which merchants will be asked to turn off outdoor lighting voluntary by 11 pm. Committee chairman Kenneth Chan said that the government had obviously given in to pressure from the commercial sector, which was opposed to any curbs on external lighting.

Yaguarí creek is a narrow deep channel between Vizcaíno island and Lobos Island, and is the main river mouth of the Negro river. History The first European settlement on the island came when Jesuits founded the mission of Santo Domingo de Soriano on Isla Vizcaino in 1624, though the mission later relocated to the mainland.  Economy and population  The population began significantly increasing when Pedro Millán began businesses on the island and transferred supplies from other towns. However, the population left the island to escape floods, and they migrated to what is now known as Villa Soriano. They also migrated in order to escape the attacks by hostile indigenous people.  Indigenous residents  Many native islanders were very protective over their area and were hostile to other people living on the island. Archaeologists have found evidence that the native indigenous population has significantly decreased in the small village of San Miguel del Río Negro.

The city is located along the Moldefjorden and the river Molde. The city is the largest urban and commercial centre of the Romsdal region as well as the administrative centre of Molde Municipality and of Møre og Romsdal county. The Church of Norway's Diocese of Møre is also based at the Molde Cathedral. Molde has a maritime, temperate climate, with cool-to-warm summers, and relatively mild winters. It is nicknamed The Town of Roses. It is an old settlement that emerged as a trading post in the late Middle Ages. Formal trading rights as a shipping port were granted in 1614, and the town was incorporated through a royal charter in 1742. Molde Municipality was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The town continued to grow throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, becoming a centre for the Norwegian textile and garment industry, as well as the administrative centre for the region, and a major tourist destination. After World War II, Molde experienced accelerated growth, merging with Bolsøy Municipality and parts of Veøy Municipality and Nord-Aukra Municipality on 1 January 1964, making the municipality much larger than the urban area of the town of Molde. On 1 January 2020, the municipality was expanded again through the incorporation of the neighboring municipalities of Midsund and Nesset. The town has a population (2019) of 21,103 and a population density of . Name The town is named after the original settlement on the farmstead of Molde (). The name is the plural form of either mold which means \\"fertile soil\\" or ' which means \\"skull\\" or \\"mold\\" (thus in reference to the rounded peaks in Moldemarka). Pronunciation varies between the standard Molde and the rural Molle. A person from Molde will refer to him/herself as a Moldenser or 'Moldensar. History Illustration of Molde, painting by Nico Wilhelm Jungmann, 1904 The town's current location dates from the late medieval period, but is preceded by the early medieval settlement on the nearby island of Veøya, an island to the south of present-day town of Molde. The settlement at Veøya probably dates from the Migration Period, but is first mentioned in the sagas by Snorri Sturluson as the location of the Battle of Sekken in 1162, where king Håkon the Broad-shouldered was killed fighting the aristocrat Erling Skakke, during the Norwegian civil wars. However, settlement in the area can be traced much further back in time-- evidence given by two rock slabs carved with petroglyphs found at Bjørset, west of the city centre. At the eve of the 15th century, the influence of Veøya waned, and the island was eventually deserted. However, commercial life in the region was not dead, and originating from the two settlements at Reknes and Molde (later Moldegård), a minor port called Molde Fjære (Molde Landing) emerged, based on trade with timber and herring to foreign merchants. Molde's main street and commercial centre. Molde Cathedral (orange roof on far right) with its freestanding bell tower replaced the church that was destroyed during World War II The town gained formal trading rights in 1614 as a ladested under the guidance of the city of Trondheim. During the Swedish occupation of Middle Norway, 1658–1660, after Denmark-Norway's devastating defeat in the Northern Wars, the town became a hub of resistance to the Swedes. After the rebellion and liberation in 1660, Molde became the administrative centre of Romsdalen Amt and was incorporated as a kjøpstad through a royal charter in 1742. Molde continued to grow throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, becoming a centre for Norwegian textile and garment industry. Tourism later became a major industry, and Molde saw notabilities such as the German emperor Wilhelm II of Germany and the Prince of Wales as regular summer visitors. Molde consisted of luxurious hotels surrounding an idyllic township with quaint, wooden houses, lush gardens and parks, esplanades and pavilions, earning it the nickname the Town of Roses. This was interrupted when one third of the city was destroyed in a fire on 21 January 1916. However, Molde recovered and continued to grow in the economically difficult interbellum period. A second fire, or series of fires, struck from the German air-raids in April and May 1940, which destroyed about two thirds of the town. Molde was in effect the capital of Norway for a week after King Haakon, Crown Prince Olav, and members of the government and parliament arrived at Molde on April 23, after a dramatic flight from Oslo. They were put up at Glomstua, then at the western outskirts of the town, and experienced the bombing raids personally. The Norwegian gold reserve was also conveyed to Molde, and was hidden in a clothing factory. However, German intelligence was well aware of this, and on April 25 the Luftwaffe initiated a series of air-raids. For a week the air-raid siren on the chimney of the dairy building announced the repeated attacks. April 29 turned out to be the worst day in the history of Molde, as the city was transformed into a sea of flames by incendiary bombs. Until then the church had escaped undamaged, but in the final sortie a firebomb became stuck high up in the tower, and the beautiful wooden church was obliterated by fire. After World War II, Molde experienced tremendous growth. As the modernisation of the Norwegian society accelerated in the post-reconstruction years, Molde became a centre for not only administrative and public services, but also academic resources and industrial output. After the consolidation of the town itself and its adjacent communities in 1964, Molde became a modern city, encompassing most branches of employment, from farming and fisheries, to industrial production, banking, higher education, tourism, commerce, health care, and civil administration. Municipality The city of Molde was established as an urban municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). It was surrounded by the rural municipality of Bolsøy. On 1 July 1915, a part of Bolsøy (population: 183) was transferred to the city of Molde. On 1 January 1952, another part of Bolsøy (population: 1,913) was transferred to Molde. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the town of Molde (population: 8,289) merged with the Sekken, Veøya, and Nesjestranda parts of municipality of Veøy (population: 756), all of Bolsøy municipality (population: 7,996), and the Mordal area of Nord-Aukra municipality (population: 77) to form the present day municipality of Molde, making the municipality much larger than the town. On 1 January 2020, the neighbouring municipalities of Midsund and Nesset will be merged with Molde to form a much larger municipality called Molde. Geography View of Molde from the Molde archipelago. Molde proper consists of a and strip of urban land running east–west along the north shore of the Moldefjord, an arm of the Romsdalsfjord, on the Romsdal peninsula. The city is sheltered by the island of Bolsøya and the Molde archipelago, a chain of low- lying islands and islets, to the south, and the wood-clad hills of Moldemarka to the north. The city centre is located just west of the river Moldeelva, which runs into the city from the north, originating in the Moldevatnet lake, through the valley Moldedalen. Despite the river being minor and seasonal, it supported several sawmills in the 16th- and 17th centuries. This gave rise to the original town itself through a combination of a good harbour, proximity to the sea routes, vast timber resources, and a river capable of supporting mills. In 1909, the river housed the first hydro electric power plant capable of providing sufficient electricity for the city, and the upper reaches of the river still provide drinking water for most of the city. Its panoramic view of some 222 partly snow-clad peaks, usually referred to as the Molde panorama, is one of Molde's main attractions, and has drawn tourists to the city since the 19th century. Molde is nicknamed the Town of Roses, a name which originated during Molde's era as a tourist destination of international fame in the late 19th century. Moldemarka Moldemarka, the hilly woodland area located immediately north of the town, is public land. The area has an extensive network of paths, walking trails and skiing tracks. Forest roads enter the area from several directions. Bulletin boards and maps provide information regarding local plants and wildlife, as well as signposts along the trails. Marked trails lead to a number of peaks, sites and fishing lakes and rivers. A national fishing license is required to fish in the lakes and streams. Varden, above sea level is a viewpoint directly above Molde, with a good view of the city, the fjord with the Molde archipelago and the Molde panorama. Climate The town of Molde has a maritime, temperate climate, with cool- to-warm summers, and relatively mild winters. The annual precipitation is medium high, with an average of per year. The warmest season is late summer. Molde holds the national high for the month of October, with (on 11 October 2005). The driest season is May–June. Due to its geographic location, Molde experiences frequent snowfalls in winter, but this snow is usually wet as the winters tend to be mild. Due to the effects of the Gulf Stream, the city rarely experiences lasting cold spells, and the average temperature is well above the average for its latitude. A natural phenomenon occurring in Molde and the adjacent areas, are frequent winter days with temperatures above , sometimes even above . This is due to the foehn wind from south and south- east. Combined with a steady influx of warm, moist south-westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean, warmed by the North Atlantic Current, it gives Molde a climate much warmer than its latitude would indicate. The sheltered location of the city, facing south with hills to the north, mountains to the east and mountainous islands to the west, contributes to Molde's climate and unusually rich plant life, especially among species naturally growing on far lower latitudes, like maple, chestnut, oak, tilia (lime or linden), beech, yew, and others. Education Molde University College offers a wide range of academic opportunities, from nursing and health-related studies, to economics and administrative courses. The school is Norway's leading college in logistics, and well established as a centre for research and academic programmes in information technology, with degrees up to and including PhD. Transportation The Hurtigruta ship stops at Molde every day, on its journey between the cities of Bergen and Kirkenes. The nearest railway station is Åndalsnes, the terminus for the Rauma Line. The city's airport at Årø has several daily flights to Oslo, Bergen, and Trondheim, as well as weekly flights to other domestic and international destinations. Culture Festivals The Moldejazz jazz festival is held in Molde every July. Moldejazz is one of the largest and oldest jazz festivals in Europe, and one of the most important. An estimated 40,000 tickets are sold for the more than a hundred events during the festival. Between 80,000 and 100,000 visitors visit the city during the one-week-long festival. Byfest, the city's celebration of incorporation, is an arrangement by local artists, coinciding with the anniversary of the royal charter of 29 June 1742. Sports Molde hosts a variety of sports teams, most notably the football team, Molde FK, which plays in the Eliteserien, the top division in the Norwegian football league system. Their home matches are played at Aker stadion, inaugurated in 1998, which holds a record attendance of 13,308. The team is three-time league champions (2011, 2012 and 2014), four-time Norwegian Cup winners (1994, 2005, 2013 and 2014), and has made numerous appearances in European tournaments, including the UEFA Champions League. The club was founded in 1911, during Molde's period of great British and Continental influx, and was first named \\"International\\", since it predominantly played teams made up from crews of foreign vessels visiting the city. In addition to a number of international players, the city has also produced several ski jumpers, cross-country skiers and alpine skiers of international merit. Other sports include the accomplished team handball clubs (SK Træff, SK Rival), athletics teams (IL Molde-Olymp), skiing clubs, basketball and volleyball teams.

It is traditionally eaten by new mothers in Guangzhou to restore strength and health, and is presented to friends and family to indicate the arrival of a new baby. Legend Pork Knuckles and Ginger Stew According to legend in the early Ming DynastyLin Shaoyong, \\"The legend of Pork Knuckles and Ginger Stew\\", The legend states: \\"Guangdong Yangcheng Evening News\\", 17/1/2009 there lived a butcher who had the good fortune to marry a very pretty, kind and gumptious girl. However, their happiness was broken by the fact that even after several years of marriage, the wife was still without child. Now in traditional Chinese feudalism, there are three unfilial sins, and of these failure to bear a descendant to carry the family name is by far the most unforgivable. Therefore, the butcher’s mother forced the two to divorce. The wife was heartbroken, leaving the family home she moved to a hut on a hill. However to her own surprise she found that she was now pregnant. The butcher still loved his wife and visited her. When he received the news of her pregnancy, he was afraid that his wife and the newborn would be malnourished, so he brought her some unsold pork knuckles and stewed them in sweet black vinegar in a big pot together with ginger and eggs. After several years, the child finally grew up. The wife forgave the butcher’s mother and returned with her son to the marital home and asked her son to take with him a pot of sweet vinegar stew as a gift for his grandmother. His grandmother was elated to receive him and the stew. Thereafter, whenever a baby is born, the family will make a pot of sweet vinegar stew and share it with friends and neighbors. Tradition Pork Knuckles and Ginger Stew is not an everyday Chinese cuisine. It is a traditional postnatal therapeutic food in the Guangzhou region of China, eaten to aid the recovery of new mothers after giving birth. It helps in the recovery of maternal health from the fatigue of pregnancy in the first forty days of post-partum confinementPat Chun, \\"New babies : information for expecting mothers\\", Pat Chun International Limited\\",25/10/2012 known in Cantonese as choyut (坐月).Howzit Hong Kong, \\"Pork Knuckles & Ginger Stew\\", 18/1/2011 According to Cantonese custom, Pork Knuckles and Ginger Stew is used to celebrate the birth of a child. The new parents will distribute this dish to their relatives and friends to herald the arrival of the newborn twelve days after the baby's birth. Nutrition The ingredients used in making pork knuckles and ginger stew are nutritious which help the new mother to recover. Calcium in the bones of the pork knuckles will be dissolved by the vinegar during the cooking process; a major nutritional value of the dish is to replenish calcium lost during pregnancy. Moreover, not only is ginger rich in Vitamin C, which helps to strengthen the mother's immune system, it also has the function of removing the “wind”,Apple Daily,\\"產後兩周食薑醋 勿加豬腳 (having Ginger Stew two weeks after delivery, but not to add pork knuckles) \\"\\"Apple Daily\\", 27/5/2012 which is known as \\"fung\\" in Cantonese, that is generated during childbirth and when the body is at its weakest; ginger also helps lactation.

Commercialisation  As a traditional ritual, families usually make the stew themselves, sometimes according to their own secret family recipes. In modern times people are less able to spend the time for the time-consuming preparation of the stew. In Hong Kong, Chinese herbal franchises such as Hung Fook Tong and vinegar maker Pat Chun have started selling ready-to-eat Pork Knuckle Stew.

The town is the main headquarters for the Norwegian Coastal Administration as well as the location of the Sunnmøre District Court. In Norwegian, Ålesund is considered to be a which can be translated as a town or a city. Ålesund is the ninth largest town/city in Norway. The town has become more of an urban agglomeration during the late part of the 20th century and the urban area has spread out and into the neighboring municipality. The town has a population (2018) of 52,626 and a population density of . About of the town with a population of 44,070 lies in Ålesund Municipality and the remaining of the town with a population of 8,556 lies in Sula Municipality. The town has an unusually consistent architecture, most of the buildings having been built between 1904 and 1907. Jugendstilsenteret is a national interpretation centre, visitors can learn more about the town fire, the rebuilding of the town and the Art Nouveau style. Ålesund is a partner in the Art nouveau network, a European network of co-operation created in 1999 for the study, safeguards and development of the Art nouveau. The term \\"Little London\\" was often applied to the community during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany due to the Norwegian resistance work that took place here. Among other things, the city was central to the flights to Scotland and England. History Ålesund, Norway, ca. 1895, before the fire Jugendstilsenteret – The Art Nouveau Centre of Norway Legend has it that Gangerolf (outside of Norway better known as Rollo), the 10th-century founder of the dynasty of the dukes of Normandy, hailed from the community of Giske, north-west of the present-day town of Ålesund. At least three statues of Rolle exist: in the town park in Ålesund, in the city of Rouen, France, and in Fargo, North Dakota, United States. The old prestegjeld of Borgund included all of what is now Ålesund. In 1793, the port of Aalesund was granted limited ladested rights. Later, in 1824, it was granted full ladested rights. In 1835, Ålesund had 482 inhabitants.https://www.ssb.no/a/histstat/nos/st_08r_1836-45.pdf On 1 January 1838, the new formannskapsdistrikt law went into effect, granting limited local self-government to all parishes in Norway. Therefore, on that date, the small ladested of Aalesund became a small municipality with its own council. It was surrounded by the large rural municipality of Borgund. In 1848, it was upgraded to the status of a kjøpstad, a more important market town. On 1 January 1875, part of Borgund Municipality (population: 902) was transferred to the town of Ålesund. By 1900, the population had increased to 11,777.https://www.ssb.no/a/histstat/nos/nos_iv_052.pdf In the night of 23 January 1904, the town was the scene of the Ålesund Fire, one of the most terrible of the many conflagrations to which Norwegian towns, once built largely of wood, have been subjected. Practically the entire town was destroyed during the night, a gale aiding the flames, and the population had to leave the town in the middle of the night with only a few minutes' notice. Only one person died in the fire, the 76-year-old Ane Heen, but more than 10,000 people were left without shelter. Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany had often been on vacation to Sunnmøre. After the fire, he sent four warships with materials to build temporary shelters and barracks. After a period of planning, the town was rebuilt in stone, brick, and mortar in Jugendstil (Art Nouveau), the architectural style of the time. The structures were designed by approximately 20 master builders and 30 Norwegian architects, most of them educated in Trondheim and Charlottenburg, Berlin, drawing inspiration from all over Europe. To honor Wilhelm, one of the most frequented streets of the town is named after him. In 1922, another part of Borgund Municipality (population: 1,148) was transferred to the town of Ålesund. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1968, most of the neighbouring municipality of Borgund (population: 20,132) was merged with Ålesund forming the new Ålesund Municipality. This merger more than doubled the population of Ålesund, for a new total population of 38,589 and the land area of the municipality was vastly larger. The town of Ålesund was the administrative centre of the large municipality. After the merger, the town no longer had its own council and was no longer self-governing, with the new municipal council representing the whole municipality. On 1 January 1977, the island of Sula and some small surrounding islets (population: 6,302) were separated from Ålesund to form the new Sula Municipality. The southern part of the town of Ålesund was located on Sula, therefore the town's urban area overlaps two municipalities. Name A part of the town was historically known as Kaupangen Borgund. The Old Norse word kaupang means \\"marketplace\\" or \\"town\\", thus the market town for Borgund. The Old Norse form of the current name was Álasund. The first element of that (probably) is the plural genitive case of áll which means \\"eel\\" and the last element is sund which means \\"strait\\" or \\"sound\\". Before 1921, the name was written Aalesund. Climate Ålesund has a temperate and heavily moderated oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb). Winters are mild, damp and windy; the coldest month of the year, January, has a mean temperature of . The lowest temperature ever recorded at Ålesund Airport, Vigra was . The climate is extremely mild for the latitude and inland areas at similar parallels especially in lowland Sweden see much hotter summers and colder winters. The warmest temperature ever recorded in Ålesund is . The following climate data is from the local Ålesund Airport, Vigra, which is technically not located in the town, but on a nearby island in the sea in Giske Municipality. Ålesund itself is more sheltered and has slightly warmer summers. Transportation MS Polarlys in Ålesund (December 2005) Ålesund is a port of call for passenger and freight vessels travelling between Bergen, Kingston upon Hull, Newcastle, Hamburg, and Trondheim, including the Hurtigruta (Norwegian Coastal Express) cruise ships, which arrive in Ålesund twice a day. The town's airport, Ålesund Airport, Vigra, has several daily flights to/from Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, and Copenhagen. In November 2012 KLM announced it would fly to Ålesund 5 days a week from Amsterdam starting in April 2013. Culture The inner harbour in winter The Norwegian Centre of Art Nouveau Architecture, Jugendstilsenteret, is situated in Ålesund. It is a museum and competence center with exhibitions telling the story of the town fire and Art Nouveu/Jugendstil in Norway and Europe. Sunnmøre museum, founded in 1931, is an outdoor folk museum devoted to the Norwegian coastal culture and way of life. Located on an area of , it has more than 55 old and distinct houses from the past 300 years moved to the site, replicas of old Viking ships, and the Medieval Age Museum with artifacts from excavations of the old trading centre. The local newspaper is Sunnmørsposten, founded in 1882 and published six days a week. Ålesund is the site of the annual Norwegian Food Festival. Education Ålesund is home to a sub-division of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), with approximately 1,800 students and 150 employees. The Ålesund School of Art () is a school for visual arts located in Ålesund. Ålesund videregående skole, also known as Latinskolen, formerly Aalesund Lærd- og Realskole, is the oldest secondary school in Ålesund, having been established in 1863. Of the six upper secondary schools in Ålesund, including Latinskolen, Fagerlia videregående skole is the largest with room for approximately 1,000 students. Ålesund also features an International school for children aged 5–15.

The town is the administrative centre of the municipality. it is located on the islands of Kirkelandet, Innlandet, and Nordlandet in the Nordmøre region of the county. The town has a population (2018) of 18,292 and a population density of . Kristiansund is one of the most densely populated cities of Norway, having what is arguably the country's most urban small city centre, due to the relatively small size of the islands on which it is built and the very constricted central harbour/town area of Kirkelandet. Name The town, formerly spelled Christianssund, was named after the Danish-Norwegian King Christian VI in 1742. The last element of the name, sund, means \\"strait\\". The old name of the town/village (originally the island Kirkelandet) was Fosna or Fosen () which means \\"hiding place\\" (here 'hidden port'). It was also often named Lille Fosen (\\"the small Fosen\\") to distinguish it from the island Storfosna (\\"the big Fosen\\") in Ørland to the north. Before 1877, the name was written Christianssund, from 1877 to 1888 it was spelled Kristianssund, and since 1889 it has had its present spelling, Kristiansund. Before the introduction of postal codes in Norway in 1968, it was easy to confuse the name Kristiansund with Kristiansand in the south. It was therefore obligatory to always add an N (for north) to Kristiansund (Kristiansund N) and an S (for south) to Kristiansand (Kristiansand S). This is pretty much still practiced and also occurs in some other contexts than postal addresses. Coat of arms The coat of arms was granted on 27 June 1742. The arms were granted by King Christian VI and are described as a silver or white river flowing from a cliff, with salmon jumping upwards on a blue background. The waterfall may possibly be the Lille Fosen waterfall near the town. There are two myths as to why the arms show a waterfall. The first one is because the old name of the town (Fosen) was misinterpreted as Fossund (as a compound of foss which means waterfall and sund which means strait). The other myth concerning the coat of arms is that there was a mix up, between Kristiansund's and Molde's intended shield. The Dano-Norwegian government officials in charge of the giving of the coats, had a party to remember the momentous occasion and became too drunk and hungover to remember which was which, and so Molde got the coat with a whale (which are scarce in between the Romsdal fjords) and Kristiansund got the waterfall (since Molde is on the mainland and Kristiansund lies in the open sea, it would be more likely that the waterfall was intended for Molde's mountains and the whales for Kristiansund.) History 8000 BC–1066 Many scientists believe that the very first Norwegians lived near the area of the present-day town of Kristiansund. At the end of the last Ice age some areas at the western coast of Norway were ice-free. There was also a lot of food in the sea around Kristiansund at that time, and it is believed that the first settlement arrived in Kristiansund around year 8000 BC. During the Viking ages there were many important battles around Kristiansund. The most famous one was the Battle of Rastarkalv on the island of Frei, where the Norwegian King Håkon the Good fought against the Eirikssønnene group. There is now a memorial monument located near Rastakalv (at Nedre Frei), where the battle was fought. Middle ages A picture of Christianssund from the early 1840s. The nearby island of Grip was an important fishing community during the Middle Ages, and was considered to be the most important area in the region at the time. The natural harbour in Lille-Fosen, close to where Kristiansund is located today, was also frequently used for fishing purposes. 17th to 18th century During the 17th century a small settlement developed around the area we know today as Kristiansund harbour. As more and more settlers arrived, the area became an important trading port for fishing and the lumber transportation along the coast. The Dano-Norwegian government established a customs station here, which was controlled by the main trading port in Trondheim. In 1631, the port was declared to be a ladested. Dutch sailors brought the knowledge of clipfish production to Kristiansund at the end of the 17th century, and for a number of years the town was the largest exporter of clipfish in Norway, exporting goods mainly to the Mediterranean countries as Spain and Portugal. The city's clipfish production was also part of the reason why it was given town status as a kjøpstad in 1742. 19th century to present The town of Christianssund was established as Christianssund Municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Kristiansund Municipality was merged with the tiny Grip Municipality (population: 104) to the northwest and the Dale area of Bremsnes Municipality on Nordlandet island (population: 963). The neighboring Frei Municipality was merged with Kristiansund on 1 January 2008 creating a much larger Kristiansund Municipality. Media There are two local TV stations in Kristiansund. The larger one is TVNordvest, (TV North- West) which broadcasts local news from the area around Kristiansund on a daily basis, as well as some other TV shows. The second one is TV Kristiansund, which is more of a culture channel, broadcasting cultural news from Kristiansund, like shows from the city Opera. The local newspaper of Kristiansund is Tidens Krav, which also functions as a local newspaper for the other municipalities located nearby the city. Climate Kristiansund has a maritime, temperate climate with cool-to-warm summers and relatively short and mild winters. The landscape with its unique natural harbour combined with warm wind from the southwest of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream gives Kristiansund a much warmer climate than its latitude would indicate. Parks and gardens A small section of the Langveien-park. Though fairly small in size, the town of Kristiansund contains many green parks and gardens, frequently used by the local inhabitants. There are two larger parks near the city centre. The first one is located near Langveien, and was constructed in the aftermath of World War II . The second one is located in Vanndamman. This area used to be part of the city water supply, due to the large amount of small lakes in the area. (hence the name \\"Vanndamman\\" (The Water ponds)) The two parks are partly linked together, but the Langveien park serves more as an urban recreation area due to the short walking distance from the city centre, while the Vanndamman park is more suitable for outings and jogging. Transport Started in 1876 and still going strong is the Sundbåt (\\"Sound Boat\\"/\\"Strait Crossing Boat\\") shuttle service with a capacity of a few tens of passengers, traveling between the islands that make up the town. The small motor ferry crosses the harbour from Kirkelandet to Innlandet, then goes on to Nordlandet, to Gomalandet, and back to Kirkelandet, repeating the round trip in half-hour intervals morning to evening on weekdays. The Sundbåt bears the distinction of being the world's oldest motorized regular public transport system in continuous service. The road to Kristiansund from the mainland, Norwegian National Road 70 (Rv70) is connected to European route E39 by the bridge/tunnel system called Krifast. After passing through the underwater Freifjord Tunnel from the central part of Krifast, National Road 70 crosses Frei, and enters Kristiansund over the Omsund Bridge onto Nordlandet. The Nordsund Bridge brings the Rv70 to Gomalandet and its terminus in downtown at Kirkelandet. Another high bridge, the Sørsund Bridge, leads from Kirkelandet to Innlandet. E39 leads southwest to the town of Molde and northeast via the European route E6 to Trøndelag and the city of Trondheim. There used to be a car ferry going from Kirkelandet island to neighboring Averøy Municipality to the west, whose people have been commuting to town for many years for work as well as selling agricultural products. The ferry to Averøy connected Kristiansund to Norwegian National Road 64, which continued along the scenic Atlantic Ocean Road to Molde. The ferry was replaced by the long underwater Atlantic Ocean Tunnel in December 2009. Because both tunnels are forbidden for bicyclists, Kristiansund cannot easily be reached by bicycle. A second car ferry goes from Seivika on Nordlandet to the nearby island of Tustna in the northeast as part of County Road 680, with further road and ferry connections to the islands of Smøla and Hitra, and to Aure Municipality on the mainland. Besides roads and car ferries and Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, connections to/from Kristiansund consist of the traditional coastal express Hurtigruten boats which connect the coastal towns from Bergen in the south to Kirkenes in the north, as well as the high speed catamaran passenger service Kystekspressen to Trondheim. Another option to get to Kristiansund is to fly with Scandinavian Airlines from several other Norwegian cities. Commerce and industry The front façade of Kirkelandet Church. It was one of the first truly modern church buildings in Norway, constructed in the mid-1960s. Kristiansund is known as the major bacalhau city of Norway. Bacalhau is made of salted, dried codfish,Salted, dried cod, used in bacalao (see Baccalà and Bacalhau), is known locally as klippfisk (\\"Cliff Fish\\", eng. clipfish), the name coming from the rounded, barren cliffs on which the fish were traditionally left to dry in the open air after being opened, gutted, flattened, salted, and pressed. and has traditionally been exported in large amounts to Spain, Portugal, and Latin America as food suitable during Lent. In recent years Kristiansund has become the major oil and gas city at the mid- northwestern coast. Oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil have offices in Kristiansund from where they serve their offshore installations at Haltenbanken (one of the northernmost underwater oil fields in the world). Due to the city's heavy involvement in fish processing and international shipping, there used to be as many as seven consulates in Kristiansund, mainly to Latin countries. Currently, there are only five left: Britain, Finland, Latvia, the Netherlands, and Portugal.

History  Formation  On July 8, Aries defeated Bobby Roode in the main event of Destination X to become the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. On July 17, TNA president Dixie Carter announced that Aries had signed a new long-term deal with the promotion. Aries and Roode had a non-title rematch on the July 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, which ended in a no contest, when both competitors were attacked by a group of masked assailants, known only as the \\"Aces & Eights\\". On August 12 at Hardcore Justice, Aries successfully defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Roode, with a pre-match stipulation preventing Roode from getting another rematch for the title as long as Aries was champion. During the following weeks, Aries moved from Roode to defending TNA against the Aces & Eights. On the December 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, Aries was revealed as the man who paid the Aces & Eights to prevent Bobby Roode, who originally paid the group to help him win the World Heavyweight Championship, from winning at the pay-per-view, which led Jeff Hardy to issue him a title challenge. On the December 20 episode of Impact Wrestling, Aries was unsuccessful in his challenge for Hardy's World Heavyweight Championship, following interference from Bobby Roode. Aries and Roode faced off in a number one contenders match on the December 27 episode of Impact Wrestling. The match ended in a no contest after the two attacked referee Earl Hebner and then were, in turn attacked by Hardy. The rivalry culminated in a three-way elimination match on January 13, 2013, at Genesis, where Aries failed again to regain the World Heavyweight Championship from Hardy.  TNA World Tag Team Champions (2013) On January 25, at the tapings of the February 7 episode of Impact Wrestling in Manchester, England, Roode and Aries defeated Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Hernandez to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship, thus giving Aries the TNA Triple Crown. Roode and Aries made their first successful title defense on March 10 at Lockdown, defeating Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian) and Chavo Guerrero, Jr. and Hernandez in a three-way match. On the March 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Aries and Roode defeated Guerrero and Hernandez to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship, following interference from Daniels and Kazarian. Afterwards, the champions would be attacked by Daniels and Kazarian On the April 11 episode of Impact Wrestling, Roode and Aries lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship back to Guerrero and Hernandez in a Two-out-of-Three Falls match, ending their reign at 76 days. Aries and Roode received their rematch on the April 25 episode of Impact Wrestling, but were again defeated by Guerrero and Hernandez after an inadvertent interference from Christopher Daniels and Kazarian. Aries and Roode faced Daniels and Kazarian in number one contenders match on the May 9 episode of Impact Wrestling, however, the match ended in a no contest after special guest referee James Storm superkicked Aries and Daniels and walked out on the match. Aries and Roode received another shot at Guerrero and Hernandez's titles on June 2 at Slammiversary XI, in an fatal four-way elimination match, which was won by Gunner and James Storm. Roode turned on Aries to form EGO with Daniels and Kazarian.  Reunion (2015) In May 2015, Roode and Aries reunited as faces in pursuit of the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship, they both agreed to a best of five series with The Wolves. On June 3, 2015 in the third match of the series, with The Wolves up 2-0, Aries pressured Roode to hit Eddie Edwards with a steel chair. As Roode refused, Aries distracted the referee and Roode hit Edwards with a low blow and hit him with a steel chair to win the match, turning heel in the process. They lost the Best of 5 series to The Wolves for the tag titles in the fifth match. On the July 29, 2015 episode of Impact Wrestling, Aries agreed to face Rockstar Spud, with Aries's career and Spud's \\"Rockstar\\" moniker on the line, stating if he couldn't beat Spud he didn't deserve to be there. On the August 5, 2015 episode of Impact Wrestling, Aries ultimately lost the match, and as a result had to leave TNA. After the match, Aries raised Spud's hand, and the two embraced. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Aries' loss angered Roode, who proceeded to assault Spud. On November 14, 2015, The Dirty Heels reunited at House of Hardcore 11 where they lost to The Wolves in the main event for the TNA World Tag Team Championship.

He played one season of college basketball for the Florida Gators during the 2014–15 season. Before Florida, he played four years with the Michigan Wolverines ending with the 2013–14 team. He was an All-State high school basketball player for Grand Ledge High School in Michigan. His father, Tito Horford, and brother, Al Horford, have both played in the National Basketball Association. Early years Horford is the son of Elizabeth and Tito Horford. His father was the first player born in the Dominican Republic to play in the NBA. His older brother, Al, led the Florida Gators to NCAA basketball championships in 2006 and 2007, and was the third overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft. Horford attended the 2007 NCAA Tournament at the Georgia Dome to watch his brother. Horford played high school basketball at Grand Ledge High School in Grand Ledge, Michigan where he was selected as a first- team Class A All-State player in 2010 by the Associated Press, The Detroit News, and the Detroit Free Press. His younger brother Josh Horford is a senior on the Grand Ledge High School basketball team. College career Michigan Horford blocks a shot in 2012 In March 2010, Horford verbally committed to play college basketball at the University of Michigan, choosing Michigan over California and Providence. He signed a letter of intent two weeks later at the opening of the spring signing period on April 14. As a freshman, Horford appeared in 29 games for the 2010–11 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team. He totaled 11 blocked shots, good for second place on the Michigan team behind Jordan Morgan. He also totaled 58 rebounds as he helped the team to a 21-14 record. As a sophomore, Horford gained 30 pounds (from 220 to 250 pounds), raising expectations that he would become a more dominant player. Early in the season, he appeared in nine games for the 2011–12 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team. He scored a career-high 12 points, all in the first half, against UCLA at the Maui Invitational Tournament on November 23, 2011. In early December, he sustained a stress fracture to his right foot that resulted in his missing the final 25 games of the season. Horford was granted a medical redshirt due to the injury. As a redshirt sophomore, Horford appeared in 28 games and averaged 9.2 minutes per game for the 2012–13 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team. He missed five games after sustaining a knee injury in a December 15 game against West Virginia. Horford blocked three shots on two separate occasions, against Arkansas on December 8, 2012, and against Northwestern on January 30, 2013. In mid-March, he scored a season-high 11 points in Michigan's 83-66 victory over Penn State in the Big Ten tournament. He totaled 16 blocks for the season, ranking fourth on the team behind Mitch McGary (24), Trey Burke (18), and Tim Hardaway, Jr. (17). As Michigan advanced to the 2013 Final Four at the Georgia Dome, Horford drew attention for his interest in reading ancient Chinese texts. In the locker room after Michigan's overtime victory over Kansas, Horford was in a corner of the locker room reading \\"Tao Te Ching\\", a Chinese text written around the 6th century BC. Horford's older brother, Al, who had played for Florida's back-to-back national championship teams, expressed pride: \\"It's just exciting. He was here watching me a few years ago going through the Final Four in Atlanta and now here's here, so we're super excited.\\" The 2013 final four was at the same Georgia Dome that Al had won the championship at in 2007. Michigan reached the championship game. On November 8, 2013, Horford posted a career high 12 rebounds against the UMass Lowell in the season opener. In the subsequent game against South Carolina State on November 12, Horford again established a career high of 15 rebounds and added 9 points leaving him a point shy of a double-double. Prior to the game, the last time a Michigan Wolverine had posted 15 or more rebounds was when Manny Harris posted 16 on December 29, 2008 against North Carolina Central. In the January 2 Big Ten Conference opener against Minnesota at the Williams Arena, Horford established a new career high with 14 points and added 9 rebounds. On March 4, Horford had 10 rebounds against Illinois to help Michigan clinch its 14th and 8th outright Big Ten Conference championship. The 2013–14 team advanced to the elite eight round of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament before being eliminated by Kentucky. Horford announced on April 10 that he would use his 5th year of redshirt eligibility by transferring to a graduate program at another school. Because he graduated in April, he was eligible to immediately join another team for the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. On April 26, Horford announced he was transferring to play for the Florida Gators men's basketball team. Florida Horford playing for Florida Horford opened the season in the starting lineup for the 2014–15 Florida Gators on November 14 against William & Mary.

The Mutual Protection of Southeast China () was an agreement made in the summer of 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion by governors of the provinces in southern, eastern and central China when the Eight Power Expedition invaded North China. The governors, including Li Hongzhang (governor-general of Guangdong, Guangxi), Xu Yingkui (governor-general of Fujian, Zhejiang), Liu Kunyi (governor-general of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi), Zhang Zhidong (governor-general of Hubei, Hunan) and Yuan Shikai (provincial governor of Shandong), refused to carry out the imperial decree promulgated by the Qing dynasty to declare war on 11 foreign nations, with the aim of preserving peace in their own provinces. Some other Han provincial authorities, such as the governor-general of Sichuan and the provincial governor of Shaanxi, did not formally join the mutual protection agreement but similarly disobeyed the imperial edict. Thus, for the first time, the vast majority of Han regional authorities refused to aid the Qing court. For much of the conflict, the main forces fighting for the Qing court (alongside the Boxers) were the Manchu Hushenying, the Manchu Peking Field Force and three of five divisions of the Qing court's most modernized Wuwei Corps (including its Manchu division and Muslim Gansu division), but Yuan Shikai commanded the other two divisions into Shandong and actively used them to suppress the Boxers, in open defiance of the Qing court. In Manchuria, large groups of Chinese bandits named Honghuzi (\\"Red Beards\\") also actively fought alongside with Manchu banners, mostly as a response to the separate Russian invasion that had widespread atrocities. Background In 1895, China had lost the war against Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War. China had not recovered by 1900. It is obvious to most that China was in no position to fight against any single foreign nation, let alone against multiple foreign nations at once. Course Even before the declaration of war by the Qing court in 1900, governors of the provinces in Eastern and Southern China had discussed ways to preserve peace in their territories, primarily against an invasion by foreign powers. Among them were Liu Kunyi (Viceroy of Liangjiang), Zhang Zhidong (Viceroy of Huguang) and Li Hongzhang (Viceroy of Liangguang). The governors had also concluded that if Peking were to fall and the status of the Emperor and the Empress Dowager were unknown, a presidential republic would be declared, and Li Hongzhang would be the first President of China. On 21 June 1900, the Empress Dowager issued the Imperial Decree of declaration of war against foreign powers on behalf of the Emperor, against 11 countries simultaneously: Russian Empire, United States, United Kingdom, Japan, France, German Empire, Italy, Spain, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The Minister for Telegraphy, Sheng Xuanhuai, managed to stop the Imperial Decree and another decree to gather the Boxers from going public. Instead, the decrees were shown only to the governors, together with a telegram instructing them not to follow the imperial order. Li Hongzhang, Yuan Shikai and other viceroys openly rejected the Dowager's call to stage military actions against the foreign powers. Li Hongzhang, in particular, issued a telegram: 'This is a false decree. The Provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi will not obey'.庚子國變記，作者：羅惇曧。 Zhang Zhidong tabled again the proposal to establish a Chinese Republic with Li Hongzhang as the President in the event that the Imperial Court fell, along with Peking.絕版李鴻章，作者：張社生，文匯出版社，。 The governors asked the foreign powers not to invade their provinces no matter what happened to the North (i.e. Peking, Hebei and Shanxi) ; and conveyed this order to their subordinates: \\"Belligerent mobs should not be used; heresy and mysticism should not be trusted; armed conflicts should not be initiated.\\" Li Hongzhang used the Siege of the International Legations as a political weapon against his rivals in Beijing since he controlled the Chinese telegraph service. He exaggerated and lied, claiming that Chinese forces committed atrocities and murder upon the foreigners and exterminated all of them. The information was sent to the Western world. He aimed to infuriate the Europeans against the Chinese forces in Beijing and succeeded in spreading massive amounts of false information to the West. The false information spread by Li played a part in the massive atrocities that the foreigners later committed upon the Chinese in Beijing. p. 146 For refusing to obey the Chinese government's orders and not sending his own troops to help the Chinese army at all during the Boxer Rebellion, Li Hongzhang was praised by Westerners. Yuan Shikai and Zhang Zhidong ignored Empress Dowager Cixi's declaration of war against the foreign powers and continued to suppress the Boxers. In addition to not fighting the Eight-Nation Alliance and to suppressing the Boxers in Shandong, Yuan and his army (the Right Division) also helped the Eight-Nation Alliance suppress the Boxers after the Alliance captured Beijing in August 1900. Yuan Shikai's forces massacred tens of thousands of people in their anti-Boxer campaign in Zhili Province. Yuan operated out of Baoding during the campaign, which ended in 1902. Significance This event marked the first time that Han officials openly refused to obey orders from the Manchu court (Li Hongzhang, Liu Kunyi, Zhang Zhidong were all Han Chinese). From the perspective of the provinces, the event successfully prevented war and turmoil from affecting their territories. After the Eight Power Expedition, the local authorities saw the need to enhance local military strength to defend themselves against foreign invasions. When the Qing court collapsed and imperial officials were expelled upon the Xinhai revolution, the militarily-powerful regional authorities led to the Warlord Era. From the perspective of the Qing court, the Eight Power Expedition, together with the series of military confrontations made with foreign powers, hurt national pride. In particular, the event showed how prominent regionalism had become since local authorities refused to abide by the imperial order. These led to the fear of dismemberment of the state. Hence, the government made attempts to recentralise power and win back support. For example, it proposed to prepare for a constitution, a royal cabinet, together with a series of reforms. However, those actions were mainly seen as insincere as their chief intent was to prolong the Manchu rule, instead of strengthening China and sharing power with other ethnicities. The reforms did little to save the Qing court, and imperial rule collapsed in 1911 after the Chinese Revolution. In the ending days of the dynasty, the Qing court made a final attempt to re-appoint Yuan Shikai, who was politically exiled in 1908-1911 for participating role in the mutual protection agreement. Yuan Shikai eventually agreed to take control of the modernized imperial Beiyang Army and made a few successful expeditions against the revolutionaries; however, he almost immediately entered negotiations with the revolutionaries and eventually forced the abdication of the Qing court.

His birthplace was most likely Achicourt, just south of Arras.According to Karp, some nine towns are candidates to be the \\"Angicourt\\" of his birth. His surviving oeuvre is large by the standards of the trouvères, and well-distributed in the chansonniers: thirty-five (35) of his songs survive, in some case in as many as eleven different manuscripts. Two, or perhaps three, of Perrin's songs—\\"J'ai un joli souvenir\\", \\"Quant partis sui\\" and perhaps \\"Quant li cincenis s'escrie\\"—are described in their chansonniers as \\"crowned songs\\" (chansons couronnées), indicating that they had won poetry competitions, probably under the aegis of the puy d'Arras. Twice Perrin composed jeux partis—\\"Perrin d'Angicourt, respondés\\" and \\"Prince del pui\\"—with Jehan Bretel, also from Arras, and he is referenced in other jeux partis by Bretel, Gaidifer d'Avion, Lambert Ferri, Jehan de Grieviler and a certain Audefroi (perhaps the banker Audefroi Louchart), and also a song by Gillebert de Berneville. Perrin dedicated his own songs \\"Quant voi en la fin\\" and \\"Lors quant je voi\\" to Duke Henry III of Brabant and Count Guy of Flanders, respectively, known patrons of the trouvères of Arras. Perrin's most important patron, however, was Count Charles of Anjou, younger brother of King Louis IX of France and later himself King of Naples.According to Karp, Charles \\"is known as the patron of Adam de la Halle and Rutebeuf.\\" Perrin dedicated \\"Quant li biaus estés repaire\\" to Charles, he and the count partnered to compose the jeu parti \\"Quens d'Anjou\\" and the two together judged \\"Encor sui cil qui a merci s'atent\\" by Jehan Erart. Charles also judged one of Perrin's jeux partis with Bretel, \\"Perrin d'Angicourt, respondés\\". Although the Charles and Perrin's literary relationship is known, evidence of their real-world interactions is scarce. One document of 1269 may refer to Perrin when it names Petrus de Angicuria as a \\"rector of the chapel\\" (rector capellae) to Charles in Naples. Most of Perrin's poems are strophic, that is, they contain stanzas each with lines of different length. \\"Quant partis sui\\" has five line lengths per strophe. His preference was for heptasyllables. Twelve of his poems have fixed or varying refrains. Five or six of were used as models for contrafacta. Two, possibly three, have their melodies preserved in mensural notation. Notes Sources *Theodore Karp. \\"Perrin d'Angicourt\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online.

Though the demand for a separate state existed as far back as 1913 (and possibly earlier), it gained momentum in the 1940s and 1950s. There were continuous demonstrations, strikes, etc. Telugu leaders like Tanguturi Prakasam, Tenneti Viswanatham, Bulusu Sambamurti, Bezawada Gopala Reddy, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, Veeresalingam Pantulu and Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya led the agitation. The efforts were unsuccessful. They popularized the slogan 'Madrasu Manade'(మద్రాసు మనదే, Madras is ours). Tamils opposed the inclusion of Madras. J.V.P. Committee The J.V.P. Committee took its name from its members Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya. The Committee reported to the Working Committee of the Indian National Congress in April, 1949, recommending that the creation of linguistic provinces be postponed. However, it suggested that Andhra Province could be formed, provided the Andhras gave up their claim to the city of Madras. This report provoked violent reaction in Andhra as the Telugus were not prepared to forgo their claims. The two alternative political solutions suggested by Andhra leaders were to make Madras as joint capital of Andhra and Madras States or to divide the City, allowing the areas north of the river Cooum going to Andhra and areas south of the river going to Madras states did not find favour with Tamils or central leaders.

He served in North America between 1757 and 1760 and is notable for providing historians with the most complete account of these campaigns. Knox narrowly avoided being killed in 1759 when a French soldier's musket twice misfired, and he went on to fight in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, where he performed in one of the most devastating volleys in military history. Knox also took part in the Battle of Sainte Foy and was present when Montreal surrendered on the 8 September 1760. Early life Very little is known about his early life. He was born in Ireland, the third son of a Sligo merchant, and served as a volunteer in the British Army before distinguishing himself at the Battle of Lauffeld in 1747. Consequently, he was awarded an ensigncy in the 43rd Regiment of Foot by the Duke of Cumberland.Snow (p.22) North America In 1754 Knox, still with the 43rd, purchased a lieutenancy and three years later left Ireland with his regiment for Halifax, Nova Scotia. The 43rd were initially intended to support the Earl of Loudon's operation against Louisbourg but this expedition never took place as a result of a combination of poor weather conditions and a strong French naval contingent. Nor did Knox's regiment take part in Amherst's successful campaign the following year. Instead, they spent those two years stationed at Fort Cumberland and around Annapolis.Snow (p.23) Knox noted in his diary that, \\"Though we are said to be in possession of Nova Scotia, yet it is in reality of a few fortresses only, the French and the Indians disputing the country with us on every occasion, inch by inch, even within range of our artillery; so that, as I have observed before, when the troops are not numerous, they cannot venture in safety beyond their walls\\". Quebec In the spring of 1759, the 43rd were sent to join General Wolfe's troops for the assault on Quebec. Serving under James Murray, Knox was present at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. While surveying the Montmorency Falls on 24 August Knox's journal records how he narrowly avoided being shot when a French soldier's musket misfired.Knox (Vol. 2) (pp.30-31) By September Wolfe was desperate to bring the siege to a conclusion. He called a meeting of his brigadiers and an amphibious assault on the Anse du Foulon was decided upon. Here a narrow pathway provided access to the Plains of Abraham. The landing took place on the night of the 12th-13th. A French-speaking officer named Donald MacDonald fooled the sentry guarding the track, and by morning ten battalions of British troops had formed up on the Plains of Abraham.Holmes (p.17) Knox's regiment was at the centre with the 47th, with orders not to fire until the enemy were within 40 paces. Knox noted how the French released their first full volley at some 136 yards but the enemy's fire was met with \\"...the greatest intrepidity and firmness\\".Snow (p.368) When the British finally returned fire, Knox describes how they did so with \\"great calmness\\" and how the resulting discharge was as close and heavy as any performed.Snow (p.369) This short-range volley was one of the most destructive in military history. A second volley was fired and then the British army charged. The French were routed and the city surrendered five days later. Sainte Foy, 2nd Quebec and Montreal The Duc de Levis, intent on expelling the British, returned to Quebec the following spring with an army of 7,000 men. James Murray felt his depleted force of 4,000 would be unable to hold the city, the defences of which had not been improved over the winter.Snow (pp.414-415) With insufficient time to entrench, Murray, like Montcalm, decided to go on the offensive and on 28 April 1760 he marched his troops out of the city to do battle with a superior French force. Knox describes how, in order to appear more numerous, certain portions of the British army were drawn up two deep.Knox (Vol.2) (p.293) Murray thought his best chance was to attack the French before they had time to form up; this tactic proved successful at first, due in part to the more numerous British artillery. When the British were required to advance, however, they had to do so without their guns, which had become stuck in the mud and snow. Knox's diary describes how his regiment, the 43rd, together with the 3rd battalion of Americans captured and briefly held two redoubts before being pushed back. Eventually, the British were forced to retreat to the city, which, despite heavy losses, they were able to hold until reinforcements arrived in May. Levis was then obliged to retire to Montreal. Knox then took part in the subsequent Montreal Campaign where in September Levis would be compelled to surrender to a much larger British force.Snow (pp.417-418) Later career By the end of 1760, Knox was a captain in an independent company in England. This company briefly formed part of the 99th Foot regiment, before it was disbanded following the Treaty of Paris (1763). It was around this time that Knox, now residing in Gloucester on half-pay, wrote his two-volume book An Historical Journal of the Campaigns in North America for the Years 1757, 1758, 1759 and 1760, published in London in 1769. The work, a composite of Knox's own diary, official documents and operational orders, is today considered one of the most important and complete account of these campaigns.Snow (p.22) This work was edited by Arthur Doughty and republished in three parts in 1914 as part of the General Series of the Champlain Society. Personal life Knox married a well-to-do Irish lady, Jane Carre, in 1751. Her estate, however, was managed by a trustee and Knox never fully benefited from her wealth. Knox and his wife had a son, whom they both outlived. References Bibliography * *Knox, John. Historical Journal of the Campaigns in North America for the Years 1757, 1758, 1759 and 1760 Vol. 1.

The crossing, at the meeting point of Quebec Route 147 and Vermont Route 147, is the only crossing between the two communities. The US border station, built in 1933, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Both stations are open 24 hours a day. Setting The Norton–Stanhope Border Crossing is located in a rural area of northeastern Vermont and southern Estrie. The small Vermont village of Norton lies adjacent to the border, while the immediate border area on the Quebec side is rural, with only the Canadian border stations and farmland nearby. Route 147 runs northwest-southeast, paralleling the Coaticook River, which flows to its west. A railroad line runs north-south across the border between the road and the river, crossing the river in Quebec en route to Sherbrooke. Canadian station The Canadian station is located a short way north of the border, on the east side of the road. Across the street is a small duty-free shop. Canada constructed this border station in 1954. Prior to that time, the Canadian border station at this crossing was a two-story gambrel structure. Canada's Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office designated the current facility as a Recognized Federal Heritage Building in 1991. United States station The US border station at Norton VT The United States station is located on the northwest side of Route 147, on a triangular parcel bounded by the border, the road, and the railroad tracks. It is a 1-1/2 story Colonial Revival brick building, with single-story garage wings extending from both sides. A port-cochere extends across two lanes, providing shelter for arriving vehicles as they are processed. The front facade of the building is five bays wide, and basically symmetrical, with two sash windows on either side of the entrance. The entrance is itself asymmetrical, with a sidelight window on the left side and a transom window above. This is topped by a round-arch brick pattern set in the wall, with a projecting marble keystone. The wings are wood-framed and clad in vinyl siding; that on the left was originally used for customs inspections, but has been converted entirely into office space. Behind the main building is a World War II-era concrete block truck inspection facility. The station was built in 1933 as part of a major program to improve the nation's border security, brought on by more widespread use of the automobile for travel, smuggling that had increased by Prohibition, and illegal immigration. The conversion of the customs bays to offices was an early alteration, and the port-cochere is a stylistically sympathetic replacement, built to meet requirements for handling higher-clearance vehicles than the original. The stations is one of ten period border stations in the state of Vermont to survive, the most of any state. Former second crossing US-Canada border on Nelson Road prior to being barricadedThe towns were originally joined by two roads. Rue Principale in Quebec became Nelson Road in the United States, which winds its way just south of the US station. In 2015 this crossing was blocked with bollards. There once was a general store on the boundary on Rue Principale, which also served liquor during Prohibition in the United States. It featured two cash registers, one on either side of the boundary to serve the customers of each respective country.O'Neill, Thomas and Yamashita, Michael (Photographer) (1984).

At the , it had a population of 1,241. The village, along with its southern neighbours Mollymook and Mollymook Beach are generally considered part of the Milton-Ulladulla district within the City of Shoalhaven local government area. Narrawallee is predominantly a residential suburb, bordered by a tidal inlet to the north and Matron Porter Drive. The name \\"Narrawallee\\" is taken from the creek which flows eastwards from Milton and its estuary on the Tasman Sea and is itself a corruption of the Aboriginal words Nurrawerree or Narra Warra. History The first inhabitants and traditional landowners of the area were the Budawang indigenous people. European activity in Narrawallee began in 1924 when a gauge tramway was constructed to transport silica from deposits near Conjola to a jetty at Bannister Head. This involved the construction of a bridge across the mouth of Narrawallee inlet using local timbers at a cost of £2600. Silica transported on the tramway was crushed at a facility at Bannister Head, then shipped to steelworks at Newcastle and Port Kembla. The tramline survived until due to a downturn in production during World War II the rails were lifted in 1943 and the bridge dismantled the following year. Remnants of the bridge supports are still visible on the northern side of Narrawallee inlet. Narrawallee beach viewed from Bannister Headland Present day Popular due to its coastal setting, development in the modern village of Narrawallee began in the 1960s and 70s and is made up of a mix of permanent residences, holiday rentals and weekenders. Residential development is set back from Narrawallee Beach, providing a public foreshore reserve. During summer holiday periods, lifeguards from the Mollymook Surf Lifesaving Club patrol the southern end of the beach. A boat ramp at Narrawallee Inlet allows small vessels to be launched depending on tides and public restrooms, picnic and barbecue areas are also provided. The reserve provides opportunities for activities such as bush walking and fishing, as well as recreational water sports and is popular with families as the estuary is protected from the rough surf. The village is served six days a week by local bus services to both Milton and Ulladulla by Ulladulla Bus Lines route 740. The Milton-Ulladulla Baptist Church is located in Narrawallee.

With him is multi-award winning reporter Hana Kim-Kennedy. A classmate of his in the FBI Citizens Academy Frank Murphy is known as a radio and televisions personality in Knoxville, Tennessee. He was formerly a producer for high-profile morning shows in Washington, DC and Los Angeles, CA. Frank is a member of Knoxville's long-running improvisational theatre company, Einstein Simplified and host of Scholars' Bowl on East Tennessee PBS. Murphy was the 2014 Knoxville recipient of the FBI Director's Community Leadership Award. In 2014, he was the Social Media inductee in the Friends of Literacy East Tennessee Writers Hall of Fame. Frank was named Best Local Blogger in the 2012 Metro Pulse readers survey. He was also voted East Tennessee's Best Local Blogger in 2008 and was voted first runner up in 2007, 2009 and 2010 by readers of the Knoxville News Sentinel. Radio experience - producer Early career Murphy began his radio career in 1982 at the campus radio station of George Mason University, WGMU. That summer he worked the midday shift at WVBK-AM in Herndon, Virginia, without being paid. At the start of 1983, he was named station manager of WGMU, just as it was transitioning from a closed circuit broadcast available only in the Rathskeller to a carrier current transmission which could be heard in the dorms and student apartments on any AM radio. A WGMU air band contest caught the attention of Denise Benoit, the promotion director of WAVA-FM. She contacted Murphy and hired him as her intern for the summer of 1984. At the end of his internship, Murphy was hired by the station as its assistant promotion director, a position he held until 1986. During 1985 Murphy was heard on the air reading snow closing announcements in the morning or doing an occasional weekend air shift. He was most often heard as part of Don Geronimo's afternoon drive program, especially when the show would broadcast from local bars on Friday afternoons. The Don and Mike Show, WAVA In November 1986, Murphy replaced John Nolan as morning show producer for the Don and Mike Show. In this position, he regularly made appearances on the show, often when something went wrong and hosts Don and Mike were heard to yell out \\"Fraaaank\\". Frequent guest Bobcat Goldthwait would jokingly refer to him as \\"the omnipresent Frank.\\" He continued in that job until Don & Mike left WAVA in 1991 upon the announcement of the station's sale to Salem Communications. Murphy served as morning host until the sale became final. During that time, Murphy won the Best New Talent in the Market award at the March of Dimes Achievement In Radio Awards. When the sale's closing was delayed, Murphy partnered with afternoon host Joe Friday and traffic reporter Janet from Another Planet to create a new morning show for the station's last few months. WAVA changed format on February 12, 1992. The Jay Thomas Show, KPWR Five days after WAVA changed formats, Murphy began a new job as morning show producer for Jay Thomas at KPWR (Power 106) in Los Angeles. While there, Murphy appeared as an extra in the movie \\"It's Pat\\" and as a featured extra in episode 17 (\\"Two on the Aisle\\") of the first season of Jay Thomas' sitcom, \\"Love & War.\\" Thomas left the radio station in 1993. The Kevin & Bean Show, KROQ A few months later Murphy departed KPWR for a job as morning show producer for Kevin and Bean at KROQ. He worked alongside Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla and often participated in on air segments. Kevin & Bean once challenged Murphy to sell over 1,000 boxes of Girl Scout Cookies for his daughter. Underground singer-songwriter Wesley Willis visited KROQ several times. He wrote and performed on-air a song titled \\"Frank Murphy.\\" The lyrics included the lines: \\"You are a working-class dog. You are a producer for the Kevin & Bean Show. You work hard at 106.7 KROQ. You are a working-class man.\\"http://www.frankmurphy.com/2009/12/like-you-fairly-well.html The Mark & Brian Show, KLOS In 1996, Murphy was hired as executive producer of the syndicated Mark and Brian show based at KLOS. Mark & Brian would refer to him as \\"Mr. Owl\\" due to his love of trivial information. He participated in the annual \\"Football Bet,\\" always choosing to support the Washington Redskins. His unusual punishments included cleaning a public restroom, collecting semen from a bull and picking the nose of a stranger. He was also known for writing the difficult trivia questions for the \\"You Can't Win\\" game. Radio experience - on air Morning Show, KLYY In February 1999, Murphy reported for jury duty at the L.A. County Criminal Courts Building. During his two weeks of service, he was accepted a job as co-host of the morning show on KLYY (Y-107). By the end of the year, the station had switched to a Spanish language format and all the on air personalities had been fired. FM in the AM, Comedy World Radio Network Murphy was unemployed until being contacted in early 2000 by radio host Brian Whitman about a new Internet company called Comedy World. Murphy joined the new company as both producer of a talk show co-hosted by comedian Allan Havey and actress Susan Olsen and as host of his own weekend talk show called FM in the AM. By 2001, the company had become known as the Comedy World Radio Network and had added terrestrial radio affiliates in Syracuse, Atlantic City, Spokane, Reno and Savannah/Charleston. In April of that year the company filed bankruptcy, leaving Murphy and his co-workers unemployed. Phil & Murphy in the Morning, WOKI Murphy did a number of odd jobs around Hollywood until being hired as co-host of a morning show in Knoxville, Tennessee. In April 2002, the Phil & Murphy in the Morning show debuted on 100.3 The River (WOKI). Murphy worked with longtime Knoxville personalities Phil Williams and newsman David Henley. In July 2003, the entire staff was dismissed when ownership of The River transferred from Dick Broadcasting to Citadel Communications. Ashley & Murphy in the Morning, WRMX/WTXM Murphy soon landed a job working with Ashley Adams at Oldies 95.7 & 106.7 (WRMX & WTXM). The morning show was renamed Ashley & Murphy in the Morning. Murphy was let go in early 2005, shortly before the station adopted the satellite-delivered Jack FM format. Marc & Kim and Frank Show, WWST In April 2005, Murphy joined Marc Anthony and Kim Hansard for the Marc & Kim and Frank show at Star 102.1 (WWST). It was renamed the Marc & Kim Show in June 2013 when Frank left the show to concentrate on his duties at sister station WNOX.

Murphy hosted the station's morning show from January 2 to September 4, 2020. Television career In 2016, Murphy began hosting East Tennessee PBS Scholars' Bowl, a long-running televised academic quiz show in which high school teams compete in a single-elimination tournament. He was one of two hosts for the 2017 and 2018 seasons and became the sole host beginning with the show's 35th season, which aired in 2019. Scholar's Bowl has been on East Tennessee PBS since 1985. Previous hosts include Hop Edwards, Diana Morgan, Sanda Allyson, Jack Ryan, and Ernie Roberts. Approximately 60 episodes are recorded each October and November. The shows air on weeknights during January, February, and March and are repeated over the summer. Improv career Murphy took an improv class in 2000 from the City of Burbank Department of Parks & Recreation. The class was titled \\"Improv for Ages 13 and Up\\" and was taught by Steve Saracino. In June 2002, Murphy joined the comedy improv group Einstein Simplified. They perform short-form improv every Tuesday night at Scruffy City Hall on Market Square in downtown Knoxville. Prior to Scruffy City Hall, the troupe performed at Manhattan's, Patrick Sullivan's, The Square Room, Side Splitters, and The Well. In addition to their weekly show, the members of Einstein Simplified perform at private parties and corporate functions. For three years they performed at the First Night Knoxville celebration on New Year's Eve. The group was cast in the partially improvised horror film \\"Fish Bait\\" in 2008. Filming took place in early October on Norris Lake. Murphy plays a character named \\"Frank\\" who books a fishing trip with three buddies when things go awry. In 2019, filmmaker John Hudgens began filming a documentary titled \\"Chair!\\" that explores comedy improv through the experience of Einstein Simplified's 25th anniversary. Blogging Murphy wrote a blog on his website from 2005 to 2015. He often wrote about the Body Farm, radio, TV, figs, Catholicism and improv.

The Pereyra Iraola Park is a Provincial Park and is the largest urban park located in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is the richest center of biodiversity in the province. The land used to belong to the Pereyra Iraola family, who acquired it from Juana Rita Pinto. In 1949, the family was expropriated by the government headed by General Juan Domingo Peron to build a community park which was opened a year later. The park measures 10,246 hectares and is located between the cities of Berazategui, Ensenada, Florencio Varela and La Plata. During the second presidency of General Peron, the area encompassing the current park and the train station that links the Buenos Aires train station Constitución with the La Plata train station, were called Derechos de la Ancianidad (trans. \\"Rights of the Elderly\\").

He is mentioned as a member of the princely Nakonid dynasty in the medieval chronicles of Thietmar of Merseburg and Widukind of Corvey. He was the co-ruler of the Obotrites, and, according to Thietmar's Chronicle written in 1012/1018, the brother of Prince Nakon. Widukind, in his Res gestae Saxonicae about 70 years earlier, mentioned a princeps barbarorum as Nakon's brother, though without giving his name. Both ruled over large territories of the Polabian Slavs, roughly corresponding to present-day Mecklenburg and the adjacent parts of Holstein up to the Elbe river. Another interpretation denotes Stoigniew as an autonomous ruler in the Circipania territory. An entry in the Annales Sangallenses maiores report that in October 955, Stoigniew led the united Slavic forces of Obotrite, Veleti, Circipani and Tollensians into the Battle on the Raxa against the East Frankish (German) king Otto I. Previous negotiations with the Saxon margrave Gero had failed. The Obotrites were defeated and Stoigniew was beheaded by one of Otto's knights.

Mr. Jonas Woodward, a leading businessman in Wellington, founded the Congregational church in Wellington in May 1842, and because this gave rise to a long term church, it is considered by all as the first. There was considerable growth in both North and South Islands with churches established in Auckland in 1851, Dunedin in 1862 and Christchurch in 1864 and many other places also. The 1875 Census lists the Congregational Independents as the fourth largest Protestant Denomination in Auckland, and the fifth largest in 'The Colony.' Initially because of lack of roads, two unions were formed, one in the North Island the other mainly in the South Island. These merged to form the Congregational Union of New Zealand (CUNZ) in 1884. In 1890s women were admitted to the Assembly as full members. In 1902 the Presbyterian church made overtures to the CUNZ and the Methodist Churches regarding church union. Discussions on this were held occasionally over many years but no real action was taken. However, in 1943 the Raglan Congregational church merged with the Presbyterian church to form the first Union church in New Zealand. In 2019 this church severed all ties with the Presbyterian and Methodist churches and became a Congregational church again. A few months later the Assembly of the CUNZ severed all ties with the Uniting Churches of Aotearoa New Zealand (UCANZ), as the body was now called. From the very beginning the CUNZ had had strong links with the London Missionary Society, both in sending and supporting missionaries, so in 1947 it accepted responsibility for their work in churches in the Pa _cific_ islands of Samoa, Cook Islands, and Niue. In 1969 a majority of the ministers and churches associated with the CUNZ, including the Pacific Island Congregational Churches, split and merged with the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand.Our History  1 - Congregational Union of NZ The minority remained as the Congregational Union of New Zealand.

History George Bain Johnston was born at Cockenzie, in the county of Haddington, Scotland, and was educated at Steel's Hospital in the parish of Tranent. At the age of 15 he served an apprenticeship on the schooner Mary Donaldson, under Captain James Donaldson, in the employ of Captain Hew (or Hugh) Francis Cadell (ca. 1790 – 27 April 1873). He was one of a group of Scotsmen who left Scotland in 1853 as one of the crew of the Lioness, a small River Mersey steamer of 70 tons register, which was purchased by Cadell to be used for towing purposes in Port Melbourne. The vessel was rigged as a three-masted schooner in Scotland and sailed out to Melbourne. Other members of the crew of the Lioness, all associated with the opening of the Murray, were James Ritchie, Thomas Johnston, John Barclay,John Barclay (ca. 1826 – 1 November 1886) married Margaret Johnston, sister of George Johnston sen. John McDonald, William Barker and John Ritchie. The four first named returned to Scotland for Captain Cadell in December 1853 in the Admiral, returning to Australia in 1854 in the brig Lady Emma, with the river steamers Gundagai and Albury in sections as freight. These vessels were assembled at Port Adelaide, and steamed through the Murray mouth. On 18 October 1857, the wives of these gentlemen left Scotland in the sailing ship Planter, arriving in Melbourne on 12 January 1858. The first vessel to come alongside to welcome these lady pioneers was the Lioness, the little craft that had left Scotland four years previously with the husbands of all the members of the party. These ladies had booked their passages in the Great Britain, but prior to sailing this vessel was commandeered by the British authorities for service as a troop ship in connection with the Indian mutiny. Johnston joined the rush to the gold diggings at Forest Creek and in 1853 joined Hew's son Captain Francis Cadell, the River Murray pioneer, and moved to Goolwa, where in 1857 he purchased a plot of land in \\"Little Scotland\\" and built a substantial dwelling \\"Cockenzie House\\". His first expedition was to take a survey of the Murray from Wentworth downwards in a small boat — the Quiz — recording obstacles that lay in the river. His next trip was with Captain Cadell in the steamer Lady Augusta. In 1855 he was appointed captain of the steamer Albury, and was the first to reach the town of Albury. The residents celebrated his arrival with a banquet and presented him with a purse of one hundred sovereigns, with which a suitable cup was bought and engraved to commemorate the occasion. After continuing in this trade for some years he joined Charles Murphy as \\"Johnston & Murphy\\", and purchased the Moolgewanke (the boat with which he explored the Edward River, and which came to a terrible end ) from Cadell, and soon afterwards the Albury. They prospered and became substantial steamboat proprietors and traders on the Murray and its tributaries. In 1862 they built the stern-wheeler Maranoa. In 1863 Capt. Johnston returned to Scotland to superintend the building of a paddle steamer, the Murray, which was brought out under canvas by Richard Barry, Capt. Johnston returning via Melbourne. This boat proved unsuitable, and was sold to Gippsland Lakes traders. In 1873 the partnership was dissolved, and Capt. Johnston traded alone. In 1877 he again returned to his homeland to build a suitable steamer — the well-known Queen of the South which did good service during the busy season of 1878-1879. On his arrival at Goolwa he was presented with a handsome silver epergne. Another large steamer was built at Goolwa, the Cadell, the engines of which were brought from Scotland in the Queen of the South. Johnston then constructed his last vessel, the Monarch, said to have the largest carrying capacity of any boat on the rivers. During the last few years business was carried on in partnership with Mr. Kirkpatrick of Wilcannia as Geo. Johnston & Co. He died at Queenstown, New Zealand, where he had travelled in the hope of respite after a considerable period of ill health. His body was returned to Australia in a lead coffin and interred at Currency Creek, South Australia Character Captain Johnston was described as one of the Murray's most successful navigators, and a loyal, intelligent, and enterprising colonist. He was a strong swimmer, and was reckoned to have saved from drowning no less than fourteen lives, among them a Mrs. Padman and her daughter, and was honored with a medal from the Royal Humane Society. Though industrious and enterprising in business matters, he was a liberal and earnest Christian. He was associated with the Wesleyan Church from its infancy at Goolwa, and was a most enthusiastic and energetic worker in all its activities. Family In 1852 he married Elizabeth Barclay (ca. 1831 – 25 September 1920), daughter of James Barclay, of Cockenzie, Scotland, who came out to Australia in 1858. She was closely associated with the Methodist Church. Elizabeth was sister of John Barclay of Mundoora, South Australia. Children of George and Elizabeth included: *eldest son Peter George Johnston (ca. 1859 – 2 June 1900) was a marine engineer, resident in Fremantle for many years. *Hugh Francis Cadell Johnston (ca.

Biography Baron was raised in Manhattan, son of two movie fans who would go as far as driving to Connecticut to see new pictures. He would inherit this appreciation for cinema, going as far as screening 16 mm films he got from a neighbor who worked at Paramount Pictures on his basement. Baron received his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1976, majoring in English Literature. He also studied criticism at St. Clare's College, in Oxford England. After leaving college, Baron went to Los Angeles to enter the movie industry, living in Malibu with a friend who was going to USC Film School. After a few months in LA, he got a job at Bullock's and eventually began his movie career in the mailroom at Universal Studios. After he met Lauren Shuler, a young producer who had gotten a job to run the West Coast Division of Martin Poll Productions, he decided to become a runner for Shuler. He became a production assistant on the first film made by the company, 1981's Nighthawks. Afterwards he worked on Continental Divide, where he met both his wife and producer Bill Badalato, who hired Baron as his assistant. Then Baron did varied jobs: location coordinator for The Man with Two Brains, Badalato's assistant in Top Gun, production assistant for Weeds, production associate on 1969, and first assistant director on Stand Alone. In 1990, Baron worked as a producer and executive at HBO Pictures, where he helped develop the TV series Tales from the Crypt. Then he got a job in 20th Century Fox through his producer friend Tom Jacobson, who became Executive Vice-President of the studio and introduced Baron to Jon Landau. Then Baron supervised successful projects such as The Last of the Mohicans, Edward Scissorhands, Hot Shots!, Broken Arrow, and Bulworth. When Baron renegotiated his contract in the late 1990s, he negotiated a right to produce as well. After some invitations, he accepted Baz Luhrmann's call to produce Moulin Rouge!, and stepped down from his executive job to spend three years (1999–2001) working on the film. Moulin Rouge! was much successful, earning Baron a Darryl F. Zanuck Producer of the Year Award from the Producers Guild of America and an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. Baron then returned to his job at Fox, overseeing aspects of Moulin Rouge! as well as prepping new features for the studio. In 2002, he was promoted to executive vice president of Feature Production. Baron's most common task in his job is contacting production teams spread around the globe, as \\"We travel the world to find the best locations to make our films as cost effective as possible\\" given Fox's politics of producing tent pole films at smaller budgets compared to other major film studios. Baron helped create the PGA Green Initiative, which advocates for green politics and sustainable filmmaking, and won a prize at the 2011 Environmental Media Awards. In 2011, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed him for the California Film Commission, which aims to keep film and television industry projects in the state.

Authorship  The author of Geumo sinhwa is Kim Si-seup (金時習, 1435-1493). His courtesy name (子 ja) is Yeolgyeong (悅卿), and he used pen names Cheonghanja (淸寒子), Maewoldang (梅月堂), and Dongbongsanin (東峯山人). Born in a village to the north of Seonggyungwan, the foremost educational institution in Korea during the late Goryo and Joseon dynasties, Kim was an exceptionally bright child. He gained fame as a five-year-old who was able to read and comprehend the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean. There is a well- known anecdote about King Sejong, who upon hearing about Kim’s genius summoned Kim to the palace to grant him silk and encourage his talent. In 1455, at the age of 17, Kim gave up his studies and became a Buddhist monk upon hearing that King Danjong abdicated the throne to his uncle Suyang Daegun. King Danjong came to the throne at the age of 12, and his uncle Suyang Daegun started a revolt (癸酉靖難 Gyeyujeongnan) in 1453 to eliminate the king’s close associates, seized power, and ultimately usurped the throne from King Danjong three years after he came to the throne. When this happened, Kim lost his will to enter government service. Instead, he pretended to be insane and led a life of a vagabond. After some time, six courtiers were killed for plotting to reinstate King Danjong to the throne, and, in one anecdote, Kim collected the corpses of the dead courtiers that people were too afraid to go near and buried them in Noryangjin. The six courtiers who were killed are known as Sayuksin (死六臣 six subjects who were killed for staying loyal to King Danjong to the throne), and Kim Si-seup became one of the Saengyuksin (生六臣 six subjects who survived and stayed loyal to King Danjong). After wandering from place to place and writing poetry and prose, Kim settled in Mount Geumo and lived as a Buddhist monk. He participated in the project for translating Buddhist scriptures that King Sejo started. It is assumed that Kim wrote Geumo sinhwa at this time, when Kim was between the ages of 31 and 36 (1465-1470). After King Sejo died and was succeeded by King Seongjong, Kim began to study the Confucian Classics again in hopes of entering government service under the new king and contacted Seo Geo-jeong, who was in a high government position at the time. However, unable to enter government service, he went into hiding once again to study Buddhism and Taoism and write poetry and prose. After years of wanderings, Kim fell ill at Muryang Temple in Mount Hong in 1493 and died at the age of 59.  Plots  Geumo sinhwa contains five novellas written in Chinese characters. They are all fantasy stories about people experiencing supernatural or unrealistic events. Manboksa jeopogi is a story about a young man surnamed Yang, who is orphaned at an early age. While leading a solitary life at Manbok Temple, he wins a game of jeopo against the Buddha and marries a beautiful woman. But the woman is actually a ghost who died during an invasion and has to go to the underworld soon. After parting with his ghost wife, Yang mourns her and spends the rest of his life alone and unmarried. Yisaeng gyujang-jeon tells the love story of Yi and Lady Choe. One day, on his way to study the Confucian Classics, Yi happens to look over a wall surrounding a house. He sees Lady Choe and falls in love with her. The two exchange love poems and eventually marry. But soon after their marriage, Lady Choe is killed during the Red Turban Rebellion. However, the dead Lady Choe comes home to Yi, and even though Yi knows that she is a ghost he leads a happy life with her as before. After three or four years, Lady Choe leaves this world, and several months later Yi falls ill and dies. Chwiyu Bubyeokjeonggi is a story about a young man surnamed Hong who visits Pyeongyang Castle, where he recites poetry in drunken happiness and meets a seonnyeo (fairy). The fairy tells him about herself: she is the daughter of the sage king Gija of Gojoseon, who when Wiman usurped the throne began to wander aimlessly and eventually became a fairy. She composes and recites poetry with Hong and leaves at daybreak. Afterward, Hong falls ill, longing to see the fairy again, and passes away, dreaming of becoming an immortal deity. Namyeombujuji is a story about a dream of a young man surnamed Bak, who was studying for the civil service examination during the reign of King Sejo. He is skeptical about the teachings of the Buddha and the existence of ghosts. Then one day, he dreams about going to South Yeomjubu, which is one of the Buddhist hells. There he meets Yeomra, the King of the Underworld. After conversing with Bak about Buddhism, ghosts, politics, and a variety of other topics, Yeomra is impressed by Bak’s knowledge and passion and succeeds his throne to him. Bak wakes from his dream but soon falls ill and dies. After his death, immortal beings appear in the dreams of Bak’s neighbors and tell them that Bak will be the next king of the Underworld. Yonggung buyeon-rok tells a story about a young man surnamed Han who was known for his writing skills in the Goryeo Dynasty visiting the underwater Dragon Palace at the invitation of the Dragon King who lives at the Bakyeon Falls. One evening, Han is led by two court officials to the Dragon Palace, where the Dragon King praises Han of his reputation and requests him to write a letter for ceremonies marking the completion of the foundations of a building (sangnyangmun). After writing the letter, Han enjoys a feast and has a tour of the palace. Upon returning home, he realizes that everything that happened was just a dream. Han then goes into the mountains and lives like a hermit.  Features and significance   Jeongi soseol (fantasy fiction)  Geumo sinhwa is an early Korean fiction, considered to have perfected the conventions of a jeongi (fantasy) novel. Jeongi (傳奇) is a genre of classical Chinese literature originating from Tang China. Jeongi novels were and enjoyed in countries in the East Asian Sinosphere, such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. As it combines lyricism with narrative and is written in a variety of styles, it is fundamentally a literary genre appreciated by intellectuals of the time. Korean intellectuals began to write jeongi novels in the late Silla and early Goryeo dynasties. But as the genre was created in connection with seolhwa (folk narratives), early jeongi fiction from this time period feels poorly written, as there is a strong sense of folk narratives in terms of the plot, character formation, and detailed descriptions. Using the grammar of jeongi fiction, Kim revolutionized the genre conventions and aesthetics of jeongi fiction in Geumo sinhwa. The conventional grammar of jeongi fiction perfected in Geumo sinhwa underwent a big change in the 17th century, when the length of narratives increased and plots began to reflect social issues. However, the conventions of jeongi novels in terms of form and social issues did not continue into the 18th and 19th centuries, and jeongi novels from this time were no longer central to Korean literature. Geumo sinhwa is a representative jeongi fiction, and the grammar of the genre that was perfected in this work continued to impact later Korean literature, including Sin Gwang-han’s short story collection Gijaegiyi (Strange Stories of Gijae) from the 16th century, as well as 17th-century jeongi novels such as Jusaeng-jeon (Tale of Ju), Unyeong-jeon (雲英傳Story of Unyeong), and Choe Cheok-jeon (崔陟傳 Tale of Choe Cheok). It also influenced the writing of novels such as Guunmong. Geumo sinhwa was also introduced to Japan, and adaptations of the stories in Geumo sinhwa were published in Otogiboko (伽婢子), a short story collection written in 1666.  Background  It is important to look at both domestic and overseas influences concerning the creation of Geumo sinhwa. In terms of domestic influences, Geumo sinhwa was created under Korea’s past literary traditions. It was influenced by various folk narratives that were passed down for generations, including folk narratives about ghosts, ghosts and humans falling in love, and virtuous women, as well as jeongi fiction from the late Silla and early Goryeo dynasties such as Choe Chiwon, and gajeon (假傳, personified allegorical biography) written in Chinese characters. In terms of overseas influences, Geumo sinhwa was greatly influenced by China’s Jiandeng xinhua (剪燈新話 New Tales for the Trimming of the Lamps). Kim Si-seup praised Jiandeng xinhua and even wrote a review of the work. Geumo sinhwa shows strong influences of Jiandeng xinhua in terms of topics and plot structure, but it is not a simple imitation. Kim had a deep understanding of the aesthetics and characteristics of jeongi fiction, and his exceptional literary talent and creativity culminated in the writing of Geumo sinhwa.  Features  Geumo sinhwa has the following characteristics. First, while many classical Korean fiction are set in China, the stories in Geumo sinhwa are set in Korea, such as Gojoseon, Goryeo, and Joseon dynasties. The characters are also Korean, and the time periods are also realistic. Second, there are unrealistic and fantastic elements, such as ghosts, Taoist immortals, Yeomra, the Dragon King, Yeombuju, and the Dragon Palace, in the stories, which embody the sufferings and anguish of the underprivileged and solitary main characters. Third, the main characters who get a taste of the supernatural world often become weary of life and eventually pass away, and as a result the stories tend to be tragic in nature. Fourth, the main characters in the story maintain their integrity and fidelity even in the face of misfortunes. Such emphasis on integrity and fidelity is related to the author Kim Si-seup’s experience when King Sejo usurped the throne. Fifth, many inserted poems and the poetic writing style provide detailed descriptions of the characters’ psyche and also emphasize the lyrical nature of the work.  Other  Modern retellings of Geumo sinhwa include Choi In-hun’s short story \\"Geumo Sinhwa\\" (금오신화 New Tales from Mount Geumo) (1963) and four volumes of Sim Sang-dae’s Sin geumo sinhwa (신금오신화 New Geumo Sinhwa) (1999-2004). It was also adapted into performances such as: Jeopo nori (저포놀이 A Game of Jeopo), a play written by Lee Ha-ryun and performed in 1981; Yisaeng gyujang-jeon: eojireolsa kkonnipun damneomeo pigo (이생규장전-어지럴사 꽃잎은 담넘어 피고 Tale of Yi Looking Over the Wall: A Whirl of Flowers Blossom Over the Wall), a changgeuk (traditional Korean musical drama) performed by the National Changgeuk Company of Korea in 1993; Yeongwonhan sarang: Yisaeng gyujang-jeon (영원한 사랑-이생규장전 Eternal Love: Tale of Yi Looking Over the Wall), a musical performance of jeongga (right song), performed at the National Gugak Center in 2011 and 2012. Manboksa jeopogi was also adapted into a changgeuk by Hwang Ui-seong and performed in Namwon in 2002. In addition, Yisaeng gyujang- jeonwas also adapted into an animation of the same title by director Kim In- woong in 2016.  Texts  Geumo sinhwa appears in several historical records from the 15th century, which suggests that it was widely read in the Joseon Dynasty. However, it seems to have become a rare book after the mid-Joseon Dynasty, as it is difficult to find records of Geumo sinhwa let alone copies of the book. Only the texts of Yisaeng gyujang-jeon and Manboksa jeopogi can be found today, as two of the nine stories transcribed by Kim Jip (金集, 1574-1656) in Sindokjae sutaekbon jeongijip (愼獨齋手澤本傳奇集 Collection of Fantasy Fiction Revised by Sindokjae). Geumo sinhwa was also introduced to Japan during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592 to 1598. It was privately owned and enjoyed until 1653, when it was published as woodblock prints. This edition became the original script that was reprinted in Japan in 1653, 1660, and 1673, and Geumo sinhwa became widely read throughout Japan. In 1884, a newly edited version of Geumo sinhwa was published along with several reviews in Tokyo. Choe Nam-seon, who saw a copy of the book, introduced Geumo sinhwa back to Korea in 1927 by publishing photoprints of the book in the magazine Gyemyeong volume 19. Until the 1990s, this edition of Geumo sinhwa was mainly circulated in Korea. In 1999, an edition published by Yun Chun-nyeon (尹春年, 1514-1567) while he served as the Deputy Director of the Printing Office from 1546 to 1567 was discovered in the Dalian Library in China. Afterward, this edition was established as the best-preserved copy.

It was originally theatrically released in the US on a double bill with \\"Jack, the Giant Killer\\" (1962) before being sold to television in the U.S. The film was later released to American television retitled Ursus, Son of Hercules as part of the Sons of Hercules TV syndication package (although Ursus was not related to Hercules at all in the original Italian version). Filmed in Madrid in 1960, and released in Italy on Feb. 1, 1961, this movie stars bodybuilder Ed Fury as the legendary Ursus, and Moira Orfei as the evil queen Attea, in a sword-and-sandal adventure.Poppi, PecorariHughes Ed Fury is the actor most often associated with the Ursus series, although he only played him in three of the nine films. The film is rife with villains, in the true peplum tradition, including Moira Orfei as the evil queen, Luis Prendes as the smarmy Setas, and Rafael Luis Calvo as Mok, the grand vizier. A young Soledad Miranda plays the beautiful virgin Fillide who is to be sacrificed at the end of the film. Miranda was later \\"discovered\\" by Spanish horror film director Jesus Franco who used her in a number of his 1969-1970 productions, beginning with his 1970 opus Count Dracula. (She was killed in a tragic car accident in 1970).

Victorious, he returns home planning to marry his fiancée Attea, only to learn that she had been kidnapped in his absence by a bizarre religious cult that inhabits a far off island. Ursus enlists the aid of a young blind slave girl, Doreide, whom he used to know as a child, and together they embark on a quest to locate and rescue his lost Attea. Unbeknownst to Ursus, Doreide is in love with him, but doesn't let Ursus know, since she feels he will only be happy if he is reunited with Attea. After overcoming various villains who do not want him to locate the cult's island base, Ursus and Doreide finally arrive on the island, only to be captured by the cult and their masked queen, an evil woman who orders the sacrificing of virgins to her satanic bull-god. Much to his dismay, Ursus learns that the queen is in fact his ex-fiancée Attea. After being kidnapped by the cult, Attea had somehow managed to trick the cultists into making her their leader, and over the past three years, she degenerated into a cold, heartless monster. The queen commands that Doreide be sacrificed, and Ursus is sent in chains to slave in a hellish work camp. Ursus manages to escape his captivity and kill the treacherous Setas, an old friend of Ursus' who he learns orchestrated the kidnapping of Attea years before. Ursus then makes his way to the great arena, just in time to rescue Doreide from being mauled to death by a massive bull. Ursus physically wrestles the bull to the ground in a spectacular battle of sinews, and then leads a slave revolt against the queen and her sycophants. In the battle, Doreide receives a blow to the head which miraculously restores her vision. The queen is stabbed to death by her own grand vizier Mok, who in turn is strangled by Ursus. With the freeing of the slaves, Ursus and Doreide sail off back to their homeland, with Ursus finally realizing that Doreide is the only woman for him. (Strangely, none of the other Ursus films involve the Doreide character, so it's a mystery why she disappeared so quickly from the series after this first film.) Ursus is shown as a very violent character in this film, actually strangling several of the other characters to death in various scenes when he could easily have just rendered them unconscious.

Actors Ambarish and V. Ravichandran were the chief guests invited for the launch at the Kanteerava Studios in Bangalore. The film marks the first Kannada production set to shoot in Iceland. Casting While Darshan and Karthika had the lead roles, the second female lead role was first offered to Vedhika Kumar; Malayalam actress Muktha replaced her in the role, and still later it went to newcomer Milana Nagaraj.  Story  The main story of the film is about two step brothers, played by Saikumar and Sampath Raj. They are rival big shots in their village. Karthika Nair and Milana Nagaraj play cousins of theirs. Karthika Nair stays in the village, but Milana Nagaraj relocates for her studies to the city where Darshan lives. The two meet when he helps her, become friends, and eventually fall in love. Meanwhile, Karthika Nair's marriage is arranged with some goonda whom she does not want to marry. She asks Milana Nagaraj to help her; she in turn asks Darshan to help. He goes to the village intending to prevent the marriage using tricks. He ends up solving many problems in the village and finally putting an end to the rivalry between Saikumar and Sampath Raj, leading to a happy ending.  Release  Brindavana was released on 26 September in more than 190 theaters; the box office over 50 days was around 17 crore. Some other films, including Sakkare, Sweety Nanna Jodi, and Dilwala postponed their release to avoid clashing with it. The satellite telecast rights were offered up to a price of 5.40 crore, making it the second highest-priced Kannada-language film.  25 days celebration  On the 25th day after the film's release there was a grand celebration in Gandhinagar Narthaki theatre (the main theatre of Brindavana). A blood donation camp was held, with Darshan, Milana, director Madesh, and others in attendance. Darshan's fans announced some days before on social networking sites that he would be there; there was such a large crowd that police came to disperse them and blocked all traffic. The theater was damaged; producer Srinivasamurthy paid the resulting costs. Soundtrack The music was composed by V. Harikrishna and released by D-Beats.

The Husseins are originally from Al-Awja, about 13 kilometers from Tikrit, and are members of the minority Sunni population. They are members of the al-Begat tribal group, a sub-group of the Al-Bu Nasir tribe. Since records are scant, the generation who controlled Iraq primarily are only known to stem from Saddam's mother Subha Tulfah al-Mussallat or her brother Khairallah Talfah, who later became Saddam's father-in-law. All the members of the Hussein or extended Talfah family have the Arabic surname Al-Tikriti and trace their origins to Al-Awja or several surrounding villages. During the rule of Saddam Hussein, family connections became a crucial part of Iraqi politics and many of his close family members were in charge of the ministries, military, and the Security Services.

He was arranged to marry Subha Tulfah al- Mussallat, allegedly a village psychic, when they were teenagers. Both of them were members of the al-Khatab clan of the al-Begat tribal group, a sub-group of the Al-Bu Nasir tribe. He disappeared several months before Saddam was born and shortly after, Saddam's only full brother, a 13-year-old brother, died of cancer. Her situation was so poor that she allegedly attempted to abort the unborn fetus, and when that failed, she sent him away to her brother Khairallah. After his death Subha married Ibrahim Al-Hassan, who was another illiterate shepherd (some sources claim he was actually a local bandit) from an even poorer family. She had three more sons with Ibrahim and a couple of daughters. Subha later arranged for Saddam to marry the daughter of her brother, Khairallah, when they were children, though they were never married until 1963, when Saddam was 26.Eric Davis, Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq, University of California Press, 2005. * Saddam Hussein (1937–2006), President of Iraq 1979–2003 Sajida Talfah, wife of Saddam and former first lady. ** Uday Hussein (1964–2003), director of the Iraqi Football Association, Fedayeen Saddam, and several media corporations in Iraq including Iraqi TV and the newspaper Babel.

Anilabha discovers a magic lamp from which a genie emerges and is able to take him to unseen heights in life that he never reached before and also life of extreme luxury and fortunes. How they adjust and cope with their new-found lives forms the rest of the story.  Theme  This is a modern-day fantasy tale and deals with contemporary consumerist society and consumerist trends.

Filming  In The Times of India of 4 December 2012, Anik Dutta revealed his plans of starting shooting by 11 December 2012 and completing it within January 2013. When asked about shooting in tailor made seasons like that of Durga Puja or Poila Boishakh, which are preferred by most directors, he stated that these issues were to be decided by the producers and not by him. Shooting started as expected in Shree Narayan Studio of Joka, Kolkata. Actor Rajatava Dutta got his head shaved for the first time for a film.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack of the film has been composed by Raja Narayan Deb who had also collaborated with the Anik Dutta, the director on his first and previous directorial venture, Bhooter Bhabishyat. The film being based upon a middle class man's overnight meteoric rise catapulted by his finding of a magic lamp, the soundtrack and the songs are also composed and written keeping in mind this aspect of the theme. The music changes after Anilabho (Saswata Chatterjee) discovers the lamp. It is subtle with the use of flute, clarinet, and oboe initially but after finding the magic lamp it grows more flashier and urban complete with bling using electronic sounds as well as heavy use of drums and guitars . The title song is replete with Arabic flavour and is sung by Timir and Rishi Chanda. It is a mish-mash of Arabic percussion that gradually paves the way for rock-infused track. The film consists of an item song Gimme More, sung by Tanya Sen, a member of Indie Band titled \\"Zoo\\" and has western and classical touch with the video version featuring Mumtaz Sorcar. The third song of the film titled Makeover song captures Chatterjee's drastic change from a common man to an uptown high society person. Another song called Office Office inspired by Hollywood musicals such as Fiddler On The Roof, Sound of Music and My Fair Lady among others is sung by the lead actors Chatterjee and Rajatava Dutta and Deb Roy ( Co-writer & Associate Director of the Film); the reason for doing so is the ability of the actors to personify the song as they portray the characters on-screen. Raja Narayan Deb also collaborates with Amit Kumar, son of legendary singer, Kishore Kumar for the song Charidik bodle gechhe a rendition of Prithibi bodle gechhe, sung by Kumar; Kumar also raps in the song. Though the melody and arrangements are still the same, the lyrics have been re-written by the director himself incorporating Dubstep, breakbeat and House elements into the song. Thus the entire soundtrack consists of these five tracks. The video for the item song Gimme More inspired by Mozart's 40th Symphony was released on YouTube on 1 November 2013. The video for the second songm called \\"Makeover Song\\", was released on YouTube on 4 November 2013 sung by Dibyendu Mukherjee, written by Anik Dutta and choreographed by Sudarshan Chakraborty featuring Rajatava Dutta and Saswata Chatterjee among others. ;Bonus Track  Release and reception  The film released on 15 November 2013.

The protagonist is a naked woman who represents a thinker's idea; as she goes out into the world, the frightened authorities unsuccessfully try to cover up her nudity. A man who stands up for her is executed, and violent suppression by big business greets a workers' revolution she inspires. Bartosch spent two years animating the film, initially in collaboration with Masereel. Bartosch used complicated techniques with multiple layers of superimposed animation to create the intricately detailed film. The film features an electronic music score by Swiss composer Arthur Honegger (1892–1955), possibly the earliest in film history. Synopsis A thinker sits by a window, and an idea comes to him in the form of a doll-sized naked woman. The thinker puts the woman in an envelope and sends her out into the world. She finds herself in an office building, where the frightened authorities attempt to clothe her, but she soon sheds the clothing. She becomes involved with a young working class man, and he appeals to the people on her behalf; he is captured and executed, and his coffin is carried through the streets by the people. Another man presses her into a book, and delivers handbills of her to the frightened people. She is captured by a businessman, and armed soldiers are sent to put down a revolution of the people; the people are suppressed, and the woman, now white- haired, becomes a star and drifts into the cosmos. Background Bartosch adapted Masereel's wordless novel The Idea (1920). Belgian artist Frans Masereel had had success in Europe in the 1920s with his wordless novels made from woodcuts; he pioneered the genre in 1918 25 Images of a Man's Passion. Passionate Journey followed the next year and caught the eye of German publisher Kurt Wolff, whose republication of it topped sales of 100,000 throughout Europe. In late 1929 filmmaker Janine Bouissounouse put Masereel in contact with the Surrealist painter Salvador Dalí, who was interested in including an animated sequence in a proposed film, which was never made. Berthold Bartosch, born in Austria-Hungary, began his animation career in the Soviet Union and Germany. He participated in such works as Lotte Reiniger's The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) before emigrating to France. Wolff encouraged Masereel and Bartosch to collaborate on a film adaptation of one of Masereel's wordless novels. They agreed in 1930 to collaborate on an adaptation of The Idea (1920). Production Production took years in a space over the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier. The film required 45,000 frames of up to four levels of animation each on layers of glass plate, and up to eighteen camera superimpositions. Bartosch combined drawings with hinged cardboard cutout characters. The layered approach exposures took considerable time with Bartosch's limited resources—the room was lit only with a few 100-watt bulbs. At first the two artists attempted an \\"animated woodcut\\" approach, but by March 1931 had rejected it in favour of a \\"more pictorial\\" one. Masereel found animation work tedious and backed out partway through; Bartosch finished the production in mid-1932. He combined and synthesized various animation techniques he had learned over his career and developed new ones such as blurring back-lit images with soap. Richard Neupert called Bartosch's methods \\"a very personal mode of production\\". Bartosch was handicapped from birth so that he had great difficulty walking; Richard Neupert speculates this may have accustomed the animator to long, solitary hours of work. Score Masereel considered Georges Auric for the score, but found the composer's music \\"soppy\\" and a poor match for the work. Masereel had long been acquainted with the Swiss composer Arthur Honegger via the avant-garde theatre groupe . Honegger had previously composed film scores only twice, for Abel Gance's La Roue (1923) and Napoléon (1927). Masereel convinced him to produce a score for The Idea, which Honegger finished by spring 1934. An ondes Martenot, an electronic instrument used in the score; likely the first instance of electronic music used in film The sound version of the film appeared in 1934. Honegger used an ondes Martenot in what is likely the first instance of electronic music in film. The score is in ten parts: # \\"\\" # \\"\\" # \\"\\" # \\"\\" # \\"\\" # \\"\\" # \\" # \\"\\" # \\"\\" # \\"\\" Analysis The film diverges from its source: In the end of Masereel's book, the woman returns to the thinker, while the film ends with the defeat of the woman. The film blends objective and subjective modes—at times realistic, at others characters can seem indistinct and changeable: the protagonist towers over others in one scene while in another is so small she slips into an envelope. The art style draws heavily from the German Expressionist-inflected artwork of the book and displays such influences as of Russian Constructivism poster art. The eerie atmosphere recalls German Expressionist films such as Lang's Metropolis (1927) Ruttmann's Berlin (1927). The narrative style cuts from scene to scene quickly and employs many superimpositions Reception and legacy A private preview of The Idea took place in Paris on 23 January 1932; the Belgian artist Henry van de Velde and the German writers Stefan Zweig and Klaus Mann were amongst the attendees. Mann lauded it as \\"of the highest ethical and artistic pathos\\". The official première—with Honegger's soundtrack—occurred in London in late 1934. Arthur Honegger went on to have a prolific career scoring films. The sound version found receptive audiences in Europe, though distribution was limited due to censorship over its socialist themes. Despite objections in the press the Nazis had it suppressed in Germany along with Masereel's other works, and it fell into obscurity. Honegger went on to become a prolific scorer of films, composing for at least forty. Bartosch made a number of animated advertisement films in the following years. He attempted an animated anti-war film in colour called Saint Francis: Dreams and Nightmares, but abandoned the work when he and his wife fled, as the Nazis descended on Paris. The completed portions disappeared during the Nazi occupation. A negative of The Idea was rediscovered at the Cinémathèque Française in 1959 and Bartosch participated in its reconstruction. Film historians continue to praise the work. Filmmaker Alexandre Alexeieff praised the film's mix of fantasy and \\"unrelenting reality\\" and described Bartosch's methods as \\"like Renaissance painters layer by layer, thus obtaining incredible fineness of tone\\". He declared, \\"It was Bartosch who first dared to give animation the dimensions of great art\\". Film historian William Moritz called The Idea \\"the first film created as an artwork with serious, even tragic, social and philosophical themes\\". Historian Perry Willett wrote that the film is at times unclear, and was \\"something of a disappointment\\". Animation historian Giannalberto Bendazzi assessed The Idea as \\"one of the rare films in which political commitment does not conflict with lyricism\\". Film historian and theorist Rishard Neupert called The Idea \\"an exotic animated project that combines a wild variety of textures and pacing into a truly unique product with its own rhythm, episodic structure, and frustrating logic\\". Historian Perry Willett found the film \\"something of a disappointment\\" and unclear at times.

The school is open to students from 4 to 18 years of age. Apart from a school opened by the Kuwait Oil Company for the children of its employees, (which closed two years after The English School Of Fahaheel Kuwait was founded) it was the first school in South Kuwait to provide English education. The chairman of the school is Ibrahim Shuhaiber and the current principal is Russell Dunlop. History In 1968, expatriates founded the school in South Kuwait. Following the closure of the only other English school in South Kuwait in 1970 the school built an extra block of classrooms and an assembly hall to accommodate the displaced students. In 1990, following the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait, the school premises were used as a command center by the Iraqi army and most of the school property was either destroyed or looted. After the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, the school was rebuilt with help from the British Army. In 2005 the school was moved to a newly built building in Mangaf, both larger and better equipped than the original. Qualifications IGCSE IGCSE examinations lead to the award of one of eight grades (A*, A, B, C, D, E, F and G) in each subject. The highest grade is A*, which matches A* in British GCSE examinations. Grades A, B and C are equivalent to the corresponding grades in the international GCE Ordinary Level and the British GCSE examinations. IGCSE certificates list results in all subjects in which the student earned a Grade G or better. Candidates who fail to achieve the minimum satisfactory standard of work in a subject receive no grade in that subject. In most subjects, candidates have a choice of sitting examinations at one of two levels: Core or Extended. The Extended examination is more challenging and is designed for candidates seeking a Grade C or above. The Core paper is structured to allow students the chance of being awarded a Grade C, even though they expected a lower grade. The examination certificate does not indicate which examination the student took. A Level Almost all universities, especially in the Faculties of Medicine and Engineering, look for applications from students who have completed examinations at a level higher than IGCSE. The standard of the syllabus contents in A/S Level program of study is the same educationally as that of the Advanced Level (‘A’ Level) examination in England. However, the course content is not as large as a full ‘A’ level, and so can be completed in one year. It is credited as a half A Level in universities and colleges worldwide. Students who started their ’A’ Level studies in Year 11 would normally finish them in Year 12. Alternatively, students may wish to finish Year 11 before commencing their ‘A’ Level studies, in Year 12.

Cependant il observe que ce droit exerçait moins d’autorité dans l’île des Bataves. Il aborde ensuite son sujet aidé de MM. Savigny et Raepsaet.

It was created on 1 March 1943 from the remnants of the 284th Rifle Division, in recognition of that division's stalwart defense against the German Sixth Army in the Battle of Stalingrad, in particular the Mamayev Kurgan hill and parts of the city's center. The 79th Guards continued a record of distinguished service through the rest of the Great Patriotic War, and continued to serve postwar, in several roles, until being finally disbanded in 1992. It became the 20th Guards Mechanized Division in 1945, 27th Guards Tank Division in 1957, and the 79th Guards Tank Division in 1965. It served with the 8th Guards Army from 1943 until it was disbanded.  World War II   Formation  The 79th Guards was one of several Guards rifle divisions created on 1 March 1943 in the aftermath of the fighting for Stalingrad. It was formed from the remnants of the 284th Rifle Division, in recognition of that division's stalwart defense against the German 6th Army in the Battle of Stalingrad, in particular the Mamayev Kurgan hill and parts of the city's center; it inherited the Order of the Red Banner that the 284th received for these actions on 8 February. When formed, its major units included the: * 216th Guards Rifle Regiment from 1043rd Rifle Regiment * 220th Guards Rifle Regiment from 1045th Rifle Regiment * 227th Guards Rifle Regiment from 1047th Rifle Regiment * 172nd Guards Artillery Regiment from 820th Artillery Regiment. The 284th Rifle Division's commander, Nikolay Batyuk, continued in command, being promoted to the rank of Major General on the day of the division's redesignation as well. The 62nd Army was renamed as the 8th Guards Army on 16 April, and the 79th Guards remained in the latter, in 28th Guards Rifle Corps, for the duration of the war.  Advance across Ukraine  Transferred to the Southwestern Front with the army, the division crossed the Seversky Donets on 18 June near the village of Prishib, capturing a bridgehead, which it fought to retain and expand for the next several weeks. The army fought in the Izyum-Barvenkovo Offensive in July, during which the division fought in fierce fighting on the Izyum bridgehead in the Donbass during the Donbass Strategic Offensive. Batyuk died of illness on 28 July, and was replaced by Colonel Leonid Vagin, who was promoted to Major General on 17 November. After the capture of Barvenkovo on 10 September, the 79th Guards subsequently fought in the Battle of the Dnieper, advancing towards Zaporizhia. For its actions in the recapture of Zaporozhe on 14 October during the latter, the division received the name of the city as an honorific: After crossing the Dnieper on 25 October south of Voyskovoye and for the next four months fought towards Nikopol in the attempts to recapture the far southern portion of Right-bank Ukraine as part of the 3rd Ukrainian Front (formed from the Southwestern Front on 20 October). On 3 March, on the line of Shyroke, south of Krivoy Rog, during the Bereznegovatoye–Snigirevka Offensive, the division broke through German defenses on the western bank of the Inhulets River and participated in the recapture of Novy Bug. For its \\"exemplary performance of combat missions\\" in these actions, the division received the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class, on 19 March. During the Odessa Offensive the 79th Guards fought in the recapture of Odessa on 10 April. For their \\"courage and fighting skill\\" the division was awarded the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd class, on 20 April. After reaching the Dniester and capturing a bridgehead north of Bender, the division was withdrawn with the army to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command on 8 June.  Into Poland and Germany  With the army, the division was relocated to the Kovel region in June to join the 1st Belorussian Front, after receiving reinforcements. During the Lublin–Brest Offensive on 21 July the division crossed the Western Bug and entered Polish territory. Along with other units, it participated in the capture of Lublin on 24 July. It then crossed the Vistula near Skórecka, six kilometers northeast of Magnuszew. Among the first units of the river to cross were the division reconnaissance company and the 1st Battalion of the 216th Guards Rifle Regiment under the command of Captain Yefim Tsitovsky, who was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. The bridgehead was subjected to repeated German counterattacks for the next ten days, particularly on 8 August, for actions on which company commander Lieutenant Vladimir Burba and Private Pyotr Khlyustin of the 220th Guards Rifle Regiment were posthumously made Heroes of the Soviet Union. For their actions in the bridgehead, ten soldiers of the division received the award. After continued actions on the Magnuszew bridgehead, the division fought in the Warsaw–Poznan Offensive from mid-January 1945, fighting near Łódź, Pinne, and Skwierzyna and seizing a bridgehead across the Oder on the left bank of the river south of Kustrin at Reitwein on 3 February. Vagin was severely wounded during the latter action and evacuated to the hospital; he would later be made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership of the division. The division came under the temporary command of 47th Guards Rifle Division deputy commander Colonel Ivan Semchenkov between 6 February and 14 March as it fought to retain the Kustrin bridgehead. Semchenkov was replaced by Colonel Stepan Gerasimenko, who had just graduated from an accelerated course at the Higher Military Academy. After overcoming fierce German resistance in the Battle of the Seelow Heights, the division approached the city on 23 April. Gerasimenko was relieved of command on the next day for losing control of his troops; he was replaced by Major General Dmitry Stankevsky, the 79th Guards' last wartime commander. The army's final assault began two days later, with the division, backed by the 39th Guards, ordered to surround and capture Tempelhof Airfield, where it was suspected many German aircraft were hiding in underground hangars to fly out the Nazi leadership. After an assault crossing of the Teltow Canal the two divisions took the airfield and prevented out-going flights. Early on 2 May the 79th intercepted a radio transmission in Russian: The message was authorized by Helmuth Weidling, commander of the Berlin garrison, and led to the German surrender to Chuikov later that day, ending the war for the 79th Guards. For \\"exemplary performance of command tasks\\" in the Battle of Berlin, the division received the Order of Lenin on 28 May. In addition to nineteen Heroes of the Soviet Union, 11,000 soldiers of the division were decorated for their action during the war.  Postwar  Vagin returned from the hospital to command the 79th Guards in July 1945, and in October of that year they were redesignated as the 20th Guards Mechanized Division at Jena, serving with the 8th Guards Army in the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany (the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany from 1954); the division remained at Jena for the duration of the Cold War. Vagin commanded the division until he was transferred in February 1948. In July 1956 the division became directly subordinated to 8th Guards Army, after the 28th Guards Rifle Corps was disbanded. On 17 May 1957 it became the 27th Guards Tank Division. On 11 January 1965 it became the 79th Guards Tank Division, restoring its World War II numbering. The division remained at Jena until July 1992, when it was withdrawn to Samarkand in the Turkestan Military District. It was quickly disbanded after arrival there.

After the proclamation of the second Spanish Republic he joined the progressive and intellectual movements of his city and started to write in the local press. After studying to become a school teacher in Girona he moved first to Madrid and then to Barcelona to study philosophy. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936 he had to interrupt his studies and join the army. At the end of the War and with the republicans defeated, Corredor went into exile in Montpellier and finished his studies at the University there. When the Second World War ended he settled in the French Catalan city of Perpignan where he was married, had a daughter and started a prolific career as a cultural activist. Shortly he met the main figures from the Catalan exile such as Pompeu Fabra, Antoni Rovira i Virgili and Pablo Casals to whom Corredor became personal secretary. As a result of his relationship with the cellist, in 1955 appeared the book Conversations avec Pablo Casals: souvenirs et opinions d'un musicien. The book was an instant success and it was edited and translated to several languages. Josep Maria Corredor was also the catalyst for an international campaign to build a tomb for the Spanish poet Antonio Machado in Collioure. During the 1960s Corredor resumed his collaborations with the Catalan press and following the death of the dictator Francisco Franco he returned to Girona. However, the Spanish transition to democracy disappointed him and he found himself out of place. On 29 September 1981 Corredor committed suicide in Perpignan, where he is buried.

They are based largely in the Porbandar district, comprising the low-lying, wetland Ghēḍ and highland Barḍā areas. They speak a dialect of the Gujarati language. The Mers of the Ghēḍ and Barḍā form two groups of the jāti and together they are the main cultivators in the Porbandar District. Historically, the men served the Porbandar State as a feudal militia, led by Mer leaders. In the 1881 Gazette of the Bombay Presidency, the Mers were recorded numbering at 23,850. The 1951 Indian Census recorded 50,000 Mers. As of 1980 there were estimated to be around 250,000 Mers.  Origin  Mers of other lineages consider the Kēshwaḷā as the earliest and superior lineage citing the proverb: Ādya Mēr Kēshwaḷā, jēni suraj purē chē śakh - \\"the sun stands testimony to the fact that Kēshwaḷās are the original Mers.\\" An origin myth of the Kēshwaḷās descending from the neck hair of Rama was recorded by colonial authors. However, possibly the oldest reference to Kēshwaḷās indicates that the founder of this lineage may have lived over a thousand years ago, although, this relies on the genealogies of Barots which are not considered completely accurate as they are projected back in time to pseudo- history.Porbandar district,Gujarat where the majority of Mer people live  History  Mers were once associated with the Maitraka dynasty. Historically Mers were also considered Kshatriya and were second to Brahmins. The kin of those slain in action were paid 100 rupees (£10) by the Rana during the late 1800s. Mers did not pay rent on their land, only paying a hearth tax and if they cultivated, a plough tax in addition to sukhḍi (quit rent) on villages assigned to them. Historically, highland Mers, also known as Bhōmiyā (landed) held more political power than lowland Mers with the latter being restricted from buying land from Bhomiās between 1884 and 1947. In the 1970s Sarman Munja Jadeja rose to prominence after killing gangsters Devu and Karsan Vagher who had been hired by Nanji Kalidas Mehta to break the strike at the Maharana Mills. As the leader of organised crime in Porbandar he ran a parallel system of justice and was hailed by many Mers as a Robin Hood-like figure. After killing 47 people, he renounced violence having been influenced by the Swadhyay Movement. In 1986 he was murdered by a rival gang resulting in Santokben Jadeja taking over her husbands gang and killing 30 people to take revenge. By the 1990s her gang was wanted in 500 cases and she in 9. Shantokben died in 2011, following which a rival ganglord, Bhima Dula Odedara became dominant in local crime and politics. Odedara took control of the profitable limestone, chalk and bauxite mines; he was given double life imprisonment by the Gujarat High Court for double murder in 2017.  Mers in politics  Mers have dominated the politics of the Kutiyana Vidhan Sabha, the Porbandar Vidhan Sabha and the Porbandar Lok Sabha seats. The first Mer to become the MLA for Kutiyana was Indian National Congress member Maldevji Odedra in 1962; who also became the Gujarat Congress President. 1980 saw Congress candidate Vijaydasji Mahant elected and he retained his seat in 1985. Mahant also became the Gujarat Congress President. In 1990 Santokben Jadeja won the Kutiyana assembly seat as a Janata Dal candidate. In 1995 her brother- in-law Bhura Munja Jadeja became the MLA for Kutiyana contesting as an independent. After the Jadejas, the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Karsan Dula Odedara held the Kutiyana seat winning in 1999, 2002 and 2007. Since 2012 it has been held by Kandhal Jadeja a Nationalist Congress Party MLA and son of Santokben, who won again in 2017. Maldevji Odedra was elected from the Porbandar Vidhan Sabha seat in 1972 as an INC candidate. In 1985, Laxmanbhai Agath (INC) was elected. Babubhai Bokhiria (BJP) held the seat in 1995 and 1998, losing to Congress candidate Arjunbhai Modhwadiya in 2002. Modhwadiya maintained his seat in 2007 and became the Gujarat Congress President, but lost to Babubhai Bokhiria, who currently is the MLA for Porbandar, in 2012 and 2017. Maldevji Odedra held the Porbandar Lok Sabha seat in 1980 on behalf of INC. His son, Bharatbhai Odedra (INC) was elected in 1984 from Porbandar to the Lok Sabha.  Clans  The community is endogamous, that is, marriages take place within the community, but exogamous with respect to clan. That is the bride and groom belong to different clans (gotra) known as Bhāyāt. Genealogies of Mer families are maintained by Barots through name recording ceremonies. Mers consist of 14 clans called Śakh which are further split into segments called Pankhī: Society and culture Historically, Mers were wedded through arranged marriages, which were agreed between the parents of two new- borns. However, a girl married as a child would only be sent to live with her husband's family after achieving maturity. Cross-cousin marriage was common, while polygamous marriages were rare, only being permitted if a man was unable to have children with his first wife. The women of this community do not observe female seclusion norms and widow remarriage was not prohibited. Dowry operates largely in the favour of women. Differing from typical Hindu weddings, the Khaṁḍūṁ ceremony involves a sword being wed as a proxy for the groom. Grooms wear a jūmaṇuṁ made of twenty tolas of gold which has either been passed down or borrowed from relatives. Modern transport and equipment such as orchestra troupes are employed. Dates would be distributed in a custome called Lāṇ, to fellow villagers to celebrate a wedding or the birth of a son. Mers commission three types of Paliyas to venerate there ancestors. The first type is for surāpurā (lit. perfect brave, referring to warriors); the second for surdhan for ancestors who have died an unnatural death and finally for satis. They are venerated with sindoor by Mer descendants on Diwali. Mēr nō Rās (Dance of the Mer) a unique form of dandiya raas is performed. The performance includes liberal dusting of Gulal (vermillion) on the bodies and costumes of the dancers. Mer men used to wear umbrella shaped gold earrings called Śiṁśorīya; while Mer women wore bead shaped Vedla. Mer women also tattooed large parts of their body including the neck, arms and legs. Mer women were usually tattooed when they were about seven or eight years old. The hands and feet are marked first and then the neck and breast. It is customary for a girl to be tattooed before marriage. A Mer proverb states 'We may be deprived of all things of this world but nobody has the power to remove the tattoo marks\\". Mer tattoo motifs have a close relation to secular and religious subjects of devotion. Designs include holy men, feet of Rama or Lakshmi, women carrying water in pitchers on their head, Shravancarrying his parents on a lath (kāvad) to centers of pilgrimage, and popular gods like Rama, Krishna and Hanuman are also depicted. The lion, tiger, horse, camel, peacock, scorpion, bee and fly are other favorites.rightthumb Mer woman with traditional tattoos and earrings known as 'vedla'. Mers are mostly vegetarian, with pearl millet (Bājarō), sorghum (Jōwār) and wheat rotis being consumed with vegetables, chillis and curds. During weddings jaggery, ghee, lāpsi and khichdi is served. As of 1976, it has been reported that vices are common amongst Mers with around 30% consuming alcohol despite the prohibition in Gujarat. A 1980 study of the Mers estimated that: an average Mer household contains 6 people, 35% were literate, 95% of households owned their homes and 77% of household members were employed. 77% of those employed worked in the agricultural sector. Small scale plant-based industries are run by Mers, including bio-diesel production from the Mōgali āranḍ (Jatropha curcus L), herbal shampoo from Aloe and ground nut, sesame and castor oil extracting mills. Historically Mers were considered Kshatriya and were second to Brahmins. However, in the local caste system, Vaishyas would not consume food from Mers due to their consumption of meat, alcohol and hygiene. Traditionally some of the Vaishya castes would also not eat food from Rajputs, however Rajputs and Mers can consume food prepared by each other. This shows traditional Mers identify with other groups such as Kathis and Ahirs as part of the Kānṭio Varna or haughty groups. The Tēr Tāṁsḷī (13 bell-metal bowls), a group of thirteen communities that dine together but do not intermarry includes the Mers. In 1993 the Mandal Commission classified the Mers as an Other Backward Class.  Religion   Beliefs and practices  Mers are Hindus and practise a variety of religious traditions ranging from Folk Hinduism to Yogic and Bhakti practises. In addition, each lineage also has a lineage deity or Kuldevi, referred to as Āī (grand-mother) who is worshipped by lighting a lamp in front of the murti. While Mers worship all gods of the Hindu pantheon, devotion to Ramdev Pir and Vachhara Dada is a unique hallmark of Mer religious belief. Mer men and women maintain complete freedom in choosing their belief system and no member of a family forces another to follow their denomination. Mer men are expected to have a guru to provide personal religious advice; those without one are disparagingly called nagūrū (without a guru). The worship of Ramdev Pir is also formalised through a panth focusing on the worship of jyot and the secret Pāt ceremony is organised, breaking all caste and societal barriers. The Mers of Ghēḍ organise the Manḍap ceremony with Kolis and bring entire villages together in worship. Bhakti tradition is practised through the singing of bhajans about the Hindu epics; jiva; brahman; jnana; sannyasa; bhakti and moksha.[24][24] Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism are found amongst the Mers, with every village containing a temple to Shiva, Rama, and various forms of Devi. Amidst the worshippers of Devi, the presence of a small minority of secret Vamachara practitioners has also been noted; they are reputed to worship Kali with meat and alcohol. Within the Bhakti tradition the Pranami Sampraday is prevalent and devotees worship Krishna as Gopis. The Kabir panth also has a small following, functioning in open ceremonies under the guidance of a mahant. Some Mers follow Pirs based on individual experiences. Typical forms of Hindu worship such as aarti are common. Satis of the Charan jāti including Khodiyar are highly revered. When praying to Kuldevis, Satis or Vachhara Dada, the services of a bhuvā (shaman) are employed. Around marriage the goddess Randal is worshipped for fertility, while Brahmins are invited to recite the Satyanarayan Katha to pray for relief from difficult times.  Festivals and pilgrimages  Melas are fairs organised on religious occasions but also have secular aspects. The largest fair of the Mer region is the Madhavpur Mela. The Mer community annually celebrates 'Rukmini no Choro', at the beautiful Madhavrai Temple. It is believed in Madhavpur, Krishna married Rukmini. Mers also attend regional fairs such as the Maha Shivratri Mela in Bhavnath, Junagadh and the mela at the Bileshwar Mahadev Temple in the Barda Hills. On Bhim Agyaras other fairs are organised in Odadar and Visavada in the highland and Balej in the low-land. Mers go on pilgrimage to Dwarka. Another common pilgrimage is to Mount Girnar. Diaspora Mers started migrating to the British colonies in East Africa during early parts of 20th century. The businessman, Nanji Kalidas Mehta was instrumental in helping them to migrate to Africa. Many of the early migrants were from the highlands villages. Following the expulsion of Asians from Uganda many Mers settled in Britain.

They currently play their first team games at the Communal Stadium in Jette.  History   Foundation  The club was founded on 18 March 1986 under the name FC Bleid by passionate football fans Renato Di Felice, Joel and Thiry Marcel Thiry, Luc Windeshausen and Serge Carnevali, the former becoming the first club President. On 25 June the club affiliated to the Belgian FA, receiving the registration number 9026.  Entering the Third Division, and financial problems  Joining the third tier of Belgian football at the point when was expanding to 18 teams per division, Bleid struggled to raise their game to match the competition and for a long time occupied a place in the relegation zone, only escaping due to Racing Péruwelz being forced to forfeit eight games by the Belgian FA in punishment for fielding an ineligible player. The club managed to finish just one point above the also-relegated Tongeren. Adding to a poor season, on 9 March 2010 club officials were forced to concede that the club's financial position was dire and that they were contemplating filing for bankruptcy and winding up the club. Avoiding bankruptcy, the club changed the name to FC Bleid-Gaume in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. While the following season suffered none of the financial turbulence of the previous, still results on the pitch were little better as they finished 14th of 18 teams, just four points above the relegation play-offs. While for the 2011–12 the Bleid management were determined not to be content merely fighting for survival, instead their financial woes caught up with them once more, threatening the club's very existence. On 30 October 2011 the entire club board announced the impending bankruptcy of the club and resigned, intending the club to cease activities at the end of the calendar year. On 12 December, however, a take-over was completed by a consortium of French investors led by Gregory Sellier and Maxime Bootz. The new owners of the club advocated an ambitious future for the club, hiring World Cup winner Lionel Charbonnier as manager and announcing that their aim was to reach the Belgian Second Division within three years. The dreams of the new ownership group were quickly found to be pure fantasy when, despite enlisting the support of celebrities such as Francis Lalanne and M. Pokora as money-spinning crowd attractions the club failed to gain any more financial traction than it had had before the takeover, and once again the club was declared bankrupt, with the club's registration number being put on sale to any club who wished to purchase it and take Bleid-Gaume's place in the third division. After flirting with Promotion D club Wallonia Walhain, the registration number was instead purchased by bottom-tier club R. White Daring Molenbeek under the ownership of former Belgium international Michel De Wolf in an attempt at resurrecting the former glories of the one-time national champion club. Following the merger of the two clubs, the new club moved to Molenbeek. Though it officially kept the name FC Bleid-Gaume, it came to be referred to by the common name FC Bleid- Molenbeek in respect of the new Brussels location of the club. Despite the club's new start, however, on the pitch results once again took a turn for the worst, with the club finally succumbing to relegation back to the fourth-level Promotion league.  Kompany Era  In March 2013, Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany purchased his hometown club FC Bleid-Molenbeek. Kompany updated the website stating that he was holding a vote for a new name for the club, Kompany also added his sister to the backroom staff to oversee the running of the club. On 11 April 2013, the votes were received, – BX Brussels – is the new name for the club.

Under Roarty's advisement, Anheuser-Busch continued to support ESPN during the network's difficult early years. Roarty promoted these investments as a smart business decision by Anheuser-Busch, telling the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1994, \\"\\"We gave them $1 million that first year. And if we hadn't, they'd have gone under...I believed the beer drinker was a sports lover...The next year we gave them $5 million.

Following the coup, Al-Qaddafi was imprisoned by the Gadaffi regime. He was released four months later only to be rearrested in 1970 on charges of permitting King Idris to leave Libya and was imprisoned for a further two years. His time in prison affected his health considerably. In 1974 Al-Qaddafi suffered a heart attack but was refused permission to leave the country for treatment. In 1977, Al-Qaddafi's eldest son Majid, fled to United States following his involvement in the April 1976 demonstrations against the Gaddafi regime at Benghazi's Gar Younis university which saw hundreds of student demonstrators killed or imprisoned.'Libya: What Happened and When'publisher=Libya-Watanona.comurl=http://www.libya- watanona.com/libya/libyans.htm Identified as a key protester Majid Al A-Qaddafi found safe passage to the US and eventually settling in Portland, Oregon where he kept a low profile.

The violence was partly a Hindu-Muslim conflict, and partly a Muslim-Police conflict. It started when a group of Muslims pelted stones at the local police for their refusal to remove a pig from the local Idgah on 13 August. The police responded with indiscriminate firing, which led to over one hundred deaths. This was followed by a series of violent incidents which became religious in nature, and led to arson, looting and murders. The violent incidents continued until November 1980. The total death tally is uncertain: the government recognized and paid compensation for 400 deaths, while the unofficial estimates run as high as 2500. The riots greatly affected the city's noted brassware industry, which saw a sharp decline in the production and export figures.EPW correspondent Krishna Gandhi claimed that the \\"group of criminals supported by ML leaders\\" were responsible for the massacres. According to him, the firing occurred after Muslims beat up policemen, and the excesses committed by the police were, according to him, a reaction to Muslim attacks.  Background  Moradabad has a history of Hindu- Muslim riots; the first such riot occurred in 1848, followed by another one in 1872. In the 1880s, there were more Hindu voters in the city. However, the Muslim secretary of the Municipality always drew the electoral ward boundaries in such a way that Hindus were concentrated in one ward, while the Muslims had the majority in the remaining five wards. As a result, the Muslims always had the majority in the municipal body. Following protests by the Hindus, the ward boundaries were re-drawn and the Hindus gained majority in the municipality. Both the communities used their administrative power to assert their religious interests, leading to communal animosity. In the 1930s, the Muslim League, which demanded a separate country for Muslims, gained popularity in Moradabad. The local leader and lawyer Qazi Taslim Husain turned the Islamic Musafir Khana near the Moradabad railway station into a center for separatist politics in the city. The Hindu organizations Arya Samaj and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) organized akharas in the city, campaigning against the Muslims. Following the partition of India, widespread riots broke out in the city in January 1948. Again in 1978, Hindu-Muslim violence broke out in Sambhal (then part of the Moradabad district).  The trigger  The tensions between Hindus and Muslims had been running high since the kidnap of a Dalit girl by some Muslims in March 1980. The Dalits and Muslims used to live in separate bastis (colonies) near an Idgah. The girl was later rescued, and her kidnapper was arrested. In July, on the day of her marriage to a Dalit boy, some Muslims obstructed the marriage procession complaining about loud music near the mosque. The argument soon escalated into a violent clash between the two communities, followed by looting of several houses. On 13 August 1980, a domesticated pig from the Dalit colony strayed into the Idgah during the Id prayer. Around 50,000 Muslims were attending Eid Miladun Nabi prayers at the location. The Muslims, who considered the pigs as haraam, believed that the pig had been deliberately released by the Hindu Dalits. They asked an on-duty policeman to chase the pig away, but he refused to do so, leading to a heated argument. The violence broke out when some Muslims pelted stones at the policemen. The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) collapsed when a stone hit his forehead. The policemen then started firing indiscriminately into the crowd. The police force was reinforced by the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) troops that arrived in trucks along with the District Magistrate. Several Muslims were killed in the firing; about 50 more lost their lives in a stampede that followed the firing. The Muslim leader Syed Shahabuddin later compared the firing to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.  The riots  The surviving Muslim crowd at the Idgah soon turned into a mob and beat up the policemen in different localities of the city. They burnt a PAC constable to death. In the evening, a Muslim mob attacked the Galshaheed police chowki (outpost), setting it on fire, killing two policemen and looting the arms. This was followed by violent reprisals by the police. On the next day, 14 August, the Jamaat-e-Islami organized a gathering of the Muslim leaders from the various political parties, and issued a statement condemning the riots. Multiple Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders started holding public meetings sowing communal discord in the upper-caste Hindu community. They organized akharas in the city, campaigning against the Muslims. This resulted in the violence acquired a religious nature and spread to the rural areas of the Moradabad district. The violence also spread to the neighbouring city of Aligarh. The army troops were posted in the region to control the violence. By 2 September, the situation in Moradabad was brought under control, and the army started withdrawing. The violence continued on a smaller scale until November 1980. A major incidence of violence occurred in September, on the day of the Hindu festival Raksha Bandhan. At the end of October, a series of stabbings and killings resulted in at least 14 deaths.  Aftermath  The riots happened during the chief ministership of the Congress leader V. P. Singh. The Union Minister Yogendra Makwana blamed the violence on the RSS, Jan Sangh and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Prime Minister Indira Gandhi suggested that \\"foreign forces\\" (referring to Pakistan) and \\"communal parties\\" were behind the violence. The Times of India editor Girilal Jain stated that the \\"anti-social elements\\" among the Muslims were partly responsible for the violence, and criticized the Muslim leaders for not admitting to the facts and instead blaming the RSS. He also gave credence to Indira Gandhi's \\"foreign hand\\" theory, and published an article listing the number of Pakistani visitors to Uttar Pradesh. The BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani blamed the Muslim organizations for the violence. The government appointed Justice Saxena of the Allahabad High Court to investigate the riots. The Justice Saxena report, submitted in May 1983, indicted Muslim leaders and V. P. Singh for the violence.

The office lapsed in the 1880s, but was briefly revived in the twentieth century. It was abolished on the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. The office was created in 1831 to ease the heavy workload of the existing Irish Law Officers, the Attorney General for Ireland and the Solicitor General for Ireland.Casey, James The Irish Law Officers Round Hall Sweet and Maxwell 1996 p.47 Role of the Law Adviser No specific duties were assigned to the Law Adviser when the office was created: he appears at first to have acted as a general assistant to the senior Law Officers. Later he was given the tasks of drafting Parliamentary Bills, and of advising lay magistrates on any legal problems which they referred to him.Casey p.48 Cases involving State security also fell under his remit: Denis Caulfield Heron, the Law Adviser in 1867, was heavily occupied in prosecuting the trials which followed the Fenian Rising.Obituary for Denis Caulfield Heron in the Downside Review (1881) At first the Law Adviser was usually also one of the Serjeants-at-law, but in time the position was opened up to rising junior barristers, many of whom hoped in due course to be appointed to the Bench; later it seems to have been thought that the offices of Serjeant and Law Adviser should be separate. There may also have been a feeling that some of the work of the Law Adviser was beneath the dignity of a holder of the ancient and prestigious office of Serjeant. The Attorney General normally had the final word in the appointment of the Law Adviser: certainly this was so in 1841 when Francis Blackburne insisted on the appointment of Abraham Brewster, despite strong opposition from Daniel O'Connell, who disliked Brewster. Blackburne said that he would not tolerate a refusal to ratify the appointment, an interesting glimpse of the influence he wielded in the Dublin administration at the time.Delaney, V.T.H Christopher Palles Allen Figgis and Co Dublin 1960 p.60 The Law Adviser's function of advising magistrates on points of law was open to serious criticism as an interference by the Crown with the independence of the judiciary. In particular John Naish, the last nineteenth-century Law Adviser, was attacked by his political opponents for assisting magistrates in their ongoing struggle with the Irish National Land League. He was also criticised for suggesting that they should use an obscure medieval statute, 34 Edward III c.1, to imprison those who could not find surety for their good behaviour. Since the statute had clearly been intended only to deal with cases of riot, this was a notable misreading of the law. Abolition of the Office  Perhaps because of the controversy over Naish's advice on the Land League, the office was left vacant after his promotion to the office of Solicitor General in 1883. It was briefly revived in 1919, but lapsed a year later, and was finally abolished by the Irish Free State in 1924.Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 s.6 Sketch of Charles Robert Barry, Law Adviser 1865-1866 List of Law Advisers 1831-1883,1919-1920 incomplete *1831 Richard Wilson GreeneBall, F.

Jagad X Code was set in a village alongside Code Stream in Yogyakarta, which had received support from Y. B. Mangunwijaya but was forced to be self-sufficient after Mangunwijaya's death. It followed three youths from the village who, unable to buy the things they want owing to omnipresent poverty, agree to find a flash drive for a local thug. In 2011 Novianto's television film Papi, Mami, dan Tukang Kebun (Father, Mother, and the Gardener) won twelve prizes at the FTV Awards in Jakarta, including Best Director. Novianto's second feature film, Tanah Surga... Katanya, was released in 2012. He won the Citra Award for Best Director for the film, being selected over more established directors such as Hanung Bramantyo and Teddy Soeriaatmadja; the film itself was selected as Best Film. Novianto described it as a surprise, but suggested he was burdened by the prize because he would be pressured to produce better work the following year.

It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman.ASCAP Database Music Search - Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman songs Within the show's universe, it was written by songwriting team Jimmy Collins (Jeremy Jordan) and Kyle Bishop (Andy Mientus) for their musical Hit List. In the episode, Broadway star Veronica Moore (Jennifer Hudson) is rehearsing for a one night only concert with the help of Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) and struggling to figure out the direction that it should take. Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) learns that they are looking for some songs for the show and call Jimmy and Kyle to see if they have a song that can be used and help them get a foot in the door. They come over and try to pitch some of their songs to Tom, who tells them their songs are good, but none of them are right for Veronica's style. Kyle suggests that they'll write a song, even though they only have a few hours to do so. Kyle and Jimmy struggle over the next few hours to come up with a song that's right for Veronica and the show. They eventually finish, but Derek refuses to hear it because Veronica and her mother aren't comfortable with Derek's more sexed-up direction and want to do the songs she usually does. Jimmy storms off and gets high, but Karen convinces him to come back and show that he's got thick enough skin to handle rejection. Meanwhile, Tom has looked at the song and determines that it is really good, and gives it to Derek and convinces him to use it. At the end of the concert, Veronica introduces the song to the audience and sings it, with Jimmy and Kyle watching from backstage and finding out for the first time that their song really is being used. Veronica's performance gets a standing ovation, and she motions to Jimmy and Kyle to come out on stage and she introduces them to the audience (which is also being filmed by the Bravo network), introducing them and their music to a wider audience than they've ever had before.

First established in 1925 as a private residence for Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh I (who had been returning from almost three decades of exile), the Museum currently provides fair insight into the culture of Ashantiland and Ghana's cultural legacy from before its colonization by Great Britain. It primarily serves \\"to commemorate (the Ashanti people's) own kings, queens and leaders and to communicate the riches of their history and culture to future generations\\". and generally features video presentations and key historical items pertaining to Ashantiland and Ghana's ancestry. It was rehabilitated in 1995 at about 12,000 cedis and subsequently reopened to the public on August 12 of that year by Otumfuo Opoku Ware II, the 15th King as part of his Silver Jubilee celebration.

It is also found in Japan and Korea. This species was first described in 1865, its name was verified by AAS Systematic Botanists on October 2, 2015. The plant is dioecious. The young shoots are red-coloured. The larvae of the moth Deoptilia heptadeta mine the leaves to feed.  Uses  The large leaves were used to wrap food. The young leaves, when boiled, are edible. The bark is used in the Japanese pharmacopoeia as a decoction against gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric hyperacidity. In addition, the fruit has anthelmintic properties.  Ecology  Mallotus japonicus shows physical, chemical, and biotic resistance traits against herbivores. Trichomes, which are produced on leaf surfaces, serve as a physical resistance trait. Pellucid dots, which also are present on leaf surfaces, typically contain toxic metabolic substances or essential oils and function as a chemical resistance trait. Furthermore, the plant bears extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) on its leaf edges and food bodies (pearl bodies) on its leaf and stem surfaces as biotic resistance traits. EFNs contain primary sugars, and food bodies are known as lipid-rich particles. These biotic traits attract ants, which remove herbivores from the plant. The plant can change its combination of defence traits in response to leaf age and abiotic habitat conditions,.  Chemistry  Mallotus japonicus contains bergenin. The pericarp contains mallotophenone, mallotochromeneStudies on Cytotoxic Constituents in Pericarps of Mallotus japonicus, Part I.

The bark contains 11-O-galloylbergenin, 4-O-galloylbergenin and 11-O-galloyldemethylbergenin. The bark also contains the hydrolyzable tannins 1,2-di-O-galloyl-3,6-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-beta-D- glucose, 1-O-digalloyl-3,6-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-beta-D-glucose, 1-O-galloyl-2,4-elaeocarpusinoyl-3,6-(R)-valoneayl-beta-D-glucose (mallojaponin) and 1-O-galloyl-2,4-elaeocarpusinoyl-beta-D-glucose (mallonin) and mallotusinin.
