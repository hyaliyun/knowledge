She was also the editor of The Contemporary Review for almost twenty years. Biography Born on 11 September 1909, Rosalind Herschel Wade was the daughter of an army officer. She was educated in London, finishing at Bedford College. Wade married banker William Kean Seymour (who was also a writer); they had two sons, one of whom is the thriller writer Gerald Seymour. Beginning at the age of 22, Wade published some two dozen novels and many short stories. Wade used her full birth name of Rosalind Herschel Wade for some of her early works but Rosalind Wade for the bulk of her writing and Catharine Carr for a couple of books. Her novels are noted for their sometimes bleak examination of characters' emotional lives and troubles such as alcoholism. Morning Break (1956), for example, centres on a pair of schoolteachers in an English industrial town and the difficulties they encounter, ranging from student vandalism to infidelity. Treasure in Heaven (1937) is about a busy single woman who, at the age of 50, realizes she has been repressing her 'natural' desires and has thus missed out on crucial elements of a full life such as marriage and children. Children, Be Happy! (published by Gollancz in 1931 to good reviews) became the centre of a minor literary furore just before it was to be republished in America by Farrar & Rinehart. The story was set in a girls' school, and apparently Wade based some of her characters on real people, because several women brought lawsuits and won damages from Gollancz. In one case, revolving on the fact that a minor character who lost her virginity outside marriage was based on an identifiable real woman, the plaintiff won more than just monetary damages.

The unit consisted of Iranian noblemen who were originally part of the aswaran unit of the Sasanian army. It was disbanded in 703 by al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf.  Etymology  The word is the Arabic broken plural form of the Middle Persian word aswƒÅr (\\"horseman\\"), which in turn is from the Old Persian word asabƒÅra. The Parthian form is asbƒÅr.  Background  During the Arab invasion of Iran, the Sasanian king Yazdegerd III (r. 632‚Äì651) sent 1,000 cavalrymen under Siyah al-Uswari to defend Khuzestan. These 1,000 men were of ethnic Iranians from Isfahan and region between Isfahan and Khuzestan, and served in the aswaran unit. During the siege of Shushtar (641‚Äì642), they defected to the Arabs, and settled in Basra, where they received salary. Furthermore, they also converted to Islam and allied themselves with the Banu Tamim of southern Iraq.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/asawera-arabic-broken-plural-form- the-variant-asawirat-also-occurs-in-yaqubi-p However, the story about them converting to Islam is most likely inaccurate, since 15 years later, some members still appear with Zoroastrian names, such as a certain Mah-Afridhan.  History  They thereafter participated in the conquest of Pars, Kerman, and Khorasan. After the fall of the Rashidun Caliphate in 661, they continued serving under their successors, the Umayyad Caliphate. One year later, the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I (661‚Äì680) resettled some of the Asawira in Antioch. According to Ibn al-Faqih, the Umayyad governor Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan had a mosque constructed in Basra for them in the late 660s. During the Second Fitna, the Asawira helped the Tamim tribe in the killing of the governor of Basra, Mas'ud ibn Amr (d. 684). The Asawira later joined the rebellion of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath, which lasted from 700 to 703. However, this made the Arab statesman al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf disband the Asawira, by destroying their homes, reducing their salary, and resettling them to other cities. Some of their descendants are later mentioned in some sources, such as Musa ibn Sayyar al-Uswari, who was the student of Hasan of Basra, a prominent Muslim scholar, who was also of Iranian origin.

After the elections to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania in May 1920, Varonka was replaced by more pro-Lithuanian Dominik Semashko as the minister. Varonka edited numerous Belarusian and Russian language newspapers, wrote many political and historical essays, actively participated in Belarusian cultural life. In 1923, he emigrated to Chicago, United States and began publishing the first Belarusian newspaper in the United States, Beloruskaia Tribuna (1926). Varonka started a weekly radio program in Chicago in Belarusian and Russian in the late twenties. After World War II became one of the founders of the Belarusan-American Association. He died in Chicago on 4 June 1952 and was buried at Elmwood Cemetery (River Grove, Illinois).–ó–Ω–æ–π–¥–∑–µ–Ω–∞—è –º–∞–≥—ñ–ª–∞ –∫—ñ—Ä–∞—û–Ω—ñ–∫–∞ —û—Ä–∞–¥–∞ –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫–∞–π –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞–π –†—ç—Å–ø—É–±–ª—ñ–∫—ñ –Ø–∑—ç–ø–∞ –í–∞—Ä–æ–Ω–∫—ñ  References  Category:1891 births Category:1952 deaths Category:People from Sok√≥≈Çka County Category:People from Sokolsky Uyezd Category:Prime Ministers of Belarus Category:Government ministers of Lithuania Category:Members of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic Category:Members of the Council of Lithuania Category:Belarusian journalists Category:Belarusian emigrants to the United States Category:Saint Petersburg State University alumni Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Jazep Varonka"},{"id":"49160544","text":"Evan Coolidge was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly.

Later, like much of the nearby Dartford Heath, the site was extensively quarried (notably for sand), until it was finally infilled and abandoned in the 1980s; after which time it gradually reverted to nature.

There is also a pond, and many common bird species. Reptiles catalogued here include the grass snake, common lizard and slow-worm. There is access to the reserve from Lower Station Road and Galloway Drive, Crayford. A large housing development called Braeburn Park was built here by Taylor Wimpey in 2000.

Akhavan's family immigrated to Canada during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. His work has gained international acclaim, exhibiting in museums, galleries and biennales all over North America, Europe and the Middle East. He is the recipient of the Kunstpreis Berlin (2012), the Abraaj Group Art Prize (2014), and the Sobey Art Award (2015).  Career  Domestic spaces, as negotiated between hospitality and hostility, have been an ongoing area of research in Akhavan's practice. His works are created in direct response to the situation he finds himself working in, whether that might be a specific structure, institution, geographic region, or community. His recent work has moved past the confines of home to the surrounding areas, including an examination of domesticated landscapes. Akhavan has exhibited work at the Western Front in Vancouver, the Delfina Foundation in London, the Bergen Museum in Norway, and ABC Art Berlin Contemporary.

Known as the \\"Amazon for liquor,\\" Drizly lets users order a variety of beer, wine, and spirits directly from local retailers to their location through a mobile app or website. History Drizly was founded by Nick Rellas, Justin Robinson, and Spencer Frazier and Brett Beller in 2012. The company launched its service in the greater Boston area in 2013, then expanded to New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Drizly, which currently employs about 85 people in its Boston, New York, and Denver offices, is available in many U.S. Markets, and as of February 2016, has expanded to Edmonton and Calgary, Alberta, Canada through a partnership with Liquor Stores N.A. (LSNA). As of January 2017, total venture capital funding for Drizly was about $35 million. Series A/B investors include Polaris Partners, Suffolk Equity Partners, Cava Capital, Fairhaven Capital Partners, and First Beverage Group. Angel investors include Walt Doyle, Lars Albright, Ty Danco, Fred Shilmover and Streetwise Media co-founder Chase Garbarino. In July 2018, Drizly entered into a partnership with Anheuser-Busch to keep beer stocked in offices across the country. The partnership allows exclusive handling delivery to Anheuser-Busch's Office Bud-e fridges, which use smart sensors and WiFi connection to automatically re-order beer when stocks run low. Description Drizly partners with local retailers to bring their inventory to customers. The service is mainly provided through a smartphone app, available on iOS and Android platforms, apart from its website. Users place their order through the Drizly app or website. Drizly retail partners fulfill the order, process the transaction, and execute delivery. Delivery generally takes 30‚Äì60 minutes. There are separate apps for both customers and delivery drivers. Drizly has proprietary ID verification technology that it provides to its retail partners that allows drivers to scan IDs for more than a barcode to make sure the purchaser is over 21 years old in the US and of legal drinking age in Canada. Drizly does not take a cut of the orders, which is one reason why New York State Liquor Authority approved it to operate without a liquor license. Instead, Drizly charges the liquor and wine stores a monthly fee to use its order fulfillment software as well as its iPads and iPhones. Drizly does not mark up the prices of alcoholic beverages themselves. Retailers on Drizly may have a minimum order or delivery fee, typically $5. In each of its cities, Drizly partners with local retailers. Its retail partners pay a licensing fee to be able to use its website and apps for iPhone and Android devices. Drizly is partnered with the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America. Data breach On July 28, 2020, Drizly announced it had been the victim of a data breach exposing sensitive information on approximately 2.5 million customer accounts, including dates of birth, email addresses, and bcrypt-hashed passwords, along with delivery addresses in rare cases.

Slate was born in Tangent, Oregon, to Nathaniel Porter Slate and Alice Slate. Thomas Slate @ geni.com; accessed January 19, 2016and raised in Alsea, Oregon. He showed an early aptitude for inventing and adapting materials and processes. Dry ice Slate made his largest fortune as the developer of dry ice, working on the East Coast. In 1924 he applied for a US patent to sell dry ice commercially. He became the first to make dry ice successful as an industry. In 1925, this solid form of CO2 was trademarked by the DryIce Corporation of America as \\"Dry ice\\", thus leading to its common name. The DryIce Company began marketing \\"dry ice\\" in 1925, for use in deep refrigeration. Lighter-than-airships In 1925 Slate sold his business and relocated to Glendale, California, where he began touting a revolutionary concept. Lighter-than-air transport was in vogue, but airships were hampered by the inherent weakness of fabric-skin construction and leaky gasbags. Slate proposed fabricating the hull of 0.011-inch thick duralumin, which would be light enough to be viable, but strong enough and fireproof in order to use the more-readily-available hydrogen gas rather than helium. Slate secured a section of land adjacent to Glendale's Grand Central Airport, large enough to construct a colossal hangar. Interior and exterior views of the Slate Dirigible Company hangar at Grand Central Airport, Glendale CA He sold shares of stock in his new company, and as thanks for the support he received, he christened his airship City of Glendale. Not content with merely revolutionizing the art of dirigible fabrication, Slate also proposed a non- traditional motive force. Steam from a flash boiler in the cabin would drive a nose-mounted blower at 6,000 revolutions/minute; the paddle-shaped blades would throw the air (ahead of the bow) outward, creating a low-pressure area into which the large dirigible body would be pushed (by the ambient atmospheric pressure on its rear surfaces). His \\"air displacement system\\" was predicted to propel the airship at 100 miles/hour (160 km/hr). To boost thrust, he added an engine-driven pusher propeller at the rear. Still more innovation was proposed: Slate's concept of \\"sustained flight\\" meant the airship would not need large mooring stations at its proposed destinations and enroute stops. Instead, passengers would be raised or lowered via a combination of anchor and elevator. A fuel tank, lowered by cable, served as the anchor; a capsule-like elevator would descend along the cable while the airship idled overhead. Slate portrayed his airship as being able to pluck patrons from decks of ocean liners, and roofs of luxury hotels, bypassing the need to travel to airports or other depots. The airship was constructed at Glendale, and first brought outside on January 6, 1929. With a crowd watching, Slate's handlers released its restraining cables until the shiny unit rose to thirty feet above the concrete. The initial public appearance was an unmitigated success. However, problems with the steam-production equipment delayed flight testing until December, when Slate gave up on that system and installed an internal-combustion engine (a Wright Whirlwind) driving a conventional propeller to move the craft. On December 17 the airship was moved outdoors, into an unseasonably hot sunny afternoon. Soon, the expanding hydrogen within the metal body raised the internal pressure to the point that it popped the emergency relief valves. The unit was moved back inside. On December 19 the airship was moved outdoors again, with its engines running and propellers spinning as it was guided through the doors. Handlers positioned themselves and the unit for launching, but within five minutes the sun had again heated the internal gas. A staccato pop of rivets was followed by a metallic-sounding explosion and a vapor cloud as the gas escaped. The port side had failed; the side was distended, the duralumin ribs bulging and honeycombed with gaps. The unit was dragged into the hangar, where an engineering assessment determined it was not repairable. Since the country was slipping into The Great Depression, no financing could be found to fund repairs, so the structure was sold for scrap ($0.60 per pound), the employees were discharged, and the Slate Dirigible Corporation was dissolved.Air & Space/Smithsonian, October/November 1997, p. 22 Glendale Rising (Stephen Joiner) Other ventures In the mid-1950s, Slate was again in the California news, with a proposal to clear vital valley areas of the then-pervasive smog. His proposal to install \\"cyclone-producing devices\\" atop the mountains surrounding the valleys attracted some interest in the press, but no firm offers were received, and he dropped the idea. Slate eventually returned to Oregon, where he lived a long life, a few days short of a century. He died in Corvallis, Oregon, on November 26, 1980.

Not only did Watermark seek to discipline the husband, it contacted organizations with whom the woman (with whom the husband was having the affair) was involved, encouraging them to intervene, even though she was never a Watermark member. =Pursuing Authenticity= The online blog No Eden Elsewhere reported that at least two former members notified the blog of their experiences. Going by the pseudonyms \\"Susan\\" and \\"Michael\\", the members told that they were encouraged into revealing their financial and personal history to the \\"community group\\" of which they were members, and were admonished when neither shared anything that could be used to \\"control\\" them. Both members compared Watermark's actions to the Scientology cult, due to the need to know personal details of members. In a third post from this site, two parents relayed experiences whereby, after their adult children joined Watermark and went through its Re:Generation ministry https://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery, those children then claimed to have been \\"abused\\" by the parents and now no longer want a relationship with them. One parent even agreed to a \\"reconciliation\\" process approved by her child's community group, which failed.http://noedenelsewhere.com/family-ties/ The post mentions a third instance, one of the comments on the video was from a mother attempting reconciliation with her son (a Watermark member), and was told that Watermark will not work with her directly, but required her to engage a \\"spiritual authority\\" from her congregation to discuss the matter with a \\"spiritual authority\\" from Watermark (even though the woman was not told what actions she had done to cause the rift in the first place).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grCL8oHcXm0&feature;=youtu.be References Category:Churches in Texas Category:Churches in Dallas ","title":"Watermark Community Church"},{"id":"49160762","text":"Mary Malahlela-Xakana (2 May 1916 ‚Äì 8 May 1981)Birth and death dates from \\"Dr Mary Susan Makobatjatji Malahlela (Posthumous)\\" , Order of the Baobab, Office of the Presidency, Government of South Africa; some sources give 1917 and 1982 instead. was the first black woman to register as a medical doctor in South Africa (in 1947).

Oscar Schmidt- International, Inc. manufactured the Guitaro in the mid-1960s through the early 70s to take advantage of the guitar's popularity in the folk music revival of that era. (See Guitaro's US Patent #3,237,503, filed with the USPTO on June 17, 1963 and issued March 1, 1966.) Other sellers commonly sold it under their own brand names but most or all resellers still called it Guitaro. The Guitaro design allows use of a shoulder strap, much like a guitar. Note that finger picks are used by this player. Due to Guitaro's long body, its 24 strings are necessarily longer than the 36 strings found on Oscar Schmidt- International's chromatic autoharps. Guitaro's resulting lower tones render it suitable for accompaniment, although playing melody with the help of its 15 chord bars may also be possible. Like the autoharp, either finger picks or a flat pick may be used to play Guitaro. Sara Carter played Guitaro in some performances; online videos show her playing one. In 1964, Guitaro was introduced by Oscar Schmidt-International, Inc., along with the book \\"Make Wonderful Music with the Guitaro\\" (registered by the US Copyright Office on June 10, 1964). Designed by Glen Peterson and Henry Ruckner, Guitaro came in two models. The first, model #55, sports a resonator with a soundhole in back. Model #55B, having a soundhole in front without a resonator, continued to be manufactured after #55 was discontinued in the early 1970s. [U.S. Patent #3,237,503. Issued March 1, 1966].

The five piece band is known for its mixture of classic, power, and modern progressive metal combining strong vocals, complex instrumentation, and an expansive fantasy backstory to create energetic live shows. The band appears on-stage in armor and costumes. Lords of the Trident have played and toured with many high-profile acts, including Steel Panther, Psychostick, Helloween, Battle Beast, Thor, Marty Friedman, Cage, Unleash the Archers, 3 Inches of Blood, Skeletonwitch, Crimson Shadows, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Puddle of Mudd, Mushroomhead, Saliva, Fuel, A Sound of Thunder, BattleBeast and Of Montreal.  History = Formation, Full-length CD Death or Sandwich (2005 - 2009) = Lords of the Trident was formed by members Fang VonWrathenstein (Ty Christian), Asian Metal (Akira Shimada), and Socrates of Shred (Brian Cole) in 2005. The band began as a recording project and grew into a live lineup in early 2008 as Ty Christian's previous musical project was disbanding. Bassist Captain Bluddbeard (Mike Charlton) and Danalog (Dan Metzger) were auditioned and joined the band. After the first few months of performing live, the band decided to replace Danalog with a new drummer - Korgoth (Corey Larson). Shortly after, the band released their first full- length CD, Death or Sandwich, on February 13, 2009. The CD was self-released by the band's label, Junko Johnson Records. A few months after the release of Death or Sandwich Socrates left the band and was replaced by new guitarist Killius Maximus (Elliot Ignasiak) . = Chains on Fire (2010 - 2012) = Before the band returned to the studio to record what was to be their second full-length CD, Chains on Fire, Captain Bluddbeard left the band due to personal and musical differences and was replaced by bassist Pontifex Mortis (Brent Clark). The band continued to tour regionally, and appeared at the Warriors of Metal III Fest in Ohio. On January 28, 2011, the band released Chains on Fire at a concert in Madison, Wisconsin which was filmed and became the accompanying DVD: Lords of the Trident - Chains on Fire Release Party 2011. In October 2011, Korgoth left the band and was replaced by the new drummer Sledge Garrotte (Wade Schultz). In May 2012, Lords of the Trident won a tri-state Battle of the Bands contest sponsored by Madison Media Institute, and was introduced to Martin Atkins and Doug Olson. The pair would become producers for the band's next release. = Plan of Attack, A Very Lords of the Trident Christmas EPs (2013 - 2015) = Under the guidance of Doug Olson (producer for Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, and Cheap Trick), the band quickly recorded and mixed their next release, 2013's Plan of Attack, at the Madison Media Institute studios. Additionally, the band launched a Kickstarter campaign for the album, which raised $2,508 - a little more than three times their goal of $700. Plan of Attack was released on January 6, 2013. The band toured to support the release in the summer of 2013. In December 2013, the band released the EP A Very Lords of the Trident Christmas, which contained a collection of Christmas singles recorded for the Madison-area Christmas Compilations(MAXMas) of 2010 - 2012. In October 2013, the band replaced drummer Sledge Garrotte with new drummer Dr. Dante Vitus (Joe Scarpelli III). In the summer of 2014, the band embarked on their second US tour, playing the Warriors of Metal VII Fest as one of the stops. This was also the first year the band appeared at Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In October 2014, the City of Madison Arts Commission chose Lords of the Trident to represent the city at the BandSwap festival in Fort Collins, Colorado. = Frostburn, re:Quests (2015 - 2016) = The band returned to producer Doug Olson for their third full-length album, Frostburn. Recording the majority of the album in late 2014, the band launched another Kickstarter campaign which raised $5,824 - almost double their goal of $3,000. In late 2014, the band was signed to the German record label Killer Metal Records. Frostburn was released on February 13, 2015, and became the band's best-reviewed release to date. In early 2015, Killius announced that he was leaving the band to enroll in medical school. Shortly thereafter, the lead guitar position was offered to Baron Taurean Helleshaar (Brian Koenig, formerly of Luna Mortis). On Christmas Day 2015, the band released re:Quests, an EP of cover songs suggested by Kickstarter donors. In early 2016, the band announced their first international tour, scheduled for a string of Canadian shows in summer 2016. In late 2016, Dr. Dante Vitus announced his departure from the band due to enrolling in medical school. The band announced a new drummer had been found in December 2016. = Mad With Power Fest (2017) = Dr. Vitus left the band amicably in January 2017, and was replaced by Master Hercule ‚ÄúHerc‚Äù Schlagzeuger (Brett Walter) immediately thereafter. Around this time, Brian Koenig signed an agreement to produce a series of how-to shred guitar lessons for Guitar World, and released them throughout the year. During 2017, the band continued work on their next album, balancing this with multiple tour dates. Foremost was the inaugural Mad With Power Fest, a power metal festival in Madison, WI organized and run by the band. The first Mad With Power Fest was a solid success, with five bands performing and attendance breaking expectations. At the festival, the Lords of the Trident debuted their own branded Mad With Power Mead, created by Bos Meadery, and other bands released their own branded beers. = Mad With Power Fest II, Shadows of the Past (2018) = The band announced in late 2017 that a Mad With Power Fest II was in the works, featuring several notable bands including the Lords of the Trident, Zephaniah and Green Death. In March 2018 they finished recording their fourth album, Shadows of the Past, that was released on August 25, 2018. Notable collaborations on the album include Brittney Slayes from Unleash the Archers, a professional chorus, full orchestra, and a small fan group recorded in Ty's basement studio. Tours for the year included North Carolina, Canada, and the upper Midwest. The band continued to produce a large amount of non-musical content, largely for paying fans via their Patreon website. Over the course of 2018, the band produced seven music videos for songs off of Shadows from the Past, as well as a playable music video game for the Sega CD video game system. = Pull the Plug, Mad With Power Fest III, European Tour (2019) = On January 11, 2019 the band released their fifth full-length album, Pull The Plug. This album is composed of acoustic songs released solely to their Patreon backers as a monthly subscriber benefit. Shortly thereafter, the band announced the lineup for the third year of their annual Mad With Power Fest, featuring Theocracy as the headliner. 2019's Mad With Power Fest was the band's first independently- run sold out festival, and dates for next year (as well as some of the bands already booked for 2020) were announced on-stage by singer Ty Christian. Shortly after Mad With Power Fest, the band embarked on their first headlining tour of Europe, visiting Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, and the Czech Republic. The band announced via their Patreon page that work had begun on the next full-length album, with a planned release date of late 2020.

Web. 14 Mar. 2016.  Early life and education  Lubi≈Ñska was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1904 and married Jerzy Konorski, a collaborator and fellow neuroscientist. Lubi≈Ñska entered the University of Warsaw to study biology in 1923, but a year later she transferred to the University of Paris, Sorbonne to continue her study of biological sciences. In 1927, Lubi≈Ñska she received her B.A. in biological chemistry and physiology, and her doctorate in 1932. While working on her doctorate, she worked in Louis and Marcelle Lapicque's Laboratory of Physiology, investigating chronaxie and reflexes. Her doctoral thesis focused on noniterative reflex, and she ultimately received a prize for her thesis from the Academy of Paris.  Career and research  After finishing her doctorate in Paris, Lubi≈Ñska began her independent research on the effect of different agents on excitability of neuromuscular preparation and took part in experiments of Jerzy Konorski and Stefan Miller on conditioned reflexes at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology in Warsaw. When World War II broke out between 1939 and 1940, she was forced to flee as the institute was destroyed by bombardment. Lubi≈Ñska and Konorski tried desperately to cross the northern border to eventually join Konorski's brother in England; however, the tight German control caused them to remain in Bia≈Çystok. Soon, Axis powers occupied the entire eastern part of Poland, including Bia≈Çystok, forcing the pair to flee to the Caucasus. There, she and her husband collaborated on peripheral nerve regeneration at the Georgian Institute of Experimental Medicine in Sukhumi from 1940-1945. After the war, Lubi≈Ñska's research continued in the realm of the peripheral nervous system. From 1945 to her retirement in 1982, she studied neural structure and physiology, especially axoplasmic transport, and showed that axoplasmic transport could be bidirectional.\\"Axoplasmic streaming in regenerating and in normal nerve fibres\\" (1964 Progress in Brain Research Vol. 13). In collaboration with Giuseppe Moruzzi and Horace Winchell Magoun, they established that the brain stem contains neurons that condition the brain center's awareness and posture and gave the conscious state control of the physical foundation, which led to the discovery such a system is active during waking and dreaming.Hobson, J. Allan. The Dreaming Brain. New York: Basic, 1988. Such contributions by Lubi≈Ñska led to a further understanding and discoveries in the neuroscience field. Over her career, she published approximately 80 papers and was widely acclaimed as being at the cutting edge of her field.

Biography  Siyah was a native of Spahan or Khuzestan. During the Arab invasion of Iran, the Sasanian king Yazdegerd III (r. 632‚Äì651) sent 300 men under Siyah al-Uswari to defend Khuzestan. However, during the siege of Shushtar (641-642), Siyah and his men defected to the Arabs. The reason for their defection was in order to preserve their status and wealth. However, according to the Khuzestan Chronicle, Siyah and his men first defected to the Arabs after they entered Shushtar. They thereafter settled in Basra, where they received salary. Furthermore, they also converted to Islam and allied themselves with the Banu Tamim of southern Iraq. However, the story about them converting to Islam is most likely inaccurate, since 15 years later, some members still appear with pure Zoroastrian Middle Persian names, such as a certain Mah Afridhan. Siyah is thereafter no longer mentioned; his son Yazid ibn Siyah al-Uswari continued the family's service in the Asawira.

Emma Costantino described the production as a \\"troubled shoot\\", stating that Ferruccio Casapinta's assistant director was the person who \\"did everything on set\\" and that Casapinta \\"was an idiot who couldn't do anything.\\" La bambola di Satana was filmed at Castle Borghese in Pomezia, Pratica di Mare and in Abruzzo. Release La bambola di Satana was released in Italy on June 12, 1969 where it was distributed by Cinediorama. It grossed a total of 118,009,000 Italian lire on its theatrical release. The film was never dubbed into English and did not receive a theatrical release in the United States. =Critical reception= Roberto Curti, author of Italian Gothic Horror Films, 1957‚Äì1969 stated that Ferruccio Casapinta \\"shows no directorial flair at all.\\" and that for a gothic film, it \\"looks awful.\\" The review noted that editing was poor, with night and day shots alternating within the same scene and that the special effects were terrible noting the thunderstorms and pink clouds that surround the castle. Curti concluded that the film was an \\"obscure‚Äî and deservedly so‚Äî addition to the Gothic genre\\" Louis Paul, author of Italian Horror Film Directors stated that the film is\\"certainly rooted within the classic gothic atmosphere of early Italian horrors, but the addition of considerable nudity and a black- gloved killer clearly places La bambola at the cusp of the new age. It is an indication of the changing aspects of the Italian horror film to come.\\" AllMovie gave the film a three and a half star out of five rating, finding that the film \\"benefits from a slicker look and a better sense of humor.\\" and that \\"It all seems a bit overwrought, but fans of Italian horror don't come to it for subtlety. Indeed, the nearly operatic histrionics on display are immensely enjoyable, for their camp value if nothing else.\\" =Home media= In 2016, Twilight Time released the film for the first time on Blu-ray.

It was built in the 1880s. It is also known as Japanese Consulate. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Kardinia, a decorative, single- storeyed timber residence, was erected during the boom years of the 1880s. John Graham MacDonald, 1865 The site was first purchased in April 1883 by Arthur Walters, and sold by November that year to Edward Bevan, a surveyor then in partnership with Christian Waagepetersen as Waagepetersen and Bevan, architects, surveyors and agents, Townsville. By 1883 Bevan was also editor of the Daily Northern Standard, a Townsville publication, and became well known as an artist and writer. It is not known whether Walters or Bevan erected a house on the site, but physical evidence suggests that the original building comprised just 2 rooms with a surrounding verandah, and was enlarged subsequently to create the present form. Bevan was resident on Stanton Hill by 16 June 1884, when his son Guy Felix was born, and in September 1886 took out a mortgage on the property, which may have financed the renovations. Title to the property was transferred in August 1888 to John Graham MacDonald, explorer, pastoralist, and police magistrate of Townsville from May 1888 to April 1899. In August 1889, Macdonald also took out a mortgage of on the property, but whether it was he, or Bevan, who commissioned the renovations, has not been established. Photographic evidence suggests that the house was enlarged, and had acquired its unusual asymmetrical facade, by . Macdonald was one of the first Europeans to explore the area between Bowen and the Gulf of Carpentaria, and later invested in northern pastoral properties such as Carpentaria Downs, in partnership with Robert Towns and Sir John Robertson. After the pastoral slump of the mid-1880s, Macdonald took up the important position of police magistrate in Townsville, and played a significant role in the life of the town. Macdonald resided at Kardinia from until , and from 1896 to 1908 leased the house to the Japanese Government as Australia's first Japanese consulate, servicing the needs of the growing number of Japanese living in North Queensland, and promoting improved trade relations between Australia and Japan. After the consulate moved to Sydney in 1908 the house was occupied by prominent Townsville businessman, alderman, mayor and civic worker John Newport Parkes, at which time the name Kardinia is first listed in the Queensland Post Office Directory. In 1911 title to the property transferred from Macdonald to Alberta Green, wife of prominent North Queensland newspaper proprietor and editor, Humphrey (David) Green. The Green family played a prominent role in the newspaper industry of North Queensland for more than half a century. During their occupancy the house was visited often by the noted North Queensland journalist and author Edmund James Banfield (\\"Beachcomber\\") who was a lifelong friend of the family. Kardinia remained the property of the Green family until sold in 1984.  Description  Kardinia is a substantial, high-set timber residence occupying a commanding position on top of Stanton Hill overlooking the central business district of Townsville. Some external walls have an exposed stud frame while others are lined on the outside. It has a corrugated iron gabled roof. The house is raised on brick piers with some more modern concrete piers. The house has an unusual asymmetrical facade and a U-shaped plan form, reflecting five periods of extension. A central hallway, with large rooms opening off it, extends the length of the main body of the building. To the left of this hallway there are two rooms which are divided by a large cedar arch. To the right, all the rooms open onto the verandah through french doors which have fanlights decorated with etched glass and fretwork. The verandah balustrading is made of cast-iron in a design found in only a few houses in North Queensland. An elaborate wooden frieze extends the full length of the verandah and early timber venetian blinds provide shade and privacy. The rear section, once open verandah, was enclosed to create extra rooms and a bathroom. The service wing which originally contained a maid's room or pantry, kitchen and scullery was converted into a kitchen, possible in 1912. A large dining room was added in 1912 across the rear verandah from the service wing, together with a room built under the house where the land falls away. The windows in this area are of unusual painted glass.  Heritage listing  Kardinia was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Kardinia, erected in the 1880s, is significant historically, architecturally, aesthetically and socially. As the first Japanese consulate in Australia, it was connected with important events in Australian-Japanese trade and diplomatic relations, and illustrates the important connection between Japanese migration and North Queensland in the late 19th/early 20th centuries. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As a colonial house, Kardinia is unusual because of its asymmetric facade which was a rare design feature until after the depression of the 1890s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building also is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of the prestigious type of timber house built in Townsville in the latter part of the 19th century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Kardinia, erected in the 1880s, is significant historically, architecturally, aesthetically and socially. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place is significant for its strong associations with several prominent people in Townsville, including police magistrate John Graham Macdonald and newspaper editor and proprietor David Green, and for its associations with the work of the Japanese government in establishing consular services for its nationals resident in North Queensland.

Origins Although the dating of Bach's three sonatas for viola da gamba and cembalo has presented problems for musicologists, because only an autograph score of the first sonata BWV 1027 survives, there is now general consensus that the works were written in Leipzig at some time in the late 1730s and early 1740s. Prior to that commentators had suggested that they dated from an earlier period when Bach was in C√∂then or even beforehand: the viola da gamba player Christian Ferdinand Abel was one of the court musicians of Prince Leopold at C√∂then. Bach moved to Leipzig as Thomaskantor in 1723 and in 1729 was appointed director of the Collegium Musicum, a chamber music society that put on weekly concerts at the Caf√© Zimmermann. Other versions of BWV 1027 exist: there is a trio sonata for two transverse flutes and continuo (BWV 1039); as well as a trio sonata for organ in three movements. Russell Stinson has determined that the organ work, with the first two movements transcribed from BWV 1039/i and BWV 1039/ii and the last from BWV 1027/iv, is not by Bach but most probably by Johann Peter Kellner. In the late 1980s four new editions of the sonatas appeared, including the Urtext edition of Laurence Dreyfus for C.F. Peters; in a long accompanying text Dreyfus presented detailed arguments for the works to be dated to Bach's period in Leipzig. In a subsequent study of Bach's chamber music, came to the same conclusion and gave provisional dates for many of Bach's chamber music and concertos in his Leipzig period. No precedence had been given to BWV 1027 or BWV 1039, beyond the fact that long notes are easier to sustain on a transverse flute than a harpsichord. The dating of BWV 1027‚Äì1028 is explained in detail by in his analysis of Bach's instrumental works. including his flute sonata in E major (BWV 1035), the triple concerto in A minor for flute, violin and harpsichord (BWV 1044) and the trio sonata for flute, violin and continuo from the Musical Offering (BWV 1079). Musical structure=Sonata No. 1 in G Major, BWV 1027= # Adagio # Allegro ma non tanto # Andante # Allegro moderato The last contrapuntal movement, although not labelled as a bourr√©e, makes reference to this dance form by commencing with a quaver figure on the fourth beat of the bar. =Sonata No. 2 in D Major, BWV 1028= # Adagio # Allegro # Andante # Allegro The first movement begins with the gamba introducing a thematic fragment repeated by the harpsichord. The following movement includes echos and from the first one, especially of the latter half of the first movement. The third movement is in the rhythm of a siciliano, followed by a fast movement in time. Parts of this sonata were used in Bach's St Matthew Passion. Kenyon, pp. 379 =Sonata No. 3 in G Minor, BWV 1029= # Vivace # Adagio # Allegro The musicologist Philipp Spitta has described this sonata as being \\"of the greatest beauty and most striking originality.\\"Berger, pp. 8 The sonata begins with a theme by the viola da gamba, which is soon joined by the harpsichord. This is driven forward with lively figuration. The middle movement, in B major, allows the parts to intertwine even more, ending with the allegro, which begins with repeated notes in the gamba part soon to be taken up by the lower harpsichord part.

The text is attached to the Atharvaveda, and is one of the 20 Sannyasa (renunciation) Upanishads. The Parabrahma Upanishad primarily describes the tradition of the sacred thread and topknot hair tuft worn by housesholders and why both are abandoned by Sannyasi after they have renounced for monastic lifestyle in the Hindu Ashrama system. The text asserts that knowledge is the inner sacrificial string of the renouncers, and knowledge is their true topknot. These wandering monks, states Patrick Olivelle, consider Brahman (unchanging, ultimate reality) as their inner \\"supreme string on which the entire universe is strung like pearls on a string\\". This repeated emphasis on knowledge and the abandonment of external dress and rituals in exchange for the inner equivalent of Atman-Brahman in this medieval era text is similar to those in the ancient Upanishads. The text is notable for its repeated and extended discussion of why Sannyasis renounce topknot and sacred thread they wear as householders. Their hair tuft and thread is no longer external, but internal, states the text, in the form of knowledge and their awareness of Atman-Brahman that threads the universe into unified oneness. The Parabrahma Upanishad links Brahma to consciousness of man when he is awake, Vishnu to his consciousness in dreaming state, Maheshvara (Shiva) to his consciousness in deep sleep, and Brahman as the Turiya, the fourth state of consciousness. The Upanishad calls those who merely have a mass of hair for topknot and visible sacred string across their chest as \\"pseudo-Brahmin\\" with hollow symbols, who aren't acquiring spiritual self- knowledge. The true mendicant, the true seeker of liberation, asserts the text, abandons these external symbols, and focuses on meditating upon and understanding the nature of his soul, ultimate reality and consciousness within the heart. He is a knower of the Veda, of good conduct, the threads of his string are true (tattva) principles, and he wears knowledge within. He pays no heed to external rites, he devotes himself to inner knowledge for liberation with Om and Hamsa (Atman-Brahman). The first chapter of the Parabrahma Upanishad is identical to the first chapter of more ancient Brahma Upanishad. The text also shares many sections with Kathashruti Upanishad. The text also references and includes fragments of Sanskrit text from the Chandogya Upanishad section 6.1, and Aruni Upanishad chapter 7. The composition date or author of Parabrahma Upanishad is not known, but other than chapter 1 it borrows from Brahma Upanishad, the rest of the text is likely a late medieval era text. Olivelle and Sprockhoff suggest it to be 14th- or 15th-century text. Manuscripts of this text have been sometimes titled as Parabrahmopanishad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 451-452 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 78.

After World War II the Allies, consisting of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, sought to promote the bilateral ties with Austria. They wanted to improve not only their formal relationships but also their relationships aside official diplomacy. Hence, several bilateral organisations were founded - including amongst them, the Austro-British Society. For decades, the Society organised language courses and exchange programmes. By 2005, however, the Society had become more and more inactive and ultimately dissolved. Only four years later the Society was refounded by the Austrian Kurt Tiroch. Tiroch, a former manager of the British energy company BP, rallied a group of like-minded people and forged the first plans on how to organise the Society anew. In September 2010, the Society held its constitutive general assembly at the residency of the British ambassador in Vienna and under the presence of then British ambassador to Austria, Simon Smith, and then Austrian ambassador to the United Kingdom, Emil Brix.Previous Events ‚Äì Constitutive general assembly, oebrg.at, accessed on May 16, 2014 Today, the Society counts about 500 members, thereof 57 corporate members (figures for January 2016).

Eastern Georgia (Kartli-Kakheti) was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1801, breaking the terms of the Treaty of Georgievsk. Members of the royal Bagrationi dynasty were deported to the Russian provinces, and Russian control was acknowledged in 1813 by the Treaty of Gulistan. The Georgians, unsatisfied with the Russian rule, yearned for the removal of Russian dominance and the return of their royal dynasty. The goal of independence was kept alive principally by Prince Okropir of Georgia, Suny, p. 71a son of the last eastern Georgian monarch, George XII. Okropir and other Georgians would hold gatherings of Georgian students in Moscow and St. Petersburg, trying to inspire them with patriotic feeling towards their country under Russian rule. It resulted in creation of a secret society in Tbilisi whose main goal was the re-establishment of an independent kingdom under the dethroned Bagrationi. Okropir himself visited Georgia in 1830, and held talks with the principal conspirators, who included members of Georgian aristocrats from the Orbeliani and Eristavi princely houses, as well as the philosopher Solomon Dodashvili. The plot was also supported by the Georgians from western Georgia, i.e. from the Russian- abolished Kingdom of Imereti as well as the members of the House of Shervashidze that ruled Abkhazia. Most of the Georgian conspirators were not liberal republicans, but rather monarchists and nationalists. It was proposed to invite the Russian commander-in-chief in Georgia together with other members of their administration to a grand ball in Tbilisi and at a given signal they would all be assassinated. The Georgians would then seize the Daryal Pass to prevent Russian reinforcements, and Prince Aleksandre of Georgia, son of the Georgian king Erekle II would return from Persia to be proclaimed king of Georgia. The ball at which the Russian officers and administration members were to be killed was scheduled for 20 November 1832, but it was unexpectedly postponed, first to 9 December, then to 20 December. Early in December the whole affair was revealed to the authorities by one of the conspirators, Prince Palavandishvili, and all of them were arrested. Ten of the accused conspirators were sentenced to death but later reprieved and deported to distant Russian provinces instead, largely because of their aristocratic status.Suny, p. 72 The 1832 plot, though unsuccessful, would play an important role in the national liberation movement that Georgians would seek to organize more fruitfully.

From its beginnings in 1902 as the Queensland Agricultural Bank, Suncorp Bank has grown into the fifth largest bank in Australia. History The information in this section relates specifically to Suncorp Bank. For information relating to the group as a whole, see the history of the Suncorp Group. =State Government Insurance Office= Suncorp Bank commenced business in 1916 as the State Accident Insurance Office. Not long after, it changed its name to State Government Insurance Office (SGIO) and extended its operations into life insurance, general insurance and Compulsory Third Party. Over the years, superannuation, building society, and finance operations were added. =Queensland Industry Development Corporation (QIDC)= QIDC commenced operations in 1986, but evolved from the Queensland Agricultural Bank established in 1902. Initially operating primarily as a rural financier, QIDC expanded its activities to include commercial lending to small and medium- sized businesses. =Suncorp-Metway Merger= On 1 December 1996, the Queensland Government owned Suncorp and QIDC entities were merged with the publicly listed company Metway Bank to create the new allfinanz group Suncorp Metway. At the time of the merger, Suncorp and QIDC were 100% Queensland Government owned. Suncorp was operating as an allfinanz group with approximately $10 billion in assets, while QIDC had total assets of $3 billion. Metway Bank was Queensland's largest locally based bank with operations in New South Wales and Victoria. At the time of the merger, Metway Bank had approximately $7.1 billion in assets. It was established as the Metropolitan Permanent Building Society in 1959. In 1988, it converted to bank status and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). The Queensland State Government proposed the merger of the three companies to create a more competitive financial institution better geared to meet the needs of the future. The merger also created Australia's fifth largest listed financial services group with the associated economic benefits of a major Australian corporate headquarters located in Queensland. The merger and amalgamation of the three companies was completed in 1999. In May 1999, the new brand, Suncorp Metway, launched. This enabled the delivery of the group's resources under one banner, the streamlining of the product range and elimination of duplication in the branch network. =Reducing the State Government's share of the business= The state government was initially the largest shareholder of the new group with a 68% holding consisting of shares and capital notes in return for the sale of Suncorp and QIDC to Metway Bank; the other 32% was held by existing Metway shareholders. At the time, the state government indicated its intention to sell down its holding in stages within five years to no more than 15%. In September 1997, the State Government announced a public issue of 100 million Exchanging Installment Notes giving preference to existing customers and shareholders of Suncorp, Metway and QIDC. On completion of the offer, the State Government's effective interest in the company was reduced to around 4%. The public paid $6.10 for the notes in two instalments and these exchanged for ordinary shares on 1 November 1999, increasing the number of Suncorp Metway shareholders from 36,000 to approximately 111,000. Twelve months later the State Government announced a total sell down of its shareholding through a second Exchanging Installment Notes issue. Like the first notes issue, the second issue attracted considerable public interest and was substantially oversubscribed. The public paid $7.10 in two installments, the second being paid on 6 November 2000. These notes were exchanged for ordinary shares on 31 October 2001. =No more 'Metway'= On 1 July 2002, the brand was simplified to Suncorp (i.e. Metway was dropped).

Kimathi (aka: Irritated Genie of Soufeese) Ayo H. Kimathi (born December 2, 1973) is a Black nationalist, anti-LGBT activist, and international lecturer. Born in Southeast Greater Community hospital, he spent his early life in Southeast Washington, D.C., where he became interested in Black history and racial politics. He is most known for his opposition to homosexuality and pedophilia in the Black world community and his openly expressed animus towards white supremacy. The title he goes by when lecturing is the \\"Irritated Genie of Soufeese.\\" His website has endorsed the killing of whites and \\"black traitors\\". At one point it held an \\"enemies list\\" which included Rev.Al Sharpton, Lil Wayne, Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and President Barack Obama. In July 2009, Kimathi began working in government contracting at Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) as a Small Business Specialist. On August 21, 2013, his identity as a Black Nationalist leader who spoke out vocally against homosexuality in the Black community was exposed in an online article from The Wire. Once news of this article spread to mainstream news networks such as CNN,http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2013/08/23/tsr-johns-dhs-employee-linked-to- hate-website.cnn FOX News, Huffington Post. Kimathi was put on paid leave and eventually fired in December 2013.https://www.rt.com/usa/homeland-security- ayo-kimathi-151/ In 2015, Kimathi was elected International Spokesman of a newly created movement called the Straight Black Pride Movement (SBPM). In the same year, he was officially banned from the country of Bermuda for a lecture he did stating among other things that, \\"Black men should only date and marry Black women.\\" Based on his adamant stance against homosexuality, interracial dating and marriage, and sex, the Home Affairs Minister for Bermuda, Michael Fahy, banned Ayo Kimathi from Bermuda for at least (5) years in 2015.  Work life  In 1995, Kimathi took a job as a Small Business Specialist for the Department of the Navy. He worked there until 2003 when he quit to write the book, 'War on the Horizon -Black Resistance to the white-sex Assault' which he self-published in 2005. In 2009, after 6 years doing lectures and acting as a part-time real estate agent, Kimathi returned to the U.S. Government Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the capacity of assisting small businesses in winning contracts. He was eventually fired in December 2013 for his lecture work done under the pseudonym \\"Irritated Genie of Soufeese.\\" The 'Irritated Genie' is the title of a book authored by Jacob Carruthers and it refers to the spirit of the Black people who fought in the Haitian Revolution. 'Soufeese' is a take-off of the region of Washington, D.C., where Kimathi grew up, Southeast. In August 2015, he joined a newly formed movement called the Straight Black Pride Movement (SBPM). In September 2015, Kimathi traveled to Bermuda to perform his Effeminization of the Black Male lecture. In this lecture, Effeminization of the Black Male in Bermuda, he spoke to the audience about the SBPM. As a result of this lecture, the Minister of Home Affairs for Bermuda, Michael Fahy, officially banned the Ayo Kimathi from the country for 5 years. On December 18, 2015, the Human Rights Commission of Bermuda submitted Kimathi a complaint about the lecture he gave in Bermuda where he stated that Black men should only date and marry Black women and that homosexuality originated from white Europeans along with other forms of ‚Äúsexual deviance‚Äù including child molestation, bestiality and rape.

Generally speaking, it has advocated for a more militarist foreign policy (with the exception of isolationist and libertarian elements). Republican presidents have joined or started a number of wars over the course of American history, with mixed results. Republicans supported Woodrow Wilson's call for American entry into World War I in 1917, complaining only that he was too slow to go to war. Republicans in 1919 opposed his call for entry into the League of Nations. A majority supported the League with reservations; a minority opposed membership on any terms. Republicans sponsored world disarmament in the 1920s, and isolationism in the 1930s.Alex Goodall, \\"US Foreign Relations under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover,\\" in Katherine A.S. Sibley, ed., A Companion to Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover (2014) pp: 53‚Äì76 online. Most Republicans staunchly opposed intervention in World War II until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. By 1945, however, internationalists became dominant in the party which supported the Cold War policies such as the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and NATO. 1950s: Dwight Eisenhower In 1952 General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the NATO supreme commander, was drafted by the Republican Party to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. Eisenhower's campaign was a crusade against the Truman administration's policies regarding \\"Korea, Communism and Corruption\\". 1970s: Nixon-Ford Most Republicans supported Nixon-Ford-Kissinger policy of Vietnamization (letting Vietnam do the fighting with American arms) and their policy of d√©tente with the Soviet Union and China. The conservative wing, led by Reagan, denounced d√©tente with the USSR but was defeated by Ford in 1976, When Ford lost his reelection bid to Jimmy Carter, Reagan's approach dominated the party.Sean Wilentz, The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974‚Äì2008 (2008) pp 48‚Äì72 1981‚Äì1989: Ronald Reagan=Cold War= President Reagan reignited the Cold War. D√©tente was rejected in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter in the face of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Reagan then ordered a massive buildup of the United States Armed Forces, especially the SDI project to undermine the Soviet nuclear threat by shooting down its missiles.Norman Podhoretz, \\"The Reagan Road to D√©tente\\", Foreign Affairs (1984) 63#3 pp. 447‚Äì464 in JSTOR =Grenada= U.S. Army Rangers conduct an airborne assault in Saint George Parish, Grenada during the hostilities. On October 25, 1983, at the request of the regional governments, Reagan ordered Operation Urgent Fury, a military invasion of the small Caribbean island of Grenada, where over a thousand American students and their families were in residence. A Marxist coup d'√©tat had overthrown the established government and shot its leader Maurice Bishop. This was the first actual rollback that destroyed a Communist regime and marked the continued escalation of tensions with the Soviet Union known as the Second Cold War. Democrats had been highly critical of Reagan's anti-Communism in Latin America, but this time Reagan had strong support from the voters and leading Democrats said the invasion was justified.Steven F. Hayward, The age of Reagan: The conservative counterrevolution, 1980‚Äì1989, p. 323 It built the President's image of decisive strong action a year before the 1984 election, when Mondale said he too would have ordered the invasion. Indeed, Mondale attacked Senator Gary Hart, his chief opponent for the Democratic nomination, as isolationist and weak on fighting dictatorships.Robert Kagan, A twilight struggle: American power and Nicaragua, 1977‚Äì1990 (1996) p. 346 =Covert operations= Under a policy that came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine, Reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid to anti- communist resistance movements in an effort to \\"roll back\\" Soviet-backed communist governments in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The policy was politically controversial, with liberal Democrats especially angry with Reagan's operations in Latin America.Robert Kagan, A twilight struggle: American power and Nicaragua, 1977‚Äì1990 (1996) p. 29 Covert operations elsewhere, especially in Afghanistan against the Soviets, however, usually won bipartisan support.Jagmohan Meher, America's Afghanistan war (2004) p. 133 online 1989‚Äì1993: George H. W. Bush=1990‚Äì91: Gulf War= On August 1, 1990, Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait. President Bush formed an international coalition and secured UN approval to expel Iraq. On January 12, 1991, Congress voted approval for a military attack, Operation Desert Storm, by a narrow margin, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. The vote in the House was 250‚Äì183, and in the Senate 52‚Äì47. In the Senate 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats voted yes to war, while 45 Democrats and two Republicans voted no. In the House 164 Republicans and 86 Democrats voted yes, and 179 Democrats, three Republicans and one Independent voted no.Dilip Hiro, Desert Shield to Desert Storm: The Second Gulf War (2003) p. 300 The war was short and successful, but Hussein was allowed to remain in power. Arab countries repaid all the American military costs.Gary R. Hess, Presidential Decisions for War: Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and Iraq (2009) pp 153‚Äì219 1993‚Äì2001: Opposition politics In the 1990s, Republicans in Congress split over U.S. military intervention in the Yugoslav wars under Democratic President Bill Clinton. Examples of interventionist-minded Republicans are then Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Senator John McCain and examples of opposing figures are later Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Majority Leader Dick Armey, the latter of which who called Kosovo deployment \\"poorly considered and unlikely to achieve our desired ends\\". In 2000, successful Republican Presidential candidate George W. Bush ran on a platform that generally opposed U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts, saying that the U.S. didn't have the responsibly of \\"nation building\\". As such, he advocated U.S. military withdrawal from the Balkan NATO peacekeeping mission. 2001‚Äì2009: George W. Bush=Invasion of Afghanistan= After the September 11 attacks in 2001 in New York, Bush launched the War on Terrorism, in which the United States led an international coalition invaded Afghanistan, the base of terrorist Osama bin Laden. This invasion led to the toppling of the Taliban regime. After a surprise raid on bin Laden's compound on May 2, 2011, ordered by Barack Obama, bin Laden was killed and his body disposed of in the sea. There was bipartisan support for this action, with notable Republican and Democratic figures speaking out in support of the raid. =Invasion of Iraq= President George W. Bush, surrounded by leaders of the House and Senate, announces the Iraq war resolution on October 2, 2002. In 2003, following the bipartisan Iraq war resolution and the perceived issues regarding UN weapons inspectors, President Bush launched the invasion of Iraq, in conjunction with coalition partners, most notably, the United Kingdom. The invasion was described by Bush as being part of the general 'War on Terrorism'. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was captured and executed, but his supporters and other opposing forces staged an insurgency that dragged on for years. It was a major election issue in 2004 (when Bush was reelected) and in 2006 and 2008 (when President Obama was first elected to the Presidency, and Democrats increased their numbers in both Houses of Congress).Hess, Presidential Decisions for War: Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and Iraq (2009) pp 221‚Äì76 Significant public support for the war effort existed in the early days among both parties and others, but opinions changed course soon with about half of Americans surveyed in November 2003 judging the end result as not worth it. The lack of expected stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and the failures of the military occupation of Iraq altered voters' views. Polling done by CBS News on the ten-year anniversary of the U.S. invasion found that Republicans, by a margin of 61%, believed that the military action was the right thing to do, with majorities of Democrats and independents disagreeing. However, that same poll found that Republicans were divided on 46% to 45% lines on the question of if U.S. forces succeeded in their overall objectives. By January 2014, 52% of Republicans were supportive of military action in Iraq, with 38% saying the war had succeeded, showing that support for the war among Republicans has declined over time. 2009‚Äì2016 President Barack Obama, inaugurated in January 2009 and later reelected to a second term, continued the previous policy of keeping large- scale intervention in the War in Afghanistan, with a plan of removing combat troops while Afghan forces trained to replace them until late 2014. An October 2012 Pew Research Center poll found Republicans evenly divided at 48% over the choices of keeping American military forces in Afghanistan \\"until the situation has stabilized\\" analogous to Obama's policies versus making them leave \\"as soon as possible\\". An article in the news-magazine Foreign Policy stated that this represented a move from a previous \\"hawkish\\" stance by Republicans. =The Arab Spring= The Republican Party has been largely split on the attitude the United States should take in response to the events of the Arab Spring. Republican leadership in the House and Senate supported the 2011 military intervention in Libya, though many conservative congressional Republicans, such as Michele Bachmann, voted in opposition to the intervention. Similarly, many senior Republicans, including presidential candidates John McCain, Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio supported arming the Syrian rebels, while conservative Republicans in Congress proclaimed their opposition to this. Congressional Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, were overwhelmingly opposed to the proposed US military intervention in Syria. In both Libya and Syria, Republicans opposed to intervention have cited Islamist influence within the rebel groups and a lack of U.S. national security interest as the reason for their opposition. During the 2016 presidential election cycle, many prominent Republicans, including John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and even figures typically associated with the interventionist wing of the party, such as Tom Cotton and Rudy Giuliani, have criticized the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her decision to support the intervention in Libya as Secretary of State. =Ukraine= Leading Republicans in Congress all supported sanctions against Russia in response to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. No major politician of either party opposed the first rounds of American and EU sanctions in April 2014.Katrina vanden Heuvel and Stephen F. Cohen, \\"Cold War Against Russia‚ÄîWithout Debate: The Obama administration's decision to isolate Russia, in a new version of 'containment,' has met with virtually unanimous support from the political and media establishment\\", The Nation May 19, 2014 (published May 1, 2014) online A minority of Republicans, such as Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and Donald Trump, have been critical of U.S. support for the Ukrainian government, urging closer ties with Russia. =Iran= Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have generally favored sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program. Congressional Republicans and 2016 Republican presidential candidates universally opposed approval of the Obama administration's Iran deal, which would lift sanctions in exchange for increased inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. 2016‚Äìpresent: Donald Trump=Russia= Under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the new Republican administration has shifted to a much less hawkish stance on the Russian Federation, with Republican leaders considering lifting sanctions on Russia and Trump nominating a Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, who has strong ties to Russia. There has also been a marked change in the attitudes of Republican voters towards Russian President Vladimir Putin. In July 2014, 66% of Republicans viewed Putin unfavorably, but as of December 2016, only 10% do so. =China= The administration has demonstrated a more hostile stance towards the People's Republic of China, with Trump breaking U.S. diplomatic convention since the Shanghai Communiqu√© by taking a call from the President of the Republic of China Tsai Ing-wen, leading to a rebuke by the PRC government. There has been some speculation that the rapprochement with Russia is intended to isolate the PRC, which has shared strong relations with Russia over the past two decades after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Tiananmen Square protests. =Syria= The Trump administration has taken a different stance from the previous Obama administration on the issue of the Syrian Civil War, with UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson both stating in March 2017 that the United States would no longer prioritize the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from office, in line with Trump's stance during his campaign.

Ben Simpson, the held of the original ownership syndicate, was also the builder. Construction was supervised in the summer of 1852 by George A. Pease (1830-1918). Oregon was 120 feet long. The beam (width) of the steamer was , probably exclusive of the guards. The depth of hold was 5 feet. Oregon was described as a small sidewheeler and a poor money earner. Operations pilot of the Oregon. Upon completion, Parker and J.D. Shields served as captains. George A. Pease was the pilot of the Oregon until July 1853. Another report states that Jacob Wortman (1827-1904)., later president of the First National Bank of McMinnville, was the captain of Oregon, starting in 1853. Fare from Oregon City to Corvallis, Oregon was then $30 for a trip. Starting on December 3, 1853, the \\"fast running steamer\\" Oregon was advertised as making regular runs from Oregon to Marysville, as Corvallis was then known, and way landings. On March 4, 1854, the steamer Oregon was reported to have been purchased by the Willamette Falls Mill and Transport Company, sometimes referred to as the Willamette Falls Company. On March 17, 1854, the Willamette Falls Company placed into service a new steamer, the side-wheeler Gazelle, giving the company, briefly, two steamers operating above Willamette Falls. Loss Shortly after Gazelle was placed in operation, Oregon was sunk and became a total loss. Oregon hit a snag just down river from Salem, and began sinking. Word was passed to Gazelle, which steamed upriver and stood by as Oregon was filling with water. Cargo from the Oregon was loaded onto Gazelle to lighten Oregon to better allow salvaging. Suddenly Oregon broke free of the snag, drifted downstream, ran up on a sandbar and sank so deeply that only a part of the upper works were visible above the water. Oregon was a total loss. Gazelle itself was destroyed by a boiler explosion only a short time later, on April 8, 1854, ending the brief steamboat operations of the Willamette Falls Company NotesReferences=Printed sources=  =Newspaper collections= * Category:People's Transportation Company Category:Steamboats of the Willamette River Category:Ships built in Oregon ","title":"Oregon (sidewheeler 1852)"},{"id":"49162705","title":"Taipei City Constituency VIII"},{"id":"49162713","text":"\\"Charlotte's Web\\" is the twelfth episode of the sixth season and the 132nd episode overall of the Freeform mystery drama series Pretty Little Liars. The episode was broadcast on 19 January 2016. It was written by Jonell Lennon and Lijah J. Barasz and directed by Joanna Kerns.  Plot  As the girls overcome the shock of Charlotte's death, Alison (Sasha Pieterse) enlists Lorenzo (Travis Winfrey) to find the murderer. Aria (Lucy Hale) begins to look guilty as she returns to Boston a day earlier than she was supposed to; before she leaves, Hanna (Ashley Benson) tells her that she knows Aria left the hotel during the night when everybody else was asleep, but Aria denies it, saying she had gone to get something from her car. However, her return to Boston is short-lived; her boss at the publishing company is upset that Ezra (Ian Harding) has returned the advance on his new book and sends Aria back to Rosewood to convince him. Emily (Shay Mitchell) continues to lie about her life in California and is seen taking blood tests at a medical center. When Sabrina (Lulu Brud), the new manager of the Brew sees her, Emily tells her not to tell anybody, not giving an explanation for why she was at the medical center. Hanna is surprised by her fianc√©, Jordan (David Coussins), while Spencer (Troian Bellisario) and Caleb (Tyler Blackburn) continue a questionable, yet unromantic, relationship. Alison invites the girls over to dinner, where she implies that she believes Aria had something to do with the murder. Hanna is able to access surveillance footage of the hotel from the night Charlotte died and discovers that Aria had left the hotel with Ezra soon before Charlotte was killed. They confront Aria, who reveals that, unable to sleep, she had called Ezra, and the two had gone for a walk. They had noticed a blonde in a red jacket, who Ezra thought was Charlotte, going into the church and Ezra, obviously angry that Charlotte had been set free, said good night to Aria and sent her off in a taxi. Aria is afraid that Ezra may have done something to Charlotte out of anger. Alison calls Lorenzo, telling him she thinks her friends may have had something to do with the murder. Emily visits her father's grave, vowing to make things right, but is scared away by Sara Harvey (Dre Davis), visiting Charlotte's grave. The episode ends with an unknown person leaving the graveyard and a limo driver opening a car door while saying, \\"I'm sorry for your loss\\"  Production  \\"Charlotte's Web\\" was written by Jonell Lennon and Lijah J.

Paul Dailly from TV Fanatic was surprised with the episode stating that \\"there wasn't as much filler as we normally get in a post-premiere episode.\\" She continued to say that \\"the new mystery has really given the show a new lease on life. At least for now.\\" Elizabeth Backo from The Post also responded positively and while she described it as \\"...not an overly exciting episode\\", she was impressed with the tightly scripted narrative, highlighting that \\"more mysteries are revealed, viewers finally get to see some character development from a few liars and a little romance begins to spark.\\" Caroline Preece from Den of Geek also praised the writers for setting up an intricate plot, stating that \\"Hanna and Caleb are able to have a conversation, but we still don't know why they aren't together. Alison is still Alison, but she's an amalgamation of the old Ali and the new, domesticated family girl. It's a balance, and so far it's been done perfectly.\\" Writing for SpoilerTV, Gavin Hetherington particularly enjoyed the new individual storylines for the characters, describing them as the \\"best they've been in years...even for characters I stopped caring about ages ago.\\" Jeremy Rodriguez from The Young Folks shared the same sentiments in regards to the character's personal lives, proclaiming that \\"for the first time in awhile, I can honestly say I care about the show‚Äôs smaller mysteries.\\" While he described the episode as not \\"exactly phenomenal\\", he praised the show's new direction for \\"slowly but surely, becoming the reboot the series and the fans deserve.\\"  References  External links  * Category:Pretty Little Liars episodes Category:2016 American television episodes ","title":"Charlotte's Web (Pretty Little Liars)"},{"id":"49162719","text":"The 1916 Birthday Honours were appointments by King George V to various orders and honours to reward and highlight good works by citizens of the British Empire.

The Bosstown Sound (or Boston Sound) was the catchphrase of a marketing campaign to promote psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop bands in Boston, Massachusetts, in the late 1960s. The concept was conceived by the record producer Alan Lorber as a marketing strategy intended to establish several underground musical artists native to the city on the national charts and compete with the popular San Francisco Sound. Lorber chose Boston for his plan because of the several bands developing in the city, the abundance of music venues (such as the Boston Tea Party), and the proximity of MGM Records, which had signed the core groups. The Bosstown Sound was promoted as harnessing the hallucinogenic essence of psychedelia, also known at the time as acid rock. Numerous bands were involved, but the groups Ultimate Spinach, the Beacon Street Union, and Orpheus were the most prominent. The Boston music scene briefly captured the interest of the youth culture, and recordings by bands from Boston achieved positions on the Billboard 200 chart. However, by the end of 1969, the campaign faltered, its advertisements rejected by listeners. Critics panned the groups involved, and few of the Bosstown bands survived after the scene collapsed. Opinions are still mixed, but the music of these bands has received more positive assessments in recent years. History=Pre-scene= Prior to the Bosstown Sound, Boston had a burgeoning garage rock scene with bands such as the Remains, the Rising Storm, Teddy and the Pandas, and the Rockin' Ramrods at the forefront. The most commercially successful group in the area was the proto-punk teen band the Barbarians, who reached the Billboard Hot 100 twice with the singles \\"Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl\\" and \\"Moulty\\". The heyday of these bands pre-dated the Bosstown Sound, and they did not have much involvement in the Sound's development, with the notable exception of the album Basic Magnetism, by Teddy and the Pandas. The main problem was a lack of viable rock music venues to bring the groups together into a unified music scene. Also missing were the local and regional record labels often associated with a developing rock scene. Perhaps more evident in what grew into the Bosstown Sound was the city's equally active folk scene which was led by key figures like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Mimi Farina. Their influences later emerged in the music by mainstay Bosstown bands Orpheus and Earth Opera. What became the genesis of the Bosstown Sound is said to exist, at least in rudimentary form, as early as June 1967, when journalist Mel Lyman's first issue of Avatar was pressed. His newspaper carried an advertisement promoting a scheduled event, headlined by two of Boston's earliest psychedelic rock bands, Ill Wind and the Hallucinations, at the Boston Tea Party. Ill Wind and the Hallucinations' performances helped establish the Boston Tea Party as a must-go-to venue for the city's psychedelic scene, and soon other like-minded musical acts‚Äîamong them the Velvet Underground, the Peanut Butter Conspiracy, and Lothar and the Hand People‚Äîbecame frequent attractions. Journalist Earl Greyland, described the Boston Tea Party's importance in Boston After Dark: \\"[It] occurred on March 15, 1968, when, as the staid WBCN audience sat listening to its usual Muzak, the voice of Frank Zappa asked, 'Are you hung up?' and Cream launched into 'I Feel Free'. That was the beginning of the American Revolution, a daily seven- hour program originating from the dressing room of the Tea Party. The combination of providing an established performance setting and radio exposure made the Tea Party a gig second in importance only to the Fillmore\\". Other psychedelic venues that contributed to the promotion of the underground music scene in Boston include the Psychedelic Supermarket, the Crosstown Bus, the Catacombs, and the Unicorn. =\\"The Sound Heard Around the World\\"= Record producer Alan Lorber materialized a concept to congregate several progressive Boston bands, and promote them as a new unique music scene, in a similar fashion that led to the birth of the San Francisco Sound. In his article Bosstown Sound 1968 - The Music and Time, Lorber wrote Boston was a logical epicenter for his marketing plan \\"since it was a place for new and progressive music forms from the folk days, and had an exceptionally strong initial sales potential in the 250,000 college students in residence in Boston's 250 colleges and universities\\". Lorber also mentioned that Boston \\"had a large number of performance clubs where artists could develop before touring nationally. There were many pop music college and commercial radio stations which could expose the new product on a grass-roots level\\". Based on his past successes with the label, MGM Records agreed to showcase the bands Lorber signed. Conviently, the company's studio was situated in New York City, making it easier for Lorber to manage and record several groups. Another important figure in the Bosstown Sound was Dick Summer, one of Boston's most popular deejays, who worked at that time for WBZ (AM). Diane White, \\"What's All This Noise About Boston Sound?\\" Boston Globe, February 28, 1968, p. 31. After Summer left WBZ in 1968, he ultimately returned to Boston and was hired by WMEX Radio in May 1969, and he continued to play the Boston Sound bands. Ernie Santosuosso, \\"New Look WMEX,\\" Boston Globe, May 29, 1969, p. 41. Summer was directly responsible for the initial radio boom that Bosstown musical acts would experience, and arranged concerts and outdoor festivals in the Boston area where the local bands could hone their skills in anticipation of being signed to a recording deal. It was also Summer who coined the \\"Bosstown Sound\\" phrase to create a sense of cohesion among the bands. On January 20, 1968, MGM Records commenced its advertisement campaign for the Bosstown Sound by funding for a patriotic-style ad in Billboard magazine that read: \\"The Sound Heard Around the World; Boston!!\\". On the same date, three Boston-based groups known well to the underground scene -- Ultimate Spinach (better known as Underground Cinema prior to the album), Beacon Street Union, and Orpheus had their debut albums released on the MGM label. The anticipation of the Bosstown Sound's debut to the record-buying public generated a booming market for Boston-based bands. Beacon Street Union's The Eyes of the Beacon Street Union charted at number 75 on the Billboard 200, and Orpheus's self-titled debut reached number 119. Although Orpheus is pegged as a part of the Bosstown Sound, music historian Richie Unterberger notes they were \\"sentimental pop writers at heart\\" reminiscent of the Association, rather than the psychedelic bands that comprised much of the Sound. Later benefiting from their more commercially accessible sound, Orpheus was among the few Bosstown bands to have a single (\\"can't Find The Time\\" in 1968 and 1969, since covered by the Rose Colored Glass and by Hootie and the Blowfish, and the minor 1969 hit \\"Brown Arms in Houston\\") chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Emerging from the original three MGM-signed groups, Ultimate Spinach‚Äîmasterminded by singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ian Bruce-Douglas‚Äîachieved the most commercial success from their debut effort, which peaked at number 35 and sold approximately 110,000 copies in 1968. Despite sharp criticism from music critics upon release, overtime the album, now regarded as an acid rock classic, has become a cult favorite among psychedelic aficionados and is the highlight of the Bosstown Sound. Following in the trend set by the first three Bosstown groups on their label, MGM Records released other material by local groups such as Chamaeleon Church and Kangeroo. Attempting to cash-in on the sudden craze, other major labels like Elektra Records and ABC Records signed their own assortment of bands native to the city. Among them was Eden's Children, which released a Jimi Hendrix-inspired album in 1968 that charted in the Billboard 200 at 196. Apple Pie Motherhood Band deviated from the psychedelic sound, recording two LPs that incorporated an assortment of bluesy originals and covers. Young teen group, the Freeborne recorded the album Peak Impressions, an ambitious, but somewhat unpredictable, piece that experimented with a variety of instruments. Another group known as Listening recorded a self- titled album in late-1968, which encompassed performances by former Velvet Underground bassist Walter Powers and guitarist Peter Malick. Several additional groups were also associated with the scene such as Earth Opera, the Tangerine Zoo, the Art of Lovin', and Ill Wind. =Decline and reception= Almost immediately following the success of the Bosstown Sound campaign, music critics began to comment on the apparent lack of originality of some of the bands. Another issue discussed was the diversity among Boston's musical artists, which brought to question whether there was an actual effort to create a unified scene or a manufactured attempt to cash in on the popularity of psychedelia. Music journalist Paul Williams, writing for Crawdaddy!, homed in on the concern: \\"[T]here isn't any common consciousness in the Boston rock scene -- there isn't even any Boston rock scene. There are good groups coming out of that area but there isn't the spiritual unity that San Francisco had\\". A Jazz & Pop article remarked that \\"the sound doesn't exist except in the head of Alan Lorber\\". The newly established Rolling Stone magazine questioned \\"whether or not there is anything lying beneath the hype\\", describing the Boston groups as pretentious and boring. A few articles, such as one in Newsweek, attempted to defend the scene, saying a sense of unity was found in \\"subdued, artful electronic sound, an insistence on clear, understandable lyrics, the spice of dissonance and the infusion of classical textures\\". By early 1969, nearly all the Bosstown groups had either disbanded or disappeared from the public view as a consequence of media and youth culture backlash. Ultimate Spinach barely managed to chart at number 198 with their album Behold & See, which noticeably lacked the organ-driven instrumentals that were featured on their debut. Following Bruce-Douglas's departure from the band, Ultimate Spinach released one third and final album called Ultimate Spinach III', but directionless, in 1969 with a almost completely reconstructed lineup. The Beacon Street Union's The Clown Died in Marvin Gardens was plagued by the Sound's negative stigma, and only reached number 175. Orpheus was among the few groups to remain active into the 1970s, and has since conducted reunions in the 1980s and, again, in the 2000s. In the aftermath of the Bosstown Sound, reviews remain mixed, but critics have begun to describe the scene in a better light. In 1988, Rolling Stone magazine, while reevaluating the Sound, conceded it was perhaps \\"easier to put down Ultimate Spinach and the other Boston groups than it had been to like them\\". Music critic Steve Nelson notes that after \\"the hype died down, Boston in fact turned out to be a great incubator of musical talent, producing acts like J. Geils, Aerosmith, and The Cars\\". While interviewing Bruce-Douglas in 2001, critic Gary Burns stated Ultimate Spinach, which received the brunt of the media stigma focusing on Bosstown, \\"deserved a much better fate. The Bosstown hype was not their idea, and their records are some of the best psychedelic music available then or now. Their brief time in the spotlight brought them not well-earned glory but unexpected trauma, which fractured an already-fragile band\\". Others, like Richie Unterberger, dismissed the bands' work as \\"poor third cousins to the West Coast psychedelic groups that served as their obvious inspirations\\". In 1996, Big Beat Records released the compilation album Bosstown Sound, 1968: The Music & the Time, which included an assortment of Bosstown and pre-scene bands. In 2001, Best of the Bosstown Sound followed with a more condensed track listing.

The party consists of moderates, sometimes described as establishment Republicans, and members of the Tea Party or Freedom Caucus, who have been described as populist, right-wing, and far-right. The party also incorporates several other factions, such as Libertarian Republicans, who advocate libertarian policies. The positions of the Republican Party have evolved over time. Contemporarily, the party's economic conservatism involves support for lower taxes, free market capitalism, deregulation of corporations, and restrictions on labor unions. The party's social conservatism includes support gun rights and other traditional values, often with a Christian foundation, including restrictions on abortion.Paul Gottfried, Conservatism in America: Making Sense of the American Right, p. 9, \\"Postwar conservatives set about creating their own synthesis of free-market capitalism, Christian morality, and the global struggle against Communism.\\" (2009); Gottfried, Theologies and moral concern (1995) p. 12 In foreign policy, Republicans usually favor increased military spending, unilateral action, and anti- Communist revolutions, especially during the 1980s and 1990s. Other Republican positions include restrictions on immigration, opposition to drug legalization, and support for school choice. Economic policies Republican party leaders strongly believe that free markets and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity. To this end, they advocate in favor of laissez-faire economics, fiscal conservatism, and eliminating government run welfare programs in favor of private sector nonprofits and encouraging personal responsibility. A leading economic theory advocated by modern Republicans is supply side economics. Some fiscal policies influenced by this theory were popularly known as Reaganomics, a term popularized during the Ronald Reagan administration. This theory holds that reduced income tax rates increase GDP growth and thereby generate the same or more revenue for the government from the smaller tax on the extra growth. This belief is reflected, in part, by the party's long-term advocacy of tax cuts. Many Republicans consider the income tax system to be inherently inefficient and oppose graduated tax rates, which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth. They also believe private spending is usually more efficient than government spending. Republicans generally oppose the estate tax. Between the 19th century and the early 20th century, Republicans favored tariffs to protect and encourage American industry and industrial workers. In 1896, the GOP platform pledged to \\"renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence, and the foundation of development and prosperity. This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry. It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods; it secures the American market for the American producer. It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman.\\" Republicans introduced and strongly supported the welfare reform of 1996, which was signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton and limited eligibility for welfare, successfully allowing many former welfare recipients to find jobs. The party opposes a government-run single-payer health care system, claiming it constitutes socialized medicine and is in favor of a personal or employer-based system of insurance, supplemented by Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid, which covers approximately 40% of the poor.Unsettling Scores: A Ranking of State Medicaid Programs, p. 15 Republicans have a mixed record of supporting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Congressional Republicans and the Bush administration supported to reduce Medicaid's growth rate; however, congressional Republicans expanded Medicare, supporting a new drug plan for seniors starting in 2006. In 2011, Republicans in the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted for a proposal known as The Path to Prosperity and for major changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and the 2010 health care legislation. Many Republicans support increased health insurance portability, laws promoting coverage of pre- existing medical conditions, a cap on malpractice lawsuits, implementing a streamlined electronic medical records system, an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care, and tax benefits aimed to make health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and to promote universal access. They generally oppose government funding for elective abortions. Labor unions Since the 1920s Republicans have generally been opposed to labor unions, which comprise a major component of the Democratic New Deal coalition. Although unions have lost membership in the private sector since the 1970s, they have gained among public sector unions (such as school teachers). Republicans at the state level generally support various right to work laws that weaken unions. At the national level Republicans supported the Taft- Hartley Act of 1947, one of the most immensely anti-communist acts which gives workers the right not to participate in unions, as opposed to a closed shop, which prohibits workers from choosing not to join unions in workplaces. Most Republicans are opposed to increases in the minimum wage, believing that such increases hurt many businesses by forcing them to cut jobs and services, export jobs overseas, and raise the prices of goods to compensate for the decrease in profit. As Taylor Dark has emphasized in his analysis of the enduring alliance between labor unions and the Democrats, the unions' \\"most virulent opponents have moved into the Republican Party\\". Republicans elected with Tea Party support in 2010, most notably Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, have launched major efforts against public sector unions due in part to state government pension obligations along with the allegation that the unions are too powerful.Nelson Lichtenstein, \\"Can This Election Save the Unions?\\", Dissent Summer 2012. Walker was challenged by a coalition of unions and Democrats, but beat back a recall effort and was reelected in 2014.Jason Stein and Patrick Marley, More than They Bargained For: Scott Walker, Unions, and the Fight for Wisconsin (2013). Separation of powers and balance of powers Many contemporary Republicans voice support of strict constructionism or textualism, the judicial philosophy that the Constitution should be interpreted narrowly and as close to the original intent as is practicable rather than a more flexible \\"living Constitution\\" model. Most Republicans point to Roe v. Wade as a case of judicial activism, where the court overturned most laws restricting abortion on the basis of a right to privacy inferred from the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Some Republicans have actively sought to block judges whom they see as being activist judges and have sought the appointment of judges who claim to practice judicial restraint. The issue of judicial deference to the legislature is a matter of some debate‚Äîlike the Democrats, most Republicans criticize court decisions that overturn their own (conservative) legislation as overstepping bounds and support decisions that overturn opposing legislation. Some commentators have advocated that the Republicans take a more aggressive approach and support legislative supremacy more firmly. The Republican Party has supported various bills within the last decade to strip some or all federal courts of the ability to hear certain types of cases, in an attempt to strengthen the power of individual state's rights. These jurisdiction stripping laws have included removing federal review of the recognition of same-sex marriage with the Marriage Protection Act, the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance with the Pledge Protection Act, and the rights of detainees in Guantanamo Bay in the Detainee Treatment Act. The Supreme Court overruled the last of these limitations in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. Compared to Democrats, many Republicans believe in a more robust version of federalism with greater limitations placed upon federal authorities and a larger role reserved for those of the individual States. Following this view on federalism, Republicans often take a less expansive reading of congressional power under the Commerce Clause, such as in the opinion of William Rehnquist in United States v. Lopez. Many Republicans on the more libertarian wing wish for a more dramatic narrowing of Commerce Clause power by revisiting, among other cases, Wickard v. Filburn, a case that held that growing wheat on a farm for consumption on the same farm fell under congressional power to \\"regulate commerce ... among the several States\\". President George W. Bush was a proponent of the unitary executive theory and cited it within his Signing statements about legislation passed by Congress. The administration's interpretation of the unitary executive theory was called seriously into question by Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, where the Supreme Court ruled 5‚Äì3 that the President does not have sweeping powers to override or ignore laws through his power as commander in chief, stating \\"the Executive is bound to comply with the Rule of Law that prevails.\\"[ Opinion of the court, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, p. 72] Following the ruling, the Bush administration sought Congressional authorization for programs started only on executive mandate, as was the case with the Military Commissions Act, or abandoned programs it had previously asserted executive authority to enact, as in the case of the National Security Agency domestic wiretapping program. States' rights Ideologically, the GOP typically supports a smaller federal government. Historically, this translated into keeping power in the hands of powerful state governments, as in the cases of civil rights, abortion laws, regulations on marriage, and mapping of voting districts.Merle Black and Earl Black, The Rise of Southern Republicans (2003) However, some conservatives in recent years have demanded federal intervention to oppose state laws with respect to the Federal Marriage Amendment, the Terri Schiavo case, the Kelo case regarding eminent domain, and in cases involving assisted suicide laws and medical marijuana. To a certain extent, this is contingent upon the faction in question. For example, the paleoconservative and social conservative factions would be far more inclined to favor federal drug regulations trumping states rights, while the libertarian faction would be more inclined to see such power devolved to the states or even further. Environmental policies Historically, more progressive leaders in the Republican party supported environmental protection. For example, Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the modern National Park Service. Republican President Richard Nixon was responsible for establishing the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. In 2006, Arnold Schwarzenegger, then the Republican Governor of California, signed into law a set of carbon emission regulations that were the country's first cap on greenhouse gases, and included vehicle emissions standards higher than those of the Federal Government. These regulations were opposed by the Bush administration. President George W. Bush publicly opposed ratification of the Kyoto Protocols on the grounds that they unfairly targeted Western industrialized nations such as the United States while favoring major polluters such as China and India. In 2000, the Republican Party adopted as part of its platform support for the development of market-based solutions to environmental problems. According to the platform, \\"economic prosperity and environmental protection must advance together, environmental regulations should be based on science, the government's role should be to provide market- based incentives to develop the technologies to meet environmental standards, we should ensure that environmental policy meets the needs of localities, and environmental policy should focus on achieving results processes.\\" The Bush administration, along with several of the candidates that sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, supported increased Federal investment into the development of clean alternative fuels, increased nuclear power, as well as fuels such as ethanol, as a way of helping the U.S. achieve energy independence, as opposed to supporting less use of carbon dioxide- producing methods of generating energy. The Republican party rejects cap-and- trade policy. Some Republicans support increased oil drilling in protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a position that has drawn sharp criticism from some activists. Republicans are deeply divided over the human causes of climate change and global warming. Since 2008, many members of the Republican Party have been criticized for being anti-environmentalist and promoting climate change denial in opposition to the general scientific consensus, making them unique even among other worldwide conservative parties. Younger Republicans express higher levels of concern about climate change. When the College Republican National Committee proposed an anti-carbon tax resolution at its 2019 annual meeting, 25 presidents of state-wide college Republican groups responded by forming \\"an advocacy organization to lobby Congress for conservative solutions to the climate crisis.\\" Green conservatism manifested itself as a movement in groups such as ConservAmerica, which seeks to strengthen the Republican Party's stance on environmental issues and support efforts to conserve natural resources and protect human and environmental health. Social policies The Republican Party is generally associated with social conservative policies, although it does have dissenting centrist and libertarian factions. The social conservatives want laws that uphold their traditional values, such as opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion, and marijuana. Most conservative Republicans also oppose gun control, affirmative action, and illegal immigration. =Abortion and embryonic stem cell research= A majority of the party's national and state candidates are at the very least moderately anti-abortion and oppose elective abortion on religious or moral grounds. However, many hold exceptions in the case of incest, rape or the mother's life being at risk while others may accept early stage abortions (firmly opposing \\"partial birth\\" abortion still). When Congress voted on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003, Congressional Republicans voted overwhelmingly to support the ban. Although Republicans have voted for increases in government funding of scientific research, some members actively oppose the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of human embryos, while arguing for applying research money into adult stem cell or amniotic stem cell research.Stem cells: What they are and what they do. MayoClinic.com (2013-03-23). Retrieved on 2013-07-15.Watson, Stephanie. (2004-11-11) HowStuffWorks \\"Embryonic Stem Cells\\". Science.howstuffworks.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-15. FAQs [Stem Cell Information]. Stemcells.nih.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-15. The stem cell issue has garnered two vetoes on research funding bills from President Bush, who said the research \\"crossed a moral boundary\\". The text of the 2012 party platform specifically stated that \\"the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.\\" It also opposed using public revenues to promote abortions, to perform them, or to fund organizations that do either such things.GOP OKs platform barring abortions, gay marriage retrieved 31 October 2012 Not all Republicans support abortion restrictions and the human life amendment. Though anti-abortion planks have been part of the party platform since 1976., before 1988 there was little difference between Republicans and other voters regarding abortion, and in 2015, 40 percent of Republicans supported legal abortion. Despite their divergence from the party platform, pro-abortion rights Republicans are unlikely to switch parties. Pro-abortion rights ideology has been present in the Republican Party since before the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, and the pro-abortion rights ideology is still present today. According to some pro-abortion rights Republican groups, the Republican belief in limited government and individualism should extend to social issues, such as abortion rights. Research indicates that supporters of pro-abortion rights Republican organizations are motivated by libertarianism. Supporters of pro- abortion rights organizations may hold less conservative views on abortion, but tend to hold relatively conservative views on other political issues. Pro- abortion rights ideology and support for abortion rights ranges. The 1992 American National Election study asked respondents about their support for the legal rights of abortion. Respondents either believe abortion should only be allowed in cases of rape, incest, and to save the mother's life, abortion should be allowed if there is a \\"clear need,\\" or that abortion should not be restricted in any way. There are several organizations and Political Action Committees that support pro-abortion rights republican candidates. The most prominent are Republican Majority for Choice, Republicans for Choice, and The Wish List. These organizations provide money, endorsements, and training to candidates who support abortion rights. Republican Main Street Partnership has shown support for pro-abortion rights legislation. The Republican Party's shift to an anti-abortion stance was a gradual change and was not caused by one election or event. 1970s and 1980s Early abortion laws only allowed the procedure when the woman's life was in danger. At this time many Republicans and Democrats as well were for less strict abortion laws. Between 1974 and 1978, studies showed that political ideology had a very weak correlation with support for abortion rights. The correlation between political party identification and support for abortion rights was even weaker. Mary Louise Smith, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee from 1974 to 1977, was pro-abortion rights. Justice Blackmun wrote the Supreme Courts decision on Roe v. Wade. Blackmun had been conservative Justice appointed by President Nixon, who came out against abortion. After Roe v. Wade, though, Blackmun gradually evolved into a liberal. Some say this issue was the symbolic move of Blackmun to becoming a liberal. During his presidency, President Gerald R. Ford took a moderately conservative stance on abortion, despite First Lady Betty Ford's urges for him to take a liberal stance on the issue. Ford believed abortions should be allowed in certain circumstances, such as rape and incest, and opposed a human life amendment to the Constitution. After winning the primary, Ford stated he was also unconditionally anti-abortion and fully supported the Republican platform in 1976. Still, Ford later stated that he was pro-abortion rights after he had left office and Betty Ford was supportive of the decision made by the court in Roe v. Wade. The 1976 Republican Party Platform was the first to include an anti-abortion stance. This came during the same year that the Hyde Amendment Was passed. Ronald Reagan's run in the primary for the nomination played a role in getting an anti abortion plank along with some other positions on other issues into the platform. Democrat and Republican Party elites and elected officials became more divided on the issue of abortion in the 1980s. Still, Ronald Reagan ran and won the election in 1980, stating he was against all abortions except for saving the life of the mother. He firmly supported Roe v. Wade being overturned and a constitutional amendment banning abortion. Robert Dole, who ran in the primary for president in 1980, also firmly opposed abortion. George H.W. Bush, who also ran in the primary, was firmly pro- abortion rights. Bush wound up being Reagan's vice presidential running mate and after that, he distanced himself from that issue. It was not until after Republicans in Congress started consistently voting against abortion in the 1980s that polls showed Republican opposition to abortion. 1990 to Current Until 1988 there was little difference in pro-abortion rights attitudes among Democrat and Republican voters. Also, George H.W. Bush, shifted his position on abortion. He stated after some reflection he came to the conclusion abortion was morally wrong and should only be legal for rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. He also chose Dan Quayle as his running mate who also opposed abortion. Bush stated his position evolved while he was vice president. While running, Bush promised strict constructionist judges (Like Reagan, Ford, and Nixon all promised) who interpret not make laws. This is considered code language for overturning Roe Vs Wade. Bush did state though he would not use abortion as a litmus test for judges (like Reagan did). Though Bush did appoint one anti Roe judge (as did Reagan and Nixon though Nixon's appointments were made prior to abortion becoming an issue) During the 1992 election, President Bush and Vice President Quayle tended to downplay the importance of abortion during the election so they would not risk turning away Republican voters who supported abortion rights. A substantial number of Pro-abortion rights republicans in the 1992 election did not vote for President Bush because of his stance on abortion. Most of these pro-abortion rights Republicans voted for Perot. While President Bush and the Republican Party took an anti-abortion stance in 1992, First Lady Barbara Bush stated that she believed abortion to be a \\"personal choice.\\" In an interview in 2001, First Lady Laura Bush stated that she believed Roe v. Wade should not be overturned and later stated that abortion should remain legal because she believes \\"it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons.\\" George W Bush though stated he was still anti-abortion and while he would be appointing conservative judges abortion would not be used as a litmus test. In 2005, The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act was passed by congress with the help of the Republican Main Street Partnership. However, President George W. Bush vetoed this legislation in 2006. After the 2012 election, Senator John McCain, who is anti-abortion, advised his fellow Republicans to \\"leave the issue [abortion] alone.\\" He warned against going beyond stating one's anti- abortion belief and actions could hurt the Republican party with women voters and young voters. Like Bush I & II, Dole, Reagan, and Ford, McCain promised conservative constructionist judges but again stated he would not use abortion as a litmus test. Mitt Romney as governor of Massachusetts was firmly pro- abortion rights but he became anti-abortion running for president in 2012 and stated the same thing about conservative judges but not using abortion as a litmus test. In 2016, though Donald Trump abruptly shifted his position on abortion. For decades as a Democrat and independent he was firmly pro-abortion rights. When he began running for president in 2015, he also was pro-abortion rights. But as it seemed more apparent he would get the nomination, he too shifted to an anti-abortion stance. By the summer, Trump was also anti- abortion. Unlike the previous candidates, Trump made a promise during his debate with Hillary to appoint \\"pro life judges\\" to the US Supreme Court as well as to lower courts. He later had to take that statement back saying he was not even allowed to ask a judge what his personal position on abortion or any other issue was. He still affirmed he would appoint judges that interpret the law not make law and on abortion they would hopefully see it as a constitutional issue turning the rulings over to the states and overturning Roe. Trump did state he believed in exceptions of rape and incest as well as to saving the life of the mother on his anti abortion stance. =Civil rights= Republicans, especially Republican women, are generally against affirmative action for women and some minorities, often describing it as a 'quota system', and believing that it is not meritocratic and that it is counter-productive socially by only further promoting discrimination. Many Republicans support race-neutral admissions policies in universities, but support taking into account the socioeconomic status of the student. =Gun ownership= Republicans generally support gun ownership rights and oppose laws regulating guns and other related topic areas such as bump stocks and large-capacity magazines. However, recently, some moderate Republicans have started to be an exception to this. On the evening of Wednesday, November 28, 2018, President Donald Trump announced that his administration would be banning bump stocks. Some Republicans support this and some do not, causing some divide within the party. =Drugs= Republicans have historically supported the War on Drugs, and oppose the drug legalization of any kind, believing them to be immoral and wrong, and that the country should do its best to protect people from illegal drugs, and support Just Say No. More recently, several prominent Republicans have advocated for the reduction and reform of mandatory sentencing laws with regards to drugs. =Education= Most Republicans support school choice through charter schools and school vouchers for private schools; many have denounced the performance of the public school system and the teachers' unions. The party has insisted on a system of greater accountability for public schools, most prominently in recent years with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Many Republicans, however, opposed the creation of the United States Department of Education when it was initially created in 1979. =LGBT issues= The Republican platform, as of 2016, is officially opposed to same-sex marriage and other LGBT rights. Groups advocating for LGBT issues inside the party include the Log Cabin Republicans, Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry, and College Republicans. In the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that ended bans on same-sex marriage nationwide, the Republican Party is divided as to whether to accept the ruling or to fight it by measures such as a possible amendment to the Constitution. Individuals such as 2016 Presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Scott Walker have supported an amendment to re-expand government and re-ban same-sex marriages, while other Republican figures such as Jeb Bush (also a 2016 Presidential candidate) have disagreed. The 2016 platform, however, condemned the Supreme Court's ruling and defined marriage as \\"natural marriage, the union of one man and one woman.\\" A November/December 2013 Public Religion Research Institute poll sponsored by the Ford Foundation found that Republicans are divided in their perceptions of their own party: 45% think Republicans are friendly toward LGBT people, while 41% think the party is unfriendly toward them. The 1992 Republican presidential platform was the first to oppose same-sex marriage. A May 2012 poll found that 37% of Republicans supported a constitutional amendment defining marriage between a man and a woman. A November/December 2013 poll found that 63% of Republicans believe same-sex marriage should be left up to individual states to decide. In 2017, Pew Research polling found that for the first time a majority of Republicans weren't opposed to same-sex marriage, with 48% against and 47% in favour. =Military service= Republicans, in general, tend to be more pro-military than their Democrat counterparts, however, the factions of the Republican party do not see eye-to- eye on this. Neoconservative Republicans and subscribers to other such ideologies tend to advocate for more interventionist foreign policies, a bigger military, and using the military to promote American values around the world, while the more libertarian and paleoconservative factions of the party advocate for non-interventionism. Libertarian Republicans call for less government spending on defense,http://libertarianpapers.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/09/post/2017/09/lp-9-2-3-1.pdf but paleoconservatives usually are pro-strong national defense, and therefore sometimes are in favor of more defense spending. The 1992 Republican Party platform adopted support for continuing to exclude homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline. The support for the exclusion of homosexuals from military service would remain in the Republican Party platform until the 2012 Republican Party platform, which removed that language from it. A May 2012 United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll found that only 41% of Republicans supported restoring the prohibition against gays serving openly in the military. =Anti-discrimination laws= The 1992 Republican Party Party platform adopted opposition to including sexual preference into anti-discrimination statutes. The 2000 Republican Party platform included the statement: \\"We support the First Amendment right of freedom of association and stand united with private organizations, such as the Boy Scouts of America, and support their positions.\\" The 2004 Republican Party platform removed both parts of that language from the platform and stated that the party supports anti-discrimination legislation. The 2008 and 2012 Republican Party platform supported anti-discrimination statues based on sex, race, age, religion, creed, disability, or national origin, but both platforms were silent on sexual orientation and gender identity. A November/December 2013 Public Religion Research Institute poll sponsored by the Ford Foundation found that 61% of Republicans support laws protecting gay and lesbian people against employment discrimination, with only 33% opposing such laws. A 2007 Gallup poll showed 60% of Republicans supported expanding federal hate crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity, with only 30% opposing such laws. =Foreign aid= The 2012 Republican Party platform opposes the Obama administration from attempting to impose what it considers a \\"cultural agenda\\", including a \\"homosexual rights agenda\\" in other countries by restricting foreign aid. However, Republicans themselves have also frequently advocated for restricting foreign aid as a means of asserting the national security and immigration interests of the United States. =Civil Rights ‚Äî United States Citizens in Puerto Rico= The 2016 Republican Party Platform declares: \\"We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state. We further recognize the historic significance of the 2012 local referendum in which a 54 percent majority voted to end Puerto Rico's current status as a U.S. territory, and 61 percent chose statehood over options for sovereign nationhood. We support the federally sponsored political status referendum authorized and funded by an Act of Congress in 2014 to ascertain the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico. Once the 2012 local vote for statehood is ratified, Congress should approve an enabling act with terms for Puerto Rico's future admission as the 51st state of the Union\\". Foreign policy and national defense Republicans supported Woodrow Wilson's call for American entry into World War I in 1917, complaining only that he was too slow to go to war. Republicans in 1919 opposed his call for entry into the League of Nations. A majority supported the League with reservations; a minority opposed membership on any terms. Republicans sponsored world disarmament in the 1920s, and isolationism in the 1930s.Alex Goodall, \\"US Foreign Relations under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover,\\" in Katherine A.S. Sibley, ed., A Companion to Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover (2014) pp: 53‚Äì76 online. Most Republicans staunchly opposed intervention in World War II until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. By 1945, however, internationalists became dominant in the party which supported the Cold War policies such as the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and NATO. =Neoconservatives= Many intellectual liberal Democrats in the 1960s and 1970s who became disenchanted with the leftward movement of their party often became \\"neoconservatives\\" (\\"neocons\\").Justin Va√Øsse, Neoconservatism: The biography of a movement (Harvard UP, 2010) pp. 6‚Äì11. Many became politically prominent during the five presidential terms under Reagan, and the father-son presidency from the Bush family. They played a major role in promoting and planning the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, while not identifying themselves as neoconservatives, listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy, especially the defense of Israel, the promotion of democracy in the Middle East, and the buildup of American military forces to achieve these goals. Neocons show a preference for unilateral American activism, along with skepticism regarding the United Nations. The neocons had little influence in the Obama White House, but neoconservatism remains a staple in Republican Party arsenal. =Public opinion on foreign policy= In June 2014 the Quinnipiac Poll asked Americans which foreign policy they preferred: :A) The United States is doing too much in other countries around the world, and it is time to do less around the world and focus more on our own problems here at home. B) The United States must continue to push forward to promote democracy and freedom in other countries around the world because these efforts make our own country more secure. Democrats chose A over B by 65%-32%; Republicans chose A over B by 56% to 39%; Independents chose A over B by 67% to 29%.See \\"July 3, 2014 ‚Äì Iraq ‚Äì Getting In Was Wrong; Getting Out Was Right, U.S. Voters Tell Quinnipiac University National Poll\\" Quinnipiac University Poll item #51 =Policies= As a result, some in the Republican Party support unilateralism on issues of national security, believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense. In general, Republican thinking on defense and international relations is heavily influenced by the theories of neorealism and realism, characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure, as opposed to being the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's Evil Empire stance on the Soviet Union and George W. Bush's Axis of evil. Republicans secured gains in the 2002 and 2004 elections, with the War on Terror being one of the top issues favoring them. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, some in the party support neoconservative policies with regard to the War on Terror, including the 2001 war in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The doctrine of preemptive war, wars to disarm and destroy potential military foes based on speculation of future attacks rather than in defense against actual attack, has been advocated by prominent members of the Bush administration, but the war within Iraq has undercut the influence of this doctrine within the Republican Party. Rudy Giuliani, mayor of New York at the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, has stated his support for that policy, saying America must keep itself \\"on the offensive\\" against terrorists. The George W. Bush administration took the position that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to unlawful combatants, saying they apply to soldiers serving in the armies of nation states and not terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda. The Supreme Court overruled this position in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, which held that the Geneva Conventions were legally binding and must be followed in regards to all enemy combatants. Some prominent Republicans such as John McCain, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz and Ron Paul strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which they view as torture. =History=Other international policies=Canada= Republicans support the construction of the Keystone Pipeline, which would connect the Athabasca oil sands in Canada to refineries in the United States. American and Canadian environmentalists have strongly opposed the pipeline's construction, although the Canadian government has lobbied for it. =Israel= The Republican Party generally supports a strong alliance with Israel and efforts to secure peace in the Middle East between Israel and its Arab neighbors. =Russia= The Republican party argues that with Russia, the U.S must show resilience and patience. It also argues that Russia must stop encouraging the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Republican Platform adopted at GOP National Convention Aug 12, 2000 The party stresses the common interests of the two countries, which include ending terrorism, combating nuclear proliferation, promoting bilateral trade.2008 Republican Party Platform, September 1, 2008 Leading Republicans have been split on how to respond to the Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Syria, with some advocating a more hawkish approach, and others urging a more cautious and conciliatory response. =Trade= The party, through former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, has advocated reforms in the United Nations to halt corruption such as that which afflicted the Oil-for-Food Program. Most Republicans oppose the Kyoto Protocol. The party promotes free trade agreements, most notably North American Free Trade Agreement (and its comprehensive update, the US Mexico Canada Agreement), Dominican Republic‚ÄìCentral America Free Trade Agreement and an effort to go further south to Brazil, Peru and Colombia, although some have a protectionist view of trade. =Immigration= Republicans are divided on how to confront illegal immigration between a platform that allows for migrant workers and easing citizenship guidelines, and border enforcement-first approach. In general, pro-growth advocates within the Republican Party and it support more immigration, and traditional or populist conservatives oppose it. In 2006, the White House supported and Republican-led Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform that would eventually allow millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens, but the House, also led by Republicans, took an enforcement-first approach, and the bill failed to pass the conference committee. Lately, after the defeat in the 2012 presidential elections, and considering the low percent of Latino Americans that voted for Republicans, several Republicans are advocating a friendlier approach to immigrants. Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez is promoting the creation of a SuperPAC for immigration reform. Proposals calling for systematic reform of the U.S. immigration system such that residents that have come into the U.S. illegally have a pathway to legal citizenship have attracted broad Republican support in some polls. For example, the Public Religion Research Institute found in late 2013 that 60% of Republicans supported the pathway concept, compared to 63% of Americans as a whole.

Born in Brick Church in Giles County, Tennessee, Rothrock grew up Trenton, Tennessee. She was the youngest of five children of John Rothrock, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Utopia (Herron) Rothrock. She attended public schools in Milan, Tennessee, and Somerville, Tennessee, and the Ward Seminary in Nashville. She graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1912 with a Master of Science degree, and the New York School of Library Science in Albany in 1914. While in New York, she worked as an assistant at the New York State Library.

In 1916, Knoxville businessman and philanthropist Calvin M. McClung persuaded her to move to Knoxville to be Chief Librarian of the Lawson McGhee Library. She served in that position until 1933. During her tenure, she oversaw the establishment of the branch system that would later evolve into the Knox County Public Library system. She was also instrumental in persuading McClung to donate his personal collection to the library system, creating the Calvin M. McClung Historical Collection. This collection provided the core of the East Tennessee Historical Society (ETHS), of which Rothrock was a charter member.

Laser Ablation works by heating up a substance enough to allow gaseous material to eject, either through sublimation (solid to gas) or vaporization (liquid to gas). For most asteroids this process occurs between temperatures in the range of . The ejecting material creates a thrust, which over an extended period of time can change the trajectory of the asteroid. As a proof of concept on a small scale, Travis Brashears, a researcher at UC Santa Barbara's Experimental Cosmology Lab, led by Dr. Philip Lubin, has already experimentally verified that laser ablation can de-spin and spin-up an asteroid. Further testing and development of this method are being done by groups at UC Santa Barbara, NASA and the University of Strathclyde.  Necessity for asteroid deflection  Modern humans, or Homo sapiens, have existed for approximately 200,000 years. By comparison, the dinosaurs survived on Earth for over 100 million years before the Chixculub asteroid wiped them out. Asteroids could still potentially pose a serious threat to every major city on earth and even to our whole species. = Chelyabinsk meteor = February, 2013, the Chelyabinsk Meteor exploded at a height of 30 kilometers over western Russia. The meteor, which weighed around , was estimated to be traveling and entered Earth's atmosphere at an angle of 20 degrees. The explosion was between 20-30 times stronger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima; the resulting shock wave broke windows on the ground and injured around 1,500 people. Due to the meteor's relatively shallow angle it exploded high in Earth atmosphere. However, had the meteor reached Earth's surface or exploded lower in the atmosphere the results could have been catastrophic. = Detection = Despite NASA's efforts to detect Near Earth Objects (NEO's), the Chelyabinsk Meteor went undetected. In recent years, NASA, in partnership with the European Space Agency, have been increasing their efforts to track all NEO's with the potential to cross Earth's orbit. On their website, NASA has a public list of all known NEO's which present a potential impact risk. However, the list remains incomplete and the question of what to do in the event of an imminent impact remains unanswered. = Politics of deflection = Laser Ablation is a promising method because it allows an asteroid to be redirected without breaking the asteroid into smaller pieces, each of which may pose its own threat to Earth. The nuclear impactor is another proposed method for deflecting asteroids, but is less promising than laser ablation for both political and technical reasons: * Blowing up an asteroid could create multiple smaller asteroid fragments, which could each be as destructive as the larger asteroid. * Detonating an atomic bomb high up in Earth's atmosphere could produce unforeseen repercussions. * The Outer Space Treaty is a cold war treaty signed in 1967 which prohibits weapons of mass destruction from being placed in space. It effectively blocks any research group from experimentally verifying the nuclear impactor method. Laser ablation is already being experimentally tested in labs as a method for asteroid deflection and there are plans to begin testing on the International Space Station (ISS), and in low earth orbit. = Asteroid impact avoidance = Short acting laser ablation is used, to verify and explore, the effectiveness of the powerful thermal X-ray pulse that would be emitted upon the detonation of an asteroid stand-off nuclear explosive device. Investigations to this end were conducted in 2015 by exposing common meteorite fragments to tuned laser pulses, provided by Sandia National Laboratory.How to Stop a Killer Asteroid When a civilization-ending space rock bears down on us, this nuclear option might just save our species. 2015  In operation  # A laser array is focused on the target asteroid. # The laser heats the surface of the asteroid to extremely high temperatures: . # Material on the surface of the asteroid begins to sublimate (the rock and/or metal transitions from solid to gas) and ejects away from the asteroid. # Newton's third law states that for any action there is an equal and opposite reaction. As the material becomes a gas it is pushed away from the asteroid and by Newton's third law, it also pushes back on the asteroid with an equal force, called a thrust. # Newton's second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration, or F=ma. Although the thrust on the asteroid is tiny in comparison to the asteroid's mass, by Newton's second law there will still be some small acceleration. # Over time the small acceleration on the asteroid significantly alters its trajectory. Once the asteroid is no longer on course to collide with Earth the laser can be removed. # Deflecting an asteroid using laser ablation will likely take between 1 and 10 years, depending on a number of factors.  Proposed systems  There are two types of proposed asteroid laser ablation systems, a stand-on system and a stand-off system. The main difference is the size and position of the laser array used. = Stand-on system = A stand-on system consists of a small laser array which is sent to the target asteroid. The system would be limited to small or medium size asteroids and would require detection relatively far in advance. For a short notice threat a stand-on system would be ineffective, due to the time required to build and send the system to the target. Additionally, a new system would be required for each target. In the short term a stand-on system could be affordable and feasible; however, in the long term a larger system able to deflect asteroids of all sizes is more practical. = Stand-off system = A stand-off system is a large laser array which would orbit the Earth or possibly the moon. It would range from approximately the size of the ISS to around 10 times larger. The system would be able to deflect even the largest asteroids, which can be hundreds of kilometers across, and also ideally be able to target multiple asteroids at once if necessary. Although this system would be the most effective against a wide variety of threats, its size, and consequentially its cost, make it an unrealistic option for the near future. The implementation of this type of system would likely require the cooperation and collaboration of multiple governments and agencies.  Important factors  There are many factors which contribute to the effectiveness of an asteroid laser ablation system. Researchers have been looking at the strength of the laser, as well as, the shape and composition of the target asteroid, as two of the most important factors. = Laser strength = A stronger laser can create a greater thrust on an asteroid. Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have experimentally simulated the time it would take to redirect a moderately sized asteroid using different strength lasers. The strongest lasers tested could hypothetically require under a year to redirect an asteroid a safe distance from the Earth, while the weakest lasers could take up to 10 years. * The advantage of a weak laser is that requires less energy to power and, as a result, costs less than a higher powered laser. * The benefit of a strong laser is that it doesn't depend upon our ability to predict impacts years in advance. Asteroids are difficult to track and impacts are even more difficult to predict; a strong laser ensures greater protection. Choosing the optimal laser strength is a question of balancing the cost, energy use, and desired level of protection. = Power source= Typically such systems require substantial amounts of power. For space-based systems, this might require either some form of nuclear power, or power from a Space-Based Solar Power satellite. Many proponents of Space-Based Solar Power imagine one of the benefits of such an infrastructure includes the ability to divert asteroids and comets are alter their trajectory for exploitation via asteroid mining, as well as for laser-sail based interstellar propulsion. = Asteroid composition = Asteroids vary greatly in their composition and shape. An asteroid's composition can range from entirely metallic, to entirely rocky, to a mix of rock and metals. The composition must be taken into account since each material behaves differently when ablated. Initial trials at the University of Strathclyde have shown that laser ablation could be more effective on dense metallic asteroids, because of the shape made by the ejecting material. = Asteroid shape = In simulations asteroids have been assumed to be spherical; however, in reality most asteroids are irregularly shaped. One of the next steps for research on laser ablation is simulating how a thrust may affect the trajectory of irregularly shaped asteroids.

It is driven by a circular motion source (typically a motor of some sort) and uses a system of links with three turning pairs and a sliding pair. Quick return is a common feature of tools in which the action is performed in only one direction of the stroke, such as shapers and powered saws, because it allows less time to be spent on returning the tool to its initial position.  History  During the early-nineteenth century, cutting methods involved hand tools and cranks, which were often lengthy in duration. Joseph Whitworth changed this by creating the quick return mechanism in the mid-1800s. Using kinematics, he determined that the force and geometry of the rotating joint would affect the force and motion of the connected arm. From an engineering standpoint, the quick return mechanism impacted the technology of the Industrial Revolution by minimizing the duration of a full revolution, thus reducing the amount of time needed for a cut or press.  Applications  Quick return mechanisms are found throughout the engineering industry in different machines: * Shaper * Screw press * Power-driven saw * Mechanical actuator * revolver mechanisms  Design  The disc influences the force of the arm, which makes up the frame of reference of the quick return mechanism. The frame continues to an attached rod, which is connected to the circular disc. Powered by a motor, the disc rotates and the arm follows in the same direction (linear and left-to-right, typically) but at a different speed. When the disc nears a full revolution, the arm reaches its furthest position and returns to its initial position at a quicker rate, hence its name. Throughout the cut, the arm has a constant velocity. Upon returning to its initial position after reaching its maximum horizontal displacement, the arm reaches its highest velocity. The quick return mechanism was modeled after the crank and slider (arm), and this is present in its appearance and function; however, the crank is usually hand powered and the arm has the same rate throughout an entire revolution, whereas the arm of a quick return mechanism returns at a faster rate. The \\"quick return\\" allows for the arm to function with less energy during the cut than the initial cycle of the disc. = Specifications = When using a machine that involves this mechanism, it is very important to not force the machine into reaching its maximum stress capacity; otherwise, the machine will break. The durability of the machine is related to the size of the arm and the velocity of the disc, where the arm might not be flexible enough to handle a certain speed. Creating a graphical layout for a quick return mechanism involves all inversions and motions, which is useful in determining the dimensions for a functioning mechanism. A layout would specify the dimensions of the mechanism by highlighting each part and its interaction among the system. These interactions would include torque, force, velocity, and acceleration. By relating these concepts to their respective analyses (kinematics and dynamics), one can comprehend the effect each part has on another.  Mechanics  In order to derive the force vectors of these mechanisms, one must approach a mechanical design consisting of both kinematic and dynamic analyses. = Kinematic Analysis = Breaking the mechanism up into separate vectors and components allows us to create a kinematic analysis that can solve for the maximum velocity, acceleration, and force the mechanism is capable of in three-dimensional space. Most of the equations involved in the quick return mechanism setup originate from Hamilton's principle. The position of the arm can be found at different times using the substitution of Euler's formula: e^{i\\\\theta}=\\\\cos\\\\theta+i\\\\sin\\\\theta into the different components that have been pre-determined, according to the setup. This substitution can solve for various radii and components of the displacement of the arm at different values. Trigonometry is needed for the complete understanding of the kinematic analyses of the mechanism, where the entire design can be transcribed onto a plane layout, highlighting all of the vector components. An important concept for the analysis of the velocity of the disc relative to the arm is the angular velocity of the disc: \\\\omega=\\\\frac{v}{r} If one desires to calculate the velocity, one must derive the angles of interaction at a single moment of time, making this equation useful. = Dynamic Analysis = In addition to the kinematic analysis of a quick return mechanism, there is a dynamic analysis present. At certain lengths and attachments, the arm of the mechanism can be evaluated and then adjusted to certain preferences. For example, the differences in the forces acting upon the system at an instant can be represented by D'Alembert's principle. Depending on the structural design of the quick return mechanism, the law of cosines can be used to determine the angles and displacements of the arm. The ratio between the working stroke (engine) and the return stroke can be simplified through the manipulation of these concepts. Despite similarities between quick return mechanisms, there are many different possibilities for the outline of all forces, speeds, lengths, motions, functions, and vectors in a mechanism.

Of English and Scottish background respectively, Bartlett and Robertson met during their studies at the Royal Academy of Music in London and married in 1921. Although they initially pursued solo careers, they teamed up as duo-pianists in the late 1920s and conducted annual international tours for over two decades. Several major composers of their era wrote duo-piano compositions especially for them, including Sir Arnold Bax, Benjamin Britten, Lennox Berkeley, and the Czech composer Bohuslav Martin≈Ø. Early life and marriage Royal Academy of Music, London Ethel Agnes Bartlett was born in Epping Forest, England, on 6 June 1896. At age 10 her family moved to London. In 1915 she entered the Royal Academy of Music on an Associated Board Scholarship; her younger sister Edith was enrolled as a vocalist at the Academy. Bartlett studied under Frederick Moore and Tobias Matthay at the Academy, graduating in 1919. She also studied under Artur Schnabel in Berlin. In addition to piano, she played harpsichord and chamber music. John Rae Robertson was born in the village of Ardersier in the Scottish Highlands on 29 November 1893. He was the eighth of nine children in a minister's family. He showed an aptitude for piano playing at a very young age and began playing the organ at his father's church on Sundays at the age of five. He continued to study piano as a youth and as a student at the University of Edinburgh, where he completed his M.A. in Modern Languages. In September 1914 he began studying under Tobias Matthay at the Royal Academy of Music, but was drafted in January 1915 into the English army for World War I. He sustained an arm wound at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916 and a hand wound at Ypres in 1917. In 1918 he received his army discharge and returned to the Royal Academy. He met Bartlett upon his return to the Academy, and the two were married in Marylebone, London, in September 1921. Musical career Bartlett and Robertson initially pursued solo concert careers. Bartlett had made the acquaintance of John Barbirolli at the Royal Academy of Music during the war years, as Barbirolli had been too young for the draft, and they possibly had an intimate relationship.Barbirolli's second wife Evelyn Barbirolli described Bartlett as his \\"then 'girlfriend'\\" in 1917. She became his exclusive accompanist in the 1920s. She also performed with other vocalists and as a soloist. Robertson played both with vocalists and other pianists. The two also taught at Matthay's School of Music on Wimpole Street. The couple first performed as duo-pianists on 17 June 1924 at Wigmore Hall, to mixed reviews. The Times critic wrote, \\"They have not fully understood yet that the point of playing on two pianos is not to get more sound but to work out intricate detail more clearly\\". After their two-piano recital on 15 August 1924, The Times applauded their performance for its \\"great zest, as though they really enjoyed every note of the contrapuntal figuration\\". They achieved fame in the United States and Europe in the 1930s and 1940s as the \\"foremost two-piano team\\". By the mid-1940s, they were appearing in over 100 concerts a year, and had toured the United States, Canada, South America, and South Africa. In addition to their annual international concert tours, they played several seasons with the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, Washington National Symphony Orchestra, and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. In July 1940 they played before 35,000 listeners at the Hollywood Bowl. They also appeared on radio, playing, for example, Robertson's arrangement of Liebestr√§ume No. 3 by Liszt on The Bell Telephone Hour national broadcast on 6 July 1942. Repertoire and recordings A 1937 concert advert In a 1935 interview, Bartlett explained that when she and Robertson began their duo- piano partnership, they were the first piano duo in England and consequently had to search extensively for appropriate music. \\"We have discovered things so old that they were brand-new to audiences\\", she said. The couple also commissioned pieces from the major composers of their day. They commissioned five compositions from Sir Arnold Bax, the most famous being his Sonata for two pianos (1929) which they premiered in London on 10 December 1929. Benjamin Britten composed three pieces for them: Introduction and Rondo alla Burlesca (1940), Scottish Ballad, Op. 26 (1941), and Mazurka Elegiaca, Op. 23, No. 2 (1941). Lennox Berkeley dedicated his Polka for two pianos, Op. 5, to them; they performed it in a 1934 recital for Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1944 they commissioned a two-piano concerto from B√©la Bart√≥k, but he did not live to compose it. Czech composer Bohuslav Martin≈Ø wrote Three Czech Dances (1949) for them; they premiered the duo-piano work in Edinburgh in September 1949. Bartlett and Robertson initially signed with the National Gramophonic Society. In 1930 they signed with His Master's Voice, for which they recorded Bach's Concerto in C for two keyboards, BWV1061; Saint-Sa√´ns' Variations on the trio from the minuet; Beethoven's Sonata in E Flat, Op. 31, No. 3; and the waltz from Arensky's Suite, Op. 15. In 1939 they began recording exclusively for Columbia Masterworks Records, producing recordings such as Schumann's Andante and variations, Debussy's En blanc et noir, and Elizabethan Suite (1945), arranged by Bartlett. Technique Bartlett and Robertson were often praised for their unity of thought and execution. At their first appearance in Montreal in 1936, a reviewer for the Montreal Gazette expressed it thus: \\"The playing of Bartlett and Robertson is unique in that one thinks while hearing them, not of two people at two pianos, but of four hands at a double keyboard controlled by a single mind\\". A reviewer of their 1936 recital at the Orpheum Theatre in New York wrote: > From their first notes they brought to the audience an impression of > absolute synchronization and harmony of thought and concept. Their muscular > coordination was as though under one kinesthetic control. ‚Ä¶ it is true also > that each artist brought a completely different personality to the music. > Our great two-piano concert performers have in the past usually been men. > The very feminine qualities of interpretation which Miss Bartlett possesses > were fused with Mr. Robertson's conception of the music in a very fresh and > charming manner. Other activities Regarded as \\"one of England's most beautiful women\\", Bartlett was a favourite portrait subject for both Harold Knight and his wife, Dame Laura Knight, who painted her numerous times over a period of 20 years from the time she was a teenager, and showed her portraits in their exhibitions. A good example is on display at the Atkinson Art Gallery and Library. Bartlett also designed her own clothes for the duo's concerts. Later life The couple owned a home in Escondido, California, at which Britten was a guest in 1941. They moved to the United States permanently in the 1950s. Robertson died in Los Angeles on 5 November 1956 at the age of 63. Bartlett taught piano in her later years. She died in Los Angeles on 17 April 1978, aged 81. The Bartlett and Robertson Collection, including press clippings, personal photographs, and letters, is housed at the Royal Academy of Music in London.

Heat stress can result in heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, hyperthermia, heat exhaustion, heat cramps or heat rashes. Although heat exhaustion is less severe, hyperthermia is a medical emergency and requires emergency treatment, which if not provided can even lead to death. Heat stress causes illness but also may account for an increase in workplace accidents, and a decrease in worker productivity. Worker injuries attributable to heat include those caused by: sweaty palms, fogged-up safety glasses, and dizziness. Burns may also occur as a result of accidental contact with hot surfaces or steam. In the United States, occupational heat stress is becoming more significant as the average temperatures increase but remains overlooked. There are few studies and regulations regarding heat exposure of workers.  Risk factors  Heat- related illnesses from occupational heat stress have several risk factors. Some of these factors include high temperatures, humidity, radiant heat sources, limited air movement, metabolic heat from physical exertion of energy, not drinking enough fluids, personal protective equipment and clothing, physical condition and health problems, medications, pregnancy, lack of acclimatization, advanced age, having a previous heat-related illness and others. Construction Worker  Examples of high risk occupations  Workers in many occupations are at high risk for exposure to heat stress. Some of the higher risk occupations include firefighter, bakery worker, miner, military personnel, construction worker, factory worker, boiler room worker, landscaper, some athletes and agricultural worker.  Symptoms of heat stress  The main symptoms of heat stress are perspiration, increased heart rate, and dehydration. Other general symptoms include painful muscle cramps, extreme weakness, nausea, dizziness, headache, breathing fast and clammy, pale, cool, and/or moist skin or red, dry skin.  Prevention  Employers can establish prevention programs, which focus on having protocols to gradually increases workloads and concede on allowing on more breaks for new hired workers. Employers can control heat stress through engineering controls, work practices, providing training, implementing an acclimatization schedule, providing water and encouraging workers to drink often, and ensuring workers take appropriate rest breaks to cool down.  Occupational standards = International = International Organization for Standardization helps set standards for monitoring environments, analyzing data, and interpreting results. = United States = Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 declares that \\"Each employer shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.\\" The Mine Safety and Health Administration provides guidelines and recommendations to employers for preventing heat stress among workers. There guidelines and recommendations are not enforced regulations, but instead completely voluntary. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research on occupational hazards such as heat stress in order to provide better intervention methods and protect workers. Only three of the fifty states have created worker regulations regarding heat: California, Washington, and Minnesota. California Code of Regulations states that employers of high risk outdoor workers are entitled to protection against heat. The employer must provide access to water and shade, practice high heat procedures, practice emergency response procedures, and practice acclimatization methods. Washington State Legislature states that employers of high risk outdoor workers follow regulations to prevent heat stress. Minnesota Administrative Rules state that indoor ventilation and temperature are regulated to prevent heat stress.  Recommended standards  \\"Protect Your Workers From Heat Stress\\", CDCBeginning in 1972, NIOSH published a recommended standard for hot work environments, and has periodically revised to take new scientific findings into account. The intent of the NIOSH Recommended Standard for Occupational Exposure to Heat and Hot Environments is to prevent injury, disease, death, and reduced productivity. The recommendations include workplace limits and surveillance, medical monitoring, surveillance of heat- related sentinel health events, posting of hazardous areas, protective clothing and equipment, worker information and training, control of heat stress, and record keeping. = Control of heat stress = Control of heat stress has recommended general requirements, engineering controls, work and hygienic practices, and a heat alert program.  General Requirements  NIOSH recommends that every employer should create and implement a written program aimed at reducing heat exposures. Engineering and work practice controls should be used to reduce exposures, and a heat alert program should be implemented.  Engineering Controls  Air temperatures should be reduced so it does not exceed skin temperatures. Radiant heat should be reduced by creating barriers around the source. Evaporative heat loss can be increased by increasing air movement around the worker.  Work and Hygienic Practices  The time workers spend in hot environments should be limited, with an increase of recovery time spent in cool environments. Use of more efficient procedures and tools is beneficial to reducing metabolic demands of the job. Heat tolerance may be increased by implementing a heat tolerance plan and increasing physical fitness. Employees should be trained to recognize and treat the early signs and symptoms of heat illnesses, and employers should provide cool water for employees.  Heat Alert Program  Heat alert programs should be developed for implementation when hotter than normal temperatures, or a heat wave occurs.

The text is attached to the Samaveda, and is one of the 20 Sannyasa (renunciation) Upanishads. Sometimes just referred to as Sannyasa Upanishad, it is a highly damaged, corrupted text that exists in very different versions. Its style within each manuscript also varies, mixing prose and poetic verses. In some manuscripts, local titles are prefixed with terms such as Laghu (minor, shorter) and Brihad (major, greater), suggesting the manuscripts were living texts that reflected local sociocultural beliefs on sannyasa. A critical edition of the Calcutta and Poona manuscripts of Sannyasa Upanishad were compiled and translated by Paul Deussen, which also is known by the alternate title Kundika Upanishad. A very different 14th- or 15th-century CE manuscript titled Brihat-sannyasa has been translated by Patrick Olivelle. Unlike most ancient Sannyasa Upanishads, the medieval Brihat-Sannyasa text translated by Olivelle, is notable for its six categories of monks, their begging habits and its manual-like list of who do not qualify to join the order of monks in a monastery. The disqualified from monasteries, according to Brihat-Sannyasa Upanishad, include criminals (homicide), people suffering from contagious diseases such as consumption (tuberculosis), crippled, alcoholics, eunuchs and others. However, states the text in verse 251, that these people may renounce, on their own, when in mortal danger. The text identifies six types of renouncers ‚Äì Kuticaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa, Paramahamsa, Turiyatita and Avadhuta. Kutichaka is the monk who retains his sacred thread, his topknot hair style, his contacts with his family members and eats at one place. Bahudaka, states the text, is the monk who is like Kutichaka but eats only eight mouthfuls a day begged in the manner of a bee (randomly from different houses). A Hamsa monk has matted hair, is like Bahudaka, but wanders and begs from houses he has not preselected. A Paramahamsa monk has abandoned his sacred thread, cut off his topknot and hair, abandoned all social and material things, begs with his hand as bowl, and is happy whether he finds something to eat or not. A Turiyatita monk eats fruits and leaves like a cow, states the text, and the days he eats cooked food, it comes from three different houses he has never visited before. An Avadhuta monk meditates all the time on his own nature, receives food from anyone who gives it to him. The text is notable for an operating manual-like presentation with a melange of subjects in a disorderly fashion, such as the rites of renunciation before becoming a monk,Mariasusai Dhavamony (2002), Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Theological Soundings and Perspectives, Rodopi, , pages 96-97 abrupt verses reminding ascetics not to speak to women, another set reminding them not to perform divine worship of any kind, never recite mantras, never take food that has been offered before idols, never accept metal objects, poison or weapons as donation, and instructions such as, The first chapter of the Sannyasa Upanishad is identical to the first chapter of the ancient Kathashruti Upanishad. The text also references and includes fragments of Sanskrit text from the medieval era Hindu text Yoga Vasistha, as well as other Upanishads. The date or author of Sannyasa Upanishad is unknown, but other than the chapter 1 it includes from Kathashruti Upanishad, the rest of the text is likely a late medieval era text. Olivelle and Sprockhoff suggest it to be 14th- or 15th-century text. Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Sannyasopanishad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 387, 569-570 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 65.

The municipality existed from 1884 until 1965. It was located in what is now the present-day municipalities of Stavanger and Hjelmeland. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Fister, where the Fister Church is located. The municipality encompassed the western coast of mainland along the Fisterfjorden plus the islands to the west of the mainland, including the western part of Rand√∏y and Halsn√∏ya. Fister Church History The municipality of Fister was established on 1 July 1884 when the municipality of Hjelmeland og Fister was divided into two municipalities: Hjelmeland and Fister. Initially, Fister had 832 residents. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the municipality of Fister was dissolved. The western part of Fister, known as the Fister islands (), (population: 246) was merged into the municipality of Finn√∏y. The eastern part of Fister which included part of Rand√∏y island and the mainland part of the municipality (population: 467) was merged with Hjelmeland and √Ördal municipalities to form the new, larger municipality of Hjelmeland. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Fister, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Fister was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms.

Dietrich of Freiberg - Berthold of Moosburg - Ioane Petritsi.\\" The major merit of his work is considered to be the original philosophical research of theoretical concepts of antique and medieval Neo- Platonism expressed in the development of new intercultural model of typological-systematic interpretation of this heritage. This intercultural model of the historical study of philosophy gained special attention of many outstanding representatives of the field. Since 2007 Tengiz Iremadze is professor of philosophy and social sciences at Grigol Robakidze University(Tbilisi, Georgia) and the director of the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the same university. In 2015 he became professor of philosophy at New Georgian University (Poti, Georgia), and is the director of the Archive of Caucasian Philosophy and Theology of the same university. Tengiz Iremadze is chief editor and publisher of number of philosophical series in Georgia and Europe. Since 2014 together with German philosophers Udo Reinhold Jeck and Helmut Schneider he publishes scientific series \\"Philosophy and Social Theory\\" (Berlin, Publishing House \\"Logos\\").Tengiz Iremadze, Udo Reinhold Jeck, Helmut Schneider (eds.): Leben verstehen (Philosophie und Sozialtheorie, Bd. 1), Berlin: Logos Verlag, 2014.  Directions of the Philosophical Research = Intercultural Context of the History of Philosophy = Already in his PhD thesis (2003) Tengiz Iremadze paid special attention to the concept of intercultural philosophy. In this work he analyzed the history of the reception of one of the central concepts (theory of thought) of outstanding thinker of late antiquity Proclus in medieval Latin West. At the same time in his study he incorporated old Georgian texts referring to the \\"Elements of Theology\\" (Ioane Petritsi\`s translation and commentary of this important work of Proclus). Here, the possibility of intercultural comparison provided especially interesting perspective, as far as both lines of development (Western European and Georgian) existed independently and did not have any reference to each other. They had only one thing in common; both of them were based on a late antique author (Proclus). Tengiz Iremadze perfectly understood that especially here, in totally different language cultures, the study of differences and similarities given in this interesting episode of the reception of Proclus\` philosophy became possible. Therefore, his dissertation includes not only the history of reception of Proclus\` philosophy. Tengiz Iremadze complexly discussed different approaches of interpretations of Proclus\` philosophy and therefore laid foundations for this field of intercultural study. For this reason his work surpasses other analyses dedicated to Ioane Petritsi, Dietrich of Freiberg and Berthold of Moosburg.Udo Reinhold Jeck: Erl√§uterungen zur georgischen Philosophie, Tbilisi: Verlag \\"Nekeri\\", 2010 (2. Auflage 2012), S. 28‚Äì29. = Caucasian philosophy = Tengiz Iremadze fruitfully developed this direction of research in his work \\"Philosophy at the Crossroads of Epochs and Cultures\\" (2013). Here, based on the concept of \\"crossroad\\" he introduced new philosophical concept. In this work Tengiz Iremadze combined historical studies and systematic analysis and developed methodological preconditions and bases of \\"Caucasian Philosophy\\". He was the first to discuss Caucasian thought in united framework and first and foremost paid special attention to those thinkers who fostered the development of philosophical relationship between Caucasian countries. This work can be divided into three parts: in the introductory reflections Tengiz Iremadze develops methodological grounds and discusses the key concept of the \\"crossroad\\" from different perspectives. In the first part of the work is given the phenomenology of the \\"crossroad\\" from the important perspective of intercultural thought: \\"[Crossroad] is a topos which can be understood as a place where different cultures, beliefs and worldviews meet and depart. [...] This is the starting point where the same and the other really meet each other. The crossroad can also become a concept designating intercultural dialogue. If the process of genuine communication and mutual understanding between individuals of different cultures and traditions is possible, then it will definitely happen at the crossroads. [...] The term \\"crossroad\\" is suitable for the characterization of Georgian philosophical and theological thought. I think that this metaphor most adequately expresses the character of Georgian thought. The latter can be understood as a topos which is a gathering of European and non-European, western and eastern cultures. The original, distinctive and unique character of Georgian thought should be sought in the process of philosophizing at the epistemological and conceptual edge, at the crossroads of various cultures, religions, and traditions.\\" In the second part of the work he discusses basic philosophical concepts [Being/Beings, Truth/Interpretation, Reception/Transformation, Individualism/Intersubjectivity, Knowledge/Wisdom], which have been not only important throughout the history of philosophy, but will also have a great value in the future. In the third part Tengiz Iremadze discusses new concepts of intercultural thought. The concept of \\"crossroad\\" also plays important role here, because it underpins new intercultural philosophical theory. Tengiz Iremadze\`s above-mentioned work provides fruitful grounds for the study of intercultural phenomena. On the one hand, here certain cultural space (\\"Caucasian philosophy\\") is outlined and clearly is indicated its connections to other philosophical cultures. On the other hand, in this work is given a theory which is in close relation with hermeneutical practices as well as with the systematic problems of philosophy.  Reception  Tengiz Iremadze\`s works gained international attention in many respects. His article on Ioane Petritsi is published in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Despite the fact, that his doctoral thesis unequivocally belongs to the history of philosophy, he later paid special attention to systematic philosophical studies. In his works he pays equal attention to problems of classical as well as of the contemporary philosophy.Tengiz Iremadze: Thinking at the Crossroads. Jerusalem and Athens. In: L.

Humphrey was a talented ballerina as a child and studied television production before working as an archaeologist for five years; during this period she also converted to Judaism. In the mid 1970s Humphrey worked as a television reporter and newsreader in Australia before presenting opera and ballet simulcasts for the Australian national broadcaster ABC. The management of ABC tried to remove Humphrey as a presenter of opera broadcasts due to her pregnancy, citing \\"aesthetic reasons\\". Humphrey pursued legal action against ABC, and the decision was reversed. Early life and ballet career Dame Margot Fonteyn in May 1957thumbleft Sonia Humphrey was born in 1947 in Cambridge, England to Australian scientists George Humphrey and Beverley Franklin. She was a talented ballerina, and was the youngest recipient of a diploma with solo seal from the Royal Academy of Dance‚Äîthe academy's highest award. She enrolled in the Royal Ballet School in London, but after a knee injury, she left the school and moved to Sydney. In Australia, she danced for the Australian Ballet before giving up dancing. Humphrey met ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn‚Äîwhom she had seen perform in London‚Äîat Sydney Airport in May 1957. A photograph of their meeting was published on the front page of The Sydney Morning Herald. Five years later they met again, when Fonteyn visited the Lorraine Norton dance studio where Humphrey was a student. Production career In 1969, Humphrey graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), specialising in technical production. She then joined an archaeological dig in Israel, where she remained for five years, and converted to Judaism. During the Yom Kippur War, she worked as a field producer for the American Broadcasting Company. In 1974, she produced its coverage of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Journalism career In 1975, Humphrey returned to Australia and applied for a job at Network Ten in a production capacity. Instead, she was offered an on-air role as a reporter for Ten's Eyewitness News, later serving as a weather presenter and a newsreader. She was the first journalist on the scene of the Granville rail disaster in 1977, and her reporting of the disaster resulted in her being poached by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to present the current affairs program This Day Tonight, and its replacement, Nationwide. In 1981, Humphrey was one of three original reporters of the ABC science program Towards 2000. With her background in dance, she also presented several simulcasts of ballet and opera performances for the ABC. In 1983, Humphrey became pregnant with her second child and the ABC's management sought to remove her from on-air roles‚Äîincluding the fifth of a series of opera simulcasts she had been presenting, the Australian Opera's production of Adriana Lecouvreur on 18 February 1984‚Äîciting what Humphrey called \\"aesthetic reasons\\" (or a \\"visual overload\\" to viewers, as an ABC arts producer had said) rather than medical ones as to why she should not present the simulcast on air whilst 33 weeks pregnant. Humphrey sought internal mediation, which failed. She then took the ABC to the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board, and the broadcaster subsequently reversed the decision. In 1985, Humphrey was the original presenter of the consumer affairs program The Investigators. She was replaced as host by Helen Wellings in a 1987 refresh of the show. Personal life Humphrey was married to Sydney journalist Nick Creech with whom she had two sons‚Äîthey divorced in 1987. In 1996, she married Vice-Admiral Ian MacDougall, whom she had met several years earlier when he was Chief of Naval Staff and she was producing and directing documentaries for the Australian Defence Force and Film Australia. Humphrey and MacDougall relocated to Marrawah, Tasmania in 2005.

Initially, the U.S. military claimed the sailors inadvertently entered Iranian waters owing to mechanical failure, but it was later reported that they entered Iranian waters because of navigational errors. The U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry, called the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif within five minutes. His call was followed by multiple other phone calls between the two ministers. The sailors had a brief verbal exchange with the Iranian military and were released, unharmed, 15 hours later. The release was hailed by the Obama administration as an unintended benefit of the new diplomatic relationship. Iran released pictures of captured US sailors. Some U.S. Republican 2016 presidential candidates such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump criticized the U.S. response to the detention, which they deemed too weak. Incident A U.S. Navy riverine command boat in the Persian Gulf in 2013. On January 12, 2016, two United States Navy riverine command boats cruising from Kuwait to Bahrain with a combined crew of nine men and one woman on board strayed into Iranian territorial waters which extend three nautical miles around Farsi Island in Persian Gulf. Patrol craft of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy seized the craft and detained the crew at a military base on Farsi Island. According to military sources, the two RCBs were on a routine transit from Kuwait to Bahrain, which serves as the home port for Task Force 56 under the Fifth Fleet. They left Kuwait at 12:23 p.m local time and were scheduled to refuel with the U.S. Coast Guard Island Class Patrol Cutter USCGC Monomoy (WPB-1326) at 5 p.m. During the transit one RCB developed an engine problem, and both boats stopped to solve the mechanical issue. During this time they drifted into Iranian waters. At 5:10 p.m. the boats were approached by the two small Iranian center-console craft followed by two more boats. There was a verbal exchange between the Iranian and U.S personnel and the officer commanding the RCBs allowed the Iranian sailors to come aboard and take control. The Iranian forces made the sailors kneel with their hands behind their heads. The RCBs reported their engine failure to Task Force 56, and all communications were terminated after the report. A U.S. search-and-rescue effort was launched leading to \\"robust bridge-to-bridge communications\\" with Iranian military vessels, wherein the Iranians informed U.S. Navy cruiser at 5:15 p.m that ‚Äúthe RCBs and their crew were in Iranian custody at Farsi Island and were safe and healthy.‚Äù By the time a search-and-rescue effort got under way (it included sending a U.S. Navy and U.S Coast Guard vessel inside Iranian territorial waters over concern U.S. sailors could have been lost overboard), the sailors were already ashore. John Kerry spoke with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at least five times by telephone. He called Zarif within five minutes. He states he \\"gave him a very direct statement about what would happen if we didn't have their release very quickly.\\" Zarif called back within 20 minutes with assurances that the sailors would be released soon and that they were being \\"well taken care of.\\" John Kerry has stated that in his other phone calls about the situation he \\"made it crystal clear\\" how serious it was and that \\"it was imperative to get it resolved.\\" The sailors had a brief verbal exchange with the Iranian military and were released unharmed along with all their equipment the next day on January 13 after 15 hours, and they departed the island at 08:43 GMT on their boats. They later were escorted by a U.S Coast Guard patrol cutter, while U.S. Navy overwatched and supported. The Pentagon oversaw the escort on high alert. The IRGC stated that they released the sailors after their investigation concluded the ‚Äúillegal entry into Iranian water was not the result of a purposeful act.‚Äù At first it was suggested that a mechanical failure in at least one of the boats led them to the Iranian waters, then it was verified that both boats returned to base under their own power. However, American military officials could not explain how they had lost contact with both of the boats. The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards naval forces claimed that the U.S. apologized to Iran for incident. However, the U.S. government has stated that no apology was made. According to the Fars News Agency on January 26, \\"the American ships were 'snooping' around in Iranian waters,\\" on the basis of the sailors‚Äô GPS data collected by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy. On January 29 Fars News Agency stated \\"it was proved that the US marines had strayed into Iranian waters only due to the failure of their navigation devices and equipment.\\" U.S. Central Command stated, \\"A post-recovery inventory of the boats found that all weapons, ammunition and communication gear are accounted for minus two SIM cards that appear to have been removed from two handheld satellite phones.\\" The statement did not account for navigation equipment. A Navy command investigation continues and more details will be provided when it is completed. Tasnim News Agency reported Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy Commander Admiral Ali Fadavi said in a February 1 parliamentary session, \\"We have extracted extensive information from their [American sailors‚Äô] laptops and cell phones,\\" and that the information can be made public if a decision is made to that effect. According to the IRGC, when the Iranian forces seized the two boats, aircraft carriers USS Harry S. Truman and Charles de Gaulle had been patroling in the international waters southeast and northeast of Farsi island, respectively, which IRGC Navy commander Ali Fadavi described it as \\"unprofessional behavior for forty minutes.\\" According to Brig. Gen. Farzad Esmaili, commander of Khatam al-Anbia Air Defense Base, after the IRGC Navy reported the capture of the U.S. Navy boats, the Air Defence switched on its missile systems and the Air Force fighter jets also scrambled. Three American F-18 fighters, a radar plane and a maritime patrol aircraft flew over the U.S. aircraft carriers and began to approach Farsi island, conducted \\"bullying\\" behavior, and refused to respond to the signals, but made a contact later when the Iranian missiles zeroed on them and realized that they had \\"less than 30 seconds to decide before Iran‚Äôs missiles are fired.\\" The U.S. Navy disciplined and/or reprimanded nine of the Navy men involved in the incident, ranging from higher commanders to sailors present on the boats.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/world/middleeast/us-navy- iran.htmlhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36678976 Treatment of American military personnel On the same day the American crewmembers were released with their vessels, Iran released a series of images and videos that, among other things, showed the U.S. Navy sailors on their knees with their hands clasped behind their heads as they were being apprehended on their vessels. Two of the videos featured one of the Americans, apparently the Navy lieutenant commanding the boats, apologizing and praising Iran's treatment: ‚ÄúIt was a mistake that was our fault, and we apologize for our mistake.... The Iranian behavior was fantastic while we were here and we thank you very much for your hospitality and your assistance.‚Äù According to Politico, these pictures and footage further \\"inflam[ed] the American debate over [the sailors‚Äô] capture, including the question of whether the U.S. had formally apologized for entering Iranian territory.‚Äù A Defense Department official said that the lieutenant's filmed apology was probably intended to defuse a potentially volatile situation. Reaction=Iran= * General Ali Fadavi receiving the Order of Fath from the Supreme Leader of Iran.Iranian Armed Forces: Hossein Salami, Deputy Commander of the IRGC said that the Americans started crying during the detention and that no country has ever captured American service members since the Second World War. Ahmad Dolabi, commander of the IRGC unit that detained the American vessels said that the U.S. Navy personnel surrendered although they had all their weapons intact. Hassan Firouzabadi, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces remarked that this latest incident may not be the last. * Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei awarded a Fath military medal to Commander of the IRGC Navy Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi as well as four others involved in the capture, thanked them for their efforts and sanctioned their actions. * Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif posted on Twitter that he was happy to see that dialogue and respect swiftly resolved the episode Iranian Islamic Revolution. * On the 38th anniversary of the Iranian Islamic Revolution, teenagers were dressed like American sailors and held in a submissive manner to simulate the arrest of American sailors. Some Iranians reacted to it via social networks by criticizing the action and calling it \\"bizarre\\" and a \\"circus\\". According to the Iranian newspaper irdiplomacy, some social media websites are blocked in Iran so these reactions are not \\"broadly representative of views inside the country.\\" =United States= * Secretary of State John Kerry thanked Iranian authorities for their cooperation, adding that \\"we can all imagine how a similar situation might have played out three or four years ago.\\" However, he later stated that he was angry at videos of U.S. sailors being used for propaganda. * According to the Obama administration, the speedy release of the sailors \\"shows the power of diplomacy and the promise of its new engagement with Iran.\\" * On February 14, 2016, U.S. Republican senator John McCain said he would subpoena the 10 U.S. sailors to testify about their brief detention by Iran if the Obama administration did not provide the findings of an investigation into the incident by March 1. * On May 12, 2016, The U.S. Navy fired Commander Eric Rasch, the executive commander of the squadron that included the ten captured sailors. * Several critiques of the US Navy emerged after the investigation was published, though few changes were made. * The Navy handed down punishments to two officers and two enlisted sailors in charge of the riverine boat crews who surrendered in Iranian waters, causing an international incident and bringing embarrassment on the Navy for the litany of errors that led to their arrest and violations of regulations while in custody.

Straddling Spot Pond Brook, the village was the site of early industrial development which later blossomed into larger factories. The factory grew to be an industrial community that has come to be known as Haywardville. It is here where Hayward and Charles Goodyear invented slickers (canvas and rubber coats) and the process of vulcanization. The factory produced a variety of rubber products including boots, pails and spittoons. There were numerous large factory buildings here during this period, a community of living quarters, some shops - or at least places to barter for goods.  Decline  Industry in Haywardville began to decline as larger, more successful businesses overshadowed those in the village. It is believed that at least four mills were using the tiny Spot Pond Brook at one time. Another possible source of decline was the rapid development of both steam and electric power. The fatal blow was the taking of Haywardville‚Äôs water rights by the communities of Medford, Malden and Melrose. By this time, the mostly deserted Haywardville was bought by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1894 as part of the effort to create a park system around Boston. It helped form the Middlesex Fells Reservation. All of the buildings from what used to be known as Haywardville were relocated to Ravine Terrace and Brook Street, both in Stoneham. The remaining lands were restored by Charles Eliot, noted protege of Frederick Law Olmsted, prominent urban landscaper. This site was instrumental in the creation of the larger Metropolitan Park System, the first in the United States.  Today  Today, only traces of Haywardville remain in the Fells. The site is accessible by trails in the Virginia Wood, part of the Spot Pond Archeological District. Trail maps are available at the nearby Botume House.

It was founded in 1909, two months after the NSW Government opened the Hotel Kosciusko at Diggers Creek, the first hotel in the Kosciusko area.KAC Bulletin (1949) April, p.8. The Hotel Kosciusko became the winter home of KAC until 1930 when the Kosciusko Chalet opened at Charlotte's Pass.Ward, G.R.T (1969) The Diamond Jubilee of the Kosciusko Alpine Club, p.65 KAC was the only ski club in the Kosciuszko area until 1920 when the Ski Club of Australia was formed. KAC pioneered ski racing at Kosciuszko in 1909 and in 1913 introduced the Summit Trophy for the fastest trip on skis, during a winter season, from the Hotel Kosciusko to the summit of Mt Kosciuszko and return (55 km).Ward, G.R.T (1969) The Diamond Jubilee of the Kosciusko Alpine Club, p.35. The Summit Trophy was the most prized ski competition in NSW until World War II. As it was the major skiing body in Australia at the time, KAC in 1919 instituted the Australian Championship, a single event, eight-kilometre cross country raceYear Book of the Kosciusko Alpine Club (1919), p.18. and continued to run this event until 1929 after which it handed over control to the newly-formed Ski Council of NSW.KAC Bulletin (1950) April, p.13. Thereafter the Australian Championships comprised four events, Slalom, Downhill, Cross-country and Jump. White's River Hut, just south of Schlink Pass near Mt Gungartan, was built as a shepherd's hut by the Clarke family in 1935.The Australian and New Zealand Ski Year Book (1935), p.24. In 1938, KAC gained permission to use this hut as winter accommodation for its members.Ward, G.R.T (1969) The Diamond Jubilee of the Kosciusko Alpine Club, p.76. The hut is no longer privately owned but is still cared for by KAC and still used by club members and is open to all skiers. In 1939, a company called Alpine Hut Club was formed to take advantage of the skiing in the Brassy Mountain area of the Main Range. The company, made up substantially of KAC members, but also including other skiers, bought freehold land just outside the Kosciuszko National Park and built Alpine Hut which accommodated 14 skiers and had its own manager.The Australian and New Zealand Ski Year Book (1940), p.39. From the 1950s onwards, the advent of new resorts at Perisher Valley, Smiggin Holes, Guthega and Thredbo, with their new systems of uphill transport, brought to an end the use of White's River and Alpine Huts for all but dedicated ski tourers. In 1948, a KAC syndicate bought an Avro Anson aircraft and began a two days per week air service from Sydney to Cooma for its members and other interested skiers.KAC Bulletin (1948) June, p.13 The service was only authorised for the 1948 winter but the syndicate continued it during the 1948‚Äì49 summer and ran afoul of the Department of Civil Aviation which then cancelled the service. This air service was the forerunner of a later commercial one by Butler Air Transport in 1956. In 1947 skiing in NSW, with the exception of Kiandra, was under the control of the NSW Government which would not allow clubs to build their own accommodation. At the time the Government owned two hotels, the Hotel Kosciusko at Diggers Creek and the Chalet at Charlotte's Pass and, between the two, a much smaller lodge, Betts Camp. The Government realised that it could not keep up with the booming post- war interest in skiing and decided to allow ski clubs to build their own accommodation. The first clubs to build were Kosciusko Snow Revellers Club in Perisher Valley (1950), Ski Tourers Association at Lake Albina (1951), KAC at Charlotte's Pass (1952) and Telemark Ski Club in Perisher Valley (1952). In 1953 a syndicate of KAC members formed the Alpine Transport Company (ATC) to start an oversnow transport service, based at Smiggin Holes, for skiers and goods in Perisher Valley.KAC Bulletin (1953) September, p.12 ATC used ex World War II M. 29 Cargo Carriers (\\"Weasels\\") with caterpillar tracks. This was the forerunner of the present Hans Oversnow Service. In 1956, KAC purchased Ibis Hut from the NSW Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission.KAC Bulletin (1956) June, p.2. Ibis Hut was an elegant stone hut overlooking Spencer's Creek and about 2 km from the Chalet at Charlottes Pass with accommodation for six people. Ibis Hut was used by members of the club for low cost accommodation but was sold in 1967 due to disuse. The original KAC lodge at Charlotte's Pass burnt down in 1963 and was rebuilt in 1964. After numerous updates the accommodation wing was completely rebuilt in 1998‚Äì99. In 1969 KAC bought its Jubilee lodge at Thredbo but sold it in 1974 and, with the proceeds bought Alpenhof lodge in Perisher Valley. Alpenhof was almost completely rebuilt between 2011 and 2013. In 1993 KAC returned to Thredbo with the purchase of Punchinello apartments thereafter known as KAC Thredbo. In 1972 KAC instituted the KAC Martini and Rossi Cross-Country Race (\\"The Martini\\") from Perisher Valley to Charlotte's Pass (8.7 km).KAC Bulletin (1972) May, p.4. The race lost its original sponsor in 1999 and is now known simply as the KAC Cross-Country Classic. It takes place in August each year and is open to people in all age groups. It is one of the most popular cross-country races in Australia.

Built in 1835 in the village of Russell, the Anglican church originally held services in both English and MƒÅori. It was also occasionally used as the local courthouse. On 30 January 1840, it was the site of Captain William Hobson's proclamation that New Zealand would be ruled through New South Wales and that he would serve as Lieutenant Governor of New Zealand. The cost of its construction was contributed to by Charles Darwin in 1863. The church was visited by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1963. The New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange and the country's Governor-General Sir Paul Reeves visited the church on its 150th anniversary in 1986. After a restoration in 2000, it was made into a tourist attraction. The church was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now called Heritage New Zealand) on 24 November 1983 as registration number 1, with a category I listing.  19th century  TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene memorial in the Christ Church cemetery In the early 19th century, Russell, then known as Kororareka, was used as a safe harbour by whalers. The land for the church was purchased in 1834 from local chiefs on the condition that MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ (non-MƒÅori) would have the same right to burial. Although Charles Darwin on his 1835 visit described the town as a \\"stronghold of vice\\", he was impressed by the then near-completed church, which he saw as \\"a bold experiment\\". Darwin, Captain Fitzroy, and other officers of HMS Beagle are recorded as contributing to the church's construction. The church was built in 1835 with a simple design and hipped roof. Initially, services were performed by missionaries who had to row across the harbour from Paihia. The first service was performed on 3 January 1836 by William Williams. During this time, services were conducted in English and MƒÅori. The church also was occasionally used as the local courthouse. Captain William Hobson, in a meeting on 30 January 1840 with both MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ, used the church to proclaim that New Zealand would be ruled through New South Wales and that he would serve as lieutenant governor. Further proceedings relating to the Treaty of Waitangi occurred across the harbour at Waitangi one week later. The church was damaged in the Battle of Kororareka in 1845 by musket and cannonballs. TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene, a MƒÅori chief who fought for the British in that conflict, is buried in the church graveyard. In the early 1870s, the church was given its current name and extended with a belfry.  20th century  In the early 20th century, Christ Church was served by vicars based at Kawakawa and from 1953 onwards, Kerikeri. In 1963 Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited the church, and in 1986 for its 150th anniversary Prime Minister David Lange and Sir Paul Reeves attended. The church was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now called Heritage New Zealand) on 24 November 1983 as registration number 1, with a category I listing.  21st century  Interior of Christ Church In 2000 the church was restored and is now also a tourist attraction. While no longer used as a parish church, it remains consecrated, and is a venue for weddings, funerals and other special services. It has been speculated that the church is the oldest building in New Zealand that is still being used for its original intended purpose. In 2018 the first Anglican ordination of a New Zealander in an openly gay relationship occurred at Christ Church.

New features in 2.0 include cross-platform support in addition to the native Linux kernel and other RADOS-powered endpoints. Adding iSCSI, the ability to connect block storage to any system, even Microsoft Windows, meant an enterprise-grade software-defined storage system was now available for every major operating system supporting an iSCSI initiator.SES 2.0 and iSCSI White Paper Features New features in SES 2.0 were the iSCSI target, encryption, simpler implementation with a Crowbar appliance used for SUSE OpenStack Cloud integration, and relationships with partners to bring Ceph to ARM-based hardware.SES 2 release announcements SUSE Enterprise Storage and Ceph recommend against traditional fault-tolerance technologies, such as RAID. Ceph provides full duplication of all data so that loss of any single copy leaves at least two others (by default) available from which a new copy can be created and clients can continue to be serviced. Because the data are duplicated in their entirety, disk-based duplication via RAID is redundant, reducing overall capacity, and is therefore not encouraged. This design also makes mixing and matching sizes and types of disks possible, and allows for commodity grade hardware to be used cutting costs on the storage environment. The presence of multiple copies of data also provides clients with the ability to achieve greater read performance by pulling data from multiple disks simultaneously. Another feature of Ceph-based storage is the ability to define, via policy, the type of storage used for different types of data. This means that data can be stored more than the default three times providing higher redundancy and performance if deemed important, and it can also be stored on faster or slower disks depending on the business needs. The policies can go as far as to define redundant storage in multiple servers, multiple racks, multiple datacenter, or on different continents, all depending on the needs of the business or system administrator. Cache TieringCache Tiering can also be used to help write performance by sending writes to cache to faster disks. SUSE Enterprise Storage 5, based on the Ceph Luminous release, broadens the scope and use cases for the SUSE Software Defined Storage solution. BlueStore, a new native object storage backend increases performance by up to a factor of two , whilst a more pervasive support of erasure coding increases the efficiency of a fault tolerant solution. Efficiency is enhanced with compression capabilities.

He is best known for his pioneering research in materials science, developing the thin film growth technique called atomic layer deposition.  Early life  Suntola was born in Tampere, Pirkanmaa, in 1943, during Continuation War. He showed interest in technology early on, building wooden replicas of second world war aircraft. In his teens his interests expanded and he progressed to radios and amplifiers.  Training and Career  In 1971, Tuomo Suntola earned his PhD in semiconductor physics from the Helsinki University of Technology. After completing his PhD, Suntola made his first industrial development while working at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, a thin film humidity sensor \\"Humicap\\" for Vaisala Oy, a Finnish company specialized in meteorological instruments. In 1974 Suntola started the development of thin film electroluminescent displays in the Finnish company Instrumentarium Oy. He introduced the atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) technology, nowadays known as atomic layer deposition (ALD), as the solution for the manufacturing of the EL-devices which required thin films with very high dielectric strength. The technology was brought into industrial production of EL devices in mid 1980s by Lohja Corporation in Finland. Atomic Layer Deposition later became one of the key manufacturing techniques in the semiconductor device fabrication. In 1987 Suntola started Microchemistry Ltd as a subsidiary of the national oil company Neste Oy to apply the ALD technology to new application areas like thin film photovoltaic devices, heterogeneous catalysts, and most importantly, to semiconductor devices. In 1998, Microchemistry Ltd., and the ALD technology, was sold to Dutch ASM International, a major supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment; Microchemistry Ltd. became ASM Microchemistry Oy as ASM‚Äôs Finnish daughter company. In 1997, preceding the acquisition of Microchemistry Ltd, Suntola started as Research Fellow in the national energy company Fortum Corporation, created via the fusion of Neste Corporation, and the national Electric Utility Company. Suntola‚Äôs activity in Fortum was focused to renewable energies and advanced energy technologies. He retired from Fortum in 2004, but continues as a Board Member in Picosun Oy, a Finnish manufacturer of ALD reactors. Dr. Suntola has many important patents on ALD technology and thin film devices. Throughout his industrial career, Dr. Suntola has kept close contact with the academic society. In 1970s, he gave lectures on Semiconductor Physics at Tampere University of Technology. Since his student times he has been interested in the philosophy of science and the foundations of physics. After a fundamental breakthrough in 1995 he has been working for a holistic view of the physical reality referred to as the Dynamic Universe. In his book, The Short History of Science, Suntola traces the development of the scientific picture of reality from antique to present day. Dr. Suntola is one of the founders of the Physics Foundations Society dedicated to the search for a deepened understanding of physical reality. Since 2015 he has also served as the chairman of the Finnish Society for Natural Philosophy.  Awards  In 2004 Suntola received the European SEMI Award \\"Honoring the Pioneer in Atomic Layer Deposition Techniques ‚Ä¶ that paved the way for the development of nanoscale semiconductor devices\\". In 2018 Suntola won the Finnish Millennium Technology Prize for his contribution to the development of information technology on the basis that \\"The extremely thin isolating or conducting films needed in microprocessors and computer memory devices can only be manufactured using the ALD technology developed by Tuomo Suntola.\\" The 74-year-old was awarded one million euros ($1.18 million). His technology is used to manufacture ultra-thin material layers for a variety of devices such as computers, smartphones, microprocessors and digital memory devices, enabling high performance in small size\\"Tech 'Nobel' awarded to Finnish physicist for small smart devices\\" Phys.org, May 22, 2018.

It is located in the Charsadda District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At least 22At least 22 killed in attack on Bacha Khan University in Pakistan, CNN, 21 January 2016 people were killed and over 20 others were wounded. Over 200 students were rescued from the premises, while the terrorists were killed by security forces. The Tariq Geedar Afridi faction of the Tehrik-i-Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, although the main spokesman for Tehrik-i-Taliban later denied and condemned the assault. On 23 January 2016, the Pakistani army laid the blame on a Taliban commander and the leader of its Tariq Geedar group, Khalifa Omar Mansoor alongside his deputy Qari Zakir.  Background  Pakistan has been affected by years of militant violence, which has seen hundreds of suspected militants killed and arrested under a crackdown launched. Education and educational institutions have been frequently under attack since Taliban took hold of valleys of Swat in early 2000s. They frequently attacked and burned schools in Swat valley during their years of hold. A young schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai strongly opposed the Taliban in her blogs. She was also attacked and seriously injured. Pakistan Army launched an operation in the valley during the time when Awami National Party (ANP) was in power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Taliban was effectively driven out of the valley in later years. Over the years, the Taliban have launched reprisal attacks on ANP leadership including Asfandyar Wali Khan, grandson of Bacha Khan. One of those attacks killed a government minister, Bashir Ahmed Bilour and only son of Mian Iftikhar Hussain, another minister. Four days before the attack, Indian defense minister Manohar Parriker passed an indirect threat to Pakistan while blaming Pakistan based elements for Pathankot attack. He said that India will respond in similar manner. A few days before the attack, authorities closed some schools in Peshawar because they believed an attack was being planned. A nearby school was attacked and 130 students were killed in 2014. A mushaira (poetry gathering) to honour Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (secular Pashtun nationalist leader after whom the university is named) may have been the target, as he opposed the Mujahadeen against the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  Attack  At 9:30 am, four men entered classrooms and accommodation blocks, opening fire on teachers and students; they were also armed with suicide vests. The attack happened as the students and faculty members gathered at the school for a poetry recital to commemorate the death anniversary of Gandhian Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. The university was reportedly not adequately secured, especially at the backside of the building, which had low boundary walls. Witnesses reported that an assistant professor, armed with a pistol, fired at the assailants. According to provincial Health Minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai, more than 30 people have been killed and over 60 wounded, including students and an assistant professor. More than 60 students were rescued from the premises. According to an army spokesperson, four gunmen have been killed. Provincial Public Health Engineering Minister Shah Farman said: \\"54 security guards were stationed at the university. Around 200 people were present in the examination hall, all of whom were rescued, and timely action by police and army has prevented large scale damage\\". The Education Department in Charsadda has announced the closure of all schools for 10 days. Adnan Khan, a canteen owner in the university saw gunmen entering the university and instructed students to remain silent and turn off their mobile phones thus as a result saved many lives.  Victims  Victims included 17 students, two gardeners, a caretaker and a professor. A later investigation revealed 21 people had been killed, mostly students at an all-male hostel. A security official said the death toll could rise to as high as 40 as army commandos cleared out student hostels and classrooms. According to reports from eyewitness students, 27 years old assistant chemistry professor Syed Hamid Hussain died attempting to defend students with a pistol. Some eyewitnesses said his actions saved lives and delayed attackers for up to 15 minutes. There were also reports of a student armed with a pistol helping Hussain. The reports are conflicting with some saying he rushed out of the classroom and some saying he was killed on the spot where he confronted the attackers. Hussain is regarded as a hero of this attack in Pakistan.  Perpetrators  The Dara Adma Khel branch of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility. The attack was believed to have been planned by Khalifa Omar Mansoor of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan's Tariq Geedar Afridi faction, after he claimed the attack through a post on his Facebook page, adding that four attackers were sent to the university. Mansoor is also the alleged mastermind of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre. Mansoor told the media that the attack was in response to a military offensive against militant strongholds. However, the group's main spokesman, Mohammad Khurasani, later said the Pakistani Taliban had not been involved. He also condemned the attack as \\"un-Islamic.\\" Some sources claimed that phone calls of attackers were traced to neighbouring Afghanistan giving an indication that attack planners were based somewhere in that country. Pakistani media Dunya News alleged that the attack commander was in contact with the Indian embassy in Jalalabad and attackers were paid 30 lac rupees by the embassy to carry out the attacks. Pakistan's former interior minister Rehman Malik also blamed Indian secret agency RAW for planning and carrying out the attacks. On 23 January 2016, the Pakistani army spokesperson said that Mansoor was the mastermind and the attack was managed by his deputy Qari Zakir. It was reported that the attackers gave stiff resistance to state security forces as they engaged in an operation to clear the university over several hours. Unnamed intelligence sources said eight to 10 attackers were inside the school and that they were between 18 and 25 years old wearing civilian clothes with their faces covered. Reactions Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was in Zurich to attend the World Economic Forum, said: \\"I'm deeply grieved over the attack, and we are determined and resolved in our commitment to wipe out the menace of terrorism from our homeland. Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif reached Charsadda to boost the morale of the security personnel and took part in the operation. Speaking from the university, former health minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai said: \\"This is a frontline province. We are fighting Pakistan's war in this province... The backs of terrorists have been broken and they are breathing their last. This stunt is an attempt to breathe life into their cause.\\" A three-day mourning has been announced in the province by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government due to the attack. Pakistan observed National day of mourning and vigil on following Thursday. The COAS shared details with the Afghan leaders based on investigations into the Charsadda attack, and informed them that the attack was being controlled from a location in Afghanistan through Afghan mobile phone by a Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) operative. According to the ISPR branch of the Pakistan Army, the COAS telephoned Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, chief executive Abdullah Abdullah and USA commander in Afghanistan General John Campbell and shared information regarding attack on the university in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Chief Minister of KPK Pervez Khattak cut his foreign tour and returned after learning about the news while provincial ministers reached the site as well. Pervez Khattak urged the federal government to take up the matter of terrorism with Afghan government and also send the Afghan refugees back to their country to improve law and order whom Pakistan have been hosting since 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Internationally, the attacks received condolences from world leaders including fellow Muslim countries, neighbouring India and most of the major developed countries in one way or another. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was poignant on justice being brought to the perpetrators.  Aftermath  The university briefly re-opened on 25 January and vigils were held, but faculty decided later that day to close the university until further notice. On 11 February, it was reported that security levels had been increased by raising boundary walls, adding barbed wire, watchtowers and increasing the number of security guards and CCTV cameras with a control room. A delegation reviewing the security recommended the campus move to a safer location near the motorway to Charsadda on a site. The university finally opened on 15 February 2016 after a closure of over three weeks. Four men were arrested, including Qari Zakir's brother-in-law, for facilitating the attackers. The Pakistani army said they had helped them procure weapons, house them and purchased the rickshaw used to travel to the university.

History=Perth Bowling and Recreation Club= The Perth Bowling Club was formed in 1895, becoming the first bowling club in Perth. The club began playing on greens on the Perth Esplanade in 1896. The greens were officially opened in April 1896 by club president John Forrest, the Premier of Western Australia. =Western Australian Tattersalls Club= Several attempts were made in the 1880s and 1890s were made to start up a Tattersalls Club in Perth before the Western Australian Tattersalls Club was established in 1901, with the Club formally registered as a company in 1903. =Merger= The two clubs agreed to merge in late 1978, with an act of parliament required to approve the merger. Venues Soon after the bowling club was founded, work began on building a facility to the north of the Perth Esplanade. As time went on, with the widening of Riverside Drive and the ongoing reclamation of the Swan River, a move east of the Esplanade began to be suggested. During the 1960s, the club took over facilities on Plain Street, East Perth that had originally been built for the 1962 Commonwealth Games, but not used.

For part of its history it totally supplanted the local Greek Orthodox episcopal administration (the mediaeval Metropolis of Argos and Nauplia, now called the Metropolis of Argolis) and at other times existed in competition with it. At various times in its history it had no incumbent bishop. It was finally suppressed in 1715 and exists now as a Catholic titular see. Frankish rule Under Frankish Crusader rule, Argos was part of the Lordship of Argos and Nauplia, and became a Latin Church bishopric in 1212. It lasted as a residential see until Argos was taken by the Ottoman Empire in 1463, but would be revived under the second Venetian rule in 1686. In the meantime, the Venetians retained Nauplia until 1540, when it was lost in the Third Ottoman Venetian War. Until then, at least some of the nominal bishops of Argos resided at Nauplia; afterwards in Venice. The Orthodox bishop returned to Argos during this interval.

It premiered on FOX on September 22, 2014 and was written by series developer Bruno Heller and directed by Danny Cannon. The episode, and the series as a whole, are based on characters appearing in and published by DC Comics in the Batman franchise, primarily those of James Gordon and Bruce Wayne. FOX gave the pilot a straight-to-series order with an order of 16 episodes. The pilot was watched by 8.21 million viewers, a strong number and received generally positive reviews for its acting and plot, but received criticism for its pace and subplots. Plot Selina Kyle (Camren Bicondova) is prowling through Gotham City. After robbing milk and pick-pocketing, she flees to an alley and hides in a fire escape. She watches Thomas (Grayson McCouch) and Martha Wayne (Brette Taylor) with their son Bruce (David Mazouz) walking through the alley as they are walking home from seeing a movie. An unknown assailant approaches them, demanding their possessions and then shooting Thomas and Martha, leaving Bruce shocked in front of his parents' bodies while Selina watches. Rookie detective James \\"Jim\\" Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and his partner, Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue) are sent to investigate the crime scene. Gordon talks with Bruce and promises to capture the killer after Bruce explains to Gordon of what happened when the Waynes' butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Sean Pertwee) arrives for Bruce. When they have no clues, they go to see Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith), an underling of Mafia Don Carmine Falcone (John Doman) but they receive no information. The next day, Bullock calls Gordon as he got a lead in the case. The suspect, Mario Pepper (Daniel Stewart Sherman) flees from the apartment and nearly kills Gordon when Bullock shoots him, killing him. During an inspection, they find the necklace and are labeled for solving the case. However, a low-level mobster Oswald \\"Penguin\\" Cobblepot gives information to Major Crimes Unit investigators Renee Montoya (Victoria Cartagena) and Crispus Allen (Andrew Stewart-Jones) revealing Mooney framed Pepper for the murder. Montoya thinks Gordon and the Police Department (GCPD) are corrupt and plans on bring them down. Realizing Pepper is innocent, Gordon confronts Mooney, only to be kidnapped. Bullock goes for him, only to be knocked out and both tied by Mooney's bodyguard, Butch Gilzean (Drew Powell). Meanwhile, Mooney confronts Cobblepot and beats him with a baseball bat for being a rat. Gordon and Bullock are saved by Don Falcone, who says Mooney should ask him first to kill a cop. He reveals to Gordon the relationship with Gordon's father and framing Pepper. To show his adherence to the corruption going on within Gotham City, Gordon is ordered by Falcone to kill Cobblepot in the docks. Gordon fakes Cobblepot's death by throwing him in the ocean, telling him to never come back to Gotham. Gordon visits Bruce in his Manor, revealing Pepper was framed and promising to find the real killer. As he exits Wayne Manor, Selina is seen on an outside wall. The episode ends with Cobblepot climbing out of a river and killing a man so he can get his sandwich. Production=Development= Bruno Heller, a fan of Batman, has been talking to DC Comics Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns to discuss a potential Batman series. According to Heller, \\"It opened up a whole world of storytelling that we realized hadn't really been looked at before, which is the world before Batman -- the world of Gotham, young Bruce Wayne, and young James Gordon and the origin stories of the villains\\". On September 24, 2013, Fox announced that it had bypassed the traditional pilot phase and placed a straight-to-series order for \\"Gotham\\", to be written and executive produced by Heller. \\"Gotham\\" received a series order from Fox on May 5, 2014, with the first season reported to consist of 16 episodes, rather than the standard 13 or 22. Fox's Chairman of Entertainment Kevin Reilly stated, \\"We were only contractually obligated to order 13, and we ordered 16, because we think that's the way that show, at least in its first iteration, will be very strong to arc to. Could we do more next season? We certainly could, but that‚Äôs where we're starting with that one. That show is going to have a very strong, serialized element\\". Speaking of the project at the 2014 winter TCA press tour, Reilly described the series as \\"this operatic soap that has a slightly larger-than-life quality. This is not some adjunct companion series. This is the Batman franchise, just backing it up [in chronology]\\". He later added that the series is separate from any DC film universe. =Casting= In January 2014, rumors arose that Donal Logue would portray Gordon in the series. Logue denied these rumors via Twitter. Logue was eventually cast as Harvey Bullock. In February 2014, Ben McKenzie was cast as James Gordon. In early March 2014, David Mazouz was cast as Bruce Wayne while Camren Bicondova was cast as Selina Kyle. On April 1, 2014, Cory Michael Smith was cast to portray Edward Nygma, the early version of the villain The Riddler. At the 2014 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, DC's Jim Cunningham said that Renee Montoya would be a character on the show. Reception=Ratings= The pilot was watched by 8.21 million viewers, with a 3.2 rating among 18-49 adults. The results were below expectations of becoming the greatest opener in the 2015 but were still strong numbers. The pilot ranked as Monday night's No. 1 drama, beating NBC's The Blacklist and new CBS drama Scorpion after three days of delayed viewing. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 14.45 million viewers, and a 6.0 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reception= \\"Pilot\\" was well received by critics. The episode received a rating of 79% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews, with the site's consensus stating: \\"Though overcrowded with introductions, the Gotham pilot sets the template for an engrossing crime drama with moody atmosphere and likable lead actors\\". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.0 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gotham, from Rome and The Mentalists Bruno Heller, kicked things off with a basic, somewhat bland, crime story filled with a few too many dog ears. Though I also understand the show's need to sell as many Batman-y elements as it can right out of the gate, considering that it'll never have the big, main ingredient people want. The story-telling almost gets hampered by the brand itself. And the sheer amount of \\"they all knew each other at one point\\" coincidences might turn some folks off. Still, Gotham does work when it spins in the opposite direction and strays from what we've become too familiar with. Cobblepot is a delicious wild card, Fish Mooney is a fun addition, and Alfred is joyfully uncouth. David Mazouz's young Bruce is appropriately mature while Camren Bicondova's Selina Kyle hops around rooftops, spying on his trauma. On the flip side, I felt like an \\"everyman\\" approach to Gordon would have served that character better than the intensity seen here. The biggest challenge for Gotham just might be whether or not all these relationships, told in long form, will wind up being more effective‚Äîor at least as effective‚Äîas what other filmmakers were able to achieve with just a few flashbacks\\". The A.V. Club's Oliver Sava gave the episode a \\"C\\" grade and wrote, \\"The chemistry between Bullock and Gordon finally clicks during their last scene together in the pilot, with Logue revealing Bullock‚Äôs vulnerability in hopes that Gordon will sacrifice his morals to save them both. This show‚Äôs fate ultimately rests in that core relationship between Gordon and Bullock, and the stronger their characters become, the better Gotham will fare\\".

Its full title was Een Bloemhof van allerley Lieflijkheyd sonder verdriet (A Flower Garden of All Kinds of Loveliness without Sorrow). The book sparked controversy in Amsterdam because of its articles defining political and religious terms, even though they comprise only a small portion of the overall dictionary. The book also offers laymen explanations for technical jargon and foreign terms, covering topics such as medicine and law. The dictionary espoused ideas associated with the radical Enlightenment and was condemned as heretical by Church authorities. In Een Bloemhof, Koerbagh criticizes the Christian concept of Trinity and questions the divinity of Christ. The dictionary's entry on Jesus claims that Jesus Christ was a mortal man who had an unnamed father. The entry on heretics and heresy lambastes the clergy for exploiting the idea of heresy to manipulate secular rulers into handing over their power to the Church. Koerbagh rejected stories of supernatural phenomena as myths meant to fool the ignorant, believing \\"nothing can happen against or above Nature.\\" He was skeptical of the existence of miracles, angels, demons, and magic. Its theological comments were influenced by the ideas of Spinoza. The Bloemhof was suppressed in Amsterdam on the grounds that it contained \\"blasphemous remarks about God, our Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and the divine and perfect Word of the Lord.\\" There was public outcry against the book. The Amsterdam consistory investigated Koerbagh and his brother for their allegedly heretical activities. The publication of the dictionary violated a 1653 law in Holland prohibiting the promulgation of Socinian and any other antitrinitarian views. Copies of Een Bloemhof were confiscated in Amsterdam. The chief police officer of Amsterdam ordered Koerbagh to remain in the city, but Koerbagh managed to escape to Culemborg where he hid using the alias Pieter Wilte. Koerbagh brought with him an unfinished manuscript for Een Ligt, schynende in duystere plaatsen (A Light Shining in Dark Places). Koerbagh had been working on Een Ligt since completing Een Bloemhof in 1667. The printing of Een Ligt began in Utrecht, but stopped when the printer became concerned about the opinions expressed in the book. The printer notified the sheriff of Utrecht, who contacted the sheriff of Amsterdam. Koerbagh fled Culemborg after being alerted of his impending arrest, but was apprehended in Leiden and brought back to Amsterdam. The authorities ordered the burning of every known copy of Een Bloemhof and Een Ligt. Koerbagh's sentence was a decade of imprisonment, a four thousand guilder fine, and a decade of banishment from Amsterdam following his release from jail.

Architecture  The church has a modern design and is constructed of red brick. The original design called for a single, large building for the main church room, a small perpendicular wing for storage and offices and a simple church tower. The tower was free standing and separated from the main church buildings. In 1986 the adjoining wing was renovated and the flat roof was made into a saddle roof with trussed rafters. In 1990 the church received a new facade of red brick, the tower was capped with a copper roof and a porch was added to the main entrance.

Two men with links to Al-Qaeda were convicted for the plot, while a third person was acquitted for terror charges. Background After investigations by Norwegian intelligence in cooperation with US and British intelligence, three men with residence in Norway were arrested on 8 July 2010 in what was described as part of the largest terrorist network uncovered since the September 11 attacks. The men were thought to be part of an Al-Qaeda cell in Norway with links to the network responsible for the 2009 New York City Subway and United Kingdom plot, and were charged with conspiracy to commit one or more acts of terrorism in Norway. The plots were thought to have been ordered by Saleh al-Somali, and to have had links to Adnan Gulshair el Shukrijumah. At least two of the suspects had regularly attended the Muslim Cultural Center in Sarpsborg, a radical mosque known for its militant views. Suspects * Mikael Davud (born Mohammad Rashidin), 39, an Uyghur from China, came to Norway as a refugee in 1999 and a Norwegian citizen since 2007. * Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak, 37, a Kurd from Iraq, came to Norway in 1999 and granted residence on humanitarian grounds. * David Jakobsen (born Alisjer Abdulaif), 31, an Uzbek, came to Norway as an asylum seeker in 2002, had his application rejected but gained permanent residence based on family reunification. Investigation and trial According to the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST), the men were thought to have planned to make bombs based on hydrogen peroxide. It was revealed that Jakobsen had contacted PST months prior to the arrest, and that he had functioned as their informant. Due to being under extensive surveillance, Norwegian police were able to replace the dangerous chemicals thought to be acquired by the cell with harmless ones. In September, Bujak confessed to having planned to bomb the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten and to shoot the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard together with Davud. All three men had changed their names in the aftermath of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. Some days later, the suspected main perpetrator Mikael Davud claimed that he had planned to bomb the Chinese embassy in Oslo as part of a personal vendetta unknowingly to the other suspects. A solo plot would notably have avoided the stricter sentencing under Norway's anti-terror laws which required a person to have entered into a conspiracy with at least one other person. On 30 January 2012 the Oslo District Court convicted Davud and Bujak for conspiracy to commit terror against Jyllands-Posten in Copenhagen or √Örhus, while dismissing Davud's claims of plans to bomb the Chinese embassy. Davud was sentenced to seven years in prison, Bajuk to three and a half years, while Jakobsen was acquitted of the terror charges. All three were convicted for having produced explosives. The verdicts were upheld following appeals to the Borgarting Court of Appeal and finally the Supreme Court of Norway, with Davud's sentence being raised to eight years.

Fage in 1921. It is one of several genera, including Telema, Usofila, and Cangoderces, whose relationship within the family and to these other genera is still poorly understood. Species it contains three species, found in Kenya, Tanzania, Malaysia, and Indonesia: A. jacobsoni, A. oculata, and A. taitatavetaensis. =A. jacobsoni= Two species of A. jacobsoni have been described, found in Sumatra and Malaysia. It is the first of the family Telemidae to be found in tropical Asia. This species is similar in appearance to those of the family Ochyroceratidae, but several features, including the simple chelicerae, colulus, and the respiratory system consisting of tracheae with four separated stigmata, show that it belongs in the family Telemidae. The first specimen was found in Malaysia, and though the morphology of the genitalia could have earned it a new genus, because the specimen was female, it was instead provisionally placed in existing genus Apneumonella, though it could also have fit in Cangoderces. A. jacobsoni is only known from a single female specimen.

Instead of being completely adapted to cave life like many species of Telema, A. oculata still retains characteristics of life outside caves, including retaining its eyes, at least partial skin pigmentation, and relatively short legs. The abdomen is white, though parts of the carapace, mouth, colulus, and some other parts are red to brown. The carapace is slightly longer than wide, truncated in the rear, and convex toward the middle, slowly sloping in the thoracic part. There are six eyes in total.

It was first published as Outsider in the House in 1997. Content A review in the British magazine Prospect finds Outsider surprisingly au courant for a reprint of a 20-year-old book, asserting that once readers get past the focus on Newt Gingrich era politics, the issues Sanders was addressing in the 90s: the negative impact of free trade on American wages, income inequality, falling working class wages, military overspending, poverty, and the negative impact of big corporation, feel contemporary. In fact, to the British reviewer, Bernie Sanders sounds just like Jeremy Corbyn, unsurprising given that both men are lifelong socialists. The book talks about Sanders's support for the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gives United States citizens the right to bear arms. Additionally, the book talks about the Republican Revolution spearheaded by Newt Gingrich. Sanders adds that the Republican Revolution works hand in hand with the Christian Coalition, whose main focus is on \\"immigrant and gay bashing\\". The 2015 reedition argues that the Republican Revolution remains relevant because \\"for Sanders, the only thing that‚Äôs changed over the past 20 years is that the bad guys have got worse\\". \\"N-word\\" controversy In 2019, a passage from the 1997 book sparked controversy after the Daily Caller surfaced the passage of Sanders mentioning the n-word to critique racism. In addition, it has been reported that Sanders also mentioned the n-word in his 2015 version as well. The Sanders campaign later defended Sanders following the controversy.

The two best known services are fraud detection and revenue assurance, typically offered to telecommunication companies. Araxxe is based in Lyon, France and was founded in 2005. Araxxe in 2015 were operational in over 150 countries, providing SMS, GSM and 3G fraud monitoring for some of the largest telecom networks globally. History The company began in 2004 by developing a billing errors detection service, which was launched as Aramis. The system was officially released in early 2005 by Araxxe SAS. The system was one of the first of its kind to really begin to thoroughly protect telecoms companies and users from telecoms billing errors. In 2007, Araxxe joined a number of companies in the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The company's aim was to contribute and work at standardizing the quality of services provided to monitor services used for Service Assurance and Revenue Assurance. The company was a major contributor to ETSI 102 845, a technical standard about billing verification developed for the European Commission as part of the 2009 ICT standardization work programme. In 2008, Araxxe became the fourteenth company in France to be awarded the ISO27001:2005, by the International Organization for Standardization. After the companies expansion to Latin America, it was predicted that their service would be made operational by 5-7 clients by the end of 2010. Black Swan Telecom Journal interviewed Xavier Lesage who founded the company in 2005, following a number of billing developments made by Apple Inc.. At the time, the United States market operated a flat rate billing process and many believed that in the future real-time charging would steadily become the norm. Due to the United States operating a fairly simplistic system up unto that point, Araxxe's CEO was asked to speak about the transition and the problems that the United States telecoms market could face. Araxxe in 2012 became an Associate Member of the GSM Association. During the same period, the company filed and is now holder of six telecom patents. By 2015, it was stated in an interview that Araxxe robots were influencing protection and monitoring systems for SMS, GSM and 3G telecoms in over 150 countries. During the same year the company received an award locally in Lyon, for its export work as an SME. Services Araxxe offers two main forms of verifications as a service. =Billing verification= The first is an End to End Billing Verification service, which is used as a form of monitoring and provides an international network of test robots. These are deployed and operated remotely by Araxxe. One example of this was based on roaming telecommunication traffic in South Africa, prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Additional robots were deployed to check the billing of clients who were attending the competition, in order to minimise fraud. =Fraud detection= Interconnect Fraud Detection is the second service, which focuses on billing and fraud detection interconnection. Fraud types include simbox, ghost trunks, trunk arbitrage, CLI refilling, SMS arbitrage and also OTT Bypass. Both services collectively protect telephone users again interceptions and fraud. They ensure that bills are charged correctly and that phone calls and messages sent between different networks remain untouched. Telecoms fraud takes place due to the overall complexity between differing systems. This typically happens due to three different pressures, value-based pricing pressure, regulatory pressure or competitive pressure. The differing price structures for effectively the same service means that charging customers incorrectly and fraud could be commonplace if systems such as this weren't operational. Due to the varying number of paths and the creation of new ones, fraud of this nature would be almost impossible to wipe out completely. With intelligent robots, it ensures that common processes are monitored, which in turn ensures fraud is minimised.

It is committed to grass roots community building together with the local villages in the Villupuram district on different development areas, namely community development, economic development, capacity building, and psychosocial support. In all those four areas, the ultimate goal is to \\"realize the inherent capability of human beings for self-empowerment [and to] provide the proper resources to build a healthy life\\". Founded in 1983, it nowadays incorporates micro finance projects, capacity building trainings and seminars, psychological and physical health initiatives, livelihood trainings and social enterprise trainings, caste integration exchange programs, and exposure field trips. Mission and values AVAG collaborates with all sectors of society to bring about a holistic and participatory village transformation where the villagers are the main acting force. AVAG sees its main role as enabling the beneficiaries to become more self-empowered. It places relationships between human beings and their behaviors, traditions and prejudices at the foundation of its programs and work with villagers, following the central goal of gender and cast equality. Solidarity and cooperation are also important values to AVAG. Structure In July 2000, the Auroville Village Action Trust developed out of AVAG's diverse activities in order to them better. Since then, AVAG is a part of this trust. Field work is carried out by a team of 6 development workers who themselves come from Vanur block and are deeply familiar with the ground realities. They receive special training and are often the direct link between the trustees and direct beneficiaries. Additionally, 2 vocational trainers and a team of 8 support staff make up the rest of the AVAG team. AVAG regularly hosts students, interns and volunteers from abroad who assist in all aspects of programs delivery. The immediate beneficiaries are the members of the women and men self-help groups (SHGs), who usually meet twice a month to discuss loans and personal issues or to receive training. Every SHG elects an animator and two representatives each month. =Programs= Eco-friendly products for villagers  A store is located on AVAG premises and provides access to affordable echo-friendly technologies suitable for rural communities, such as spirulina supplements, energy powder, CFL bulbs, activated EM, low-cost water filters, and solar-powered devices.  Social enterprise initiatives and livelihood training programs  AVAG offers a large number of trainings, and creates self-employment opportunities for members of women's SHGs. Together with the Sustainable Enterprise Development in the Auroville Bioregion (SEDAB) project, which is part of a wider Integral Rural Development vision for the bioregion, the goal is to provide sustainable livelihood options for women in villages in and around Auroville. Several different products are being produced and sold as part of the social enterprise initiative, such as clothes and accessories and crocheted life style products, like toys and lamps, and accessories (under AVAG's own brand Aval), herbal beauty products, spirulina capsules (under the brand Surya.) =Funding= AVAG has varying supporters, also relying on individual donors. The BMZ gives AVAG a notable supporting sum each year under the Verein zur F√∂rderung der Auroville-Region (VFAVR), affiliated with AVI Germany. They also supported the issue of the AVVAI scheme. Other funding partners are the Village Outreach Society of Canada and the United Kingdom, who have supported Eco Femme, AVAG's exchange programs and the solar lantern project of the EcoLife store. World Dignity, Inc. (WDI), an organization working internationally to build on the strength, resilience, culture and wisdom of all people, created the AVAG/WDI Education Revolving Fund to help financially poor club members pay for their children's higher education through loans or grants together with AVAG. Motherson Sumi Systems Limited has given a 1 Crore grant towards a project increasing access to education for poor girls in June 2015 as part of their Corporate social responsibility (CSR) program. History In 1983, AVAG was founded by Bhavana Dee Decew \\"to act as a bridge between [Auroville] and immediate neighbours.\\" At that time, a few programs with children and women were started in the villages surrounding Auroville. Gradually, professional social workers joined and turned AVAG into an official developmental project. With OXFAM India's help starting 1991, AVAG expanded its scope in terms of working areas and adjointed activities and field staff could be recruited and trained. The Commonwealth Human Ecology Council (CHEC) of the Overseas Development Agency (ODA)-UK, later called the Department for International Development (DfID), also supported AVAG so that its work expanded further. Thanks to the DfID's funding, the Women's Federation and the men's groups could also be established in 1999. When the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami hit Tamil Nadu, AVAG experienced a major financial and labor crisis. Many activities had to be reduced or shut down but it was sustained with the help of the women and men SHGs and the leaders of the villages. ACDC also supported AVAG's work in the tsunami hit areas. ACDC continued to support AVAG until 2009. In 2010, the social enterprise initiative got started with the assistance of the Sustainable Enterprise Development in the Auroville Bioregion (SEDAB), scheduled to run until the middle of 2016. The BMZ project set up a revolving fund with the German government's support, mainly for enabling the distribution of grants to poor girls for obtaining a better education. Currently, AVAG is working on setting up education programs for adolescent girls and boys and marketing its products more. Also, flood relief after the hundred-year 2015 South Indian floods in the Villupuram district is still going on. Affiliations AVAG is closely working together with people in Auroville, for certain events such as flood relief help and different entrepreneurial projects inside of Auroville. Some of AVAG's women stitch disposable cloth pads for EcoFemme, they have also recently started to assist in stitching scarves made by The Colours of Nature One different project which AVAG is working together with Auroville on right now is the Paalam project, Paalam meaning bridge in Tamil, which is a bioregional and Auroville youth leadership program and \\"aims to provide training in sustainable village development through a programme that would include exposure to Auroville and its ideals and to model village development throughout Tamil Nadu.\\" Once a year, a student from the American University of Paris (AUP) joins AVAG for a few weeks to assist it in the communications sector. AVAG is associated with the National Australia Bank, the Indian Bank and the ICICI Bank for the microfinancing and SHG loans. They send a mobile bank to AVAG twice a week and issue the loans to the SHG women. The German BMZ is supporting one or two young volunteers coming to AVAG via Auroville International (AVI) Deutschland e.V., a non-profit organization which is amongst other things a volunteer sending agency via weltw√§rts, each year for a year's duration.

Mid Dome stands above the upper reaches of the Mataura River, some 7 km south of the township of Athol. Mid Dome was the source of an experiment during the late 1960s to confront the effects of ongoing land erosion. In an attempt to reduce erosion wilding pines. The solution was effective, with the pines spreading quickly over the western slopes of the mountain.

Physical Space=Version 1: EyeNetra= Eyenetra, ceiling crashes Let's build some tables Maker‚Äôs Asylum began when the ceiling of EyeNetra‚Äôs office in Mumbai fell down and broke all the furniture. Vaibhav, a carpenter by passion, hit social media looking for like- minded people in the city to join him in rebuilding the tables for his office. On November 7, 2013, eight DIY enthusiasts turned up at EyeNetra‚Äôs office and they made 3 tables on the first day. They decided to meet every Sunday and continue to build other fun things as well. The nascent community started to volunteer their tools and soon they ran out of space in the back room. They called that room ‚Äî the Asylum. =Version 2: Bandra Garage= Vaibhav met Anool at MakerFest in January 2014. Their love for making clicked instantly. Since the backroom was running out of space, Kirti Shetty, a former co-founder of the Asylum, offered her garage in Bandra to continue our activities. The garage was Maker‚Äôs Asylum‚Äôs first official address, open seven days a week. The mission: to break and make. It was the first open makerspace in India. =Version 3: ISDI= The community kept growing in Bandra but was limited by space; 250 sqft was proving to be too small. Vaibhav tried every possible option in his search for an affordable space in a space-crunched city. Finally, he met Soumitra and Sidharth at ISDI. They offered their support and space. The Asylum found a new location in Lower Parel‚Äôs corporate district. =Version 3.1: Delhi= Vaibhav is a Delhi boy who started building tables in his basement before he even knew what the definition of the maker movement was. A few of the problems he encountered while build the table was that he had to spend more on tools than materials and found himself with no one to turn to when faced with a glitch. Maker‚Äôs Asylum, Delhi, was born to ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen to anyone else.

It has around 3,000 active members. The mosque was visited by King Harald V of Norway and Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway in 2009. Controversy The mosque has been criticised for associations with Islamism and extremism. Critics have pointed to a number of jihadists originating from the mosque, as well as mosque supervisor Ghozlan's tacit support for the Muslim Brotherhood and failure to distance himself from the views of the likes of Yusuf al- Qaradawi. Former members of the mosque includes Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a perpetrator of the Kenyan Westgate shopping mall attack who was a prolific user on a website hosted by the mosque, Norwegian convert terrorist Anders Cameroon √òstensvig Dale, the first Norwegian suicide bomber in Iraq Jamel Mahmoudi, as well as being the mosque in Norway that has housed the most Norwegian jihadists in Syria and Iraq. After being criticised for hosting hate preachers at conferences, the mosque has withdrawn its invitations to certain preachers. In 2013 a 21-year-old woman died of a heart attack in the mosque, reportedly after being subjected to an exorcism, a procedure officially prohibited by the mosque. In 2014, the mosque, which is also known by its organisational name The Islamic Association (Norwegian: Det Islamske Forbundet), was listed as a terrorist organisation by the United Arab Emirates along with mosques in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The probable cause for the listing was thought to be that the mosque was identified as being a part of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Nordic governments in a joint diplomatic action requested answers from the Emirates for the causes behind the listings in response.

Gameplay  The Deadly Tower of Monsters is a top-down shooter with twin-stick controls and melee combat elements. A jetpack can be used to reach high areas.  Plot  The Deadly Tower of Monsters follows three actors in the movie of the same name. It is inspired by 1950's science fiction movies. The game's framing device is that of an early 1970s B-movie The Deadly Tower of Monsters recently released on DVD, with the director's commentary of its in-universe director Dan Smith serving as a combination of tutorial and meta-commentary on the game, providing an explanation as to why many default elements of shooters would be in what is ostensibly a film (the player being required to break boxes to obtain items, for example, is taken as the lead actor ad-libbing on Smith's advice to make sure every moment was somewhat exciting). The film itself is a space opera in which astronaut Dick Starspeed (played in-universe by actor Jonathan Digby) has been shot down on an alien planet ruled by a tyrannical emperor.  Development  The Deadly Tower of Monsters was announced on 12 June 2015. A trailer was released on 2 December 2015. The game was released on 19 January 2016.

Description  The alpine marsh-marigold is a small hairless, perennial alpine herb, with short, stout rhizomes, and forms dense mats. Its leaves have petioles of about 5 cm long with a leafblade that is oblong or lanceolate rounded triangular, 8‚Äì40 mm long, emarginate, with 2 lanceolate triangular appendages of 4‚Äì20 mm long on the upper surface. The flowering stem is 1‚Äì2 cm long, but grows to 5‚Äì10 cm when seeds are ripe. The five to eight sepals are between 10‚Äì22 mm long, white, but often tinged pink or purple, particularly at the base and the veins. Fifteen to thirty stamens with white or often pinkish filaments and yellow pollen encircle six to eighteen free carpels. When ripe, these have developed into follicles which are spreading, have short beaks and contain few seeds. Flowering occurs between November and December, often directly from under the receding snow.  Distribution  C. Introloba is known from Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania where it grows in alpine fields. It occurs on the slopes of Mt Kosciusko and is locally common in spots with late- lying snow and between moss on the high ranges, such as Baw Baws, Snowy Range, Mt Buffalo, Bogong and Dargo High Plains. Usually flowering at edges of receding snow drifts.  Ecology  Caltha introloba occurs in Victoria with Brachyscome tadgellii, Carex gaudichaudiana, Carpha nivicola, Drosera arcturi, Oreobolus distichus and Schoenus calyptratus. Flower buds start growing in the middle of the southern summer (January) and have fully developed when fresh snow no longer melts away in May. Mostly the flowers open after the October snow melt, and some flowers open under the snow cover if this persists unto mid November. Seeds usually have completely developed at the end of summer (February). In an experiment, flower formation is triggered by long days and strong light. Another experiment showed that flowers will only open after a cold period, probably a mechanism to prevent premature opening in autumn. Seeds of Caltha introloba in another experiment were shown to germinate best between 22-27 ¬∞C, with a delay of 40‚Äì60 days, and hardly between 0-15 ¬∞C. However, after 4 months at 1-2 ¬∞C, germination below 15 ¬∞C was much faster and better. Seeds of C. introloba shed in the summer are thus unlikely to germinate before the snow melts in the following spring.

In January 2016 she was elected to serve in the Legislative Yuan as an at-large legislator on the party list of the New Power Party. Kawlo is a member of the Amis tribe of Taiwan's indigenous people and the cousin of singer Ilid Kaolo. Political career Kawlo was a founding member of the Amis Defense Alliance, an organisation dedicated to opposing excessive construction on Taiwan's east coast. Kawlo's first electoral experience was in standing for the Hualien County Council as an independent in 2014. She was a candidate in the 6th electoral district (which includes Fenglin, Shoufeng, Guangfu, Fengbin, and Wanrong), and fell 223 votes short of winning a seat. In 2015 Kawlo joined the newly created New Power Party (NPP) and was subsequently placed first on their party list for the 2016 Legislative Yuan election. As the NPP polled 6.1% of the vote in the party list ballot, she was duly elected as one of the NPP's two at-large legislators. Kawlo's political positions include pushing for recognition of the independence of Aboriginal tribes and acknowledgment of sovereignty over traditional tribal lands, as well as full enforcement of the Indigenous Basic Act. Upon taking office, Kawlo was assigned to the Education and Culture Committee. In July 2019, Green Party Taiwan accused Kawlo of securing government subsidies for non-government organizations founded by her former legislative assistant Chen Shih-chang and run by Chen Shih-chang's successor Chen En-tse. Subsequently, the New Power Party voted to suspend Kawlo's membership. Kawlo responded to the allegations by dismissing her legislative staff, and commencing an investigation into the case.

The name comes from gussetta, which formerly referred to the cocoon of the silkworm, whose breeding was widespread in the area. Agricultural complexes known as \\"agricultural courts\\", which once held prolific agricultural activity, are now civilian residences and businesses. Architecture The complex, which already existed in the sixteenth century, retains typical characteristics of rural architecture. The entrance to the farm is located west on Via Guzzina and features a turret on top. The small church of Santa Maria degli Angeli can be found a few feet to the south, its profile standing along the complex's perimeter wall. The lintel of the front door bears a commemorative inscription about the Virgin Mary. On the south side of the building there is a detached wing housing a small convent built in ancient times by the Capuchin friars. To the north, on Via Volturno, there is an entrance to the garden villa, built by nobleman De Capitani from Vimercate during the eighteenth century. It is u-shaped and is placed inside of the farm, almost at its center. History The census of 1530, at the beginning of the Spanish domination, shows that the area of the farm belonged to the Court of Monza and Milan, extending for 650 poles (). Its owners were Galeazzo Alfieri and prosecutor Francesco Pagano. When St. Charles Borromeo, archbishop of Milan, founded the parish of St. Bartholomew in Brugherio during 1578, Cascina Guzzina was in the territory administrated by the new parish. Documents from 1646 pertaining to a pastoral visit show that Vicar Foraneo visited the Church of St. Bartholomew, the Guzzina, and the oratory of Santa Maria degli Angeli (then dedicated to Saint Andrew), belonging to superintendent and Senator Andrea Alfieri. Another known owner of the farm was Count Giuseppe De Capitani from Vimercate. Ancient chronicles state that the farm counted with very experienced farmers and its soil was known for its quality wine production. The Sommarione of 1751 in the Cadastre Teresian lists other small owners of the land, such as the Sisters of St. Ursula, the Pestagalli family, Marquis Silva, Counts Scotti and Litta. Following administrative reform implemented by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in 1769, Cascina Guzzina was annexed officially to the closest municipality: Moncucco. Subsequently, Moncucco, became part of the municipality of Brugherio, as established by Royal Decree on December 9, 1866. In Sommarioni maps in the Cadastre Lombardo-Veneto of the year 1871, the Perego di Cremnago residence (used as a holiday home), a private chapel dedicated to the Magi, as well as farmhouses and extensive grounds are listed. These properties then passed to the counts of Venino. Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli In the south part of the Cascina Guzzina, a white outline shows the facade of a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary, as indicated in the inscription on the lintel of this entrance. The church, probably of 16th century origins, was once part of a small Franciscan monastery. Later, according to the will of the different noble owners of the villa, it has had various dedications: to Saint Andrew, to Saint Mary of the Angels, and finally to the three Magi. The interior consists of a small rectangular room with a raised chancel, separated from the nave by a marble balustrade and enhanced by the presence of two pilasters. The altar is in gray marble and is leaning against the back wall which is highlighted by precious paintings. Between two paintings there are reproduced illusionistically two niches where are depicted false columns surmounted by angels in prayer. Above the altar there is a painting in seventeenth century style representing the Virgin and Child, Saint Francis of Assisi showing hands with the stigmata and Saint Paul, with the classic attributes of the book and the sword. The heads of the Madonna and Child are adorned with crowns of gold, silver and precious stones, donated by the inhabitants of Cascina Guzzina in the fifties as a sign of devotion and thanksgiving for favors received and the protection granted. Below the painting in the background, you can recognize the Portiuncula, the small church of Saint Mary of the Angels, located on the outskirts of Assisi. The Porziuncola is linked to the life of Saint Francis and Saint Clare and, due to this fact, it so dear to the Franciscan tradition. The painting, which dates back to the period when the church was dedicated to Saint Mary of the Angels, is framed by a white stucco decoration. On either side depicts two candlesticks, decorated with festoons, bearing the monogram of the Virgin Mary; these decorations are inserted into two painted pilasters. On the lintel, above the painting, there are two angels holding a medallion depicting the monogram of Christ \\"JHS\\", that stands for Jesus Hominum Salvator. The ceiling of the church is completely frescoed: on the small nave shows a clear sky, in the presbytery it appears several times the monogram of the Virgin Mary, alternating with festoons and floral decorations, led by two angels in glory. The left aisle leads to a small room where it is possible to attend the Mass. In this room there are fragments of frescoes which appear fake architecture and, on the right, a small closet. On the doors, finely decorated in a seventeenth-century style, appear flowers, angels and the letters S and R suggest that the contents of the cabinet: Holy Relics.Sante Reliquie in Italian. On the floor above this room there is another similar space where it was possible to participate in the Holy Mass. In fact from the presbytery it is possible to see the wooden lattice from which you could assist at Mass.

The rally was organised by a coalition of non-governmental organisations, Bantah TPPA and Kongres Rakyat, and supported by various non- governmental organisations. The rally was held in response to the Malaysian government's signing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement in which twelve countries, namely Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, United States, Vietnam and including Malaysia concluded the trade negotiations in Atlanta on October 5, 2015. Opponents of the agreement argued that although TPPA could increase Malaysia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it was at the people's expense as it does not take into account issues faced by the people. The rally saw participants march from various points in Kuala Lumpur to their eventual destination, Dataran Merdeka.  Background  The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a trade agreement among twelve Pacific Rim countries concerning a variety of matters of economic policy, which was reached on 5 October 2015 after 7 years of negotiations. The agreement's stated goal had been to \\"promote economic growth; support the creation and retention of jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in our countries; and promote transparency, good governance, and enhanced labor and environmental protections.\\" Among other things, the TPP Agreement contains measures to lower trade barriers such as tariffs, and establish an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (but states can opt out from tobacco-related measures). Concerns have been made such as government procurement, state-owned enterprises, Bumiputera issues and public access to affordable drugs and healthcare, while ensuring necessary incentives for pharmaceutical innovators and rising cost of living. The organiser's application for holding the rally at Dataran Merdeka was rejected by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL). This however has not deterred the organisers from insisting that the rally would still take place.  Participants  It has been estimated that there will be 20,000 people attending the rally, as well as 300 non-governmental organisations. * Bersih * Perkasa * Ikatan Muslim Malaysia (Isma) * Gabungan Mahasiswa Islam se-Malaysia (Gamis) * Pertubuhan Ikram Malaysia (Ikram) * Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (Abim) * Socialist Party of Malaysia (PSM) * Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) * Amanah * Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) DAP slammed by PSM PSM Secretary General, Sivarajan slammed Lim Guan Eng of DAP on their stands regarding the rally and the upcoming protest on 23 Jan 2016.

PSM has been fighting the pro corporate US free trade agreements since 2006, when Rafidah Aziz negotiated the US Msia FTA. When DAP and PKR were still undecided on the matter then, and preferred not to offend the US, PSM has already been organizing protest at the US Embassy against US corporate interest. Thus, we will do the same come Saturday 23/1 to Protes the looming TPPA ! While various civil society and students held a protest outside USM when Minister Musthapa Mohamed went for a TPPA roadshow there recently, LGE decided to have a late nasi kandar dinner with the MInister instead.

Most identified specimens were found in Florida, though some have been found in Georgia and Louisiana. Its color is like that of Rabidosa carrana or Rabidosa rabida, but it is distinguished from other Rabidosa species by its paler color and distinct striped pattern on its back. The cephalothorax is a pale brown- yellow color. Between these is a narrower bright yellow to white streak that extends past the eyes. The sternum and abdomen are both pale, though the upper sides are streaked and spotted with brown markings. The eyes are on a black band that extends back, fading into the pale brown. The spermathecae are round and the palea of the pedipalp has a sclerotized cap. Males and females have a similar face and chelicera, though that of males is usually lighter brown. Males will generally have fewer lateral brown markings on the abdomen than females. In the field, it can be distinguished from similar looking species by the thin yellow stripe on its back. Though usually a ground-dweller, due to scopula hairs on the tarsi and metatarsi, it can sometimes climb into shrubs and bushes. It is the only wolf spider that climbs up into the higher vegetation in open woodland.

All for Jesus!\\" and originally titled \\"For the Love of Jesus\\", is an English Christian hymn. It was written in 1887 by W J Sparrow Simpson intended as the closing chorus of John Stainer's \\"The Crucifixion\\" oratorio. It started to be published as a separate hymn later in 1901.  History  In 1887, Sparrow Simpson was the Church of England curate of Christ Church in Marylebone, London. He wrote \\"All for Jesus, All for Jesus\\" for The Crucifixion, where he had initially titled it \\"For the Love of Jesus\\". It was written as a \\"meditation on the Passion of the Holy Redeemer\\" with scriptural references from the New Testament. The music for the hymn was written by Stainer, with the piece being titled \\"All for Jesus\\". The hymn was intended as a closing chorus and also to be a part of The Crucifixion set aside for congregational singing. The hymn was first performed in public at St Marylebone Parish Church on Ash Wednesday in 1887. After its first performance, \\"The Crucifixion\\" was praised in The Churchman as being \\"...a first and a very successful attempt to supply an easy and short form of Passion music suitable for use in ordinary parish churches,\\" though Stainer had previously described the whole oratorio as \\"rubbish\\". For several years, \\"All for Jesus, All for Jesus\\" was played only as part of The Crucifixion performances. In 1969 it was first published as a standalone hymn in the Methodist hymnal Hymns and Songs. From there it has been published as an independent hymn across Christian denominations. In Roman Catholic hymnals, an additional verse is included supporting the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation despite Sparrow Simpson being a member of the Church of England, which rejected that doctrine in the Thirty-Nine Articles.

It is situated between the Rh√¥ne and Parc de la T√™te d'Or and encompasses an area that had previously been the location of the Fair of Lyon. It is connected to the commune of Caluire-et-Cuire by the Passerelle de la Paix.  History  In 1984, the Fair of Lyon moved from its previous location near the Rh√¥ne to the Eurexpo in Chassieu. This freed land was designated as the site for the construction of the Cit√© Internationale by successive Lyon mayors (Michel Noir, Raymond Barre, and G√©rard Collomb). In 1985, Lyon mayor Francisque Collomb launched an international competition to design the site, which was won by architect Renzo Piano making him the project manager. The Cit√© Internationale was established in 1987 and the first construction zone was established in 1988. In 1989 the city decided to demolish the buildings that had housed the Fair of Lyon to make room for the new construction. In 1992, a second construction site was created. The first construction permits were issued in 1993, and construction began in September of that year. In 1998 the construction plan was modified to allow for the possible development of the future Palais des congr√®s de Lyon. The same year, the Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Lyon was completed. A Marriott hotel (previously-Hilton) was added in 1999, a casino in 2000, and the first apartments were built in 2001. The construction permits for an extension of the Palais des congr√®s de Lyon were filed in 2002, and construction started in 2003. Construction concluded in 2006 upon the completion of the Crowne Plaza Hotel and an amphitheatre.

She came from a family of actors; she was the middle child of Maurice Barrymore and Georgie Drew Barrymore, and had two brothers, Lionel and John. Reluctant to pursue her parents' career, the loss of financial support following the death of Louisa Lane Drew, caused Barrymore to give up her dream of becoming a concert pianist and instead earn a living on the stage. Barrymore's first Broadway role, alongside her uncle John Drew, Jr., was in The Imprudent Young Couple (1895). She soon found success, particularly after an invitation from William Gillette to appear on stage in his 1897 London production of Secret Service. Barrymore was soon popular with English society, and she had a number of romantic suitors, including Laurence Irving, the dramatist. His father, Henry Irving, cast her in The Bells (1897) and Peter the Great (1898). On her return to America in 1898, Barrymore was lauded by the press and public and, under Charles Frohman's management, she appeared in Catherine (1898) and Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines (1901) on Broadway. The latter play was a success, and Barrymore received particular praise. She went on to have a series of similarly popular roles in Cousin Kate (1903), Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire (1905), Lady Frederick (1908) and D√©class√©e (1920), among others. After a series of less well-received roles in the early 1920s, she returned to popularity with her role as the sophisticated spouse of a philandering husband in The Constant Wife (1927). In 1928 the Ethel Barrymore Theatre was opened in her honor, and she appeared in its inaugural production, The Kingdom of God. Barrymore began her film career in The Nightingale in 1914, followed by a series of other silent films, but she never dedicated herself to the medium fully. When opportunities for the right stage roles declined in the 1930s and she encountered financial difficulties, she appeared in her first talking film, Rasputin and the Empress (1932)‚Äîin which both her brothers also starred‚Äîand began radio broadcasts on the Blue Network with The Ethel Barrymore Theater. In the 1940s she had a last stage triumph in the long-running The Corn Is Green (1942), in which she had \\"perhaps her most acclaimed role\\", according to her biographer, Benjamin McArthur. Her film work became increasingly prominent in the 1940s and 1950s, and she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for None but the Lonely Heart (1944). She received subsequent Academy Award nominations‚Äîagain for Best Supporting Actress‚Äîfor The Spiral Staircase (1946), The Paradine Case (1947) and Pinky (1949). She was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960 and is, along with her two brothers, included in the American Theater Hall of Fame.

He performed for many years at Astley's Amphitheatre. Early life and career He was born in 1785. His father, the proprietor of a mechanical exhibition, travelled in the north of England and in Ireland. Richard took a share in the management of the exhibition, and inherited his father's talent in the construction of curious contrivances. With a friend he gave exhibitions in Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool, and other towns. At Christmas 1807 he appeared at the Liverpool Amphitheatre as a clown, and was immediately successful. In 1809 he first appeared at Astley's Amphitheatre in London, and remained popular there for many years. His annual benefit was an occasion on which extraordinary performances took place both in and out of the theatre. The most remarkable of these took place in 1828, when in a washing-tub drawn by geese he sailed down the Thames from Westminster to Waterloo Bridge. He was then to have proceeded in a car drawn by eight cats to the Coburg Theatre, but the crowd in the Waterloo Road made this impossible, and he was carried to the theatre on the shoulders of several watermen. Usher was known in the profession as the John Kemble of his art, and in the ring was the counterpart of Grimaldi on the stage, never descending to coarseness or vulgarity; his manner was irresistibly comic, and his jokes remarkable for their point and originality. He was the writer and inventor of several stock pantomimes. Later years With increasing years he gave up clowning, and confined himself to invention and design. William Batty purchased Astley's Amphitheatre and rebuilt the house in 1842; refusing to employ an architect, it was rebuilt according to Usher's plans and models. Usher died at Hercules Buildings, Lambeth, London, on 23 September 1843. His obituary in the Gentleman's Magazine wrote: \\"For the last half century no man had contributed more to the amusement of the public‚Ä¶ his name is familiar as a household word from the Shetlands to Cape Clear.\\" Family He married firstly Mrs. Pincott (the mother of Leonora Pincott, wife of Alfred Wigan); secondly, a sister of James William Wallack, who survived him with a family. His son Alfred Usher was a violinist and orchestra leader, active in Sydney, Australia by 1857.Dr Graeme Skinner. A biographical register of Australian colonial musical personnel‚ÄìU.

It is led by LSE Cities with support from Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Alfred Herrhausen Society into the relationship between the shape and society of cities. Research includes comparing urbanisation in already urbanised and currently urbanising regions of the world. Urban Age emerged as a product of the research and ideas of LSE Cities' Ricky Burdett, Philipp Rode and Richard Sennett and has since centred around conferences in a range of cities worldwide, as well as accompanying newspapers containing both global data sets and in-depth case studies.  Conferences  The first Urban Age conference was held in New York in February 2005 and subsequent conferences have taken place in Shanghai, London, Berlin, Johannesburg, Mumbai, S√£o Paulo, Istanbul, Chicago, Hong Kong, Rio de Janeiro and Delhi. The Urban Age conferences have aimed to bring together planners, mayors, architects, academics and other stakeholders to discuss themes such as urban health and well-being, urban governance and how cities respond to the impact of major events like the hosting of the Olympic Games. Participants have included a number of current and former city leaders, including Bogot√°'s Enrique Pe√±alosa, London's Boris Johnson, Delhi's Sheila Dikshit, Kampala's Jennifer Musisi, and Barcelona's Ada Colau, and national leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. The ten year celebration of Urban Age, taking place in November and December 2015, consisted of five Global Debates on cities and climate change, designing urban infrastructure, the politics of equity, social inclusion and steering urban growth. These debates were accompanied by a series of articles published by Guardian Cities. In 2016 Urban Age was invited to curate a Special Project at the 15th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice. Conflicts of an Urban Age highlights the changes to seven cities that have experienced significant population increases in the past 25 years and has since exhibited in Berlin, the inaugural 2017 Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism and at Arup Group's phase2 gallery in London and Sydney.The Urban Age Shaping Cities conference was held alongside the exhibition. Between 2017-2018 the programme focused on African cities including Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam, Nairobi, Kampala, Lagos, Accra and Cape Town culminating with the Developing Urban Futures conference and publication in Addis Ababa on 29-30 November 2018.  Publications and data  Each Urban Age conference has also produced a newspaper with feature articles, global, regional and city-specific data and graphics, as well as reflections from conference participants. This content has been organised and disseminated through the Urban Age digital platform, launched in December 2015. Ricky Burdett and Deyan Sudjic have also edited two books: The Endless City (2008) and Living in the Endless City (2011), which chronicle the main findings, discussions and research of the early Urban Age conferences. The Urban Age programme and concept has generated significant debate among urbanists, with critiques and appraisals produced in several academic journals. Urban Age data visualisations have also been featured in a variety of online and print media, including urban footprint graphics, transport infrastructure maps and residential density graphics. A third book in the series, Shaping Cities in an Urban Age, became available in 2018 . Edited by Burdett and Philipp Rode, the book was launched at the 16th International Architecture Exhibition in September 2018.  Urban Age Scholarships  Urban Age Scholarships provide financial support to applicants of LSE Cities' Executive MSc in Cities programme in an effort to broaden access to knowledge and debate around how cities are designed and governed.

What remains is a pure traversable wormhole comprising a pair of identical twin, nonflat, three-dimensional regions joined at a two-sphere, the 'throat' of the wormhole. As seen in the image shown, two-dimensional equatorial cross sections of the wormhole are catenoidal 'collars' that are asymptotically flat far from the throat. There being no gravity in force, an inertial observer (test particle) can sit forever at rest at any point in space, but if set in motion by some disturbance will follow a geodesic of an equatorial cross section at constant speed, as would also a photon. This phenomenon shows that in space-time the curvature of space has nothing to do with gravity (the 'curvature of time‚Äô, one could say). As a special case of the Ellis drainhole, itself a 'traversable wormhole', the Ellis wormhole dates back to the drainhole's discovery in 1969 (date of first submission) by H. G. Ellis, and independently at about the same time by K. A. Bronnikov. Ellis and Bronnikov derived the original traversable wormhole as a solution of the Einstein vacuum field equations augmented by inclusion of a scalar field \\\\phi minimally coupled to the geometry of space-time with coupling polarity opposite to the orthodox polarity (negative instead of positive). Some years later M. S. Morris and K. S. Thorne manufactured a duplicate of the Ellis wormhole to use as a tool for teaching general relativity, asserting that existence of such a wormhole required the presence of 'negative energy', a viewpoint Ellis had considered and explicitly refused to accept, on the grounds that arguments for it were unpersuasive. The wormhole solution The wormhole metric has the proper- time form : c^2 d\\\\tau^2 = c^2 dt^2 - d\\\\sigma^2 \\\\, , where : \\\\begin{align} d\\\\sigma^2 &= d\\\\rho^2 + r^2(\\\\rho) \\\\, d\\\\Omega^2 \\\\ &= d\\\\rho^2 + \\\\left(\\\\rho^2 + n^2\\\\right) \\\\, d\\\\Omega^2 \\\\ &= d\\\\rho^2 + \\\\left(\\\\rho^2 + n^2\\\\right) \\\\, \\\\left[d\\\\vartheta^2 + (\\\\sin \\\\vartheta)^2 \\\\, d\\\\varphi^2\\\\right] \\\\;\\\\; \\\\end{align} and n is the drainhole parameter that survives after the parameter m of the Ellis drainhole solution is set to 0 to stop the ether flow and thereby eliminate gravity. If one goes further and sets n to 0, the metric becomes that of Minkowski space-time, the flat space-time of the special theory of relativity. In Minkowski space-time every timelike and every lightlike (null) geodesic is a straight 'world line' that projects onto a straight-line geodesic of an equatorial cross section of a time slice of constant t, as, for example, the one on which t = 0 and \\\\vartheta = \\\\pi/2, the metric of which is that of euclidean two-space in polar coordinates [\\\\rho,\\\\varphi], namely, :ds^2 = d\\\\rho^2 + \\\\rho^2 \\\\, d\\\\varphi^2 \\\\, . Every test particle or photon is seen to follow such an equatorial geodesic at a fixed coordinate speed, which could be 0, there being no gravitational field built into Minkowski space-time. These properties of Minkowski space-time all have their counterparts in the Ellis wormhole, modified, however, by the fact that the metric and therefore the geodesics of equatorial cross sections of the wormhole are not straight lines, rather are the 'straightest possible' paths in the cross sections. It is of interest, therefore, to see what these equatorial geodesics look like. Equatorial geodesics of the wormhole Geodesics confined to one side of the wormhole throat Geodesics spiraling onto the wormhole throat Geodesics passing through the wormhole throat The equatorial cross section of the wormhole defined by t = 0 and \\\\vartheta = \\\\pi/2 (representative of all such cross sections) bears the metric :ds^2 = d\\\\rho^2 + \\\\left(\\\\rho^2 + n^2\\\\right) \\\\, d\\\\varphi^2 \\\\, . When the cross section with this metric is embedded in euclidean three-space the image is the catenoid \\\\mathcal C shown above, with \\\\rho measuring the distance from the central circle at the throat, of radius n, along a curve on which \\\\varphi is fixed (one such being shown). In cylindrical coordinates [r,\\\\varphi,z] the equation r = n \\\\cosh(z/n) has \\\\mathcal C as its graph. After some integrations and substitutions the equations for a geodesic of \\\\mathcal C parametrized by s reduce to : \\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{ds} = \\\\frac{h}{\\\\rho^2 + n^2} and : \\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\rho}{ds}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{h^2}{\\\\rho^2 + n^2} \\\\, = 1, where h is a constant. If d\\\\rho/ds \\\\equiv 0 \\\\, , then h^2 = \\\\rho^2 + n^2 \\\\geq n^2 \\\\, , \\\\textstyle d\\\\varphi/ds = 1/h, and \\\\textstyle \\\\rho = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{h^2 - n^2} \\\\, , and vice versa. Thus every 'circle of latitude' (\\\\rho = constant) is a geodesic. If on the other hand d\\\\rho/ds is not identically 0, then its zeroes are isolated and the reduced equations can be combined to yield the orbital equation :\\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{d\\\\rho}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{h^2}{\\\\left(\\\\rho^2 + n^2\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\rho^2 + n^2 - h^2\\\\right)} \\\\, . There are three cases to be considered: * h^2 > n^2, which implies that \\\\rho^2 \\\\geq h^2 - n^2 > 0, thus that the geodesic is confined to one side of the wormhole or the other and has a turning point at \\\\textstyle \\\\rho = \\\\sqrt{h^2 - n^2} or \\\\textstyle \\\\rho = -\\\\sqrt{h^2 - n^2} \\\\, ; * h^2 = n^2, which entails that \\\\rho^2 > 0, so that the geodesic does not cross the throat at \\\\rho = 0, but spirals onto it from one side or the other; * h^2 < n^2, which allows the geodesic to traverse the wormhole from either side to the other. The figures exhibit examples of the three types. If s is allowed to vary from -\\\\infty to \\\\infty, the number of orbital revolutions possible for each type, latitudes included, is unlimited. For the first and third types the number rises to infinity as h^2 \\\\to n^2; for the spiral type and the latitudes the number is already infinite. That these geodesics can bend around the wormhole makes clear that the curvature of space alone, without the aid of gravity, can cause test particles and photons to follow paths that deviate significantly from straight lines and can create lensing effects. Dynamic Ellis wormhole There is a dynamic version of the Ellis wormhole that is a solution of the same field equations that the static Ellis wormhole is a solution of. Its metric is : c^2 d\\\\tau^2 = c^2 dt^2 - d\\\\sigma^2 \\\\, , where : d\\\\sigma^2 = d\\\\rho^2 + \\\\left[\\\\left(1 + a^2\\\\right) \\\\rho^2 + a^2 c^2 t^2 \\\\, \\\\right] \\\\, d\\\\Omega^2 \\\\, , a being a positive constant. There is a 'point singularity' at t = \\\\rho = 0, but everywhere else the metric is regular and curvatures are finite. Geodesics that do not encounter the point singularity are complete; those that do can be extended beyond it by proceeding along any of the geodesics that encounter the singularity from the opposite time direction and have compatible tangents (similarly to geodesics of the graph of z = (xy)^3 that encounter the singularity at the origin). For a fixed nonzero value of t the equatorial cross section on which \\\\vartheta = \\\\pi/2 has the metric : \\\\begin{align} ds^2 &= d\\\\rho^2 + r^2(t,\\\\rho) \\\\, d\\\\varphi^2 \\\\ &= d\\\\rho^2 + \\\\left[\\\\left(1 + a^2\\\\right) \\\\rho^2 + a^2 c^2 t^2 \\\\, \\\\right] \\\\, d\\\\varphi^2 \\\\, . \\\\end{align} This metric describes a 'hypercatenoid' similar to the equatorial catenoid of the static wormhole, with the radius n of the throat (where \\\\rho = 0) now replaced by a c t, and in general each circle of latitude of geodesic radius \\\\rho having circumferential radius \\\\textstyle r(t,\\\\rho) = \\\\sqrt{(1 + a^2) \\\\rho^2 + a^2 c^2 t^2}. For t = 0 the metric of the \\\\vartheta = \\\\pi/2 equatorial cross section is : ds^2 = d\\\\rho^2 + \\\\left(1 + a^2\\\\right)\\\\rho^2 \\\\, d\\\\varphi^2 \\\\, , which describes a 'hypercone' with its vertex at the singular point, its latitude circles of geodesic radius \\\\rho having circumferences \\\\textstyle 2 \\\\pi r(0,\\\\rho) = 2 \\\\pi \\\\sqrt{1 + a^2} \\\\rho \\\\, . Unlike the catenoid, neither the hypercatenoid nor the hypercone is fully representable as a surface in euclidean three-space; only the portions where \\\\textstyle dr(t,\\\\rho)/d\\\\rho = (1 + a^2) \\\\rho\\\\big/\\\\sqrt{(1 + a^2)\\\\rho^2 + a^2 c^2 t^2} \\\\leq 1 (thus where \\\\textstyle \\\\rho \\\\leq c t\\\\big/\\\\sqrt{1 + a^2} or equivalently \\\\textstyle r(t,\\\\rho) \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{1 + a^2} c t) can be embedded in that way. Dynamically, as t advances from -\\\\infty to \\\\infty the equatorial cross sections shrink from hypercatenoids of infinite radius to hypercones (hypercatenoids of zero radius) at t = 0, then expand back to hypercatenoids of infinite radius. Examination of the curvature tensor reveals that the full dynamic Ellis wormhole space-time manifold is asymptotically flat in all directions - timelike, lightlike, and spacelike.

His photographs documented high- profile state occasions along with daily life in East Berlin. He died as the result of a helicopter accident while on an assignment in Libya. Sources attributing his work sometimes identify him simply as Joachim Spremberg. Life Joachim Spremberg was born in Berlin late in 1943. After leaving school he trained as a film copying technician, a preparation to becoming a photo-journalist. He started work with the Pictures Department of the state news agency (Allgemeiner Deutscher Nachrichtendienst / ADN) in 1964. Here he quickly and single-mindedly started photo-reporting significant events.Neues Deutschland 8 March 1978, p. 3 Along with daily life he documented the construction of the Berlin Television Tower and was frequently employed at important national events, including some involving the national leader, Walter Ulbricht. Spremberg joined the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED) in 1969. His reporting career earned him awards that included the East German Medal of Merit (Verdienstmedaille), the Banner of Labor and the Distinguished Service Medal of the National People's Army. In March 1978 Spremberg accompanied the media-savvy politician Werner Lamberz on a visit to Libya where Lamberz was scheduled to negotiate a complex trade and investment deal with that country's leader. Early in March 1978, the final meeting between Lamberz and Gaddafi took place in a large tented encampment set up by the latter in the Libyan desert. At 21.30 on 6 March 1978, shortly after taking off en route back from the tented encampment at Wadi Suf al-Jin (WƒÅdƒ´ Sawfajjƒ´n), the Super Frelon helicopter carrying the four-member East German delegation fell into a tailspin and crashed. None of the four survived. Those who died along with Werner Lamberz were the Central Committee International Relations chief, Paul Markowski, the translator Armin Ernst and the news-photographer Hans-Joachim Spremberg. It was later reported that Lamberz's Libyan negotiating partners had urged him to stay an extra night and not to risk traveling in a helicopter with a Libyan pilot who was known to have no experience of night flying. The formal agreement between the two countries on the training of military personnel came into effect only twelve months later. The leadership in Libya did not permit any external investigation of what happened, but according to the Libyan accident report the helicopter reached an altitude of about 30 meters, and then attempted to move off to the left, but instead fell like a stone to the ground and exploded. The official Libyan report imputed all the blame for the accident to the pilot. Subsequent conspiracy theories have circled the events ever since, but none of these has progressed beyond a series of tantalising conjectural scenarios.

He played Harry Thompson in Hollyoaks, and was nominated for best newcomer at the 21st National Television Awards in 2016. The character was killed off in 2019 after four years on the soap. Background Glasspool was born on 5 March 1992 to a Welsh mother and English father in Hollywood, Worcestershire, and was educated at Woodrush High School in Wythall and Stratford-upon-Avon College and then studied for a BA Honours in Acting for Stage and Media at Kingston College; although many websites give this as the University of West London, this is because the course is validated by them. Parry has a younger brother, Lloyd Glasspool, a tennis professional, who debuted at 2016 Wimbledon Championships, playing doubles alongside fellow Brummie Dan Evans. Career Within a week of graduating from Kingston College, Glasspool was filming for series 6 of Hollyoaks Later, a spin-off of Hollyoaks. He was cast in the role of Tony Hutchinson's estranged son, Harry Thompson, who had previously appeared in Hollyoaks between 2007 and 2009, then played by Daniel Seymour and later Harrison George Rhodes. Glasspool has noted that being called Parry and playing a character called Harry can be confusing, and that one person called him Parry on set and it was aired. After this, he appeared in a two short films - How To Be Sexy by Isabelle Sieb and Cicada by Delouris Collins - and on Our Zoo for BBC1. He later moved to Liverpool after being invited to participate in the main series of Hollyoaks, with his first episode being broadcast 9 February 2015 on E4 and a day later on Channel 4. For his role as Thompson, he was nominated for best newcomer at the National Television Awards. Parry left Hollyoaks in July 2019 after his character, Harry, was killed by resident serial killer Breda Mcqueen. He has since joined the theatre production, By The Waters of Liverpool. The tour was supposed to take place from March until the end of May 2020. But due to the Covid 19 lockdown, the play was cancelled after only 2 weeks of production. Controversy In August 2016, Glasspool posted a video on the social media application Instagram showing him wielding a knife while pretending to be a woman threatening to kill her boyfriend. Glasspool was suspended from Hollyoaks for two weeks.

Founded as a newspaper publisher, S√ºddeutscher Verlag developed into one of Germany's largest media companies providing to Germany and abroad. The publisher has continued to focus in the areas of newspapers, journals and books. The company's headquarters is the SV-Hochhaus in Munich's district Zamdorf. The SV printing center is located in the neighboring district of Steinhausen.  History  The activities of the S√ºddeutscher Verlag began with the publication of the first edition of the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung on 6 October 1945. The S√ºddeutsche Verlag GmbH, with headquarters in Munich, was founded in 1947 by the shareholders August Schwingenstein, Edmund Goldschagg, Franz Josef Sch√∂ningh and Werner Friedmann. Three years later the first book publisher was founded. Other investments, acquisitions and new formations followed. Today, more than one hundred subsidiaries are part of the S√ºddeutscher Verlag. The headquarters in the Sendlinger Stra√üe was sold by the publishing house in 2004. Since the fall of 2008, the headquarters of the publishing house is located in the new SV-Hochhaus in Munich-Zamdorf.  Sale in 2007  The S√ºddeutscher Verlag was largely owned by five Munich publisher families, the descendants of the founders, until 2007. These were the families of Friedmann (shares: 18.75%), Goldschagg (18.75%), Seidlein (18.75%), Schwingenstein (16.67%) and D√ºrrmeier (8.33%), and also the most recent addition of the S√ºdwestdeutsche Medien Holding (SWMH) (18.75%). Chairman of the shareholders association was Christian Goldschagg. In August 2004, Hanswilli Jenke and Klaus Josef Lutz were managing directors of the publishing house. Four of the five associate families (D√ºrrmeier, Goldschagg, Schwingenstein and Seidlein) finally agreed, after years of speculation, to sell their shares totaling 62.5% in 2007. Prospective buyers that came forth were M.

The three had previously worked together in Yes for the 1991‚Äì1992 Union Tour. The trio were first announced as working together in 2010. After working on new music since 2011, the band announced activity in January 2016 as Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman. Plans for a possible studio album were put on hold to concentrate on touring; their debut worldwide tour, An Evening of Yes Music and More, began in October 2016 and continued through to 2017, with bassist Lee Pomeroy and drummer Lou Molino III. In April 2017, following the three members being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of Yes, the band announced their new name, which they had already been using in European touring. After the conclusion of a 50th anniversary tour in 2018, there was no further public activity. The group had disbanded by 2020.  History = Formation = Singer Jon Anderson, singer and guitarist Trevor Rabin, and keyboardist Rick Wakeman were former members of the progressive rock band Yes. Anderson had co-founded Yes with bassist Chris Squire in 1968, and had been a member in three stints until 2008; Wakeman had been a member in five stints between 1971 and 2004; Rabin had been a member from 1983 to 1995. The only time the three had performed together in Yes was the 1991‚Äì1992 Union Tour during the band's short time as an eight-member formation. Plans to have Wakeman play with Anderson and Rabin on Talk (1994) never materialised. For Wakeman, not playing on a Yes studio album with Rabin became one of his regrets. Away from Yes, each pair had worked together in various capacities. The first announcement of activity between the three came on the 6 February 2010 episode of Wakeman's radio show on Planet Rock, when he mentioned a recent discussion among himself, Rabin, \\"and a couple of other ex-members of Yes who will remain nameless\\" about the idea of recording a new album. This was later revealed to include Anderson. Rumours that former Yes drummer Bill Bruford was to be a participant caught some momentum after they were reported in rock music magazines. After several weeks of speculation about the rumour, Bruford wrote a blog entry on his website in May 2010 stressing his retirement from performance in 2009, and denied any involvement in such plans with the claim that he was not invited by either member. Developments on the project then progressed slowly, mainly due to the remaining three members' commitments to their solo projects and conflicting schedules. In October 2010, Rabin said that the group had yet to formally begin work on the project, but noted Anderson and himself were \\"really itching\\" to proceed. There was writing and development work from 2011. Squire's death in June 2015 became a catalyst for the three to, as Wakeman said, progress with plans, record new music, and play Yes music on stage \\"as we feel it should be performed\\". In December 2015, Brian Lane, manager of Wakeman for the past three years and the manager of Yes in the 1970s, encouraged the three to formally launch the band. Rabin felt it was the right time as he wished to take a break from scoring films, and Wakeman was prepared to devote time to take part. On 9 January 2016, Rabin announced via his Facebook page that the three plan to tour later in the year. Two days later, Anderson posted an update revealing the group's name as Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman (ARW for short). Later that month, Wakeman confirmed Lane as the band's manager. Rabin stressed the group do not intend to be a rival of Yes and maintains there are no negative feelings towards them. News of the band's formation was welcomed by current Yes keyboardist Geoff Downes, and guitarist Steve Howe wished them good luck. = Touring and name change = In June 2016, the band agreed to put their album \\"on the back burner\\" and make their debut tour a priority. Anderson reasoned the decision down to the little amount of time available for the group to tour and exchange music, in addition to the fact that the group were unsure how or what to record. He also said that the \\"important thing is to establish ourselves.\\" Preparations for the tour began in mid-2016 in Los Angeles, which involved Anderson, Rabin, and two supporting musicians: English bassist Lee Pomeroy and American drummer Lou Molino III, both longtime bandmates of Wakeman and Rabin, respectively. Wakeman joined them in early August for a week's rehearsals. The five were to be joined by American multi-instrumentalist Gary Cambra, but his involvement was soon withdrawn. Larry Magid was appointed as the tour's director after Lane contacted him with the offer; Magid, who first worked with Yes in 1971 and kept good relations with the members, agreed as the project seemed interesting and fun. Jonathan Smeeton became involved to manage the stage production and lighting. In early 2017, the band started calling itself \\"Yes featuring Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman\\". (Ticket for the London performance shown.) The An Evening of Yes Music and More tour began in October 2016 and finished one year later, covering North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The group performed a setlist of Yes songs that cover various eras of Yes's career, from The Yes Album (1971) to Union (1991), as well as Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe's only studio album. On 9 April 2017, the band issued a press release which announced their name change to Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman, a name that had been used on the prior European leg of touring. The band's Quintessential Yes: The 50th Anniversary Tour was held to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Yes from June to September 2018. The initial plan was for the group to perform 100 dates worldwide, but Rabin resisted the idea and has implied otherwise. Jon Anderson's wife's diagnosis with breast cancer and then Rick Wakeman's wife with the same also impacted on touring, with the latter causing the last tour leg to be cut short.Prog, #110, p. 33https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6UTvU1_xj4 On 7 September 2018, the band released a recording of their March 25, 2017 show at the Manchester Apollo on a live album and video titled Live at the Apollo from Eagle Records. =Cancelled studio album and disbandment= A studio album was in progress from April 2011, which began when Anderson and Rabin exchanged musical ideas online by sharing music files recorded at their home studios, to which Wakeman then incorporated his own later. Anderson described their new songs as \\"unique\\"; Wakeman said they sound \\"Very fresh, full of life, energy and melody\\". Development on the material halted in March 2012 when Rabin needed time with his family and his career in film scoring, and Wakeman had become too busy with other commitments. Activity resumed six months later with Wakeman submitting additional ideas to Anderson. Music was worked on progressively thereafter. In June 2016, Rabin said that the group had assembled just \\"bits and pieces of song ideas\\", and that offers had been made by record labels, but all were declined so the trio could maintain control over the album's musical direction. Three months later, they decided not to play their new music on their debut tour due to the likelihood of audience recordings of the new songs surfacing online while they were still being worked on. The album was expected for release in late 2018 or early 2019,Prog, July 2017 issue but has yet to be given a release date or even a title. Anderson revealed one idea which involved releasing the music in three phases as some of it may contain pieces of extended length. In July 2018, the first original song by the band, \\"Fragile\\", had its debut broadcast on Steve Jones' radio show Jonesy's Jukebox on KLOS-FM in Los Angeles. It is based on a piece by Rabin that initially appeared in 2015 over the end credits of an episode of the American television drama series Agent X, for which Rabin contributed to its score. In March 2019, lead singer Jon Anderson announced that the band had no plans for further touring or recording, citing \\"mismanagement\\" of the band and a failure to agree on whether to release new music or perform existing Yes material exclusively. In July 2019, Wakeman said that the band would regroup for a tour in 2020, after which they planned to \\"close the lid on it\\". However, he did not rule out releasing new music, stating that it depended on the quality: \\"I would like to think we can leave one final burst of music that we can be proud of and, perhaps, we'd like to think that Yes fans have been waiting for.\\" Rabin, however, said in several interviews in 2020 that the band was over. Wakeman said one reason was him living in the UK and the other two in different parts of California, having to share ideas online. Earlier in 2020, Brian Lane was dismissed as manager but will still manage Wakeman's solo career. Legal rights to the name \\"Yes\\" At the time of Squire's death, the band name \\"Yes\\" was co-owned by Anderson, Squire, Howe, and Yes drummer Alan White. During Squire's lifetime, he and Anderson had informally agreed that only Squire's group would use the name \\"Yes\\". In 2018, Anderson said that Squire's wife Scotland had suggested, in the wake of his death, that both groups could use the name.

Built in 1938, it is unusual as a late example of Queen Anne architecture, having been built as a near replica of the owner's previous house, which was destroyed by fire in 1937. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Everett Wallace House stands in the southern part of the village center of Milbridge, on the west side of US 1 just north of its junction with Wyman Road. It is set on a lot fronted by a picket fence along with a two-car detached garage. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with asymmetrical styling typical of the Queen Anne period. It has a steeply pitched gabled roof, a brick foundation, and an exterior clad in a variety of finishes, including wooden shingles, aluminum siding, and applied Stick style half timbering. It is roughly L-shaped, its shape somewhat obscured by single- story porches along the front, one of which has been enclosed in glass. Its front is in three sections, with a central three-story tower flanked by a projecting gabled section on the right and a recessed one on the left. The house was built by Everett Wallace, a local merchant, in 1938, after the family's 1890s Queen Anne Victorian was destroyed by fire in 1937. The basic design appears to have been taken from a pattern book, since a nearly identical 1890s house stands in Boothbay Harbor. The earlier Wallace House is documented from a series of postcards produced in the early 20th century.

Built in 1936, it is a local example of Colonial Revival architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 for its association with early formalized efforts by the state to promote tourism. Description and history The former Maine Publicity Bureau Building stands below the southernmost end of Portland's Western Promenade, on the northeast side of a 90-degree bend in Danforth Street just before its western end. Although the building stands on a slight rise above Danforth Street, its view of the Fore River is obscured by the raised embankment that carries Commercial Street. The building is a 1-1/2 story brick building with Colonial Revival style, with a five-bay side gable central section flanked by symmetrical single-story front gable projecting sections. The flanking sections each have a Palladian-style window group, with narrow fixed windows flanking a central sash that is topped by a half-round fan. The center section has regular sash windows set in rectangular openings with flat keystoned lintels. The main entrance is a recessed double door, the opening flanked by pilasters and topped by a broken segmented pediment. The main room of the interior features high quality woodwork. The building was designed by Portland architect John Pickering Thomas and was completed in 1936 with funding support from the Works Progress Administration. The Maine Publicity Bureau was founded in Portland in 1921 by a group of the state's business leaders, as a formalized way to promote the state's business, industrial, and recreational resources. At first located in offices on Congress Street, the group chose this prominent location for a permanent home when it outgrew those facilities. The land and building were owned by the state, and were leased by the Bureau until 1979, when its headquarters was relocated to Hallowell.

The devices are portable and have the appearance of a receiver rather than a transmitter, making them more practical for citizen use and harder for authorities to detect when used subversively in pirate radio networks. It was designed by German-based non-profit organization Media in Cooperation and Transition (MiCT) in 2013 and has been deployed in Syria to create the radio network called Syrnet. Development MiCT led the project as an extension of its work on media projects to empower people in areas of conflict and crisis. The device's design is a result of the organization's collaboration with German design firm IXDS. Radio, as an analog medium, is more difficult than Internet and phone networks to shut down, requires less physical infrastructure, and its use is less dependent on a functional electric grid. For these reasons radio is a common medium among resistance and other independent groups. The early versions' shoebox-sized appearance, as described by The Local, was \\"a black box about thirty centimeters in length and twenty wide. It is smooth and light with a corrugated surface.\\" Its design emphasizes portability and an appearance unlike typical transmitters. Version 3, introduced at the Global Media Forum in June 2016, is smaller, measuring 20 x 20 x 13 cm, with an aluminum case. The cost of version 3 at release was 3,000. The Pocket FM was a finalist for 2016 Siemens Stiftung Empowering People Award. Technical overview Pocket FM is intended for use in areas with poor or unreliable broadcasting infrastructure, and incorporates several design elements to support its operation in challenging situations. Radio stations typically use large transmitters to produce strong signals broadcast across large areas. However, large transmitters are very expensive, challenging to maintain, and provide highly visible targets for those wishing to sabotage, raid, hijack, or otherwise interrupt communications. The idea behind Pocket FM is to instead create a network of many small transmitters that can blanket an area. The first two versions had a range of , with version 3 up to , using only a antenna. The device has the ability to change frequencies in case the default frequency is jammed or otherwise unavailable, and it broadcasts a signature using the Radio Data System (RDS) protocol to allow listeners to find the new station if it changes. RDS can also be used to broadcast other text-based messages to users with compatible tuners. The device runs on 10-15 volts of electricity, capable of being used with a standard power adapter, solar power, or through a car's cigarette lighter receptacle. It is capable of operating autonomously for extended periods when given a steady power supply, and can be passcode-protected to prevent unauthorized transmission. The computational foundation of the device is Raspberry Pi, an inexpensive, customizable computer platform about the size of a credit card. The use of Raspberry Pi helps to keep the cost of the units low, but its simple, open design also allows for flexibility and experimentation with different configurations and upgrades. Pocket FM can broadcast material connected through basic analog audio inputs. Importantly, it also comes with a built-in satellite receiver to download audio or connect to a live feed over the Internet where there is otherwise no Internet connection available. It uses Airtime Pro software by Sourcefabric to compile the content stream and provide the streaming links for both public internet streams and towards MiCT‚Äôs satellite provider. The third version of the device has GSM, 3G, and wi-fi capabilities, creating several ways of accessing and operating it remotely, depending on available technology: SMS text message, an Internet browser, or directly via wireless network. Implementations A woman using Pocket FM to broadcast from her vehicle in Tanzania Pocket FM was first deployed in Syria in September 2013. Since then MiCT has also started a project in Sierra Leone and smaller initiatives in Yemen and Tanzania. MiCT has produced about two dozen units. =Syria= Pocket FM was developed for use in Syria. Throughout the Syrian Civil War, president Bashar Assad has exerted control over communications infrastructure, frequently disabling Internet, phone networks, and electricity, and making frequent use of propaganda and misinformation in state-run mass media. But when other modes of communication become unavailable and unbiased reporting is inaccessible, most Syrians still have access to a radio receiver, either as a battery-powered stand-alone device or as part of a cell phone. Syrnet, a radio network enabled by Pocket FM, launched in September 2013 to provide information that would be censored or manipulated if reported on by state-run media. , Syrnet operates nine stations in different areas of the country, including areas controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). In addition to allowing for reports to be shared with other regions where the situation may be very different, the use of a structure with multiple centers of operation ensures that a raid on one does not pose an existential threat to the broadcast. The units change hands multiple times in order to get them into the country, ending up with a local resident who has identified a potential location to hide the transmitter, as far from civilian homes as possible without losing the signal. Given the political climate, the frequency with which journalists and activists have been detained or even killed, and the ease with which any radio transmitter can be triangulated even if not visually identified, precautions are necessary. According to MiCT project manager Philip Hochleichter, none of the units have been discovered , and only one has been lost, due to bombing in Koban√Æ. The network combines local and external content, which is broadcast throughout the country via Pocket FM as well as through NileSat and Internet downloads. The radio network approach to broadcasting allows Syrian citizens access to censored outside broadcasts, creates a sustainable system for communications between and about different parts of the country and the dissemination of stories to a global audience. To help local stations and reporters, MiCT employs a team of professionals from the journalism field to assist with production. =Sierra Leone= MiCT is working with Culture Radio, a Freetown media organization, to disseminate information about Ebola to communities in Sierra Leone who have not had access to other campaigns about the disease and its prevention.

It was developed by Germany-based non-profit organization Media in Cooperation and Transition (MiCT), with funding provided by the German Foreign Office. , there are nine studios producing content in different parts of the country. Background Syrian president Bashar Assad has repeatedly sabotaged or exerted control over communications infrastructure, disabling Internet, phone networks, and even electricity. The media that is accessible is often created by or filtered by the Syrian government, which makes frequent use of propaganda and misinformation. Radio, as an analog technology, is more difficult than the Internet and phone networks to shut down. It also requires less physical infrastructure and its use is less dependent on a functional electric grid. For these reasons radio is a common medium among resistance and other independent groups. Some Syrians have had access to Western-operated external broadcasts prior to Syrnet, but those stations have typically operated outside of the country, leaving a scarcity of coverage of the most immediate and important news stories. A Syrnet relay antenna Operations Syrnet comprises nine geographically separated studios inside Syria's borders, . Two are in locations controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), having begun broadcasting prior to the area being taken over. The multiple operational centers allow for local news and announcements and ensures that a disruption to one or two does not lead to a shutdown of production. The broadcast feed is a combination of local content created at the nine studios with external broadcasts, ensuring as many Syrians as possible have access to reports from outside as well as from parts of the country where the situation may be very different. For those with Internet access, and in order to spread the content more widely, broadcasts are also made available for download on the Web. MiCT employs a number of professional journalists to assist the local stations and reporters. Technical basis Pocket FM, a portable radio transmitter The original plan for Syrnet called for standard 1‚Äì1.5 kilowatt relay antennas to broadcast over sizable parts of the country. The financial and practical challenges associated with their installation, maintenance, and operation led MiCT to explore the deployment of a larger number of small transmitters rather than small number of large ones, eventually leading to the development of Pocket FM. Pocket FM is a small, portable radio transmitter developed by MiCT in collaboration with Germany- based design firm IXDS. Due to its small size and design, it looks more like a receiver than a transmitter, making it more difficult to detect, sabotage, or hijack, and much cheaper to run. Syrnet operates through twelve Pocket FM transmitters, each of which is capable of reaching up to six kilometers, and five larger relays. The Pocket FM units, which can run on solar power or an automobile's 12-volt battery, are equipped with built-in satellite receivers to pick up the Syrnet feed and broadcast it over-the-air. MiCT collaborates with Syrian activists, journalists, and logistical experts to bring the devices into the country. Programming Syrnet airs a blend of content produced in the area around the station, created by stations in other parts of the country, and external programming.

Biography  Sandra Hofferth, Professor in the Department of Family Science at the University of Maryland, is a former Director of the Maryland Population Research Center (2008‚Äì2012) and a former co-Director of the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics. She was Vice President of the Population Association of America in 2010. Her research interests are in American children's use of time and later health outcomes, work and family, fathers and fathering, and family policy. She has published on the effects of racial/ethnic disparities at the individual and neighborhood levels on father (and mother) involvement and child outcomes and published a series of papers on social capital. Dr. Hofferth has researched family issues in the context of public policy for over thirty years, publishing three books and more than 100 articles and book chapters. She recently completed a project funded by NICHD that examined the timing of and consequences of parenthood for men and women. Besides her deep knowledge of large national data bases, she has expertise in measurement, methods, and structural equation modeling. Her most recent book is the Handbook of Measurement Issues in Family Research. She is Principal Investigator on an NICHD-funded grant, the American Time Use Survey Data Extract System, which provides advanced extracting capabilities for seven years of time use data on individual time expenditures and on family time allocations to activities across a 24-hour period.  Research  Much of Hofferth's research focuses on children's time, including estimates of children's media, studying, and sports participation time as well as estimates of time children spend with their mothers and fathers. Results to date include large increases over the past 5‚Äì6 years in computer and video game use and declines in active sports participation and outdoor leisure activities among 6-12 year olds. She has also found evidence that early participation in sports (when children are 6-12) is associated with lower risk of overweight when they are 13-18. In the area of fathers and fathering, Hofferth completed two papers that examined the association between marital status, biological relationship of the father, involvement with children and child development (Journal of Marriage and the Family and Demography). Drawing from the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, these papers used innovative methods to test whether family structure differences in father involvement were due to selectivity of men into families or to actual differences in parenting. In the public policy area, Hofferth examined the impact of U.S. parental leave statutes on employment of new mothers after childbirth in a paper with S. Curtin (Work and Occupations 2006). Hofferth's work on welfare reform and public policy over the past decade is summarized in the Spring 2002 issue of Contexts: Understanding People in their Social Worlds, a journal of the American Sociological Association. Hofferth demonstrated that welfare reform policies, particularly the work requirement, contributed to the increased exits of single mothers from AFDC in the mid-1990s (Population Research and Policy Review 2002). Returns to public assistance tended to result from changes in personal circumstances rather than public policies (Social Science Research 2005). Hofferth, like many others, failed to find an effect of welfare reform policies such as family caps on nonmarital childbearing (Population Research and Policy Review 2006). Finally, Hofferth found no evidence of either poor children being more likely to be overweight or that food programs contribute to overweight among poor children (Journal of Policy Analysis and Management 2005).

It was built to compensate for the loss of parkland resulting from the construction of new Yankee Stadium between 2006 and 2009. The park‚Äôs name was inspired by a dam near the site of a creek that emptied into the Harlem River. Site use Known to the Lenape Native Americans as Mentipathe, Cromwell Creek originated in Morris Heights and flowed south towards Harlem River. Mullally Park and Macombs Dam Park were created in the late 19th century by filling in Cromwell Creek. The old Yankee Stadium was completed on the filled stream in 1923. On the Harlem River, landowner Robert Macomb built a dam in 1813 to harness the flow of the stream. Macomb's Dam enabled only small boats to pass through a lock. By 1838 residents along the riverbank questioned the private usurpation of the public waterway and a campaign to remove Macomb‚Äôs Dam succeeded in its demolition in 1858. The unpopular barrier was replaced with Macombs Dam Bridge, which connects 161st Street in the Bronx with 155th Street in Manhattan. On the site of Mill Pond Park, Mayor John F. Hylan proposed a wholesale market to concentrate all farm produce entering the Bronx at one location. The project was completed in 1935 during the administration of mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia. Along the Harlem River, railroad barges brought produce to the market, docking between four piers that were later incorporated into the park.

It is poisonous to livestock, and contaminates human food. Its original native range is unclear, probably including tropical Asia, Africa and Australia. It has been introduced as a crop plant in many tropical areas and has escaped from cultivation to become a troublesome weed; it is listed as a noxious weed in several US states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and is listed as an invasive weed in India, Cuba, and Cocos Island. Unlike some other species of Crotalaria, it is an annual plant. Description It is an annual herb, about high, with erect, angular, green branches. The soft leaves (dark green on the upper surface, lighter underneath) are alternate, and narrowly oblong or wedge-shaped. The yellow flowers grow widely spaced in racemes at the end of the stem. The pods are thin walled, and widely spaced along the stems, and when ripe are purple to black, containing about 18-20 small brown seeds. Habitat/ecology In Australia, where it is considered a native, it grows in the Kimberley on sand, clay, sandstone, and rocky basaltic soils, and is found along creeks and rivers, and on the floodplains. Uses Crotalaria retusa is grown as a fibre crop and as green manure. It is also used as a forage plant, but is poisonous to livestock. Toxins The primary source of toxicity for many species of Crotalaria is the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are poisonous to birds and large mammals. Crotalaria retusa seeds are some of the most toxic of Crotalaria species. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids in honey are a threat to human health. =Animals affected= In Australia, in the field, only horses are known to die from eating this plant, with most cases occurring during the wet season. Grazing on the fresh plant over a period of 3 or 4 weeks typically leads to death in about three months, from \\"Kimberley Horse Disease\\" (or \\"walkabout\\" disease). Death in chronic cases can take two or more years. First signs of poisoning are loss of weight, followed by sleepiness and depression. The horses then become irritable and start walking aimlessly until they die. In the U.S.A. the seeds have been found to be poisonous to chickens.

The park's name references three large arch bridges linking Manhattan and the Bronx: Alexander Hamilton Bridge, Washington Bridge, and High Bridge. History Land for this park was gradually acquired by the City of New York between 1884 and 2011. The oldest of the parcels was along the Bronx side of Washington Bridge, where winding trails and steps descended from the bridge's landing in the Morris Heights neighborhood to the Harlem River's shoreline. The bridge was conceived by Parks Commissioner Andrew Haswell Green. An early advocate of expanding the City of New York, he envisioned the bridge as symbolic of the unity between Manhattan and the Bronx. The bridge was completed in 1889 and was named after the country's first president on the centennial of his inauguration. The construction of Major Deegan Expressway (I-87) in 1939 and Cross-Bronx Expressway (I-95) in 1955 greatly reduced some of the parkland on the Harlem River shoreline in favor of highway ramps connecting Washington Bridge to the two highways. Located on a narrow property between the water's edge and the Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line, the park is located on a site that was originally an illegal dump and a dog pound. The area was difficult to access, and undeveloped until the City decided to develop unused waterfronts as linear parks connecting distant neighborhoods and providing opportunities to launch canoes and learn about wildlife living in Harlem River. In May 2015, the strip along the Bronx side of Harlem River opened to the public as Bridge Park. Bridge Park connects to Roberto Clemente State Park to its north. Current status The master plan for Bridge Park includes passive and active recreational facilities and educational structures including a boathouse and canoe launch at the water's edge; a greenhouse, garden and picnic grove further inland, as well as a performance space and bike trails. Bridge Park's development is ongoing with community input on its design and acquisition of land to connect it with other parks on the Harlem River shoreline.

New York City. Its namesake is Francis J. Barretto, a 19th-century merchant and State Assemblyman who lived in the area.  History  Barretto Point Park from Tiffany Street Pier The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation acquired the property in 2001 from the City‚Äôs Department of Environmental Protection, and the park opened to the public in 2006. The land on which the park was created was remediated and capped to make sure it was clean and safe. Prior to 1950, the site housed a sand and gravel operation and an asphalt plant. Between 1954 and 1978, the placement of fill on the site increased the size of the upland. Floating Pool Barge in Barretto Point Park Since 2008, Barretto Point Park has been host to a barge named The Floating Pool Lady. The 20,000 square-foot vessel contains an outdoor 25-meter swimming pool with a pool house; locker rooms with showers; bathrooms; a children‚Äôs spray shower; a gangplank leading to and from the barge; and other amenities, including a small amphitheater.  Landscape  The landscape of Barretto Point Park recalls the rustic atmosphere that once characterized Hunts Point and provides a popular outdoor gathering space for its residents. The park is accessible from the East River by canoe and kayak, and provides views of the North and South Brother Islands, which are bird sanctuaries with histories that span three centuries. The islands themselves are closed to the public. Tiffany Street Pier Tiffany Street Pier near Barretto Point Park, with North Brother and South Brother islands in the distance To the immediate west of Barretto Point Park is the Tiffany Street Pier, a recreational space that predates the park and also offers views of the bird sanctuary islands in the East River. Previously used as a loading dock, it became popular with recreational fishermen and local residents in search of a quiet space on the waterfront. In 1995, the city rebuilt the pier out of an innovative material produced from 1.5 million recycled plastic bottles. The hard plastic structure can withstand damage caused by wood boring marine insects but it succumbed to damage from the sky when a lightning strike in September 1996 melted a third of the pier, including its gazebo. The pier reopened in 2000 and in the following year, the City‚Äôs Department of Citywide Administrative Services assigned the pier and surrounding underwater parcels to Parks.Martinez, Jose ‚ÄúMelted Pier Reborn\\" New York Daily News June 12, 2000 Although at the time, the pier was a considerable walk from residential sections of Hunts Point, it again welcomed individuals seeking fishing, sunbathing and a view of the water.

Hezekiah was a poor black farmer, who worked his two acres of land; but, he also saved up for and read books. The white folks thereabouts thought him harmless enough, but that \\"reading ain't no good for an ignorant nigger\\". Reverend Green, of the white man's church, visited him and asked if he believed in the Lord, the church, and Heaven. Hezekiah replied, that he'd never seen the Lord; that the church was divided; and that he tried to be as good as he could without expecting anything from Heaven or the Lord. The poem was a signature piece of the American stage performer Lord Buckley. A live performance, in which he speaks the words over a solo female voice singing and humming the spiritual \\"Kumbaya\\" and a sparse instrumental accompaniment, is included on his 1959 album Way Out Humor, re-released in 1964 as Lord Buckley in Concert. Early in his career, Bob Dylan performed the poem, in slightly shortened form, as a spoken piece with guitar accompaniment in a style based on that of Lord Buckley. Two amateur recordings exist: on one of the Minnesota Hotel Tapes, December 1961, and on the Second Gaslight Tape, October 1962. The Minnesota performance was released on the 1969 bootleg album Great White Wonder, and has since been included in other unofficial compilations. The Gaslight performance was released on the unofficial 1985 album Gaslight Tapes.

After an hour of action Didon surrendered to Phoenix. The battle-scarred HMS Phoenix and Didon shortly after their engagement on 10 August 1805, depicted by Thomas Whitcombe Background Thomas Baker took command of HMS Phoenix on 28 April 1803.Tracy (2006), 20. He was assigned to the Channel Fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis, and on 10 August 1805 he came across the 40-gun French frigate off Cape Finisterre.Tracy (2006), 20 Prior to the sighting Phoenix had intercepted an American merchant, en route from Bordeaux to the United States. The American master had been invited onto Phoenix, sold the British some of his cargo of wine, and had toured Phoenix before being allowed to continue on his way. Phoenix had at this time been altered to resemble from a distance a large sloop-of-war. Didon, which was carrying despatches instructing Rear-Admiral Zacharie Allemand's five ships of the line to unite with the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, intercepted the American merchant and from him received news that a 20-gun British ship was at sea and might be foolish enough to attack Didon. Didons commander, Captain Captain Pierre Milius, decided to await the arrival of the British ship, and take her as a prize. Battle HMS Phoenix in chase of Didon On 10 August 1805, the two vessels met off Cape Finisterre. Phoenix was able to approach and engage Didon before the French realised that she was a larger frigate than they had anticipated. At 8am Didon hoisted French colours and an hour later the fighting commenced. Didon opened fire upon Phoenix still coming down but Phoenix made no return and Captain Baker intended to pass and engage to leeward of the French ship. In the meantime Didon raked the British frigate while Baker therefore determined to close with his adversary. Phoenix ranged up alongside Didon and engaged within pistol shot but was to far windward and having too much way upon her soon drew ahead of the French ship. Didon took advantage of this by luffing across the stern of Phoenix and poured in a raking broadside. She then bore up and again raked Phoenix and was about to do this again but Baker counteracted the movement. The French crew then made a vigorous but unsuccessful attempt to board in which the Royal Marines were able to repel the French boarders. After this had lasted about three quarters of an hour a breeze sprung up and caused Didon to forge ahead by which more guns from Phoenix were brought to bear and they became again engaged broadside to broadside. The superiority of the fire of Phoenix however soon began to tell and after a short time the two ships separated. Phoenix, having repaired her damages, was about to renew the action when Didons foremast soon toppled over. This caused more damage to the already damaged foremast leaving her an unmanageable wreck. With this situation and the heavy casualties Didon soon struck her colours at . The action lasted several hours, with Baker on one occasion having his hat shot off his head. Phoenix had twelve killed and 28 wounded; the French sustained losses of 27 killed and 44 wounded. Consequences By intercepting the ship carrying the despatches for Allemand, Baker had unwittingly played a role in bringing about the Battle of Trafalgar, but he was to play an even greater role a few days later, possibly even staving off an invasion of England. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General service Medal with clasp \\"Phoenix 10 Augt. 1805\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. While sailing to Gibraltar with his prize in tow, Baker fell in with the 74-gun on 14 August. The following day the combined fleet under Villeneuve, heading for Brest and then on to Boulogne to escort the French invasion forces across the Channel sighted the three British ships. Villeneuve mistook the British ships for scouts from the Channel Fleet and fled south to avoid an action. A furious Napoleon raged 'What a Navy! What an admiral! All those sacrifices for nought!' Villeneuve's failure to press north was a decisive point of the Trafalgar Campaign as far as the invasion of England went, for abandoning all hope of fulfilling his plans to secure control of the Channel Napoleon gathered the Arm√©e d'Angleterre, now renamed the Grande Arm√©e, and headed east to attack the Austrians in the Ulm Campaign. The British ships altered their course and made for Plymouth, where they arrived on 3 September, having prevented an attempt by their French prisoners to capture Phoenix and retake Didon.

They captured and burned a fort and then captured a number of ships which included two prizes with only light losses. Events Commander James Richard Dacres in the Dacres 24-gun HMS Bacchante had been sailing off the French occupied part of Santo Domingo in early 1807. On 14 February 1807, Bacchante captured the French navy schooner Dauphin off Cape Raphael after a 10-hour chase. Dauphin mounted one log 12-pounder gun and two 4-pounders, but she threw the 4-pounders overboard during the chase. She had a crew of 71 men and Dacres was extremely happy to have captured her as she had been preying successfully on British trade. He then fell in with Captain Wise and in the Mona Passage. Both were patrolling, looking for French warships and privateers, so Dacres took Mediator under his command and hatched a plan to raid the port of Samana, \\"that nest of privateers\\". Dacres had Dauphin come into the harbour there under her French flag, with Bacchante disguised as her prize, and Mediator, a former merchantman, appearing to be a neutral ship. This stratagem permitted the British vessels to navigate into the harbour and anchor within a half a mile of the fort before the French realized that they were British vessels. A four-hour exchange of fire with a fort manned primarily by men from the privateers in the harbour then commenced. Soon after the fort was assaulted in a land attack by the seamen and Royal Marines from Bacchante and Mediator, the landing party being under Wise's command. The fort was captured and soon the French fled. The British consolidated their position and captured two French schooners undergoing fitting as privateers, and an American ship (George Washington, whose cargo of coffee was still aboard her) and a British schooner, both prizes to French privateers. Before they left on 21 February, the British destroyed the fort and its guns and plundered the settlement taking anything of value. In the attack, Dacres had four men wounded while Wise had two men killed and twelve wounded as Mediator had been more heavily engaged than Bacchante in the exchange of fire with the fort. Dacres estimated that French casualties had been high, but did not have a number as the Frenchmen took to the woods as the fort fell. The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund, subsequently awarded both Dacres and Wise a sword each worth ¬£100 that bore the inscriptions: * \\"From the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's to James Richard Dacres Esqr.

History SNAPP was founded as a partnership between The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California, Santa Barbara. It was launched at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2013 in response to global challenges including rapid population growth, climate change and economic development. Activities SNAPP funds, convenes and supports Expert Working Groups addressing global challenges in four focus areas: *Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Benefits *Food Security and Nature *Water Security and Nature *Community Resilience and Climate Change SNAPP has 34 working groups working across the world, each with a specific problem to address in 24 months. These are supported by organizations like the World Bank, NGOs like Mercy Corps, and businesses like Swiss Re. =Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Benefits= Ivory Trade On September 25, 2015, the Chinese government announced a ban on its domestic ivory trade, for which 22,000 elephants are killed each year. The announcement later lead to a drop in ivory prices. The SNAPP Chinese Ivory Trade Working Group is conducting the first comprehensive analysis of the industry to support the government with implementing the ban. Natural Capital Accounting Working Group The Natural Capital Accounting Working Group is working with the government of Rwanda in support of the country's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategies, Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans, and Poverty and Environment Initiatives. Evidence-based Conservation This group, including experts from Conservation International, European Centre for Environment and Human Health, and the World Bank, has assessed the evidence base for how conservation benefits human well-being, for example health and education. The study was published in Nature. =Food Security and Nature= Sustainable Aquaculture Experts including from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Stanford University are establishing the food production capacity of sustainable aquaculture, and working with industry and governments to develop best practice guidelines for the growing industry. Fisheries Measures Led by Ray Hilborn of the University of Washington, this group is working on improving understanding of the current status of key fish stocks. They are also systematically identifying factors that lead to good outcomes in fisheries management. Data-Limited Fisheries Studies have proven that fisheries with reliable stock assessments tend to be better managed, but this accounts for less than 1% of fisheries worldwide. To counteract the extensive overfishing practices that threaten the health of many of the world's fish stocks, the Data-Limited Fisheries Working Group examines how new, inexpensive approaches to assess data-limited fisheries can be globally implemented. Sustainable Agriculture The Sustainable Agriculture Working Group examines how agricultural output can be intensified sustainably in the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT), which links eastern Zambia and the interior of Tanzania to the Indian Ocean. =Water Security and Nature= Ecological Drought Supported by the United States Geological Survey, the Ecological Drought Working Group is synthesizing the latest scientific understanding of long-term drought in the western US for federal, state and local governments, and businesses. Sharing Water The Sharing Water Working Group is identifying the costs and benefits of multi- objective water agreements in 2-4 pilot watersheds in the Western United States. =Community Resilience and Climate Change= Coastal Defenses At present, millions of dollars are spent on artificial cement coastal barriers that fail to provide long-term disaster protection and further harm damaged ecosystems. The Coastal Defenses Working Group has built a database of projects around the world that use green infrastructure and their approaches and cost-effectiveness. With the assistance of the World Bank, the project will identify where nature has the greatest value in defending the world's coasts.

History  The school was founded in 1895 by Abbot Theobald Grasb√∂ck as an all-boys boarding school following the typical Cistercian tradition of monastic schools in Wilhering that can be traced back to the year 1580. In 1904 it was acknowledged by the Imperial-Royal Ministry of Culture and Education as private school under public law. Being home for several intellectuals resisting Nazism, the school was closed after the German Annexation of Austria in 1938 but reopened immediately after the World War II in 1945. In 1980 Wilhering College first admitted girls to lessons and is now fully coeducational. The boarding home was closed in 1990.

In 1286, Cardinal Goffredo became Podest√† of Alatri, and he served in this office as town mayor until his death. On his death, the town descended into anarchy. Conclave of 1287 and Death Pope Honorius IV died on Holy Thursday, 3 April 1287, at his palace next to Santa Sabina on the Aventine. There were sixteen cardinals at the time of his death, and they would have assembled for a conclave in mid-April. However, Cardinal Comes Giusiani de Casati died on 7 or 8 April. During the next several months nearly all the cardinals became ill, and several more died: Hugh of England (died July 28), Gervaise of Paris, Giordano Orsini, Geoffrey de Bar, and Goffredo da Alatri. The cardinals scattered to recuperate, first to their own residences, and finally to hilltop towns in the neighborhood of Rome. The conclave was forgotten until the cold of winter ended the pestilence which had been afflicting Rome, probably mosquito-borne malarial fever. It was only in mid-February, 1288, that the surviving Cardinals reassembled; there were seven electors left: Latino Malabranca, Bentivenga de Bentivengis, Girolamo Masci, Bernard de Languissel, Matteo Rosso Orsini, Giacomo Colonna, and Benedetto Caetani. They elected Girolamo Masci, O. Min. as Nicholas IV on February 22. But Cardinal Goffredo was already dead before 31 May 1287. Cardinal Goffredo possessed fifty-two books at his death, according to the inventory of his property made on 31 May 1287, of which twenty-three were juridical in nature.M.

This turn of events provoked outcry in part of the Serbian people because the creation of Banovina of Croatia didn't resolve the so-called Serbian issue. Protests followed, mostly organized or incited by Serbian Cultural Club which demanded revision of Cvetkoviƒá-Maƒçek agreement, that is, border revision of the newly formed Banovina of Croatia. Serbian Cultural Club claimed that the agreement wasn't signed by all Serb representatives but was in fact the result of bargain struck between the crown and representatives of CPP.–°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏ –∫—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∏ –∫–ª—É–± Map of Banovina of Croatia, 1939 Through its newspaper, the \\"Serbian Voice\\", Serbian Cultural Club, by means of different articles presented opinion on necessity of Serb political autonomy in Banovina of Croatia (in 19 of counties where Serbs were absolute or relative majority) or alternatively, separation from Banovina of Croatia and addition to other Banovina level units that were to enter Banovina of Serbia later on. To implement this, Serbian Cultural Club formed its subcommittees on territory of east Slavonija, Srem, Bosanska Posavina and in the final months of 1939. started collecting signatures for separation of Ilok, ≈†id and Vukovar county from Banovina of Croatia.  Historical, geographical and other resolution reasons = Historical reasons = As main reasons for the resolution, the document itself names the historical reasons: \\"For many years, Vukovar was the seat of the Syrmia County. Together with Banat and Baƒçka, Syrmia forms Serbian Vojvodina. This is irrefutable, because even the national spirit attests to it through song \\"Syrmia, Banat and Baƒçka, the three courageous hearts\\". We had Serb majority in Vukovar county for several centuries now. Different sources confirm this; for example, one modern German writer from the first half of 18th century says: \\"Orthodox believers built their church in 1731. for which 50.000 bricks were requested from local nobility. Their requests were easily met for they made the majority of county population and their religion was tolerated as they already had one older church in Vukovar. Furthermore, they benefited from poor demand for the landowner brick. Summoned by Syrmia- Karlovci metropolitan Vikentije Jovanoviƒá, Russians teachers arrived to educate the Serbian youth and one of those teachers stayed in Sremski Karlovci while others leave for Belgrade and Vukovar, so they can find schools there. The fact that in 1733. Timitej Levandovski went to Vukovar and started a Serbian school shows how, even then, Vukovar represented a strong Serbian cultural center. It remained as such through history to the present day. Vukovar gave the first Serbian journalist and polyglot, Zaharije Stefanoviƒá Orfelin, predecessor to the Dositej Obradoviƒá. \\"Dobra Voda\\", Vukovar picnic resort, where most notable Serbs from Syrmia regularly gathered near the little church of St.Paraskeva, was where Branko Radiƒçeviƒá found inspiration for his poems. Svetozar Miletiƒá, returning from Vac, first stops by in Vukovar to visit the Serbian political centar of Syrmia. These examples are not unique, many others can be added to the list. Cultural and educational Serbian societies even today mention Vukovar Serbs action.\\" = Geographical reasons = According to the signatures of the resolution, Vukovar, in economic sense \\"absolutely and solely gravitates towards Novi Sad and creates one economic unit with Syrmia...Only applicable authority in matters of price regulation of commercial goods on Vukovar market is the stock exchange of Novi Sad. The only place where a farmer from Vukovar county can buy his tools is Novi Sad. The economic structure of the Vukovar county is identical with that of Danbue Banovina. = Political reasons = Signatories of the resolution stated that Vukovar has always a single political whole with rest of the Syrmia, that is, Danube Banovine back then: \\"Croats and their political parties didn't once win an election majority in this county, therefore neither was the political representative theirs. During the campaign for the political reorganization of the country, it was requested from the Croats that they honor specific historical individuality. If this individuality was to be taken into an account, Vukovar could be added to the Vojvodina\\". Likewise, it was stated that according to the census from 1931. Vukovar county had 51.334 citizens. 26.342 were Serbs, 11.893 were Croats while the rest was comprised from national minorities (Germans, Hungarians, Russians/Rusyns, Czechs, Slovaks, Jews...), therefore, Vukovar county, as an area populated mostly with Serbs had no reason or basis to remain part of Banovina of Croatia.

It records the period of German occupation of Rome in the Second World War and its subsequent liberation. The building housing the museum was used by the SS to torture members of the Italian Resistance in the first half of 1944.  History  Following completion of the building in the late 1930s, it was rented to the German Embassy in Rome and initially used as that embassy's Cultural Office. The headquarters of the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo), an agency of the SS, led by Herbert Kappler, were established there from 11 September 1943 and occupied the building until the German retreat from Rome. Under Kappler it was transformed into a prison, with the rooms being turned into cells. In January 1944 all windows were walled up to facilitate imprisonment, interrogations and torture of some of the most important figures of the Italian resistance, with an estimated 2000 people passing through the building. On 4 June 1944, the day of the Liberation of Rome, the population entered the building and freed those prisoners who had not been taken and subsequently murdered by the retreating SS. Following donation of the apartments occupied by the SS to the Italian State in 1950 the museum was established to record the period of German occupation and Rome's subsequent liberation. The donation, by Princess Josepha Ruspoli in Savorgnan di Brazz√†, specifically required the rooms to be used as a museum for that purpose. After an initial opening of a few rooms in 1955 by the Italian President Giovanni Gronchi, it was definitively opened in 1957. Sources of materials for the exhibition included Gestapo files and documents provided by the people of Rome, particularly those associated with the resistance. On the night between 22 and 23 November 1999 there was an explosion outside the museum that caused some slight damage. This attempt was believed to have been anti-Semitic in nature. On the following 8 December, 3500 people demonstrated outside the museum in solidarity. In 2007, the nearby metro station of Manzoni was renamed Manzoni - Museo della Liberazione in honour of the museum.  The museum  The museum occupies three floors. In addition to recording the torture that took place on the site, it details the persecution of Rome's Jews, with copies of newspaper reports and posters imposing bans and anti-Jewish orders. It also covers the underground struggle, exhibiting manifestos and handbills of the resistance. It provides information about those imprisoned in Via Tasso and pays particular attention to the Ardeatine Massacre when some of the 335 victims were taken from the prisons of Via Tasso. In some of the cells writings in pencil on the plaster and other graffiti provide touching messages of life and freedom, often written by prisoners nearing death. Via Tasso 145, Rome.

The rooms  * Ground floor In addition to the reception area the ground floor has a conference room and a library, which is particularly devoted to the resistance and contains a large number of rare pamphlets and newspapers related to the period. * First floor This contains five cells. Cell 1, the largest, concerns the Ardeatine Massacre. Cell 2 was used for solitary confinement. This, and one on the upper floor, was not covered with wallpaper and displays evidence of messages scratched in the plaster by the prisoners. Cell 3 is devoted to Forte Bravetta, a location on Rome's Janiculum that was used by the Germans for executions, and to the people who died there. Cell 4 remembers the 14 prisoners taken by the SS when they retreated from Rome, and their execution at La Storta on 4 June 1944. Cell 5 was a kitchen converted into an isolation unit.

She is Cree-M√©tis and a member of the As'in'i'wa'chi Ni'yaw Nation Rocky Mountain Cree. She won the Governor General's Gold Medal with her dissertation on \\"Critical Indigenous Legal Theory,\\" and her academic work has awarded her a Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Traditional Knowledge. Lindberg works with Elders and Spiritual Leaders in Indigenous communities to record and translate Indigenous laws. She spent nineteen years teaching at Athabasca University in Alberta before moving to the University of Ottawa. Her debut novel, Birdie, was published in 2015 and is a national best-seller.\\"Law of the land: Tracey Lindberg's debut novel, Birdie, puts Cree poetics in the spotlight\\". National Post, June 15, 2015. It presents the path of healing through the main character, Bernice Meetos, a Cree woman who is trying to reconcile with her tragic past. It has been said that Birdie demonstrates the effects of colonization, intergenerational trauma on Indigenous families and speaks to the universal story of self-discovery. The novel was selected for the 2016 edition of Canada Reads, where it was defended by entrepreneur Bruce Poon Tip.\\"Meet the Canada Reads 2016 contenders\\". CBC Books, January 18, 2016. The novel was also a finalist for an Alberta Literary Award, the Kobo Emerging Writer Prize and a long-listed selection of the International DUBLIN Literary Award Lindberg also performs as a blues music singer.http://indigenous.athabascau.ca/faculty/tlindberg/  Education  Lindberg received her bachelor of law University of Saskatchewan, masters in law at Harvard University, and doctorate in law the University of Ottawa. She was the first Indigenous woman in Canada to complete her graduate law degree at Harvard University. She is also thought to be the first Indigenous woman to receive a doctorate in law from a Canadian university. = Early writing = Lindberg's literary works demonstrate the importance of Indigenous tradition, resiliency, and how narratives can empower marginalized populations. Lindberg's written work includes essays and dissertations on Indigenous governance, Indigenous Feminism and traditional Indigenous education.  Career (1997-2018)  In 1997, Dr. Lindberg was hired to teach Criminal Justice at Athabasca University in Alberta. In 2001, she helped to establish the Centre for World Indigenous Knowledge and Research and became director of Indigenous Education. In 2010 she became Athabasca's fourth Canadian Research Chair. Her focus was on Indigenous Legal Orders, Laws and Traditions. At this point she began to split her time between Athabasca University and the University of Ottawa and transferred there full-time in 2016. Lindberg is a professor of Indigenous law and government at the University of Ottawa. She was co-author of the 2012 academic text Discovering Indigenous Lands: The Doctrine of Discovery in the English Colonies.\\"The Doctrine of Discovery and Indigenous Peoples\\". Oxford University Press, August 9, 2012. Lindberg's areas of research include traditional Cree law, legal advocacy, and activism for Indigenous people, as well as Indigenous women. In addition to teaching at the University of Ottawa, she teaches at the Native Law Program and has written/taught courses about Aboriginal business law, Indigenous women, and courses on dispute resolution. = Faculty of Law = At the University of Ottawa, Lindberg is an associate professor of the Faculty of Law. Her work in academia and law has informed other non-Indigenous lawyers and professionals on Indigenous legal theory. Lindberg's passion for re-traditionalizing Indigenous law is noted in her analysis of how Canadian practice violates Indigenous governance. Within the Faculty of Law at UOttawa, the Common Law Section offered an Indigenous Law Program for the first time in September 2016. Lindberg and other professors taught sections such as, Indigenous legal principles, criminal property, and constitutional law. This course at UOttawa is called \\"Maanaajitoon/Torts,\\" which includes components of Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Dene, and M√©tis Law. = Academia = After her Governor General's (GG) Award in 2007, Lindberg continued to publish work that addressed the importance of Indigenous Rights and traditional practices. Many of her publications have appeared in co-edited books with other distinguished recipients of the GG Awards, such as Kim Campbell and Robert Bourassa. = Reconciliation (2016) = Much of Lindberg's academic work deals with the multi-layered issue of reconciliation for Indigenous communities with Canada. In 2016, Lindberg delivered a speech called, (W)rec(k)-onciliation: Indigenous Lands and Peoples' Respect, Reciprocity and Relationships. It was presented at Vancouver Island University's second annual event for Pre-Confederation Treaties and Reconciliation. Her approach to reconciliation focuses on a complex process with many factors involved, rather than a linear process. Lindberg incorporates reconciliation through her work in the community and through her written work, both literary and fictional. Douglas White, who is a Director of the Centre for Pre-Confederation Treaties and Reconciliation, admires Lindberg's perspective on reconciliation. In 2017, Lindberg appeared at The Indigenous Writers' Gathering, which facilitates reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people through the sharing of Indigenous literature. It was part of the IndigenousReads Campaign and encompassed discussions with many accomplished Indigenous authors who shared their perspectives on overcoming adversity and building resistance.  Activism  Lindberg's social and political activism in Indigenous law, governance, education, reconciliation, and with Indigenous women, has awarded her the position as an Associate Professor in the Centre for World Indigenous Knowledge and Research. In 2018, she spoke at the first Indigenous-led summit that focused on building solutions and promoting healing from the effects of the Indian Act. The summit, determiNATION: Moving Beyond the Indian Act brought together Elders, spiritual leaders, Indigenous youth, scholars, and the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations to speak to issues impacting Indigenous communities. Lindberg has given presentations on the strength of survivors of abuse that also come up in her book Birdie. She advocates for the narratives of Indigenous peoples to be recognized, especially for Indigenous women and their cultural identities. Her work includes advocating on behalf of Indigenous youth, where she focuses on empowerment and teaching the importance of Indigenous language and story telling. Lindberg's political activism focuses on the complexities of reconciliation for Indigenous people. In 2017, her lecture at Vancouver Island University's Indigenous Speaker Series was called (W)rec(k)-onciliation, to show the prevalence of institutionalized racism and how there is still work to be done in order to advance the reconciliation of Indigenous people with Canada. = Indigenous women's legal advocacy = Lindberg advocates for Indigenous women, due to the fact that many narratives about Indigenous women have been used to impair their agency, knowledge, and present them in destructive ways. She targets this issue by writing counter-narratives, in order reclaim the socio-cultural stories in regard to Indigenous women's history, which can be seen in her work. Lindberg's Indigenous Women's Legal Advocacy provides an anti-colonial approach to legal assistance and provides proper representation for Indigenous women. = Missing and murdered Indigenous women = Lindberg has also focused on the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada and the United States with her article, \\"Violence against Indigenous women and the case of Cindy Gladue,\\" published in 2015. The article gives agency to families of the missing and murdered and addresses the systemic violence that has impacted Indigenous women. = Survivors of sexual violence = In addition to Lindberg's work with Indigenous women, she works with women of many backgrounds who have experienced sexual violence. In 2018, she facilitated a workshop at Carleton University called \\"Survivors Writing Circle,\\" which teaches writing as a tool for healing and recovery for survivors of sexual violence.  Birdie (2015)  Birdie, published in 2015 was Lindberg's debut novel and has been said to fill the gaps of what Canadian literature has been missing. Majority of Canadian literature has overlooked Indigenous women writers, especially novels about the experiences of Indigenous women. [Birdie provides resurgence and representation for Indigenous women and validity of their experiences, as well as the journey of self-discovery. Not only does Lindberg's novel focus on the experiences of Indigenous women, it also offers a universal story of healing and recovery. Birdie is enriched with elements of Cree culture which incorporate storytelling, tradition, and language. Lindberg purposely disrupts the chronological order of time and challenges the linear order, as most of the story takes place from Bernice Meetoos's bed in an almost dream state, shifting between the past and present. Many reviews have said that Birdie challenges Canada's dark history in regard to the colonization of Indigenous peoples, in contrast to Canada being seen for its image of national kindness. = Indigenous women = Lindberg gives agency to the voices of Indigenous women as she presents the journey of Bernice Meetoos, a Cree-M√©tis woman who becomes withdrawn from the present in order to work through her traumatic past. Throughout her novel, Lindberg encourages people to be responsible for one another, which opens up an honest dialogue and begins the conversation of reconciliation. This novel addresses the epidemic of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and girls in North America, and the economic and social inequities in Indigenous communities. = Cree Poetic Aesthetics = Lindberg uses Cree Poetic Aesthetics throughout her novel with the use of traditional song, Cree Language, Cree law, and humor. In Cree Poetic Aesthetics, Lindberg uses the technique of narrative to give identity to Indigenous people in Canadian literature. The way in which Lindberg constructs her sentences, translates Cree language, inserts politically charged words, and uses self-reflection of the main character demonstrate many of the linguistic tools that re-claim Indigenous identity. Lindberg uses Plains Cree language by translating Cree into English in footnotes. She also reclaims certain racial derogatives through re-appropriation. = Cree Law = Wahkohtowin  Lindberg uses the relational tool of Cree Law in her novel Birdie. It is based on the principle that we are all bound by the universe and have a reciprocal obligation to treat one another with care. The law is called Wahkohtowin; Lindberg wanted to use this to explore the intimate bond we have with one another, on a human level. = Introduction of Birdie in High Schools = Bruce Poon Tip was on the panel of the 2016 Canada Reads Competition and was Birdie's defender. He saw Birdie as a piece of work that encompasses Indigenous resistance to colonization. This motivated him to introduce the novel into High Schools, in which his first project launched 10, 000 copies into High Schools. Bruce Poon Tip sees Birdie as a way to encourage people to re-traditionalize and de-colonize.  Awards  Lindberg received a Best Book award from the National Post in 2015. She was also a finalist for Canada Reads in 2016. Lindberg received the Governor General's Award in 2007 upon convocation for her dissertation in Critical Indigenous Legal Theory. Lindberg's academic work awarded her a Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Traditional Knowledge, Legal Orders, and Law. Lindberg's 2015 (Novel)Birdie was a national best seller, a CBC Canada Reads finalist, a best book of the year, a finalist for an Alberta Literary Award and the Kobo Emerging Writer Prize, and a long listed selection of the International DUBLIN Literary Award. Lindberg was also named a CBC \\"writer to watch\\". In 2018, Lindberg was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

He is married to the American musicologist Bonnie J. Blackburn. Career After Southgate County Grammar School, in 1963 Holford- Strevens went up to Christ Church, Oxford, to read Literae Humaniores (a form of classical studies), and stayed on to obtain his doctorate there with a dissertation entitled Select Commentary on Aulus Gellius, Book 2 (1971). In 1971 Holford-Strevens started work with the Oxford University Press as a graduate proof reader and later rose to become consultant scholar-editor there. His first book-length publication, Aulus Gellius, was published in 1988. Holford-Strevens's book was hailed by Hugh Lloyd-Jones as a masterpiece characterized by a \\"sharp critical intelligence\\". More generally, Lloyd-Jones stated that Holford-Strevens was one of the most learned men in England, comparing him to Sebastiano Timpanaro, who also managed to combine a career in a publishing house with world-class contributions to scholarship. Numerous anecdotes circulate concerning his mannerisms, from his being barred from a college dining room on account of what were called his \\"mediaeval eating manners\\" to his ability to navigate streets while buried in The Times, and yet managing to miss running into lampposts. Another anecdote suggests that W. H. Auden once called on dons entertaining him in Oxford to stop chatting, explaining that he wished to listen to Holford-Strevens's conversation as he held forth in another corner of the room. By the time of his retirement in 2011, Holford-Strevens had proof-read or edited over 500 books, and in retirement he is still active and is working on a new commentary on Gellius. He lives in St Bernard's Road, Oxford. His work as a copy-editor was recognized in 2016 by the award of the British Academy President's Medal for outstanding service to the cause of the humanities and social sciences. Languages Holford-Strevens's interest in languages was stimulated by his father, a company secretary, who introduced him at an early age to French, Spanish, and German. He learnt Russian as a young boy out of curiosity when the Sputnik was launched in 1957, desiring to match a classmate who wished to know the tongue of the people who managed the technological feat. According to Sir Keith Thomas, his ability to read forty languages made him a legendary figure at Oxford. He reads all the Romance languages.

Courage Is Contagious is often compared to the 1957 book Profiles in Courage by John F. Kennedy, then a United States Senator planning to run for president, profiled acts of political heroism by eight United States Senators. Kasich wrote Courage Is Contagious as a United States Representative contemplating running for the Presidency, which he did in the early Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000. In contrast with Kennedy's book, Kasich's book describes the lives of ordinary Americans who perform extraordinary feats of public service. Kasich says that he wrote the book after being asked by a conservative think tank to write a book about government budgets but decided to write a more inspirational book instead. The book highlights the surging popularity of volunteering in charitable and civic improvement activities of all kinds. Royalties from the book were donated to fund the work of the men and women who Kasich had profiled. Courage Is Contagious was a New York Times bestseller in November and December 1998.
