Debutante cotillions were traditional coming of age celebrations for eligible young ladies ready to be presented to society as ready for marriage. Required rules of dress A young lady's gown was regulated by a set of meticulously defined rules which were strictly enforced. These rules varied from monarchy to monarchy and didn't always follow the fashion of the time. White was the preferred color for her gown, although soft colors such as ivory or eggshell were acceptable as long as they were over a white background. The headdress always included feathers and a veil although the number and size of the feathers varied with the time. Married women wore a tiara. Georgian era During the reign of King George III and Queen Charlotte, the debutante dress featured a hoop skirt and elaborate trimmings which included a single ostrich plume worn on the head, even though simple dresses with high waists were favored. During the reign of King George IV, the hoop skirt was excluded and the style for a debutante gown became a variation of whatever was considered popular for formal evening wear during the period. Victorian era A debutante dress ca. 1890 D√©butante dresses were almost always short-sleeved and had to have a low neckline. However a doctor's certificate could be presented at the time stating that low cut was injurious to the young woman's health. After a d√©butante married, if she had married appropriately, she would be re-presented at Court as a married woman, usually wearing her wedding dress with alterations. Queen Victoria was said to have hated small feathers, so orders were sent out that Her Majesty wished to see the feathers as the young lady approached. Late in Queen Victoria's reign and into the court of Edward VII, the necessary headdress was three feathers arranged in a Prince of Wales plume. A center feather slightly higher than the two on each side worn slightly on the left side of the head. For young ladies and women to be presented who were in mourning, it was acceptable for their dresses and veils to be black. No matter how cold the weather was on this special day, absolutely no cloaks, shawls, capes, or wraps of any kind were permitted to be worn. Those items remained in the lady's carriage.

Six held consulships in the period from 261 BC to 86 BC; one also held a censorship. Lucius Valerius Flaccus, consul 261 BC He was a consul in 261 BC with Tiberius Otacilius Crassus. He was possibly the ancestor of all later consuls by that name, since he marks the first appearance of a Lucius Valerius Flaccus on the list of consuls.A Lucius Valerius Flaccus had been magister equitum in 321 BC (Livy 8.18.13), but nothing else is known of the man. He and his consular colleague waged war in Sicily.Polybius 1.20.3‚Äì7, cf. Diodorus Siculus 23.9; Frontinus, Stratagems 3.16.3; Zonaras 8.10, as cited by T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1951, 1986), vol. 1, p. 204. Lucius Valerius Flaccus, consul 195 BC He was a consul in 195 BC and censor in 183 BC, serving both times with his great friend Cato the Elder, whom he brought to the notice of the Roman political elite. L. Valerius Flaccus, consul 152 BC Possibly son of the consul in 195 BC. Or the Plebeian Tribune who spoke for the repeal of the Oppian Law. L. Valerius Flaccus, consul 131 BC Another Lucius Valerius Flaccus became consul in 131 BC, with Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus. He was flamen Martialis at the time, and so was forbidden by his co-consul and religious superior, as Pontifex Maximus since 132 BC, from taking the army to Asia Minor to fight the usurper Aristonicus. Furthermore, Flaccus was fined by his co-consul. Mucianus was supported by the people of Rome who wished Flaccus to obey the ruling of the Pontifex, but they remitted the fine. Ironically, Mucianus himself violated prior taboos by leaving Italy with an army, something his kinsman the consul of 205 BC had refused to do more than seventy years earlier. The subsequent political career or life of this Lucius Valerius Flaccus is unknown. L. Valerius Flaccus, consul 100 BC Another L. Valerius Flaccus, apparently son of the consul of 131 BC,Smith: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology Ed. 1849, Vol. 2, p. 158 was consul in 100 BC along with Gaius Marius. In 97 BC, he served as censor alongside Marcus Antonius. Flaccus was made princeps senatus in 86. During the civil war, he worked for agreement between Sulla and the Cinnan government at Rome. Eventually, he joined Sulla's side and secured his election as dictator, for which Flaccus was rewarded with the post of magister equitum. Flaccus does not appear further, and is presumed to have died soon after. Like his father, this Lucius Valerius Flaccus was also a Flamen Martialis.Francis X. Ryan, Rank and Participation in the Republican Senate (Franz Steiner Verlag, 1998), p. 192 online. L. Valerius Flaccus, suffect consul 86 BC Another L. Valerius Flaccus was aedile in 98 BC, but prosecuted (unsuccessfully) afterwards by Decianus. Flaccus was then praetor, then governor of Asia. He was a suffect consul in 86, taking command against Mithridates, passing a law cancelling three-quarters of all debts, and leaving for Asia. He was murdered in a mutiny by Gaius Flavius Fimbria. He was the brother of the Gaius Valerius Flaccus who was consul in 93 BC. L. Valerius Flaccus, praetor 63 BC The previous Flaccus' son was also (d. 54 BC). He served in Asia under his father, but fled to his uncle Gaius, who was in Gaul. He later served as military tribune in Cilicia, quaestor in Hispania under Piso, a legate of Metellus in Crete. As urban praetor he was with Cicero in the Conspiracy of Catiline, and then governor in Asia. In 59 Cicero defended him in a speech. Flaccus was then a legate of a later Piso, in Macedonia.

An appeal to advantage can also be a request from someone in a position of power to someone who is in a socially subordinate position; the request is specifically for the subordinate to perform an act contrary to the subordinate's wishes, such that the subordinate is forced to commit the act in order to satisfy a more significant need. The appeal is specifically most expedient or advantageous to the person in power, but is also presented as forwarding the subordinate's interests in some significant way.

Completed in 2006, it is part of the series of four sculptures within the Panopticons arts and regeneration project created by the East Lancashire Environmental Arts Network (ELEAN). The project was set up to erect a series of 21st-century landmarks, or Panopticons (structures providing a comprehensive view), across East Lancashire as symbols of the renaissance of the area. Designed by architects Mike Tonkin and Anna Liu of Tonkin Liu, the Singing Ringing Tree is a tall construction comprising pipes of galvanised steel which harness the energy of the wind to produce a slightly discordant and penetrating choral sound covering a range of several octaves. Some of the pipes are primarily structural and visual elements, while others have been cut across their width enabling the sound. The harmonic and singing qualities of the tree were produced by tuning the pipes according to their length by adding holes to the underside of each. In 2007, the sculpture won (along with 13 other candidates) the National Award of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) for architectural excellence. In March 2017, a second Singing Ringing Tree was set on the outskirts of Austin, Texas in the United States in the rural area of a small town called Manor.

These were originally rejected but on 6 October 2011 it was confirmed that the BBC plan to replace BBC HD with a single version of BBC Two HD in 2013. BBC Two HD replaced BBC HD on 26 March 2013. Meanwhile, BBC One HD received nations variations for Northern Ireland on 24 October 2012, Scotland on 14 January 2013 and Wales on 29 January 2013. For the duration of the 2012 Summer Olympics, the BBC operated 24 high-definition channels dedicated to the Olympics on Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media, as well as one channel on Freeview. On 13 June 2013, the BBC temporarily launched a high-definition red button stream on the Freesat, Freeview and Virgin Media EPGs. A commercial agreement for carriage on Sky wasn't reached and the channel was removed from satellite completely on 18 June, with the BBC claiming that it was for \\"technical reasons\\". The channel returned to satellite on 24 June after technical work was carried out on Sky's adaptation hub. On 16 July 2013, the BBC announced they would be launching five new HD channels in early 2014. The proposed channels consist of HD simulcasts of BBC Three, BBC Four, CBBC, CBeebies and BBC News. The channels will be broadcast on digital terrestrial television and satellite, as well as being offered to cable and IPTV operators. ITV The ITV network started broadcasting a trial service on Telewest's digital cable television platform as well as on the digital terrestrial television trial in London during the 2006 Football World Cup. The service ceased after this period, but a new HD service began to be made available with the launch of Freesat, on 7 June 2008, where selected programmes were offered in HD format, and accessed by the red button on Freesat receivers. ITV plc intended to spend ¬£10m during 2008 on supporting ITV HD. This occasional feed was intended for Freesat viewers and was not listed in the Sky EPG. However, ITV HD could be tuned in manually on Sky HD boxes via the \\"other channels\\" section from the \\"services\\" menu. On 12 March 2010 ITV plc announced its intention to launch a full-time ITV1 HD service, available on Freeview, Freesat, Virgin Media, and Sky.http://corporate.sky.com/investors/press_releases/2010/HD_channel_milestone The service launched on 2 April at 06:00.

All three channels are only available as part of Sky and Virgin Media's subscription packages. ITV Encore HD later followed, although it is only available on Sky's subscription package. Channel 4 Channel 4 launched its HD service on digital satellite in December 2007. The channel was encrypted on satellite, available with a free- to-view viewing card but as of April 2011 it is available free-to-air on Freesat. The channel is also available on Freeview and Virgin Media. On 14 December 2009, Channel 4 launched a second HD channel to Sky customers, E4 HD. The channel is a simulcast of E4, with selected programming in HD. Unlike its standard definition counterpart, E4 HD is a subscription channel, part of Sky's HD pack. Virgin Media subsequently also announced that it was to carry E4 HD, as well as a further new HD channel, Film4 HD, which would be available exclusively on cable at launch.http://pressoffice.virginmedia.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=205406&p;=RssLanding&cat;=news&id;=1399781 For the duration of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Channel 4 operated three high-definition channels dedicated to the Paralympics on Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media, as well as one channel on Freeview. On 4 February 2013, More4 HD launched on Sky, with Film4 HD being added on 2 September. In July 2014, Channel 4 +1 HD and 4seven HD services became available on the Freeview HD platform. Channel 4's carriage agreements with Sky TV and Virgin Media mean that Film4 HD and E4 HD are exclusive to those providers for the immediate future. However they may appear on Freeview once those agreements lapse. On 20 February 2018 Freesat announced that Channel 4HD and On Demand service ALL4 will leave the platform.https://www.freesat.co.uk/news/all4-4hd-leave-freesat/ Channel 4 cite rising EPG costs. S4C HD and Channel 5 HD however are still broadcasting on Freesat, so they appear to be able to afford the EPG costs. Channel 4 HD, Channel 4+1 HD and 4 Seven HD continue to broadcast on Freeview and Freeview Play retains ALL4.http://www.seenit.co.uk/channel-4-pulls-hd-and- catch-up-app-from-freesat/ S4C S4C launched an HD service, S4C Clirlun, on 30 April 2010. The service was exclusive to Freeview in Wales and available instead of Channel 4 HD. However, it was announced on 11 July 2012 that, as part of cost-saving measures designed to deal with the impact of cuts to S4C's public funding, Clirlun would close at the end of the year. The channel closed at on 1 December 2012, allowing Channel 4 HD to begin broadcasting in Wales on Freeview from 2 December 2012. It was announced on 20 May 2016 that S4C would relaunch a high-definition service S4C HD on Freesat and Sky in Wales and across the UK from 7 June onwards. Channel 5 Channel 5 was awarded a licence for HD transmissions on Freeview from 2010, but due Channel 5 being unable to resolve certain key criteria, the capacity was handed back to the BBC. Five HD launched on Sky and Virgin Media platforms on 13 July 2010.Channel Five to go HD on BSkyB The channel is free-to-view on satellite. In 2011 Channel 5 HD was the sole applicant for a fifth high-definition channel slot on Freeview, with the aim of launching in spring or early summer 2012. On 15 December 2011, Channel 5 dropped its bid to take the fifth slot after being unable to resolve \\"issues of commercial importance\\". Channel 5 HD however began broadcasting in HD on both Freesat and Freeview, after the BBC removed BBC Three / BBC iii from all digital TV platforms apart from its on- line BBC i-player service.. UKTV UKTV owns six HD channels, under the names of Eden HD, Good Food HD, Dave HD, W HD, Alibi HD and Gold HD. The channels broadcast on Sky and Virgin Media. Sky UK Sky began HD transmissions of several channels in May 2006. Platforms=TerrestrialFreeview= In March 2009, the Digital TV Group published the technical specification for high definition services on digital terrestrial television (DTT), contributing to the launch of three HD channels on the Freeview platform in early 2010. The technical launch of Freeview HD took place on 3 December 2009, when the service began broadcasting on UHF channel 54 from the Winter Hill transmitting station in Chorley, Lancashire, and on UHF channel 31 from the Crystal Palace transmitting station in Bromley, Greater London. These broadcasts form the Freeview HD service which requires new reception equipment, available since the consumer launch in early 2010. The service was rolled out on a region by region basis across the UK in accordance with the digital switchover programme. An advanced retrofit programme has been introduced to bring Freeview HD coverage to major cities such as London and Birmingham before they switch to digital television. The broadcasts make use of a single multiplex currently allowing four channels, BBC One HD, BBC Two HD, ITV HD/STV HD/UTV HD and Channel 4 HD. A fifth slot is available, with Channel 5 withdrawing from the opportunity to broadcast on it on two separate occasions, it has however been temporarily used by both the BBC and Channel 4. Between 22 and 23 March 2011, an encoder software change allowed the Freeview version of BBC HD to automatically detect progressive material and change encoding mode appropriately, meaning the channel could switch to 1080p25. This was extended to all of the other Freeview HD channels in October 2011. In November 2012, Ofcom backed a proposal from Arqiva, the BBC and Channel 4 to introduce two temporary multiplexes in the 600 MHz spectrum. The proposal would allow for up to ten HD channels, encouraging the take-up of Freeview HD equipment. On 6 February 2013, Ofcom agreed to the proposals, offering multiplexe licenses to operate until 2026, with a minimum term running until 31 December 2018. Channel 4+1HD and 4Seven HD are also available on Freeview. SatelliteSkySubscription Sky has been carrying HD channels since May 2006. it has over sixty HD channels, a mix of basic and premium subscription, free-to-air and free-to-view services.

Channel 5 HD was available free-to-view on the service until October 2013, when the channel became subscription only. =Freesat= Freesat launched on 6 May 2008. It provides a subscription-free alternative to Sky and includes support for HD with a selection of HD channels available via a Freesat HD box. Freesat is a not-for-profit company formed by the BBC and ITV, marketing itself as being completely free from subscription charges or contracts, although viewers of course are still obliged to pay the television licence, and must purchase a suitable satellite receiver and have a satellite dish installed (if they do not already have one) to receive the service.

Channel 4 HD was pulled from Freesat on 22 February 2018 along with its ALL4 on demand service. These are still available on Freeview however. CableVirgin Media= Virgin TV's V+ cable service was the first HD service in the UK when it was launched by Telewest as the TVDrive on 1 December 2005. From launch it carried two channels but after the completion of ITV's HD trial, it only carried the BBC HD channel, alongside on demand content from several broadcasters. However, from 2009 the number of HD channels steadily increased, which stands at over thirty HD channels. On 16 March 2010, Virgin announced that from 22 March they would offer a V HD Box, with no additional monthly subscription fee.

His widely translated book Why Men Rebel (1970)Why Men Rebel, Princeton University Press, 1970; revised edition Paradigm Publishers, 2010 emphasized the importance of social psychological factors (relative deprivation) and ideology as root sources of political violence. He was Distinguished University Professor emeritus at the University of Maryland and consulted on projects he established there. He died in November 2017.http://www.start.umd.edu/news/memoriam-ted-robert-gurr Career Before joining the University of Maryland faculty in 1989 Gurr held academic positions at Princeton University (1965‚Äì69), Northwestern University (1970‚Äì83), where he was Payson S. Wild Professor and chair of the political science department (1977-80), and the University of Colorado at Boulder (1984‚Äì88). In 1968 Gurr was asked to join the staff of the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, established by President Lyndon B. Johnson after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. He teamed with historian Hugh Davis Graham to prepare the 1969 report Violence in America: Historical and Comparative Perspectives, which was widely publicized and published in many editions, the last of them in 1989, Violence in America, vol. 1, The History of Crime, and vol. 2, Protest, Rebellion, Reform.Violence in America: Vol 1, The History of Crime and Vol. 2, Protest, Rebellion, Reform, Sage, 1989 The Polity study, begun by Gurr in the late 1960s, profiles the democratic and autocratic traits of all regimes worldwide from 1800 to the present. The project is now directed by Dr. Monty G. Marshall of the Center for Systemic Peace, one of the two dozen Ph.D.'s whose doctoral work he has supervised. The Polity data is widely used by researchers and government agencies to track democratization and to assess the stability of contemporary regimes. The Minorities at Risk project, which he began in 1985, assesses the political status and activities of more than 300 ethnic and religious minorities world-wide. The MAR project, which is continued by a research team at the University of Maryland's Center for International Development and Conflict Management (CIDCM), provides data for his and others‚Äô analyses of the causes and management of ethnopolitical protest and rebellion, most recently in Peoples versus States: Minorities at Risk in the New CenturyPeoples versus States: Minorities at Risk in the New Century (US Institute of Peace Press, 2000) and Ethnic Conflict in World Politics, coauthored with Barbara Harff.Ethnic Conflict in World Politics, with Barbara Harff (2003) In 1994-95 Gurr helped establish the State Failure Task Force (now the Political Instability Task Force) at the request of Vice President Gore's office, to provide global risk assessments of impending intrastate conflicts.

However, his business ethics were precarious and his commercial affairs frequently chaotic. He became much addicted to litigation. Early life Wilkinson was born in Washington, then in County Durham. He was the fifth child of John Wilkinson and his wife, Margaret Thompson. His mother died soon after his birth and his father in 1704, leaving him to be brought up by his elder brother John, a wool merchant. He seems to have received some basic education before being apprenticed a foundryman, probably at the nearby Swalwell works. There, he established himself as a highly skilled iron-worker, able to demand high wages.Harris (2006) Cumberland and Lancashire Some time between 1721 and 1723, Wilkinson moved to Workington where he worked at the Little Clifton furnace which probably produced cast iron by smelting with coke. Here Wilkinson operated as a specialist subcontractor to the furnace. In 1735 he moved to Backbarrow furnace, which smelted with charcoal,P. Riden, A gazetteer of the charcoal-fired blast furnaces in Great Britain (2nd Edition, Merton Priory Press, Cardiff 1993), 107-8 114. buying iron from the firm and selling his own produce. He was an influence on John Wilkinson his son. In 1738 he patented a cast box smoothing-iron though it is suspected that he already knew that it was invalid owing to prior art. He went into production in partnership with his brother John but indulged in \\"creative accounting\\" to cheat his brother of the profits and the partnership folded. By now, Isaac was living in Cartmel, enjoying several business interests, including the Lowwood iron company. However, the Lowwood project ended in litigation when the weakness of his patent emerged and he accused the enterprise of poaching workers from his other enterprises. Wales Bersham Ironworks In 1753, Wilkinson moved south to Bersham, near Wrexham in Wales. There he operated a furnace, the Bersham Ironworks, with his son John, Edward Blakeway and others. Wilkinson developed the business while maintaining his own subcontracted casting business. Another patent in 1757 was for a blowing-engine for blast furnaces, using columns of water similar to the trempe system, though it is uncertain how effective it was. Blakeway was declared bankrupt in 1759, his shares passing to Mary Lee who married John Wilkinson in 1763. This gave the Wilkinsons control of Bersham and the business flourished. Isaac patented a novel moulding process in 1758. Isaac's personal subcontract business was a source of continued tensions. Litigation against his partners, including his son, had started as early as 1762, being exacerbated by the slump in Bersham's business following the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763 when demand for armaments dried up. Isaac moved to Bristol and John ended up as the owner of the Bersham works. Later life Isaac became a foundryman in Bristol with involvement in the south Wales Dowlais Ironworks and Cyfarthfa Ironworks, and starting the Plymouth Ironworks with John Guest. Disputes with coal suppliers at Cyfarthfa led to further legal action but Isaac's finances were becoming precarious. From the 1770s he was involved in further litigation, including, again, against his son John. He died in London, and was buried at St Giles in the fields, Holborn, on 8 Feb 1784.London Metropolitan Archives Private life Wilkinson was Presbyterian in religion. In 1727 he married Mary Johnson (died 1786) and they had seven children including: *John Wilkinson (1728‚Äì1808); *Mary Wilkinson (1743‚Äì1796) who married Joseph Priestley; and *William Wilkinson (1744‚Äì1808).

Australian author and novelist Rachael Treasure resides in the area. The settlement has a historic primary school, established 15 April 1901, which also serves as a community centre and focal point for the area. In 2008, facing the threat of closure with falling enrolments, the community rallied to increase the population of the area and save the school.Reporter: Simon Cullen, Levendale Future ABC Stateline Tasmania, Broadcast: 09/05/2008.

Accessed October 26, 2008 History=Aboriginal Occupation The first people to inhabit the Levendale area were the Portmairremener, a band of the Oyster Bay Tribe who lived mainly around the mouth of the Prosser River. Each winter various bands of the Oyster Bay Tribe congregated around the coastal areas of Great Oyster Bay to harvest shellfish and marine vegetables until the end of July, when swans and ducks arrived in the lagoons and riverine areas to lay their eggs and raise their young. In August the bands moved up the Little Swanport and Prosser Rivers to the Eastern Marshes to hunt birds, kangaroos and wallabies.Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania, Moulting Lagoon Game Reserve - Highlights, Cultural Values. Accessed October 27, 2008 As summer drew near the bands moved further west towards the Central Highlands, only to return to the coast as autumn approached. No doubt due to its prominence, the Aboriginals would have used Mt. Hobbs as a reference point in their annual migrations. In 1830, a large fire was kept burning on the summit of Brown Mountain as a point of direction for Governor Arthur's Black Line, that ill- fated attempt to drive the remaining Aborigines towards the Tasman Peninsula where they could be captured. This failure led Arthur in 1831 to appoint George Augustus Robinson to locate and bring in the remaining aboriginals. During October, Robinson camped at Hobbs Lagoon and passed over the head of Bluff River. European settlement Due to the nearly impenetrable nature of the bush, Europeans did not settle at Levendale until the second half of the nineteenth century. Indeed, so dense was this bush that the area was originally known as \\"The Scrub\\". The first known settler was Henry Buscombe who selected of land at Levendale in 1842, calling his property Cutting Grass Marsh. In 1845, Henry's brother James purchased a block alongside his brother's property at the Cutting Grass Marsh. Sometime between 1852 and 1868 a William Hodgson became the third person to take up land in the area when he purchased a Levenbanks. The assessment roll for 1858 shows John McConnon leasing near the Prosser River and in 1861 he was leasing from the Crown at Prosser River. By 1868 John and his son John William McConnon were leasing at Levenbanks and in 1870 John is recorded as owning with a hut on the land. Following the deaths of the Buscombe brothers (Henry 1844: James 1851) a William Brown leased the Buscombe's blocks in 1861. In 1873 Kele Balsley, a native of Denmark who had apparently jumped ship at the Saltworks near Little Swanport in 1865, purchased of land at Levendale where he built a family home. The 1880s witnessed a rapid increase in settlement. Settlers taking up land at this time were: Colin Patterson and Michael Powell (1883), the brothers Montgomery (1886), Harold Burrows (1887) and William Crawford who built a house at Levendale in 1897. By the end of the century over two hundred people lived at Levendale. The first task facing these early settlers was of course to carve out farms and homes from the dense bush ‚Äì a thankless and difficult job. At first this work was carried out by hand, the settlers ring barking trees and cutting the undergrowth with axes and slash hook, the ash from the annual summer burnings used as fertilizer to help in the growth of grass and clover for cattle. The introduction of horses and bullocks at least provided some relief from the hard task of settlement. The settlers' first homes were built from split timber with shingle roofs. As there was no running water, one of the main daily tasks was the carrying of water from nearby creeks, a responsibility often given to the youngest members of the family. As most homes had no bathroom, bathing was done by hip bather, the water heated in tins on open fires or wood stoves. Hurricane lamps and candles provided the only source of light. Of course the settlers of necessity had to be nearly self-sufficient in such a remote settlement. Straight-grained trees that split easily were used to provide palings and posts for buildings and fences; vegetable gardens were established, and each household produced its own milk, butter and eggs. Meat came from the farm's own livestock, and if that source of supply fell short then there was always the ever-present wallaby or rabbit to tide the family over. The preservation of food was always a problem, but salting down vegetables and the use of wet sand packs for butter in summer ensured a reliable supply of household necessities. The purchase of essential items such as flour, tea, sugar and salt meant a fairly arduous journey to either Oatlands or Sorell every three months. Whilst most of the young men worked on the farms, either their own or a neighbor's, many traveled around the district shearing sheep or working as farm hands for the wealthier farmers. Sawmilling also was an important part of the area's history. This industry also supplied local men and boys with employment. The earliest mills belonged to the Campbell, Barker and McConnon families. These were steam engine operated and supplied timber for many of the local homes and buildings. The only sawmill still operating today is run by Alf and Barry McConnon. It was always possible to make a few shillings on the side after the government introduced a bounty scheme for trapping and killing Tasmanian tigers (thylacines) in 1888, with a number of claims being made upon the government by settlers in the Levendale area. Young women not employed at home usually found work as housemaids or a shop assistants until they married and had their own families; families that not uncommonly ran to thirteen or more children. The continued growth of Levendale towards the end of the 1890s led to local demands for improved services to cater for the growing needs of the community. High on the list of priorities was a local school. Levendale Primary School Following strong representations from the Reverend T. W. Pitt, Church of England Minister at Spring Bay and the Hon. W. W. Perkins. M.L.C. the government agreed to build a school at Levendale. The decision to build the school seems also to have inspired the community to look for an appropriate name for the town, after all \\"The Scrub\\" State School must have had a peculiar ring to it, one that doubtless inspired little confidence. Consequently, the opening of the school on 15 April 1901 provided the local community with the chance to hold a public meeting to decide upon a new name for the area. That meeting agreed upon the name Levendale, the first part of which was derived from the name of one of the oldest farms in the district, Levenbanks, belonging to Mr. V Hodgson, and later Thomas McConnon. And so the school opened with Mr. W. Duthie appointed first teacher in charge and with William Crawford and Frank McConnon registered as the first of what would eventually prove to be over 1000 students who would pass through the doors. As with most small country towns the new school offered not only a chance for and educations for the local children but a focal point for the whole community, many of the local events being organized around the school. In 2007 Levendale Primary School is still the focal point for the whole community, boasting a student population at 23, community library, enthusiastic history group, zero to four learning program, playgroup, prekindergarten and many other activities. With the school under threat of closure in 2008 due to low student numbers author and local resident Rachael Treasure proposed to the community that vacant farmhouses be put up for rent of $1 per week to attract more families to the area. The offer attracted interest from around Australia, New Zealand and as far afield as Japan and Singapore.Damien Brown and AAP, Global rush for Tasmania's $1 house crashes website, July 29, 2008.

Originally known as Punjab Medical College Football Club for its association with Punjab Medical College, the name was changed to current after the club had a 50% share takeover by Zenith Sports in July 2008 before the start of the 2008-09 Pakistan Premier League season. Old PMC FC Logo. History The club was founded in Faisalabad as an independent team. They teamed up with Punjab Medical College, making use of their home stadium and becoming Punjab Medical College Football Club or PMC F.C. for short. They were largely anonymous in Pakistan club football until they won promotion from the Pakistan Football Federation League to Pakistan Premier League in 2007. However, they found life difficult in the Pakistan Premier League in which they suffered heavy defeats. In their first 10 games they only picked up one point, but a 2-0 home win against the equally struggling Wohaib FC gave the team its first win the PPL. The team still struggled until the second half of the season where they improved to the point they closed in on 13th placed Pakistan Railways and safety. On the final fixture of the season, they needed to win against Pakistan Navy, having a game in hand over Railwaymen. PMC FC beat Navy 2-1 at home, allowing them to stay in the PPL for another season. Between the end of the 2007-08 season and the start of the 2008 season saw great change at the club. A group called Zenith Sports with CEO Malik Riaz Hai Naveed took a 50% stake in the club. Zenith Sports at earlier planned to start a club in the Geo Super league, but with the league cancelled, they decided to invest in a PPL club instead. The owners and supporter of the group are seen at the FootballPakistan.com forum, where they discuss football, and formulate ways to help the sport in Pakistan. It was here were initial ideas to run a football club started. They renamed the club PMC Club Athletico Faisalabad, a name heavily influenced by Spanish football. The new name and background changes failed to improve the club's fortunes. After a good start, Athletico faltered and quickly found themselves hovering around the relegation zone.

It was written by Tom Verlaine. In the United Kingdom, \\"Marquee Moon\\" was released as a single on April 1, 1977. Its first pressing was as a 12\\" single only, limited to 25,000 copies, with the song in stereo on one side and in mono on the other side. Subsequent pressings of the single were as a 7\\" single, with the track split into two over the A-side and B-side.  Composition  Each of the song's three verses begins with a double-stopped guitar intro before Billy Ficca's drums come in, and after the second chorus Richard Lloyd plays a brief guitar solo. After the third chorus, there is a longer solo by Tom Verlaine, based on a jazz-like mixolydian scale, that lasts for the entire second half of the song. On the original vinyl edition of the album, the song faded out just short of ten minutes, but the CD reissues have included the full 10:40 of the take. In concert, the band has sometimes extended the song to as long as fifteen minutes.  Release and reception  Despite its length, which would typically have been too long for most popular music radio formats, the song was released as a single in the U.K. and was a minor success, reaching number 30 on the UK Singles Chart. Because of its length, the song had to be divided between the two sides of a 7\\" record: \\"Marquee Moon\\" (Part I) (3:13) b/w \\"Marquee Moon\\" (Part II) (6:45).

His main achievement were negotiations concerning ownership of Britain's interests in what is now Honduras and Nicaragua. Career Ouseley was born in London to the orientalist Sir William Ouseley and his wife Julia. He was attach√© in Washington D.C. from 1825 to 1832, when he had his first book published.Historical Autographs accessed 17 September 2007 The country of Argentina was effectively created in 1826, and he was amongst a group of Britons who assisted the new country gaining an advantage for Britain, negotiating contracts for expertise such as railways.The Forgotten Colony, by Andrew Graham Yooll, published by Hutchison, 1981 Ouseley later served in Rio de Janeiro in 1832 as a consul where he rose to the rank of minister. Not soon after that he was posted to Buenos Aires where he remained until 1850. His book concerning the slave trade which he published in 1850 is still (2007) in print. Ouseley was very well connected, having a Governor as a father-in-law, a sister-in-law who was also a judge in New York and another sister who had received a marriage proposal from US President James Buchanan.Private and confidential: Letter from British Ministers in Washington to the Foreign Secretaries in London 1844‚Äì67 by James J. Barnes, Patience P. Barnes, Published 1993 Susquehanna University Press He had but one blot on his record, having been recalled from Rio de Janeiro, although his superior was generous enough to admit that the argument that caused the recall was in hindsight found to be in Ouseley's favour. In the UK, both his father and his uncle, Sir Gore Ouseley, were well-connected diplomats and gentleman scholars. Special mission In October 1858 he was sent on a special mission to San Jos√© in Costa Rica as a Special Envoy on the British warship Valorous; William Synge served as secretary to the mission. Ouseley's objective was to resolve Britain's interests in Central America, particularly the Bay Islands off Honduras, the Mosquito Coast and Greytown (both now in Nicaragua). His diplomatic activity in Costa Rica was favored by the fact that he was a relative of Sophia Joy, the British second wife of President Jose Maria Montealegre (1859-1863). In 1859, he negotiated a treaty concerning the British interests with Nicaragua and with Costa Rica which involved the President of Nicaragua personally. In early November, Ouseley required a change for his health and he announced his return to Britain before the treaty was signed.The New York , 2 November 1859 Within two weeks he had to return as his only son, William Charles Ouseley, had died at the age of 27 in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay due to an opium overdose.The New York Times, 15 November 1859 Art and literature thumb Ouseley's paintings are still a marketable commodity in 2007.William Gore Ouseley painting Accessed September 2007 Ouseley was also an early commentator on the legends which grew up around the historical figure Dick Whittington. Ouseley's Travels (1819) was among the first to publish that a cognate cat tale was to be found in the Persian manuscript of the Tarik al- Wasaf. The story is related thus: > In the tenth century, one Keis, the son of a poor widow in S√≠raf, embarked > for India, with his sole property, a cat, his only property. There he > fortunately arrived at a time when the palace was so infested by mice or > rats, that they invaded the king's food, and persons were employed to drive > them from the royal banquet. Keis produced his cat; the noxious animals soon > disappeared, and magnificent rewards were bestowed on the adventurer of > S√≠raf, who returned to that city, and afterwards, with his mother and > brothers, settled on the island, which from him has been denominated Keis, > or according to the Persians, Keish. A little earlier, James Morier Second Journey (1818) also published the connection between Whittington's cat and the same tale, having heard the story told by the ambassador (i.e. Ouseley's uncle, Sir Gore). Personal life Whilst he was in America, he married Marcia Van Ness (d. 1881) in 1827, the 20-year-old daughter of the Governor of Vermont, Cornelius P. Van Ness (1782‚Äì1852).Ouseley family tree accessed September 2007 *William Charles Ouseley (d. 1859), died aged 27 in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay due to an opium overdose.

Currently part of the 5th Brigade, attached to the 2nd Division, the unit currently consists of a headquarters, signals platoon and three rifle companies spread out across a number of depots throughout the state of New South Wales. The unit was formed in 1987, following a reorganisation of the Australian Army Reserve which saw the amalgamation of a number of Reserve units across Australia. Through the 2nd Battalion and the 17th Battalion, the unit can trace its lineage back to 1860 and today it carries battle honours from both of these units, as well as the units of the Second Australian Imperial Force which fought during World War II. History The 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment was formed on 5 December 1987 when the 2nd and 17th Battalions were amalgamated during a ceremony held at Newcastle, New South Wales.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 332‚Äì333. This was part of a re-organisation of the Royal New South Wales Regiment that took place at the time, which saw two battalions in each brigade linked in order to respond to the declining size of a number of units.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 332.Shaw 2010 pp. 10‚Äì11. Upon formation, the battalion was assigned to the 8th Brigade, and allocated a recruitment area that stretched from the centre of Sydney to the New South Wales Central Coast. At this time also, the battalion adopted the battle honours and traditions of its predecessor units, perpetuating a lineage that can be traced as far back as 1860, and includes active service in the Mahdist War, the Boer War, World War I and World War II. In 1988, the newly formed battalion marched through the municipality of Ku-ring-gai, after it was granted the Freedom of Entry to the town.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 333. In 1990, 2/17 RNSWR was called upon to provide disaster relief in the wake of Newcastle earthquake and the Nyngan floods. Following this, the battalion was relocated to Silverwater, New South Wales while Suakin Depot was being refurbished. The battalion did not return until 13 April 1996, when they once again marched through Ku-ring-gai and returned to Suakin, taking up residence along with the 7th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery. In July 1994, as a result of a re-organisation of the 2nd Division, two of the battalion's rifle companies‚Äîthose based at Orange and Bathurst‚Äîwere transferred to the 1st/19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. At the same time, the battalion gained a company that was based at Arncliffe from the 4th/3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. In 1997, as a result of a re-organisation of the Ready Reserve Scheme, the battalion gained a company (designated 'D' Company) from the 6th Brigade, although in 2000 this company was relocated to Blacktown. The previous year, 'B' Company was moved to Erina. Throughout the late 1990s, 2/17 RNSWR took part in a number of large-scale exercises. These included Kangaroo '95, which was a multinational exercise that was undertaken in northern Australia. Later, in 1997, the battalion took part in a brigade-level exercise at Broken Hill along with units from the South Australian-based 9th Brigade, while a company was sent to the Battle Wing at Canungra, Queensland. The unit has contributed individuals, sections or platoons to operations including Rifle Company Butterworth, Solomon Islands, East Timor, Transit Security Element, Task Group Taji and Task Group Afghanistan. The battalion is currently part of the 5th Brigade. In 2020, Soldiers from across the Battalion were called-out/for to deploy on OP Bushfire Assist. Members of 2/17 RNSWR have also subsequently been deployed on OP COVID-19 Assist.

He was replaced by Swedish singer Mikael Rickfors. In the opinion of contemporary and retrospective critics, this album moved the band further away from the original vocal harmony style of Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks and Graham Nash. The album only features two songwriting contributions from band members: one song was co-written by Tony Hicks, who had been a co-writer on a significant proportion of the band's material since their second album; and another was written by new member Rickfors. Previous albums, with the exception of Hollies Sing Dylan and the band's debut album, had much more original material. The US Epic Records version of the album, which reached number 84 on the Billboard 200, omitted the track \\"Lizzy and the Rainman\\", and has a slightly altered side one track order. The album failed to chart in the UK. The cover of Romany is a rendering of the summer location depicted on Distant Light as a winter scene. As the album was nearing release the members of the group were getting nervous and made at least three changes in the album, announced a single before retracting it, which delayed the album for three months. Due to the success of the previous album and its smash hit single, the LP initially sold very well in the US. Upon its release, Romany sold six times more copies in the first week in the US than any previous Hollies album had sold in a year. It also received more US FM airplay than the band had ever got in their previous nine years. Circus Magazine, May 1973. - \\"Romany - The Hollies Hop Over Disaster\\" by Janis Schacht.

It was first published in 1957, and in 1958 was published in the US as Dancing Shoes, a title which has also been used in more recent UK editions.Wintle's Wonders at Fantastic Fiction A number of Streatfeild's children's novels have undergone similar retitling, linking them to her most successful book, Ballet Shoes.The Shoes Books Wintle's Wonders draws on the author's own acting experience, and revisits the type of theatrical establishment seen in her adult novels The Whicharts and It Pays to be Good.Wintle's Wonders page on Noel Streatfeild fansite  Plot summary  As the book begins, Rachel Lennox and her adopted sister Hilary are living with Rachel's mother. Rachel's father, George Lennox, was a budding film star, but died just as his career was taking off, when the children were seven. As a result, the family is not well off; they must take in boarders to make ends meet. Hilary's mother was a dancer, and so Rachel and her mother are determined that Hilary will also become a ballerina. Hilary does have a talent for ballet, but is not at all interested in it. Their mother dies when the girls are ten, just before Hilary's audition for the Royal Ballet School, and the girls go to live with their Uncle Tom (their father's brother), his wife Cora Wintle, and their daughter, Dulcie. Aunt Cora runs a dancing school to teach girls how to perform in troupes for pantomimes, musicals and reviews; the troupes are referred to as \\"Mrs Wintle's Little Wonders\\". Dulcie, who is almost a year older than Rachel and Hilary, is very attractive and a talented dancer, but also very spoiled by her mother. Mrs Wintle originally intends to take only Rachel, as she is a blood relative, but she decides to keep Hilary also, when she realises how talented a dancer Hilary is. Rachel is horrified by the type of dancing taught at Mrs Wintle's school, which includes tap, musical comedy, and acrobatics, and remains determined that Hilary will continue with her ballet. Rachel must also train as a Little Wonder, and though she works hard, she has no talent for the dancing required of the \\"Wonders\\". However she does excel in ordinary lessons, and at their additional elocution and acting lessons, which puts her in competition with her cousin Dulcie without it coming to light for most of the book. Mrs Storm, their tutor, decides to teach Rachel extra elocution, because it makes her happy. Hilary continues dancing and throughout the book enjoys acrobatics in particular. Although Rachel bribes her with money to finish ballet, which seems to work Hilary also continues to excel at acrobatics. This continually makes Rachel upset. Rachel discovers that when she is fifteen, she may be allowed to train for something else; this excites her, and she vows to send Hilary to the Royal Ballet School as soon as she can. In the meantime she works hard in her own dancing, but she is still disliked by her aunt as she is not enthusiastic and even her best efforts do not make her, though competent, a good dancer. Dulcie, meanwhile, gains a license to work as soon as she is twelve and immediately stars in a continuous line of pantomime, television and musicals. This gives her an air of unbearable conceit, and she goes through a phase of thinking nobody can dance, act or sing better than she can. Rachel soon follows, and is very much the opposite; she hates being onstage and is happy to be an understudy, and detests her uncomfortable Wonder uniform. Hilary gains a job as Dulcie's understudy, and it is clear that she rivals Dulcie as both an actress and dancer and outshines her completely in comedic value. This begins to scare Dulcie, who wonders if her position as a star is as stable as she believed. However, Hilary is unlike Dulcie in that although she loves dancing, she is lazy and dislikes putting great effort into anything. Contributing to Dulcie's worries, for a while she is out of work, having previously been in high demand in the showbusiness world. However, an offer for a film soon comes up, and Dulcie is immediately put forward for the role; she desperately wants a film contract as hit would secure her a reputation as a star of stage and screen while still a child. Mrs Wintle is sure that her daughter will get it, saying that she sees her name in big electric lights. Dulcie goes for her film test, but clearly is not what the director is looking for. He is at a loss, as Dulcie is a pretty child and a talented actress, but cannot feel a role, as is required for the film. As it happens, Rachel has come to the film test, having had nothing better to do, and is reading when the director sees her and realising that she has the face he has been searching for, and her talent for acting, nurtured by Mrs Storm, comes to light: Rachel walks out with a film contract, and Dulcie with nothing, leaving Mrs Wintle furious with Mrs Storm for giving Rachel acting lessons behind her back; however she can do nothing. As a final attempt, Rachel considers spending the money she will make on sending Hilary to the Royal Ballet school straight away instead of when she turns fifteen, as Hilary tells her that she won't go near the place, and gently adds that it would be pointless to make her do something that does not inspire her at all, Rachel gives up on Hilary as she looks forward to her own, glittering future.  Main characters  Rachel Lennox is the daughter of actor George Lennox and his wife. A serious-minded child, she tries to take responsibility for herself and her adopted sister Hilary after they are orphaned. Hilary Lennox is Rachel's adopted sister; the two are very close. Though Rachel wants Hilary to become a ballerina like Hilary's birth mother, Hilary prefers tap dance, acrobatics, and musical comedy.  The Wintles  Cora Wintle is Rachel and Hilary's aunt, a former dancer who now runs a dance academy. Tom Lennox is Cora's husband, a painter who does not take much interest in dance. He becomes Rachel's friend and protector. Dulcie Wintle is Cora and Tom's daughter, a talented but proud and snobbish dancer. She is jealous of Hilary, and detests Rachel.  People in school  Mrs Purser, known as Pursie, is the costumer and housekeeper at Mrs Wintle's school. Mrs Storm is Dulcie, Rachel, and Hilary's schoolteacher, who introduces Rachel to elocution and acting. Pat and Ena are dance teachers at Mrs Wintle's school. Yolanda and Wanda are chefs at Mrs Wintle's school.

Biography Tessitori was born in the north-eastern Italian town of Udine on 13 December 1887, to Guido Tessitori, a worker at the Foundling Hospital, and Luigia Rosa Venier Romano. He studied at the Liceo Classico Jacopo Stellini before going on to university. He studied at the University of Florence, obtaining his degree in the humanities in 1910. He is said to have been a quiet student, and when he took up the study of Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit, his classmates gave him a nickname Indian Louis. Having developed an abiding interest in north Indian vernacular languages, Tessitori tried hard to obtain an appointment in Rajasthan. He applied in 1913 to the India Office; realising that there was no guarantee of a job offer, he also approached Indian princes who might employ him for linguistic work. Around this time, he established contact with a Jain teacher, Vijaya Dharma Suri (1868-1923) with whom he was to have a close personal and professional relationship. Suri was known for his deep knowledge of Jain literature, and was instrumental in the retrieval and preservation of many of its works. Tessitori appealed to him for criticism of his exegeses on Jain literature and practises. Suri offered him a position at a Jain school in Rajasthan, but while negotiating the delicate position of a Christian living in a Jain community, Tessitori received approval for his application from the India Office, and made preparations to head to India in 1914. In India, Tessitori involved himself with both its Linguistic Survey and the Archaeological Survey, and made discoveries of fundamental importance to Indology. In 1919, he received news that his mother was seriously ill, and he left for Italy on 17 April. By the time he arrived, she was dead. He stayed in Italy for several months before returning to India in November. Unfortunately, he apparently contracted Spanish influenza on board his ship, and fell seriously ill. He died on 22 November 1919 in Bikaner. Career=Thesis and Early Work Between 1846 and 1870, twelve volumes of the Bengali or Gauda version of Valmiki's Ramayana were published in Italy by Gaspare Gorresio, which became an important reference for Italian Indologists. Tessitori's thesis was based on this work, and involved an analysis of the connections between it and Tulsidas's version, written in Avadhi nearly a thousand years later. He showed that Tulsidas had borrowed the main story from Valmiki, expanding or reducing the particulars, but retelling them in a poetic form that was independent of the original, and hence could be considered a new work. It was painstaking research involving a verse-by-verse comparison of the two versions, and showing that Tulsidas had followed different versions of the Ramayana that were extant in India at the time. His thesis was published under the supervision of Paolo Emilio Pavolini in 1911. Linguistic Survey of India The Asiatic Society of Bengal invited Tessitori to join its Linguistic Survey of India. He was tasked by Sir George Grierson to lead the Bardic and Historical Survey of Rajputana. He arrived in 1914 and stayed in Rajputana for five years. He translated and commented upon the medieval chronicles and poems of Rajasthan, several of which he had earlier studied at Florence's national library. He studied the grammar of old Rajasthani along the same comparative lines as he had with his thesis, and laid the foundations of the history of the development of modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars. Tessitori explored the poetic compositions in the Dingala and Pingala dialects, and genealogical narratives. He managed to catalogue the private bardic libraries and several princely state libraries, despite some bureaucratic opposition. In 1915, invited by the Maharaja of Bikaner, Tessitori arrived in that state and began lexicographic and grammatical studies in the regional literature. He was able to show that the dialect hitherto called Old Gujarati should more properly be called Old Western Rajasthani. He was also much taken with the beauty of Rajasthani dialects, and critically edited several exemplars of their literatures, such as the Veli Krishna Rukmani Ri of Rathor Prithviraja, and Chanda Rao Jetsingh Ro of Vithu Suja. Archaeology Along with his linguistic work, Tessitori ranged across Jodhpur and Bikaner in search of memorial pillars, sculptures, coins, and archaeological sites on behalf of Sir John Marshall of the Archaeological Survey of India. Tessitori retrieved Gupta terracottas from mounds in Rangamahal and other locations, as well as two colossal marble images of the goddess Saraswati near Ganganagar. He found Kushan-period terracottas at Dulamani, also in Ganganagar. He also decoded and published the texts of epigraphs on stone (Goverdhan) pillars and tablets in the Jodhpur-Bikaner region. He noted the proto-historic ruins in the Bikaner- Ganganagar region, correctly pointing out that these predated Mauryan culture. This finding enabled the later discovery and excavation of the Indus Valley Civilization site of Kalibangan. He communicated the discovery of three objects from Kalibangan to Sir George Grierson during his brief stay in Italy in 1919. > Two of them - the first one is a seal - bear an inscription in characters > which I am unable to identify. I suspect it is an extremely interesting > find: the mound itself on which the objects were discovered, is very > interesting. I believe it is prehistorical or, at least, non-Aryan. Perhaps > the inscriptions refer to a foreign race? Grierson suggested he show them to John Marshall upon his return to India. This he was unable to do as he died when he got back to Bikaner. The knowledge of the seals was buried with him, and was recovered only when Hazarimal Banthia, a Kanpur businessman, brought back copies of his correspondence from Italy.

The act renamed the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). It also created the Northern Ireland Policing Board and District Police Partnerships. The act was designed to gain cross-community support for law enforcement in Northern Ireland with several initiatives included in the act, including a change of oath of office and a 50:50 recruitment policy for Protestants and Roman Catholics. The Bill for this Act received its first reading in the House of Commons on 16 May 2000.Hansard (House of Commons). Vol 350. Col 161.  Background  Royal Ulster Constabulary badge The Royal Ulster Constabulary had been responsible for law enforcement in Northern Ireland since being split from the all-Ireland Royal Irish Constabulary before the partition of Ireland. During The Troubles, they had been accused by nationalists of having a unionist bias against the nationalist minority. Despite this, they had a reputation as an efficient anti-terrorism police force and were collectively awarded the George Cross by Queen Elizabeth II. Following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 to end hostilities in Northern Ireland, a report was set up led by the former Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten to look into giving policing in Northern Ireland cross-community consent. The majority of the report from the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland (known as the Patten Report) suggested substituting the Royal Ulster Constabulary for a more representative force with a change of name and reduction of numbers. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act was intended to fulfill this report though it was amended when going through Parliament.  Name of the force  The first clause of the act covered the name of the police force. The Patten Report originally suggested naming the force the \\"Northern Ireland Police Service\\". The government of the United Kingdom adapted the proposal and put forward for the force to be named \\"Police Service of Northern Ireland\\" instead as they disliked the acronymn of NIPS. Unionists wanted to retain the royal title in the name of the new police force, with the Ulster Unionist Party leader and First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble citing not many British police forces had a royal title and felt that the heritage of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was being ignored. During the debate on the bill, MPs cited that there were several organisations in the Republic of Ireland, such as the Royal Irish Yacht Club and the Royal Irish Academy, that retained a royal title without comment. In the House of Lords, the former leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, Lord Fitt also requested that the Royal Ulster Constabulary retain its name. Following pressure from the Conservative Party, the government compromised and the Police (Northern Ireland) Act decreed the official name of the force to be the \\"Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the Royal Ulster Constabulary)\\". The act also provided for the Royal Ulster Constabulary George Cross Foundation to be established for \\"marking the sacrifices and honouring the achievements of the Royal Ulster Constabulary\\".  Police authority  A new Northern Ireland Policing Board would be created under the act to replace the Police Authority of Northern Ireland. The Patten Report suggested having political representation on the board with local divisions corresponding to Northern Irish district councils being appointed with full administrative oversight. The Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams wanted the Patten Report's suggestions to be fully implemented. However following unionist concerns that the proposed districts would give members of the IRA too much influence over the police, the proposals were watered down to allow Chief Constables to challenge decisions made by the board. Sinn F√©in initially refused to take their seats on the Policing Board as a result. They would eventually do so in 2007.  Recruitment  The act included a provision regarding recruitment for new police officers. It stated that the force's size should be reduced by 4,500 officers over ten years. It was felt that the force was too large for a peacetime service. A generous severance scheme was set up to compensate any officers who left the police as a result. At the time of the act's passage, the Royal Ulster Constabulary had a 9:1 ratio of Protestant to Roman Catholic officers. The act provided that recruitment would be done on a 50:50 basis to gradually lead towards a police force that was 50 per cent Protestant and 50 per cent Catholic. This proposal in the Patten Report was made in the hope that the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) would repeal Rule 21 which prohibited members of British police forces from playing Gaelic games. The GAA eventually did this in 2001. The act also followed on from a policy change that stated constables would no longer have to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen in 1997. In 2011, the British government voted to repeal the 50:50 recruitment requirement when Catholic membership numbered 30 per cent of the police. Nationalist politicians believed it was a successful policy however unionists stated that the policy had discriminated against Protestants. Calls have been made by Catholic clergymen for the policy to be restored until the force was 50:50.  Miscellaneous provisions  The act provided for cross-border support with the police of the Republic of Ireland, Garda S√≠och√°na, with the opportunities for PSNI officers to go on secondment with the Garda and vice versa. The act also stated that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had the power to decide the PSNI's uniform and flags. Their new uniform retained the rifle green colour of the Royal Ulster Constabulary but included name tags, against the wishes of the Police Federation. The Secretary of State would also be able to rule if the Union Jack would be able to fly over PSNI police stations as they had under the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

Its members, aged 12 to 21 years old, represent schools from all over the Northeastern Ohio region, and other states and foreign countries. The band, which functions both as a concert band and a marching band, performs in parades and competitions in locations all over the Midwest, and giving exhibition performances in venues all over the world. The band, nicknamed \\"The Squires\\" after their long-time former band director Donald W. \\"Squire\\" Hurrelbrink, has performed in every major parade in the United States, and on the White House lawn and for several presidents. Its noble and formal military style, which was preserved over the years by Hurrelbrink, is the trademark of the band to this day.The Warren Junior Military Band Official Website Band history The Warren Jr. Military Band is a community youth band in the Sousa tradition. Its purpose is music education and enrichment ‚Äì for members and audiences. But more than that, it is a family ‚Äì of band members, staff, parents, community volunteers, and alumni. The band originated in 1927 when St. Mary's School, Elm Rd, Warren discontinued its band program in response to an increasingly depressed economy. Just a block away, the members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Warren Post 1090, determined to keep the St. Mary's Band going. Starting with the members of the St. Mary's Band and welcoming students from other schools, the VFW Boys Band was organized by VFW member Colonel Lester Friend, who became the band's first manager, and Raymond Dehnbostel of the Dana School of Music, who became the band's first director. Donald W. \\"Squire\\" Hurrelbrink, a young Dana student, became Band Director in 1930 and directed the band continuously until 1996. He added girls to the band in 1945. Squire died on March 13, 1999. The band's current directors are Carl Snyder and Josh Hawkins. Chris Houser, Lauren Munroe, Tim Tuite, Jason Detec, Holly Ceci, Liz Hawkins, and Sarah Winston are associate staff members. Many of the staff are band alumni, and all have put in many years of service with the band. In 1957, the band became independent of outside sponsorship and incorporated as the Warren Junior Military Band. Its membership today includes young musicians from all over the Mahoning and Shenango Valleys and communities in southern Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Over the years, the band has amassed an impressive list of regional, national, and international honors and awards from all over the world. Performance tours have taken the band throughout the United States and to Hawaii, Great Britain, and Europe. The band has marched in nearly every major parade in the country, including Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and the Orange Bowl Parade. The concert band has played in city squares from Warren, Ohio, to Brussels, Belgium, and in concert halls from Youngstown, Ohio, to Zurich, Switzerland. It has played in the Palace Courtyard in Salzburg, Austria, and on the White House Lawn. The Warren Jr. Military Band continues today to be in great demand for concert, parade and field show performances throughout the areas in which it travels. Hurrelbrink served as the director of the band until his death in 1999, a tenure of almost 70 years . In 1972, \\"Squire\\" Hurrelbrink was honored as a recipient of the George Washington Award by the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge, an award shared by such notables as Walt Disney, Herbert Hoover, and John Glenn.The Freedom Foundation at Valley Forge‚ÄîList of Honored Recipients The band today is very active in the summer marching band competition circuit, and gives many free local performances.

Destry was based on the classic James Stewart Western, Destry Rides Again, and a subsequent remake, Destry, starring Audie Murphy. Premise In the original films the main character is Tom Destry, a Western lawman who is expert with a gun but still prefers to use non-violent means to settle problems with outlaws. In the television series John Gavin portrays Harrison Destry, son of Tom, who had been a lawman until he was framed for a crime and jailed. Destry therefore follows Harrison after his release from prison as he wanders the West in search of the people who framed him. As in the earlier feature films, many comedic situations arise as Destry goes to great lengths to avoid violence whenever troubles confront him. Gavin, in describing his character, stated, \\"To Destry, a hero is a man who thinks slower than a coward. While his father died with his boots on, Destry believes it is better to live with his boots on.\\" Production 160pxIn October 1963, the Los Angeles Times reported that Destry would be rushed into production to use John Gavin. The new series was assigned the broadcast timeslot of the recently cancelled 77 Sunset Strip. Some of the guest stars cast for Destry included Chris Alcaide, Med Flory, Ron Hayes, Roger Mobley, Stuart Randall, Barbara Stuart, and Olive Sturgess. Gavin in his role as the son of Tom Destry, was the fifth actor to play the character \\"Destry\\", following the film stars Tom Mix, James Stewart, Audie Murphy, and Joel McCrea. In a 1963 interview, Gavin described the character's personality and reflected on the role's importance within the context of his acting career: > When I came to Universal, they were making 40 pictures a year. I walked > through the gate, was given a contract, and immediately the number of > pictures dropped to eight or nine a year. I'm not complaining because I was > given good roles... roles with scope and breadth. But I wish I could have > been put in 40 or 50 roles before making my 'first' picture, do you know > what I mean? Doing a series now is like putting the cart before the horse. > I'm glad to be doing 'Destry' now though because of the experience. My gosh, > I've shot more film in the last five weeks than I have in my entire life... > It's a role I can play with a great deal of naivete. Destry is the sort of > man who if he sees trouble will ride around it. He says the difference > between a hero and a coward is that a coward can think faster.... Hopefully > Destry is not always a fool or a clown. He's wandering the west for a few > years and he's pretty wise, not brilliant or intelligent but he's been > kicked in the head a few times and he knows what's going on. Reception During the original broadcast of the series, the Los Angeles Times described Destry as \\"lacklustre...a routine, second-grade hoss opry\\", while The New York Times judged it to be the \\"pedestrian telling of an awkward adventure\\". Television audiences apparently agreed with those assessments, for Destry never attracted a sizable audience and was cancelled after just 13 episodes. Gavin blamed that lack of success, at least in part, to the departure of the network executive who had commissioned the show.

The company is engaged in crude oil processing and the production, distribution and sales of fuels and petrochemical products ‚Äì mainly plastics and fertilisers ‚Äì in the Czech Republic and the Central European region. It is the only crude oil processing company in the Czech Republic and its earnings rank it among the ten largest Czech companies. It was founded in 1994, and in 2004, it became part of the PKN Orlen group, which owns 100% shares in the company. The following companies have been gradually incorporated into Unipetrol: Kauƒçuk, Chemopetrol, Benzina, Paramo, Koramo(merged with Paramoin 2003), ƒåesk√° rafin√©rsk√°, Unipetrol Trade, Spolana, and Unipetrol Rafin√©rie. The Unipetrol group includes refineries and production plants in Litv√≠nov and Kralupy nad Vltavou, Paramo in Pardubice and Kol√≠n with its Mogul brand and Spolana in Neratovice, and two research centres in Litv√≠nov and Brno. The network of Benzina fuel stations ‚Äì the largest network in the Czech Republic with its 406 stations ‚Äì is also part of Unipetrol. Since 2018, the Chairman of the Board has been Krzysztof Zdziarski.  Unipetrol group history  The beginning of the Unipetrol group dates back to 1939, when the development of the STW chemical plant in Z√°lu≈æ√≠ u Litv√≠nova was initiated. In 1975‚Äì1976, polypropylene and polyethylene production plants were commissioned, and the ethylene unit was put into operation in 1979. Two years later, the development of a new refinery in Litv√≠nov (NRL) was completed. The year 1993 saw the restructuring of the refinery-petrochemical industry, including Chemopetrol at that time, which was later incorporated into Unipetrol. Unipetrol was founded in 1994 by the National Property Fund in one of the stages of the privatisation of the Czech petrochemical industry. In 1996, the Chemopetrol refineries in Litv√≠nov and Kauƒçuk in Kralupy were separated into a company called ƒåesk√° rafin√©rsk√°. Privatisation In 2001, Zeman‚Äôs government decided to initiate the privatisation process of the majority state share. Although the joint privatisation committee suggested the winner should be the British company RotchEnergy, which offered 444 mil. euro (about 14.5 bil. CZK), in December 2001 the government decided to sell it to the Czech company Agrofert for 361 mil. euro (about 11.7 bil. CZK at that time). Agrofert however never paid for the transaction and asked for the privatisation agreement to be terminated; therefore ≈†pidla‚Äôs government decided on a new public tender in November 2002. In January 2004, seven companies or syndicates made a preliminary offer in the privatisation tender. From the six valid bids, the offers by the Slovakian Penta Finance, Russian Tatnƒõft and Kazakh state-owned company KazMunaiGas (which offered the highest ceiling within 9-16 bil. CZK) were rejected. The government selected only the preliminary offers of the Polish company PKN Orlen (supported by Agrofert), the Hungarian MOL, and Shell for the short list. The final offer was then filed by PKN Orlen alone ‚Äì 11.3 bil. CZK for a 63% share in Unipetrol and 1.7 bil. CZK for the claims of ƒåKA against Unipetrol companies. This offer was accepted by the government in April 2004, and the sale was completed in 2005.  The present  In April 2015, the transaction related to the purchase of a 32.445% share in ƒåesk√° rafin√©rsk√° from the company Eni International B. V. was successfully completed. Unipetrol thus became the sole shareholder of ƒåesk√° rafin√©rsk√°. In December 2015, Unipetrol RPA, represented on the retail market by the Benzina trademark, entered into an agreement with OMV on the takeover of 68 fuel stations in the Czech Republic. As part of the restructuring of the Unipetrol group, Unipetrol RPA and Benzina were merged under the name Unipetrol RPA at the end of 2015. Benzina thus started to operate as a branch office. In June 2016, Unipetrol RPA signed an agreement on the purchase of shares from Anwil, thanks to which it acquired a 100% share in the company Spolana. Socially beneficial activities and sponsoring In 2016, Unipetrol RPA founded the Unipetrol Foundation, which is oriented towards study and education in the chemical and technical fields. Unipetrol supports the development of the educational system and the regions in which it operates in. On a long-term basis, Unipetrol together with its employees gives financial support to non- profit organisations and children‚Äôs homes through the collection called Splnƒõn√° p≈ô√°n√≠ (Fulfilled Wishes). Since 2011, it has distributed more than 1.5 million crowns. In addition, it distributes millions to municipalities in its vicinity every year. The funds are used by the municipalities for the development of their infrastructure and activities in the social sphere, culture, social life and sports. The company has a long-term tradition of introducing fish to the B√≠lina and Elbe rivers. Since 2010, fishermen together with Unipetrol have introduced more than 4,500 kilograms of fish. More than 2,000 kg of fish has been introduced by fishermen into a tributary of the Elbe since 2013. In cooperation with the ecological organisation Alka Wildlife, Unipetrol takes care of the peregrine falcons which nest every year on chimneys in the production complexes in Litv√≠nov, Kralupy nad Vltavou and Neratovice. In 2018, beehives were installed in the complex of the old chocolate and saccharine production plant in Spolana Neratovice. The high quality of the extracted floral honey was confirmed by tests run by an accredited laboratory of the Bee Research Institute. Since 2002, Unipetrol has been a strategic partner of the University of Chemistry and Technology Prague. In 2015, the University Centre of UCT Prague ‚Äì Unipetrol was established, with its registered office in the production complex of Unipetrol in Litv√≠nov, at which both Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs can be studied. Unipetrol also gives financial support to secondary schools and their students, in particular the ScholaHumanitas schools in Litv√≠nov and EDUCHEM in Mezibo≈ô√≠ u Litv√≠nova. Science and research Unipetrol emphasises research and development in the refinery and petrochemical areas. It collaborates with many domestic and foreign expert worksites both on school premises and in the commercial sphere. The Unipetrol group includes two research and educational centres oriented towards refinery products (Litv√≠nov) and petrochemical products (Brno) UniCRE - http://www.unicre.cz/ In 2014, the Unipetrol v√Ωzkumnƒõ vzdƒõl√°vac√≠ centrum, a.s.

The premise of the story involves the meeting of Iorek Byrnison and Lee Scoresby: The Guardian carried an \\"exclusive\\" extract from the book under the heading Winds of Chance on 22 March 2008.Philip Pullman, ‚ÄúWinds of chance,‚Äù The Guardian, 22 March 2008, Review section. The book launch took place on 31 March in Oxford during the Oxford Literary Festival.Andrew Ffrench, \\"Pullman Draws Crowds from Afar\\", Oxford Mail, 1 April 2008 Plot Lee Scoresby, a 24-year-old young Texan aeronaut, and his d√¶mon, the jackrabbit Hester, make a rough landing in Novy Odense, a harbour town on an island in the White Sea, in Muscovy. After paying for the storage of their balloon, Lee and Hester make their way into town, where Lee notes with surprise the presence of bears: some working, some just loitering about. He enters a bar to get something to eat and drink, and falls into conversation with a local journalist, Oskar Siggurdson, who explains that an election for Mayor of Novy Odense will take place later in the week. Siggurdson tells Lee that the overwhelming favourite ‚Äî not the incumbent mayor, but a man called Ivan Dimitrovich Poliakov ‚Äî has as a central policy a campaign to deal with the bears which hang around the town. Oskar mentions that the bears, once a proud race, now rank as \\"worthless vagrants\\". Lee learns with amazement that these bears are intelligent, can speak, and make and wear their own armour, though laws make it illegal for the bears to wear their armour in Novy Odense. At this point Lee intervenes in a conflict elsewhere in the bar, preventing the barkeeper from beating a drunk Dutch captain called van Breda, who has a ship tied up in the harbour but does not have permission to load his cargo and leave. Lee and van Breda get thrown out of the bar. Lee finds lodgings at a boarding-house and meets some of the fellow-guests over the evening meal: a young librarian called Miss Lund, a photographer, and an economist called Mikhail Ivanovich Vassiliev. Lee and Vassiliev attend a meeting at the town hall organised by the mayoral candidate Poliakov. Armed men in purple uniforms patrol the meeting: Lee takes them for customs officers. Vassiliev corrects him, explaining that they are security men from Larsen Manganese, a large mining company that are in league with Poliakov. Vassiliev mentions that they have a large gun they are looking to use in a riot situation, but their conversation is interrupted when Lee runs into Siggurdson. Siggurdson introduces him to Olga Poliakova, Poliakov's daughter. While he is initially attracted to her, Lee is put off by her lack of intelligence. Lee falls asleep and therefore misses Poliakov's speech, but once it is over Siggurdson insists on introducing Lee to the politician. Poliakov offers to employ Lee as a mercenary, to help him take care of a situation at the harbour. Lee is about to agree when he spots another of Poliakov's associates, a man Poliakov introduces as Pierre Morton. Lee recognises the man, whom he met using the name Pierre McConville. Lee met McConville while working for a rancher called Lloyd, who got into a boundary dispute with a neighbour. This neighbour hired McConville to kill Lloyd's men one by one, including Lloyd's nephew, Jimmy Partlett, who was shot dead in front of a number of witnesses. Only one of these witnesses was willing to tell the truth in court, and when McConville was acquitted by a corrupt jury he shot the witness dead in the street and rode out of town. He was rearrested and sent to the capital of the province with an armed escort, but vanished en route. Recognising Morton as this enemy from his past, Lee turns down Poliakov's offer of employment, and leaves. In the middle of the night, back at the boarding-house, Lee hears Miss Lund crying and asks the cause. Miss Lund cryptically asks for his advice on a matter of honour. Lee gives his advice as well as he can understand the situation, to Miss Lund's gratitude. Lee returns to his bed baffled about what has just happened, but Hester berates him, saying that Miss Lund has obviously received a proposal of marriage, and Lee advised her to accept. At breakfast the next morning Vassiliev explains that Miss Lund has a sweetheart in the Customs Office. During their conversation, Lee realises that the situation that Poliakov wanted him to deal with is most likely connected to Captain van Breda. Lee heads down to the harbour to investigate. He runs into van Breda again, who has still not been allowed to load his cargo. The two men head to a bar for a drink. Lee learns that van Breda's cargo, mining equipment and rock samples, is being held on a legal technicality, and will be impounded and sold at auction unless he loads it by the next day. Unfortunately, van Breda is being prevented from loading his cargo. The captain insists that Poliakov is waiting for his cargo to be impounded and will then buy it at a low price at auction. Lee, disgusted by Poliakov's behaviour, offers to help break into the warehouse and stand guard while van Breda loads his cargo. Van Breda gratefully accepts, and the two head for the harbour. On the pavement outside the bar, Lee is waylaid by one of the bears, who introduces himself as Iorek Byrnison. Iorek also offers to help van Breda, to get back at Poliakov. Iorek puts on the only piece of armour he currently has ‚Äì a battered helmet ‚Äì and the group set off, attracting a large crowd of onlookers as they near the harbour. Talking his way past the Harbour Master, Lee stands off against a group of men guarding the warehouse. Lee shoots one of them in the hip, knocking him into the water. The other men pull him out and then scatter. At that point the Larsen Manganese men deploy the riot gun mentioned by Vassilev earlier, but before they can do anything with it Iorek overturns it and pushes it into the harbour. With Iorek's help, Lee breaks into the warehouse. Van Breda gives him the Winchester rifle kept on-board his boat, and Lee heads up the floors to deal with the two gunmen positioned up there. He shoots the first in the shoulder and gets into a firefight with the second. The wounded man tries to strangle Hester, but Lee shoots him dead. The remaining gunman turns out to be Morton, who manages to shoot Lee in the shoulder and ear. Taunting him with the story of how he killed his armed escorts ‚Äì by tying one of them to the ground, binding his daemon to a horse and forcing the two apart to an unbearable distance, causing the man to die an agonising death ‚Äì Morton moves in for the kill, his snake daemon advancing ahead of him. Hester pounces on Morton's daemon and drags it towards Lee, forcing Morton to come stumbling out of his hiding place in pain. Lee shoots him in the chest, declares this revenge for what happened to Jimmy Partlett, and then shoots him dead. Outside, Larsen Manganese security men led by Poliakov have surrounded the warehouse. Before they can do anything, a group of Customs officers led by Lieutenant Haugland arrive, disperse the soldiers and crowd, and arrest Lee. Van Breda leaves with his ship and cargo, insisting that Lee keep the rifle as a token of thanks. It emerges that this is the same rifle Lee has when he is killed in his final gunfight, thirty-five years later. Haugland takes Lee back to the depot where his balloon is stored. On the way he explains that there is little the Customs board will be able to do to punish Poliakov, but they are still grateful to Lee for acting as he did. His balloon has been provisioned and made ready for departure, with all his belongings brought from the boarding house. Iorek arrives, and tends to Lee's wounds using bloodmoss. Lee has lost part of his ear. Oskar Siggurdson also arrives, but Lee pushes him into the harbour rather than giving an interview. Lee prepares to leave, thanking Haugland for his help. Haugland says that he should thank Miss Lund, who has just agreed to become his fianc√©e. Vassiliev comes running into the depot, warning them that Larsen Manganese men are on the way with orders to kill Lee and Iorek. Lee suggests the bear should escape with him on his balloon, and the armoured bear agrees, saying that the aeronaut is obviously a man of the Arctic. When Lee asks what he means, Iorek points to his daemon as an Arctic hare, much to Hester and Lee's surprise. The balloon then leaves and Lee, Hester and Iorek fly away together. The book ends with Lee remarking that he was amazed to learn Hester is a hare, to which she replies, \\"I always knew I had more class than a rabbit.\\" Extras As well as the main story, the book also contains a few extras. These include: * a board game called Peril of the Pole, mentioned in the story. * a newspaper article written by Oskar Siggurdson that offers a different spin on the events. It describes Lee and Iorek as villains and mentions that the incidents in Novy Odense merely serve to reinforce Ivan Dimitrovich Poliakov's belief as to the dangers of the bears. * two pages from The Elements of Aerial Navigation, a book that Lee won with the balloon and which he uses to help him fly. Lee only has the first half of the book. * a page from a book called The Shipping World Year Book, which includes an entry about Novy Odense. * two letters written by Lyra Silvertongue from St Sophia's College, Oxford.

In 1984, he had a loan spell in the Netherlands with NAC Breda. For Peterborough United, Cooper came off the bench to score a late diving header to win the 1992 Third Division play-off semi-final second leg against Huddersfield Town. He was inducted into the Airdrie United Hall of Fame in 2004 as recognition of his service to the club. He died in his sleep at his home in Yardley, Birmingham, on 15 February 2004, having unknowingly cracked his skull in a fall.

Transcribed by hand by John Septimus Roe, they are the source of best provenance for the majority of the journals' contents, the originals of which have been lost in most cases. During Roe's time as Surveyor General of Western Australia, Roe attempted to transcribe every journal of exploration in Western Australia into his Letterbook. As a result of his efforts, Western Australia has an exceptionally good record of its early explorations, nearly every significant journal being extant from 1827 until Roe's retirement in 1870. After 1870, however, the maintenance of exploration reports lapsed. The Survey Office retained Roe's Letterbook, and continued to hold journals and reports, but no attempt was made to collate or archive these in a sensible manner. In the 1920s, the Survey Office made typescript copies of Roe's Letterbook, but neither the typescript nor the originals were made accessible to the public until 1966, when the Battye Library took photocopies of the typescripts and bound them into six volumes, for use by the public. These volumes, entitled Exploration Diaries, are still the most accessible copies of the journals that Roe transcribed. However, they are not entirely reliable: many words, including some names of places and people, were transcribed incorrectly in the making of the 1920s transcript. The original Letterbook of Explorers' Journals remains the source of best provenance for most journals. It is now lodged with the State Records Office of Western Australia, where it is given item number 328 of Series 2117.

It is a scheduled monument, with the ruined church on top of the hill a Grade II listed building. The hill stands at a strategic location overlooking the point where the River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. Although there is some evidence of Roman visitation, the first fortification of the site was the construction of a Norman motte. It has been called King Alfred's Fort, however there is no proof of use by Alfred the Great. A medieval church was built on the hill in the 15th century. The current ruined church on top of the hill was built in 1793. The land and ruin were donated to the National Trust in 1946 as a war memorial. Geology Burrow Mump from the village of Burrowbridge The hill is high, and stands at a strategic point where the River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett, above the surrounding low lying land of the Somerset Levels. It is made of Triassic sandstone capped by Keuper marl ascribed to the Mercia Mudstone Group. Early use Burrow Mump is also known as St Michael's Borough or Tutteyate. Both words 'burrow' and 'mump' mean hill. Archaeological surveys have shown some Roman material including a piece of pottery and coins found nearby which, possibly linked to its situation at a river junction, may indicate its use for trade. Square pits, one of which may have been a well and post holes from the Middle Ages have been identified during excavations, these may have been from an adulterine castle. It is likely that it was a Norman motte with a terraced track that spirals around the hill to reach it. The plateau at the top is by and along with the scarped top of the slope formed the motte, which may have been formed during The Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. The site has been called King Alfred's Fort, but there is no evidence of it being a fort or having any link with Alfred the Great, apart from its ownership by the nearby Athelney Abbey which he established and was linked to Burrow Mump by a causeway. It may have served as a natural outwork to the defended royal island of Athelney at the end of the 9th century. Excavations have shown evidence of a 12th-century masonry building on the top of the hill, which may be from the probable adulterine castle. The side of the mound may have been terraced for agricultural use due to much of the surrounding land flooded on a regular basis during the medieval period. The ruins of St Michael's Church on top of Burrow Mump The first recorded writing mentioning this site is from William Worcester in about 1480 when he referred to it as Myghell-borough. A medieval church dedicated to St Michael, belonging to the Athelney Abbey, dates from at least the mid-15th century. This formed a sanctuary for royalist troops in 1642 and 1645 during the English Civil War, and a detachment of the king's army occupied it in 1685 during the course of the Monmouth Rebellion. 18th century rebuilding In 1793, the church was rebuilt with a west tower, 3-bay nave and south porch, in squared and coursed lias with red brick and Hamstone dressings. The attempt at total rebuilding ended in failure to collect enough money, despite donations from William Pitt the Younger and Admiral Hood, and a church for the community was built instead at the foot of the hill (Burrowbridge) in 1838. In the mid 20th century the ruin on Burrow Mump underwent some repairs to the north west corner. The ruined church is one of the churches dedicated to St. Michael that falls on a ley line proposed by John Michell. Other connected St. Michaels on the ley line include churches built at Othery and Glastonbury Tor. Memorial Memorial Plaque The site of including the hill and ruined church were presented, in 1946, by Major Alexander Gould Barrett, to the National Trust and serve as a memorial to the 11,281 Somerset men who lost their lives during the first and second world wars. The National Trust was taken to court for nuisance after soil from Burrow Mump slipped onto a neighbouring farmers land. The ruin was classified as a Grade II listed building in 1963. It has been a Scheduled monument since 1949.

Frontier Doctor is an American Western television series starring Rex Allen that aired in syndication from September 26, 1958, until June 20, 1959. The series was also known as Unarmed and Man of the West.TV Guide Guide to TV. Barnes & Noble. 2004. p. 238 . Outdoor action sequences for most episodes of Frontier Doctor were filmed on the Republic Pictures backlot in Studio City and on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, known for its huge sandstone boulders and widely recognized as the most heavily filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of Hollywood. Synopsis Frontier Doctor follows the exploits of a small town physician, Dr. Bill Baxter, who rides in a buggy with his black bag and encounters more than his share of trouble as he aids many who cross his path. Operating from the fictitious town of \\"Rising Springs\\", Dr. Baxter often finds difficulty with his patients, such as the outlaw Butch Cassidy. Allen was a native of Willcox, Arizona, and the program is set in the Arizona Territory. Several actors appear occasionally on the program, including Stafford Repp as Sheriff Brawley. A veteran Western movie actor and singer, Allen knew the genre, but this series failed to attract viewers. Speculation persists that Dr. Baxter was detached as a character and that Allen, an otherwise talented raconteur, delivered his lines in a bland fashion. Selected episodes In the 1958 episode \\"The Outlaw Legion\\", Dr. Baxter discovers that the men he is treating in a remote cabin are Butch Cassidy and members of the Hole in the Wall Gang. Native Canadian Joe Sawyer portrayed a boorish Cassidy. Doris Singleton, who had been cast in a supporting role on CBS's I Love Lucy sitcom, appeared as Laura, Cassidy's unhappy girlfriend who saves Dr. Baxter's life and tries to put her shady past behind her. Michael Ansara of Law of the Plainsman, appeared as Will Carver, a Cassidy henchman. In \\"Queen of the Cimarron\\" (1958), Jean Willes portrays Fancy Varden, the owner of the Golden Slipper saloon, who starts her own cattle ranch with animals infected with anthrax. The disease soon spread from the cattle to the cowhands. Glenn Strange, known as the character Sam Noonan, the bartender on Gunsmoke, and a cousin of Rex Allen, played the rancher Pat Cafferty. Also appearing in this episode are Robert Karnes as Marshal Dunham, Gregory Walcott as Red Redmond, and Harry Harvey, Jr., as Sam, one of the ill cowboys. In \\"The Twisted Road\\" (1959), two young women are strangled to death shortly after a brother and sister, Stan and Hester Gray, played by Robert Vaughn and Virginia Christine, arrive in Rising Springs. Stan is soon suspected in the slayings, but there is a surprise ending. Chubby Johnson was cast as Sheriff Ed Wilson, with Malcolm Atterbury as the father of one of the victims, Mary Ross. Alan Dinehart, III, who played Bat Masterson in thirty- four episodes of ABC's The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, was cast in this episode as Miller. In \\"Gringo Pete\\" (1959), Don Oreck portrayed the lead as an outlaw who pledges to surrender his gang to law enforcement officers in exchange for parole. Instead \\"Gringo Pete\\" resumes his life of lawlessness and dares the authorities. Ted de Corsia appears in this episode as Charlie Breen. John Ashley, prior to his role on ABC's 1961‚Äì1962 adventure drama series Straightaway, was cast in the 1959 episode, \\"Elkton Lake Feud\\", the story of a lingering dispute between two families over the ownership of the lake and the unwillingness of the losing side in court to accept the legal finding. In the series finale, \\"Flaming Gold\\", Dr. Baxter while returning from a medical convention stops off in Richville to visit a former patient and friend, a lawyer. As it develops, the lawyer while arguing a case against an oil company, died under mysterious circumstances. Baxter suspects that the company is responsible for the lawyer's death so that the junior partner, Hamilton (Mark Dana), who lacks experience in such matters, will take over the case. Gloria Winters of the syndicated aviation adventure series Sky King made her next-to-the-last career television appearance in this episode as a waitress in Richville.

Sikorsky Memorial Bridge (also known as the Sikorsky Memorial Bridge, and as the Housatonic River Bridge) carries the limited-access Merritt Parkway (Connecticut Route 15) over the Housatonic River, between Stratford and Milford, Connecticut. The first bridge on the site, known as the Sikorsky Bridge, was completed in 1940, marking the completion of the Merritt Parkway and the starting point for construction of the adjoining Wilbur Cross Parkway, September 2, 1940. It featured two lanes in each direction, and open steel grid decking that saved cost to stay within budget and was unpopular with drivers. A toll plaza stood at the eastern end of the Sikorsky Bridge until Connecticut abolished tolls in 1988, and is now preserved in Stratford at the Boothe Memorial Park and Museum. The Sikorsky Bridge was named after aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky, whose helicopter factory remains located north of the roadway, along the western riverfront, immediately north of the approach to the bridge (although visibilty of the display of his name on that facility -- which in the 21st century operates as a component of United Aircraft Corporation -- has been downgraded. After years of environmental studies, the Connecticut Department of Transportation awarded an $87 million contract to Balfour Beatty Construction to build the replacement bridge, the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge, in 2000. The southern half of the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge opened in 2003; the Sikorsky Bridge was demolished in 2004. In February 2004, the load unexpectedly shifted on a crane that was removing structural steel from the old bridge. The crane overturned and fell into the partially frozen Housatonic River, killing its operator. The remaining half of the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge was completed in 2006, two years behind schedule. The new bridge has a concrete deck, with an asphalt surface, three lanes in each direction, full left and right shoulders, a sidewalk for pedestrians, wrought-iron railing, and aesthetic lighting. The bridge also includes a system of concrete fenders that protects the bridge piers from ship collisions, a feature that was absent from the 1940 span. In 2006, the new bridge was formally dedicated as the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge.

It debuted at the 2008 North American International Auto Show, and first deliveries were in 2011. Production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012 due to bankruptcy of its battery supplier A123 Systems, with about 2,450 Karmas built since 2011 and over 2000 cars sold worldwide. In February 2014, Fisker Automotive's Karma vehicle design, tooling and a manufacturing facility in Delaware were purchased by Chinese auto parts conglomerate Wanxiang Group. Henrik Fisker, the founder of Fisker Automotive, retained the Fisker trademarks and the Fisker brand and launched a separate company, Fisker Inc., in 2016. Wanxiang later renamed its new company Karma Automotive.  History = 2007‚Äì2014  Henrik Fisker co-founded Fisker Automotive in 2007 with Fisker Coachbuild partner Bernhard Koehler and Quantum Technologies after securing U$5.2 million investment from Gianfranco Pizzuto, an Italian businessman, and Palo Alto Investors. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a venture capital firm, was one of the early investors. Fisker is responsible for designing many premium cars such as the Aston Martin DB9 and V8 Vantage, Artega GT, and BMW Z8. He also served as design director and sat on the board at Aston Martin. Before Fisker Automotive, Fisker and Koehler left Aston Martin in 2005 to establish Fisker Coachbuild, in an attempt to revive the art of coach-building automobiles to customer specifications. The Fisker Tramonto and Latigo used chassis and power trains from Mercedes-Benz SL and BMW 6 Series automobiles. Several were purchased, but the business soon gave way to Fisker Automotive, a true automobile manufacturer. In 2009, Fisker mentioned plans for another plug-in hybrid, a \\"high-volume vehicle for a lower price\\", subject to getting a U.S. Department of Energy loan to build about 100,000 vehicles annually in the United States. On April 14, 2008, Tesla Motors filed a lawsuit against Fisker Automotive, alleging they stole Tesla's technology and were using it to develop their own hybrid car, the Fisker Karma, which was announced at the North American International Auto Show in January 2008. Tesla's suit claimed that the design work done for the Model S by Fisker Coachbuild was substandard, and that Fisker diverted its best ideas to the Karma. In early 2009, the suit was settled in Fisker's favor and Tesla was ordered to pay Fisker more than US$1.1 million in legal fees. Fisker received a US$528.7 million conditional loan in September 2009 from the Department of Energy's US$25 billion Advanced Technologies Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM). Of the total loan amount approved, a total of US$192 million was drawn by Fisker Automotive for engineering work with primarily US suppliers to complete the Fisker Karma and Fisker's Project Nina, later revealed as the Fisker Atlantic. Vice President Joe Biden attended the October 27, 2009, announcement that Fisker Automotive would take control of the Boxwood Road Plant (previously owned and operated by General Motors as Wilmington Assembly) in Wilmington, Delaware, with production scheduled to begin in late 2012. Fisker's problems started with recall of its battery by A123 in December 2011, followed by a second recall by A123 Systems in March 2012 and eventually a bankruptcy of its battery supplier A123 Systems in August 2012, the costs involved regarding a recall and repairs to customer cars. In addition to production stopping for over five months, with no date announced to recommence, the planned production of the second model, the Fisker Atlantic, was postponed, together with the cessation of development of the new model. The Department of Energy froze Fisker's credit line in August 2012 after US$192 million had been drawn, and after differences between the DOE and Fisker on the milestones set as conditions for the loan. The loan received additional scrutiny for being awarded for the manufacture of luxury vehicles that are too expensive for much of the general public. Fisker investor Ray Lane responded that the issues were being blown out of proportion due to election-year politics. In February 2012, Tom LaSorda was named the new CEO, and Henrik Fisker became executive chairman, but six months later on August 14, La Sorda was replaced by Tony Posawatz, previously General Motors Vehicle Line Director for the Chevrolet Volt. In April 2012, Fisker announced it had received US$392 million in a new round of financing. The company suffered a setback on October 29, 2012, when Hurricane Sandy flooded and destroyed its entire European shipment of 338 Karmas at Port Newark, New Jersey. Sixteen of the cars burned, because six to eight feet of seawater caused a short circuit in a vehicle control unit in one Karma, and high winds spread the resulting fire to 15 others. The company said that its lithium-ion battery was not at fault. Insurer XL Insurance America initially denied the roughly US$30 million loss claim and was subsequently sued by Fisker in New York State Supreme Court. The case was settled with an undisclosed out-of- court agreement. Henrik Fisker resigned in March 2013, after \\"disagreements with management\\", in particular \\"disagreements over business strategy\\". Shortly after the departure of Henrik Fisker from Fisker Automotive, on April 5, 2013, Fisker laid off 75% of its workforce, retaining only a core group of 40 workers as it continued to negotiate with prospective investors. On October 11, 2013, Hybrid Technology LLC agreed to buy Fisker's defaulted government loan at a heavy discount. On November 22, 2013, Fisker filed its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. Concurrently, on November 23, 2013, Fisker agreed, subject to bankruptcy court approval, to be acquired by Hybrid, owned by Hong Kong billionaire, Richard Li. At the last moment, though, Chinese parts supplier Wanxiang Group submitted a competing bid of 24.75 million, supported by the Official Creditors' Committee in the case. Wanxiang had earlier lost out to Hybrid in bidding for purchase of the government's loan to Fisker. Wanxiang owns A123 Systems LLC, Fisker's former battery supplier, and Fisker argued that Wanxiang's conduct was partly responsible for Fisker's business failure. As part of its bid, Wanxiang proposed restarting production of the Karma. Wanxiang received court approval on February 18, 2014, to buy the assets of Fisker after a three-day auction against Hybrid with a bid of $149.2 million, with bidding starting at $55 million, significantly more than the previous $24.75 million bid, and significantly higher than the $25 million Hybrid Technology LLC paid the Department of Energy for a $164 million loan note. On top of the $25 million, the DOE also recouped $28 million from Fisker for a total of $53 million recovered of its $192 million loan.Bill Canis, Brent D.

Following Fisker Automotive's structured bankruptcy auction in February 2014, Henrik Fisker retained the Fisker brand name. Wanxiang Group bought the company's assets, which it turned into Karma Automotive, launching the Karma Revero plug-in hybrid car based on the Fisker Karma.Jon LeSage, \\"Henrik Fisker Putting His Name Back On New Premium Electric Car Company,\\" Hybrid Cars, October 4, 2016. Production models=Fisker Karma Fisker Karma outside the Fisker headquarters in Anaheim, California The Karma was a plug-in hybrid luxury sports sedan produced by Fisker Automotive and manufactured at Valmet Automotive in Finland. After missing its initial late 2009 launch, and after the launch was rescheduled several times, the first deliveries took place in the U.S. in late July 2011 and deliveries to retail customers began in November 2011. The 20.1 kWh (72.36 MJ) lithium ion rechargeable battery in each car came from A123 Systems in Watertown, Massachusetts. The aluminum frame was engineered by Fisker and was supplied by Norsk Hydro from Norway. The cabin interior was designed by Fisker Automotive, but was made in the United States by Magna International of Canada. The EVer powertrain system, technically a series hybrid, delivered over 400 horsepower, and was inspired by Quantum Technologies, a cofounder of and early investor in Fisker. A version of the Karma was relaunched as the Karma Revero in 2016 by Karma Automotive. Concept vehicles= Fisker Surf and Sunset Fisker Sunset concept The Fisker Surf was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show Fisker unveiled the Karma S hardtop convertible concept in 2009. The Fisker Surf plug-in hybrid concept car was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. The Surf would have an all-electric range of and an additional when the gasoline engine is engaged, acting as a generator to charge the battery pack. Like the Karma, the Surf operates in Sport or energy-saving Stealth modes. In Sport, the car can reach from 0 in 5.9 seconds and the maximum speed is . According to Henrik Fisker, the Surf would be part of the company's lineup and would be available for North American and international delivery in 2013. Price was expected be in the same range as the Karma. In early 2012, the company announced they were dropping their plans to produce the Surf and the Sunset. Instead, they decided to proceed with production of the Fisker Atlantic.  Fisker Atlantic  In April 2012, Fisker unveiled their model Atlantic at the 2012 New York International Auto Show. The Fisker Atlantic, originally called \\"Project Nina\\", shares the range-extender system from the larger Karma, but uses a four-cylinder BMW-sourced gasoline engine, which acts as a generator to keep the batteries charged. The Atlantic is rear-wheel drive, with the option of four-wheel drive.Stevens, Tim. \\"Fisker Atlantic EVer unveiled in New York\\" EnGadget April 3, 2012. Retrieved April 4, 2012. The expected all-electric range is . The Atlantic was scheduled to become Fisker Automotive's second production car, after plans to produce the Fisker Surf and Sunset variants of its full-sized Karma were shelved earlier in 2012. Production was initially scheduled to begin by the end of 2012 at the former GM plant in Wilmington, Delaware. By October 2012, the carmaker decided to postpone production for late 2014 or 2015 due to financial constraints. Sales  By February 2012, Fisker had established 45 dealerships in the US and three in Canada. By March 2012, the company had built over 2,450 vehicles, with over 2000 cars delivered to customers by the end of 2012. Fisker Automotive distributed vehicles through a traditional dealer network and partnered with five importers: GP Supercars (Merano, Italy), Nellemann (Copenhagen, Denmark); the Emil Frey Group (Zurich, Switzerland); BD Otomotive (Istanbul, Turkey) and Al-Futtaim Group (Middle East and North Africa).  Manufacturing  Fisker Automotive used to retain core competencies, such as design, engineering and marketing, in house, but outsourced manufacturing of its first vehicle Fisker Karma. Fisker's outsourcing methods allowed the company a 2‚Äì3 year period of development instead of the typical 5 years and at a cost of US$333 million instead of $1 billion, and claimed that it could make a profit from selling just 15,000 cars. Fisker used to save significant development costs by using pre-engineered components developed by other car companies whenever possible, such as the door handle mechanism which was a General Motors part; Fisker Automotive just paid a royalty to GM for each door handle in the Karma, which was much cheaper than designing its own door handles. However, the A123 battery failure and its resulting recall, and the eventual bankruptcy of the battery supplier, led to significant problems and added cost to the manufacture of the Karma model, finally resulting in Fisker's bankruptcy. In 2008, Fisker estimated 15,000 cars per year would be assembled by Valmet Automotive in Uusikaupunki, Finland. Manufacturing eventually commenced in 2011 but by the third quarter of 2012 production ceased.  Investors  Fisker Automotive's investors have included Leonardo DiCaprio, Palo Alto Investors, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Qatar Holdings, LLC, A123 Systems, and Ace Investments. In April 2012, Fisker announced it had received $392 million in a round of financing, which was in addition to $850 million in private investment it had received in previous rounds. In Fisker's bankruptcy case, Hybrid Technology LLC ranked ahead of all the equity investors as a senior creditor since they purchased the Department of Energy loan note to Fisker Automotive in November 2013.

Built in 1898, the building was demolished in 1966. During the process of being demolished the building, along with the Old City Hall, became a rallying force for historic preservation in Omaha. About A 1900 street scene including the Old Post Office. The Old Post Office began construction in 1892 with $1.2 million in appropriations from the federal government. The outside of the building was covered with St. Cloud pink granite on the first story; on the next three floors sandstone was used. Polished granite columns held up stone archways on each of the five entrances, and on the east side was the main entrance. It was capped with a clock tower, with clocks on all four sides. A copper roof covered the entire building, except for the atrium court in the center, which was covered by a -square skylight. In the early years the building was identified as \\"The Custom House\\". A formal opening was held in 1898; however, because of delays the building was not completely finished until 1906. The building was first identified for demolition by Omaha's civic leaders in the 1930s, who thought of it as an eyesore in a modern metropolitan city. Additionally, they believed that the prime commercial real estate it sat on could be better utilized otherwise.Bednarek, J.R.D. (1992) The Changing Image of the City: Planning for Downtown Omaha, 1945-1973. University of Nebraska Press. p 177. In the early 1960s the General Services Administration declared the building too costly to maintain and quickly built a new facility. Despite several suggested plans to renovate the facility, First National Bank of Omaha demolished the building in 1966.Landmarks, Inc. (2003) Building for the Ages: Omaha's Architectural Landmarks. Quebecor Books. p 27. One innovative idea was suggested by Joseph A. Suneg as early as February 12, 1939. He was planning a design for a new Catholic church at 62nd and Dodge Street and proposed salvaging the granite blocks. They would be marked, stored and later reconstructed into a church patterned after the post office.Sunday World-Herald: Omaha, NE, ‚ÄúPriest Would Use Postoffice Granite to Build Church‚Äù February 12, 1939, p 7-A More than 50 years after the building was razed, Douglas County Historical Society created the Ethel C. Flannigan Memorial Architectural Garden that showcases four granite pieces salvaged from the 1898 structure.Gerber, Kristine ‚ÄúSalvage on Display in the New Crook House Garden‚Äù Restoration Exchange Newsletter, September 26, 2017 Granite architectural elements salvaged from the Old Post Office (Omaha) The new post office in Omaha. In 1966 the City of Omaha approved a plan for First National Bank to build an office tower and adjoining high-rise Hilton Hotel complex on the site of the Old Post Office. The City allowed the new buildings to be built on 16th Street which effectively blocked the main north-south street connecting the downtown commercial district with the adjacent North Omaha area. Critics charged that the closure of 16th Street was a heavy-handed attempt to inhibit the flow of blacks from the predominantly African-American North Omaha at time of a fear of rising social unrest and riots nationwide. Legacy Landmarks, Inc. was organized in 1965 because of concern for the imminent demolition of the Old Post Office. This group has organized the Omaha community since around saving the city's landmarks.

They were a Piman or O'odham group who occupied southern Arizona and northern Sonora (the Pimer√≠a Alta) in the 15th-19th centuries. They were a subgroup of the O'odham or Pima, surviving members of which include the residents of San Xavier del Bac which is now part of the Tohono O'odham Nation and the Akimel O'odham. Debate sometimes still arises as to whether the Sobaipuri and other O'odham groups are related to the prehistoric Hohokam who occupied a portion of the same geographic area and were present until about the 15th century. This question is sometimes phrased as the \\"Hohokam-Pima\\" or \\"Salado-Pima continuum\\", a phraseology that questions whether there is a connection between the prehistoric Hohokam and the first historic groups cited in the area. A key piece of the puzzle has recently been found when it was discovered that there was Sobaipuri (O'odham) present in the late prehistoric period (Seymour 2007a, 2011a, 2011b, 2014). Chronometric dates from multiple sites on the San Pedro and Santa Cruz rivers have produced evidence of Sobaipuri occupation in the 14th century (Seymour 2007, 2008, 2011a, 2011b; www.sobaipuri.com) and some even earlier, perhaps as early as the 13th century. The position is no longer defensible that no one was present after 1400 CE and that there was a substantial population decline in the prehistoric period (Seymour 2007c,d, 2011a, 2011b). Traditional stories help confirm the idea that there was likely a clash between the newly arriving O'odham, including the Sobaipuri-O'odham and the extant groups including the Hohokam and Western Puebloan groups. The issue of a continuum is implausible because archaeological and oral histories demonstrate that the local residents intermixed with and became O'odham. Archaeology and history The Sobaipuri were present when the first Europeans visited the area in the middle 16th century, thereby playing an important role in European contact and later the European colonization of Arizona. Marcos de Niza probably encountered this group along the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona in 1539, although when Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado followed less than a year later his party of explorers seems to have turned before reaching the Sobaipuri settlements (Seymour 2009a, 2011a). When Father Eusebio Kino first arrived in the area in 1691 he was greeted by leaders of this group. Headmen from San Cayetano del Tumacacori and perhaps other villages had come to Saric, Mexico from the north to ask that Kino visit them. Kino traveled north along the Santa Cruz River to San Cayetano de Tumacacori (later moved to the modern location of Tumac√°cori National Historical Park and renamed), where he found three native-made structures that had been constructed specially for him: a house, a kitchen, and one for saying mass (Bolton 1948). This visit to this first of the Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert north of the current international border made this native Sobaipuri settlement the first mission in southern Arizona, or the first Jesuit mission in Arizona, but, contrary to popular notions, not the first mission in Arizona. This original native Sobaipuri settlement of San Cayetano del Tumacacori has been located archaeologically on the east side of the river (as shown on Kino's historic maps), providing evidence of a densely packed, well-planned, long-occupied village (Seymour 2007a, 2011a). Kino then stopped by Guevavi (later referred to as Mission Los Santos √Ångeles de Guevavi), which is located to the south along the Santa Cruz River. Here he later (1701) established a church which he ordered whitewashed. The location of this native settlement and this formal church has been identified (Seymour 1993, 1997, 2008b, 2011a). This native settlement later became the head mission for this region. The Sobaipuris were initially friendly with their neighbors, including the Apache, Jocome, and Jano (Seymour 2007b, 2008a). They traded with one another and they were cited sometimes raiding together. They even intermarried, probably creating the unique character of the Sobaipuri. Later they sided with the Europeans which stressed their relationship with the unconverted tribes, because Sobaipuris then went into battle against the others. Archaeological research The Sobaipuri are one of the most-studied protohistoric (or late prehistoric and early historic) groups in southern Arizona, although this is not saying much as the protohistoric (late prehistoric and early historic) are less studied than most other time periods, especially in this area. The accompanying list of references shows the upsurge of research in this group by archaeologists in the past 30 years. Prior to this most of the research was conducted by historians. The first archaeological work was initiated by Charles C. Di Peso (1953, 1956) of the Amerind Foundation who established a program designed to understand the transition from prehistory to history. Although most of his conclusions about sites visited by Father Eusebio Kino have been discredited, Di Peso is recognized as a true scholar and he did define the first archaeological Sobaipuri site, making key contributions to the field, some of which are only recently being recognized. The other sites he thought might be Sobaipuri turned out to be late prehistoric sites representing Puebloan and other culture groups or the remnants of a later Spanish fort Santa Cruz de Terrenate. Archaeologist Deni Seymour has studied the Sobaipuri for 30 years, revisiting some of the issues raised by Di Peso. On the San Pedro, Santa Cruz, and tributary drainages of Sonoita creek, Babocomari, and Aravaipi Seymour has documented more than 80 archaeological sites occupied by the Sobaipuri (Seymour 1989, 1990, 1993a). She has mapped portions of their extensive irrigation systems and noted how their agriculture-based villages drifted along the river margins as groups grew and splintered through time (Seymour 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2011a, 2011b, 2013). Excavations on several Sobaipuri sites have led her to revise conclusions that have arisen from use of the documentary record alone. In the early 1980s, archaeologist Bruce Masse (1981) excavated Sobaipuri sites on the lower (northern) San Pedro River, revising many of Di Peso's original perspectives and summarizing the state of knowledge about this group to that date. Only a few residential sites have been found away from the rivers. Archaeologist Bruce Huckell (1994) documented three archaeological sites in the shadow of the Santa Rita Mountains north of Sonoita, Arizona. These sites were probably used seasonally for hunting and gathering or possibly as refuge sites to escape Spanish, or possibly Apache, domination.

Her name was a pseudonym, she chose not to make public her birth name. Newman was born in Dover, Kent, the daughter of a reporter on the Kentish Mercury (who was born in India) and a mother who worked in an office during World War II (who was born in Jamaica). An only child, she taught at a grammar school after graduating with a degree in English from the Westfield College, University of London. A film version of her novel Three into Two Won't Go (1967), with a screenplay by Edna O'Brien, was released in 1969. It starred Rod Steiger and Claire Bloom, and was directed by Peter Hall. She adapted one of her short stories \\"The Night of the Stag\\" for The Frighteners, an anthology series produced by London Weekend Television (LWT).The Sunday Times; The 100 hottest tickets of the year 10 January 2010. Helen: A Woman of Today was another LWT drama recounting the side of a wronged wife for which Newman wrote two episodes. Having been commissioned by Tony Wharmby for both projects, Newman sent hims a copy of A Bouquet of Barbed Wire (1969) as a present; the book was by then out of print. Newman adapted what was her sixth novel. Broadcast from early January 1976, Bouquet of Barbed Wire (losing the indefinite article) as a seven-part serial, it had audiences of 20 million. Newman recalled her work in 2010 at the time when it was being remade: \\"I never set out to shock, just to tell a story about an imaginary family, but I imagine most people would still disapprove of hitting your pregnant wife and having sex with her mother.\\" Its sequel, Another Bouquet, followed in 1977. Another novel, Mackenzie, was dramatized by the BBC in 1980, starring Jack Galloway, Lynda Bellingham and Tracey Ullman. This adaptation was followed by Alexa (1968 ‚Äì adapted for the BBC, 1982), A Sense of Guilt (1988 ‚Äì adapted for the BBC, 1990), and An Evil Streak (1977 ‚Äì adapted for LWT, 1999). In 2001, Newman was the writer for the television drama Pretending to Be Judith. Her other novels included A Share of the World (1964), Mirage (1965), The Cage (1966) and A Gift of Poison (1991). Triangles, a book of 15 short stories, was published in 1990. It was remarked that a frequent theme in Andrea Newman's novels was that with the advent of a baby, the family disintegrates. Newman married Terence Nolan in 1959 while studying at university, though the couple later divorced. She died in London in November 2019, aged 81, after suffering from breast cancer since 2004.

The film takes the setting of a silent film with narration provided by John Le Mesurier of Dad's Army fame, this too was some of his last work prior to his death in 1983. The film centres on a Lord who lives in a castle (the film was made entirely on location at Hever Castle) and his Lady the latter of which attracts the amorous attentions of the titular character. The plot centres on the pilgrim's failed attempts to gain entry to the castle by any means possible, and the lengths the lord will go to in order to stop him. In one memorable scene once the assailant has gained entry the lord brandishes an aerosol can labelled \\"Knight-Rid\\" to stop the pilgrim in his tracks Further filming at Hever was planned May 1984 as filmmaker Charles Wallace intended to expand the film using Beryl Reid to play Eric's mother, and another damsel in the cast. Morecambe's death ensured that further scenes were not made, but the film was released in its original shorter form. The film was released with the James Bond movie Octopussy and WarGames (see production company website movingimageco.com). It was later shown on numerous cable TV channels and was released in 1994 on VHS at a time of resurgence in interest in the work of Morecambe and Wise, the BBC having screened a three (late expanded to five) part tribute to mark the tenth anniversary of his death. It has subsequently also been released on DVD and is widely available, more so in fact than the bulk of the duo's hugely successful television series.

A singer would be engaged for a single performance or for regular performances over an extended period of time. Famous naamyam singers included Chung Tak (1860-1929), Dou Wun (1910-1979), Yuen Siu-Fai and Au Kwan-Cheung. History Before the first half of the 20th century, naamyam sung by blind singers was a popular form of entertainment in Canton and Hong Kong. Common venues for performance included public places such as restaurants, teahouses, brothels, and opium dens, semi-public clubs and gathering places that catered to a particular trade or craft, such as butchers or rice merchants, and private households. Naamyam has rarely been performed in its traditional context since the middle of the twentieth century. The rapidly changing society, with the exploding growth of modern entertainment means, spelled the death of traditional performing genre such as naamyam. However, some Cantonese opera performers borrowed some of the techniques of naamyam singings in their performances. Instrument The singing accompanied by a musical instrument such as the guzheng (bridged zither), yehu (coconut-shell bowed lute), or yangqin (hammered dulcimer), together with the percussion instrument ban (wooden clappers). The instrument or instruments were played either by the singer himself/herself or in duo with a fellow musician. Songs Some naanyam songs are relatively short, taking about twenty minutes to perform; they are generally lyrical in nature, expressing thoughts and moods rather than relating a complicated story. A common theme in these songs is lamentation over lost love in the houses of pleasure. These songs tend to have a relatively fixed test, very often attributed to a known author of a scholarly bent. The text tends to be literary rather than colloquial, refined in its choice of words and phrases, and regular in its verse structure. Such a naamyam song was sung as a unit in one sitting, with no spoken lines. The best known example is the song Ketu Qiuhen (Wayfarer's Autumn Lament), in which the singer yearns for the love of a courtesan whom he has left behind in his wanderings. Naamyam songs can also be very long, with hundreds or even thousands of lines, requiring tens or even hundreds of hours to perform. These songs are adapted from well-known historical events, legends, and fictions. In telling these long stories, the singer would alternate between short, spoken passages in verse. These long songs were normally improvised in performance, even though printed texts were published for consumption by readers. By not following a fixed text, the singer gains great flexibility in manipulating the story through the addition, elimination, or rearrangement of plot elements. The singer also improvises in the manner of expressing these plot elements through his choice of words and phrases, giving more or less detailed exposition to the plot elements depending upon the amount of time he has available for singing. Structure The textual unit in a naamyam song is a quatrain in verse, with verse structure similar to classical poetry. Each line of the quatrain has the basic pattern of seven syllables, with a caesura occurring after the first four syllables. Often some \\"padding\\" syllables are freely added. In the quatrains, the final syllable of each line, in particular lines 2 and 4, exhibits rhyme, both within a quatrain and through a number of them. A change of rhyme usually indicates that a new section of the story is beginning. Aside from rhyming, the final syllable of each line must also observe rules governing linguistic tones: the final syllables in lines 1 and 3 must exhibit oblique tones, those in lines 2 and 4 even tones. A further structural rule is that line 2 must end on an upper even tone, line 4 on a lower even tone. The music of naamyam consists basically of a single tune in four lines, matching the four lines of the text in the quatrain. Subsequent quatrains - and indeed all naamyam songs - are sung to the same four lines of tune. Even though the \\"same\\" tune is theoretically repeated every four lines, in practice the tune may vary depending upon the linguistic tones of the text. The singer adjusts to various pitch levels and melodic contours of the tune in accordance with the corresponding linguistic features of the text. However, the tune retains certain distinctive melodic features that give naamyam its stamp of musical identity. The tune may also undergo transformation in terms of tonal and rhythmic modes. Recording In 1975, Dr. Bell Yung of the University of Pittsburgh recorded Dou Wun's naamyam singings at Fu Long teahouse in Hong Kong, leaving 40 hours of live recordings and valuable photographs.

It is native to the southern half of Africa. It was formerly regarded as a subspecies of the northern white-faced owl (P. leucopsis) but the two are now commonly treated as separate species. It is long and weighs . The upperparts are grey with dark streaks and there are white spots on the scapular feathers. The underparts are whitish with dark streaks. The face is white with a black border and black around the large orange eyes. The head has two short \\"ear\\" tufts with black tips. Juvenile birds have a greyish face. The Northern White-faced Owl is usually paler and browner with reduced streaking below. Their call is a series of fast, bubbling hoots. It is uttered at night and frequently repeated. These fast, staccato notes followed by a longer and higher pitched ‚Äòhoot‚Äô are extensively used during breeding season and pairs of owls often sing together. The northern white-faced owl has a very different two-note call. Its range extends from Gabon eastwards to southern Kenya and southwards to Namibia and northern South Africa. It inhabits savanna and dry woodland. It is usually seen alone or in pairs. It mainly hunts large insects, as well as the occasional small mammals, birds and reptiles. The eggs are usually laid in the old nest of another bird. The clutch contains two or three eggs which are incubated for about 30 days. The young birds leave the nest about a month after hatching. Temperature Adaptability During the winter, Southern White-faced Scops-owls increase their resting metabolic rate by approximately 45% to adjust to the climate changes. Furthermore, the owls do this to increase cold temperature tolerance which is unusual for these creatures. Not only that, but their BMR of the owl is lower than what is expected of other birds similar to them to help them when there is lack of food. This is unusual considering the lack of food and other survival resources during the winter.(B.Smit, M.Brown, C.T.

Career Sandison was brought up in the Pennywell area of Edinburgh and attended school locally. He signed for Hearts at the age of 17. During his time with Hearts he was a reliable and versatile player. A highlight was his man-marking Herbert Prohaska, who was one of Europe's finest players at the time, out of the game in a European tie against Austria Vienna. The Jam Tarts won 1-0 in Austria. He was purchased for ¬£100,000 in 1991 by Airdrie manager Alex McDonald, who had been his manager at Hearts. Sandison was McDonald's first signing and was also made team captain. Soon after his move to Airdrie, Sandison was at the centre of a controversial refereeing decision in a 1991‚Äì92 Scottish League Cup semi final. The referee awarded a penalty kick to the opposition, Dunfermline Athletic, for handball by Sandison. The decision was greeted with amazement amongst many as Sandison had neither handled the ball nor been inside the box. He led the side for the entire decade he was there, wearing the armband in every single competitive game he played bar one. He captained the side throughout their 1991‚Äì92 Scottish Cup run, but missed the final due to suspension. Sandison was however captain during their only appearance in European competition as the Diamonds took part in the 1992‚Äì93 European Cup Winners' Cup. \\"Skip\\" as he was affectionately known to his teammates also captained them in the 1995 Scottish Cup Final. He is held as a cult hero in Airdrie for being the leader and backbone of some of the club's very best years. During this time Sandison had the reputation as being a technically gifted sweeper who was hard but fair and a player who was a true leader with a never say die attitude. After Airdrie were liquidated, Sandison went on, in the latter part of his career, to play for Stenhousemuir, under former chairman at Airdrie, George Peat. Sandison later went on to manage Bo'ness Junior team for three reasonably successful years between 2003 and 2006. In the Irvine Welsh novel Marabou Stork Nightmares, the character Sandy Jamieson is based on Sandison. Furthermore, in Welsh's book Trainspotting, one of the main characters reads a newspaper in which Sandison is on the back page of. He now still resides in Edinburgh with his wife Karen and son C.J. He works as a black cab driver in Edinburgh as well as doing media and ambassadorial work for his former club Hearts. He is also one of the hierarchy of the 1874 Fighting Fund, who helped stave off liquidation from Hearts and who are now the main fundraising group in support of the new regime after the club exited administration. More so he is captain of the Hearts legends team which includes players such as John Robertson, Gary Locke and Henry Smith. He was also inducted into the Airdrie Hall of fame in 2005.

Definition An asymmetric norm on a real vector space V is a function p:V\\\\to[0,+\\\\infty) that has the following properties: * Subadditivity, or the triangle inequality: p(v + w) ‚â§ p(v) + p(w) for every two vectors v,w ‚àà V. * Homogeneity: p(Œªv) = Œªp(v) for every vector v ‚àà X and every non-negative real number Œª ‚â• 0\\\\. * Positive definiteness: p(v) > 0 unless v = 0\\\\. Asymmetric norms differ from norms in that they need not satisfy the equality p(-v) = p(v). If the condition of positive definiteness is omitted, then p is an asymmetric seminorm. A weaker condition than positive definiteness is non-degeneracy: that for v ‚â† 0, at least one of the two numbers p(v) and p(-v) is not zero.  Examples  * On the real line R, the function p given by ::p(x) = \\\\begin{cases} x, & x \\\\leq 0; \\\\ 2 x, & x \\\\geq 0; \\\\end{cases} :is an asymmetric norm but not a norm. * In a real vector space V , the Minkowski functional p_B of a convex subset B\\\\subseteq V that contains the origin is defined by the formula :: p_B(v) = \\\\inf \\\\left{r \\\\geq 0: v \\\\in r B \\\\right}\\\\, for v\\\\in V :This functional is an asymmetric seminorm if B is an absorbing set, which means that \\\\textstyle{ \\\\bigcup_{r\\\\geq 0} r B = V }, and ensures that p(v) is finite for each v\\\\in V .  Corresponce between asymmetric seminorms and convex subsets of the dual space  If B^* \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb R^n is a convex set that contains the origin, then an asymmetric seminorm p can be defined on \\\\mathbb R^n by the formula ::\\\\textstyle{ p(v) = \\\\max_{\\\\varphi\\\\in B^*} \\\\langle \\\\varphi,v\\\\rangle }. For instance, if B^*\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb R^2 is the square with vertices (\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 1) , then p is the taxicab norm v=(v_0,v_1) \\\\mapsto v_0+v_1 . Different convex sets yield different seminorms, and every asymmetric seminorm on \\\\mathbb R^n can be obtained from some convex set, called its dual unit ball. Therefore, asymmetric seminorms are in one-to-one correspondence with convex sets that contain the origin. The seminorm p is * positive definite if and only if B^* contains the origin in its interior, * degenerate if and only if B^* is contained in a linear subspace of dimension less than n , and * symmetric if and only if B^*=-B^* .

It was built by James Renwick, Jr. in the Second Empire style in 1861, the second building in the history of what was one of America's first women's colleges. It is one of the earliest, largest, and most important examples of Second Empire architecture in the United States and is a National Historic Landmark for its architecture and educational significance. At the time of its completion, the structure contained the most interior space of any building in the United States, and housed the entire college, including dormitories, libraries, classrooms, and dining halls. Currently, the first and second floors house campus administration while the remaining three (including the second floor wings) house student rooms. Architecture Vassar's Main Building is a large brick building, four stories in height, with a fifth floor under its mansard roof. It is U-shaped, with a central portion long, and transverse wings in length projecting forward at the ends of the central section. At the center of the central portion is a projecting pavilion topped by a slate-roofed dome with iron cresting. Most windows are sash, set in openings with either segmented-arch or round-arch tops; the roof is pierced by dormers whose rounded tops have keystones. Window trim and horizontal banding on the building are of bluestone. The building has in significant part been restored to its original appearance. One notable exception is a large turning staircase in the central section, which was removed in 1893 as part of a library expansion that became known as \\"Uncle Fred's Nose\\", after Fred Thompson, whose name adorned the annex that was added at that time. That annex was removed in 1959 during the restoration process, but the stairs were not rebuilt.

Howard Georgi proposed this theory in two 2007 papers, \\"Unparticle Physics\\" and \\"Another Odd Thing About Unparticle Physics\\". His papers were followed by further work by other researchers into the properties and phenomenology of unparticle physics and its potential impact on particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology, CP violation, lepton flavour violation, muon decay, neutrino oscillations, and supersymmetry. Background All particles exist in states that may be characterized by a certain energy, momentum and mass. In most of the Standard Model of particle physics, particles of the same type cannot exist in another state with all these properties scaled up or down by a common factor ‚Äì electrons, for example, always have the same mass regardless of their energy or momentum. But this is not always the case: massless particles, such as photons, can exist with their properties scaled equally. This immunity to scaling is called \\"scale invariance\\". The idea of unparticles comes from conjecturing that there may be \\"stuff\\" that does not necessarily have zero mass but is still scale-invariant, with the same physics regardless of a change of length (or equivalently energy). This stuff is unlike particles, and described as unparticle. The unparticle stuff is equivalent to particles with a continuous spectrum of mass. Such unparticle stuff has not been observed, which suggests that if it exists, it must couple with normal matter weakly at observable energies. Since the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) team announced it will begin probing a higher energy frontier in 2009, some theoretical physicists have begun to consider the properties of unparticle stuff and how it may appear in LHC experiments. One of the great hopes for the LHC is that it might come up with some discoveries that will help us update or replace our best description of the particles that make up matter and the forces that glue them together. Properties Unparticles would have properties in common with neutrinos, which have almost zero mass and are therefore nearly scale invariant. Neutrinos barely interact with matter ‚Äì most of the time physicists can infer their presence only by calculating the \\"missing\\" energy and momentum after an interaction. By looking at the same interaction many times, a probability distribution is built up that tells more specifically how many and what sort of neutrinos are involved. They couple very weakly to ordinary matter at low energies, and the effect of the coupling increases as the energy increases. A similar technique could be used to search for evidence of unparticles. According to scale invariance, a distribution containing unparticles would become apparent because it would resemble a distribution for a fractional number of massless particles. This scale invariant sector would interact very weakly with the rest of the Standard Model, making it possible to observe evidence for unparticle stuff, if it exists. The unparticle theory is a high-energy theory that contains both Standard Model fields and Banks‚ÄìZaks fields, which have scale-invariant behavior at an infrared point. The two fields can interact through the interactions of ordinary particles if the energy of the interaction is sufficiently high. These particle interactions would appear to have \\"missing\\" energy and momentum that would not be detected by the experimental apparatus. Certain distinct distributions of missing energy would signify the production of unparticle stuff. If such signatures are not observed, bounds on the model can be set and refined. Experimental indications Unparticle physics has been proposed as an explanation for anomalies in superconducting cuprate materials,James P. F. LeBlanc, Adolfo G. Grushin, Arxiv preprint: Unparticle mediated superconductivity; see Arxiv blog, ‚ÄòUnparticles‚Äô May Hold The Key To Superconductivity, Say Physicists (accessed 8 August 2014) where the charge measured by ARPES appears to exceed predictions from Luttinger's theorem for the quantity of electrons.

The film stars Ramon Novarro and Jeanette MacDonald in her MGM debut. Plot In this film based on the Broadway musical, Victor Florescu (Ramon Novarro) is a composer desperately trying to get his operetta to opening night. First his leading lady (Vivienne Segal) leaves, taking the bulk of their budget with her. Then the male lead splits, leaving Victor to fill his role.

In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career. In 1960, the movie and the title character were the inspiration for recent high school graduate Roberta Lee Streeter to sing under the name Bobbie Gentry. Plot Ruby Corey, a poor backwoods girl living in the small North Carolina town of Braddock, is still in love with Boake Tackman. During high school, Ruby had rebuffed his aggressive advances, and was taken in for a couple of years by a kind wealthy businessman and his wife, who protected her and taught her the skills a lady would need. She moved back home when her father needed her help. Boake's family used to be wealthy, but after generations of profligacy all he has left is the land he has had drained and farmed. He starts a relationship with her but plans to marry a local woman with a rich family. When she hears the news, Ruby marries her former benefactor, Mr. Jim Gentry, whose invalid wife had recently died, despite not loving him. Her background keeps her from being accepted by most of Jim's peers, most of whom decline to attend their after-wedding party. While at another party, Jim gets into a fistfight with Boake after witnessing him dancing with Ruby. Jim calls Ruby a tramp who looks like a lady but doesn't behave like one. She leaves in tears, and later that night, he apologizes. The next day Jim and Ruby go sailing, where he tells her he \\"doesn't mind being second best\\" and she admits she really does love him. A loose rope results in Jim being knocked overboard by the boom, leaving Ruby widowed and distraught. The local paper writes that she is a gold-digger who murdered Jim for his fortune and mentions the fistfight between Jim and Boake. Jim's friends renounce her and she receives accusatory phone calls and harassment from the townspeople. Ruby uses Jim's money to begin a campaign against everyone who slighted her, calling in debts to close down people's businesses as well as the newspaper that slandered her. Her brother comes to beg her for leniency, but she throws him out, warning she is just getting started. When Boake visits, she gives him the promissary-note he had signed and which was acquired by Gentry, and offers to run off with him, but he rejects her, saying that for all her money she can't buy her way out of the swamp, and she can't buy him. Ruby has Boake's land flooded, ruining the crops. After seeing her fury, he goes back to her. Boake and Ruby go to her father's annual duck-hunting party where she goes back to her country roots and Boake drinks away his resentment before visiting her room late at night. While hunting the next day, Boake turns on Ruby in retaliation for her actions but she apologizes. Just then, her estranged brother Jewel Corey begins to shoot at the couple while quoting Bible verses about the wickedness of women and sinners who must be struck down. They try to hide in the swamp but Jewel shoots Boake in the abdomen, killing him; Ruby goes after Jewel and guns him down. Cradling Boake in her arms, Ruby laments her decisions. Ruby later becomes the skipper of a fishing boat, forever looked down upon by the townspeople. CastTheme song The film's theme song, \\"Ruby\\", was composed by Heinz Eric Roemheld.

He was among six generals killed or mortally wounded at the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. Early life George B. Anderson, the oldest son of planter William E. Anderson and his wife Frances Eliza Burgwyn, was born near Hillsboro, North Carolina. Anderson was the second cousin of Col. Henry K. Burgwyn of the 26th North Carolina. He entered the Caldwell Institute, where he graduated at the top of his class. While attending the University of North Carolina, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy and graduated tenth of forty-three cadets in the Class of 1852.Warner, Ezra J., Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders, Louisiana State University Press, 1959, . pp. 5-6.Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, Stanford University Press, 2001, . He was brevetted as a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons and trained at the cavalry school at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. Anderson was promoted to second lieutenant on March 21, 1854. Military career and marriage Following his training, Anderson was sent to California to assist in the survey of a proposed railroad route before joining his regiment at Fort Chadbourne in Texas. On December 13, 1855, he was promoted to first lieutenant. He commanded his cavalry troop in the march from Texas across the plains to Fort Riley, Kansas. In 1858, he was the adjutant of the regiment while serving in the Utah Territory during the Utah War and promoted to Captain.Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862. New York: D. Appleton & Company, 1863. p. 678. In 1859, he was ordered to Louisville, Kentucky, for duty as a recruiting officer. There, he met and married Mildred Ewing. He also served another stint as Adjutant from August 1858 to September 1859. Civil War service With the outbreak of the Civil War, Anderson resigned his U.S. Army commission on April 25, 1861 and returned home. The Governor of North Carolina, John Willis Ellis, appointed him as colonel of the 4th North Carolina Infantry on July 16. Anderson commanded the Confederate garrison at Manassas, Virginia from October 14, 1861 to March 25, 1862.Sifakis, Stewart. Who Was Who in the Civil War. New York: Facts On File, 1988. . p. 9. Anderson capably led his regiment at the Battle of Williamsburg in May 1862 and was rewarded a month later with a promotion to brigadier general on June 9. He was assigned command of a brigade in Major General D.H. Hill's division. In the Seven Days Battles, Anderson led his brigade at Gaines Mill. During the Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1, Anderson commanded both his own brigade and Brig. Gen Winfield Featherston's brigade of James Longstreet's division, as Featherston had been wounded the previous day at Glendale and his brigade's officer corps, having been decimated in the fighting, contained only inexperienced majors and captains. Anderson himself was wounded at Malvern Hill and command of his brigade fell to Col. Charles Tew of the 2nd North Carolina. While recovering, he was part of the defenses around Richmond, Virginia in July 1862, serving in the 4th Brigade of Major General G.W. Smith's Division. Maryland Campaign and death Now able to return to active duty, Anderson resumed his brigade command in time for the Maryland Campaign. He fought at the Battle of South Mountain before marching into the Cumberland Valley to Sharpsburg, Maryland, as the Army of Northern Virginia concentrated. During the subsequent Battle of Antietam, Anderson's veteran North Carolinians defended a portion of the Sunken Road (known as \\"Bloody Lane\\") against repeated Union attacks. A Mini√© ball struck Anderson near his ankle, injuring it badly. Anderson was transported to Shepherdstown and then by wagon up the Shenandoah Valley to Staunton, Virginia, to recuperate. He was eventually shipped by train to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he died following surgery to amputate the infected foot. Anderson is buried in Historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh.

Re-use Long after the railway had closed (the last trains ran in September 1968), the station's booking office and waiting shelter remained extant. However, in 1991 the building was removed, refurbished and now resides at the operational station of Colby on the south line. Today Upon removal the original shelter was replaced by a modern version in 1989, which itself has since been removed.

It was used for temporary exhibitions, and in winter, housed an ice skating rink. Construction The building was designed by Montreal architect John William Hopkins. It had an iron framework, a tinned barrel-vaulted nave and two galleries, each twenty feet wide, extending all the way around the interior. Its design was inspired by The Crystal Palace in London. Its main facades were of iron and glass. Its side walls were of white brick with rose-coloured contrast, with the iron and wood elements painted to match the brick. Its bays were subdivided by three arches, with only the centre arch glazed. Constructed in 20-foot modules, the Crystal Palace was intended to be 180 x 200 feet, but was constructed with shorter transepts, reducing its dimensions to 180 x 120 feet. 1860 Industrial Exhibition The Industrial Exhibition displayed agricultural and industrial products from the then British North America. The displays ranged from minerals, native woods, seeds and grains, preserved birds and fish, oils and foodstuffs to textiles and leather goods, furniture, clothing, machinery, iron work, tools and crafts. As part of the exhibition the Art Association of Montreal, the future Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, organized a display of Canadian art. The Prince of Wales visited Montreal that year and officially opened the exhibition. Skating rink The large open space of the exhibition hall was suitable for other uses. In later years, the hall would house a natural ice skating rink in the winter, and was one of the first indoor skating rinks in Canada. The skating rink was used by McGill University students to play ice hockey and the rink is the site of the first known photograph of ice hockey players in hockey uniforms, taken in 1881. The rink also housed the Crystal Skating Club and Crystal Hockey Club, more commonly known as the Montreal Crystals which played men's senior-level amateur hockey in the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada. Relocation and fire In 1878 it was dismantled and moved to Fletcher's Field, part of which is now known as Jeanne-Mance Park. In July 1896, the Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire, as London's original Crystal Palace would be..Gazette article, \\"Flames devoured one of the city's most glittering landmarks\\" The site of the Crystal Palace, between Mont-Royal Avenue and Saint-Joseph Boulevard, was developed for housing a few years after the fire.

It was part of the island's first railway line and the first official stopping place. Early origins The station was established as the first official stopping place for trains on the line when it opened in 1873. The village at that time was an important trading point previously served only by horse and cart from the capital of Douglas. It was the arrival of the railway that saw the small hamlet expand over several years to become a larger village. Layout & plan from 1905-1907 it boasted a long winding full-height platform on the \\"up\\" side serviced trains westward bound; originally fitted with minimal passenger facilities, including a diminutive timber sentry box for the pointsman at the easterly end, it was later fitted with a long passing loop for trains and a variety of cattle pens and sidings, feeding off the westward platform, though in an easterly direction. Being a largely exposed area when established, the planting of a variety of plants (notably rhododendrons) in the earliest years of the railway meant that it was a largely shaded area. It lies beneath the main road and was accessed via a set of steps, to a wooden station building and platform area. The station closed in 1961 but was reopened in 1967 and was finally closed with the railway in 1968.Passengers No More by G.Daniels and L.Dench Station buildings The timber station building here was the only one of its kind on the railway and was erected in 1892 at the westerly end of the station close to the entrance. It had a sloping roof with passenger shelter and basic staff facilities. It fell out of use after the second world war when the next station at Crosby was favoured for the passing of services, although remained in periodic use until the closure of the railway. It was demolished in 1977 by Prisoners from the IOM Prison. Between 1974 and 1976 the rails and sleepers were lifted from the site, leaving only the platform in situ. A wooden sentry box protected the station's easterly end in the earliest years of the railway. Station gardens The station gardens were well-known locally for their beautiful displays that were tended by the station master and his staff. The station was often awarded the prize for best-kept station on the entire network and was featured in many popular picture postcards of the era. Railway accidents In 1925 a Douglas-bound train failed to collect the guard/brakesman upon setting off from Union Mills resulting the train, hauled by No. 3 Pender of 1873, having insufficient braking capability upon arrival at the terminus; it crashed through the buffer stops at Douglas and the fireman was killed. This was the most notable accident in the railway's history. Long-term station master, 82 year old George Hogg, was killed at the station when he fell between two carriages as a train pulled away from the station on the 14th of July 1947. In 1967 it was the site of a head-on collision between two trains, this largely being put down to the inexperience of the new operator of the railway, Lord Ailsa; locomotives No. 10 G.H. Wood and No. 5 Mona were damaged by the incident, No. 10 receiving buckled main frames.Isle of Man Daily Times, Tuesday, July 05, 1960; Page: 4 Locale & area Railway Inn, 2003 On the northerly side of the station runs the River Dhoo and the station had a long passing loop and at one time a goods siding. When the railway closed the station building was demolished and the tracks lifted but the platform remains in place, as do the words of the station name, picked out in white spar stones along the edge of what was the down line, and a Legs of Mann in the embankment at the exit to the station. At the top of the station steps lay the Railway Inn which remains open today. When the railway arrived it had been called The Grapes but it was soon changed to the Railway Inn, a title it retains today, being a popular vantage point for viewing the T.T. races. The village's general store (now a Spar shop) was at one time run by the Bee Gees mother, a blue plaques on the wall denotes this, installed in 2001. Close to the station site there is a Methodist church and within walking distance are two campsites, one at Glenlough Farm and also at Union Mills Football Club which today is close to the new Nobles Hospital, having relocated from the village in 1999. Filming usage In 1946 the opening scenes of the film I See a Dark Stranger were filmed in and around the station which doubled for a station in Ireland; the scene saw one of the lead characters boarding a train here, being double-headed by locomotives No. 12 Hutchinson and No. 13 Kissack, both of which survive in service today. Other locations on the island were also used for filming. Other notable filming that took place here includes the work of renowned railway photographer Ivo Peters who visited the island to record its transport networks in 1961,1963,1968. Church services For many years an open air church service took place at the nearby Braddan Church, which was served by its own Sundays-only request stop. Heavy trains from Douglas served these enormously popular religious ceremonies until the final years of the railway, and trains would drop off their passengers at Kirk Braddan before carrying on to Union Mills so that locomotives could re-position to the opposite end of their trains before drawing forward to collect returning passengers. With twelve coach trains not unheard of for these services, this is one of the reasons the passing loop at the station is so long. The practice of dedicated church trains was still carried out until the summer of 1968 which proved to be the Peel Line's final year of operation. Rail Trail In 1990 the Douglas-Peel trackbed was designated as the Rail Trail and much work undertaken to improve the station underfoot. It was at this time that the breakdown crane belonging to the railway was placed on permanent display at the station, and a section of track installed for it to sit on; the crane had been built by the Birmingham-based company of Richard C. Gibbins and delivered new to the railway in 1893, being stored at various locations prior to its removal to Union Mills in 1991 where it still remains today.

Actor Justus D. Barnes, in The Great Train Robbery A threat is a communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another person. Intimidation is widely observed in animal behavior (particularly in a ritualized form) chiefly in order to avoid the unnecessary physical violence that can lead to physical damage or the death of both conflicting parties. A threat is considered an act of coercion. Some of the more common types of threats forbidden by law are those made with an intent to obtain a monetary advantage or to compel a person to act against his or her will. In most US states, it is an offense to threaten to (1) use a deadly weapon on another person; (2) injure another's person or property; or (3) injure another's reputation. Law=Brazil In Brazil, the crime of threatening someone, defined as a threat to cause unjust and grave harm, is punishable by a fine or three months to one year in prison, as described in the Brazilian Penal Code, article 147. Brazilian jurisprudence does not treat as a crime a threat that was proffered in a heated discussion. Germany The German Strafgesetzbuch ¬ß 241 punishes the crime of threat with a prison term for up to one year or a fine. Even if someone, against his better judgment, feigns to another person that the realization of a serious criminal offense directed against him or a person close to him is imminent, shall be similarly punished. United States In the United States, federal law criminalizes certain true threats transmitted via the U.S. mail or in interstate commerce. It also criminalizes threatening the government officials of the United States. Some U.S. states criminalize cyberbullying. Threats of bodily harm are called assault.' =State of Texas= In the state of Texas, it is not necessary that the person threatened actually perceive a threat for a threat to exist for legal purposes. Olivias v. State of Texas, 203 S.W. 3d 341 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) Citing McGowan v. State of Texas, 664 S.W. 2d 355 at 357 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984). https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal- appeals/2006/pd-1936-04-7.html 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law ¬ß16.3(b) at 568 (2d ed. 2003).  True threat  A true threat is a threatening communication that can be prosecuted under the law. It is distinct from a threat that is made in jest. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that true threats are not protected under the U.S. Constitution based on three justifications: preventing fear, preventing the disruption that follows from that fear, and diminishing the likelihood that the threatened violence will occur. There is some concern that even satirical speech could be regarded as a \\"true threat\\" due to concern over terrorism. The true threat doctrine was established in the 1969 Supreme Court case Watts v. United States. In that case, an eighteen-year-old male was convicted in a Washington, D.C. District Court for violating a statute prohibiting persons from knowingly and willfully making threats to harm or kill the President of the United States. The conviction was based on a statement made by Watts, in which he said, \\"[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.\\" Watts appealed, leading to the Supreme Court finding the statute constitutional on its face, but reversing the conviction of Watts. In reviewing the lower court's analysis of the case, the Court noted that \\"a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.\\" The Court recognized that \\"uninhibited, robust, and wideopen\\" political debate can at times be characterized by \\"vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\\" In light of the context of Watts' statement - and the laughter that it received from the crowd - the Court found that it was more \\"a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President\\" than a \\"true threat.\\" In so holding, the Court established that there is a \\"true threat\\" exception to protected speech, but also that the statement must be viewed in its context and distinguished from protected hyperbole. The opinion, however, stopped short of defining precisely what constituted a \\"true threat.\\" See alsoReferences Category:Bullying Category:Crimes Category:Psychological abuse Category:Psychological manipulation ","title":"Threat"},{"id":"13341894","text":"is a semi-retired Japanese professional wrestler, known by her ringname , who competed in All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling as one of the leading female wrestlers during the 1980s. The longtime leader of the stable Gokuaku Domei‚Äîwhich included Crane Yu, Condor Saito and Bull Nakano‚Äîshe was one of the main rivals of the popular tag team Crush Gals. Their long running feud would become extremely popular in Japan during the 1980s, with their televised matches resulting in some of the highest rated in Japanese television as well as the promotion regularly selling out arenas. Professional wrestling career=All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (1980-1986) Making her debut in 1980, within three years she defeated Lioness Asuka for the AJW Championship on January 8 and held the title for almost six months before losing the title back to Asuka on June 1, 1983. During her feud with the Crush Gals, she would often team with Bull Nakano and Crane Yu, who Matsumoto teamed with to defeat Lioness Asuka and Chigusa Nagayo for the WWWA Tag Team title on February 25, 1985 although the two were forced to vacate the title two months later following Yu's retirement. She later made an unsuccessful bid for the vacant WWWA World Single Championship losing to Devil Masami on December 12, 1985. She later lost to rival Chigusa Nagayo for the All Pacific Championship in Tokyo, Japan on April 5, 1986. World Wrestling Federation (1986) In early 1986, she and Nakano made a brief appearance in the World Wrestling Federation as The Devils of Japan, wrestling Velvet McIntyre in two separate tag team matches with Dawn Marie in Boston, Massachusetts on March 8, which they lost and with Linda Gonzales in New York City, New York on March 16, 1986, which they were victorious. Return to AJW (1986-1988) Once back in Japan, Matsumoto resumed her feud with the Crush Gals teaming with Bull Nakano to defeat Lioness Asuka and Kazue Nagahori (substituting for an injured Chigusa Nagayo) for the WWWA Tag Team title on August 23, 1986 however the two would eventually be forced to vacate the title the following year. Although Matsumoto officially announced her retirement on February 25, 1988 in which she wrestled the Crush Gals in a tag team match with Yukari Ohmori and then siding against her partner by switching with Nagayo against Asuka and Ohmori, she wrestled her final match against Bull Nakano and Condor Saito on February 28. Occasional appearances (1998-present) She has since appeared on several All Japan Women \\"legends reunions\\", and in August 1998, Matsumoto and Crane Yu came out of retirement wrestling in a ten-minute exhibition tag team match against Combat Toyoda and Hyper Cat. She also made several appearances for the now defunct GAEA promotion, and as recently as November 11, 2007, ran her own show under the banner of Gokuaku Domei Produce at Shinjuku FACE. Other media Matsumoto lent her ring name and likeness to the Sega arcade game Gokuaku Doumei Dump Matsumoto, which was released in some Western countries under the title Body Slam. The game was later ported to the Sega Master System, but Western localized versions (renamed simply Pro Wrestling) removed her likeness and replaced the entirely female cast with male wrestlers. Since her retirement from professional wrestling, she has appeared in a number of Japanese films during the late 1980s and early 1990s most notably portraying the character B√°i Y√°-Sh√†n in Ryoichi Ikegami and Kazuo Koike's Crying Freeman series which includes Crying Freeman 2: Shades of Death, Part 1 (1989), Crying Freeman 3: Shades of Death, Part 2 (1990) and Crying Freeman 5: Abduction in Chinatown (1992). She has also starred in Scorpion Woman Prisoner: Death Threat (1991) and Okoge (1992).

It was part of the island's first railway line. Description This station boasted its own cattle dock, siding and station building, the latter of which was made to the same design as the station building at St John's. The station last operated in 1968. At the eastern end of the station, beyond the points of the passing loop, the line crossed the road to Ellerslie Depot and the stone crossing hut is all that survives of the railway infrastructure today. Closure When the line closed, a group of lads from Merseyside removed the station nameboard and to this day it is believed to hang on the wall of the scout headquarters in the Liverpool suburb that shares its name. Environs The site of the former station is now on the perimeter of the local playing fields at the bottom of a valley that shortly thereafter climbs steeply to the old school house, now a languages centre. The local Methodist chapel is located on the same road and since the line's closure a cricket pavilion and meeting rooms have been erected nearby. The public toilets for the village and war memorial also stand at the end of the road, which adjoins the world-famous T.T. course at its end.

He has also acted in several films, using the stage name Luther Wilson. Career=Early career During the mid-1990s, Biggs competed in the Memphis-based United States Wrestling Association (USWA) as part of the stable the Country Boys along with Billy Joe Travis and Doomsday. Although he had appeared in WCW several years before as \\"Big Sexy\\" Luther Biggs losing a match to Ice Train on WCW Saturday Night on December 14 and WCW Pro on December 29, 1996, he was later introduced by wrestler turned manager Coach Buzz Stern (who had previously wrestled as Glacier) as his new \\"protege\\" during WCW Thunder selecting him as part of his \\"Winners Club\\" on September 2, 1999. After appearing in subsequent vignettes as a somewhat clumsy varsity wrestler training with Stern, he made his debut on WCW Thunder losing to Bobby Eaton on September 30. After losing to Eaton, Stern attacked Eaton applying a full nelson hold on Eaton and then applying the hold on Biggs. Regularly appearing on WCW Thunder and WCW Worldwide, while he continued to lose to mid- card wrestlers such as Meng, he also had some success while on WCW Worldwide and WCW Saturday Night against the Blacktop Bully on October 23 although his victory was due only to his manager's interference. He was released along with Stern and many other WCW wrestlers at the end of 1999. Return to the independent circuit In 2001, he appeared in NWA Wildside defeating his old manager Coach Buzz Stern on March 17. The following night, he appeared at ringside with \\"Big\\" Ron Studd in a handicap match against Damien Steele and The Underdoggs and later defeated Romeo Bliss during the event. He also began wrestling for Dusty Rhodes's Florida-based Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling as \\"Lethal\\" Luther Biggs losing to Bobby Hayes and, later that night, appeared in a tag team match with Larry Zbyszko against Dusty Rhodes and New Jack in Carrollton, Georgia on June 30. Defeating Sean Evans in Woodstock, Georgia on December 7, he later lost to Jorge Estrada on December 28. He defeated Steve Madison on December 29 and Jason Sugarman on January 26, 2002. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling In 2003, Biggs resurfaced in NWA: Total Nonstop Action as Disgraceland who was introduced by Glen Gilberti as the newest member of the stable Sports Entertainment Xtreme after his debut defeating Shark Boy in Nashville, Tennessee on February 23, 2003. Following the match, Jorge Estrada of The Flying Elvises confronted Biggs over his Elvis impersonator gimmick and was attacked by Biggs, Gilberti and Mike Sanders who later dragged Estrada backstage to the S.E.X. dressing room and flushed his head in a toilet. Two weeks later, he would lose to Estrada after Gilberti and Sanders left ringside on March 5, 2003. He also teamed with Ron Reis to defeat Gilligan and Scotty Beach at the Rock N' Shock Benefit Show on September 16, 2006.

It was part of the island's first railway line. Construction The station was built by the Isle of Man Railway and opened on 1 July 1873. The station was located at the end of the railway line from Douglas via St John's to the town of Peel. The decision to locate the station by the harbour was taken late in 1872 when the Isle of Man Railway abandoned plans to extend the line to Ramsey. The station building was located next to Peel harbour. A small goods depot was situated next to the platforms, on the side farthest from the harbour. Services Most trains from Douglas to Peel were combined with trains to Ramsey. The two sections split at St John's. The IoMR timetable for July 1922 shows twelve trains arriving at Peel from Douglas on weekdays. Nine were 'split trains', whilst three were complete trains from Douglas. The first arrival was at 8:58am and the last was at 11:40pm. The average time taken for the 12 miles from Douglas was 40 minutes. Regular trains ran to and from Douglas until the line was closed on 13 November 1965. Services resumed on 3 June 1967, but ceased permanently on 7 September 1968. The reopening day of the line in 1967 saw the celebrations centred on this station and nearly all the railway's serviceable rolling stock was on site together with five steam locomotives on the day, and a fair held on the station forecourt to mark the event. The last time a locomotive was on the site was in 1998 as part of the Steam 125 celebrations marking the anniversary of the line's opening when locomotive No. 1 Sutherland was operated on a short section of temporary track in the car park which was once the island platform. At various times there have been plans to create short sections of track from the station but none of these have ever come to fruition, though the Manx Transport Museum Group have their headquarters in the nearby former brickworks office, holding a number of railway-related items. After closure Replica of a Viking boat After the final trains departed in 1968 the station remained in situ for a number of years. The rails were lifted in 1975, and then the site was surfaced and used as a boat park; the main station building also became a fisherman's shelter and the goods shed was converted in 1979 to house the replica Viking longboat Odin's Raven which was constructed in Norway and sailed to the island to commemorate the millennium of the island's own parliament in that year. The locomotive shed at the eastern end of the yard was demolished at the same time as the rails were lifted, having become unsafe following a fire that engulfed the wooden lean-to some years previously, although the water tower beside it has survived and now forms part of a visitor's centre operated by the local heritage trust. This site also now houses one of the railway's original 1873 carriages, which has recently been cosmetically restored. The site remained in this format until 1998, when the award-winning visitor's centre was developed on the site. Next to the station is the Creek Inn, once called the Station Hotel; today it is a popular venue for live traditional music, and also features displays of old photographs and posters of the time the railway served the city. Today right The building that now forms a display area for the House of Mannanan in Peel was originally the terminus of the Isle of Man Railway It was used as a fishermens' shelter after the line closed. The building replaced the wooden original built for the opening in 1873. It was built in 1911 partly from distinctive local sandstone. In a picturesque harbourside setting, the station was a busy one. Lifted after closure in 1968, it is the most \\"intact\\" of the line's closed stations, with the station itself, water tower (now part of a transport museum) and goods shed still extant. The goods shed became home of the replica Viking longship \\"Odin's Raven\\" in 1979, but now houses an audio-visual display area as part of the museum. At the eastern end of the station next to the water tower was once the locomotive shed, long since gone, but an original four-wheel coach body is now on site as a potential restoration project for the museum group. The quayside on which the site sits has been considerably redeveloped in the last few years: many nearby buildings have been overhauled and repainted in period style; the area is having something of a renaissance as a popular destination with trippers and holidaymakers. The River Neb, next to the station site, has also had a marina facility installed. A contemporary designed toilet and shower block has also been installed on reclaimed land close to the former locomotive shed for use in connection with the vessels housed at the marina. Denoting the position of the former railway line, a replica fishtail semaphore signal stands at the end of the station yard, together with a small set of replica level crossing gates.

Early life and education Ghanem was born in the Tohwita suburb of Beirut on 10 August 1943. He attended the Coll√®ge Notre Dame in Furn el Chebek and the Coll√®ge du Sacr√©-C≈ìur in Gemmayzeh, both private Catholic schools. After earning a degree in law from the Universit√© Saint-Joseph in Beirut and the University of Lyon, he taught law for several years at the Lebanese University. He joined the Kataeb Party in 1961 and later became head of its Baabda District. Political career In 2000, Ghanem was elected to the Lebanese Parliament for Baabda constituency, running on the list of Druze leader Walid Jumblat. A member of the block of the \\"democratic meeting\\" Qornet Chehwan Gathering, he enjoyed nevertheless a certain autonomy considering his membership of the Kataeb Party. He supported Amine Gemayel in the political struggle within the Kataeb Party, countered the pro-Syrian president of the party Karim Pakradouni and posted himself as an important speaker within the reforming Movement of the Kataeb Party directed by Gemayel. In September 2004, he voted against the extension of President √âmile Lahoud's term. He actively participated in the Cedar Revolution after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. He was re-elected in 2005 to his post of deputy and seat to the political council of the Kataeb Party, after the reunification of this party and the reconciliation between Gemayel and Pakradouni. Assassination Ghanem returned to Beirut from Abu Dhabi on 16 September 2007, just two days before the assassination. Like many other anti-Syrian legislators, he used to travel abroad during the summer months due to safety concerns. According to reports, nearly forty 14 March MPs including him traveled abroad after the assassination of Walid Eido and returned to Lebanon two days before the assassination. Ghanem and the other MPs stayed at the Phoenicia InterContinental Hotel under heavy security after their return. The car-bomb that killed him along with at least six others, including his two bodyguards, one of whom is Antoine Daou, exploded at a junction of a main street filled with rush hour traffic in the densely populated and mostly Christian neighborhood of Horsh Tabet in Sin el Fil. The bomb was reported to be booby-trapped. Ghanem was at the age of 64.

The sources revealed that the killers left Lebanon immediately after the assassination, completely disguised as Syrian workers. Burial Ghanem's body was buried in the Beirut suburb of Tohwita.

It served the area known as Poortown in the Isle of Man and was an intermediate stopping place on a line that ran between St. John's and Ramsey. Origins The station opened as Poortown in and served the hamlet of the same name on the outskirts of the westerly town of Peel. It was the closest station on the Manx Northern Railway to the city and prior to its establishment the company considered either a spur or terminus station there, ultimately selecting a route to St. John's which connected with the Peel Line of the Isle of Man Railway Company. The station was a request stop and appeared erratically on the company's timetable literature throughout its early years. Buildings The facilities here consisted of a simple wooden station building with corrugated iron roof which sat next to short raised platform. This was later accompanied by a grounded van body which was used as a permanent way store. The station was renamed Peel Road in 1885 to reflect the fact that it was the railway's station closest to Peel, although it is also thought that the original title was derisory to the local inhabitants and the railway had received a number of requests to re- title the station. At one time there was a sharply curving siding off the running line which facilitated the collection of stone from the nearby quarry, but the opening and closure dates are unknown. Closure The station was officially closed in and removed from all timetable literature after this point. Trains did however still stop at the station upon request. Despite remaining open until this time, it became an unstaffed halt as early as 1937. It was still in evidence during the final season of operation in 1968 but its remote location in comparison to the locale from which it took its name ensured that it was very little used in later years. Today Other than the vague outline of the old platform in the undergrowth and the bridge that carries the Poortown Road over the railway line at its northern end, there is little to remind us of the station here today. The buildings which were derelict when the railway closed in 1968 were demolished in 1975 at the same time as the rails were lifted. It forms part of a public footpath and may still be accessed by a sloping driveway above.

Origins Kirk Michael was about halfway between Ramsey and St. John's, and was planned as a passing place for trains when the line was first surveyed in 1877. Kirk Michael was the largest village between the two termini, and the MNR intended it to be a main intermediate station. The station was opened on . Buildings=Station Building The station was provided with quite substantial sandstone, slate roofed buildings, consisting of station master's office and waiting room. The main station building was constructed, like other stations on this line, in local red sandstone, in a style to those elsewhere on the route; a similar one still also remains at St. Germain's. Goods shed A small goods shed was provided upon opening; it was later rebuilt. The new building remains on site today; it is stone-built by the Isle of Man Railway in 1923 in improve capacity, owing to an increase in freight traffic. It is not in the distinctive red sandstone of the station and has a more utilitarian appearance. Water tower There was a water tank at the southern end of the station, which was used by locomotives travelling in either direction, though more the engines of southbound trains would uncouple from the train to take water here, in order to not block the level crossing. The long run from Ramsey with longer trains sometimes required a watering stop en route. The tower was a simple brick-built construction and was demolished in 1975 at the same time as the rails and sleepers through the station were lifted. Locale Church Lychgate The station was near the centre of Kirk Michael, on a minor road leading to the coast. At the top of Station Road the follows spreads out; nearby were a branch of the Isle of Man Bank (closed in 2014 after over 100 years of service), the Mitre Hotel, the local primary school, village stores, local blacksmith, village butchers and the imposing Kirk Michael church with its oak-carved lychgate. The main road through the village forms part of the famous TT mountain circuit. After the railway closed, a steam centre was established not far from the station and this became home to a number of related items, most notably the locomotive Sea Lion from the Groudle Glen Railway. This facility was occasionally open to the public, but closed in 1984; much of the exhibits were relocated both on and off island. Several of them may be found today at the Jurby Transport Museum forming part of the John Walton Collection. Naming Approaching The village is named for the church, a prominent landmark. Much of the Isle of Man Railway's marketing gave the station name as either ‚ÄôMichael or simply Michael, the apostrophe one assumes acknowledging the \\"Kirk\\" prefix, but in later times the station was given its full title. On much of the railway's marketing and advertising material the single name title is given consistently; however the distinctive station running in boards always showed the name in full, as did all tickets issued to/from the station until the closure (it remained as a manned station for the passing of trains until the final year of service). The station was also marketed heavily in conjunction with Glen Wyllin, which later became a railway-owned and operated concern (see below). The station had several signs advising passengers to alight here for the pleasure grounds. Glen Wyllin Ex-County Donegal Diesel Railcars Crossing Glen Wyllin Viaduct In addition to the village, the station also served the nearby Glen Wyllin Pleasure Grounds, an area in a nearby valley which was developed in the 1890s as a private undertaking upon the arrival of the railway. This was once one of the most popular and profitable tourist destinations on the island. The line passed over the wide valley by means of a lattice girder bridge which was replaced in 1922 by a plate girder construction. The glen runs down to the sea where there is a long partly sandy beach that stretches along the island's north-western coast. The glen itself was later purchased and further developed by the Isle of Man Railway to include a boating lake, pedalos, swings slides and other children's attractions; the glen is fondly remembered by generations of local children whose annual Sunday School outing was often a trip on the train to visit the glen. Between the station and the glen there was a pathway parallel to the running line giving access to the park. Today the glen is popular with campers and has its own shop and showering facilities though the attractions have long since disappeared. The distinctive viaduct was demolished in 1975, but the stone-built stanchions remain today as a lasting reminder of the railway's popularity and development of the glen. Today A set of mock-up level crossing gates have been installed to show the site of the railway, and sections of rail remain in the macadam of the road. The pathway to Glen Wyllin remains, but the water tower was demolished in 1975 when the rails were lifted. The station site forms part of a heritage \\"Rail Trail\\"; it follows the former railway line and was established along all former trackbeds between Douglas, Peel and Ramsey in 1993, which was designated as the \\"Year Of Railways\\" on the island. Fire Station The station buildings still survive today and now house the local fire brigade offices; the goods shed has been converted to house the fire engine. This has been in place since 1981, although some modifications have been made to the structures, notably adoption of the goods shed doors to accommodate the fire engine; but the station building retains its unique appearance.

Starting broadcasts on 103.1 MHz FM in September 2007, it aims to provide dedicated programming to the Asian Muslim population that live in Pendle, east Lancashire, during times of Muslim holy festivals. As common with many of the UK's new community radio stations, it will also have a wider remit to promote wider \\"social gain\\", for all local communities, through on-air access via voluntary opportunities. The station also aims to help with community cohesion and integration, economic regeneration and development and political wellbeing. History Pendle Community Radio stems from several short term Restricted Service Licence broadcasts, dating back to 1999, that were awarded by Ofcom and its predecessor, The Radio Authority. These RSL broadcasts usually ran twice a year, each for 28 days, to coincide with Eid ul-Fitr (Ramadhan) and Milad un Nabi. Hence the name of the radio station changed between Radio Ramadhan or Milaad FM, to coincide. Following the success of the RSL broadcasts and the fact that there wasn't another local radio station with any significant special interest programmes aimed at the local community, Ofcom awarded a full-time 5 year community radio licence in 2006 to the same group that ran the RSLs. The radio station is based at 15 Cross Street Nelson and named as AWAZ RADIO 103.1 FM (Pendle Community Radio). The team is led by professionals. Current Directors Sagheer Akhtar and Shahid Kaleem have clearly outlined the aims and objectives for the coming years. The team includes technical professionals and volunteers. Great team includes Adnan Sohail, Tasawer Ali, Ismail, sisters, brothers, presenters and guests. Pendle Community Radio has a weekly programme on behalf of the Burnley Pendle and Rossendale Council for Voluntary Service which gives representatives of local voluntary, faith and community sector organisations the chance of much- needed publicity. Funding Ofcom stipulates that any community radio station that is situated within the area of a commercial radio station (with a served population of 50000-150000), must obtain at least 50% of revenues from donations and grants. A maximum of 50% can be derived from the sale of advertising and sponsorship. Any community radio station must also be run as not-for-profit.Ofcom Community Radio As such many community radio stations focus on using volunteers in many operational areas Pendle Community Radio aims to find suitable grant funding from both the public and private sector.

NIOSH developed the HHE program to comply with a mandate in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to investigate workplace health hazards reported by employers and employees. According to Section 20(a)(6) of the Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized \\"following a written request by any employer or authorized representative of employees, to determine whether any substance normally found in the place of employment has potentially toxic effects in such concentrations as used or found.\\" Occupational Safety and Health Act (Public Law 91-596, 91st Congress, S.2193, December 29, 1970), 29 USC 669 (a)(6). Quoted in Health Hazard Evaluations: By What Authority Does NIOSH Conduct HHEs? National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed May 8, 2009. Employees, employers, and labor unions can request assistance from the HHE program at no cost to them. The HHE program responds to requests through a variety of methods, including telephone consultations and field investigations. For field investigations, NIOSH provides a report detailing the hazards found and outlining remediation recommendations. NIOSH does not have the authority to force the employer to comply with these recommendations.Health Hazard Evaluations. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed May 8, 2009. The report is given to the requestor, the employer, employee representatives, OSHA, and other appropriate agencies; most reports are posted on the NIOSH website. Requests NIOSH recommends requesting an HHE if employees are sick and the cause is unknown or the number of illnesses or injuries is higher than expected in a group of employees. Requests should also be made when employees are exposed to a new hazard or a hazard unregulated by OSHA or when employees are experiencing ill health when their exposure to an agent is below the occupational exposure limits. If multiple hazardous agents or conditions are present in the workplace, an HHE request can be beneficial. Common hazards evaluated include chemicals, particulates, noise, radiation, biological agents, ergonomics, heat stress, and occupational stress. An HHE can be requested by current employee(s) of the workplace, a management official on behalf of the employer, or a labor union representing employees at the workplace. For workplaces with more than three employees, an employee request must be supported by the signatures of three employees. If the workplace has three or fewer employees, only one employee signature is required. The Occupational Safety and Health Act gives NIOSH the authority to conduct HHEs in the private sector and federal workplaces. When the workplace is part of a state or local government, NIOSH authority is more limited and the employer's cooperation may be necessary before NIOSH can do an evaluation. HHE process A video about measuring contaminants on workers' skin and workplace surfaces as part of an HHE investigation A video about medical testing at a workplace as part of an HHE investigation NIOSH typically initially contacts the requestor within 30 days to discuss the request. How the request is addressed largely depends on the nature of the request. In most cases, NIOSH responds with a telephone consultation to discuss the problems and how to correct them. For other requests, NIOSH visits the workplace to learn more about the health hazards present. In a small number of cases, NIOSH refers the request to a more appropriate agency. On-site workplace evaluations are coordinated with the employer; NIOSH does not usually make unannounced visits. At the conclusion of an initial site visit, NIOSH reports its preliminary findings verbally to the employer, employees, and employee representatives (such as labor unions). At this point in the evaluation, the results are mostly incomplete, and in some cases, more visits are necessary. Employees who participate in exposure or health testing will receive their personal tests results if they choose so. After results are completely analyzed, NIOSH compiles a final report. The report contains the official findings of the evaluation and recommendations on how to address health hazards found or to improve programs for protecting employee health. This report is sent to the employer, the employee representative, OSHA, and other agencies. The employer must post this report in the workplace where all employees can view it. Employee protection Federal laws and regulations provide some protection against possible discriminatory actions in the workplace for employees who request an HHE or participate in an evaluation. If an employee requests it, NIOSH will not disclose their name to the employer.\\"What protections are provided for employees who request and participate in HHE investigations?\\" Health Hazard Evaluations Program Information Additionally, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act prohibit employers from punishing employees for reporting a health hazard or participating in NIOSH investigations. Completed reports NIOSH has completed over 3,000 HHE reports detailing on- site workplace evaluations in all 50 states. The reports are available from the NIOSH website or by contacting the HHE program.Health Hazard Evaluations: Search Results. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed May 8, 2009. HHE reports can be searched online.  HHE program impact  The HHE Program conducts ‚Äúfollowback activities‚Äù to learn if evaluated workplaces found the HHE useful, whether employers implemented recommendations, and to determine if workplaces need additional help. Followback activities can include surveys, conference calls, and return visits. Followback data shows the majority of respondents have implemented the HHE program‚Äôs recommendations, think the evaluation improved the health and safety of the workplace, and would request an HHE again.  Comparison to OSHA inspections and the OSHA consultation program  Although OSHA inspectors and HHE program staff have legal authority to enter workplaces, there are important differences between the programs. OSHA is a regulatory agency. OSHA inspections focus on known and regulated hazards, and inspectors can issue citations and fines for noncompliance with safety and health regulations. NIOSH is a research agency. Its evaluations cover known or unrecognized hazards. The HHE program does not issue fines or citations. The OSHA on-site consultation program shares some features with the HHE program. Both programs provide services at no cost to the requestors and assess occupational health and safety issues. Neither program issues citations, fines, or penalties. However, only small or mid-sized business owners can request an OSHA consultation, and owners are required to correct identified hazards. In contrast, employers, employees, and unions from any sized business can request an HHE, and employers are not required to follow HHE program recommendations.  Emergency response activities  The HHE Program provides technical assistance during federal emergencies. Staff are trained to respond to a natural disasters and biological, chemical, explosive, and radiological events. The HHE Program provided protection to emergency response workers in the September 11 attacks, anthrax attacks, Hurricane Katrina, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and the Ebola epidemic.

Now approximately 2,200 inhabitants live there, while the main hotel is under reconstruction. History Big Kemeri swamp national park. The name ƒ∂emeri (Kemmern) first appears in written sources after the founding of the Dukedom of Courland in 1561. Documentary evidence indicates that the springs at ƒ∂emeri first became known for their curative properties in 1796, the first chemical analysis of the spring water being performed in 1818. The residents of the nearby town of Sloka began to build houses for the patients. In 1825, the first public building was built for spa guests. Bad Kemmern was founded as a resort in 1838, when the emperor Nicholas I of Russia gave this land for building the first bath-house with mineral water. From then onwards people started to come here for treatment. The ƒ∂emeri railway station was established in 1877. The ƒ∂emeri resort became popular in the Russian Empire. In 1912, a direct railway link was created between ƒ∂emeri and Moscow. The connection with the beach of Jaunƒ∑emeri was provided by electrical tram. Nerve disease, as well as diseases of joints, bones, and muscles were treated in the resort. Treatment with sulfuring water and mud baths was also carried out. The annual number of people visiting the resort reached 8,300. During World War I, the battles between German and Russian forces lasting several years were only a few miles from ƒ∂emeri. The resort was devastated and the train station was destroyed. The newly created Republic of Latvia tried to restore the previous glory of ƒ∂emeri. In 1924, a special bathing facility was built for mud baths equipped with mechanical hot mud feed and the pumping of used mud back to the bog. In 1929, a 42-m-tall water tower with a sightseeing platform at the top was built near the bathing facility. The most impressive building was Hotel ƒ∂emeri called \\"White Ship\\" with more than 100 rooms designed and built together by famous Latvian architect Ei≈æens Laube and Spa Hotel's chief doctor and its director Dr.Janis Libietis. The hotel was opened to guests in 1936. Dr. Janis Libietis managed the Kemeri complex from 1928‚Äì1944 as he later sought asylum in Sweden. In 1997, ƒ∂emeri National Park was established.

The novel is considered a classic in lesbian fiction, being one of the few hardbound novels with lesbian content to be published in the early 20th century. Quite rare for lesbian fiction in this time, the ending is actually satisfactory for the lesbian characters. It was also reissued in 1953 by Lion Publishers, but titled The Strange Path. It was re-issued once more in 1985 by Naiad Press under its original title. It was Wilhelm's second novel after We Too Are Drifting, both of them containing lesbian themes.

Plot summary  Morgen Teutenberg is an introverted 21-year-old woman nursing her dying father Fritz, who is a painter. She is developing a novel with her father's assistance. Out walking one day, she meets a very handsome young man, Royal St. Gabriel, a pianist who is quite taken with her. Royal pursues her romantically despite Morgen's lack of enthusiasm. Fritz dies very soon after Morgen meets Royal, and she is devastated by his loss and nonplussed by Royal's attention, not seeming to welcome it, but flattered by his gentlemanly manners and thoughtfulness. He buys her a radio and has it delivered to her house with a letter telling her when to tune in to a station. When she does, she hears a composition he has written for her that she imagines describes her perfectly. For five months they have a friendship characterized by Royal's unabashed love for Morgen, and her not sure how to tell him that she is grateful for his friendship, but does not want to pursue anything deeper with him. On Christmas Eve, overwhelmed with missing her father again, she turns to Royal and they sleep together. Royal is overcome with gratitude, not believing she has given herself to him at last, but Morgen does not enjoy the experience and realizes she went to him out of loneliness. She tells him this and he is hurt by it. He travels frequently and leaves her again, unsure of how to reach her. In his absence, she meets new neighbors who have moved into a house nearby. A 16-year-old woman named Toni lives with her aunt. They have known each other before as children and Morgen is thrilled to have Toni back so close by. In sharp contrast to her relationship with Royal, she and Toni find themselves kindred almost immediately. They spend several nights together, and are quite hesitant to leave each other. When Royal returns, he notices something with Morgen is wrong immediately. She tells him, \\"I am two and the other is Toni.\\" He is stunned, but when he accepts it, for the first time she realizes how much she likes him.  Explanation of the novel's title  Soon before Fritz dies, he comments that he will be on his way to Valhalla soon, and he is prepared for it because he is so very happy since Morgen has just finished a very good novel. He tells her that his happiness will serve as his torch in order to arrive there safely. His comment serves as the impetus for her to realize what should make her happy in her life.

He mainly played for Cambridge University and then Worcestershire, but also appeared once each for the Gentlemen and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Human also played minor counties cricket for Berkshire and (once) Oxfordshire. He gained Blues at both cricket and football.Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1943. Human was educated at Repton School, where in 1928 he captained the cricket XI and had considerable success as an all-rounder. By the age of 17, he was playing in the Minor Counties Championship for Berkshire, scoring 64 against Wiltshire at Marlborough College in August 1926. The following year he appeared twice at Lord's: once for Public Schools against the Army, then as captain of Young Amateurs versus Young Professionals, in which match he scored 51 and 2 and took 2‚Äì15, including the wicket of future England Test cricketer Jim Smith. In August 1929, he scored 138 against Devon. Human continued to play for Berkshire until 1934, but meanwhile he had made his first-class debut, for Cambridge against Leicestershire at Fenner's in May 1930; his maiden wicket (and only one in the match) was that of Les Berry. He played several more times for Cambridge that season, hitting 67 and taking 3‚Äì87 in an eventful match in late June against Surrey County Cricket Club: Thomas Shepherd made 234 out of 565 for Surrey, in reply to which Cambridge fell to 284/6 before a seventh-wicket partnership of 257 between Trevil Morgan and Freddie Brown gave the university a seven-run first-innings lead. The game in the end was drawn. He took 4‚Äì42 (his career best) against MCC in early July, and was selected as a late choice for the 1930 Varsity Match immediately thereafter. However, he did very little to contribute toward's his university's victory, his only wicket being that of the Nawab of Pataudi, later to become his team-mate at Worcester. 1931 saw Human turn out 11 times for Cambridge, but his performances tended to be rather disappointing: he passed fifty only once, making 67 against Leicestershire in June, though with the ball he did collect 21 wickets ‚Äî the most he ever managed in a season ‚Äî at a respectable average of 35.52. He was again picked for the Varsity Match, but this time managed no wickets at all. That match marked the end of his first-class cricket for two seasons, though he continued to turn out fairly regularly for Berkshire, and made his only appearance for Oxfordshire against the touring Indians at Christ Church Ground, taking two wickets including that of captain K. S. Limbdi. Human's first-class career resumed in late June 1934, when he made his Worcestershire debut, against his old university, at Worcester, hitting 75 in the first innings. Although most of his matches that summer were still with Berkshire, he did make two further first-class appearances in September. The first of these was for the Gentlemen against the Players at Scarborough, when he appeared with his brother, John; neither sibling had much success. A few days later he scored 51 for MCC against Kent at Folkestone. All his remaining first-class games were for Worcestershire, for whom he continued to play a few times a season up until 1939; he was prevented from turning out more regularly by his position as a master at Bromsgrove School. Although he reached fifty 14 times in first-class cricket, he never made more than the 81 he hit against Essex in 1938. This was one of two occasions on which he captained the county, the other being versus Derbyshire ten days later. By now his bowling had fallen away considerably, and in his entire Worcestershire career he took only ten wickets at more than 60 runs apiece. His last game of all was an innings defeat by Kent at Worcester in August 1939; Human scored 15 and 9, and bowled not one ball. Human was surprisingly chosen for the 1939‚Äì40 tour of India, but this tour never took place owing to the outbreak of the Second World War. He did in fact go to India, but as a soldier with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. Having reached the rank of captain, he died on active service in that country aged just 33. His brother, the aforementioned John, played over 100 first-class matches, mostly for Cambridge, MCC and Middlesex.

She was born in 1907, to a bhadralok Vaidya family of Bikrampur in Dhaka, now in Bangladesh; the family later moved to Calcutta, where she got a Master of Arts degree in history from Bethune College,Distinguished Almunae www.bethunecollege.ac.in. Calcutta University. Nationalist ideas were current among the young people in Calcutta she met at university, and she was filling with a strong desire to take part in the freedom struggle. She tried to quit her studies and enter Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi‚Äôs Sabarmati Ashram, but her parents disapproved. Finishing her education, she became friends with some members of the extremist Jugantar party, and was quickly converted from her original Gandhism to the cult of armed resistance. In 1930 she left home and took a job as manager of a hostel for poor women. There she stored and couriered, bombs and bomb-making materials for the revolutionaries. She was arrested several times in connection with bombings but was released every time for want of evidence. She supplied Bina Das with the revolver that she used to try to shoot Governor Stanley Jackson in February 1922, and was arrested also on that occasion, but released. In 1933 the British finally succeeded in putting her behind bars. In 1936 she was released and placed under house arrest. In 1938 the Jugantar Party aligned itself with the Indian National Congress, and Kamala also transferred her allegiance to the larger party. Thenceforth she became involved in relief work, especially with the Burmese refugees of 1942 and 1943 and in 1946‚Äì47 with the victims of communal rioting. She was in charge of the relief camp at Noakhali that Gandhi visited in 1946. She worked for women's vocational training at the Congress Mahila Shilpa Kendra and the Dakshineshwar Nari Swabalambi Sadan. She edited the groundbreaking women's journal Mandira for many years. She authored two memoirs in Bengali, Rakter Akshare (In Letters of Blood, 1954) and Swadhinata Sangrame Nari (Women in the Freedom Struggle, 1963).

It is \\"notable as one of the most distinguished surviving examples of English domestic architecture in America.\\" Architecture The Old House is a two-story timber frame structure measuring about , with a clapboarded exterior and gabled roof. Its main facade is on the south side, with a center entrance framed by a simple trim with a segmented-arch lintel. On either side of the door there are three-part casement windows on both the first and second floors. Three similar windows appear on the north (back) side of the house which are careful replicas of the original windows. The interior of the house is divided into four rooms, two on each floor. A large brick chimney separates the rooms on each floor and divides the attic in two. Narrow winding staircases on one side provide access to the upper levels. The ground- floor kitchen has a fireplace over long and deep. At some point (probably in the 18th century), that fireplace and the one in the main hall had smaller fireplaces built within them, with the excess covered by wooden paneling. It is likely that the walls that were not paneled at that time were finished in plaster.  History = Debate over origin  According to the results of a 2003 dendrochronology study, the house was built ca. 1699. Cutchogue-New Suffolk Historical Council, the owner of the house, commissioned a second dendrochronology study in July 2017 to verify the build date, with the same results. Prior to 2017 The Old House was thought to have been built by John Budd on land east of town near a pond that became known as Budd Pond. John Budd's daughter Anna and her husband Benjamin Horton were deeded a house in 1658 as a wedding present. They moved it to a location in the village of Cutchogue. Benjamin's brother John inherited the house and sold it to Joseph Wickham in 1699. These events and transactions are well documented.  Post 17th century  Parker Wickham (February 28, 1727 - May 22, 1785), famous for being a Loyalist politician during the American Revolution and who was banished from the state of New York under dubious circumstances, owned and lived in the house. It was damaged by the Hurricane of 1938 which swept away surrounding trees, leaving it visible from the street and coming to public attention, restored in 1940, and restored again in 1968. and It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. The house is located on the Cutchogue Village Green, along with the 1840 Old Schoolhouse, the 1704 Wickham Farmhouse, a barn, the Cutchogue New Suffolk Free Library, a 19th-century carriage house, and the Old Burying Ground dating from 1717. The buildings are owned and maintained by the Cutchogue-New Suffolk Historical Council, which gives guided tours in the summer.

Early life Treadwell-Collins' father was the son of an Irish farmer, Michael, who emigrated to London from his home near Skibbereen, in West Cork, in the mid 1960s whilst his mother, Linda, is from north London. At the age of fifteen, Treadwell-Collins' father died in a drowning accident whilst on holiday at the family home in Fort Lauderdale, USA. As a child, Treadwell-Collins had ambitions to work for the BBC, as he lived in Radlett, Hertfordshire, near the BBC Elstree Studios, and used to look in through the gates. Education Treadwell-Collins attended St Christopher's primary school in Radlett, and Edge Grove School, an independent school in the village of Aldenham in Hertfordshire, followed by Harrow School, a boarding independent school in Harrow-on-the-Hill in north west London, and then the University of Oxford. Career=Early work Treadwell-Collins' first job in television was for the ITV crime drama series Midsomer Murders, devising means of killing off characters. He moved to Talkback Thames for four years, working as a story producer on the Five soap opera Family Affairs, where he was taught to storyline by Ian Aldwinckle. In 2007, he named the show winning the 2005 British Soap Award for \\"Best Storyline\\" the biggest achievement of his career. Family Affairs was cancelled in 2005, which surprised Treadwell-Collins, who had expected that several award wins meant the show would be extended. He felt that viewers remained \\"incredibly loyal\\" to the series, and that it would have had greater longevity had it aired on a different channel, or been better publicised by Five. EastEnders Treadwell-Collins began working on the BBC soap opera EastEnders in October 2005, as a senior story editor under Brigie de Courcy, before becoming story producer in January 2007. He was responsible for running the EastEnders story department, working with the show's writers to devise future storylines. In his first year on the show, he created the characters Ronnie and Roxy Mitchell, played by Samantha Womack and Rita Simons. In response to criticism of the show's lack of characters with disabilities, EastEnders producers planned to introduce several actors with disabilities in early 2009. Treadwell-Collins felt such characters are often portrayed as being \\"noble or 'worthy'\\", and suggested that EastEnders subvert this stereotype by making the new roles flawed. He created the storyline in which the Muslim character Syed Masood struggled to reconcile his faith and sexuality, and his relationship with Christian Clarke, as well as The Secret Mitchell and the Who Killed Archie? whodunnit, which culminated in the show's first live episode in February 2010. Treadwell-Collins stood down from his EastEnders role on 25 June 2010, becoming head of development at Kudos' Lovely Day production company. The company is run by former EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer, who commented: \\"Dominic is a brilliant and original talent, bursting with great ideas and gripping stories. Many of EastEnders best storylines and characters of the last few years have come directly from his imagination and design, and he played an integral part in conceiving and plotting the hugely successful 25th anniversary episodes. I'm delighted to be resuming our creative partnership at Lovely Day.\\" Treadwell-Collins stated: \\"I have had an amazing time at EastEnders and I couldn't have dreamed of a better place to work. Working on EastEnders has enabled me to create some fantastic storylines and characters that have been received so well but after four-and- a-half years of life in Walford, I feel that it is time to move on and try something new.\\" =As executive producer= On 29 July 2013, it was announced that Treadwell-Collins would be returning to EastEnders as executive producer, taking over from Lorraine Newman, who resigned from the role after sixteen months on the job. Treadwell-Collins assumed the position on 19 August 2013 and his first episode as executive producer aired on 9 December 2013. Treadwell-Collins' first major cast change was to introduce Shirley Carter's (Linda Henry) extended family, who took over The Queen Vic ‚Äì her brother (later revealed to be her son) Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), sister Tina (Luisa Bradshaw-White), Mick's common-law wife Linda (Kellie Bright) and their children Lee (Danny-Boy Hatchard), Nancy (Maddy Hill) and Johnny (Sam Strike). The family was later expanded to include Shirley and Tina's father Stan Carter (Timothy West), their maternal aunt Babe Smith (Annette Badland) and their estranged mother Sylvie (Linda Marlowe), plus Shirley's son Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) who returned to the show after several years. Other major characters introduced by Treadwell-Collins include Dot Branning's (June Brown) grandson Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), Pam (Lin Blakley) wife of established recurring character Les Coker (Roger Sloman), Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond), Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) as Kim Fox's husband, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) as Vincent's mother and Donna's adoptive Mother, and the Kazemi family - Kush (Davood Ghadami), Carmel (Bonnie Langford) and Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi). Treadwell-Collins also reintroduced several characters who had previously featured in the show, including Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner), Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), Les Coker (Roger Sloman), Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton) Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) who all returned permanently, while the likes of Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), Nick Cotton (John Altman) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) returning for guest appearances. The characters of Shabnam Masood, Rebecca Fowler, Ben Mitchell, Martin Fowler, Louise Mitchell, Jordan Johnson and Belinda Peacock were also reintroduced, but the roles were recast to Rakhee Thakrar, Jasmine Armfield, Harry Reid, James Bye, Tilly Keeper, Joivan Wade and Carli Norris respectively. Treadwell-Collins also created a spin-off for the EastEnders characters Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) set in Ireland called Kat & Alfie: Redwater, which started on BBC One and RT√â One in May 2017. Treadwell-Collins' decision to leave the show was announced on 18 February 2016. He described his choice as \\"not one I have taken lightly\\" and citied his reasons for leaving as wanting to \\"move on to other things\\". His final work on the show saw him produce the conclusion to the Who Killed Lucy Beale? storyline and produce the death of Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Of Windsor's request that he produce her exit storyline, Treadwell-Collins said \\"When Dame Barbara comes to you to produce her final episodes, you cannot say no.\\" Treadwell-Collins' final day at EastEnders was on 6 May 2016. Post EastEnders Treadwell-Collins' new post as Head of Television at Blueprint Television was announced on 7 June 2016. Treadwell- Collins stated his admiration of films produced by Blueprints and his excitement to \\"develop their television arm\\". The co-chairman of Blueprint Pictures, Graham Broadbent, added that the company were \\"excited to have someone of his experience and calibre to launch Blueprint's TV side\\".

History Grosbeak was launched as YMS-317, by the South Coast Co., Newport Beach, California, on 27 February 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Marjorie Boutelle; and commissioned 18 November 1943, with Lt. John B. Warner in command. After shakedown, YMS-317 swept the San Francisco Bay area until 3 May 1944, when she sailed for Pearl Harbor. In the Pacific Ocean, she acted as an escort vessel to convoys in back and staging areas, such as Eniwetok, Saipan, and Kwajalein, as well as patrolling and mine-sweeping in these areas. After the war's end, YMS-317 returned to Pearl Harbor for a badly needed overhaul. She reached Charleston, South Carolina, via San Pedro, California, and the Panama Canal in June 1946 and again underwent overhaul. The ship was named Grosbeak and redesignated AMS-14 on 18 February 1947. Grosbeak spent most of her post-war career at the Mine Warfare School, Yorktown, Virginia, and the Naval Minecraft Base at Charleston as a training ship. She also participated in various experiments at the Naval Mine Countermeasures Station, Panama City, Florida, and engaged in numerous exercises along the coast from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. From 24 February to 19 March 1950 Grosbeak was in the Caribbean to participate in Operation PORTREX out of Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, and in February 1951 she became the first of her type to journey from Yorktown to Charleston via the intracoastal waterway. The minesweeper received the coveted Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" for outstanding performance in her class in 1950, 1951, and 1952, one of the few ships in the Navy to receive three such awards. When she was not engaged in sweeping exercises, Grosbeak underwent periodic overhauls at Charleston and also visited Miami, Florida, and New York City. Scheduled for deactivation, Grosbeak sailed to Green Cove Springs, Florida, 16 November 1955 and was decommissioned there on 7 December 1955. The hulk was approved for disposal on 27 October 1959 and Grosbeak's name was struck from the Navy List on 1 November 1959.

Biography = Early life  Arifur Rahman (left) with American political cartoonist Ranan Lurie (right) in Kathmandu, Nepal. Photo from South Asian cartoon congress 2008. Arifur Rahman was born in a small village called Tetiar Kanda in Shahjadpur, Sirajganj, Bangladesh. When Arifur Rahman was in the Preschool, Arif's father left his wife and children and remarried. Arif's parents got divorced afterward and his mother went back to her family's village, taking Arif and his sister along. They were broke and his mother was depressed. Whatever she was to inherit from her father had already been given to her husband in dowry, so she had nothing to get by. Arif, with his mother and sister, lived in a room with their grandmother. Arif's maternal grandfather was a pious man and had two wives. Arif's mother was among the children from his first marriage, but he had come to live with his second wife during those years. It meant he barely saw his first wife. Arif was enrolled in the a nearby school there. Sleep and dream. This cartoon describes the difference between the poor and the richest, and the difference between their dreams and goals. One of the Arifur Rahman's earlier cartoons from 2008. Arif and his family struggled for money. His mother started farming chickens for some pocket money. His uncles and aunts helped out by gifting Arif's mother goat and sheep cubs and he used to take care of the cattle when he returned from school. Arif went to a village school back then, which was far away from his grandfather's house. Arif had to walk a very long way to go to school every day. Their village did not yet have access to electricity so, in the evening, he had to study by the tame flame of a kerosene lamp. He was a self-taught cartoonist and started drawing at an early age. His first cartoon was published in 2004 in a satire magazine called Bichhu by the Daily Jugantor. Every day, he drew cartoons and sent them to the newspapers for publishing. That is how he created a name for himself as a cartoonist.  Education  He studied both in Bangladesh and in Norway. * 2001‚Äì06, Arifur Rahman studied for a Bachelor of Arts at the National University of Bangladesh. * 2012-13 studied Visual Arts at Nansen Academy, Lillehammer, Norway. * 2014-16 studied 3D and Animation at Kristiania University College, Oslo, Norway.  Career  Award-winning Anti-corruption cartoon, Arifur Rahman's cartoon about corruption in Bangladesh 2006. Award- winning Anti-corruption cartoon about Bangladesh 2007, Cartoon by Arifur Rahman.  Cartooning in Bangladesh  In Bangladesh, he was famously known as ‚ÄúCartoonist Arif.‚Äù In April 2004, Arif's cartoon was published in the satire magazine, ‚ÄúBicchu‚Äù under the Daily Jugantor. Since then, he has been drawing political satire cartoons and comic strips instead of paintings. He drew every day and sent his work off to newspapers. Almost all the daily newspapers in Bangladesh regularly published his cartoons back in the day. During 2004‚Äì2007, he drew a large number of cartoons for various Bangladeshi newspapers, such as The Daily Jugantar, Bhorer Kagoj, Samakal, Jaijaidin, Amar Desh, Ittefaq and Prothom Alo. He was noticed by people and known as \\"Cartoonist Arif\\" around Bangladesh. He was recognized by fellow and legendary Bangladeshi cartoonists like Rafiqun Nabi, Shishir Bhattacharjee, and Ahsan Habib. In 2005, Rahman won the third prize in a contest titled Pin Hunt that was put on by The Daily Prothom Alos periodical, Alpin (‡¶Ü‡¶≤‡¶™‡¶ø‡¶®), and won third prize in the Anti-Corruption Cartoon Competition arranged by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) in 2006, as well as first prize in the Anti- Corruption Cartoon Competition arranged by The Daily Star in 2007 and in the same year, The Daily Prothom Alo appointed him to draw cartoons as a contributing cartoonist.  Cartoon controversy in Bangladesh  Arifur Rahman's cartoons were regularly published in the satirical weekly supplement of The Daily Prothom Alo, Alpin, but the one published in the 17 September 17, 2007 edition stirred quite a bit of controversy. The cartoon features a conversation between a little boy and an older man. The apparently funny and harmless cartoon hurt a group of people's Islamic religious sentiments and Arif was sued for his cartoon. Some people led by acclaimed religious influencers chose to call for a nationwide strike in Bangladesh on the back of the incident. Alpin was discontinued and the editor, Sumanta Alam, was fired, effective immediately. The editor of The Daily Prothom Alo, Matiur Rahman promised never to publish Arifur Rahman's cartoon in his newspaper again. And last, but not least, Arif was arrested at his Dhaka residence on September 18, 2007. He was arrested for being a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù and for ‚Äúhurting the religious sentiments‚Äù under the blasphemy and emergency law of Bangladesh.  The trial under Blasphemy Law  Imprisoned on the 18th of September, 2007, Arifur Rahman stayed in prison for six months and 2 days. While in prison, Arif was heartbroken and felt very helpless. He felt wronged by his people and the country. He decided while sitting behind the bars that he would create a platform for the artists and art enthusiasts where they could express their talent and enjoy mindful art without any limitations or without the fear of being misunderstood, wrongfully judged or censored. On 4 February 2008, the High Court ruled Arif's detention illegal, dropped all charges brought against him and ordered his immediate release. But he was not released right away. He was finally freed on 20 March 2008, but the struggle continued for Arif as he found it hard to pursue his cartooning dreams like he used to. He could not continue his studies due to the scandal as universities would not admit him because of his controversial background. In 2009, another case was filed against him in a court in Jessore, Khulna for the very same cartoon published in 2007. The court in Jessore sentenced him to two months of rigorous imprisonment and fined him 500 Bangladeshi Taka, or another seven days in prison for impiety. Many Bangladeshi newspapers refused to publish any more of Arif's cartoons but some of them, the likes of The Daily Ittefaq and The Daily Prothom Alo, however, agreed to publish them under a pseudonym. Arif was disheartened with that turn of events. His desire to create an uncensorable cartooning platform only got stronger with these unpleasant incidents fanning the fire. In 2010, the Government of Norway willingly granted Arif political asylum as his life came to a standstill in Bangladesh and his life was under constant threat. Arif wanted to stay back in his beloved motherland but he was not able to because of his controversy, as he was labeled by his 2007 scandal. Arif also came to fear for his life as one threat after another kept on coming in all shapes and forms. He had no option but to emigrate to Norway on 30 November 2010, and start a new life there for himself and his ambitions. He cannot enter his beloved Bangladesh ever again without being prosecuted.  Cartooning in Norway  In Norway, his cartoons were published in various newspapers and magazines, such as Akershus Amtstidende, Ny Tid, Syn og Segn, Samtiden, Aftenposten, √òstlandposten, √òstlands-Posten, Bladet Vester√•len, Avisa Nordland, Gl√•mdalen, Stavanger Aftenblad and Melding til Stortinget by Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway).  Attack on cartoon exhibition  On March 1, 2017, Arifur Rahman had an exhibition in Dr√∏bak, where some new Syrian refugees appeared in the exhibition place before opening and took two of his drawings. One of the drawings was from 2007 from Bangladesh and another one was a criticism of the education system, ‚ÄúMadrasa Education System‚Äù in Bangladesh.  Online media and publishing platform  Toons Mag logo and symbols of freedom of speech. Arifur Rahman founded Toons Mag on November 1, 2009. With it, Arifur Rahman's ambition was to create a platform for artists around the world to express themselves without ever being concerned about being shut up by others. Toons Mag was everything Arif had dreamed of and more. To this day, Toons Mag promotes freedom of expression and encourages cartoonists around the world to contribute to it to enrich their cartooning expertise.

During Sui Dynasty  It is not known when Du Zhenglun was born, but it is known that he was from what would eventually become Xiang Prefecture (Áõ∏Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei). During the Renshou era (601-604) of Sui Dynasty's founding emperor Emperor Wen, Du Zhenglun and his older brothers Du Zhengxuan () and Du Zhengzang () all passed the imperial examination. As Sui Dynasty imperial examinations were considered unusually difficult‚Äîwith only 10-odd examinees passing each year‚Äîthe Du household received great acclaim for having three brothers who did so. It was said that Du Zhenglun was capable in literature, particularly in explaining meanings of passages. He later served as a military officer in the Sui imperial government.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  During the reign of Sui's successor dynasty Tang Dynasty's founder Emperor Gaozu, Du Zhenglun was initially serving as the military advisor to the commandant at Qi Prefecture (ÈΩäÂ∑û, roughly modern Jinan, Shandong). Emperor Gaozu's son, the major general Li Shimin the Prince of Qin became aware of Du's talents, and invited him to serve as a resident scholar at Li Shimin's mansion.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  In 626, Li Shimin became emperor (as Emperor Taizong). One of his key advisors, Wei Zheng, recommended Du Zhenglun's talent and stated that there were few people as talented. Emperor Taizong then made Du an official at the ministry of defense in 627. In 628, Du was made imperial attendant and put in charge of recording Emperor Taizong's acts for imperial archives. On one occasion, Emperor Taizong stated, \\"Everyday, as I sit in judgment of important matter and get ready to speak, I think carefully about whether what I have to say has any benefit or harm to the people. That is why I do not speak a lot.\\" Du responded, \\"Whatever an emperor says is recorded in history. As my responsibility is to record Your Imperial Majesty's acts, I have to be honest. If any of your words is improper, it will harm your reputation for a thousand years, and it is not only harmful to the people. May Your Imperial Majesty consider this carefully.\\" Emperor Taizong was pleased with these words and gave Du an award of silk. In 630, Du was promoted to the post of Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). In 632, after Du and three other officials, Wei Ting (), Yu Shinan, and Yao Silian had submitted petitions commenting on various imperial acts, Emperor Taizong invited them to a feast, where he thanked them for being honest at danger to themselves (as they risked offending the emperor). Du was soon given titles as imperial advisor and scholar, as well as a member of the staff of Emperor Taizong's crown prince Li Chengqian‚Äîwith Emperor Taizong specifically asked to counsel Li Chengqian in proper behavior. In 636, he was again Zhongshu Shilang, but still served on Li Chengqian's staff; he was also created the Marquess of Nanyang. It was said that Du was known for his capability in handling the matters at both palaces (i.e., the emperor's palace and the crown prince's palace). However, soon Du drew both the emperor's and the crown prince's ires. At that time, Li Chengqian was suffering from a foot ailment that made it difficult for him to walk, and therefore he did not see Emperor Taizong often, but instead spent his time in frivolous activities with associates that Emperor Taizong disapproved of. Emperor Taizong told Du: Du made several suggestions to Li Chengqian, asking him to change his ways, but Li Chengqian did not do so. Du told Li Chengqian what Emperor Taizong told him‚Äîwhich led to Li Chengqian immediately submitting an objection to Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong asked Du, \\"Why did you let him know what I said?\\" Du responded, \\"He did not listen to me, so I wanted to scare him with your words. I hoped that he would be scared and would change his ways.\\" Emperor Taizong was still displeased, and he demoted Du to the post of prefect of Gu Prefecture (Á©ÄÂ∑û, in modern Luoyang, Henan), and later to be the commandant at Jiao Prefecture (‰∫§Â∑û, roughly modern Hanoi, Vietnam). After Li Chengqian was revealed to have plotted with the general Hou Junji to overthrow Emperor Taizong in 643, Du was accused of having received a gold belt from Hou, and he was stripped of his rank and exiled to Huan Prefecture (È©©Â∑û, also in modern Vietnam). However, later he successively served as the prefect of Ying (ÈÉ¢Â∑û, roughly modern Wuhan, Hubei) and Shi (Áü≥Â∑û, roughly modern L√ºliang, Shanxi) Prefectures.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  In 656, Du Zhenglun was serving as the deputy minister of treasury, when Emperor Taizong's son and successor Emperor Gaozong promoted him to serve as Huangmen Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). Emperor Gaozong also gave him the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (), making him a chancellor de facto. Du was also created the Duke of Xiangyang. In 657, he was made Zhongshu Ling (), the head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. Later that year, he concurred with the official Liu Xiangdao that there were too many people made imperial officials, and Emperor Gaozong put them in charge of drafting a proposal to reduce the number of officials. However, their proposal ran into much opposition from other officials and was never carried out. Meanwhile, Du was beginning to have conflict with fellow chancellor Li Yifu, who also carried the title of Zhongshu Ling, as Du considered himself the senior official, but Li, who was an ally of Emperor Gaozong's powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), disrespected Du. They argued frequently before Emperor Gaozong, who rebuked both for not cooperating with each other. On December 6, 658,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Gaozong demoted both to be prefects‚Äîin Du's case, the prefect of Heng Prefecture (Ê©´Â∑û, roughly modern Nanning, Guangxi). Du was said to have died at Heng Prefecture soon thereafter.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 70. * New Book of Tang, vol. 106. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 192, 193, 194, 197, 200.

It is considered by some authors to be a subspecies of the variable indigobird (Vidua funerea). They range from Sierra Leone to east Cameroon, north east Zaire and South Sudan. There are less than 10,000 Vidua camerunensis in total, which range over 20,000 km2 in the savannah and grasslands of South Africa. The birds have a distinct blue color with underlying brown feathers and a small white beak to crack nuts and seeds. There are many indigobird species in the world, and they are mainly known for their song mimicry. The different species of indigobirds are not morphologically different, but they do differ in the songs they choose to mimic.Payne, R. B., Barlow, C. R., Balakrishnan, C. N., & Sorenson, M. D. (2004). \\"Song mimicry of Black-bellied Firefinch Lagonosticta rara and other finches by the brood-parasitic Cameroon Indigobird Vidua camerunensis in West Africa.\\" The Ibis, 147(1), 130‚Äì143. Ecology and behavior Cameroon indigobirds are known for song determination and mimicking the songs of other bird species. The males pick which songs to mimic; however, when one male chooses a song from a host bird, the other males mimic other songs from a different host species. This is an effective way to differentiate males when mimicking the songs. There are several distinct host species that the indigobirds mimic from; the most common are the black-bellied firefinch (Lagonosticta rara) and African firefinch (L. rubricata). The variation in how indigobirds mimic different songs is based on the host species.Balakrishnan, C. N., Sefc, K. M., & Sorenson, M. D. (2009). \\"Incomplete reproductive isolation following host shift in brood parasitic indigobirds.\\" Proceedings: Biological Sciences, 276 (1655), 219‚Äì228. Researchers have thought that because different indigobird species sing different songs, they must be reproductively isolated. However, when a paternity test was done between the differentspecies, it was found that the birds were not reproductively isolated. They concluded that indigobirds switch songs among several different hosts, but that this switching does not mean that the species are biologically different. In fact, they are very much related to one another in which they are not isolated from other species. Reproductive isolation cannot be determined just by the shifts of song mimicry from different hosts. The indigobirds also use song mimicry for sexual and natural selection. Male indigobirds are most territorial and aggressive when they hear their own song or the host song that they mimic.Balakrishnan, C. N. (2006). \\"Song discrimination suggests premating isolation among sympatric indigobird species and host races.\\" Behavioral Ecology: Official Journal of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology, 17 (3), 473‚Äì478. These birds know and recognize which song is the one they mimic, compared to what other species mimic. For natural selection, it is in the bird's favor to mimic another song compared to other species. They save resources because they do not have to fight with others to mark their territory, thus decreasing their aggressiveness. As for sexual selection, females are attracted to males that master the art of mimicry.Payne, R. B., Hustler, K., Stjernstedt, R., Sefc, K. M., & Sorenson, M. D. (2002). \\"Behavioural and genetic evidence of a recent population switch to a novel host species in brood-parasitic indigobirds Vidua chalybeata.\\" The Ibis, 144(3), 373‚Äì383. A female decides to mate with the male who sings the song that is most known to the females. The eggs are laid in another host's nest instead of their own. Song discrimination is also very important in the young. They learn to sing and mimic songs in their sensitive period.Balakrishnan, C. N., & Sorenson, M. D. (2006). \\"Dispersal ecology versus host specialization as determinants of ectoparasite distribution in brood parasitic indigobirds and their estrildid finch hosts.\\" Molecular Ecology, 16 (1), 217‚Äì229. It is very important in establishing their mimicry for the best fit in natural selection and reproduction with sexual selection. Brood parasites These birds are obligate brooding parasites, meaning they lay eggs in other birds' nests.Dacosta, J. M., & Sorenson, M. D. (2014, 10). \\"An experimental test of host song mimicry as a species recognition cue among male brood parasitic indigobirds (Vidua spp.).\\" The Auk, 131(4), 549-558. doi:10.1642/auk-14-35.1 The learning of the songs and imprinting is also obligate for them because this is how they increase their fitness. The male have impressive vocal repertoires that can be used to mimic, calling, or mating. DaCosta et al. found evidence that host mimicry is an important cue for species recognition among the territorial male birds. They predict that this could have arisen due to when juveniles transform into adults and they tend to be dispersed. These calls help them recognize and locate other birds in the same species are. They also did a study on how different mimicry can elicit different responses in these birds. In the experimental group, the scientists recorded these calls and played them to the captive birds. In the control group, they sounded natural calls for the captive birds. They found that birds tended to respond differently to the audio recording compared to natural singing. Scientists have tested whether female indigobirds have a preference as to what type of songs the male indigobird sings. They found that females choose males that have the closest song that matched the foster parent's songs.Payne, R. B., Payne, L. L., Woods, J. L., & Sorenson, M. D. (2000, 01). Imprinting and the origin of parasite‚Äìhost species associations in brood-parasitic indigobirds, Vidua chalybeata. Animal Behaviour, 59 (1), 69-81. doi:10.1006/anbe.1999.1283 For example, if the female was going to lay an egg in the Bengalese finches, she would want a mate that would mimic the song of these Bengalese finches. This is also not due to innate bias for songs, as they prefer songs that improve their fitness and survival. Most of how species are named is based on the biological species concept, so it is a critical role to know which species of birds these were breeding. Imprinting and sexual courtships are very important in these type of birds, as they need to behave a certain way to lay their eggs. The males of these indigobirds courted heterospecific females to increase genetic diversity.Sorenson, M. D., Hauber, M. E., & Derrickson, S. R. (2010, 05). \\"Sexual imprinting misguides species recognition in a facultative interspecific brood parasite.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 277 (1697), 3079-3085. doi:10.1098/rspb.2010.0592 These males know that to increase fitness, they need to mate with females who have the highest genetic diversity to pass on to the offspring. Due to this, there has been molecular analysis done on these birds to show the clades of the phylogenetic tree.Sefc, K. M., Payne, R. B., & Sorenson, M. D. (2005, 04). \\"Genetic continuity of brood- parasitic indigobird species.\\" Molecular Ecology, 14 (5), 1407-1419. doi:10.1111/j.1365-294x.2005.02492.x The scientists did the analysis on all the birds that were similar to multiple host colonizations. They each contributed to interbreeding populations that acquired the singing from these host species. They hypothesized that interbreeding is relevant in these birds because they mate with several species, so it hard to distinctly specify species of one clade. In the creation of the phylogenetic tree, their found that African brood parasitic finches are actually the host specialists that mimic the songs and nestling of their finch hosts.Sorenson, M., Balakrishnan, C., & Payne, R. (2004, 02). \\"Clade-Limited Colonization in Brood Parasitic Finches (Vidua spp.).\\" Systematic Biology, 53 (1), 140-153. doi:10.1080/10635150490265021 These birds also have high rates of cospeciation, as many of these birds interbreed with one another. Host switches have also been involved in the creation of new hosts with the close or same related genus, which would be apparent for congruence of the hosts and the parasitic birds.

It combines elements of rhythm and strategy. In the game, the player acts as an invisible deity to a tribe of anthropomorphic eye- balls known as \\"Patapons\\" that can be commanded to move forward, attack, defend and retreat by using a sequence of drum beats. The story follows the journey of the Patapon tribe in their journey to reach Earthend and gaze upon \\"IT\\". Throughout their adventure, they encounter giant beasts and an enemy tribe known as the Zigotons that serve as obstacles. The game's concept and design were conceived when game designer Hiroyuki Kotani discovered the Patapon designs from French artist Rolito's personal website. The name was created by Rolito and was inspired by an old French word for \\"children\\". Kotani chose the name for the words \\"Pata\\" marching and \\"Pon\\" for drumming. Patapon was released in Japan in December 2007 and later in February 2008 for North America and Europe. It was well-received among critics. The game led to two sequels for the PSP; Patapon 2 and Patapon 3, and a port to the PlayStation 4. Gameplay Patapon is a video game that the player controls in a manner similar to rhythm games. The player takes the role of a deity worshipped by an anthropomorphic eye-ball army known as Patapons. The player can command the warriors by inputting specific sequences using the face buttons on the PSP (‚óã √ó ‚ñ≥ ‚ñ°), each representing a drum. These sequences can command the tribe to move forward, attack, defend, and other actions. Successfully entering a proper sequence in sync with the rhythm will lead the tribe into a \\"Fever\\" increasing their attack and defensive bonuses. If the player ceases to command the Patapons, inputs an unknown sequence, or enters them off-beat, the tribe will become confused and stop whatever they are doing, losing the combo and Fever. The game is divided into several missions. Prior to each mission, the player can recruit new troops and assemble formations, equip troops with weapons and armor gained from the spoils of war, or crafted from certain minigames. The player can return to an earlier mission to acquire additional resources and equipment to build up their troops before a larger battle. Story The Patapon Tribe were flourishing people until they experienced many tragic losses and later on, they were maltreated by the Zigoton Empire (although Ormen Karmen of the Karmen Tribe originally defeated them and overtook the Patapole Palace). The player takes the role of their god, the \\"Almighty\\", and uses sacred war drums (Pata, Pon, Chaka, Don) to direct the Patapons to recover their land. As the story progresses, the Patapons embark on a journey to Earthend to look upon \\"IT\\", a sacred object whose appearance is unknown to the tribe and whose purpose is to grant the Patapons eternal contentment and true happiness. The enemy of the Patapons is the evil Zigoton Empire, a powerful tribe of slightly squarish creatures with red-and-black eyes (as opposed to the white-and-black-eyed Patapons) that have oppressed the Patapons since their fall from power. It becomes apparent later in the game that the Zigotons have their own prophecy which foretells that when the Patapons finally see and gaze at \\"IT\\", the world will fall into chaos. Towards the end of the game, many of the main Zigoton warriors sell their souls to the dark forces in an attempt to gain more power. Eventually, Queen Kharma, ruler of the Zigotons, sells her soul in a final attempt to destroy the Patapons. When she is defeated, the Patapons have to kill Gorl, the demon that once threatened the world. Once defeated, the 3 Yaripons from the beginning arrive at the coast, which they assumed to be Earthend, and see the rising sun, which they assume to be \\"IT\\". However, unfulfilled by the anticlimactic end of their journey, they come to the conclusion that \\"IT\\" is, in fact, not the sun and to realize their destiny, they must cross the ocean to the real Earthend and continue their quest. At the end of the game, there is a scene in which the Patapons and the Zigotons are working together to build a boat to cross the sea. Development and release Patapon was developed by Pyramid and produced by SCE Japan Studio. The game was designed by Hiroyuki Kotani. The game was originally announced on June 11, 2007, during the E3 2007 press conference. The designs for the Patapons were originally created in 2002 by Rolito and were featured as part of his personal website in 2004. When Kotani discovered their design, he envisioned the creatures marching into battle and chose to create a video game entirely based on their design. Kotani contacted Rolito through a representative group known as Interlink in 2005 and recruited him to develop the game using the Patapon characters. Rolito was tasked with creating a fictional universe for the characters. Rolito conceived the name from an old French nursery rhyme which used the word \\"Patapon\\" for children. Kotani chose the name due to it resembling the sounds of marching and commands. The development team would provide drafts and be evaluated by Rolito. Once approved, Rolito would provide the final design. The game developed for two years with the first 21 months developing the prototype and the remaining 3 months dedicated to mass production. Kotani aimed to create a game that never existed before. Kotani's main goal was to make the game simple. Kotani chose to recruit Pyramid to develop their game based on their previous work. The original concept of Patapon was to control the characters using adjectives and complex grammar, however, was simplified to making the commands more onomatopoeic once the name was decided. The game was developed in a way that allowed players to play with two different play-styles: playing it as a simple game and the other as a complex game. One of the most difficult challenges to develop was the dialogue for the enemy army, Zigoton, due to the player possibly unable to read it during gameplay. Kemmei Adachi served as composer while Kotani wrote the lyrics. Kemmei was recruited from the game's conception and proposed ideas to develop the game. Music was composed of multiple African instruments. Pyramid proposed to make the Patapons sing back to the player once a command was sent. Vocals for the songs were provided by Kemmei and Kotani's son who was 10 years old at the time. It was released in Japan on December 20, 2008. It was later released in Europe on February 22, 2008, and in North America on February 26, 2008. To promote the game, an event was held from December 5 to December 17, 2007 at the Sample Lab in Omotesando, Tokyo. A demo was released on February 7, 2008 in Japan. A demo for North America and Europe was released later on February 14, 2008. The demo provided an exclusive weapon that could be transferred to the main game. A port for PlayStation 4 was released worldwide on August 1, 2017.  Reception  The game was well-received among critics. Metacritic has an aggregate score of 86 out of 100. IGN considers Patapon, \\"not only one of the best rhythm games ever released, it's also one of the best titles for the PSP.\\" GameSpot gave Patapon cited its excellent art design and innovative gameplay. 1UP.com noted its understated strategic depth despite the game's faults. The game has sold 229,000 copies in North America by January 2009. GameSpot nominated this game in \\"Best of 2008\\" awards. It was nominated in \\"Best Graphic, Artistic\\", \\"Best original game mechanic\\", \\"Best original IP\\", \\"Best Rhythm/Music game\\", \\"Best PSP game\\" and won \\"Best original music\\" and \\"Most innovative game\\". IGN awarded the game for Best Music/Rhythm game, Best Artistic Design, Best Original Score, Best New IP, and PSP Game of the Year. Famitsu inducted into their Hall of Fame under their \\"Platinum\\" rank. Sequels On July 9, 2008, Patapon 2 was announced. The game was released on UMD on November 27, 2008, in Japan and on February 13, 2009, in Europe. The North American version was released May 5, 2009, as a digital format download from the PlayStation Store. People who reserved a copy of the game at a retail store were given a voucher to download it from the PlayStation Store. The game features new bosses and new units, a multiplayer mode, and the appearance of a new tribe. During E3 2010, Sony announced Patapon 3.

Aim Cape May Stage provides professional Equity theatre, in an intimate setting, to the residents and visitors of Cape May and surrounding areas, and fosters arts education in academic and non-traditional venues. The history of Cape May stage Cape May Stage has operated as a professional Equity theatre since 1988. It was founded by Michael Laird, a Cape May resident and professional actor and director. For the first five seasons the theatre operated in the summer months only. Programming eventually grew to a 70 night season in 1992. In 1995, leasing of the former Welcome Center (a city owned historical landmark building) as a performance site was established. The 1853 structure is considered one of the key buildings in the Historic Landmark district by the Historic Preservation Commission. Grant funding from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts was awarded in 1996, which allowed for further improvements to the company‚Äôs productions. In 1998, the theatre programming expanded to an eight month/six production season, to more fully serve the year-round residents and off-season visitors to the Cape May area. Upon the passing of Cape May Stage‚Äôs founder in 2001, a new artistic director, Michael Carleton, was recruited and hired to run the day-to-day operations of the theatre as well as to expand the programming and services provided to the community and its visitors. In 2008, Cape May Stage celebrated their 20th anniversary season with the unveiling of the restored Robert Shackleton Playhouse. Cape May Stage programming Cape May Stage operates from mid-May through December with over 150 performances. Shows produced are mostly traditional and contemporary works, and new works by both established and up- and-coming playwrights. The shows produced annually include six or seven main stage productions plus featured solo productions that range from Magicians and Puppet Shows to new and original biographical one-act plays frequently scheduled on Monday and Tuesday nights during the season. Directors, designers, actors, production staff, and teaching artists are brought in from around the country (New York, Philadelphia, Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles) to fulfill an eight-month production season and ten-month education outreach calendar. In addition to award winning regional artists, Cape May Stage has also attracted renowned actors such as Robert Prosky (Tony Award nominee) and Estelle Parsons (Academy Award winner) to take part in projects. In 2008, the theatre‚Äôs production of Arthur Miller‚Äôs The Price which starred Robert Prosky and his two sons, transferred to The Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, the nation‚Äôs oldest theatre, and then to Theatre J in Washington D.C. to be part of a national Miller celebration. The annual production roster generally includes at least one world premiere, and several New Jersey or regional premieres. For several seasons now Cape May Stage has been able to bring a nationally renowned playwright to Cape May to work in conjunction with the company on a production of the playwright‚Äôs work. Past seasons have included Tony and Emmy Award winners and a Pulitzer nominee.

The film was directed by John Henderson with a screenplay by Richard Everett and Christopher Villiers. Plot Sergeant Peter King and Private Leslie Cuthbertson of the Royal Army Dental Corps passionately desire to see active service, but are held back. Armed with two revolvers and a handful of grenades, they plan an unauthorised mission to occupied France. They write to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, explaining their intention to fight the Germans. After they finally succeed in getting to France, they stumble across a German radar station. They blow up what they take to be the main operations room, and then the entire compound unexpectedly erupts with gunfire and explosions. They narrowly evade the Germans and escape in a boat which is later blown up by a mine; the men are picked up by the British and interrogated as possible spies. Once their identities have been established, they are returned to barracks to be court- martialed as deserters. An aide of Churchill had seen their letter, and knew of a commando raid on the radar facility which was facilitated by a diversion due to mysterious explosions in what they discover was actually the cookhouse. The aide intervenes in the court martial, establishes their presence at the enemy radar station and conveys an invitation to tea with the Prime Minister should they ever be in Whitehall. The court nevertheless demotes Sergeant King to the rank of corporal and remands Private Cuthbertson to military prison for 28 days, lenient sentences for desertion in wartime. A note on screen tells the viewer that the men never meet again. Cast * Kenneth Cranham as Sgt. Peter King * Leo Bill as Pte.

It is the first book of the Saga of Pliocene Exile (known as the Saga of the Exiles in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth). The novel sets the series up by introducing the story of each of the characters. The main purpose of the book is to provide information for the rest of the series, only beginning the main storyline in its final part.  Characters = Group Green  ;Elizabeth Orme: Elizabeth was a talented metapsychic practitioner on the human-colonised ski-resort planet Denali, but suffered severe injuries which resulted in the loss of her metapsychic abilities. Unable to cope with the trauma of this, she travelled to the Pliocene hoping to travel freely in a hot air balloon. But in an ironic twist, the shock of time travel caused her operant powers to return. The Tanu race regard her with awe as no other naturally operant metapsychics have come through the gate, and treat her as something of a celebrity. Elizabeth is a peace-loving redactor with little interest in politics, but her knowledge of advanced Milieu metapsychic techniques and her high level of metapsychic power make her an important player in the Tanu court, whether she likes it or not. ;Aiken Drum: A persistent troublemaker, young Aiken Drum refused to be bent to the will of society. Offered the choice of incarceration, docilization or euthanasia, he instead chose Exile to the Pliocene. Always landing on his feet, his quick wits and schemes earned him respect from his fellow time travelers, and his latent metapsychic abilities earned him a silver torc from the Tanu. But a greater future lies ahead for this maverick Scot. ;Felice Landry: Felice starts the book as a tremendously talented athlete from the Canadian planet Acadie, with superhuman strength and an uncanny ability to control animals which allowed her to dominate the planet-wide beloved sport of ring hockey but also with barely submerged psychopathy. She chooses to go into Exile when she is banned from her sport after two other players accused her of deliberately injuring them. In Exile she discovers her powers are stronger than she had previously expected but refused to be tested by the Tanu and have this revealed. Later in the book, Felice joins the Lowlives helping them discover that 'Blood-Metal' (aka iron) can kill the 'Exotics'. She is determined to get a Gold Torc throughout the book, confident that it will make her powerful enough to take on the Tanu. ;Richard Voorhees: Richard is a xenophobic ex-spacer who came to Pliocene after being sued by an alien space crew who he refused to help whilst on a mission for a client. Richard tries to act tough throughout the book and often refuses to help other people, especially the Lowlives, but always comes through for them in the end. Richard is most notable in the book for being the first human to kill a Tanu, in the process discovering the fact that Tanu and Firvulag both are instantly killed upon contact with iron. He also flies the aircraft at the end of the book, as the only one with enough experience to work out how. ;Bryan Grenfell: Bryan works as an anthropologist in the Galactic Milieu but goes into Exile in pursuit of his love, Mercy. When he arrives in the Many Colored Land, he is regarded as special by the Tanu, who allow him to work bareneck without any torc, as he refuses to wear even a gold torc while he is there. In the times where Bryan is the main view-point he often quotes \\"There is a lady sweet and kind\\" by Thomas Ford: There is a lady sweet and kind, Was never face so pleas'd my mind; I did but see her passing by, And yet I love her till I die. ;Stein Olsen: An ex-driller with deep psychological scars from the death of his mother. He is of immediate interest to the Tanu, who want him as a competitor in the ritual Great Combat due to his heroic physique. With the help of Elizabeth, he is mentally healed by the human woman Sukey, with whom he falls in love. ;Annamaria Roccaro: A nun who develops complex relationships with Claude and Felice. ;Claude Majewski: A retired, widowed palaeontologist, planning to see the 'fossil Zoo'. (Majewski was May's father's original family name.)  Other human exiles  * Mercedes Lamballe  The Tanu  ;Lord Creyn: Creyn is a kindly redactor, a specialist in healing, who takes Elizabeth under his wing and appears to know of Marc's destiny. ;Lord Velteyn: Aggressive and the leader of the Flying Hunt, Velteyn is the city lord of Finiah, site of the barium mine where the raw materials for torcs are produced. ;Nodonn Battlemaster: Nodonn is a powerful psychokinetic and the battle champion of the Tanu, and the husband of Mercy, Bryan Grenfell's beloved. ;Lady Epone: Epone is the cruel coercive Tanu lady who oversees the transport of some of the prisoners from Castle Gateway, and also conducts their psychic testing. She is the first Tanu to be killed in the book, at the hands of her prisoners armed with iron.  The Firvulag  ;Yeochee: King of the Firvulag ;Pallol One Eye: Battlemaster, or military commander and champion of the Firvulag, and a \\"first-comer\\" thus over a millennium old at the time of the events of the series.

Life Juan de Sessa a was the son of a black woman from Ethiopia, slave of the second Duke consort of Sessa since 1520, and Luis Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (c.1480-1526). He went to Granada where he was educated together with his owner's son Gonzalo II Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (1520-1578) (third of the same title), and with the grandson of another famous Gonzalo, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, called \\"Gran Capit√°n\\". His literary and fiercest personal enemy, Le√≥n Roque de Santiago, mentioned that Juan Latino was born in Baena, son of a black slave woman and his master, the Duke of Sessa, Luis Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, who was father of his childhood friend and protector Gonzalo II Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. Juan Latino excelled in classical languages and music, and studied with the famous grammarian Pedro de Mota. The Duke himself commented on his dexterity: rara avis in terra corbo simillima nigro (\\"a rare bird, black like a crow\\"). The University of Granada had been opened in 1526, five months after the coming of the emperor to the city. After the papal bull, it began to confer degrees in 1533 and was set free on 1538. In 1545, in the presence of the Archbishop, the listener of the Real Chancery, Conde de Tendilla, and many other gentlemen, Juan Latino received the degree of Bachelor. He was 28 years old at that time. One of the houses he frequently visited to teach his varied grammatical teachings was the property of the Duke's administrator, Licenciado Carleval, whose young daughter, Ana de Carleval, was famous in the city because of her extraordinary beauty and fianc√©e (by her father) to Don Fernando de Valor (future Ab√©n Humeya), received classes.

Operational history The second ship to be named Reedbird by the Navy was laid down as YMS-291 by the Associated Shipbuilders, Seattle, Washington, 29 January 1943; launched 20 April 1943, and commissioned 9 August 1943. Delayed by a lack of equipment, YMS-291 completed shakedown 11 November 1943 and 4 days later reported for 5 months duty with the Western Sea Frontier. In mid-April 1944 she headed west to join the U.S. 5th Fleet's Amphibious Force for Operation Forager, the invasion and occupation of the Marianas. Assigned to TG 52.12, the minesweeping and hydrographic survey group, she commenced operations in the Marianas with the assault on Saipan, 15 June, continued them through operations against Guam and Tinian, into the new year, 1945. In late March, she steamed north, operated in the Iwo Jima area through the first week in April, then returned to Saipan, whence she sailed for the United States. Arriving at San Pedro, California, 19 May, YMS-291 headed west again 20 July. Brief operations in Hawaii and in the Marshalls followed and, after the cessation of hostilities, she returned to Saipan where she joined task force TF 95 and continued westward for postwar sweeping operations in Japanese and Korean waters. From 3 November to 7 December she swept channels in the Fukuoka area, then shifted to Honsh≈´ and until March 1946 operated primarily in the Inland Sea. YMS-291 departed Kobe for the United States 11 March. Arriving at San Francisco, California, 26 April, she was ordered to the U.S. East Coast whence she proceeded up the Atlantic coast, ascended the St. Lawrence River and entered the Great Lakes, arriving at her homeport, Chicago, Illinois, in the fall. There on 1 November 1946, she decommissioned and was placed in service for duty as a Naval Reserve Training Ship. Named Reedbird and redesignated AMS-51, 1 September 1947, she trained Reservists of the 9th Naval District for 3 years. In November 1949 she headed for New Orleans, Louisiana, thence sailed to Orange, Texas, where she was placed out of service 6 December 1949 and berthed as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was recommissioned 15 February 1951 and assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. For the next 6¬Ω years, Reedbird redesignated MSCO-51 on 7 February 1955, remained on the east coast, operating primarily in the Charleston, South Carolina, Yorktown, Virginia, Newport, Rhode Island, and Key West, Florida, areas on various assignments ranging from local operations and training exercises, including schoolship and Naval Reserve training duties, to operational testing for the Naval Ordnance Lab and hydrographic surveys. Reassigned to the Pacific coast and to reserve training duties in September 1957, Reedbird transited the Panama Canal and in November arrived at San Diego, California, where she decommissioned 16 December. Attached to the 11th Naval District as Naval Reserve Training Ship, she remained in southern California until transferred, 6 years later, to the 3rd Naval District and assigned reserve training duty at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The MSCO continued her training duties there until ordered to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1968 for inactivation.

The highway is named for Harry M. Wurzbach, who represented the San Antonio area in Congress as a Republican in the 1920s and 1930s. The congressman's name was first applied to the connecting Wurzbach Road. The highway's western third was built as an expressway with at-grade intersections and the remainder as a freeway. The opening in September 2015 of an interchange with U.S. Highway 281 (US 281) completed primary construction of the parkway. The highway, along with part of Wurzbach Road near the Ingram Park Mall, is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation despite not carrying a state highway designation. Rather, it is being developed and maintained under the Principal Arterial State System (PASS) program, under which it is designated as PASS Project 1502. The parkway includes an interchange with US 281, and drivers can access I-10 and I-35 via local roads that extend the parkway. Route description The west portion of the parkway is a limited-access surface road that connects Lockhill‚ÄìSelma Road to West Avenue, crossing Blanco Road (FM 2696) with an interchange, and Military Highway (Farm to Market Road 1535 , FM 1535) at-grade. Wurzbach Road continues southwest from Lockhill-Selma Road, crossing I-10 at exit 561. The area between West Avenue and Wetmore Road includes an interchange with US 281. From Wetmore Road, on the northeast side of the San Antonio International Airport, the parkway continues east beyond Thousand Oaks Drive. At the east end are several at-grade intersections before the parkway ends at O'Connor Road and Crosswinds Way; O'Connor Road leads southeast to I-35 at exit 169. History Planners conceived the parkway in the mid-1980s as the East‚ÄìWest Parkway, an extension of the existing Wurzbach Road, to relieve traffic on I-410. The road, estimated to cost $90 million, was approved by the Texas Transportation Commission in 1988, to be built by the state but funded in part by the City of San Antonio. Construction began in mid-1994 on the section between Wetmore Road and Nacogdoches Road and opened in July 1996. and the eastern portion of the roadway opened on August 26, 1999, allowing traffic to bypass I-410. The west section was opened on July 24, 2002, its fourth section opened on December 23, 2013. In September 2015, the central stretch of the parkway opened to traffic, effectively completing the project after 21 years. The Alamo Regional Mobility Authority (RMA) conducted a supplemental environmental assessment on the entire corridor from Lockhill‚ÄìSelma Road to I-35, emphasizing the segment that had not been constructed. The EA supplemented the EA completed several years prior to initial construction. The Alamo RMA considered three alternatives for the interchange with US 281. The first alternative was a Wurzbach Parkway bridge over US 281 with no direct connection between the two highways, but with access via the highway's two frontage roads (this option was chosen). The second option would have included an elevated roundabout interchange to provide direct access between the highways. The final alternative would have involved main lane to main lane connector ramps from Wurzbach Parkway to US 281 and loop ramps for access from US 281 to Wurzbach Parkway. According to the San Antonio Express-News, the Texas Transportation Commission reviewed the parkway expansion on November 19, 2009. The project was funded by proceeds from Proposition 12 bonds approved by voters in 2007, a package which was voted on by commissioners. Clay Smith, TxDOT's San Antonio District planning engineer, said the Wurzbach Parkway project would get $126 million under the bond-financing plan, enough for TxDOT to finish the three final segments left on the parkway. The expansion construction was completed in two phases: the first from Blanco Road to West Avenue and from Jones Maltsberger Road to Wetmore; the second between West Avenue and Jones Maltsberger. The parkway has no ramps that connect directly to I-35 to the east (only allowing drivers to use O'Connor Road that leads to the parkway) and no plans for Wurzbach Parkway to extend to I-10 to the west (only allowing drivers to use the Wurzbach Road exit to connect to the parkway). Future Currently, work is underway to construct a land bridge over Wurzbach Parkway between the two sections of Hardberger Park, which the parkway currently splits in two; the project is on track to be completed in fall 2020. TxDOT has also proposed improvements to the parkway's intersections at NW Military Highway and Lockhill-Selma Road.

The couple resided in Minnesota in the United States, but returned to Freetown in 2007 when Sam-Sumana was named as running mate by opposition leader Ernest Bai Koroma on the ticket of the All People's Congress (APC). Sam Sumana led a breakaway faction of the APC known as Coalition for Change (C4C) and contested in the 2018 elections winning 8 Parliamentary seats and several council seats in the strategic Kono district. In a chaotic turn of events in the former ruling APC party, the arrest and harassment of former APC party and government officials, many see Samuel Sam Sumana as the game changer with the character and appeal to bring back the party into power in 2023. Early life Sahr Samuel Tamba Sidique Sam-Sumana was born on April 17, 1962 at the Koidu Government Hospital in Koidu Town, Kono District in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. Sam-Sumana is the fourth son of his father, Sahr Samuel Sam- Sumana, a prominent Kono Chief who was a member of the All People's Congress party and a close friend of President Siaka Stevens.http://politicosl.com/2012/09/removing-vp-sam-sumana-is-a-political- miscalculation/ Sam-Sumana's mother is Haja Sia Hawa Sam-Sumana. Sam-Sumana is a devout Muslim and a member of the Kono ethnic group. Sam-Sumana attended the Koidu Primary school in Koidu Town and then proceeded to the Jaiama Muslim Secondary School in the town of Jaiama, just outside Koidu Town in Kono District. He also attended the Ahmadiyya Muslim secondary school in Freetown. Career and education Sam-Sumana has a Bachelor of Science (BSC) in management information systems from the Metropolitan State University in Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. He also has a diploma in diamond rough grading, sorting and polishing from the America Institution of Diamond Cutting and Polishing, in Deerfield Beach, Florida, United States, and a diploma in computer network support from Knollwood Computer and Business School in St Louis Park, Minnesota. While in the United States, Sam-Sumana had worked as a systems officer for the Prudential Financial Group. He was employed as a network support specialist for Allina Health in the United States. Sam-Sumana had served as the managing director of the United Diamond Mining Company based in Koidu Town, Kono District, Sierra Leone. He also served as the regional manager for C-12 International, a Texas based mining company engaged in diamond production in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Political career Sam-Sumana was surprisingly selected by Sierra Leone's main opposition leader Ernest Bai Koroma as his running-mate for the 2007 presidential election. Sam-Sumana stood as the vice-presidential candidate of the All People's Congress (APC) in the 2007 election, alongside Koroma; the APC ticket defeated the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) presidential candidate Solomon Berewa and vice presidential candidate Momodou Koroma. Sam- Sumana took office as vice president on September 17, 2007. Bribery allegations On November 23, 2011, an Al Jazeera report which was broadcast globally and was produced by Sierra Leonean journalist Sorious Samura, provided an allegation implicating Vice President Sumana and business associates Alex Mansaray and Momoh Konte in a corrupt timber license deal. This was locally referred to as the Timbergate scandal. Sumana later reportedly admitted to Al Jazeera that Mansaray and Konte were well known to him, but that he knew nothing about their collection of cash on his behalf. Sumanas supporters attempted to discredit the allegations through the state media and other friendly media. A Reformer Sam Sumana led a number of reforms in the social services and economic sectors. He changed the punitive system from Prisons to Correctional centers. He led a radical change in the conduct of business by pushing for reforms in business registration processes. He constantly pushed for a reengineering of the settled zones to cater for climate change and to prevent natural disasters, through his push for a comprehensive land reform. He has been a key advocate for mining reforms that carefully addresses environmental concerns and responsibility.  The APC Fracas  On March 17, 2015, Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma sacked Sam-Sumana as vice president on the ground that he had abandoned his position to seek an asylum in the United States Embassy in Freetown, and for not belonging to a political party as stated in the constitution. Though it was reported that Sam-Sumana fled his residence fearing for his life, before soldiers had surrounded his house and disarmed his security team. The Sierra Leon government said Sam-Sumana was not in any danger and that soldiers only came to Sam-Sumana's house to rotate his security team. President Ernest Bai Koroma sacked Sam-Sumana for also not belonging to a political party, as stated in the constitution, though he was expelled from the APC party by the National Advisory Council of the All People's Congress. On March 6, 2015, Sam- Sumana was expelled from the ruling All People's Congress party by the APC's National Advisory Council on the basis of several charges against him. The National Advisory Council accused Sam-Sumana of giving false information about his master's degree certificate; he was accused of instigating political violence in Kono District; he was accused of trying to form a breakaway faction of a new political party; and was also wrongly accused of giving false information about his religious background. The charges were announced by APC Secretary-General Osman Foday Yansaneh at the party's headquarters in Freetown. After the expulsion, Sam-Sumana fled his home on March 14, 2015 and went to the American embassy in Freetown, where he asked for asylum. In a turn of events in the 2018 elections, the same Osman Foday Yansaneh came on live TV to apologize to Sam Sumana that his illegal dismissal from the party was void and the APC has reinstated him into the party.  Awards and Global Recognitions  H.E Sam Sam Sumana has received a number of Global Awards and recognitions for his unique role in advocating for Peace and transformative governance in Africa. On August 10, 2018, he was appointed to the Global Advisory Council of the HWPL and WARP. He and other Former Heads of States including Former President of mozammbque H.E Joaquim Chissano were present to discuss how peace can be sustainably achieved in Africa. In 2017, he received the prestigious peace award given by the Women's Situation room in Sierra Leone. The award plaque presentation was made His Excellency John Dramani Mahama, Former President of Ghana. The WSR is a peacebuilding initiative that empowers women to be the leading force for democratic and peaceful elections. The concept was first introduced by Yvette Chesson-Wureh, coordinator for the Liberia-based Angie Brooks International Centre (ABIC), a non-governmental organisation working on women's empowerment. The WSR is an initiative that mobilises, harnesses and taps into the expertise and experiences of women to act to mitigate potential conflict, leading to violence that could emerge before, during and after elections. It empowers women and youth to play an active and direct role in peace and security efforts, and to engage in peace processes and conflict prevention mechanisms in accordance with UNSC resolutions 1325 and 1820. The initiative was first used during the 2011 elections in Liberia, and has since been successfully replicated in Kenya (2013), Senegal (2012), Sierra Leone (2012), Nigeria (2014) and Uganda (2016), among other countries. There were also plans to use it in Burkina Faso, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Togo. The operational approach of the WSR is expected to differ in individual countries, allowing for flexibility to adapt to local conditions and dynamics. He won the Man of the year by 2017 in the United States of America by ICHANGE NATIONS. Samuel Sam Sumana was awarded the African Star Award for Leadership by the ECOWAS Youth Council for outstanding boldness in defence of good governance, reform and rule of law.

Blythe was also an accomplished portraitist and poet. He is widely regarded as the Pittsburgh region's pre-eminent nineteenth-century painter. Early years Blythe was born in East Liverpool, Ohio on May 9, 1815 to poor parents of Scots and Irish ancestry. After a childhood in a log cabin by the Ohio River, at the age of 16, Blythe moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There he apprenticed himself to woodcarver Joseph Woodwell. After his apprenticeship Blythe returned to East Liverpool for a time and then joined the United States Navy in 1837. His service on the USS Ontario included voyages to the Caribbean islands and Mexico. After his discharge from the Navy, Blythe returned to East Liverpool and took up work as an itinerant portrait painter. Always restless, Blythe traveled widely from Baltimore to Philadelphia and perhaps as far as New Orleans. Other than his stint with Woodwell, Blythe had no known artistic education or training and his early East Liverpool portraits were ungraceful and stiff. Despite his dearth of formal training, Blythe's proficiency as an artist grew throughout his adulthood. Blythe's early poetry was written in East Liverpool and is generally of a sentimental, simple nature. Adulthood Blythe's Man Eating in a Field, c. 1856‚Äì1863 Libby Prison, 1863 In the late 1840s Blythe moved from East Liverpool to Uniontown, Pennsylvania, probably due to his courtship of Julia Ann Keffer. The couple had been acquainted since the mid-1840s. Julia's family had relocated to Uniontown sometime around 1847. Julia and David were married in Pittsburgh's Roman Catholic cathedral on September 30, 1848 and set up residence in Uniontown. Blythe established a living as a portraitist in Uniontown, and a large number of his early portraits from that period survive. They are generally in the same stiff manner as his early East Liverpool portraits. In addition to painting, Blythe was commissioned to carve a large poplar (8'2\\") statue of Lafayette for the cupola of the Uniontown, Pennsylvania courthouse. Blythe also invested a great deal of time and energy in painting a panorama ‚Äî an early forerunner to motion pictures. Blythe's Great Panorama of the Allegheny Mountains was painted on a canvas roll seven feet tall and about 300 feet long. The panorama contained twenty or so scenes picturing eastern locales of aesthetic or historical importance, including Monticello, Fort Necessity, Harper's Ferry, General Braddock's grave, etc. Panoramas toured various cities and were displayed in rented halls. The canvas was mounted on rollers and each scene was displayed to the paying audience accompanied with narration, and sometimes with music. The subject matter was usually biblical, historical, or scenes of exotic foreign locales such as Egypt. Unfortunately, Blythe's prodigious labors on his panorama came to naught. Though Blythe traveled to exhibit his panorama in Baltimore, Pittsburgh, East Liverpool and a few other locales, it failed to attract interest sufficient to continue touring. Blythe dropped out of the ownership group after the first couple of performances and the panorama eventually disappeared. Between 1850 and 1852, Blythe suffered several profound losses in addition to failure of the panorama. Both his father and his wife Julia died. After another statue project in nearby Green County fell through, the Uniontown newspapers published Blythe poems in which he referred to Greene County as \\"a sow grown fat with buttermilk and meal.\\" A Greene County newspaper then published a retort by a local poet ‚Äî the son of the newspaper's publisher ‚Äî in which Blythe was named too much of a drunk to be worth anyone's attention. Blythe's impudent response was a letter in which he called the poet \\"pumpkin-headed\\" and his father \\"another growling, whining hound.\\" After his wife's death, Blythe left Uniontown and began a period of travels throughout the Mississippi River valley. By the mid-1850s, he had returned to East Liverpool. His work as both a painter and a poet had blossomed and grown significantly more confident and mature during this period, perhaps by viewing exhibitions of other painters' works and via heavy reading of English Romantic poets and American mainstays like Longfellow and Poe. The sophisticated group of portraits he produced in the East Liverpool area in these years were noticeably more polished than his early period work. He also wrote a large canon of poetry that was leagues ahead of his early work in its quality and distinctive voice. Around 1860, Blythe moved to Pittsburgh, the largest city and art market in the region. He turned away from poetry and portraiture and instead concentrated on canvases depicting hot-button social and political issues. Blythe opposed the expansion of both slavery and immigration, and made vigorous visual points regarding both issues in a number of singularly accomplished genre paintings. His work, in conjunction with his views, had become increasingly and bitingly satirical. Civil War Blythe painted \\"Lincoln Crushing the Dragon of Rebellion\\" in 1862. This piece depicts a fiery Abraham Lincoln in the center of the canvas, straining forward to crush rebellion (depicted as an alligator or crocodile) while in the background, a huge fire rages. Blythe did not serve in the military during the Civil War. He did follow a regiment in hopes of making sketches to use later as studies for paintings of battle. Although he did not personally witness combat, Blythe gained enough of a sense of the cruelties of war that he was emboldened to paint several powerful pieces. Of these, the most famous is \\"Libby Prison,\\" which Blythe painted in 1863. It depicts Union soldiers suffering intensely in captivity in the south. It is generally considered to be one of the most gruesome of all American paintings of Civil War scenes. Later work Many of Blythe's most accomplished paintings offer barbed commentary on the American judicial system; politics; the pretensions of the burgeoning American middle class; and the daily activities of street urchins he encountered in Pittsburgh. His paintings of children are particularly notable for their distinct lack of sentimentality. Blythe's children generally exhibit a sharp intelligence and bold, cynical expressions. They are shown to be canny participants in the city's hustle-and-bustle: playing marbles for money, setting off firecrackers, picking pockets, smoking cigars, stealing eggs and indulging in other forms of hanky-panky. Blythe lived an archetypal \\"starving artist\\" existence in Pittsburgh, showing little interest in social relationships, his attire or personal hygiene, or the sales of his artwork. Blythe was an alcoholic throughout adulthood. On May 15, 1865, Blythe died of complications of alcoholism after being found unconscious in his garret in downtown Pittsburgh. Reputation Although Blythe was well-regarded in Pittsburgh during his final years, he did not enjoy a larger national reputation in his lifetime. For decades ‚Äî from his death until the 1940s ‚Äî Blythe's life and work were largely forgotten. Since the 1940s, however, his oeuvre has earned growing respect and prestige. His genre paintings are now in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; the Westmoreland Museum of American Art; the De Young Museum; the Butler Institute of American Art; and the Art Institute of Chicago among others. The largest collection of Blythe genre paintings (about two dozen) is owned by the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, followed by the ten owned by the private Duquesne Club in downtown Pittsburgh. The East Liverpool (OH) Historical Society owns a large collection of early Blythe portraits, and General LaFayette still stands in the rotunda of the Fayette County Courthouse in Uniontown. A small number of Blythe genre paintings are privately owned. The relative scarcity of his work usually results in high prices for the rare examples that come to auction. References *Bruce W.

Sun Aire served a number of cities in Southern California and Arizona. History Sun Aire Lines was founded as Borrego Springs Airlines in 1968. Its operations initially focused on providing air service into Borrego Springs, California via the Borrego Valley Airport from other destinations in southern California such as San Diego and Palm Springs. The airline later moved its headquarters to Palm Springs, California. Borrego Springs Airlines operated a small fleet of Cessna 402 prop aircraft and Swearingen Metro II turboprops before changing its name to Sun Aire. Its primary destinations were Palm Springs, San Diego, Los Angeles, Borrego Springs, Phoenix, Yuma, Santa Barbara and Santa Maria. By 1984, the airline was operating a dozen Metro II propjet aircraft. Sun Aire's independent existence ended that year after the company was purchased by SkyWest Airlines. The airline operated its final service on September 28, 1984. Destinations According to the route map in the Sun Aire system timetable dated January 23, 1984, the airline was serving the following destinations in Arizona and California: * Bakersfield, CA (BFL) * Borrego Springs, CA (BXS) * Burbank, CA (BUR, now Bob Hope Airport) * El Centro/Imperial, CA (IPL) * Los Angeles, CA (LAX) * Ontario, CA (ONT) * Palm Springs, CA (PSP) * Phoenix, AZ (PHX) * San Diego, CA (SAN) * Santa Barbara, CA (SBA) * Santa Maria, CA (SMX) * Yuma, AZ (YUM) Fleet At the time of its acquisition by SkyWest Airlines, Sun Aire was operating 19-passenger Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner \\"Metro II\\" commuter turboprop aircraft.

This type is especially used by Bayads, one of the Tribes of Mongolia. Naadam festival in Kharkhorin National costume A deel ( ; Buryat: –¥—ç–≥—ç–ª, ) is an item of traditional clothing commonly worn since centuries ago among the Mongols and other nomadic tribes of Central Asia, including various Turkic peoples, and can be made from cotton, silk, wool, or brocade. The deel is still commonly worn by both men and women outside major towns, especially by herders. In urban areas, deels are mostly only worn by elderly people, or on festive occasions. The deel appears similar to a caftan or an old European folded tunic. Deels typically reach to below the wearer's knees and fan out at the bottom and are commonly blue, olive, or burgundy, though there are deels in a variety of other colors. Description The deel looks like a large overcoat when not worn. Instead of buttoning together in the middle, the sides are pulled against the wearer's body, the right flap close to the body with the left covering. On the right side of the wearer are typically 5 or 6 clasps to hold the top flap in place. There is one clasp below the armpit, three at the shoulder, and either one or two at the neckline. A deel is traditionally worn with a large sash, usually made of silk or leather belts with large, ornate buckles have become more common in the modern era. The area between the flaps and above the belt creates a large pocket in which Mongolians keep many things, Mongolian men will occasionally even carry silver bowl or cup, snuff box in their deel. Though there is no major difference in material or outline between male and female deels, females tend to wear the \\"pocket\\" closer (that is, women often prefer a more snug-fitting deel), while males' may have both larger pockets, looser fit, and wider sleeves. In Mongolia, the usage of the word deel has been extended to cover other long winter coats as well. For example, fur and leather overcoats of western design are referred to as \\"nekhii deel\\" and \\"sawkhin deel\\", respectively, meaning \\"fur deel\\", \\"leather deel\\" and \\"cashmere deel\\", which is made of the luxurious material cashmere. Nevertheless, other Mongol regions, such as Bortala in Xinjiang retain the specific meaning of the word \\"deel\\" as the traditional garment, and refer to other overcoats as \\"olondoi\\". Types Deel design varies among cultures, ethnic groups and time periods to a certain degree. There are even distinct variations among different Mongol tribes mostly on the design of the upper chest opening edges. For instance the Khalkha Mongol deel opening edges are round while a Buryat deel's is square. It can also vary among other tribes such as Chakhar, Torguud, and Uzemchin. Deels are designed for different occasions and environments. The design also varies due to function. There are deels for ceremonies like weddings and holidays and deels for daily wear. Deels for special occasions have their outer layer made of silk while the common deels are usually made of wool, cotton and other relatively inexpensive materials.

The Yadkin Valley Railroad is the trade name of the Piedmont and Atlantic Railroad and is a shortline railroad operating two lines leased from the Norfolk Southern Railway originating out of Rural Hall, North Carolina for a distance of . The railroad began operation in 1989 and is currently a subsidiary of Gulf and Ohio Railways. Primary commodities include poultry feed ingredients, wood products, steel, plastics, propane, ethanol, and rail car storage, amounting to approximately 12,700 annual carloads. History Two separate lines comprise the Yadkin Valley railroad, both originating out of Rural Hall. The first runs to North Wilkesboro and was completed by the North Western North Carolina Railroad on August 30, 1890, as part of the Richmond & Danville. The second line to Mount Airy was constructed by the Cape Fear & Yadkin Valley in June 1888. Both railroads were absorbed by the Southern prior to the turn of the century. The Yadkin Valley railroad began operations December 11, 1989, as a subsidiary of the Laurinburg & Southern under Norfolk Southern's Thoroughbred Shortline Program. Interchange is made with Norfolk Southern at Rural Hall. Control of the railroad was turned over to Gulf & Ohio on March 1, 1994. Recently acquired trackage rights allow the railroad access to Winston-Salem. As both lines were still leased from Norfolk Southern, the railroad sought to purchase both lines outright in 2009.

Essentially, aging-associated diseases are complications arising from senescence. Age-associated diseases are to be distinguished from the aging process itself because all adult animals age, save for a few rare exceptions, but not all adult animals experience all age-associated diseases. Aging- associated diseases do not refer to age-specific diseases, such as the childhood diseases chicken pox and measles. \\"Aging-associated disease\\" is used here to mean \\"diseases of the elderly\\". Nor should aging-associated diseases be confused with accelerated aging diseases, all of which are genetic disorders. Examples of aging-associated diseases are atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, cataracts, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. The incidence of all of these diseases increases exponentially with age. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds‚Äî100,000 per day‚Äîdie of age- related causes. In industrialized nations, the proportion is higher, reaching 90%. Patterns of differences By age 3 about 30% of rats have had cancer, whereas by age 85 about 30% of humans have had cancer. Humans, dogs and rabbits get Alzheimer's disease, but rodents do not. Elderly rodents typically die of cancer or kidney disease, but not of cardiovascular disease. In humans, the relative incidence of cancer increases exponentially with age for most cancers, but levels off or may even decline by age 60‚Äì75 (although colon/rectal cancer continues to increase). People with the so-called segmental progerias are vulnerable to different sets of diseases. Those with Werner's syndrome suffer from osteoporosis, cataracts, and cardiovascular disease, but not neurodegeneration or Alzheimer's disease; those with Down syndrome suffer type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, but not high blood pressure, osteoporosis or cataracts. In Bloom syndrome, those afflicted most often die of cancer. Research Aging (senescence) increases vulnerability to age-associated diseases, whereas genetics determines vulnerability or resistance between species and individuals within species. Some age-related changes (like graying hair) are said to be unrelated to an increase in mortality. But some biogerontologists believe that the same underlying changes that cause graying hair also increase mortality in other organ systems and that understanding the incidence of age-associated disease will advance knowledge of the biology of senescence just as knowledge of childhood diseases advanced knowledge of human development. Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) is a research strategy which aims to repair a few \\"root causes\\" for age-related illness and degeneration, as well as develop medical procedures to periodically repair all such damage in the human body, thereby maintaining a youth-like state indefinitely.\\"The SENS Platform: An Engineering Approach to Curing Aging\\". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on June 28, 2008. So far, the SENS programme has identified seven types of aging-related damage, and feasible solutions have been outlined for each. However, critics argue that the SENS agenda is optimistic at best, and that the aging process is too complex and little-understood for SENS to be scientific or implementable in the foreseeable future.de Grey, Aubrey. \\"The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS\\". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on July 1, 2008. It has been proposed that age-related diseases are mediated by vicious cycles.  Diseases = Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)  Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a disease that affects the eyes and can lead to vision loss through break down of the central part of the retina called the macula. Degeneration can occur in one eye or both and can be classified as either wet (neovascular) or dry (atrophic). Wet AMD commonly is caused by blood vessels near the retina that lead to swelling of the macula. The cause of dry AMD is less clear, but it is thought to be partly caused by breakdown of light-sensitive cells and tissue surrounding the macula. A major risk factor for AMD is age over the age of 60.  Alzheimer's disease  Alzheimer's disease is classified as a \\"protein misfolding\\" disease. Aging causes mutations in protein folding, and as a result causes deposits of abnormal modified proteins accumulate in specific areas of the brain. In Alzheimer's,deposits of Beta-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau protein form extracellular plaques and extracellular tangles. These deposits are shown to be neurotoxic and cause cognitive impairment due to their initiation of destructive biochemical pathways.  Atherosclerosis  Atherosclerosis is categorized as an aging disease and is brought about by vascular remodeling, the accumulation of plaque, and the loss of arterial elasticity. Over time, these processes can stiffen the vasculature. For these reasons, older age is listed as a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Specifically, the risk of atherosclerosis increases for men above 45 years of age and women above 55 years of age.  Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)  Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland due to increased growth. An enlarged prostate can result in incomplete or complete blockage of the bladder and interferes with a man's ability to urinate properly. Symptoms include overactive bladder, decreased stream of urine, hesitancy urinating, and incomplete emptying of the bladder. By age 40, 10% of men will have signs of BPH and by age 60, this percentage increases by 5 fold. Men over the age of 80 have over a 90% chance of developing BPH and almost 80% of men will develop BPH in their lifetime. Cancer Although it is possible for cancer to strike at any age, most patients with invasive cancer are over 65, and the most significant risk factor for developing cancer is age.According to cancer researcher Robert A. Weinberg, \\"If we lived long enough, sooner or later we all would get cancer.\\" Some of the association between aging and cancer is attributed to immunosenescence, errors accumulated in DNA over a lifetime and age-related changes in the endocrine system. Aging's effect on cancer is complicated by factors such as DNA damage and inflammation promoting it and factors such as vascular aging and endocrine changes inhibiting it. Stroke Stroke was the second most frequent cause of death worldwide in 2011, accounting for 6.2 million deaths (~11% of the total). Stroke could occur at any age, including in childhold, the risk of stroke increases exponentially from 30 years of age, and the cause varies by age. Advanced age is one of the most significant stroke risk factors. 95% of strokes occur in people age 45 and older, and two-thirds of strokes occur in those over the age of 65. A person's risk of dying if he or she does have a stroke also increases with age.

It was co-produced with France. The film was entered into the 16th Berlin International Film Festival. Plot Efisio Mulas is a meek laborer who lives with occasional work, especially in Don Leandro Sanna's salon, and rounds up the slim balance by betting with colleagues in strength with the game \\"head against head\\". In the village the Sanna and Porcu families' conflict has lasted over a century. The normality of the events is broken by the release, for the amnesty wanted by the pope, of the beautiful Domenicangela Piras, the turbulent girlfriend of Efisio convicted for having hurt him with a billhook. At the same time the old man of honor, Agostino Sanna, is about to instigate his nephew Don Leandro to kill Alvaro Porcu. Don Leandro does not intend to support his uncle, so it takes time, insinuating that Alvaro Porcu has been hiding in Supramonte for fear of him. Efisio marries Domenicangela having, finally, obtained the consent of her father required by the priest, the fugitive don Liberato. Meanwhile, Agostino Sanna decides to haunt down Alvaro to kill him, but succumbs. Leandro, walking to stop his uncle, attends to his death, and, disgusted, to avoid the continuation of the vendetta, decides to move into his estate, seeking for peace. Efisio needs money and decides to steal sheep from the estate, but the watchdog pulls him out of his pants. During the wedding celebrations of Efisio and Domenicangela, she gets rid of those pants, throwing them in the street. The marshal of the carabinieri find them, and, having seen the bites of the dog and the blood left on them, immediately arrests him. Efisio runs away and decides to flee in Milan. Meanwhile, a new event is about to reopen the vendetta: Giovanni Sanna, Leandro's younger brother, challenges on public square Alvaro Porcu to take revenge for Uncle Agostino, hitting his face with a glove. Don Leandro is furious, because at this point he is under threat from the revenge of Egidio Porcu, brother of Alvaro and the last surviving adult male of the family. The family risks to remain with no males. He proposes then an exchange to Efisio: he will return to Sardinia to kill Egidio Porcu, and Don Leandro, in return, will witness his innocence in the murder of Uncle Agostino. Efisio agrees, but he is incapable of killing, and, when he is back in Sardinia decides to meet his wife only. At the same time Egidio Porcu is killed by an unknown hand. At Efisio's trial, he is declared not guilty and then he can return in his village as a free man, but he finds a hostile atmosphere. Dominicangela, in fact, is pregnant and everyone is questioning the identity of the father. For Efisio there is then a tragic dilemma: to reveal that he is the father of the about to be born (and confess his presence in the village on the day of the murder of Egidio Porcu) or undergo social stigmatization. When Don Leandro turns his back on him, Efisio turns to Don Liberato, who makes him understanding the name of the true assassin of Egidio Porcu. Efisio then attempts to involve a young carabiniere to make him witness the man's confession, and, during a country party, tries to tease him. But precisely at the crucial moment, the assassin of Egidio Porcu expresses itself in Sardinian. The carabiniere does not understand a word, and immediately after, the murder is killed by a rival. Efisio has no option than killing the innocent Domenicangela and end up in jail. Only in this way it is possible to end this endless conflict between families and regain the respect of the people of his village. The film ends with the sad imprisonment of Efisio with the people of his village paying him the so sought-after respect.

Standing approximately 18‚Äì25 feet tall, the first figure was a Paul Bunyan character designed to hold an axe.Roadside America. \\"Origin of the Species\\", Roadside America website, 2009. Accessed 2009-09-15. Derivatives of that figure were widely used to hold full-sized car mufflers, tires, or other items promoting various roadside businesses. International Fiberglass of Venice, California constructed most Muffler Men. While the fiberglass figures are no longer manufactured, many still exist throughout a number of states across the United States with some also in Canada. At least four remain on U.S. Route 66, including Chicken Boy and Gemini Giant. Muffler Men have made appearances as characters in the comic strip \\"Zippy the Pinhead\\" by Bill Griffith, often in conversation with Zippy. Two books have been devoted to the distinctive roadside figures and the July 2012 issue of AAA New Mexico Journey devoted its front cover to their 50th anniversary. History Paul Bunyan Muffler Man in Rocky Mount, North Carolina The Gemini Giant at the Launching Pad, a drive-in restaurant in Illinois Boatbuilder Steve Dashew established International Fiberglass in 1963 by purchasing and renaming Bob Prewitt's workshop, Prewitt Fiberglass. The oversized fibreglass men, women and dinosaurs began as a sideline. The first of the figures, a Paul Bunyan holding an oversized axe to promote a restaurant, was created by Bob Prewitt in 1962 for the Paul Bunyan Caf√© on Route 66 in Flagstaff, Arizona. As the fibreglass moulds for this initial figure existed when Dashew acquired the company, similar characters could be readily created by keeping the same basic characteristics (such as the right palm up, left palm down position in which the original Bunyan lumberjack figure held his axe) with minor variation. Various fibreglass moulds allowed different heads, limbs or torsos to be substituted to create multiple variant characters. Some would promote food, others automotive products. A fifteen- foot Amish man standing over a diner in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and a Uniroyal gal in a skirt or bikini were among the many variants. Thousands of the oversize figures would be deployed in a little over a decade at a typical cost of $1000-$2800 each. Some would be customised as promotions of individual roadside businesses on the US Highway system. Many were created to advertise franchise and chain brands, such as the Enco and Humble tigers and the Philips Petroleum cowboys. A novelty fibreglass dinosaur figure was most often seen promoting Sinclair Oil stations, but also appeared at various miniature golf courses. When businesses closed or were sold, often the figures would be repainted and adapted to represent different characters or were relocated. The statues have become natives, Vikings, football players and sports mascots, country bumpkins, cooks and chefs, cowboys, soldiers, sea pirates and astronauts. The use of roadside novelties represented a means for independent businesses to differentiate themselves in an era before two-lane highways were bypassed by freeways; businesses located directly on the main road would rely heavily on neon signage, promotional displays and gimmicks to make themselves more visible to passing motorists. Increases in costs to deliver the lightweight but oversized figures proved problematic and business declined with the 1973 oil crisis. International Fibreglass was sold and closed permanently in 1976. The moulds for the figures, originally worth thousands of dollars each, were not retained and are now lost. Many of the characters, such as a Texaco Big Friend initially created for a cancelled service station chain promotion, would become rare after International Fiberglass ceased operations.

The film also stars Michael Parks and William R. Moses. Plot 14-year-old Ellie Christianson lives in an affluent neighborhood with her parents, Karen and Ben, and younger sister, Inger. Beneath their privileged lifestyle is one tinged with dysfunction and chaos. Ben is a workaholic with a hectic schedule that keeps him away from home for most of the day. Karen, meanwhile, passes the time by pursuing an illicit affair with the family's next door neighbor, Lawson Smith, while her daughters are getting ready for school. She impulsively fires Lena Anderson, her housekeeper, as a means to spending some free time with Lawson, and is completely unaware that a shocked Ellie has secretly witnessed one of their liaisons. Karen has an ongoing tumultuous relationship with Ellie, culminating in a heated confrontation one day after the older daughter disobeys an order to not wear too much makeup at school. Ellie ends up remorselessly killing her mother in a fit of rage. She selfishly begins to assume her wifely duties to Ben by waiting for him in bed at night, dressed only in lingerie. However, Ben gradually develops some romantic feelings for the former housekeeper, Lena, and they eventually marry. The impromptu wedding ceremony ignites feelings of jealousy for Ellie as she wanted all along to be his wife. While the supposed \\"love triangle\\" is playing out in Ellie's twisted mind, her mother's tragic \\"accident\\" is investigated by Detective Boland. When Karen's \\"accident\\" is subsequently ruled as a murder, he names Ellie as the prime suspect. She immediately decides to run away from home, going to Portland with her dead mother's lover, Lawson, in tow. After her family goes on an hours-long fruitless search for Ellie, she unexpectedly returns to the house. She is greeted by Inger, who knows full well what had really happened to her mother. Inger ends up murdering Ellie, essentially inheriting her \\"wicked\\" nature. Cast * Julia Stiles as Ellie Christianson * Michael Parks as Detective Boland * William R.

The BSEL portfolio provides a wide range of Bachelor's and Master's programmes in fields such as business, administration for the public and private sector, public security, law, or engineering. BSEL has an international approach with close working relationships to over 150 partner universities all over the world. The school offers a 5-year dual degree with France's ESCE International Business School in Paris, enabling selected bilingual students to have the \\"Master in Management\\" from ESCE and the Master of Arts from HWR Berlin. This program is supported by the Franco- German University (FGU).  Accreditations  BSEL is AMBA accredited and member of the EFMD, the AACSB as well as the UAS7 Alliance for Excellence, a strategic alliance of seven leading German universities. The BSEL Campus Locations The Berlin School of Economics and Law (BSEL) has two campuses. The main campus is located in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg and is home to the University administration, the Faculty of Business and Economics and the BPS Berlin Professional School. The campus with the Faculty of Company-Linked Programmes, Faculty of Administration and Law, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Police Training and Management and the Institute for Distance Learning is part of the educational complex in Berlin-Lichtenberg. International Affairs The Berlin School of Economics and Law encourages the internationalization of its students through its more than 150 partner universities throughout the world, e.g. in Italy, Australia, the Netherlands, Great Britain, France, India, Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, the United States and Hong Kong. Faculties and Central Institutes=Department of Business and Economics The Department of Business and Economics (Department 1) offers eight Bachelor programmes which usually combine a focus on business and economics with a wider integrative and interdisciplinary perspective. The inclusion of gender studies and environmental and sustainability issues are also important features of some of the programmes. Whilst all programmes have certain international components three of the programmes are entirely international either in the form of a bi-national dual degree course or by being taught in English and by including compulsory study abroad periods. The Master-of-Arts programmes of the faculty are run in English or in English and French. Department of Cooperative Studies The Department of Cooperative Studies (Department 2) offers a total of 16 sector-oriented bachelor programmes with business and technical specializations and two Master programmes. The unique feature of these programmes is the combination of theory-based teaching phases and on the job-training phases. The programmes are run in close co-operation with 700 partner companies which are also involved in programme development. After three years of studies, the students obtain their Bachelor‚Äòs degree and are usually offered a position by their respective training company. Department of Public Administration The Department of Public Administration (Department 3) comprises the Berlin School of Public Administration and the Berlin School of Law. The faculty conducts research in fields such as public management, non-profit management, organization theory, public organizational behavior, public change management, and broad scope of administrative and legal issues from a European and internationally comparative perspective. Department of Legal Studies In the Department of Legal Studies (Department 4) prospective court officials and registrars study in an ‚Äúinternal‚Äù diploma programme for the wide range of legal tasks they will be entrusted with by the court and public prosecutors‚Äô offices in the L√§nder of Berlin, Brandenburg and Sachsen-Anhalt. The Department of Legal Studies also offers a Bachelor of Laws degree in Commercial Law. This programme combines special legal expertise (including real estate law, property and real estate law of enforcement, insolvency law, mercantile, corporate and registry law) with business subjects, especially those in business administration. In addition, the Department of Legal Studies teaches the main degree course for the higher levels of the foreign service and offers LL.M. in \\"Guardian and Custodian\\" as well as in \\"Real Estate Law and Law of Execution\\". Department of Police and Security Management The Department of Police and Security Management (Department 5) provides a range of Bachelors‚Äô and master's degree programmes which cover local, company and private sector security. This includes a police management degree programme, the graduation in which is the basic entry requirement for higher career levels in the Berlin Police Force. All the degree programmes have a practical and interdisciplinary focus, and cover topics from the Legal, Policing, Social and Economic Sciences. BPS Berlin Professional School The Berlin School of Economics was among the first business schools in Germany to offer MBA-programmes through its Berlin Professional School (formerly known as Institute of Management Berlin (IMB)) and can look back on 15 years of experience in this field. The BPS‚Äôs core competence is the MBA programme, and especially MBAs with different key themes. The five accredited MBA programmes of the BPS aim to prepare graduates ‚Äì with various foci ‚Äì for leading positions in general management of businesses or in the healthcare sector. The BPS offers also three M.A. programmes and one certificate programme. In 2013 the BPS Berlin Professional School has been granted accreditation for its MBA provision by the Association of MBAs (AMBA). The Berlin School of Economics is hence the fourth business school in Germany to have been accredited by the organization. The BPS also concentrates the e-learning programmes of the BSEL. The institute offers part- time study programmes specializing in administrative and security management. The institute's portfolio includes three courses of study leading to a master's degree: a Master of European Administrative Management, a Master of Public Administration, and a Master of Security Management. In addition, the institute offers a BA programme in Public Administration. The Institute now also offers Master of Science (M.Sc.) in International Business Management. Institute for Co-operation with Central and Eastern European Countries in Public Reform (IMO) The Institute for Co-operation with Central and Eastern European Countries in Public Reform (IMO) is an interdisciplinary center of competence for development and consultancy projects in the areas of modernizing public administration and reforming police in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The tasks of the institute include Central and Eastern European research as well as the design, the organization and the implementation of international study curricula and further training courses in the context of the EU Lifelong Learning programme. Another important objective is the establishment and the support of scientific networks and mobility-enhancing co-operations.

A photoinitiator is a molecule that creates reactive species (free radicals, cations or anions) when exposed to radiation (UV or visible). Synthetic photoinitiators are key components in photopolymers (i.e., photo-curable coatings, adhesives and dental restoratives). Some small molecules in the atmosphere can also act as photoinitiators by decomposing to give free radicals (in photochemical smog). For instance, nitrogen dioxide is produced in large quantities by gasoline-burning internal combustion engines. NO2 in the troposphere gives smog its brown coloration and catalyzes production of toxic ground-level ozone. Molecular oxygen (O2) also serves as a photoinitiator in the stratosphere, breaking down into atomic oxygen and combining with O2 in order to form the ozone in the ozone layer. Reactions Photoinitators can create reactive species by different pathways including photodissociation and electron transfer. As an example of dissociation, hydrogen peroxide can undergo homolytic cleavage, with the O-O bond cleaving to form two hydroxyl radicals. :H2O2 ‚Üí 2 ¬∑OH Certain azo compounds (such as azobisisobutyronitrile), can also photolytically cleave, forming two alkyl radicals and nitrogen gas: :RCH2-N=N-H2CR ‚Üí 2 RCH2 \\\\+ N2 These free radicals can now promote other reactions. Atmospheric photoinitiators= Peroxides Hydrogen peroxide, the simplest peroxide Since molecular oxygen can abstract H atoms from certain radicals, the HOO¬∑ radical is easily created. This particular radical can further abstract H atoms, creating H2O2, or hydrogen peroxide; peroxides can further cleave photolytically into two hydroxyl radicals. More commonly, HOO can react with free oxygen atoms to yield a hydroxy radical (¬∑OH) and oxygen gas. In both cases, the ¬∑OH radicals formed can serve to oxidize organic compounds in the atmosphere.vanLoon, pp. 52‚Äì53 :H2O2 ‚Üí 2 ¬∑OH :HOO¬∑ + O ‚Üí O2 \\\\+ ¬∑OH :¬∑OH + CH4 ‚Üí ¬∑CH3 \\\\+ H2O Nitrogen dioxide Nitrogen dioxide, a large contributor to the production of smog Nitrogen dioxide can also be photolytically cleaved by photons of wavelength less than 400 nmvanLoon, pp. 74‚Äì79 producing atomic oxygen and nitric oxide. :NO2 ‚Üí NO + O Atomic oxygen is a highly reactive species, and can abstract a H atom from anything, including water. :O + H2O ‚Üí 2 ¬∑OH Nitrogen dioxide can be regenerated through a reaction between certain peroxy-containing radicals and NO. :ROO¬∑ + NO ‚Üí NO2 \\\\+ RO¬∑ Molecular oxygen In the stratosphere, molecular oxygen (O2) is an important photoinitiator that begins the ozone- production process in the ozone layer.

Commercial photoinitiators and uses=AIBN Azobisisobutyronitrile, a commonly used industrial photoinitiator, and its breakdown into two radicals and nitrogen gas Azobisisobutyronitrile is a white powder often used as a photoinitiator for vinyl-based polymers such as polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC. Because this particular photoinitiator produces nitrogen gas (N2) upon decomposition, it is often used as a blowing agent to change the shape and/or texture of plastics. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide, a common photoinitiator used in plastics production and in acne medication Benzoyl peroxide, much like azobisisobutyronitrile, is a white powder used as a photoinitiator in various commercial and industrial processes, including plastics production. Unlike AIBN, however, benzoyl peroxide produces oxygen gas upon decomposing, giving this compound a host of medical uses as well.\\"Benzoyl Peroxide\\", chemicalland21.com, accessed October 29, 2009 Upon contact with the skin, benzoyl peroxide breaks down, producing oxygen gas, among other things. The oxygen gas is absorbed into the pores of the skin, where it kills off the acne-causing bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. In addition, the free radicals produced can break down dead skin cells. Clearing out these dead cells prevents pore blockage and, by extension, acne breakouts.\\"Benzoyl Peroxide\\" , http://www.about.com, accessed October 29, 2009 example of acrylate polymerization via radical photoinitiation.

History The curved, Gothic-hilted 1822 and 1845 pattern infantry swords, although elegant, had been criticised by some as fighting swords. In common with British cavalry swords of the era, they were cut-and-thrust swords. In 1892, a new, straight, blade was introduced, mated to the existing Gothic hilt. Presaging the introduction of the 1908 pattern cavalry sword, the curved blade was abandoned in favour of a straight, stiff blade optimized for the thrust. Credit for the design has been given to Colonel G.M. Fox, chief inspector of physical training at the board of education, who was also influential in the design of the pattern 1908 cavalry sword.Ffoulkes, Hopkinson, p.25 In 1895, a new pierced steel hilt pattern was introduced, replacing the earlier Gothic hilt with a three-quarter basket hilt. The new pattern was short-lived due to the edge of the guard fraying uniforms, and in 1897 the final pattern was settled on, being simply the 1895 pattern with the inner edge of the guard turned down, and the piercings becoming smaller. By the time of its introduction, the sword was of limited use on the battlefield against rapid- firing rifles, machine guns and long-range artillery. However, the new sword was regarded, when needed, as a very effective fighting weapon. Reports from the Sudan, where it was used in close-quarters fighting during the reconquest of the Sudan (1896-'99) were positive. Officers carried swords into battle in 1914 at the start of the First World War, and some were still being used in action at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915. That June, Army Order 68 prohibited the carrying of swords by infantry on the battlefields of the European theater of the war, in an effort to prevent officers making themselves conspicuous to the enemy; however, at least one sword was carried in the assault on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in June 1916. Bernard Montgomery advanced with his 1897 pattern sword drawn during a counteroffensive in October 1914; having never received any training on how to use it. The actual sword he carried is exhibited in the Imperial War Museum, London. The design of the 1897 pattern has remained unchanged to the present day, and is now manufactured by various companies, including Weyersberg, Kirschbaum & Cie of Germany and Pooley Sword of the UK. Until 2004, swords of this pattern would be used in courts-martial by escorts of the accused and if the accused was an officer, he'd lay his sword on the table for judgement. Design The blade is described in the pattern as being long and wide at the shoulder, with the complete sword weighing between 1 lb 12oz and 1 lb 13 oz (794-822g). The blade is straight and appears symmetrical in shape (though in cross-section is a wedge, with the edge towards the front). The thick blade has a deep central fuller on each side and is rounded on both its edge and back towards the hilt, giving a ‚Äúdumbbell‚Äù or ‚Äúgirder‚Äù cross section. Through a gradual transition, the blade becomes a wedge-section with the main cutting edge towards the front. The last of the front edge was sharpened when on active service (and a few inches of the false edge, at the back near the tip, to aid penetration). The blade ends in a sharp stiff spear point. The blade is usually decoratively etched on both sides. The guard is a three-quarter basket of sheet steel. It is decorated with a pierced scroll-work pattern and (usually, see variation, below) has the royal cypher of the reigning monarch set over the lower knuckle bow. The grip, between 5 and 5 ¬æ inches (127-146mm) long to suit the hand of the owner, was generally covered in ray or sharkskin and wrapped with German-silver wire. The grip is straight, with no offset to the blade. The sword shows a number of features that indicate its intent as a thrusting weapon. The stiff tapering narrow point aids penetration. The blade, whilst quite narrow, is thick and its dumbbell section gives it good weak-axis buckling strength whilst maintaining robustness in bending for the parry. The blade tapers in both width and thickness and, with the substantial guard, has a hilt-biased balance, aiding agility at the expense of concussive force in a cut. The guard gives comprehensive protection to the hand, but does not restrict wrist movement. The length of the front edge, at , is quite significant, suggesting that some cutting capability was maintained, even if the blade design is clearly intended as a thruster. Variations In common with earlier patterns, the 1897 pattern was sometime produced in ‚Äúpicquet‚Äù weight, i.e., a lighter weapon with a narrower blade and correspondingly scaled-down guard for use in lev√©es and other formal occasions when not on active service. Some regiments carried variations on the standard pattern, generally consisting of variations of the royal cypher on the guard. An unetched blade variant is available for warrant officers. The sword pattern also influenced the ceremonial sword used by the Hong Kong Police Force's Ceremonial uniform as well as the 1897 Canadian Infantry Sword used by the Canadian Army.

It is now associated with the nocturnal aerial displays made by Coenocorypha snipe. Mythology In MƒÅori mythology the Hakawai was one of eleven tapu (sacred) birds of Raka-maomao, a god of wind. The Hakawai lived in the heavens and only descended to the earth at night. It was considered to be a gigantic bird of prey and was described (as the Hokioi) by a NgƒÅti Apa chief, to the Governor of New Zealand Sir George Grey, as: Hearing the Hakawai was considered to be a bad omen, traditionally presaging war. Ornithologists in New Zealand have wondered whether the myth related to a real bird, whether extinct or still living, with some claiming that the myth may refer to the extinct Haast's eagle (Hieraaetus moorei). Although mention of the Hakawai occurred in MƒÅori mythology throughout New Zealand, since European settlement of the main islands direct experience of the Hakawai ‚Äì through hearing the sounds it made ‚Äì was largely restricted to the Muttonbird Islands, several small islands in the vicinity of Foveaux Strait and Stewart Island, in the far south of New Zealand. The Muttonbird Islands have no permanent human residents but are visited seasonally, from mid-March to the end of May, for muttonbirding ‚Äì the harvesting of sooty shearwater chicks for food and oil. There the sound ascribed to the Hakawai was described as having two main components, the first part being vocal, a call rendered as hakwai, hakwai, hakwai, followed by a non-vocal roar as of an object travelling through the air at high speed. It was heard on calm, moonlit nights and appeared to come from a great height.Miskelly (1987). Investigation During the 1980s ornithologist Dr Colin Miskelly, who was studying the New Zealand snipe genus Coenocorypha, after hearing and recording the aerial display of the Chatham snipe (C. pusilla), investigated the possibility that the sounds attributed to the Hakawai in the Muttonbird Islands were made by the recently extinct South Island snipe (Coenocorypha iredalei), then usually called the Stewart Island snipe and considered to be a subspecies of the subantarctic snipe (Coenocorypha aucklandica), a small, unobtrusive, brown bird some 21‚Äì24 cm in length. Miskelly interviewed several muttonbirders who had memories of hearing the distinctive sounds of the Hakawai. He found that its apparent range had steadily decreased over the years to the early 1960s when it was heard no more. The non-vocal sounds made by the Hakawai were described variously as \\"a sound as if a cable chain was lowered into a boat\\" a \\"jet-stream\\", a \\"blind rolling itself up\\" or \\"a shell passing overhead\\". The reaction to the sounds by those who heard it was generally one of fright. The decrease towards extinction paralleled that of the South Island snipe, of which the Muttonbird Islands were the final refuge, with the islands being progressively occupied by rats, feral cats and weka. The last known individuals of the snipe died in 1964 on Big South Cape Island following the accidental introduction of black rats there. Snipe in the genera Gallinago and Lymnocryptes, as well as the closely related woodcocks Scolopax, make courtship display flights, at dusk and on moonlit nights, producing mechanical sounds called \\"drumming\\", \\"bleating\\" or \\"winnowing\\", through the vibration of their modified outer tail feathers caused by the rush of air in the course of a power dive. Of his research in the Chatham Islands Miskelly wrote: and: Examination of museum skins from bird collections showed such characteristic wear of the tail feathers on male snipe from the Chatham Islands (C. pusilla), islands off Stewart Island (C. iredalei), the Auckland Islands (C. aucklandica aucklandica), and the Antipodes Islands (C. a. meinertzhagenae). Since then the same kind of tail-feather wear has been found on snipe from the Snares Islands (C. huegeli),Charteris & Miskelly (2005). and Hakawai displays have been heard in the Auckland and Antipodes Islands, as well as from the newly described Campbell snipe (C. a. perseverance) on Campbell Island.Miskelly et al.

Plot summary The film portrays the corrupt administration of an Apulia town during the fascist regime of 1937, after it has learned, in a roundabout way, of a pending anonymous visit of a government inspector from Rome. The inspector will determine if the administration adhered to the government's strict guidelines for economic and social planning. The threat of the inspection creates terror in the administrators, who fear their misdeeds will be revealed. Most fearful are those guilty of enriching themselves from public funds, and other abuses. They resort to pathetic staged measures to make it appear that they remained \\"honest administrators\\" and \\"good fascists\\". An unsuspecting insurer, Romeo Battifiori, arrives in town and is mistaken for the inspector. He is made the object of every honour and, of course, is utterly deceived.

It extends south as far as northern parts of Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Uganda and north-west Kenya. It is found in open country with rocks and short grass and is often seen on burnt ground. Some birds are resident but others make migratory movements. Habits Heuglin's wheatear feeds mainly on insects. It wags its tail and spreads its tail when displaying. Rather shy and in the breeding season usually seen in pairs, small groups recorded in winter. Taxonomy and naming It was formerly classified as a subspecies of red- breasted wheatear (O. bottae) of the Ethiopian Highlands and Arabia but is now usually regarded as a separate species due to differences in size, habitat and behaviour.

Description  Several elements of body armour (body cuirass, shoulder guards, breast plates and lower protection plates) from the late Mycenaean period have been found at Thebes, some bronze bands have been also found at Mycenae and Phaistos.One from the Late Geometric Period, found at Argos, is dated to the eighth century BC. Bronze scales were found at Mycenae and Troy; scale armour, the oldest form of metal body armor, was used widely throughout the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East. In May 1960Cynthia King, \\"The Homeric Corslet\\" American Journal of Archaeology 74.3 1970:294-96 Swedish archaeologists discovered the earliest example of a beaten bronze cuirass at Dendra, dated to the end of the fifteenth century BC.Isolated bronze shoulder pieces and apron plates are known from Dendra, Thebes and Phaistos in Crete: they \\"extend the chronological range of the Dendra type back to 1450 and forward to 1350\\", according to King 1970. It forms part of the Late Helladic (LHIIIa) Dendra Panoply, which consists of fifteen separate pieces of bronze sheet, held together with leather thongs, that encased the wearer from neck to knees.Dendra panoply: illustration ; Dendra panoply modern reconstruction ; modern recreation The panoply includes both greaves and lower arm-guards. The arm-guard is unique but greaves, probably made of linen, are often depicted in late Mycenaean art. The few bronze examples that have been found only covered the shins and may have been worn over linen ones, as much for show of status Diane Fortenberry has suggested,Fortenberry, \\"Single Greaves in the Late Helladic Period\\" American Journal of Archaeology 95.4 (October 1991:623-627). as for protection. Although we have only this one complete panoply to date, armor of similar type appears as an ideogram on Linear B tablets from Knossos (Sc series), Pylos (Sh series) and Tiryns (Si series).M. Snodgrass, \\"The Linear B Arms and Armour Tablets‚Äî Again, Kadmos 4 (1965:97-98). The panoply‚Äôs cuirass consists of two pieces, for the chest and back. These are joined on the left side by a hinge. There is a bronze loop on the right side of the front-plate and a similar loop on each shoulder. Large shoulder-guards fit over the cuirass. Two triangular plates are attached to the shoulder-guards and gave protection to the wearer‚Äôs armpits when his arms were in the raised position. There is also a deep neck-guard. The Linear B ideogram depicting armour of this type makes the neck-guard clearly discernible, and protection by a high bronze collar was a typical feature of Near Eastern body armour. Three pairs of curved plates hang from the waist to protect the groin and the thighs. All these pieces are made of beaten bronze sheet and are backed with leather and loosely fastened by ox-hide thongs to allow some degree of movement. The complete panoply thus forms a cumbersome tubular suit of armour, which fully protects the neck and torso, and extends down to the knees. It appears that lower arm-guards and a set of greaves further protected the warrior, all made of bronze, as fragments of these were also found in the grave at Dendra. Slivers of boars‚Äô tusks were also discovered, which once made up a boars‚Äô-tusk helmet. The figures on the Warrior Vase (Mycenae, ca 1200 BC, National Archaeological Museum, Athens)Illustration. are wearing body armor. However, this armor is different. It may be either an embossed waist-length leather corslet with a fringed leather apron that reaches to mid-thigh and possible shoulder-guards, very much like that worn by the Peoples of the Sea depicted on the mortuary temple of Ramesses III (died c. 1155 BC) at Medinet Habu, Lower Egypt, or, alternatively, the body armour may be a ‚Äòbell‚Äô corselet of beaten bronze sheet, a type also found in central Europe at that time.

She was an active promoter of Filipino cuisine, especially through the restaurant chain she founded, The Aristocrat. Early life She was born Engracia Cruz to a poor family in Navotas in 1892. Her mother was a street peddler who sold food sauces and fruits, and who later managed a small neighborhood eatery popularly known in the Philippines as carinderias . She developed her cooking skills at a young age, having to prepare the meals for her five younger siblings while her parents were out working for a living. She was able to complete only four years of primary education.Filipinos in History Vol. III, p. 228 In 1912, she married a young lawyer from her hometown, Alexander Reyes, who in 1948 would be appointed as an Associate Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court. The Aristocrat restaurant To augment her family's income as her husband struggled to establish his legal practice, Cruz-Reyes set up in 1928 a small carinderia at Calle de Marques de Comillas in Ermita, Manila. She named her eatery Lapu-Lapu (after the famed Mactan chieftain who defeated Ferdinand Magellan in battle), adopted a native motif as interior decor, and served primarily Filipino fare. These nationalistic manifestations especially stood out considering that the Philippines was then under American colonial rule. By the 1930s, Cruz-Reyes was selling adobo sandwiches at the Luneta out of a car loaned to her by a future son-in- law.Filipinos in History Vol. III, p. 229 Her reputation as a cook had also grown due to the home dinners she had cooked for many of the leading political figures of the day, friends of her now-prominent husband. By 1936, Cruz-Reyes operated a rolling store ‚Äî a mobile restaurant featuring a menu stacked with traditional Filipino dishes ‚Äî which she named \\"The Aristocrat\\". The first Aristocrat restaurant operated out a Studebaker van. Within two years, Cruz- Reyes opened a permanent restaurant at Dewey Boulevard in Manila. It remains open as of 2018, one of the oldest restaurants in Manila. The choice of name was ironic and pointed, for during that period, Filipino cuisine was not considered as appropriate fare in the homes of the Filipino elite. The restaurant was immediately successful, its original menu featuring adobo, a chicken sandwich, dinuguan and arroz caldo. By the 1950s, the menu had expanded to feature such present-day specialties such as chicken and pork barbecue skewers, Kare-Kare, Chicken Honey, Crispy Pata and even a variation on the adobo sandwiches Cruz-Reyes used to sell at the Luneta. The popularity of Aristocrat also helped usher a renewed popularity of Filipino cuisine as worthy \\"first-class\\" fare, a reputation Cruz-Reyes enhanced by her insistence of serving such dishes in the dinners she was often called to cater at Malaca√±an Palace. Honors and legacy Engracia Cruz-Reyes, The Aristocrat Restaurant since 1936 Cruz-Reyes is acknowledged as a pioneer in the Philippine food and restaurant industry. Her clan has remained active in the food industry, not only through The Aristocrat Restaurant, but in the manufacture of mass-market processed food products. One her daughters, Teresita, became the inspiration behind the Mama Sita's brand of condiments. In 2008, the family opened the Culinary Institute of Aristocrat, a cooking school.

Anzalone (born September 19, 1959), better known as Fireman Ed, is a superfan of the New York Jets. One of the most well-known National Football League fans, he has risen to prominence by appearing on many local radio shows. He was not the creator of the famous chant, \\"J-E-T-S, Jets!, Jets!, Jets!\\" which originally was led by two retired NYPD Jet fans ‚Äì alternating from one end zone to the other end zone, in the upper deck only. An actual New York City firefighter, Fireman Ed was injured on the job in 2007. During the butt fumble game, a rout of the Jets by the New England Patriots on Thanksgiving night 2012, Anzalone left the game before halftime, stating that he would no longer lead cheers at Jet games as Fireman Ed. At the first game of the 2015 NFL season, Fireman Ed returned to lead cheers for the Jets. Fandom Anzalone wears Bruce Harper's jersey to games, however he switched to Mark Sanchez's jersey for the 2012 NFL season in support of the quarterback, and has been leading the J-E-T-S chant from Section 134 of the Meadowlands since 1986. He used to be hoisted up on the shoulders of his brother Frank, then later onto those of Bruce Gregor after Frank developed knee problems. In 1999, Fireman Ed was included in an exhibit at the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the Hall of Fans. On September 25, 2009, Fireman Ed was given a game ball from the Jets Week 2 victory over the New England Patriots. On December 30, 2009, Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chad Johnson claimed he would imitate Fireman Ed if he scores a touchdown in his next game against the Jets, on January 3, 2010. The day after the Bengals' loss in Week 17, Johnson got in contact with Fireman Ed through Twitter and provided him with a VIP package for the Jets first round playoff game at Cincinnati, as a way to make up for the \\"trash-talking\\" that occurred before the game. Though he was appreciative of the offer he declined, on the moral ground that he did not think it was right to be flown out to the game by the opposing team. He did however say that if the Jets made him an offer he would take them up on it, though no offer was made. On November 22, 2012, during a Thanksgiving night Jets blowout 49‚Äì19 loss to the New England Patriots, Ed left the game at halftime and deleted his Twitter account.Notes:Where art Ed? Jane McManus, ESPN Retrieved November 23, 2012. He \\"retired\\" as the self- proclaimed mascot of the NY Jets, stating he will attend games but not in character. On September 13, 2015, Fireman Ed returned in character at the Jets' home opener against the Cleveland Browns. On September 8, 2019, Fireman Ed announced that he would return to leading the Jets Chant at home games for the 2019 season. Controversy On August 16, 2010, during a Monday Night Football Giants vs. Jets pre-season game, Fireman Ed's inaugural Jets chant in the New Meadowlands Stadium was interrupted by a Giants fan who raised his Giants hat while Fireman Ed's fellow Jets fans stood by. Fireman Ed repeatedly shoved the fan before the fan was escorted away from Ed's chanting post. The Giants fan was later removed from the game. Fireman Ed was charged with simple assault for the incident, but the charges were later dropped.

Biography √ûorvaldur was the son of the writer J√≥n Thoroddsen. He graduated from the Learned School of Reykjav√≠k in 1875 and then immediately proceeded to Copenhagen to further his studies. He studied natural history and zoology but also nourished a strong interest in geology; this was amplified in 1876 when he served as a guide for the geologist Johannes Frederik Johnstrup in an expedition to Iceland to study Askja and the volcanoes at M√Ωvatn.Hintze, p. 283. Unable to complete his studies for financial reasons √ûorvaldur accepted a teaching placement at M√∂√∞ruvellir in the north of Iceland in 1880 and worked there until 1885 when he became an adjunct at the Learned School. In 1887 he married √û√≥ra, daughter of bishop P√©tur P√©tursson.Hintze, p. 284. They had one child, Sigr√≠√∞ur (1888‚Äì1903). √û√≥ra died in 1917.Steind√≥r J. Erlingsson, page 1 (online edition). In 1899, √ûorvaldur resigned his position at the Learned School. The Althing granted him a generous pension which enabled him to live in Copenhagen and work on research and writing. In 1894, he was granted an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Copenhagen and in 1902 he was named Professor.Hintze, p. 285. Work During his expedition with Johnstrup, √ûorvaldur was stricken by the nature of Iceland's large uninhabited areas. He resolved to investigate the nature of the island, especially its geology which up till then had been sparsely mapped and studied.DBL 285. From 1881 to 1898 he undertook expeditions to gather data. During his work, √ûorvaldur ran into the limitations of the 1848 map of Iceland by Bj√∂rn Gunnlaugsson. Bj√∂rn had concentrated his precise measurements on the inhabited areas and a significant amount of work remained to be done in the central highlands. In 1901 √ûorvaldur published a geological map of Iceland, where he incorporated his corrections to Bj√∂rn Gunnlaugsson's map.J√∂kull S√¶varsson. During the time he lived in Copenhagen, √ûorvaldur wrote a number of books and articles on geology and geography, especially as regards Iceland.Sk√≥lavefurinn Initially he was a liberal evolutionist but his ideas on biology and politics changed greatly during his career and later in life he can be described as a very conservative anti-evolutionist. He was awarded the Charles P. Daly Medal by the American Geographical Society in 1906. He died in Copenhagen, aged 66. NotesReferences * Hintze, V. Thoroddsen, Thorvaldur entry in C. F.

It followed two collaborations by Moebius & Plank as a duo. Zero Set was recorded in September, 1982 at Conny's Studio outside Cologne, and released by Sky Records in 1983. The music on Zero Set is strongly influenced by African rhythms and music. One track, \\"Recall\\", features Sudanese vocals by Deuka. Matthew Weiner describes it for Soulmind Online: \\"Though not a dance record per se, Zero Set is one of the earliest extensions of Krautrock‚Äôs possibilities on the dance floor, pitting the profoundly electronic sequence patterns of Plank and Moebius against the hyperactive percussives of Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier. On tracks such as the prophetically titled 'Speed Display' and 'Pitch Control', the phasing, chattering and decidedly Germanic grooves found on Zero Set constitute vibrant proto-techno at its earliest and finest.\\" David Ross Smith, writing for Allmusic, describes the album: \\"...a highly percussive affair with Mani Neumeier. The album is saturated in drum and synth rhythms and polyrhythms, resulting in compositions that are energetic and infectious.\\" Zero Set was a turning point for Moebius and Plank, a fact lamented by Steven and Alan Freeman in their book The Crack In The Cosmic Egg. They say, in part: \\"...working with Mani Neumeier on Zero Set strangely took the music too close to techno for comfort...\\" Zero Set was reissued by the American Gyroscope label on CD on April 16, 1996.

He played as a wide midfielder. He has played at Under-15 and Under-20 levels for Canada. Background D'Agostino was born in Langley, British Columbia and attended Langley Secondary School. After highschool, he was offered a full scholarship to the University of Kentucky. In 2005, he was the Wildcats' leading scorer with three goals and eleven assists. During his youth and university years he played every position on the pitch except goalkeeper. Club career=Early career In 2006 D'Agostino played in the Pacific Coast Soccer League for Whitecaps FC Reserves with whom he won the championship. Blackpool After having trials in Italy with Reggina and Messina, he had trials in England with Leeds United and then Blackpool where he played in a Reserves match. D'Agostino signed a one-year contract in September 2007 with Blackpool with an option for an additional year. On 4 October 2007, Blackpool received international clearance for him to play for the club. Loan move to Cheltenham Town After playing a few games for the Blackpool reserves team, Blackpool sent D'Agostino on loan to Football League One club Cheltenham Town on 22 November until 1 January 2008. Blackpool manager, Simon Grayson said of the move, \\"This is a great opportunity for the lad to go and play some first team matches and we will be monitoring his progress closely.\\" D'Agostino went straight into the Cheltenham squad for their home match against Leeds United on 25 November. He was an unused substitute in the match, which Cheltenham won 1-0. Following three substitute appearances, D'Agostino made his full debut for the club on 29 December in a 1-0 away defeat to Tranmere Rovers. On 31 December his loan deal was extended by a further four weeks. On 2 January 2008 he made his home debut for the club in a 1-0 win against Port Vale.

The club's fans nicknamed him \\"Daggers\\" and his loan spell was due to end following the 1-0 home defeat to Millwall on 29 January. However, Cheltenham had already confirmed that they would try and extend the loan period further, and Blackpool manager Simon Grayson confirmed that the club were willing to extend the loan period by a further four weeks. His loan deal was extended by a further four weeks. Then on 31 January Blackpool agreed to extend the loan period until the end of the season, when he would return to Bloomfield Road and Blackpool expected to activate the one-year contract extension. Keith Downing said of the deal, \\"Hopefully they (Blackpool) are pleased with the progress Michael has made with us as we are helping him develop as a player as well.\\" Simon Grayson added \\"Michael has done well. We will keep a regular check on his progress and next season I would imagine he will be in and around our squad.\\" Return to Blackpool After returning to Blackpool, on 7 May 2008 Blackpool activated an option to extend his contract with the club by one year. On 16 December 2008 he was released by Blackpool. Hereford United On 20 February 2009, after a short trial, D'Agostino joined League One club Hereford United on an initial one-month contract.

Just before leaving office as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in June 2004, Paul Bremer signed the order, which says: > Contractors shall not be subject to Iraqi laws or regulations in matters > relating to the terms and conditions of their Contracts, including licensing > and registering employees, businesses and corporations; provided, however, > that Contractors shall comply with such applicable licensing and > registration laws and regulations if engaging in business or transactions in > Iraq other than Contracts. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Order, > Private Security Companies and their employees operating in Iraq must comply > with all CPA Orders, Regulations, Memoranda, and any implementing > instructions or regulations governing the existence and activities of > Private Security Companies in Iraq, including registration and licensing of > weapons and firearms. It took effect in December 2006. At that time, there were thought to be at least 100,000 private military contractors working directly for the United States Department of Defense, a tenfold increase since the Persian Gulf War just over a decade earlier. This activity led to the foundation of a trade group called the Private Security Company Association of Iraq.  Responses  In Iraq, the issue of accountability, especially in the case of contractors carrying weapons, is sensitive. One major incident in 2007 involved Blackwater guards who killed 17 Iraqi civilians in a mass shooting in Nisour Square. Iraq's government maintained that this was murder but was unable to prosecute the guards because they had immunity. A month after the Nisour Square massacre, the Iraqi cabinet approved draft legislation intended to end contractors' immunity. Contractors would be required to license their weapons, to register their equipment including armored vehicles and helicopters, and (if foreign) to obtain visas, something not previously required when working for an agency of a country in the coalition. At the same time, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act (H.R. 2740) which would have made U.S. security contractors in Iraq subject to U.S. criminal law; however, the Senate never voted on it. In December 2008, a Status of Forces Agreement between Iraq and the US made contractors subject to Iraqi criminal law.

The second ship to be named Brambling by the Navy was laid down as YMS-109 on 21 May 1941 at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, by the Burger Boat Co.; launched on 16 May 1942; and commissioned on 23 September 1942, Lt. Crittenden B. Taylor, USNR, in command.  World War II service  After completing her outfitting period, YMS-109 reported for duty with the 5th Naval District. She conducted minesweeping operations out of Little Creek, Virginia, and performed experimental work in the York River. In addition, the motor minesweeper escorted coastal shipping and made antisubmarine patrols in the Chesapeake Bay area.  Transit to Pacific Ocean  Those duties lasted until 20 July 1945 when YMS 109 departed Norfolk, Virginia, on her way to the U.S. West Coast. Sailing via Miami, Florida and the Panama Canal, she arrived at San Pedro, California, on 15 August. After repairs at Wilmington, California, YMS-109 moved south to San Diego, California. On 1 October, she departed San Diego in company with several other yard craft bound for the Hawaiian Islands. The minesweeper remained in the islands through the end of 1945 and into the early months of 1946. During that time, she conducted patrols and carried passengers between various places in the islands.  Post-war activity  In April 1946, YMS-109 departed Pearl Harbor to return to the United States. She arrived in San Francisco, California, on 2 May and unloaded her minesweeping gear. On 28 May, she got underway for the U.S. East Coast. The minesweeper transited the Panama Canal on 13 June and continued her voyage to Tompkinsville, New York, where she arrived on 1 July.  Naval Reserve training ship  On 12 July, she returned to sea, bound ultimately for Detroit, Michigan. En route, the warship visited Quebec, Canada, before heading up the St. Lawrence River and into Lake Ontario. She arrived at Detroit on 24 July. On 7 August 1946, YMS-109 was decommissioned at the Detroit Naval Armory where she began duty as a naval reserve training ship. She was named Brambling and was redesignated AMS-42 on 19 August 1947. Her naval reserve training assignment in the 9th Naval District lasted until the beginning of 1950. In February of that year, she was placed in reserve at Orange, Texas.  Reactivated during Korean War  Her retirement, however, proved to be only a year in duration since the outbreak of the war in Korea in June 1950 prompted an increase in the Navy's demand for active warships. Accordingly, Brambling was recommissioned on 12 February 1951. Her role, though, was not of an active combat nature. Instead, she helped free ships of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet‚Äîships in a higher state of combat readiness than she‚Äîfor service in the combat zone.  Assigned to school ship and other duties  Throughout the Korean War, Brambling made her contribution as a training ship at the Mine Warfare School, Yorktown, Virginia, helping to train minesweeper sailors for service in Korean waters. Later, after the Korean War subsided, she occupied her time with the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and independent ships exercises punctuated by assignments with the Naval Mine Defense Laboratory at Panama City, Florida. On 7 February 1955, Brambling was redesignated MSCO-42.  Inactivation and decommissioning  Not long thereafter, however, she received orders to prepare for inactivation at Green Cove Springs, Florida. The warship arrived there on 19 April and was immediately placed in commission, in reserve, for the inactivation process. On 17 July 1955, Brambling was decommissioned and berthed with the Green Cove Springs Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Navy list sometime in November 1959, and she was sold on 31 August 1961 to Mr. H. G. Mann, of Jacksonville, Florida.

They achieved underground cult status as a war metal band.  History  The band was first formed under the name Corpse Molestation and at the time played black/death metal with five demos and one demo compilation under the name. Their lyrical themes involved death, war and blasphemy. The band also used pseudonyms instead of actual names to hide their identity. They were one of the pioneers of Australian black metal and extreme metal, recording two black/death metal albums in the mid-nineties before breaking up. Their style was raw and furious, taking off from the old-school black metal style found in such bands as Bathory, Sarc√≥fago, Beherit, and Blasphemy. Many members of Bestial Warlust went on to form Destr√∂yer 666 and participate in other Australian extreme metal acts. In November 2019, the group announced a show at the Croxton Bandroom in Melbourne. Initially announced for 31 October 2020, it was delayed to an as-yet-to-be-announced date in March 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It was located on the southeastern edge of the town of Sussex, New Brunswick. Camp Sussex was established in May 1885 when New Brunswick militia units assembled in a large tented camp at the site south of the Intercolonial Railway mainline to prepare for service in the North West Rebellion. Few permanent buildings were constructed, although a large area of forest and farm land was cleared on the flat floodplain in the Kennebecasis River valley. During World War I, Camp Sussex hosted the First Training Battalion of the New Brunswick Regiment, later renamed the 1st Depot Battalion in 1918. The start of World War II saw the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division authorized in 1940 under the command of Major-General E.W. Sansom. The army decided to concentrate the 3 CID in the Maritimes and one of the areas selected was Camp Sussex. The camp was enlarged to handle a brigade with units arriving that fall for training. After the 3 CID units departed for overseas deployment, they were replaced by units from the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. Following deployment of the 4 CID, the 17th Infantry Brigade of the 7th Canadian Infantry Division began to use the training facilities; the 7 CID being the general reserve for Atlantic Command. In April 1943 the 17th Infantry Brigade consisted of the Victoria Rifles of Canada, The Dufferin and Haldimand Rifles of Canada and Les Voltigeurs de Qu√©bec. The A-34 Special Officer's Training Centre was established at Camp Sussex from 1944-1945 to train officers for the CANLOAN program Following World War II, the Canadian Army used Camp Sussex as a minor facility for training reserve units in New Brunswick until the construction of Camp Gagetown. The 8th Hussars (Princes Louise's) (Militia) continued to use facilities on the site until the early 70s when Camp Sussex was closed. Until at least 1969, in addition to the Tank Hangar, the Officer's and Sgt's Messes, two H-hut barracks, an H-hut kitchen, a Drill Hall and a parade square were all in use by the 8 CH. The Regiment also trained on 5 M4A2E8 Sherman tanks until they were removed in the late 60s. The land was purchased from the Department of National Defence by the town of Sussex however few landmarks remain. Modern- day Leonard Drive runs through the middle of the training camp and the modern Brigadier Milton Gregg VC Armoury has been constructed on a tiny portion of the former camp to house B Squadron 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's), a local armoured reserve unit. A nearby rifle range that dates to the days of Camp Sussex remains DND property but is not used for training. The most visible remnant of Camp Sussex is a former tank hangar, now used by the New Brunswick Agricultural Museum. The governments of Canada and the United Kingdom and the CANLOAN Army Officers Association erected a memorial on 3 June 1961 in Ottawa, Ontario dedicated to the memory of the 128 CANLOAN fatalities within the 673 that served in the British Army during the Second World War.

He failed to settle at that club and so he returned to North East England, where he played non-league football for Easington Colliery Welfare. At the end of World War I, an interest was shown in him by Clapton Orient, beginning a successful league career. Williams spent five years at Orient, making over 160 appearances.

This made him the side's first international footballer and, along with John Townrow, shares the Orient record for most England national team appearances, both with just two. In February 1924 he signed for Middlesbrough, making his debut three days later against West Bromwich Albion. At the end of that season, Middlesbrough were relegated, but Williams stayed.

A tributary kingdom from 1630 it was controlled by various Sultanates until 1814, when it became an independent sultanate and broke away from the Sultanate of Siak. The ruler of Aceh converted to Islam in the mid-15th century.Barwise and White, 114 The Sultanate of Aceh was founded by Ali Mughayat Syah, who began campaigns to extend his control over northern Sumatra in 1520.Ricklefs, 32 The sultan Iskandar Muda expanded Aceh by conquest. In 1612 Deli was militarily defeated and annexed. Dutch intervention in 1861, which resulted in a contract with the Netherlands East Indies the following year, helped to recognise Deli's independence from Aceh and Siak. Now part of North Sumatera, Indonesia, the sultanate remains as a symbol of the history of Medan. History The history of the Sultanate of Deli and also the Sultanate of Serdang are closely related to the heyday of the Sultanate of Aceh Darussalam during the administration of Sultan Iskandar Muda (1607‚Äì1636). Aceh Darussalam started its expansion in 1612 by invading the cities along the East Coast of Sumatra.Denys Lombard, 2007:134 Deli harbour was conquered in six weeks, while the Kingdom of Aru surrendered in early 1613 AD. The Kingdom of Aru, located in East Sumatra, was called the Kingdom of Haru, in some works such as those of Tuanku Luckman Sinar Basarshah II who frequently wrote about the history of the kingdoms of East Sumatra. Aceh Darussalam's conquest was led by Muhammad Dalik who assumed a title as Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan. This Aceh Darussalam commander was a descendant of Amir Muhammad Badar ud-din Khan, a nobleman from India who married Princess Chandra Dewi, daughter of the Sultan of Samudera Pasai. Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan nicknamed Laksamana Kuda Bintan (Admiral Horse of Bintan) was also believed to have led Aceh Darussalam troops against the Portuguese in 1629 and to have then conquered Pahang (1617), Kedah (1620), and Nias (1624), as well as some other areas.(Tengku Luckman Sinar, 2007:4) 2005-present day  Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan, founder of the Sultanate of Deli  Sultan Iskandar Muda granted Aru territory to Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan. In 1632, Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan was appointed the vice of Sultan Iskandar Muda to rule the former territory of Aru.Tuanku Luckman Sinar Basarshah II, 2003:2 Acehnese interests in the occupation of the former Kingdom of Aru territory were. # To destroy the remaining resistance of the Kingdom of Aru which was aided by Portuguese; # Spread the teachings of Islam into interior areas, and # Establish rule that was part of the Aceh Darussalam.Basarshah II, nd: 49 Shortly after being appointed ruler of Aru territory representing the Sultan of Aceh, Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan was appointed by the four kings of the Batak Karo urung (country) as a Datuk Tunggal or Ulon Janji, which was a position with an authority equivalent to the position of prime minister or grand vizier.Basarshah II , nd: 50 In the coronation, an oath to obey was pronounced by the Orang-orang Besar and people for Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan. At the same time, Lembaga Datuk Berempat was also established that served as an advisory council for the government of Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan. The four Batak Karo kings became members of this institution. The four kings of Batak Karo were the leaders of the four kingdoms in the Batak Karo region that had accepted the teaching of Islam and conquered by the Sultanate of Aceh Darussalam in the conquest led by Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan. One of the four Batak Karo kings is King Undo Sunggal who is also father-in-law of Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan. In 1632, Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan married King Undo Sunggal's daughter, named Princess Nang Baluan Beru Surbakti. Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan died in 1641, and the control over Deli was bequeathed to his son, Tuanku Panglima Perunggit titled Panglima Deli. Meanwhile, Sultan Iskandar Muda had died in 1636 AD in Aceh. The leadership of Sultanate of Aceh Darussalam was passed to Sultan Iskandar Muda son-in-law, Sultan Iskandar Thani, who was on the throne until 1641.Djoened Marwati Poesponegoro & Nugroho Notosusanto, 1982:70 Aceh Darussalam weakened after Sultan Iskandar Thani died. His successor was also his wife and the daughter of Sultan Iskandar Muda, Sultanah Safi al-Din Taj al-Alam (Puteri Sri Alam). The unstable Aceh Darussalam was an opportunity for Tuanku Panglima Perunggit. In 1669, Tuanku Panglima Perunggit proclaimed independence from the Sultanate of Aceh Darussalam and established a connection with the Dutch in Malacca (Basarshah II, nd: 50). Thus, officially the Sultanate of Deli established a sovereign government with the capital in Labuhan, located approximately 20 kilometres from Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province today. Labuhan, government centre of the first Sultanate of Deli. The name of Deli had actually been listed in the archives of the VOC (Dutch East India Company) in Malacca, in the record of April 1641. This was the year when the Dutch seized Malacca from the Portuguese. In that record, it was stated that according to the report of the admiral of Johor, Aceh army had gathered in Kuala Deli. At that time, the Sultanate of Aceh Darussalam was involved in a conflict with the Sultanate of Johor which previously assisted the Portuguese and then the Dutch.Basarshah II, nd: 51 Another Dutch archive that mentions Deli is a record dated 9 September 1641 containing a letter from Sultanah Safi al-Din Taj al-Alam to the Governor-General Antonio van Diemen (1636‚Äì1645) in Batavia. In her letter, the Sultanah stated that the Dutch could trade up to Deli and Besitang. According to the VOC record in October 1644, a ruler titled Tuanku Panglima Deli had sent letters and gifts to the Dutch in Malacca, but the group's envoy had been robbed in Deli near Penaji River, the area of Malacca.Basarshah II, nd: 51  The fragmentation of the royal family of the Sultanate of Deli  Sultan Ma'amun Al Rashid Perkasa Alam Shah's funeral Aerial view of Maimoon Palace The Deli Sultan after Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan, Tuanku Panglima Perunggit or Panglima Deli, died in 1700. His successor was Tuanku Panglima Paderap who ruled until 1720. The Sultanate of Deli was shaken by internal fragmentation shortly after Tuanku Panglima Paderap died. The deceased's children made a fuss about who should be entitled to occupy the position as the next Sultan of Deli. Despite his status as the oldest child, Tuanku Jalaludin Gelar Kejuruan Metar was excluded from the candidates for the throne of the Sultanate of Deli because his eyes were impaired. This situation made Tuanku Panglima Pasutan, second son of the late Tuanku Panglima Paderap, willing to take over the throne despite the fact that the right to assume the next leadership was to Tuanku Umar Johan Alamsyah Gelar Kejeruan Junjongan (fourth son) because he was born from the queen. There was a civil war between the two sons. Meanwhile, Tuanku Tawar (Arifin) Gelar Kejuruan Santun chose to avoid the war between the two brothers and opened a country in Denai which later expanded to Serbajadi. In the civil war that culminated in 1732, Tuanku Panglima Pasutan beat Tuanku Umar Johan Alamsyah Gelar Kejeruan Junjongan out of the palace. Tuanku Umar Johan Alamsyah Gelar Kejeruan Junjongan was forced with his mother, Tuanku Panglima Sampali (the queen of Tuanku Panglima Paderap), to take refuge until they arrived at a place later called Kampung Besar (Serdang). Therefore, Tuanku Panglima Pasutan freely declared himself as the new Sultan of Deli. Meanwhile, Tuanku Umar Johan Alamsyah Gelar Kejeruan Junjongan did not relax and got ready to establish the Sultanate of Serdang. This later sultanate came into existence because of the strong supports to Tuanku Umar Johan Alamsyah, especially from two Batak Karo kings, Raja Urung Sunggal and Raja Urung Senembah. In addition, Raja Urung Batak Timur that ruled the upper part of Serdang region in Tanjong Morawa and a high rank man from Aceh named Kejeruan Lumu helped support the establishment of Serdang. Finally, in 1723 Tuanku Umar Johan Alamsyah Gelar Kejeruan Junjongan was crowned as the first sultan as well as the founder of the Sultanate of Serdang (Basarshah II, nd: 55). The third son of the late Tuanku Panglima Paderap, Tuanku Tawar (Arifin) Kejeruan Santun, who had founded the country in Denai, then combined his territory with Serdang. Deli internal conditions that have not been stable made Deli region a target for a number of imperial states that were competing for influences. Monarchies that had tried to master the Sultanate of Deli were the Sultanate of Siak Sri Inderapura, the Sultanate of Johor, and the Sultanate of Aceh Darussalam which was apparently still wanted to colonise Deli again.Dada Meuraxa, 1956:24 Deli region considered very profitable, especially because of its natural resources. Deli was well known for its perfume, sandalwood, and camphor. In addition, the Dutch brought rice, candles, and horses from Deli.Tengku Luckman Sinar in Rogayah A. Hamid, et al., 2006:435 Due to their economic interests, the Dutch felt the need to maintain good relations with the authority and they also brought textiles from Deli. Amaluddin Sani Perkasa Alam Shah, Sultan of Deli, leaving the Great Mosque on the day of his cornonation Tuanku Panglima Pasutan, the fourth Sultan of Deli died in 1761. The government of the Sultanate of Deli was continued by Kanduhid who assumed the title as Panglima Gandar Wahid. In 1805, Panglima Gandar Wahid died. His successor was Tuanku Amaluddin. Because at that time the Sultanate of Deli was still under the influence of the Sultanate of Siak Sri Inderapura, the coronation of Tuanku Amaluddin as the Sultan of Deli was based on a certificate dated 8 August 1814 issued by the sultan of Siak.Basarshah II, nd: 52 After officially becoming the Sultan of Deli, Tuanku Panglima Amaludin obtained an honorary title as Sultan Panglima Mangedar Alam. Meuraxa in Sekitar Suku Melaju, Batak, Atjeh, dan Keradjaan Deli (1956) writes that in 1669 the territory of the Sultanate of Deli was captured by the Sultanate of Siak Sri Inderapura from the Sultanate of Aceh Darussalam. However, when the Sultanate of Siak Sri Inderapura was subjected to the Sultanate of Johor, the Deli Sultanate territory was under the control of Johor. In 1854, Aceh ruled again over the Sultanate of Deli, led by a commander named Teuku Husin. Sultan Osman Perkasa Alam Shah (1850‚Äì1858), the Sultan of Deli at the time, was taken to the Palace of Aceh Darussalam. But then Deli was acknowledged again as auspices of the Sultanate of Aceh Darussalam, who was then ruled by Sultan Sulaiman Shah (1838‚Äì1857). By Aceh Darussalam, the Sultanate of Deli territory was defined between the borders of Rokan to the south to the border of Tamiang.Meuraxa, 1956:25  Existence of the Sultanate of Deli  The Istana Maimun, the Sultan of Deli's palace The civil war between the Sultanate of Deli and Serdang ended in the early 20th century after pressure from the Dutch (rays, 2007:24). The relationship between the Sultanate of Deli and the Dutch went pretty consistent as they needed each other: the Dutch brought different types of natural resources from Deli, while Deli needs security guarantees. \\"Harmony\\" between the Sultanate of Deli and the Dutch East Indies colonial government increasingly stronger during the period when Deli was under the influence of the Sultanate of Siak Sri Inderapura. Throughout August 1862, Elisa Netscher who served as the Resident of Riau, accompanied by the Assistant Resident of Siak and some rulers of the Sultanate of Siak, travelling to countries in East Sumatra. This trip was made at the request of the Sultanate of Siak because several kingdoms in East Sumatra were reluctant to acknowledge Siak's power over those countries, including Deli. The countries in East Sumatra tend to get closer to the Sultanate of Aceh because Siak was considered too weak. On 21 August 1862, Elisha Netscher group entered Kuala Sungai Deli and was greeted by Sultan Mahmud Al Rashid Perkasa Alam Shah. To those guests, the Sultan of Deli proclaimed that the Sultanate of Deli was no longer having to do with the Sultanate of Siak and did not ask for recognition from anyone. However, Netscher continuously persuaded so that the influence of Siak Sri Inderapura over Deli would not lost by declaring that \\"the State Deli follows Siak and they together protected by the Dutch East Indies government\\".Sinar, 2007:28 Since then, the government of Sultanate of Deli was tied in a political contract with the Dutch East Indies colonial government. The regime of Sultan Mahmud Al Rashid Perkasa Alam Shah ended in 1873 and was succeeded by his son whom assumed a title as Sultan Makmun Al Rashid Perkasa Alam. During the leadership of the ninth sultan, Deli experienced period of prosperity which was mainly derived from tobacco plantation sector and the growth of Deli Company and other foreign entrepreneurs who opened tobacco plantations in Deli region. In 1872, 13 foreign-owned plantations operated in Deli. Deli soil was suitable for growing tobacco and producing world-class quality tobacco. Tobacco was sold in the European market for cigar making. When Sultan Mahmud Al Rashid Perkasa Alam Shah began to occupy the throne of the Sultanate of Deli in 1873, the number of tobacco plantations in Deli had increased to 44 estates. Tobacco crops harvested the next year reached 125,000 packs and made Deli as one of the largest tobacco producers in the world and Amsterdam became the largest tobacco market in the world. Payment from the plantations and land rents from foreign entrepreneurs made the Sultan of Deli very rich. At this time, Sultan Mahmud Al Rashid Perkasa Alam Shah built a symbol of the triumph of the Sultanate of Deli, among others, Kampong Bahari (Labuhan) in 1886 and the Maimoon Grand Palace in 1888 (Sinar, 2007:100). His successor, Sultan Ma\`mun Al Rashid Perkasa Alam Shah, who reigned since 1873, continued the development of the symbols of greatness by founding the building of Mahkamah Kerapatan Besar in 1903 and the Great Mosque of Sultan Al Mansun in 1906. Maimoon Palace was built in what is now the centre of Medan City administration and inhabited by the sultans of Deli and their families since 18 May 1891. Earlier, the sultans and his family lived in Kampong Bahari in Labuhan. The architect of this palace was a KNIL soldier (Koninklijk Nederlandsche Indische Leger, Dutch East Indies colonial army) named Captain Sinar, 2007:102 Maimoon Palace, the symbol of the Sultanate of Deli prosperity. After Indonesia gained its independence in 1945 and continued with the recognition of sovereignty by the Netherlands in 1949, the Sultanate of Deli, which was originally included in the territory of East Sumatra, since 1950 was merged into the province of North Sumatra until now. On the other hand, in those days situation in Deli and North Sumatra have not been in a truly peaceful state. Royal families in northern Sumatra, including the Deli family, were threatened because of the opposition from the anti-roya parties. The royal family at that time was considered as Dutch stooges and belonging to the feudal class. Still in the same book, Tengku Luckman Sinar also writes that the rebellion incitements had been rumoured since June 1942 during the era of Japanese occupation in Indonesia. The rebellion was started when the farmers harvested the rice, which was done with mutual co-operation and ended with the harvest feast.Sinar, 2007:121 Acts of violence against the nobility reached its peak during the bloody incident known as the Social Revolution in 1946. Many kings and royal family in North Sumatra were murdered and robbed of property and belongings, including Tengku Amir Hamzah, the Indonesian poet who was beheaded in Kuala Begumit. The family of the Sultanate of Deli and Serdang survived thanks to the preservation of the Allied soldiers who were on duty in the field to accept the surrender of the Japanese. After the tragedy of the Social Revolution ended in 1946, the family and heirs of the Sultanate of Deli occupied Maimoon Palace as a residence since almost all the palace there had been destroyed or burned. Maimoon Palace was the only remaining palace because at the time of the Social Revolution it was guarded by Allied soldiers. After revolution and independence the Sultanate of Deli still exists but no longer has any political authority. Entering the New Order era, the sultanate was ruled by Sultan Azmy Perkasa Alam Alhaj who was on the throne from 1967 until 1998. Since 5 May 1998, Sultan Otteman Mahmud Perkasa Alam served as functionary of the sultanate. However, the 13th sultan of Deli who was a lieutenant colonel in Indonesian Army died in an Army CN235 plane crash at Malikus Saleh Airport, Lhokseumawe, Aceh, on 21 July 2005. On 22 July 2005, the Crown Prince inherited the throne as the 14th sultan of Deli and assumed the title as Sultan Mahmud Lamanjiji Perkasa Alam.

Territory  The Sultanate of Deli territory included Labuhan Deli, Langkat, Suka Piring, Buluh Cina, Denai, Serbajadi, and several other countries around the east coast of Sumatra Island. When the Sultanate of Aceh Darussalam regained control in 1854, the Sultanate of Deli was proclaimed independent under the control of Aceh Darussalam and its territory was assigned between the borders of Rokan to the south to the border of Tamiang (Meuraxa, 1956:25). During the Dutch colonial government, according to the political contract between the Sultanate of Deli with the colonial government, the sultanate's territories included:Portrait of Sultan Ma'mun Al Rasyid Perkasa Alam, 1900s. * The area under the direct rule of the sultan (kotapraja/capital). * Urung (State) XII Kota Hamparan Perak led by Datuk Hamparan Perak Setia Diraja. * Urung Serbanyaman-Sunggal led by Datuk Sunggal Sri Indera Pahlawan. * Urung Sukapiring-Kampung Baru led by Datuk Sukapiring Sri Indera Asmara. * Urung Senembah-Petumbak led by Kejeruan Senembah Deli. * Percut State led by Kejeruan Percut Paduka Raja. * Jajahan Negeri Bedagai led by Pangeran Nara Kelana Raja Bedagai. * Jajahan Negeri Padang led by Maharaja Negeri Padang (Sinar, 2007:29‚Äì30). In general, the sultanate's territory was divided into two, namely the Hilir region which was inhabited by Malay people who had been converted to Islam, and Hulu region which was inhabited by Karo tribes who mostly had not been converted to Islam or still held the faith of their ancestors.  Governance system  The palace of the Tengku Besar (crown prince) of Deli Since founded by Tuanku Sri Paduka Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan, the Sultanate of Deli already had Lembaga Datuk Berempat that served as a government advisory board. At that time, Lembaga Datuk Berempat consisted of four Karo Batak King that had supported Deli since its declaration as an independent kingdom. Lembaga Datuk Berempat also had a central role in the coronation ceremony of Deli sultans. As the supreme authority, the Sultan of Deli did not only perform his duties as a head of state and government, but also served as the chief of religious affairs as well as Malays custom chief. In executing his duty, the Sultan of Deli was aided by treasurer, harbormaster, and the imperial servants whom each have their specific roles and duties. During the Dutch colonial era, the governmental system of the Sultanate of Deli was tied through a political agreement. Sejarah Medan Tempo Doeloe (2007), written by Tengku Luckman Sinar, mentions that the political agreement between the Dutch and the Sultanate of Deli was divided into: * Acte van Verband (Confinement Certificate). The certificate mentioned that: # the Sultan of Deli, as well as his successor, willing to execute the agreement between the Dutch and the Sultanate of Deli, # the Sultan of Deli will be obedient and loyal to the Netherlands Queen/Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies and implemented appropriate governance according to Deli's custom and regulations, # the Sultan of Deli willing to promote the country and the people, and # the Sultan of Deli willing to comply with additional requirements that were not yet clear or not listed in the certificate. This certificate was signed by Dutch government officials and Orang-orang Besar of Deli as witnesses. * Acte van Bevestiging (Deed of Confirmation). This certificate stated that the Dutch Government (Governor-General) acknowledged the Sultan as the king of Deli and this recognition was also mentioned in the Ordinance of the Dutch East Indies.Sinar, 2007:29 The governance of the Sultanate of Deli was executed by the Sultan of Deli, together with the Dewan Orang-orang Besar (as a replacement for the Lembaga Datuk Berempat) which consisted of four Urung and Kejeruan Percut after consultation and with the guidance of the Resident as the representative of the Dutch East Indies colonial government. The Orang-orang Besar was appointed and dismissed by the Sultan of Deli after consulted the Resident with respect to customs regulations. In addition, the Resident had the right to attend meetings of the Orang-orang Besar (Sinar, 2007:30). The Sultanate of Deli also had several important institutions supporting the governance. Some of them were the judiciary or Kerapatan Besar, Autonomous Police of Deli, and the Religious Courts. Al Mahsun Grand Mosque was built at the peak of Deli prosperity.

Walter J H \\"Papa\\" Riedel (\\"Riedel I\\") was a German engineer who was the head of the Design Office of the Army Research Centre Peenem√ºnde and the chief designer of the A4 (V-2) ballistic rocket. The crater Riedel on the Moon was co-named for him and the German rocket pioneer Klaus Riedel. Biography Employed by the Heylandt Company from 27 February 1928, in December 1929, Riedel was assigned responsibility for the development of rocket motors using liquid propellants, initially in collaboration with Max Valier who had joined the company at that date. Riedel took over full responsibility for the rocket motor development in 1930, after Valier‚Äôs untimely death following a rocket motor explosion during a test using paraffin oil (kerosene) as fuel instead of ethyl alcohol. In 1934, research and development of the Heylandt Company was taken over by the Army and amalgamated with the Wernher von Braun Group at the Army Proving Grounds at Kummersdorf, near Berlin, in order to carry out research and development of long-range rocket missiles. In March 1936, von Braun and Walter Riedel began consideration of much larger rockets than the A3 (under development at that time), which was merely a test vehicle and could not carry any payload. Along with Walter Dornberger, plans were drawn up for a more suitable and better equipped test site for large rockets at Peemem√ºnde, to take the place of the rather confined Kummersdorf. From 17 May 1937, following the transfer of the rocket activities from Kummersdorf to the Army‚Äôs new rocket establishment at Peenem√ºnde, Riedel headed the Technical Design Office as chief designer of the A4 (V2) ballistic rocket After the air raid by the British Royal Air Force (Operation Hydra) on Peenem√ºnde in August 1943, the transfer of the development facility was ordered to a location giving better protection from air attack. The air raid had killed Dr Walter Thiel (propulsion chief) and Erich Walther (chief of maintenance for the workshops), two leading men at the Peenem√ºnde Army facilities. In mid-September 1943, Riedel and two others surveyed the Austrian Alps for a new site for rocket development to replace that at Peenem√ºnde. The chosen location was at Ebensee, on the southern end of the Traunsee, 100 km east of Salzburg. The site consisted of a system of galleries driven into the mountains, and received the code name Zement (Cement). Work on the site started at the beginning of 1944 and was intended to be completed in October 1945. From 1 October 1943, Riedel was responsible for supervising the transfer, to Ebensee, of the Peenem√ºnde development facility. From 29 May 1945 to 20 September 1945, following the end of World War II, Riedel was held in protective custody (Sicherheitshaft) at the US Third Army‚Äôs internment camp at Deggendorf, situated between Regensburg and Passau. From 1 November 1945 to 10 March 1946, he was employed by the Ministry of Supply (MoS) Establishment at Altenwalde (near Cuxhaven), and from 11 March to 31 July 1946, at the MoS Establishment at Trauen (near Braunschweig). After the Trauen Establishment was disbanded, Riedel emigrated to England, to work initially (from 1947) at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, and later, from 1948 until his death in 1968, at the MoS Rocket Propulsion Establishment in Westcott (near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire). In 1957, Riedel became a British citizen.Riedel, W.H.J., Rocket Development with Liquid Propellents, Rolls-Royce, 2005 Riedel died while visiting East Berlin in East Germany.

However, he only played once for Huddersfield, and retired from professional football at the end of the season, and moved back to the Mansfield area, where he played for several local non-league teams before hanging up his boots for good. He now lives in Mansfield Woodhouse and is retired. He suffers from dementia which they believe is a custom to heading of footballs for so many years.

Argentina) is a 2005 documentary about diaspora Jews, who have either decided to remain in Argentina or move to Israel. Jorge Gurvich and Shlomo Slutzky, Argentine- Israeli filmmakers, travel back to Argentina‚Äîexploring questions of identity and the meaning of a homeland as they speak with friends and family who have stayed behind. Summary ‚ÄúNext year in Jerusalem,‚Äù goes the prayer that Jews have been chanting through two thousand years of exile. Yet nearly 60 years after the founding of the Jewish State, some who‚Äôve emigrated to the Holy Land still long for the home they left behind ‚Äî even if home meant poverty and persecution, as it did for many Argentine Jews. ‚ÄúI always raise the subject of my being Jewish upfront . . . for me it‚Äôs like my mark . . . it‚Äôs my pride‚Äù says one director‚Äôs brother. When people ask why he doesn‚Äôt move to Israel, he responds: ‚ÄúArgentina is the best country in the world.‚Äù Argentina has a long history of anti-Semitism and political unrest, which came to a head in the early ‚Äò90s when attacks on its Israeli embassy and Jewish community center left 116 dead, most of them Jews. For many Jews, Israel was the only way out, which was also the case during Argentina‚Äôs recent economic crisis. But now, more than ten years after the attacks, and with the country‚Äôs economy on the rebound, Argentina‚Äôs Jewish community is staying put. Directors Jorge Gurvich and Shlomo Slutzky grew up in Argentina, and made aliyah as adults. They have built families and careers in Israel but still visit Argentina frequently‚Äîperhaps out of a desire to stay in touch with friends and family, but also because, on some essential level, Argentina is still their home. While Shlomo and Jorge continue to straddle two worlds, some of their friends have returned to Argentina after making aliyah. And many, like Gurvich‚Äôs brother, refuse to even consider immigrating to Israel. Many see aliyah as an unwise tradeoff: while Argentine Jews exchange anti-Semitic slurs in the shadow of the attacks, life in Israel demands the far more immediate and permanent sacrifices of a country that is perpetually at war. Israelis believe that ‚Äúin order to be Jewish you need to live in Israel, to sacrifice yourself and to give up your children for the defense of the country,‚Äù says Laura, whose husband was killed in the community center attack. Laura resents the Israeli perception of Diaspora Jews that ‚Äúmakes us . . . feel as if we‚Äôre not Jewish.‚Äù The truth, she says, is that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to live in Israel in order to be a Jew.‚Äù While the vast majority of those who have immigrated to Israel may not return, some are still plagued by self-doubt and continue to question their decision years ‚Äî even decades ‚Äî after moving to Israel, especially in the wake of the intifada and Israel‚Äôs economic recession. But for Gurvich, any need for Jewish identification is satisfied in Israel where he ‚Äúis not preoccupied with my Jewish identity ‚Äî it seems natural to me.‚Äù And yet, he is drawn back to Argentina, and continues to regard this country as his home. ‚ÄúI have family in Israel, I‚Äôm an Israeli filmmaker, but my heart is still here, in faraway Argentina, and this tears me apart,‚Äù he reveals.

He also held the title of Graf or Count. Early life Gaisruck was born on 7 August 1769 in Klagenfurt, Archduchy of Austria. He studied in Salzburg, at the Collegium Germanicum in Pavia, and he received a doctorate in liberal arts and philosophy from the University of Salzburg. He was elected the canon of the Cathedral chapter of Passau in September 1788. In 1800 he was ordained a Catholic priest. The next year he was appointed auxiliary bishop of Passau, with the title of Bishop of Derbe, and accordingly he was consecrated bishop on 23 August 1801 by the last Prince-Bishop of Passau Leopold Leonard von Thun. After the secularization of the bishopric of Passau in 1803, Gaisruck had to leave the town and served as parish priest in the Diocese of Linz till his appointment as Archbishop of Milan. Archbishop of Milan The archdiocese of Milan remained vacant after the death of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Caprara in 1810 because Emperor Napoleon did not allow the appointment of a successor. The diocese was ruled for eight years by the vicar appointed by the Cathedral chapter, Monsignor Carlo Sozzi (1752-1824). This period of vacancy was marked by the Napoleonic Wars, and by the consequences of the anticlerical regulations of the previous years. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the Congress of Vienna assigned Milan to the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia ruled by Emperor Francis II. On 1 March 1816 Francis II appointed the Austrian Gaisruck as Archbishop of Milan without the previous agreement of Pope Pius VII. It took about two years of negotiations with Rome to settle the issue, and the appointment of Gaisruck was confirmed by the Pope on 16 March 1818. On 27 September 1824 Gaisruck was promoted Cardinal Priest with the title of San Marco.. After years of difficulty due to the Joseph's and Napoleonic anticlerical reforms, Gaisruck got started with the reform of the clergy: he took a census of all the priests and benefices in the diocese, assigned the empty benefices with open competitive exams, expelled many illiterate foreign priests particularly from Corsica, asked the government to open a penitentiary for priests (in San Clemente in Venice), and reopened the seminaries. Gaisruck, who was not Italian, ruled the diocese through a council of twelve Italian priests. Gaisruck had a preference for the secular priests formed in the seminaries of the diocese. His approach with the religious orders was complex: he did not allow the return in Milan of the Jesuits, Dominicans and Capuchins, but he allowed for example the Barnabites and the Somaschi, more active in assistance and education. Among the congregations of nuns, he allowed the reconstitution of the Ambrosians of the Sacro Monte and in 1844 the Ursulines. In 1841 he founded the journal L'amico cattolico (the Catholic friend) to promote an updated religious information. Gaisruck was charged by some anonymous priests in front of Pope Gregory XVI of Jansenist leanings and not to be enough a devotee to Rome. The pope himself wrote him a letter of reprimand in regard to the 1844 edition of the Ambrosian Breviary. Gaisruck rejected both charges. Cardinal Gaisruck participated to the 1829 and 1830‚Äì31 Papal conclaves. In the 1846 conclave, he was to present the veto of the Emperor of Austria against the election of Cardinal Giovanni Maria Mastai- Ferretti, the Archbishop of Imola, but arrived too late; the latter had already been elected and taken the name Pius IX. He died in Milan on 19 November 1846. He left all his properties to the Archdiocese of Milan and his remains were buried in the South nave of the Cathedral of Milan. Even if Gaisruck was personally deemed as a pious and vigorous pastor, his Austrian nationality and his idea of Church tied with the Austrian Empire made him unpopular during the last years of this life, in a period already marked by expectations for the Italian unification.

Brown moved to coaching cornerbacks in 1996 and remained cornerbacks coach in 1997 under new coach Dick Vermeil. From 1998 to 2000, including the 1999 Super Bowl XXXIV championship season, Brown coached the defensive backs at St. Louis. Brown coached under Mike Martz in the 2000 season. Among Rams players coached by Brown include Dre' Bly, Kevin Carter, London Fletcher, and Todd Lyght. In 2003, Brown joined Rich Brooks's staff at the University of Kentucky as defensive backs coach. Brown remained in that position until 2006 and was promoted to defensive coordinator in 2007. Brown remained defensive coordinator in Joker Phillips's inaugural 2010 staff and became co-defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach in 2011. Brown coached in Kentucky teams with three straight bowl wins (2006 Music City Bowl, 2007 Music City Bowl, and 2009 Liberty Bowl) as well as two runner-up bowl appearances (2009 Music City Bowl, 2011 BBVA Compass Bowl). In 2012, Brown joined Mike Munchak's staff at the Tennessee Titans as assistant secondary coach; he remained at this position under new coach Ken Whisenhunt in 2014.After the 2015 season, Brown left the Tennessee Titans. He returned to coaching in 2018, accepting the position of defensive backs coach at ETSU. Personal life Brown is the older brother of actress Olivia Brown, who co-starred in the hit 1980's NBC TV show Miami Vice.

Artie Kornfeld is renowned in the music industry as a songwriter, manager, producer, and an original co-creator of Woodstock '69.The Woodstock Preservation Archives On the concept of Goodstock, McClurg said, \\"This is not an attempt to go back, re-create or re-visit. It is a new 'happening' and an opportunity for the whole family to experience a re-awakening of the ideals of peace and togetherness through music.\\"\\"Goodstock 2007 Coming July 19 ‚Äì 21 in Summersville, WV \\" Kornfeld commented on his own enthusiasm of the musical revival: \\"Over the years since 1969 there have been attempts to recreate Woodstock. They had the acts and the stage but they did not have the Goodstock 2007 feeling of reliving a moment when all good came together through music as one ... I consider Goodstock to be the first real attempt to have another 3 days of peace and music. I feel magic again.\\" The original band lineup included headliners such as Jefferson Starship, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Iron Butterfly, Sky Saxon and The Seeds, and Mind Garage.

Naval service At 7am on 4 July 1814, Medway was under the command of Captain Augustus Brine when she encountered the USS Syren, a 16-gun United States brig. An eleven-hour chase ensured, with Syrens crew throwing their cannons, anchors and ballast overboard in the hope of escaping the pursuing British vessel. Their efforts were insufficient and the American vessel was surrendered at sunset. Her crew of 137 men were taken prisoner, and her cargo of ivory impounded and later paid out to Medways crew as prize money for the capture. Medway was converted to serve as a prison ship at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island in Bermuda in 1847. The colony had been selected for development as the primary British naval and military base in the North American and West Indian region following the loss of all British ports between Nova Scotia and the West Indies with American Independence. Bermuda's manpower was entirely devoted to shipbuilding and seafaring, and the shortage of cheap manual labour led the Admiralty to import convicts from British and Irish prisons, who were housed in hulks like the Medway. Conditions for the convicts were harsh, and discipline was draconian. In 1849, convict James Cronin, on Medway, was placed in solitary confinement from the 25th to the 29th for fighting. On release, and being returned to work, he refused to be cross-ironed. He ran onto the breakwater, brandishing a poker threateningly. For this, he was ordered to receive punishment (presumably flogging) on Tuesday, 3 July 1849, with the other convicts aboard the hulk assembled behind a rail to witness. When ordered to strip, he hesitated. Thomas Cronin, his older brother, addressed him and, while brandishing a knife, rushed forward to the separating rail. He called out to the other prisoners in Gaelic and many joined him in attempting to free the prisoner and attack the officers. The officers opened fire. Two men were killed and twelve wounded. Punishment of James Cronin was then carried out. Three hundred men of the 42nd Regiment of Foot, in barracks on Ireland Island, responded to the scene under arms.Bermuda Sampler 1815-1850, by William Zuill.

(2007) Properties of prolonged interocular suppression of awareness. Presented at the 11th Annual Conference of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, Las Vegas, USA, 2007. The duration of this motion-induced interocular suppression is comparable to that of continuous flash suppression; thus, the two methods can be used alternatively. The duration of suppression in both methods is maximized if the image being suppressed has low luminance contrast or a low spatial frequency spectrum. Motion-induced interocular suppression is fundamentally different from motion induced blindness: firstly, the latter is due to the interaction of moving and stationary stimuli closely located within the same eye, while the former requires an interaction between stimuli presented to different eyes in corresponding visual areas. Secondly, motion- induced interocular suppression can induce invisibility of a large stimulus presented at the fovea, whereas motion-induced blindness requires the stimulus to be small and peripherally located. Thirdly, decreasing the contrast of the stimulus to be suppressed increases the duration of motion-induced interocular suppression, but decreases the duration of motion-induced blindness. Whether motion-induced interocular suppression and continuous flash suppression have common neural mechanisms is still unknown.

For example, Java is said to be memory-safe because its runtime error detection checks array bounds and pointer dereferences. In contrast, C and C++ allow arbitrary pointer arithmetic with pointers implemented as direct memory addresses with no provision for bounds checking, and thus are potentially memory-unsafe.  History  Memory errors were first considered in the context of resource management and time-sharing systems, in an effort to avoid problems such as fork bombs. Developments were mostly theoretical until the Morris worm, which exploited a buffer overflow in fingerd. The field of computer security developed quickly thereafter, escalating with multitudes of new attacks such as the return-to-libc attack and defense techniques such as the non-executable stack and address space layout randomization. Randomization prevents most buffer overflow attacks and requires the attacker to use heap spraying or other application-dependent methods to obtain addresses, although its adoption has been slow. However, deployments of the technology are typically limited to randomizing libraries and the location of the stack.  Approaches  DieHard, its redesign DieHarder, and the Allinea Distributed Debugging Tool are special heap allocators that allocate objects in their own random virtual memory page, allowing invalid reads and writes to be stopped and debugged at the exact instruction that causes them. Protection relies upon hardware memory protection and thus overhead is typically not substantial, although it can grow significantly if the program makes heavy use of allocation. Randomization provides only probabilistic protection against memory errors, but can often be easily implemented in existing software by relinking the binary. The memcheck tool of Valgrind uses an instruction set simulator and runs the compiled program in a memory-checking virtual machine, providing guaranteed detection of a subset of runtime memory errors. However, it typically slows the program down by a factor of 40, and furthermore must be explicitly informed of custom memory allocators. With access to the source code, libraries exist that collect and track legitimate values for pointers (\\"metadata\\") and check each pointer access against the metadata for validity, such as the Boehm garbage collector. In general, memory safety can be safely assured using tracing garbage collection and the insertion of runtime checks on every memory access; this approach has overhead, but less than that of Valgrind. All garbage- collected languages take this approach. For C and C++, many tools exist that perform a compile-time transformation of the code to do memory safety checks at runtime, such as CheckPointer and AddressSanitizer which imposes an average slowdown factor of 2. Another approach uses static program analysis and automated theorem proving to ensure that the program is free of memory errors. For example, the Rust programming language implements a borrow checker to ensure memory safety. Tools such as Coverity offer static memory analysis for C. C++'s smart pointers are a limited form of this approach.  Types of memory errors  Many different types of memory errors can occur: * Access errors: invalid read/write of a pointer ** Buffer overflow - out-of-bound writes can corrupt the content of adjacent objects, or internal data (like bookkeeping information for the heap) or return addresses. ** Buffer over-read - out-of-bound reads can reveal sensitive data or help attackers bypass address space layout randomization. ** Race condition - concurrent reads/writes to shared memory ** Invalid page fault - accessing a pointer outside the virtual memory space. A null pointer dereference will often cause an exception or program termination in most environments, but can cause corruption in operating system kernels or systems without memory protection, or when use of the null pointer involves a large or negative offset. ** Use after free - dereferencing a dangling pointer storing the address of an object that has been deleted. * Uninitialized variables - a variable that has not been assigned a value is used. It may contain an undesired or, in some languages, a corrupt value. ** Null pointer dereference - dereferencing an invalid pointer or a pointer to memory that has not been allocated ** Wild pointers arise when a pointer is used prior to initialization to some known state. They show the same erratic behaviour as dangling pointers, though they are less likely to stay undetected. * Memory leak - when memory usage is not tracked or is tracked incorrectly ** Stack exhaustion - occurs when a program runs out of stack space, typically because of too deep recursion.

The Eastern Iron Brigade, also known as the Iron Brigade of the East and First Iron Brigade, was a brigade of infantry, that served in the Union Army's Army of the Potomac, during the American Civil War. For much of its service, it was designated as the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps. Among its commanding officers were General John P. Hatch and General Walter Phelps Jr.. Noted for its reliability in battle, the brigade developed a reputation which remained after it was disbanded late in the war, due to its annihilation from extremely high casualties. Origin of Eastern Iron Brigade The Eastern Iron Brigade consisted of the 22nd New York, 24th New York, 30th New York, 14th Regiment (New York State Militia), and 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters. During the Fredericksburg Expeditions the brigade had two cavalry regiments attached to it, the 2nd New York Cavalry Regiment (\\"Harris Light\\") under the command of Lt. Col. Judson Kilpatrick (originally of 5th New York Zouaves) and the 6th New York Cavalry. The pair of cavalry regiments were later sent back to their normal divisions. The veteran brigade, under Col. Walter Phelps, received its nickname when Brig. Gen. Christopher C. Augur began a campaign near and around Fredericksburg, Virginia, from April 16 to July 23, 1862. After the Fredericksburg Expeditions, Brig. Gen. Marsena R. Patrick commented to Augur: \\"Your men must be made of iron to make such marches.\\" The men of the 1st Brigade adopted this well-received nickname. From then on they were known as the \\"Iron Brigade,\\" and then later as the \\"Eastern Iron Brigade.\\" During the famous march from Catlett's Station to Falmouth Va., April 15th 1862, the First Brigade, First Division, First Army Corps, won the title of the \\"Iron Brigade.\\" It was composed of the Second United States Sharpshooters, Twenty Second, Twenty Fourth, Thirtieth and Eighty-Fourth New York Volunteers the Eighty Fourth as everyone knows, Being the fighting Fourteenth. The same name was afterward applied to the Second Brigade of the same division. Colonel Fox in his Losses of the Rebellion said, \\"It seems strange that two brigades in the same division should adopt like synonyms, but in justice to Hatch's Brigade, it should be stated that it was the original Iron Brigade.\\" The first Iron Brigade, to which the Fourteenth belonged, lost more soldiers through death or injury in one battle (the Second Manassas) than the British Light Brigade did at the Battle of Balaklava, which was immortalized in the famous Tennyson poem. The men of the Iron Brigade became so enamored with their \\"Iron\\" moniker, that some of the regiments had Iron Brigade placed on their flags, which they carried into battle. The news article below describes an exhibition showing off the battle standard carried by the 24th during the war and in 1865 the flag was displayed proudly after the regiment had been mustered out of service: > The veterans of the old Twenty-Fourth, (first Oswego County) regiment will > be pleased to learn that the Flag which they so gallantly followed and so > nobly sustained on so many bloody fields, is on exhibition, at the New York > Sanitary Fair, in the department of \\"Flags, Trophies and Relics\\"‚Äîa mute but > eloquent witness of their bravery and patriotism. It was deposited by Col. > S. R. BEARDSLEY, and bears upon one side the inscription: \\"24th Regiment, > Iron Brigade, 1st Division, 1st Army Corps.\\"THE BATTLE FLAG OF THE TWENTY- > FOURTH - COMMERCIAL TIMES newspaper, (COMMERCIAL TIMES newspaper April 11th > 1865.) Battle of South Mountain The Iron Brigade was heavily engaged, at the Battle of South Mountain and had just been taken command of by Colonel Walter Phelps Jr of the 22nd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment the day of South Mountain. The Iron Brigade received orders to make their advance up the mountain around 4 pm to support General Patrick's brigade in assaulting the confederate positions atop the hill. They were sent in as skirmishers to assist Colonel Patrick's men and then were posted behind a fence awaiting the command to move forward. > Colonel Phelps now ordered his men to advance, and General Hatch rode > through the lines, pressing them forward. They went in with a cheer, poured > in a deadly fire, and drove the enemy from his position behind the fence, > after a short and desperate conflict, and took post some yards > beyond.General Abner Doubleday's Official After Action Report South > Mounatain,Gen Abner Doubleday's Official Reports from South Mountain and > Antietam According to later accounts by Colonel Phelps, the brigade was ordered to move up the mountain and force the confederates away from a fence and take their position: > Too much praise cannot be awarded to the officers and men of this brigade > for their noble conduct on this occasion. Although the enemy were strongly > posted behind a fence, and apparently in larger force than our own troops, > they could not withstand the terrific fire and steady veteran advance of my > line. The conflict at the fence became desperate, many of the enemy at this > time being less than 8 rods in our front, but the undaunted bravery of > officers and men enabled me to drive them from their position and capture a > number of prisoners. The loss of the brigade at this point was much heavier > than at any other on the field.

Phelps Official After > Action Report South Mountain, (Col Walter Phelps, Jr's Official Reports > Reports of September 1862 on South Mountain and Antietam.) The Brigade was noted again for its performance at the battle of South Mountain, as noted by Phelps: > I cannot allow the conduct of Lieutenant Cranford, Fourteenth New York State > Militia, and Lieutenant Schenck, Twenty-second New York Volunteers, aides to > myself, to pass unnoticed. I was often obliged to send them, through a > galling fire, to different parts of the field with orders. Their conduct on > this occasion was most gallant, and all that I could have desired. It was > the more striking that their line of duty did not require their presence on > the field at that time, the former being acting commissary of subsistence, > and the latter regimental quartermaster.

Phelps Official After Action Report South > Mountain, (Col Walter Phelps, Jr's Official Reports Reports of September > 1862 on South Mountain and Antietam.) The Brigade took about 25 percent losses, at South Mountain, out of 400 Officers and Enlisted Men their casualties were Enlisted men killed, 20; commissioned officers wounded, 4; enlisted men wounded, 63; missing, 8. Total, 95. After Fredericksburg After the successful campaign, the brigade mostly did skirmishes and reconnaissance work for the Army of the Potomac. Before the July 1863 Battle of Gettysburg, the original 1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps was disbanded, and all of its regiments were transferred to other brigades or mustered out. Sgt. Major James Mero Matthews of the 2nd USSS wrote in his Journal the day they were transferred out of the First Iron Brigade: > (December 30, 1862) Orders Came Late last night to join Berdan's 1st > Regiment. So this morning after taking leave of the Brigade and Colonel > Phelps, we left this Old Iron Brigade. Colonel Phelps made a short heartfelt > speech and then the brigade stacked arms and took leave of us by shaking > hands.Sgt. Major James Mero Matthews Diary, In Green Diary (Soldiers in > Green: Civil War Diaries of James Mero Matthews, 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters.) At that time the brigade, under Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith, which had received considerable press attention as the Iron Brigade since the September 1862 Battle of South Mountain (then under Brig. Gen. John Gibbon), was redesignated 1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps. Disputes between the veterans of the two brigades increased in frequency and bitterness. Regiments like the 14th Brooklyn kept up the fight and always reminded their 2nd Iron Brigade Counterparts that the 14th Brooklyn was in fact a member of the First Iron Brigade. The men of the 14th Brooklyn never referred to the First Iron Brigade as the Eastern Iron Brigade because they felt as though they were in fact the first, original Iron Brigade of the East, and were the first and truly original Iron Brigade. UniformsWeaponsHistorical traces of First Iron Brigade Since the American Civil War, much has been forgotten, and the First Iron Brigade was almost lost to past memories.

Summary Over 150 Israeli and Palestinian children have been killed since the start of the Second Intifada in 2000. Lullaby tells the story of those grieving mothers in their own words. ‚ÄúMy daughter was born on the day the Intifada set off. When she turned 6 months old an Israeli baby was shot in the head; a month later a Palestinian baby was shot. This for me was intolerable,‚Äù says filmmaker Adi Arbel of her inspiration for making the film. In the film, eleven women describe their children's deaths in this horrible conflict. Their own struggles to cope with their personal tragedies show candor, emotion, and at times even a sense of humor. Transmitted throughout the film are penetrating revelations about motherhood, the gruesomeness of armed conflict, and the burden of bearing witness in the most tragic way possible. These eleven women come from varied backgrounds: Palestinians, Israelis, a Russian immigrant, and an American Christian living in Israel. The stories of their children's deaths are chilling, sometimes shared in explicit detail, and through these stories the viewer comes to understand a common thread among them. For some of the mothers, their tragedy is seeing their child brutally killed before their eyes; for others, their tragedy is not having been there to witness their child's last moments. A baby-faced Palestinian mother is as traumatized by having found her infant daughter's body ripped open by IDF gunfire as an older Israeli grandmother is by not knowing what happened to her daughter and two of her four grandchildren in their last moments. ‚ÄúThe neighbor told me she screamed ‚ÄòMommy‚Äô as hard as she could,‚Äù cries the grandmother in the film, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm just trying to imagine, to put pieces together to know what happened to my daughter in that moment‚Ä¶and I can‚Äôt solve this mystery.‚Äù Their children's deaths serve for all the mothers as a challenge to their motherhood, as they find themselves tortured by their inability to do what they feel is a mother's primary responsibility: to protect her children. ‚ÄúShe is so small and helpless and you are everything for her because without you she couldn‚Äôt live‚Ä¶and all of a sudden, in this attack, you are there for her, but you can‚Äôt do anything. Nothing,‚Äù relates a secular Israeli. ‚ÄúForgive me son, I could not help you when you called out to me, I was under debris,‚Äù a Palestinian mother recalls pleading to her son as she held him for the last time. But overwhelmingly, the greatest pain these mothers share is in missing the presence of their children. They all have that same wonder of what sort of adults their children would have become, and describe being haunted by their memories of their children. Finally, they share the necessary struggle of moving on, and of being complete parents to their remaining children. As the young Palestinian mother asks, ‚ÄúTomorrow, when my children grow up, how are they to see me like this? I am supposed to instill courage in them. They shouldn‚Äôt be scared of anything. But I myself am scared, I am terrorized.‚Äù See also Other documentaries about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: *The Land of the Settlers *At the Green Line References * * External links *The Jewish Channel reviews Lullaby *Lullaby's film trailer Category:Israeli films Category:Documentary films about Jews and Judaism Category:Documentary films about the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict ","title":"Lullaby (2005 film)"},{"id":"13344782","text":"David Bradford may refer to: * David Bradford (lawyer) (1760‚Äì1808), lawyer and deputy attorney-general for Washington County, Pennsylvania * David Bradford (economist) (1939‚Äì2005), American economist and professor of economics and public affairs * David Bradford (footballer) (born 1953), English retired football midfielder * David Bradford (photographer) (born 1951), American photographer, video maker, and taxi driver * David Cordley Bradford (1922‚Äì2002), British general practitioner * David Bradford, a character played by Grant Goodeve in the TV series Eight Is Enough See also *David Bradford House, historic house in Pennsylvania, USA, home of David Bradford, a leader of the Whiskey Rebellion ","title":"David Bradford"},{"id":"13344802","text":"Isoparce is a genus of moths in the family Sphingidae.

Christinas (Mozarabs) that lived in this zone, during the Muslim occupation, erected the Church of Corvo, where the mortal remains of the saint Vincent were deposited in the 8th century. The presence of martyr's remains lead the Portuguese to refer to the site and the peninsula as the Cape of Saint Vincent. The area has been intrinsically linked to the nautical school first developed by Prince Henry the Navigator, which was installed in the 15th century. Although born in the provincial city of Porto (1394), he would be connected with his life in the parish, until his death in 1460, being known as the Infante of Sagres. Although there existed a medieval settlement in this area (Ter√ßanabal), all the land was donated on 27 October 1443 to Infante Henry. The prince was associated with the Military Order of Christ, Duke of Viseu, Master of Covilh√£ and a man preoccupied with his signeurial holdings and defense of his faith. Henry obtained his wealth from the lands he held and the fisheries in the Algarve, and therefore preoccupied himself with needs of his workers, both materially and spiritually, and therefore invested in the founding of a village (later known as the Vila do Infante) to assist the population. The fortified town was situated on the Ponta de Sagres, a strategic point dominated the coves of Mareta and Beliche. Henry's controlled his material interests from his villa, located on the clifftops, and when he died on 13 November 1460, the Portuguese navigators and other services, had already reached Sierra Leone. Sagres was created in 1519, through the division of the municipality of Vila do Bispo. King Sebastian was known to have spent time in the parish, listening to music along the cliffs and the sea. A chronicle of the 16th century, referred to the young Kings stay at the Convent of S√£o Vicente do Cabo, and later, locals recounted that King was enchanted by the landscape of Sagres. In May 1587, explorer and privateer Francis Drake disembarked 800 men who assaulted the fortress of Sagres. After two hours of intense combat, fortifications adjacent to the fortress were destroyed and its artillery was pillaged. Until 1834, Sagres was an independent municipality. Geography The port of Sagres, historical center of the Portuguese discoveries and fishing port Sagres is located in the extreme southwest of continental Europe, and marked by two geomorphological structures: the Cape St. Vincent and Sagres Point, which establish a transition between the eastern coastal and meridional zones. Exposed to the Atlantic Ocean, it is influenced by Mediterranean currents, marked by promontories of high cliffs leading onto a platform that oscillates between (in the north) and ). Whether by coastal erosion, or the hard rock, its composition influences the relief of the area. At 157 meters high, Torre de Aspa is a viewpoint on the western side of Vila do Bispo, which offers a panoramic view of Sagres and S√£o Vicente Cape.Torre de Aspa Viewpoint Climate Sagres has a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csb) with mild winters and warm summers.

This led to the Islamic conquest of Emesa, which was a major trading city of the Byzantine Empire in the Levant. Background After a decisive victory at the Battle of Ajnadayn, the Muslim army conquered Damascus after a long siege in September 634 AD. The army continued their march northward and in late 635 AD, Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah sent Khalid ibn Walid with his mobile guard to begin the siege of Emesa and later joined him along the main body of the army. The Byzantine garrisons of Emesa and Qinnasrin made a truce with the Muslim army. It was agreed that Emesa would pay 10,000 dinars and deliver 100 robes of brocade and in return, the Muslim army would not attack Emesa for one year. If, however, any Roman reinforcements arrived to strengthen Emesa's garrisons, then the truce would become defunct. The gates of Emesa were opened as soon as the truce was signed, and thereafter there was free movement of Muslims in and out of the markets of Emesa, advancing the economies of major Byzantine towns. The garrison of Qinnasrin made the truce on the same terms. However, the governors of Emesa and Qinnasrin made the truce for reasons of expediency. Both hoped that their garrisons would be reinforced by Emperor Heraclius, and as soon as that happened they would repudiate the extortion of the Muslims.Akram, A. I. The Sword of Allah: Khalid bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns. Rawalpindi: National Publishing House, 1970. Muslim armies raided many cities in northern Syria, as well as the major towns of Arethusa, Hama, Shaizar, Apamia (known today as Qalaat al-Madiq) and Al Ma'arra (now Maarrat al-Nu'man). One by one, each city and town that fell to the Muslim army surrendered in peace and agreed to pay the jizya. It was while the Muslims were at Shaizar that they heard of Byzantine reinforcements moving to Qinnasrin and Emesa. This, naturally, led to the invalidation of the truce established by the city of Emesa. The arrival of winter gave the Byzantine garrison a further assurance of success. In their forts they would be better protected from the cold than the Muslim Arabs, who were not used to intense cold, and with only their tents to give them shelter would suffer severely from the Syrian winter.Tarikh al- Tabari, Vol. 3, pp. 96-97. Heraclius wrote to Harbees, the military governor of Emesa, \\"The food of these people is the flesh of the camel and their drink its milk. They cannot stand the cold. Fight them on every cold day so that none of them is left till the spring.\\" The siege Abu Ubaidah decided to take Emesa first, and thus cleared his rear flank from the enemy before undertaking more serious operations in northern Syria. Consequently, the Muslim army marched to Emesa with Khalid's mobile guard in the lead. On arrival at the city, a short battle was fought between Khalid ibn Walid's mobile guard and the Byzantine garrison of Emesa. The Muslims drove the Byzantine guard back, which forced the Byzantines to withdraw into the fort and close the gates. Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah arrived with the rest of the army and deployed it into four groups opposite the four gates of Emesa: #Masdud Gate (to the southwest) #Tadmur Gate (to the north-east) #Duraib Gate (to the east) #Hud Gate (to the west) Emesa was a fortified circular-shaped city with a diameter of less than a mile, and it was surrounded by a moat. There was also a citadel atop a hillock inside the fort. Outside the city stretched a fertile plain, broken only on the west by the Orontes River.Charles Greenstreet Addison. Damascus and Palmyra: A Journey to the East. Adamant Media Corporation. Abu Ubaidah himself, together with Khalid and his mobile guard, camped on the north side, a short distance from the Rastan Gate. Abu Ubaidah left the siege in the hands of Khalid, who thus acted as the virtual commander of the Muslims for this operation. It was now late November or early December, and the winter was at its peak. The siege continued and every day there was an exchange of archery, but no major action took place which could lead to a decision either way. The Byzantine expectations that the Muslims would not be able to withstand the cold of Emesa proved to be correct to some extent, but not as they imagined. It was about the middle of March 636 when the worst of the winter was over, that Harbees decided to make a surprise sally and defeat the Muslims in battle outside the fort, as the Byzantine hope of the cold driving the Muslims away vanished. Supplies were running low, and with the coming of spring and better weather the Muslims would receive further reinforcements and would then be in an even stronger position. Early one morning the Rastan Gate was flung open and Harbees led 5,000 men into a quick attack on the unsuspecting Muslim army facing that gate. The speed and violence of the attack took the Muslims by surprise, and although this was the largest of the four groups positioned at the four gates, it was driven back from the position where it had hastily formed up for battle.The Byzantine And Early Islamic Near East By Hugh N. Kennedy, Published by Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. A short distance back the Muslims reformed their front and held the attack of the Byzantines, but the pressure became increasingly heavy and the danger of a break-through became clearly evident. Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid ibn Walid to restore the situation. Khalid moved forward with the mobile guard, took the hard pressed Muslims under his command and redisposed the Muslim army for battle. After all these defensive measures Khalid took the offensive and steadily pushed the Romans back, though it was not till near sunset that the Romans were finally driven back into the fort. The sally had proved unsuccessful. Conquest of Emesa The following morning Abu Ubaidah held a council of war and expressed his dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Muslims had given way before the Roman attack, whereupon Khalid remarked, \\"These Romans were the bravest I had ever met.\\" Abu Ubaidah asked Khalid for his advice and Khalid told him his plan. The next morning they would make a fake withdrawal of the army from Emesa giving the Byzantines the impression that the Muslims were raising the siege and were withdrawing to the south. The Byzantines would surely attack the rearguard of the withdrawing Muslim army and at that moment the army would turn back, encircle the Byzantine army and annihilate them.Waqidi, p. 103. According to the plan, early the following morning, the Muslims raised the siege and withdrew to the south. Viewing it as a brilliant military opportunity, Harbees immediately collected 5,000 Byzantine warriors and led them out of the fort to chase the Muslims. He launched his mounted force into a fast pursuit to catch up with the retreating Muslim forces and strike them down as they fled. The Byzantine army caught up with the Muslims a few miles from Emesa. The leading elements of Byzantine cavalry were about to pounce upon the 'retreating Muslims', when the Muslims suddenly turned and struck at the Byzantines with ferocity. As the Muslims turned on the Byzantines, Khalid shouted a command at which two mounted groups detached themselves from the Muslim army, galloped round the flanks of the surprised Byzantines and charged from the rear. Steadily and systematically the Muslims closed in from all sides. It is said that Khalid with a small group of elite mounted warriors of mobile guard reached the centre of the Byzantines army and there he saw Harbees still fighting. Khalid made for Harbees, but was intercepted by a giant Byzantines general, who was killed by Khalid after a duel. At the time when the Muslims started their attack on the encircled Romans, a group of 500 horsemen under Ma'az ibn Jabal had galloped back to Emesa to see to it that no escaping Roman got into the fort. As these horsemen neared Emesa, the terrified inhabitants and the remnants of the Roman garrison which had not joined the pursuit hastily withdrew into the fort and closed the gates. Ma'az deployed his men in front of the gates to prevent the Byzantines in Emesa from coming out and the Byzantines outside Emesa from getting in. It is recorded that only about a hundred Byzantines got away. The Muslims, on the other hand, lost about 235 dead in the entire operation against Emesa, from the beginning of the siege to the end of the last action. As soon as this action was over the Muslims returned to Emesa and resumed the siege. The local inhabitants offered to surrender on terms, and Abu Ubaidah accepted the offer. This happened around the middle of March, 636. The inhabitants paid the Jizya at the rate of one dinar per man, and peace returned to Emesa.Waqidi, p. 104. Aftermath Soon after the surrender of Emesa, the Muslims set out once again for the north, intending to take the whole of Northern Syria this time, including Aleppo and Antioch. They went past Hama and arrived at Shaizar. Here a Roman convoy taking provisions to Qinnasrin and escorted by a small body of soldiers was intercepted and captured by Khalid. The prisoners were interrogated, and they provided the information regarding the plan of Heraclius, and concentration of a large Byzantine army at Antioch. The Byzantine army met the Muslims in August 636 on the plain of Yarmuk where the Muslims won a decisive victory against the Byzantines in the Battle of Yarmuk.

Located on the section of the river known as Bellows Bay, it features a long sandy beach and an active sandspit. It is one of the most pristine sand dune and wetland complexes along the southern Ottawa River. As a non-operating park, the park has no facilities and overnight camping is not permitted. Its primary purpose is the protection the sand dunes and wetlands and their distinctive species. Unlike most Ontario provincial parks, where hunting and possession of firearms are prohibited, waterfowl hunting is allowed within the park. Ecology This sand spit, dune and wetland complex occurs on the south shore of the Ottawa River near the town of Westmeath. It is built from sand deposits laid down by the Ottawa River near the end of the last ice age, when larger areas of the Great Lakes drained east down the Ottawa River Valley.L.J. Chapman and D.F. Putnam. 1951. The Physiography of Southern Ontario. University of Toronto Press, Toronto. 284 p. plus map in four sections. Near Pembroke this ancient river entered the Champlain Sea, and deposited areas of sand and clay as its delta within the Champlain sea, which at that time flooded west up the Ottawa Valley. Hence these dunes partly reflect an ancient ocean shoreline. The dunes appear to be the best remaining example along the Ottawa River. The park is home to 300 plant species, including 10 which are provincially or regionally rare, and a wide array of types of wetlands representative of the Ottawa River. There are six provincially significant plant species known, Bulbostylis capillaris, Danthonia compressa, Hudsonia tomentosa, Polygonella articulata and Stipa spartea.White, D.J. 2008. A Detailed Life Science Evaluation of Westmeath Provincial Park. Ontario Parks, Huntsville, Ontario. 55 p. There is also a substantial population of butternut trees. The park has a rich diversity of wildlife, including 184 species of birds sighted, of which nearly half may breed in the park. Black terns may nest in Bellows Bay. Many other waterfowl use the park during migration.White, D.J. 2008. A Detailed Life Science Evaluation of Westmeath Provincial Park. Ontario Parks, Huntsville, Ontario. 55 p. The Bellows Bay portion is home to the spiny softshell turtle and the map turtle. This is the only known location on the Ottawa River for the spiny softshell, which is designated as \\"threatened\\" under the Canadian Species At Risk Act,Spiny Softshell while the map turtle is designated as \\"Special Concern\\".Northern Map Turtle One of the important functions of natural areas like Westmeath is to provide natural areas for the study of ecological principles that apply well beyond the boundaries of the park itself. Westmeath is an important natural study area, as it has some of the widest variation in wetland plant communities of any single location along the Ottawa River, from open sand beaches with reeds and sedges to densely vegetated bays with cattails. Hence, it has provided an important natural laboratory for the study of wetlands along the Ottawa River in particular, and in marsh ecology as a whole. During the 1980s, a team from the University of Ottawa used this outdoor laboratory as one source of data for a wetland classification system for the rest of the marshes along the Ottawa River. The open sandy wetlands provided an important reference point in this classification system. Such areas have relatively low nutrient levels, particularly compared to most bays, and sites downstream from Ottawa-Hull. These open wetlands are dominated by partially evergreen and deeply rooted plants, that can tolerate the infertile conditions, damage by waves, and spring ice scouring. Another study used experimental transplants to measure the amount of above and below ground competition along the natural gradient from exposed sand shore to densely vegetated bay, showing that below ground competition was relatively constant across wetland types, but above ground competition increased with vegetation biomass. This was the first study to provide such an important documentation of competition gradients in wetlands, and led to a general model for above and below ground competition in wetlands. Studies of plant diversity also showed that this area has enormously high plant diversity compared to other types of wetlands. Table 1 in that paper refers to unusual shoreline vegetation, with plants including Ranunculus reptans and Eriocaulon septangulare (two evergreen species) and Drosera intermedia and Utricularia cornuta (two carnivorous species). Westmeath therefore provides an historical reference point for scientific papers in international journals, and these studies have even found its way into text books of wetland ecology.Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.497 p. There are also extensive areas of silver maple swamp. These swamps depend upon the natural variation in the Ottawa River. High water periods drown terrestrial plants that would out-compete the maples, while lower water periods in mid-summer allow the maple trees to recover and grow. Hence, spring floods are an important part of the ecology of these wetlands.Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.497 p. Owing to their small stature and slow growth, shoreline plants such as Eriocaulon septangulare and Drosera intermedia are easily damaged by human traffic and all-terrain vehicles. Illegal all-terrain vehicle use in the park constitutes an ongoing threat to its ecosystem. History Before its opening in 1991, the Federation of Ontario Naturalists pushed for the park to be designated as \\"Nature Reserve\\", which would give it maximum ecological protection and minimal human use. Ultimately, the Ministry of Natural Resources gave it the \\"Natural Environment\\" classification, which allowed for hunting, swimming and a proposed parking lot. Under the management plan, 47% of the park area is designated as \\"Nature Reserve\\".

Models have magnifications between 12 and 45 times, and feature panoramic view finding. Company history Tasco was founded by George Rosenfield in 1954. In March 1996, Rosenfield sold the business. At that time, Tasco employed 160 people at its Florida headquarters, and maintained a location in the state of Washington, which employed another 40. In June 1998, Tasco purchased Celestron, another telescope manufacturer which focused on performance optical equipment and the more serious observer. Celestron was second only to Meade Instruments Corporation in sales of telescopes. accessed Sept 15, 2007 Early in 2001, Tasco began searching for a buyer as profits sank. Meade Corporation begins negotiations for a merger, but the Federal Trade Commission blocked the attempt. By June 2002, Wind Point Partners, then the parent company of Bushnell Performance Optics purchased the Tasco brand and all the company's intellectual property. In July 2007, Wind Point Partners sold Bushnell Performance Optics along with Tasco property and sales rights to MidOcean Partners, a private equity firm based in New York and London.MidOcean Partners and Management Announce Acquisition Of Bushnell Outdoor Products, Inc. from Wind Point Partners On Sept. 5, 2013, Alliant Techsystems announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Bushnell. Under the terms of the transaction, ATK paid $985 million in cash, subject to customary post- closing adjustments.ATK Completes Acquisition of Bushnell Group Holdings, Inc ATK spun-off Vista Outdoor upon closing its merger with Orbital Sciences and became Orbital ATK on February 9, 2015. Anyone holding ATK common stock at the end of the business day on February 2, 2015 received two shares of Vista Outdoor common stock. Eligible shareholders had their brokerage account credited or received a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership. Vista Outdoor was thus initially 100% owned by ATK shareholders. Vista Outdoor stock traded on a \\"when-issued\\" basis from January 29, 2015 to February 9, 2015. It began \\"regular way\\" trading on the New York Stock Exchange on February 10, 2015 under the ticker symbol \\"VSTO.\\" No payment or action of any kind was required of shareholders. This transaction was conducted on a tax-free basis. Shareholders subject to American taxes generally did not have to recognize a gain or loss for federal tax purposes. Litigation On May 29, 2002, Tasco Worldwide initiated liquidation of all its assets.Miramar, Fla.-Based Binocular, Telescope Distributor Starts to Liquidate. The Miami Herald (FL), May 29, 2002. after defaulting on nearly $30 million in loans. The company had been searching for a buyer for several months, but after much interest by Meade Corporation, the Federal Trade Commission, on this day, sanctioned a temporary restraining order in federal district court to preempt any attempt by Meade Instruments Corporation, the leading manufacturer of performance telescopes in the United States, to purchase all, or certain assets, of Tasco Holdings, Inc. including Celestron, a child-company, and number two performance telescope provider in the U.S. The FTC argued that an acquisition by Meade of Celestron would negatively impact the performance telescope market by eliminating significant competition between the two companies and by creating a monopoly in the market for Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, which were currently only being sold in the U.S. by Celestron and Meade. Later in 2002, Tasco and Celestron, then under the ownership of Bushnell Performance Optics, fired back with lawsuits also in the District Court of California, alleging Meade products infringed on a United States patent entitled \\"Tripod Structure for Telescopes.\\" Both companies sought injunctive relief and compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, and attorneys' fees and costs. In December 2002, the District Court denied the motions of both parties. ReferencesExternal links *Tasco Official Website.

It also operates branch campuses in Pampa and Childress. The college was established in 1898 by the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and administered as a private institution (offering baccalaureate degrees at one point) until 1927 when it became a publicly supported two-year institution. As defined by the Texas Legislature, the official service area of Clarendon College is Armstrong, Briscoe, Childress, Collingsworth, Donley, Gray, Hall, and Wheeler Counties.Texas Education Code, Section 130.173, \\"Clarendon College District Service Area\\". History A Methodist minister, the Reverend W. A. Allen, conceived the idea for Clarendon College in 1879, when he established Allenton Academy at old Clarendon. When the town moved to its present site on the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway in 1887, local citizens offered the Northwest Texas Methodist Conference of land and promised to build a two-story building to relocate the college. Church leaders made it clear that they would build only if saloons were eliminated from the town. Rev. J. R. Henson, a local Methodist minister, led a campaign, which succeeded by 1902, to clear out the saloons in Clarendon's Feather Hill section and vote Donley County dry. In 1898, when the town's population was 2,756, construction began on the three- story building that housed president, administration, teachers, and students on Clarendon's campus. The institution, known as Clarendon College and University Training School, was accepted by the conference and opened in the fall of that year with four teachers and 21 students. Classes were offered in all grades, and primary and intermediate departments existed until 1923. J. W. Adkisson was the first president. Others were W. B. McKeown, J. Sam Barcus, G. S. Hardy, Harley True Burton (the historian of the JA Ranch), J. Richie Mood, G. S. Slover, R. E. L. Morgan, S. H. Condron, and in 1984, Kenneth D. Vaughan. Despite financial difficulty, by 1900, the school had a faculty of eight, property valued at $8,000, and 109 students. The first interscholastic football game in the Panhandle was played on December 5, 1903, when the Clarendon College Cowboys defeated neighboring Goodnight Academy 16 to 10. After a drop in enrollment in 1914, in 1916 Clarendon College had the largest enrollment of any junior college in the South. By 1919, the physical plant, with two additional frame dormitories and a new administration building, was valued at $175,000, and enrollment reached 350. The school added its third year of work in 1924 and its fourth in 1925 and was recognized as a four-year accredited institution. Baccalaureate degrees, awarded only in 1927, went to 19 students. After considering proposals to relocate the college at Amarillo, the Methodist Church ceased supervision of the institution on August 15, 1927. School assets, valued at $654,749, were liquidated, and on vote of the citizens, facilities were purchased by the Clarendon school board for the purpose of establishing a municipal junior college. In 1928, a 20% ad valorem tax for support of the school was passed, and later the seven-member board of trustees voted a similar tax for college maintenance. In the 1960s, the college moved to a new location, the former site of the home of pioneer rancher Thomas Sherman Bugbee on a hill west of town. A new building complex was erected, and during the 1966‚Äì1967 year, with a faculty of 17, enrollment reached 228. The Pampa Center, housed in the former Houston Elementary School in Pampa, the seat of Gray County, opened in December 1978 for night classes. Today, the Pampa Center is open for day and night classes and is housed in the new M.K. Brown Academic Center. In 1979 and 1980, vocational nursing programs were initiated with general hospitals in Shamrock and Childress. In 1980, the main campus maintained administration and classroom facilities, a physical education center, a fine-arts building, a vocational-technological center, three dormitories, a cafeteria, and a library of over 19,000 volumes. During that year, enrollment exceeded 400. A new dormitory, Regents Hall, opened in the fall of 2003 and houses 80 students. Vera Dial Dickey Library at Clarendon College In January 2005, the college built the new Vera Dial Dickey Library on the main campus in Clarendon. Enrollment for the fall 2007 semester was 1,135. Clarendon College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and offers liberal arts and agriculture studies, as well as business and other vocational training.

Bronk served as President of Johns Hopkins University from 1949 to 1953 and as President of The Rockefeller University from 1953 to 1968.

In September 1921 Bronk married Helen Alexander Ramsey, who had been a fellow student at Swarthmore. Turning to physics, he received an M.S. in 1922 from the University of Michigan. By 1924 he was intent on applying physics and mathematics to physiology, receiving a Ph.D. in 1926 from the University of Michigan. Career When Bronk was offered the presidency of Johns Hopkins University in 1948, he accepted the position on the condition that Hopkins strengthen its program in biophysics. Hopkins did just that, building Jenkins Hall in 1950 specifically to house Biophysics and adding faculty and research facilities. Bronk believed the nation's universities had a responsibility to prepare students to improve the world, regardless of their academic curriculum. He also recognized that, during World War II, the Hopkins faculty had spent most of their time performing defense-related research, and now it was time to rejuvenate the idea of research for the sake of learning and discovery. He frequently spoke on \\"breadth in education,\\" \\"fostering curiosity,\\" and \\"a university is a community of scholars.\\"Frank Brink, Jr., Detlev Wulf Bronk: 1897-1975 (National Academy of Sciences), 1979 In addition to guiding Hopkins through its post-war \\"demobilization,\\" Bronk believed strongly in maintaining his own presence in the scientific community. He presided over the National Academy of Sciences and served on boards for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Science Advisory Committee of the Office of Defense Mobilization, and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (predecessor to NASA). Bronk was also instrumental in reviving a plan to abolish undergraduate education at Johns Hopkins and turn Hopkins into a graduate-only institution. In 1952, as in 1925, the \\"New Plan\\" or \\"Bronk Plan\\" would have phased out the freshman and sophomore years and Hopkins would only admit students transferring from other institutions as juniors or above. These students would bypass the traditional undergraduate degree and begin work immediately toward a doctorate. As in 1925, the plan attracted little support from the intended student body and it was quietly dropped by the mid-1950s after Prof. Sidney Flax said \\"no\\".Fulvio Bardossi, \\"Dr. Detlev W.

The cars seat four people, two facing backwards, and freely spin after the first drop. In theory, this would mean every single ride would spin in a unique pattern. However, several sections of track are designed to make optimal use of the car's momentum, forcing the car to move in certain ways. The two roller coasters are raised via a vertical lift instead of the traditional lifthill. The Winjas feature a unique hinged section of track about halfway through, with Fear collapsing forward and Force banking sideways in order to continue. The two coasters travel on separate tracks and are intertwined in the main hall of Wuze Town. At the very end of the ride, a little surprise element is built in, which shortly drops a section of track a few feet and raises it again. The ride is themed to fit the Wuze Town environment, a fictional town of myths and fantasy. The character Winja after whom the rides are named, is the main character of the area.

Other soundtrack appearances of the song include: * The song is performed in the 1930 Talkartoon cartoon Wise Flies by a villainous spider attempting to seduce a female fly. The spider's vocals are taken directly from a 1929 recording of the song by Eddie Peabody. * Leland Palmer, Ann Reinking and Erzsebet Foldi perform the song in the film All That Jazz (1979). * Cab Calloway's recording appears on the soundtrack of Forbidden Zone (1980), with Oingo Boingo member Gene Cunningham in the role of Papa Hercules lip synching Calloway's vocals. * Kevin Spacey, playing Bobby Darin, performs the song over the closing credits of the film Beyond the Sea (2004). * The HBO original series Boardwalk Empire used this song in its first episodehttps://web.archive.org/web/20170428022222/http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk- empire/episodes/01/01-boardwalk-empire/music.html as well as the ninth episode of season 1: \\"Belle Femme\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20170707163838/http://www.hbo.com:80/boardwalk- empire/episodes/01/09-belle-femme/music.html * In the television series White Collar, in the episode 'Empire City', character June Ellington sings this song during the finale of the episode. Appearances in fiction * The song, or a particular recording of it, is a recurrent theme in Jean-Paul Sartre's 1938 novel Nausea. Sartre imagines some details of the \\"Negress\\" who sings it, possibly Ethel Waters. He further imagines that it was composed by a \\"Jew with black eyebrows\\" rather than the actual composer, Shelton Brooks. * In the 1920-set HBO drama Boardwalk Empire, the 1911 version of the song by Sophie Tucker is played in the pilot episode. In the ninth episode, Sophie Tucker appears as a character (played by Kathy Brier) in a cabaret show and sings the song. * Early in the novel Sexus by Henry Miller, the song is mentioned as being sung during a dinner celebrating a work bonus of $350. * The song's lyrics are featured in \\"Batman\\" vol. 3 Annual 2 (2017) by Tom King.

Adult females measure 6 to 8 cm and adult males 3 to 4 cm. T. suis eggs are oval (60 √ó 25 Œºm) and yellow-brown with bipolar plugs.http://www.aasv.org/shap/issues/v18n6/v18n6p306.pdf T. suis is also used in helminthic therapy studies. Lifecycle The lifecycle of T. suis is direct and does not require any intermediate host. Eggs are passed in feces from infected animals, but are single-celled and are not initially infectious. Infective J1 stage larvae develop within the shell in 3 weeks to 2 months, depending on environmental temperature. The infective J1 stage within the egg is highly resistant and can remain in this form for several years in favorable conditions. Once the infective J1 egg is ingested, the bipolar plugs are digested and the J1 larvae hatch in the small intestine and cecum. The J1 larvae penetrate the mucosa via the crypts of Lieberk√ºhn in the distal ileum, cecum, and colon. During the next 5 weeks, the larvae undergo four molts (J2, J3, J4, J5) to the adult stage within the mucosal layers. The adult‚Äôs thicker posterior third then emerges through the mucosal surface into the lumen, while the thin anterior two-thirds remains embedded in the mucosal layers. Adults can be recovered from the distal ileum to the rectum, but most are located in the cecum and proximal colon. The prepatent period is 6 to 8 weeks and lifespan is 4 to 5 months. Epidemiology Pigs are the natural host for T. suis, but it can also affect other species - including people. Humans probably become infected with T. suis by ingesting contaminated soil or water. T. suis is found worldwide, but is most prevalent in warm, humid climates. It is rare or nonexistent in arid, very hot, or very cold regions.http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/trichuriasis.pdf Pathology and symptoms In adult pigs, infections with T. suis can cause diarrhea, anorexia, anemia, poor growth, dehydration, and emaciation, but acuteness is usually connected to the infective dose or concurrent bacterial enteritis. Dysentery, anemia, and death have also been described in infections in younger pigs. Critical infestations of T. suis may cause acute morbidity and mortality in young female pigs. T. suis has been shown in trials to colonize humans briefly without triggering infections. Diagnosis In pigs T. suis egg production is sporadic, complicating diagnosis by fecal flotation. Necropsy of clinical cases of trichuriasis may be necessary to validate a diagnosis, since clinical signs may develop prior to patency, thus inhibiting diagnosis by fecal examination alone. On gross necropsy, the intestine may be filled with semisolid to watery to bloody mucoid feces, depending on acuteness of the infection and simultaneous bacterial infections. The anterior portion of adult worms may be observable breaching the cecal and colonic mucosa. Inflammatory nodules may be seen adjacent to the adults where they penetrate the mucosa. In earlier infections, the nodules may suggest pre-erupted larvae beneath the mucosa. Depending on the acuteness of infection, there is generalized moderate to severe typhlitis and colitis. In severe infections, the walls of the intestine may be thickened and a necrotic membrane may be located on the surface of the mucosa. Treatment The pathogenicity and symptoms are generally mild in human and it can be treated with medicines such as doramectin, ivermectin, and febantel. Although no treatment is initiated for pigs that are infected with T. suis due to the lack of clinical impact, piperazine can be applied to minimize the negative impact that the parasite reflects on the host. Helminthic therapy T. suis ova therapy may produce significant and long-lasting improvements in active Crohn's disease. In a study conducted at the University of Iowa, patients who had been administered with T. suis ova for 24 weeks had a response rate of nearly 80% and a remission rate of nearly 73%. Crohn's disease involves over reactive Th1 pathways and colonization with parasitic worms expands several immunoregulatory pathways that limit Th1-type inflammation. Parasitic worms generate production of interleukin 4 and interleukin 13, which are Th2 cytokines. This Th2 response restrains production of Th1 cytokines, thereby reducing colitis severity. Parasitic worms also generate regulatory T cells and immune regulatory substances such as transforming growth factor Œ≤, interleukin 10, and prostaglandin E2 that assist in sustaining host mucosal homeostasis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted pig whipworm (Trichuris suis) the status of investigational new drug,http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=helminthic-therapy- mucus&WT.mc;_id=SA_WR_20101207 allowing clinical trials in humans.

RPM Nautical Foundation is a non-profit archaeological research and educational organization dedicated to the advancement of maritime archaeology that includes littoral surveys and excavation of individual shipwreck and harbor sites. RPM Nautical Foundation (RPMNF) is organized to operate exclusively for charitable, scientific, literary and educational purposes, all within the meaning of sections 170(c)(2) and 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code. The operating purpose of the company is to engage in the detection, identification, study and preservation of nautical archaeological and historic sites for scientific research, public education, the advancement of technology. The organization also provides fieldwork and training experience in the field to students as well as the personnel and staff of various government, cultural and educational institutions. Among the goals for RPMNF is the effort to assist Mediterranean countries with the location, identification, assessment, and research of their submerged cultural material so that these important cultural resources can be protected for future generations. Accordingly, RPMNF projects are carried out in conjunction with host governments in the Mediterranean and serve as a crucial component in the effort to protect submerged archaeological sites and maritime heritage in association with UNESCO's efforts to preserve world heritage sites. RPMNF policy stipulates that all artifacts are under the jurisdiction of the host government at all times. The location and assessment of wreck sites, as well as site and artifact analysis is beneficial to the many governments that RPMNF works with, as it provides cultural authorities pertinent information for protecting archaeological resources. Over the past decade RPMNF has made advances in maritime archaeology of the littoral region of the Mediterranean through intensive and systematic use of technology. RPMNF's research vessel, the R/V Hercules, is a purpose-built maritime archaeological platform that has seafloor mapping and three-dimensional modeling capabilities for identification of submerged cultural material sites. The vessel is designed as a self-sufficient base for a wide range of project functions in moderately deep littoral waters, typically limited to 500 m. These operations include remote sensing equipment that includes autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and various multibeam systems, the deployment of ROVs, data and media processing and other research functions. Hercules is equipped with a dynamic positioning system and advanced data processing capabilities, as well as adequate deck space and lifting systems to transport and deploy survey equipment. Potential sites are verified and documented with ROV investigation. The ROV is employed for video and image documentation, sampling, artifact retrieval, and limited excavation of sites. The ROV is also employed for the excavation of deep-water sites; an excavation methodological process that RPMNF is helping to advance within the field of maritime archaeology. RPMNF research vessel R/V Hercules is Maltese flagged and based in Valletta, Malta during the winter months. This research vessel can be deployed throughout the Mediterranean on a project basis. History RPMNF expedition areas through 2014 The foundation was established in 2001 by its President, George Robb, who was a Director for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology. As part of RPMNF's initial foundation, it was establishes as a supporting institute for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology Early field work centered in Florida and select supporting projects in the Mediterranean. In 2003, Dr. Jeff Royal became Archaeological Director, then in 2011 took over as Executive Director, during which time RPMNF's focus has centered on the Mediterranean. At the end of 2010, RPMNF entered into an agreement and is a supporting institute for the Program in Maritime Studies at East Carolina University. RPMNF continues to grow its associations with Universities, individual scholars, students, and new countries around the Mediterranean.

To date, project areas include Spain, Albania, Montenegro, Croatia, Malta, Morocco, Cyprus, Sicily, Amalfi and Calabria in Italy, Tunisia, and Turkey. As all archaeological work is performed in conjunction with the host country's cultural authority, the one of the crucial outcomes is that the projects assist in both scholarly research and educational projects. All recovered artifacts remain under the jurisdiction of the host government for educational/research purposes and eventual museum display in each country. The location and assessment data of wreck sites has proved beneficial to the many governments with which RPMNF have worked as it provides their cultural authorities pertinent information for protecting their submerged archaeological resources. Bathymetric data is also made available to host country hydrographic departments in order to supplement their oceanographic mapping programs.

It was first released in the United States as The Big Risk. It tells the story of Abel Davos (Ventura), a French mobster who tries to make his way from Italy through Marseille to Paris, hunted by the police, and Eric Stark (Belmondo), who turns out to be the only person willing to help Davos. The film is an adaptation of the novel with the same title by Jos√© Giovanni. Now widely considered a masterpiece, at the time of its release it was somewhat overshadowed by the French New Wave. It did however influence the French cinema, especially Jean-Pierre Melville's work. Plot French gangster Abel Davos, having been tried in absentia and sentenced to death, flees to Italy with his wife and their two children. After a successful holdup in Milan with an accomplice Raymond, they try to re-enter France by boat, but while landing at a deserted cove by night are surprised by two customs officers. After a gun battle which leaves the customs men, his wife and Raymond dead, a massive police hunt begins. Hidden with his two boys in Nice by a former associate, Abel rings Riton, an old ally in Paris, asking him and his friend Fargier to come and collect him. Riton now runs a bar and Fargier a hotel; neither wants to risk his life or reputation for a lone wanted man. However they buy an ambulance and recruit a young gangster called √âric to bring Abel and his children back in it. On the way, √âric saves a young woman Liliane, who is being attacked by a man, and she agrees to pose as a nurse for Abel, who is bandaged to conceal him. Back in Paris, his friends tell Abel there is little more they can do for him. √âric however is sympathetic to the man's plight and, after hiding him in the building where he lives, helps him place his children with family friends. He also gets him a false passport but Abel, needing money to escape, robs the fence Gibelin. Unable to go to the police, Gibelin consults Fargier and Riton, who are both under police pressure because of their past association with Abel. They hire a private detective to find Abel's hideout, but Abel captures the man and forces the truth out of him. Realising he is betrayed, Abel starts his revenge by killing first Gibelin and then Fargier, whose wife then dies of shock. Riton, whose wife has always mistrusted Abel, co-operates with the police. As they storm Abel's hideout, √âric creates a diversion and is shot in both legs. Though Abel gets away, an epilogue says he is later caught, tried and executed. Cast * Lino Ventura - Abel Davos, a wanted robber and murderer * Jean-Paul Belmondo - √âric Stark, young gangster who acts as driver * Sandra Milo - Liliane, young woman befriended by √âric * Marcel Dalio - Arthur Gibelin, receiver * Jacques Dacqmine - Police inspector Blot * Claude Cerval - Raoul Fargier, old accomplice of Abel * Michel Ardan - Henri Vintran, called Riton, old accomplice of Abel * Stan Krol - Raymond Naldi, accomplice of Abel in Italy * Simone France - Th√©r√®se Davos, wife of Abel Production The Abel Davos character is based on the real life Abel Danos (alias \\"le Mammouth\\" because of his girth) who Jos√© Giovanni met in prison. From 1941 to 1944 Danos was a henchman for the French Gestapo run by Henri Lafont and Pierre Bonny. Danos was sentenced to death and shot for Collaboration on 13 March 1952. The film was a produced by France's Filmsonor, Mondex Films and Les Films Od√©on in collaboration with Italy's Zebra Film. Principal photography took place from 7 October to 8 December 1959. Locations were used in Nice, Paris and Milano. Release The film was released in France on 23 March 1960. It recorded 1,726,839 admissions in its home country.Box office information for film at Box Office Story The film was banned in Finland during the sixties. Reception Kenneth Turran in a review of 2006 for the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"To come across Classe Tous Risques is like discovering a bottle of marvelous French wine you didn't remember you had, opening it and finding it every bit as delicious as its reputation promised.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote in 2005: \\"Claude Sautet's Classe Tous Risques is the kind of French movie that makes you want to throw on your trench coat, light up a cigarette and shoot somebody. Originally released in 1960, it was lost in the frenzy of the Nouvelle Vague, which made its straightforward use of genre look a bit old-fashioned. ... It is worth seeking out, not only because Classe Tous Risques represents a missing piece of film history - a link between the great postwar policiers and the brooding 1960's gangster dramas of Jean-Pierre Melville - but because it is a tough and touching exploration of honor and friendship among thieves.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * *Film page at Le Film Guide *Classe tous risques: Beautiful Friendships an essay by Bertrand Tavernier at the Criterion Collection Category:1960 films Category:French black-and-white films Category:French films Category:French crime films Category:1960s crime thriller films Category:French-language films Category:Gangster films Category:Films directed by Claude Sautet Category:Films scored by Georges Delerue Category:Films about organized crime in France Category:Films based on works by Jos√© Giovanni Category:Films with screenplays by Jos√© Giovanni Category:1960s buddy films ","title":"Classe Tous Risques"},{"id":"13345135","text":"USS Lorikeet (AMS-49/YMS-271) was a acquired by the U.S. Navy for the task of removing mines from water that had been placed there to prevent ships from passing. Operational history Lorikeet (AMS 49) was laid down as YMS 271 by Bellingham Marine Railway & Boatbuilding Co., Bellingham, Washington, 3 July 1942; launched 17 October; and commissioned 21 April 1943, Lt. Charles E. Scherneck in command from 17 May. Upon completion of shakedown, YMS 271 departed Seattle, Washington, 21 August 1943 to undergo intensive antisubmarine warfare training out of San Diego, California. Two months later she was underway for the Solomon Islands via Samoa and New Caledonia. Arriving 5 November, YMS 271 operated as a screening and escort vessel in the Solomons until 21 July 1944. The tide of war having surged northward, she steamed next to Fiji Islands to sweep American mines from the area. Slightly damaged 8 October while taking a wind-driven, rudderless New Zealand corvette HMNZS Arbutus (K403) under tow, she repaired at Auckland, New Zealand, then resumed sweeping duties first around Noumea, New Caledonia, and later Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides. Withdrawn for the impending Okinawa Gunto Invasion, YMS 271 participated in practice exercises near Tulagi, Solomon Islands, 17 February through 15 March 1945. On the latter date, she sailed as a convoy escort bound for the Ryukyus. While the main invasion force stormed ashore on the western side of Okinawa, this wooden hulled vessel helped prepare the eastern bays to receive additional form of ships and men from 2 April to 12 May. Though 15 percent of all naval casualties during this ‚ÄúOperation Iceberg‚Äù were suffered by minecraft, YMS 271 emerged unscratched. Following a brief overhaul at Saipan she returned to resume sweeping of the Kerama Retto Passage before undertaking preinvasion sweeps around Kume Shima. On 4 July operations took her into the East China Sea but immediately following surrender ceremonies they shifted to the passage off Wakayama, Japan. Rotated home 25 February 1946, she proceeded to Boston, Massachusetts, and decommissioned 19 July 1946. She began a new career as a U.S. Naval Reserve training ship 1 September 1947, when she was placed in service and simultaneously reclassified as AMS 49 and named Lorikeet. She served the reserve training program in the Quincy Hingham, Massachusetts, area until she recommissioned 17 March 1950, Lt. (j.g.) William J. O‚ÄôBrien in command. Lorikeet sailed 29 May from Boston for assignment with MinRon 4 based at Charleston, South Carolina. After a shakedown cruise to Guantanamo, Cuba, in July, she engaged in coastal exercises and cruises between Norfolk, Virginia, and Key West, Florida. Reclassified MSC(O) 49 on 7 February 1955, she participated in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet‚Äôs largest postwar mine warfare exercises to date, Operation LANTMINEX in the spring of 1955. In late 1956 she shifted her home port to Panama City, Florida. She departed Panama City for Charleston arriving in late August 1957. She then sailed for New York 3 September where she decommissioned 18 September. Placed in service 30 October 1959, she once again became a Naval Reserve training ship, this time for the 3d Naval District. In January 1961 she provided the basis of training for two reserve crews attached to the Naval Reserve Training Center (NRTC) Jersey City, New Jersey. From 1 July 1964 to 3 September 1968, Lorikeet served as flagship for Commander. Naval Reserve Mine Division 31 and was based at Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Lorikeet was relieved as flagship and Naval Reserve training ship on 3 September by .

In 2007, following the release of the animated movie Asterix and the Vikings, Viking theming was added to the station and nearby rides, in the form of a wooden Viking longboat. Goudurix is located in the back-west of the park (southeast geographically, since park entrance faces south), near the Tonnerre de Zeus. The ride was repainted to a yellow and red track with grey supports color scheme from its previous white and yellow track with blue supports. It is one of the park's main attractions, along with the Tonnerre de Zeus, OzIris and Trace du Hourra rollercoasters. Previously known for its extraordinarily rough ride which was exacerbated by improperly-designed headrests and unnecessarily hard over-the-shoulder restraints, Goudurix was ranked as the worst steel roller coaster in the world in the 2012 Mitch Hawker Steel Coaster Poll. In response to this, it has seen numerous modifications, including new cars/trains and a complete re-tracking to improve the smoothness of the ride. Ride elements Goudurix has seven inversions in total: *Batwing (2 inversions 1 element) *Butterfly (2 inversions 1 element) *Vertical Loop *Double Corkscrew Goudurix's history Goudurix has seen many changes of its track, electricity and theme since its creation. *1988 : Goudurix built by Vekoma with known problems (such as violent turns) *2000 : Trains are changed and a few different wheels are tested in order to improve the ride comfort *2007 : Total recovery of electrical device *2007 : Theming added to the station *2009 : The whole track is entirely repainted in red and yellow (instead of white and blue) *2010 : A part of the trains are changed, making them heavier *2011 : Test with new wheels to reduce vibrations *2013 : Retracking References Category:Roller coasters in France Category:Roller coasters introduced in 1989 Category:Franco-Belgian comics in amusement parks ","title":"Goudurix"},{"id":"13345144","text":"Adam David Tanner (born 25 October 1973) is an English former professional footballer. Career Adam Tanner began his career with Ipswich and signed a professional contract at the start of the 1992‚Äì93 season and made his league debut on 2 January 1995 in The Premier League, scoring in a 4‚Äì2 victory against Leicester City. He also scored in a 1‚Äì0 victory against Liverpool at Anfield, the first time an Ipswich side had recorded a win at Anfield in their history. On 4 February 1997, Tanner was suspended by the Football Association for three months when a drugs test uncovered traces of cocaine in his blood. Both Ipswich manager George Burley and fellow player Simon Milton spoke as character witnesses for Tanner at the hearing. That season Tanner had made 16 league appearances in The Championship and scored four goals. He returned to action after his ban for the final three league games of the season. In November 1999, Tanner was arrested after colliding with a parked car in Witham. As he failed to stop at the scene of the accident he was later arrested and a blood test showed that he was three times over the legal alcohol limit for driving. In January 2000 he admitted the offence in court. In February 2000 he was spared a prison sentence and instead ordered to do 80 hours of community service, placed on probation for 12 months, banned from driving for three years and released by Ipswich in the same month. He joined Peterborough United, but failed to make a first team appearance and was released. He signed for Colchester United at the start of the 2000‚Äì01 season, before exiting Layer Road on 23 January 2001 and signing for non-league Canvey Island.

Elwedritsch, Ilwedritsch and so on), plural Elwetritsche or Elwetritschen is a birdlike legendary creature which is reported to be found in southwest Germany, especially in the Palatinate. The Elwetritsch can be seen as a local equivalent to mythical creatures of other regions (e.g., the Bavarian Wolpertinger or the Thuringian Rasselbock). The Elwedritschen had been forgotten for a while, until a gentleman named Espenschied \\"rediscovered\\" them. He began to organize \\"hunting parties\\" which were harmless pranks. One of the Bavarian Kings was once served roasted, small birds for dinner, which were declared to be Elwetritsche (quail).  Appearance, origin and descendants  Sculpture of a male Elwetritsch The Elwedritsch is a fictional creature that supposedly inhabits the Palatinate of Germany. It is described as being a chicken-like creature with antlers. It also has scales instead of feathers. However, it is said that their wings are of little use. That is why they live mainly in underbrush and under vines. Sometimes Elwetritschen are depicted with antlers of a stag and their beaks often appear to be very long. In the second half of the 20th century, artists increasingly portrayed Elwetritschen as female by adding breasts. Elwetritschen supposedly originate from crossbreeding chickens, ducks, and geese with mythical wood creatures such as goblins and elves. Being a fowl, they naturally lay eggs, which as a result of descending from forest spirits, grow during breeding season. Eggs in various sizes are artistically depicted at the Elwetritschenbrunnen in Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe.  Geographical distribution  The area in which tales of the Elwetritsch are spread expands from the Palatinate Forest in the west of Germany towards the east across the Upper Rhine Plain to the southern parts of the Odenwald. The mythical creature also appears in the north of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. In the Main-Tauber-Kreis, where they are known as ‚ÄúIlwedridsche‚Äù, the children are told that at night the creatures sleep in the crowns of the willow trees standing next to the river Tauber. In Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe, which is said to be the ‚Äúcapital‚Äù of the Elwetritsches, there is an Elwetritsche-fountain, created by Gernot Rumpf. Other sources consider Dahn in the southwestern Palatinate, which also has an Elwetritsche-fountain, Erfweiler or other villages as secret capitals of these creatures.  Pennsylvania  In Pennsylvania among the Pennsylvania Dutch, the Elwetritsch is known as the Elbedritsch.Stine, Eugene S., Pennsylvania German Dictionary, The Pennsylvania German Society, 1996. The lore concerning the Elbedritsch is similar to that of the Elwetritsch in that the victim of the trick was set out with a bag to catch one and left abandoned. The Pennsylvania Dutch are convinced that Palatinate people‚Äîtheir biggest group of ancestors‚Äîhad taken some ‚ÄúElbedritschelcher‚Äù (diminutive of Elbedritsch) with them ‚Äúso dass sie kenn Heemweh grigge deede‚Äù (so that they wouldn't become homesick). Tales of the Elbedritsche are also documented in Amish communities. The newsletter of the Pennsylvania German Society is Es Elbedritsch.  Hunt  illuminated trap for a nocturnal hunt The idea is very similar to the \\"snipe hunt.\\" The Elwetritsch is supposedly very shy, but also very curious. A hunting party consists of a \\"F√§nger\\" (catcher), equipped with a big potato sack and a lantern, and the \\"Treiber\\" (beaters). The catcher is led into the woods where the Elwetritsch is supposed to live, instructed to wait in a clearing with his sack and lantern, while the beaters go off, supposedly to flush out the Elwetritsch. The light of the lantern is said to be attractive to the curious creature, so it will come to investigate and will then be caught by the catcher. While he waits, everyone heads back to the pub or wherever the party had previously assembled, to wait for the catcher to realize that he has been fooled. Like the jackalope, the Elwetritsch is thought to have been inspired by sightings of wild rabbits infected with the Shope papilloma virus, which causes the growth of antler-like tumours in various places, including on the head.  Traditions  There are clubs in several Palatinate towns and cities that promote the myth of the Elwetritschen. The Elwetrittche-Club in Landau, formed in 1982, is the oldest club. A square dancing club from the same city calls its annual 'Dance-Special' the ‚ÄûLandauer Elwetrittsche-Jagd‚Äú (Landauian Elwetrittche-Hunt). There is also an Elwetritsche Academy in Pirmasens, a college for ‚ÄûTritschology‚Äú in Dahn and an exhibition with figures of the mythical creatures in the Landauian zoo as well as in the zoo in Kaiserslautern.  Elwetritsch monuments  There are several monuments in the Palatinate: * Dahn: ** Elwetritsche fountain ** Elwetritsche educational trail ** Elwetritsche hiking trail ** Elwetritsche monument in municipal park ** Local carnival club uses Elwetritsche as mascot * Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe: ** Elwetritsche fountain (illustrated) *Wernigerode: **Elwetritsche fountain * Winnweiler: ** Local brewery Bischoff uses Elwetritsche as mascot See also *Skvader *Jackalope *Jenny Haniver *Dahu *Wolpertinger *Snipe hunt References Ollivia Moore: Elwetritsche im Speckhemdchen in Verborgene Wesen 2 (German Edition), Twilightline-Verlag Wasungen (2012).

He is best known for his command of the 14th Brooklyn Regiment and a demi-brigade during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Early life He was born in Manhattan, and his family moved to Brooklyn when he was an infant. He attended Brooklyn Gaslight School with the intention of becoming an accountant, before entering military service. Early career and personal life He was a sergeant by the time he was 18, and a lieutenant by 1847 when he began his association with the 14th Brooklyn, a unit made up primarily of Brooklyn businessmen, tradesmen and firemen. By 1852 he was a lieutenant colonel, and married Annie Cook at the Methodist Church on Hanson Place in Fort Greene. Eventually, Fowler and his wife had three children, two boys and a girl. Military career When the Civil War broke out, Fowler was commander of the 14th Brooklyn, which was stationed in Fort Greene Park. They were deployed to action at the Battle of Bull Run, where their red pants and their fierceness earned them the nickname the \\"Red-Legged Devils\\". Sometime in 1862, Fowler wrote a letter home commenting on the regiment, a bit about the uniforms, and the tactics in which he had to use. It was later placed in the regimental history: > In 1860 the Board of Officers adopted the French 'chasseur' uniform, > consisting of ashy red trousers, white leggings, a blue jacket, red chevrons > and shoulder knots. A fixed to the head was to be a french style kepi with > blue band, red above and blue top. > > Little did the officers of that board dream that the uniform that they then > adopted would become historic, sung of in poets' lays and transferred to the > artist's canvas as that of the \\"red-legged devils,\\" the Brooklyn Fourteenth. Fowler was known to his men as \\"Ned\\", and inspired strong loyalty from them. The regiment fought again at Second Bull Run (the Battle of Manassas), where 860 of its 960 men were lost. Fowler himself took bullets in the thigh and convalesced in Alexandria, Virginia, during which he was promoted to full colonel and named to be the commandant of the hospital. In January 1863, Fowler returned to active duty, and commanded the 14th Brooklyn in the Battle of Gettysburg as part of the First Army Corps. The 14th continued on to fight at the Battle of Mine Run, the Wilderness Campaign and the Battle of Spotsylvania, a total of 22 military engagements. At the end of the 14th's term of service, on June 6, 1864, Fowler was brevetted a brigadier general. Civilian life Fowler returned to Brooklyn, where he lived in Fort Greene and took on the positions of an officer of the Long Island Savings Bank, the treasurer of the Atlantic & Pacific Company, the auditor of the Commercial Cable Company, the chief clerk of the Brooklyn Board of Audit and a member of the Kings County 11th Ward Board of Supervisors. He maintained his connection with the 14th Brooklyn for two years, assisting with soldier's pension funds, and was active in veterans affairs. Fowler died at his home at 47 Brevoort Place on January 16, 1896. His body laid in state at Brooklyn City Hall, and he was buried with full military honors in Green-Wood Cemetery. Statue On May 18, 1902, the City of Brooklyn dedicated a statue of Fowler by Henry Baerer in Fort Greene Park.Fort Greene, by Howard Plitsch, 2010 The statue had deteriorated by the 1960s, and was removed to storage for safekeeping. In 1976 it was reinstalled at a new location, Fowler Square, formerly Lafayette Square, located at the intersection of Lafayette Avenue and Fulton Street at Fort Greene Place. The statue was conserved in 2005, and the square itself was renovated in 2010.\\"Public Plaza Sites\\" on the New York City Department of Transportation website See also *  References  Notes External links * Category:Union Army colonels Category:People of New York (state) in the American Civil War Category:Eastern Iron Brigade Category:1826 births Category:1896 deaths Category:Burials at Green-Wood Cemetery Category:People from Fort Greene, Brooklyn ","title":"Edward Brush Fowler"},{"id":"13345218","text":"HMS Cornwallis was a 74-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 12 May 1813 at Bombay.

Jeep-Willys history in Colombia The first Jeeps (M38 or CJ-2A models) arrived to Colombia in 1946 for military purposes. They were imported by the Colombian Ministry of Defense and soon became very popular among Colombian coffee farmers who saw in this vehicle the needed qualities for the difficult roads in the mountainous region of the country. Besides the transportation of coffee, Jeeps are used to transport many other agricultural products, as well as country workers to places previously accessible only to pack animals. Due to this quality, the Jeeps are also known locally in (or mechanical mules). Jeeps and culture Many families in the Paisa region and Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis own Jeep vehicles, which have become a beloved symbol of the coffee culture. Often the Jeeps have many ornaments, icons, and flashy accessories, in a kitsch style.

Career Vezza was the assistant director of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) and in charge of LCS's Dynamic Modeling (DM) group in the late 1970s when group members Dave Lebling, Marc Blank, Tim Anderson, and Bruce Daniels began creating the game that would become Zork. By 1979, many of the graduating students in the DM group were interested in continuing to work together by establishing a company, and Vezza, who had long wanted to bring together his former students in a commercial venture, agreed to help fund the company, named Infocom. Vezza became a member of the board of directors of Infocom when it was incorporated on June 22, 1979. While the computer game business brought Infocom quick success, Vezza and others on the board were not convinced that computer games would remain a viable market over the long haul and advocated a move into business software. As Infocom began seeking out venture capital firms to invest in the company, the board decided that an actual CEO would be an asset in attracting investment and that an experienced project leader like Vezza would attract more confidence from firms than the younger game designers. As a result, Vezza was named CEO of the company and took on that role beginning in January 1984. As CEO, Vezza was responsible for guiding Infocom's new foray into business software, and oversaw Infocom during a period when rising development costs related to the Cornerstone database project, and feuding between the game and business software sides of the business, created a great strain on the company. In 1985, the failure of Cornerstone to carve out a place in the business world, combined with flat game sales, led to a period of financial difficulty and layoffs. Finally, in 1986 Infocom was sold to rival game company Activision and Vezza stepped down as CEO.

History The origin of the flag is attributed to General Jos√© Mar√≠a Cabal who was in charge of the independentist forces in Valle del Cauca and who in a dream saw virgin Mary wearing a celestial blue and white mantle. The flag was used on June 6, 1811 by the confederate cities of Anserma, Buga, Cali, Caloto, Cartago, Iscuand√©, Popay√°n and Toro when these declared independence from the rest of the country. It was officially adopted on December 31, 1960 by the Department Assembly of Valle del Cauca. Criticism The flag and its significance has generated controversy in Valle del Cauca for its pallid colors and for its religious connotation (Colombia self-proclaimed secularity in the Colombian Constitution of 1991). The flag was adopted by ordinance and not by popular plebiscite, as some argue the colors also misrepresented the people and things of Valle del Cauca.

The campus is on Dares Beach Road and includes the main school building, a gym for basketball games, a football stadium, a baseball field, tennis courts, a soccer field, a lacrosse and field hockey field, and a large auditorium used for school concerts and plays. Additionally, it also includes the Arthur Storer Planetarium, named for the Calvert County resident and the original namesake of Halley's Comet. A vocational education center is adjacent to the main school building. Before moving to its current campus in 1963, Calvert High School used to be along Maryland Route 2/Maryland Route 4. The building once served as a building for Calvert Middle School, a public middle school that serves as a feeder school of Calvert High. Calvert Middle School recently moved from that building and built a new school in Prince Frederick. In 1965, desegregation of the Calvert County Public Schools led to Brooks High School -- the county's then all-black high school -- being merged with Calvert High. Calvert High's school mascot is the Cavaliers. The sports teams compete in the Southern Maryland Athletic Conference. Calvert High's athletic rivals include the neighboring schools of Northern High School, Huntingtown High School, and Patuxent High School. In 2000, the Cavaliers captured the Maryland State Division 3A American football championship under the leadership of head coach Jerry Franks. In 2015, the Calvert High School Varsity Girls Soccer Team also added to Calvert's achievements by winning the Maryland 2A State Championship under the leadership of Dawn Lister and Damon Williams. Calvert High's cross country team has proven to show success in the past few years with their advancements to State matches and Regional Titles. Calvert High and Patuxent High are the only 2A schools in the county. Along with many achievements in sports Calvert high school has had significant success in academic achievements. Such related activities include the success of the Vex robotics team. Calvert has attended the world's competition numerous time and even ranked 5th in their division in years passed. Recently in 2014 one of its teams, 1670d attended the worlds competition in Aneheim, California. In 2015 team 1670a was able to make it as far as the state semifinals. Finally, in 2016 team 1670a placed as the second best alliance in the state and moved on to compete in the world competition held in Louisville, Kentucky. 1670a is now considered the best robotics team in the state. Although the 2017 teams did not make it as far as the state competition, they did have a great run considering the previously mentioned 1670a team had graduated and was no longer available for guidance or competition. One team in particular, team 1670x, was especially notable as an underdog and somewhat of a successor to 1670a. A juvenile student was removed from Calvert High School on Friday and could face several charges after sheriff‚Äôs deputies became alerted to threats he reportedly made Thursday night and found a BB gun in his backpack. On Friday September 22nd, 2018, According to a press release from the Calvert County Sheriff‚Äôs Office as students arrived at school early Friday morning, deputies working on assignment at Calvert High learned of a social media threat made the night prior. The deputies worked with the school administration to investigate the threat and quickly located and isolated the suspected student. A search of his backpack revealed a realistic-looking BB gun. As of 2015, the total attendees of Calvert is 1,166 students total that make up grades nine through twelve. The attendance rate among these students is 93.8%. Out of these 1,166 student in 2015, 591 are female and 575 are male.7% of students are receiving special services for Special Education.

The song was first publicly performed in February 1906, in the Broadway production Abyssinia. The show, which included live camels, premi√®red at the Majestic Theater and continued the string of hits for the vaudeville team of Williams and Walker. \\"Nobody\\" became Bert Williams' signature theme, and the song that he is best remembered for today. It is a doleful and ironic composition, replete with his dry observational wit, and is complemented by Williams' intimate, half-spoken singing style. Williams became so identified with the song that he was obliged to sing it in almost every appearance for the rest of his life. He considered its success both blessing and curse: \\"Before I got through with 'Nobody', I could have wished that both the author of the words and the assembler of the tune had been strangled or drowned... 'Nobody' was a particularly hard song to replace.\\" \\"Nobody\\" remained active in Columbia Records' sales catalogue into the 1930s, and musicologist Tim Brooks estimates that it sold between 100,000 and 150,000 copies, a phenomenally high amount for the era.  Racial context  Bert Williams (left) and George Walker (right) \\"Nobody\\" embodies the struggle that Bert Williams and George Walker went through during their lives both as citizens and performers on the vaudeville stage. As black men living during the Jim Crow era when blacks were openly disenfranchised, Williams and Walker used their platform to protest such flagrant racism. Off the stage, they were accomplished individuals who tried to separate themselves as distinguished and sophisticated; thus, defying the pervasive stereotypes of black men. Traveling as a performer, Williams faced issues with hotels not letting him use the same elevators or facilities as whites, and white performers not wanting to perform with him. He took those experiences to the stage with him, giving the audience his real life that they could relate to. As the businessman of the group, Walker was in charge of managing and handling the dealings of Williams and Walker Co. He likewise experienced the realities of being black in a business that did not cater to black performers. Trying to combat their own realities and the known condition of blacks in America, Williams used the song as a statement. Debuting in Abyssinia, the song was part of an effort to regain legitimacy and agency for the black community. Much like their other shows, Abyssinia was an attempt to bring attention to black excellence, specifically in Africa. The historical Abyssinia, or the Ethiopian empire, was dominant from about 1270 to 1974. Showing reverence to the Empire, Williams and Walker set out to put its dominance on display so that their audience would not only be educated, but also empowered by its greatness. It represented a resurgence of the black community in America, as it was a symbol of greatness. It was also a symbol for the longevity and depth of roots that blacks have, giving black Americans the confidence and mentality to succeed in the midst of oppression. The show Abyssinia was a smash hit, intertwining the depths and gravity of the historical narrative with the common stereotypes, drenched in drama and humor. The Topeka Daily Capital wrote about the shows debut that \\"the complications arising are varied and many, and furnish the theme of Abyssinia, the latest and by far the best vehicle in which these clever colored comedians ever appeared.\\" This musical was one of the highlighted works of their careers, showing off their talent along with their awareness of their common plight, situated within an overarching historical narrative. Williams uses \\"Nobody\\" as the counter to the stereotype that whites had about blacks at the time. During slavery, many stereotypes were formed to justify the racist actions against blacks to keep them at the bottom of the social totem pole. Stemming from images, phrases and common beliefs, the stereotypes held power and weight, as they were the force and the background behind much of the daily encounters that whites had with blacks even after the end of slavery. These stereotypes did not even have to make sense. \\"For instance, an enslaved person forced under violence to work from sunrise to sunset could hardly be described as 'lazy,' yet laziness, as well as characteristics of docility, backwardness, lasciviousness, treachery, and dishonesty, historically became characteristic of African Americans.\\" As social classes were beginning to form, and the middle class was emerging, whites felt pressured to thwart the growth of blacks, using these stereotypes in any way that could be justified. As a result, these beliefs crept their way into the entertainment industry and onto the vaudeville stage, as blackface minstrelsy was becoming increasingly popular. Scholar Alan Trachtenberg asserts that \\"new social roles developed for culture. Changes in social structure, the polarization of rich and poor, and the growth of a salaried middle class anxious about its own opportunity ‚Äî indeed, created the necessity ‚Äî for the healing properties identified within high culture.\\" Bert Williams took note of the changing culture, and used the stereotypes to work both for and against the white people in his audience.  Lyrical implications  Analyzing the lyrics from the mindset of Williams, he takes the realities of poor blacks in America as the theme. Performing on Broadway, he and Walker were able to break racial barriers to gather both blacks and whites in the same theatre. In Dahomey was their debut on Broadway, which gained recognition and publicity, as The New York Times headlined, \\"Williams and Walker Make and Opening at the New York Theatre and Hold It: All Negro Book and Music Played by and All-Negro Cast ‚Äì The Negroes in the Audience Were in Heaven.\\" Using that success, they prided themselves on appealing to the entire social spectrum. Therefore, Williams was intent in making the narrative relatable to blacks that were fortunate enough to be in his audience. Taking on the character of a lowly, lazy, lonely black man who has lived through hardships, he plays into the stereotypes that white people created. Dressed in blackface, as he always did performing alongside Walker, he embraced the racist caricature with the intent to walk the fine lines between humiliation, assimilation and humor. The lyrics are a tale of reality just as much as they are a cry for help. On the surface level, Williams is pleading for direct, personal attention and companionship. However, digging deeper into the context, he is asking for the American society to extend a welcoming hand to blacks. He is revealing much of himself, being vulnerable, genuine all while maintaining his comedic flair. Although the song was published in 1905, the lyrics are similar to a poem \\"The Bachelor's Complaint\\" that appeared in The American Musical Times, Volume 4, Number 6, June 1894, page 8. The first lines read: \\"Returning home at close of day / Who gently chides my long delay, / And by my side delights to stay? / Nobody! \\". No author is given; the magazine editor is D. O. Evans.http://waltercosand.com/CosandScores/Composers%20A-D/American%20Musical%20Times/AMTv4no6.pdf  Lyrics  The lyrics for the song are as follows: :When life seems full of clouds an' rain :and I am filled with naught but pain, :who soothes my thumpin' bumpin' brain ? :Nobody :When winter comes with snow an' sleet, :and me with hunger and cold feet, :who says \\" Ah, here's two bits, go an' eat!\\" :Nobody :I ain't never done nothin' to nobody, :I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time! :And until I get somethin' from somebody, sometime, :I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time! :When I try hard an' scheme an' plan, :to look as good as I can, :who says \\" Ah, look at that handsome man!\\" :Nobody :When all day long things go amiss, :and I go home to find some bliss, :who hands to me a glowin' kiss? :Nobody :I ain't never done nothin' to nobody, :I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time! :And until I get somethin' from somebody, sometime, :I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time! :Nobody, no time!

Roughly speaking, Schilder's theorem gives an estimate for the probability that a (scaled-down) sample path of Brownian motion will stray far from the mean path (which is constant with value 0). This statement is made precise using rate functions. Schilder's theorem is generalized by the Freidlin‚ÄìWentzell theorem for It≈ç diffusions. Statement Let B be a standard Brownian motion in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd starting at the origin, 0 ‚àà Rd; let W denote the law of B, i.e. classical Wiener measure. For Œµ > 0, let WŒµ denote the law of the rescaled process B. Then, on the Banach space C0 = C0([0, T]; Rd) of continuous functions f : [0,T] \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbf{R}^d such that f(0)=0, equipped with the supremum norm *‚àû, the probability measures WŒµ satisfy the large deviations principle with good rate function I : C0 -> R ‚à™ {+‚àû} given by :I(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_{0}^{T}  \\\\dot{\\\\omega}(t) ^{2} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t if œâ is absolutely continuous, and I(œâ) = +‚àû otherwise. In other words, for every open set G ‚äÜ C0 and every closed set F ‚äÜ C0, :\\\\limsup_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\downarrow 0} \\\\varepsilon \\\\log \\\\mathbf{W}_{\\\\varepsilon} (F) \\\\leq - \\\\inf_{\\\\omega \\\\in F} I(\\\\omega) and :\\\\liminf_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\downarrow 0} \\\\varepsilon \\\\log \\\\mathbf{W}_{\\\\varepsilon} (G) \\\\geq - \\\\inf_{\\\\omega \\\\in G} I(\\\\omega). Example Taking Œµ = 1/c2, one can use Schilder's theorem to obtain estimates for the probability that a standard Brownian motion B strays further than c from its starting point over the time interval [0, T], i.e. the probability :\\\\mathbf{W} (C_0 \\\\smallsetminus \\\\mathbf{B}_c (0; \\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\_\\\\infty)) \\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{P} \\\\big[ \\\\ B \\\\_\\\\infty > c \\\\big], as c tends to infinity. Here Bc(0; *‚àû) denotes the open ball of radius c about the zero function in C0, taken with respect to the supremum norm. First note that :\\\\ B \\\\_\\\\infty > c \\\\iff \\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon} B \\\\in A := \\\\left { \\\\omega \\\\in C_0 \\\\mid \\\\omega(t) > 1 \\\\text{ for some } t \\\\in [0, T] \\\\right}. Since the rate function is continuous on A, Schilder's theorem yields :\\\\begin{align} \\\\lim_{c \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left [ \\\\ B \\\\_\\\\infty > c \\\\right] \\\\right )}{c^2} &= \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\varepsilon \\\\log \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left[ \\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon} B \\\\in A \\\\right] \\\\right ) [6pt] &= - \\\\inf \\\\left{ \\\\left. \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_0^T  \\\\dot{\\\\omega}(t) ^2 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t \\\\,\\\\right\\\\, \\\\omega \\\\in A \\\\right} [6pt] &= - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_0^T \\\\frac{1}{T^2} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t [6pt] &= - \\\\frac{1}{2 T}, \\\\end{align} making use of the fact that the infimum over paths in the collection A is attained for œâ(t) = t ‚ÅÑ T. This result can be heuristically interpreted as saying that, for large c and/or large T :\\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left [ \\\\ B \\\\_\\\\infty > c \\\\right] \\\\right )}{c^2} \\\\approx - \\\\frac{1}{2T} \\\\qquad \\\\text{or} \\\\qquad \\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left[ \\\\ B \\\\_\\\\infty > c \\\\right ] \\\\approx \\\\exp \\\\left( - \\\\frac{c^2}{2 T} \\\\right). In fact, the above probability can be estimated more precisely: for B a standard Brownian motion in Rn, and any T, c and Œµ > 0, we have: :\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left[ \\\\sup_{0 \\\\leq t \\\\leq T} \\\\left \\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon} B_t \\\\right  \\\\geq c \\\\right] \\\\leq 4 n \\\\exp \\\\left( - \\\\frac{c^2}{2 n T \\\\varepsilon} \\\\right).

Early life Leroy A. Stafford was born on Greenwood Plantation near Cheneyville, south of Alexandria in south Rapides Parish, Louisiana. He was the eldest son of wealthy land owner Leroy Stafford and his second wife, Elizabeth Calliham. His father died when he was thirteen years old. Stafford was educated at Bardstown, Kentucky, and attended college in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1843, at the age of twenty-one, he returned to Louisiana and married Sarah Catherine Wright, the daughter of Dr. Jesse D. Wright and the former Sarah R. Grimball.Sources cited by the Louisiana Historical Association include George Mason Graham Stafford (1875-1958) (grandson of General Stafford), General Leroy Augustus Stafford, His Forebears and Descendants (1943); Ezra J. Warner, Generals in Gray (1959); Clement A. Evans, Confederate Military History, 13 vols. (1899). The Staffords had ten children--George Waters, Sally, Elizabeth Eloise, David Theophilus, Cornelia Knox, Julia Laura, Jesse Wright, Rosalind, Leroy Augustus Jr., and Kate Keary. Military life Stafford operated plantations in Rapides Parish for a couple of decades, and served as the sheriff of the parish in 1846‚Äì47 before leaving for the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He enlisted in the \\"Rapides Volunteers\\" (Company E, 3d Louisiana Infantry Regiment) and later served in Captain Ben McCullough's Texas Rangers. With Louisiana's secession in 1861, Stafford formed the \\"Stafford Guards\\", a militia unit that was soon mustered into Confederate service as Company B, 9th Louisiana Infantry with Stafford as its first captain. Stafford rose through the ranks and became the regiment's colonel in early 1862 when Richard Taylor was promoted. With the death of Brig. Gen. William E. Starke early in the Battle of Antietam, Stafford was elevated temporarily to command of the brigade. He suffered a minor wound in his foot during the battle, but soon recovered. In the reorganization of the Army of Northern Virginia in the fall of 1862, Stafford and the 9th Louisiana regiment were reassigned to Harry T. Hays brigade, the Louisiana Tigers. Stafford served at the battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg in 1863. In October of that year, he was promoted to brigadier general and assigned command of the 2nd Louisiana Brigade. Death and legacy Stafford was mortally wounded on May 5, 1864, at the Battle of the Wilderness in northern Virginia. A Mini√© ball pierced his spinal cord. He was carried to the Confederate capital city of Richmond, where he died three days later in the Spottswood Hotel. He was one of three Confederate generals killed in the Wilderness, along with John M. Jones and Micah Jenkins. Stafford left behind a wife and nine of their ten children. He was buried with military honors in Richmond in Hollywood Cemetery. Among the attendees at his funeral was Confederate President Jefferson Davis. In 1886, his remains were exhumed and reinterred on his Greenwood Plantation in Rapides Parish.Find A Grave website Honors The Gen. Leroy A. Stafford Camp #358 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Alexandria, Louisiana, is named in honor of the fallen general. The Gen. Leroy Stafford Camp #3 of the United Confederate Veterans in Shreveport, Louisiana, was named for General Stafford as well. It was formed in 1891 and existed until the last member died in 1944. In its 53 years of existence, over 250 Confederate Veterans were members. Stafford's son, David Theophilus Stafford, was later the sheriff of Rapides Parish, having served for four terms from 1888 to 1904. Many of Stafford's descendants were named after him.

It is particularly suited for use in exploratory data analysis. The method was proposed by John W. Sammon in 1969. It is considered a non-linear approach as the mapping cannot be represented as a linear combination of the original variables as possible in techniques such as principal component analysis, which also makes it more difficult to use for classification applications. Denote the distance between ith and jth objects in the original space by \\\\scriptstyle d^{*}_{ij}, and the distance between their projections by \\\\scriptstyle d^{}_{ij}. Sammon's mapping aims to minimize the following error function, which is often referred to as Sammon's stress or Sammon's error: :E = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i The minimization can be performed either by gradient descent, as proposed initially, or by other means, usually involving iterative methods. The number of iterations needs to be experimentally determined and convergent solutions are not always guaranteed. Many implementations prefer to use the first Principal Components as a starting configuration. The Sammon mapping has been one of the most successful nonlinear metric multidimensional scaling methods since its advent in 1969, but effort has been focused on algorithm improvement rather than on the form of the stress function. The performance of the Sammon mapping has been improved by extending its stress function using left Bregman divergence and right Bregman divergence.

Equity accounting is usually applied where an investor entity holds 20‚Äì50% of the voting stock of the associate company, and therefore has significant influence on the latter's management. Under International Financial Reporting Standards, equity method is also required in accounting for joint ventures. The investor records such investments as an asset on its balance sheet. The investor's proportional share of the associate company's net income increases the investment (and a net loss decreases the investment), and proportional payments of dividends decrease it. In the investor‚Äôs income statement Equity accounting may also be appropriate where the investor has a smaller interest, depending on the nature of the actual relationship between the investor and investee. Control of the investee, usually through ownership of more than 50% of voting stock, results in recognition of a subsidiary, whose financial statements must be consolidated with the parent's. The ownership of less than 20% creates an investment position, carried at historic book or fair market value (if available for sale or held for trading) in the investor's balance sheet.

At that time, Arab airline operators were generally not included in the major airline alliances, partly because of their relatively small market share. As well as coordinating schedules, the Arabesk carriers consolidated joint fuel purchasing under the AACO umbrella, and other supplies.
