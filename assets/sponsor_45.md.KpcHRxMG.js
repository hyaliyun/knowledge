It was pawned in 1625 and is considered lost. Description The jewel was described in a 1606 inventory as follows: The National Galleries of Scotland collection includes a 1604 portrait by John de Critz of James wearing the Mirror of Great Britain as a hat jewel. He wore and was painted wearing other jewels in a similar fashion, such as the Three Brothers, and a \\"feather\\" of gold set with diamonds.Maria Hayward, Stuart Style (Yale, 2020), p. 211. History When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 after a 45-year reign, she was the last direct descendant of King Henry VIII, and the 'virgin queen' had been unmarried and childless. King James VI of Scotland seemed to have the best claim on the throne through his great-grandmother Margaret Tudor, and from as early as 1601, English politicians had maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare for the succession. When James VI ascended to the thrones of England and Ireland as James I in 1603, he was the first monarch to realise the promise of the 1502 Treaty of Perpetual Peace, which had brought the Scottish House of Stuart into the line of succession of the English House of Tudor. To mark the momentousness of the occasion of this \\"Union of the Crowns\\", several pieces of art were commissioned, chief among them the Mirror. The jewel was created around 1603 by an unknown master craftsman—possibly the most well- known of James' goldsmiths, Scotsman George Heriot, who had followed the king from Edinburgh to London. To assemble the pieces of the Mirror, James had likely ordered existing Elizabethan jewellery to be broken up. Sancy diamond The jewel was created in gold with five main stones set into it: four pale diamonds and a red ruby. The ruby and one of the diamonds were table-cut, while two further diamonds were lozenges. One of them was known as the Great H of Scotland or the Great Harry and had belonged to James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, who had been gifted the stone by Henry II of France.. The final stone—dangling underneath the four other jewels, as can be seen in the 1604 painting—was the Sancy diamond. The Sancy had originally belonged to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, just like the Three Brothers, another of James' crown jewels. The diamond had acquired its name when it was bought in the 16th century by French diplomat Nicolas de Harlay, seigneur de Sancy, who eventually sold it to James. The Mirror was also decorated with two large pearls and a number of smaller diamonds.Roy Strong, \\"Three Royal Jewels\\", in The Tudor and Stuart Monarchy, pp. 69–75. A contemporary source estimated the total cost of the Mirror at over £70,000. James would typically wear the piece as a hat jewel, with the ruby at the nine o'clock position to the left of the diamonds. When James died in March 1625, the jewel passed to his son Charles I. In his decades-long struggle with the Parliament of England that would ultimately lead to the First English Civil War, Charles continuously asserted the divine right of kings, which meant personal ownership of crown jewels such as a Mirror. Plagued by financial difficulties, in 1625 Charles took the drastic step to pawn away several important items of jewellery in the Netherlands, most likely in The Hague, one of the centres of the jewel trade. While Charles managed to eventually scrape together enough money to redeem certain jewels some 14 years later in 1639, the same could not be said for the Mirror. The jewel was likely sold to Hague jeweller and gemstone dealer Thomas Cletcher, who recorded an item very similar to the Mirror in his sketchbook with the note that it had been \\"commissioned by Coninc Jacobus\\". The theory is bolstered by the fact that it was also Cletcher who again acted as middleman or buyer when Charles' wife Henrietta Maria attempted to sell off even more of the crown jewels in 1644. The Mirror's journey as a distinct piece of jewellery ends after the sale, however. It was split up and its constituent stones sold or re-used. The two remaining pearls were sold off in 1630 by James Maxwell, a groom of the bedchamber.Foedera, vol. 8 part 3 (Hague, 1742), pp. 88-94: Calendar State Papers Domestic: Charles I: 1629-1631 (London, 1860), pp. 216-7. The Sancy diamond was the only piece of the Mirror to ever be reclaimed, but it was eventually pawned again by Charles' son James II, after which it became part of the French Crown Jewels. The Sancy is now in the collection at the Louvre.

The week of events is scheduled the last week of January each year. As an organization it does not promote one form of educational choice over another, but rather contends that parents should have and make choices in the best interest of their children. History The week consists of independently organized events, both large and small, in schools, state capitols, and other public meetings featuring the movement's signature yellow scarves. According to the National School Choice Week website, \\"more than 131,000 NSCW events have been planned across the country\\" since 2011. A number of notable celebrities and public officials have participated in events during National School Choice Week. For example, in January 2014, former WNBA basketball player Lisa Leslie joined with U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor for an event at Friendship Chamberlain Elementary School in Washington, D.C. In 2013, the Jonas Brothers kicked off National School Choice Week with a concert in Phoenix. In 2014, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee at an event at Minute Maid Park in Houston. In 2015, National School Choice Week opened with a nationally televised event in Jacksonville, Florida, featuring speeches NFL star Desmond Howard, Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, and a video greeting by US Senator Marco Rubio. In 2018, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos spoke at a National School Choice Week event on Capitol Hill. National education organizations that have participated in the week's events include the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, Magnet Schools of America, the Council on American Private Education, the National Coalition for Public School Options, the Home School Legal Defense Association, the American Federation for Children, the Association of American Educators, the Black Alliance for Educational Options, the Children's Scholarship Fund, Choice Media, Education Reform Now, Families Empowered, the Foundation for Excellence in Education, and the 50 State Campaign for Achievement Now. Governors and mayors across the country have issued resolutions and proclamations in support of the movement. The list of governors includes Bobby Jindal, John Hickenlooper, Scott Walker, and Martin O'Malley. Well-known mayors such as Marty Walsh and Kevin Johnson have also voiced their support. From 2015-2019, the US Senate has passed a commemorative resolution recognizing School Choice Week, and U.S. President Donald J. Trump issued similar proclamations in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

It was linked to both the paper mill at Kemsley and Sittingbourne Paper Mill by the Bowaters Paper Railway, a light railway network. Part of this is preserved as the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway. The dock facility was damaged in the 1953 flood event. Parts of the dock were used by Sheerness Steelworks from 1973 until the closure of the steel works in 2002. After Finnish based paper company Metsa Serla bought the paper making plants of Bowater in 1998, the decision was made to sell the docks. Operations Ridham Dock is on The Swale covering an area of .

There are walks with excellent views to be enjoyed from the camp. With a sandy bottom and in the right conditions, the bay provides good anchorage for many vessels of varied size, but novice sailors to the area are recommended to take extra care if the weather is changeable and deteriorating.

History and design  The SY class was the last major class of steam locomotives to be produced anywhere in the world with last being built in 1999. The design however is based on the earlier Japanese-built JF6 Class 2-8-2s which itself was based on a locomotive type built by the American Locomotive Company in the 1920s for use in Korea. The SY is one of the few steam locomotives still found in active service in the 21st Century, mostly working in coal and steel industries but can also be found heading commuter trains from time to time. The last steam locomotive built in China is SY1772, completed in 1999. Export The SY class were also among the few Chinese steam locomotives to be exported. In 1989 and 1991, three SYs were constructed for tourist railroads in the United States, SY1647m for the Valley Railroad, SY1658m for the Knox and Kane Railroad were built in 1989 at a cost of $300,000 with a third being built in 1991 for the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway. This third one was lost at sea during shipment in the Indian Ocean when the ship it was on sunk. The Susquehanna later purchased SY1647m from the Valley Railroad renumbering it 142. The 142 ran throughout the NYS&W; system until its transfer to the New York Susquehanna & Western Technical & Historical Society in 2003 and now operates on the Belvidere and Delaware River Railway in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. SY1658m was renumbered 58 in the mid to late 1990s. After the main draw of the Knox and Kane Railroad, the Kinzua Bridge collapsed in mid 2003, the 58 was withdrawn from service and moved with other equipment to an engine house in Kane, Pennsylvania. On the morning of 16 March 2008, the 58 was damaged when the engine house it was stored in was burned by arson. The 58 was purchased later that year by the Valley Railroad at an auction. Upon purchase, the 58 was renumbered 3025 and was given a complete rebuild which included cosmetic alterations to make it resemble a New Haven 2-8-2. One was bought by the Korean National Railroad in 1994, numbered 901, and operated for excursion trains. It has been out of service since 2012.

She specialized in landscapes and still-lifes. Biography Her father, Jacob Eduard van Heemskerck van Beest, was an officer in the Royal Netherlands Navy who also painted seascapes and landscapes. Her first art lessons came from him. She later took private lessons from two local artists before attending classes at the Royal Academy of Art from 1897 to 1901, where she studied with Ferdinand Hart Nibbrig. Landscape with a Sun, c. 1915, National Gallery of Art Her first contact with Modern art came in Paris, where she took lessons from Eugène Carrière.Brief biography @ Kubisme. She remained in France until 1904, then went to live with her sister, Lucie, and was introduced to the art collector, Marie Tak van Poortvliet, who became her lifelong friend and later built a studio for her in the garden of her home. After 1906, she spent her Summers in Domburg, where she came into contact with avant-garde painters such as Piet Mondriaan and Jan Toorop, who offered her advice. Around 1911, she was briefly interested in Cubism. Shortly after, she became involved in Anthroposophy, possibly through the influence of her former teacher, Nibbrig, who was a Theosophist. She then became an avid follower of Der Sturm, an avant-garde art magazine founded by Herwarth Walden, and turned increasingly to Abstraction. In 1913, she attended the \\"\\" in Berlin, where she met Walden and started what would be a lifelong correspondence. Thanks to his efforts, her work was popular in Germany, while it remained somewhat ignored in her home country. After 1916, she developed an interest in stained glass windows, designing them for the naval barracks and the Municipal Health Department building in Amsterdam, as well as private residences. From 1922, she lived in Domburg with her old friend and patron, Tak van Poortvliet. She died suddenly, from an attack of angina. Both Tak van Poortvliet and Walden mounted exhibitions of her work, in Amsterdam and Berlin respectively. In 2005, a major retrospective was held at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag.

Prehistory of Mackinac Island  For millennia before the arrival of Europeans, Mackinac Island was home and meeting place for Chippewa (Anishinaabeg), Huron, Menominee, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, Ottawa, and other Native American Indian tribes. They enjoyed aurora borealis displays, pure fresh water, ice-locked winters, quiet snow storms, spring trees and birds, pleasant summers, and autumn leaves. These were described in a reminiscence by an Indian chief: “Great Spirit allowed a peaceful stillness to dwell around thee, when only light and balmy winds were permitted to pass over thee, hardly ruffling the mirror surface of the waters that surrounded thee; or to hear by evening twilight, the sound of the Giant Fairies as they, with rapid step and giddy whirl, dance their mystic dance on thy limestone battlements. Nothing then disturbed thy quiet and deep solitude but the chippering of birds and the rustling of the leaves of the silver-barked birch.”Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians, History & Culture Retrieved 2014-02-04.Michigan Genealogy on the Web, USGenWeb Project (MIGenWeb); History of Cheboygan and Mackinac Counties, G.

The British took it over in 1763, after defeating the French in the Seven Years' War - their government ceded their territories in North America east of the Mississippi River to the British. Finally, in 1780 the mission was relocated to Mackinac Island, where the British had purchased property from the Indians for £5,000.

Captain Robertson built a small summer house on a high limestone outcropping less than a mile away from the Fort at the southeast corner of the island (today's Mission Point). This little building was the first recorded structure at Mission Point. It was frequented by Robertson, his son, and fellow officers. Reportedly, no hospitality or entertainment there was complete without pipes, cigars, and wine. Robertson was served by his household slaves, Jean and Marie-Jean Bonga. Among their children was Pierre Bonga, who became a noted fur trader with the British Northwest Company and later with the American Fur Company. Robertson freed these slaves when he was reassigned from Fort Mackinac. They stayed and the parents opened a small hotel. Robertson commanded Fort Mackinac through 1787, when he left for a posting as major in the British army in Montreal, Quebec. Eventually he became a colonel in the army and amassed 5,000 acres in land grants for himself and his four children. After some years the cliff collapsed, dropping the summer house 127 feet down to the road and lake below. The remaining blunt, precipitous cliff came to be called ‘Robertson’s Folly’ and later (for unknown reasons) Robinson's Folly. Many tales have been attached to the site.Dwight H. Kelton (1893).

The United Foreign Missionary Society founded a Protestant mission on Mackinac Island in 1822.Wood (1918). Historic Mackinac, Volume 1 (of 2)., p. 399 The objective was to train Indian youth as teachers of English, Christianity and majority American ways, and as interpreters. To support this mission, the US government transferred 12 acres at the southeast end of the island to the Society. The Connecticut Missionary Society sent Rev. William Montague Ferry to the island, and he opened the school with twelve Indian children on Nov. 3, 1823. He was assisted by his wife Amanda White Ferry and Elizabeth McFarland. The school building was framed and enclosed by workers from Detroit, using timbers obtained from a sawmill on Mill Creek (6 mi SE of current day Mackinaw City). By 1825, construction of the 2-story ‘Mission House’ was completed by Martin Heydenburk, one of the school's teachers. Because the island had no Protestant church, the east wing of Mission House was fitted with a movable partition so that on Sundays it became a chapel. Enrollment soon averaged 150 Native American pupils per year with >100 receiving free board, room, and clothing from the mission family. The southeast point of Mackinac Island became known as Mission Point.Rev. Meade C. Williams, D.

Historic Mackinac, Volume 1 (of 2), p. 506 fold-out. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1918 Designed as a residence and boarding school, Mission House was also home for the mission families. Pupils at the school were gathered from tribes around the upper Great Lakes and headwaters of the Mississippi, as well as from more than 1000 miles away. A total of more than 500 Indian girls and boys plus children of mission families were educated at the school. The area was a peaceable gathering place for many tribes, with as many as 1500–2000 individuals trading and engaging in friendly companionship. Mackinac Island was also the headquarters of John Jacob Astor's monopoly, the American Fur Company. Mission House operated successfully for a decade. After the American government began deporting some of the tribes to reservations west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s, the school had difficulty recruiting students. In 1834 Rev. Ferry moved to Grand Haven, MI and, in 1836, the missionary society sold the acreage at Mission Point. Astor retired from the fur trade to invest in New York City real estate to great success. In the later 19th century, European-American visitors began using the island as a summer resort. The mission was formally given up in 1837 when the State of Michigan was admitted to the United States. Edward Franks bought the unused Mission building in 1845, added a third story, and reopened it as Mission House Hotel in 1849. Mission House was owned and operated by the Franks family until 1939. They sold it and the hotel was converted to a rooming house. In 1946 the Hon. Miles and Margaret Phillimore bought the property, and provided quarters for summer visitors at Moral Re-Armament meetings. In 1965 it was deeded to Mackinac College (1966–1970) and used as a ski hut. After Mackinac College closed in 1970, it was briefly owned by the Cathedral of Tomorrow. In 1977, Mission House was acquired by Mackinac Island State Park, which restored it and uses it to house summer employees of the park.National Historic Landmark Nomination Mackinac Island, amended January 2000.

In 1882, Alanson Sheley (1809–1892) had two cottages built on Mission Point east of the Mission House (then the Mission House Hotel). A cottage was built by Robert Doud; today's Mission Point Theater was built to the west of its site (below). The second was Cedar Point cottage, located in the courtyard just northeast of today's Great Hall (below). When Sheley died, Cedar Point cottage, which had served as a summer cottage for the family, went to the Brooks family. The cottage built by Doud went to the Clark family, who later sold it to the Faren family, when it became known as the Faren Cottage.Obituaries, “Margaret Goodenough VanDusen, Died Thursday, August 18, 2011” ‘‘Grosse Pointe News’’, 2011-8-18.

This photograph is on display in the MRA Exhibit, which is located on the fourth floor of the former film studio (below) at Mission Point Resort. Cedar Point cottage was later demolished. A third cottage owned by Jimmie Francis was also located at Mission Point. This cottage was between the Studio and the Great Hall complex (below). In late 1965 it was torn down. The site was excavated with the intent to build a thrust stage theater. This theater was not built. Eventually an outdoor swimming pool was constructed on the site.  1915 map  In 1915 Mackinac Island was mapped by Morgan H. Wright, E. M. of Marquette, MI (copyright Edwin O. Wood, 1915). Identified by name on the map are both Robinson's Folly and Mission Point. Along the Mission Point shoreline, the south-south-east shore is labeled Ferry Beach and the east- south-east shore is labeled Peshtigo Beach. This map also shows the jetty leading to present-day Frank's Street at the west end of Mission Point. Comparing this map with a present-day Google Maps image, the field at Mission Point has apparently doubled in size due to the deposition of excavated limestone from building construction on the Point.  MRA arrives (1942)  In 1942, a multi-national group, friends of the Moral Re-Armament (MRA), led by Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman began meeting together on Mackinac Island. As the number of guests increased, they rented the dilapidated Island House hotel for $1; they renovated it as a conference center. In subsequent years, friends of MRA purchased and restored numerous cottages and homes on the island, including: Mission House (Miles Phillimore), Mapleview (Harold Sack), Small Point (‘Faren Cottage,’ Norman Schwab), Vrooman Cottage (Lee Vrooman), Stonecliffe, Bennett Hall, Chateau Beaumont, Pine Cottage, La Chance, Reid House, Eastman Building, Webster House, and Bonnie Doone. Thousands of MRA conference visitors came to the island each summer. Their business provided employment for island residents but also crowded regular summer tourists. After deliberations with the island's City Council, MRA representatives eventually agreed that they would confine MRA development to the eastern end of the island.Morris Martin. 2001. Always a Little Further, Tucson, AZ: Elm Street Press: Tucson, Arizona, 2001, p. 119. In 1952 MRA began developing the Mission Point cottages and property. They began with raising a tent near the Cedar Point and Faren cottages. In the summer of 1952, it was replaced with an open-sided shed. This was called Cedar Lodge and served as a temporary conference and dining hall. By the summer of 1953, the lodge was walled in, using timbers cut from the Stonecliffe property. Later this was the first building around which the Great Hall complex was built (below).  Mission Point Theater (1955)  The Mission Point Theater, designed by William Woollett of Los Angeles, and situated between Mission House (left) and Faren Cottage (right), opened in 1955. Groundbreaking ceremonies at Mission Point were held by the MRA in October 1954, when 150-year-old Norway pine logs were cut and brought in from nearby Bois Blanc Island. Island resident Charles Francis was foreman of the construction crew. The logs were towed across the stormy waters of Lake Huron and floated onto the Mission Point shore before the straits froze for the winter. They were trimmed into 60-foot roof trusses for the Mission Point Theater. In addition, 45 tons of native stone were brought in by boat for building and fireplace construction. Other construction materials were stockpiled on the island. During the winter, supplies were carried across the ice by motor sled or horse-drawn sleigh, or flown to the island by four-seater plane and transported on a horse-drawn carriage to Mission Point. The work provided year-round employment for island residents and MRA volunteers. Initially a sturdy old barn (the Curry Barn) located between the Theater and Faren Cottage was attached to the east side of the Theater.

In 1959, when plans were made to build a studio, the barn was put on wheels and relocated to the west side of the Theater. It was attached to the side of the stage and fly gallery, and integrated into the structure of the completed Theater. In 1965 MRA deeded the theater to Mackinac College, an institution legally independent of MRA and chartered by the Michigan Board of Education.Martin (2001). Always a Little Further, pp. 203-204Daniel Sack. Moral Re-Armament, p. 186. Palgrave Macmillan: New York, New York, 2009. Professors and students at the college used the theater for drama and music classes and performances. When Mackinac College closed in 1970, TV evangelist Rex Humbard purchased the building. He incorporated it into his new, nondenominational Bible college. Subsequently, he began using the theater and other buildings as a vacation resort. In 1977 Humbard sold the property. The theater was part of the newly named Mackinac Hotel and Conference Center. In late 1987 the theater was sold to John Shufelt, and in 2014 to Dennert O. and Suzanne Ware. It is now used as the Center for the Arts at Mission Point Resort and operated by the Mackinac Arts Council. It screens mainstream movies from May through October, showing films every evening.Mission Point Resort Retrieved 2014-02-04 Retrieved 2014-02-04  Great Hall Complex (1956)  By 1964 the Great Hall Complex includes the tepee-shaped Great Hall ringed by kitchens, dining halls, and residences. In the winter of 1955, immediately after construction of the Theater, MRA workers began building the Great Hall complex at Mission Point (64,732 ft2). It was to serve as a convention center and residence hall for summer MRA meetings. It surrounded Cedar Point cottage and included a tepee-shaped Great Hall, lobbies, porches, kitchens, dining rooms, meeting rooms, and residence halls (48,330 ft2) named “building A” and “building B” (250 beds in 150 rooms). Cedar Point cottage was eventually torn down, and the Great Hall complex was dedicated on September 24, 1956. A three-story connector between buildings A and B was added during the winter of 1958. Many of the floors of the Great Hall complex are heated, and the complex accommodates 1000 people. The Great Hall complex is the largest single indoor space on Mackinac Island. It was constructed by 210 tradesmen from Mackinac Island and across Michigan. The teepee-shaped Great Hall features 51-foot logs cut from one of the last stands of virgin Norway pine in the Tahquamenon Falls State Park in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The structure was designed by architect, William Woollett; its 16 log trusses converge at a height of 36 feet (11 m). The floor space equals approximately 7000 ft2. A globe of the world was affixed in the peak. Construction began with the delivery of 3000 tons of supplies and equipment in 1955 before the straits froze for the winter. People on the project said that construction nearly came to a standstill in March 1956, when lumber had been used and the straits were still locked in ice. Over a relatively warm weekend, the wind blew ice clear of the main channel between the island and the mainland. Workers dynamited ice in the shipway, the 36-inch-thick ice by the mainland was sawed through, the sun shone, the ice gave, and the supply barge Beaver, manned by a volunteer crew, broke through to Mission Point. Over 24 hours, 100 tons of lumber and other materials were brought out to Mission Point. Soon ice began to form again, but with the additional supplies, the construction continued to completion. In the spring, the Stouffer's Corporation provided furniture for the dining rooms, Lee Carpets supplied extensive wall-to-wall carpeting, and Mackinaw City's stonemason Friedrich Grebe built the fireplaces and much of the landscaping stonework.Film produced by Moral Re-Armament, 1956.

In 1956 after the Great Hall complex was completed, Woollett reportedly learned an Indian legend about the Great Tepee from an islander. This legend said that the Great Spirit would one day gather nations under a great tepee, or wigwam, and together they would find the secret of peace. This story is consistent with reminiscences of people who were present at the time. It is also consistent with a newspaper report in which Howard Santigo, grandson of a Mackinac Island Chippewa Indian chief, recounted this same legend of the Great Spirit. In 1893, D.H. Kelton related a similar tale in which the ‘suffering ones’ of every race and clime would be invited to draw their canoes up onto the eastern shore of Mackinac Island, pass through Arch Rock, and meet in a wigwam built of the tallest trees (home of the great spirit Gitche Manitou). This tale was repeated by E. O. Wood, who suggested in 1918 that the wigwam was transmuted into Sugar Loaf rock.Dwight H. Kelton. 1893. Annals of Fort Mackinac. John W.

Every spring and summer for a decade after its construction, the Great Hall complex attracted thousands of MRA conference delegates from the US, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Then, in 1965, the Great Hall complex was deeded over to Mackinac College, an institution legally independent of MRA and chartered by the Michigan Board of Education. From 1966 to 1970 the College was in operation and the Great Hall complex was used year-round. Graduation ceremonies for the Charter Class students at the college were held there in June 1970.\\"Environmental School Hopes to Take over College; ...29 Degrees Conferred by Loyal President.\\" Week of June 28 – July 4, 1970.

West Residence (Straits Lodge) (1957)  In 1957 the West Residence was built to serve international conferences. Designed by William Woollett (Los Angeles) and Rudi Barraud (Lucerne, Switzerland), it Later provided Mackinac College with administrative offices and dormitory rooms. Since then it has functioned as a hotel. In the foreground is Mission Church steeple. The West Residence (112,300 ft2, now called the Straits Lodge) was constructed by MRA workers in 1956–1957 to expand lodging for MRA summer conferences. Residence architect William Woollett was friends with the owner of the Mackinac Island Grand Hotel, W. S. Woodfill. He knew that Woodfill was proud of owning “the largest porch in the world” (660 ft). So out of friendship for him the West Residence was designed to be one foot shorter than the porch of the Grand Hotel. It has 400 beds in 225 rooms. The completed three-story West Residence was finished with brick and limestone, having a two-story high entryway with a five-foot (1.5 m) marble-paneled fireplace (Johnson Hall). The Residence accommodated many thousands of conference visitors in the decade after it opened. In 1965 the West Residence was deeded over to Mackinac College, an institution legally independent of MRA and chartered by the Michigan Board of Education.Morris Martin. 2001. Always a Little Further. Elm Street Press: Tucson, Arizona.pp. 203-204. From 1966 to 1970 the college used the building as the men's dormitory. The basement of the Residence housed the college switchboard, photographic darkroom, laundry, finance offices, and administrative offices. After Mackinac College closed in 1970, TV evangelist Rex Humbard purchased the building for use as part of a nondenominational Bible college. In 1977 Humbard sold the property and it became part of the Mackinac Hotel and Conference Center. In late 1987 it was sold to John Shufelt, and in 2014 to present owners Dennert O. and Suzanne Ware. Currently called the Straits Lodge, it has been painted white.  Film Studio-Fine Arts building (1960)  The Mission Point Film Studio and Fine Arts Building was completed in 1960. Designed by Edwin B. Cromwell of Ginocchio-Cromwell Associates, Little Rock, Arkansas, it has been used in filming several films, as a performance studio, and as a gymnasium. The studio tower for many years housed the Mission Point historical museum. The Film Studio-Fine Arts Building (86,287 ft2) was constructed by 250 workers from many countries who volunteered their services to MRA. At the time it was built, the Studio had the second largest sound stage in the world and the second largest television studio in America. A United Press International reporter claimed that the saga of its building was “the greatest news story of our age.” MRA constructed the Studio to accommodate filming and processing of its movies and television programs. Quantities of materials and technological aid were donated by RCA, Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company, Clancy Stage Rigging, and others. The sound stage (80 ft. x 120 ft.) was poured in one all-night mid-winter session. The studio building contains two major sound stages, rooms for rehearsal, music, orchestra, costume designing, sewing, storage, set design, props, hairdressing, make-up, dressing, art, and sound mixing. In the 1960s these rooms were fully furnished, in addition to a huge costume department, lighting switchboard, laboratories for film processing and editing, and construction shops. The studio has a 108 ft. glassed-in tower that from 2013 until 2016 was the Mission Point historical museum.Mission Point historical museum Retrieved 2014-06-11. Movies that were filmed and produced in the Studio include The Crowning Experience (MRA), Decision at Midnight (1963, MRA), Voice of the Hurricane (1964, MRA), and Somewhere in Time (1980, Universal Pictures). In summer 1965 the Studio's sound stage was the site for original performances of the musical show Sing-Out ’65, when ~7,000 young people from around the world were meeting for summer MRA conferences.McGee, Frank. 2007. A Song for the World, p. 2. Santa Barbara: Many Roads Publishing. Seating was brought in for audiences of ~1000 at the weekly Sing-Out shows. In the fall of 1965 the cast of the show began traveling throughout the US and Asia. In 1966, Sing-Out changed its name to Up With People and expanded into several international musical casts emphasizing personal change that could lead to social, economic and political change.Allen, David B., Hoar, Robin, & Everson, Karin (Eds). 1966.

After Mackinac College closed in 1970, TV evangelist Rex Humbard purchased the Studio and other buildings to use for religious education. In 1977 Humbard sold the property. For the 1979 summer season, Universal Studios leased the sound stage to produce the motion picture Somewhere in Time starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. The entire cast and crew of the movie were hosted by “The Inn on Mackinac,” then owners of the Mission Point property. In late 1987 the property was sold to John Shufelt, and in 2014 to present owners Dennert O. and Suzanne Ware.  Peter Howard Memorial Library (1966)  Use of the Studio as a library and classroom building had been disallowed by the Mackinac fire marshal,Morris Martin. 2001. Always a Little Further. Elm Street Press: Tucson, Arizona.p. 206, 210. so construction of a library for Mackinac College (1966–1970) was a priority. In the fall of 1965 a $1,500,000 gift from Mr. and Mrs. W. Van Alan Clark (hon. Chairman of Avon Products, Inc.) jump-started planning for the Peter Howard Memorial Library (capacity 100,000 books; 36,000 ft2), named for the British journalist, playwright, and author who was (briefly) head of MRA (born 1908 – died 1965). The lawn just south of Huron Street at Mission Point was chosen as the site for the library. In 1964-65 the lawn had been a playing field for athletic games at summer MRA conferences. The library was designed by Edwin B. Cromwell of Ginocchio, Cromwell Associates, Little Rock, Arkansas. The construction crew included men from the U.S., Canada, Japan, and other countries (see details in Clark Conference Center, below). It was a three-story building with an overhanging roof canopy and elongated dormer windows; on the 3rd floor these windows provided long views of Lake Huron and Round Island. Icicles hung from the roof in the winter. In 1966 when Mackinac College opened its doors, over 10,000 books were stocked in the library. In addition to books, stacks, and book repair areas, the 3-story library provided classrooms, language labs, and study areas.\\"Students of Mackinac College\\". 1967.

Through disuse, the library fell into disrepair due to leakage and mildew.

By 1970 the water table was rising into the basement.NOAA Great Lakes Water Level Dashboard Retrieved 2017-05-01. Due to these problems, the building was torn down between 1990 and 1992.Mackinac College Webline Photographs from Mackinac College reunions  Clark Conference Center for the Arts and Sciences (1968)  The Clark Center for Arts and Sciences (left) and Peter Howard Memorial Library (right, torn down c.1990), Mackinac College.\\"Mackinac College\\", Mackinac Parks By 1967, Mackinac College (1966–1970) at Mission Point needed conference rooms, science labs, and more classrooms. This led to the construction of the Clark Center for the Arts and Sciences (81,057 ft2), which was also designed by Edwin B. Cromwell. It was paid for by donations from Mr. and Mrs. Van Alan Clark (hon. Chairman of Avon Products, Inc.). Construction supervisors reported that the Clark Center and the Peter Howard Library were built by more than 325 volunteer workers from 13 different countries. Room, board, and travel expenses for these workers were covered by the college. Included were 115 Native Americans from tribal groups across the United States and Canada. Twenty-four volunteers came from South Korea, 16 from Japan, 9 from Denmark, 8 from Jamaica, 7 from Indonesia, 2 from Finland and 1 each from Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and Trinidad and Tobago. Some were skilled tradesmen who trained others in the skills of their trades. Many reported that living and working with others from such diverse backgrounds developed their respect for cultural, racial and national differences. Some eventually became students at the college. Construction of the Clark Center continued through the fall and winter of 1967, and the building was ready for use in Mackinac College's third academic year, September 1968. Located directly in front of the Theater and Fine Arts Building, the Clark Center's 18-inch-thick concrete roof supports a carriage driveway leading from the Mission House and West Residence buildings to the Great Hall. This rooftop plaza commands a sweeping view of playing fields and the Straits of Mackinac. During the college years, the building included 30 classrooms, laboratories, offices, lounges, a 300-seat lecture-recital hall, and a 150-seat natural science demonstration room. The Clark Center featured prominently in the 1970 graduation ceremonies for the Charter Class of Mackinac College. In 1971 the building was sold with the rest of the campus to TV evangelist Rex Humbard. In 1977 Humbard sold the center and other campus property to the Mackinac Hotel and Conference Center. In late 1987 it was sold to John Shufelt with the rest of the campus, and in 2014 to Dennert O. and Suzanne Ware; it has been adapted as the Mission Point Resort.  Mission Point Resort (since 1987)  Major changes were made after the Mackinac Hotel and Conference Center was purchased by John Shufelt in 1987. The name was changed from The Mackinac Hotel and Conference Center to Mission Point Resort, a nod to the history of that area as home to Mission Church and Mission House. Mission Point Resort's vision was to create a welcoming, inspiring, and relaxing atmosphere for guests. Derelict buildings were converted into more functional and visually appealing spaces. The Howard Library was torn down to create the Front Lawn, which is now home to the gazebo and Mission Point's famous Adirondack lawn chairs. Many restaurants were added, including Chianti, Round Island Bar & Grill, and Bistro on the Greens. The Resort's theater has been renamed the Center for the Arts, which now hosts movie showings, art exhibits by local artists, and numerous craft workshops. This is in collaboration with the Mackinac Arts Council, Mackinac Island's non-profit arts agency. Mission Point is also a popular wedding and conference destination. It has ample meeting space in its Conference Center and several location options for wedding ceremonies and receptions. The resort is open from early May through the end of October and reopens for several days around New Year's Eve. Mission Point Resort was purchased in 2014 by Dennert O. and Suzanne Ware of San Antonio, Texas, who also own Silver Birches on Mackinac Island. The Wares are planning a multimillion-dollar property-wide upgrade over the next few years that will include an expanded spa and pool complex and guest room improvements.  1986 water treatment plant  The Mackinac Island Water Treatment Plant is located east of Mission Point and Robinson's Folly on the shoreline. It supplies potable water to nearly everyone on the Island. It is on former Mackinac Island State Park property deeded to the City of Mackinac Island, and was built in 1985/1986. This plant replaced the “Power House” pumping station north of the Arch Rock. The plant uses membrane microfiltration to filter water from Lake Huron and is rated at 2.7 million gallons per day.

The winner of the 2003 competition. Gustavus Adolphus pastry () is a pastry traditionally eaten every 6 November in Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus Day, the death day of King Gustavus Adolphus the Great. It is especially popular in Gothenburg, a city founded by the king. The pastry was created around 1900. Candy with the image of the king was sold by a konditorei in Gothenburg since the 1850s. The earliest mention of a pastry is from the Western parts of Sweden during the 1890s, where the pastry probably was created around the festivities when a statue of the king was erected in Gothenburg on a square, that since then is known as Gustaf Adolfs torg (\\"Gustavus Adolphus Square\\"). One Gothenburg bakery, Bräutigams, claims to have created it in the early 20th century, with the years 1905 or 1909 mentioned. Recipes for the pastry vary locally but most versions have a portrait of the king on the top, usually made of chocolate or marzipan. In 2003, a competition arranged by Livrustkammaren and Gastronomiska akademien (\\"Gastronomic Academy of Sweden\\") elected a winner without the king's portrait. The Swedish bakeries and konditoreis however preferred their old versions, so the attempt to establish a standard Gustavus Adolphus pastry failed. Exactly how many Gustav Adolphus pastries are sold in November each year is not known. The newspaper Göteborgs-Tidningen in 2009 approximated the total Swedish sales and consumption to more than 10 000. See also *List of pastries *Princess cake References ifood.tv.

It comprises equipment for loading and unloading of LNG cargo to/from ocean-going tankers, for transfer across the site, liquefication, re-gasification, processing, storage, pumping, compression, and metering of LNG.LNEG terminal project in Lithuania LNG as a liquid is the most efficient way to transport natural gas over long distances, usually by sea.  Types  Liquefied natural gas export terminal Liquefied natural gas terminals can be classed as: liquefication terminals for the export of LNGLiquefaction Export Terminals or regasification terminals for the import of LNG.Regasification of LNG: Strategic Access to Markets LNG terminals may combine both functions.  FSRU  Floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) A floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) is an LNG terminal whose main structure is a special ship moored near a port. As of January 2014 there are operating FSRUs in Brazil, Argentina, Kuwait, Israel, the UAE, Italy, Indonesia, China and Lithuania.World's LNG Liquefaction Plants and Regasification Terminals  Terminal processes and equipment = Unloading and loading of LNG  Terminal facilities include jetties and piers with articulated loading/unloading arms for transferring LNG between ship and shore. It also includes the piping used to transport LNG between the loading arms and the storage and processing facilities at the terminal. LNG is kept at about -162°C to maintain it in a liquid state. Conventional carbon steels are brittle at this temperature. Therefore special metals are used for this low-temperature cryogenic service where metal is in contact with LNG. Appropriate materials includes aluminium alloys with 3 to 5 percent magnesium and high nickel steels containing 9 per cent nickel. The loading/unloading arms and pipework are insulated to prevent heat gain from the air to minimise the vaporization of LNG. Tankers being loaded with LNG displace the vapour volume in their tanks, this gas is routed to boil-off or gas recovery storage tanks. Gas may then be compressed and fed into the local gas network, or it may be routed to the liquefication plant and returned as liquid to the LNG storage tanks.  Storage of LNG  The LNG flows through the pipelines that connect the loading arms on the jetty to storage tanks. Tanks are usually of double wall construction with the inner tank constructed of low-temperature alloy. This is surrounded by insulation to reduce heat gain and an outer tank of conventional steel or pre-stressed reinforced concrete. In-ground LNG tanks are also used; these are lined or unlined tanks beneath ground level. The low temperature of the LNG freezes the soil and provides effective containment. The tank is sealed with an aluminium alloy roof at ground level. Historically there have been problems with some unlined tanks with the escape of LNG into fissures, the gradual expansion of extent of the frozen ground, and ice heave which have limited the operational capability of in-ground tanks. All piping connected to the LNG tanks, whether above ground or in-ground, are routed through the top of the vessel. This mitigates against loss of containment in the event off a piping breach. Tanks may be situated within a bund wall to contain the LNG in the event of a rupture of the tank. This is usually a steel or concrete wall surrounding the tank to half the tank height. Heat transfer into the tanks causes vaporisation of the LNG. This boil-off gas is routed to a boil-off gas holder. Gas may be returned to an unloading ship to make up the vapor space volume. Alternatively it may be compressed and fed into the local gas network, or it may be routed to the liquefication plant and returned as liquid to the LNG storage tanks  Regasification  Regasification is the process of converting LNG from a liquid to a gaseous state. This requires significant quantities of heat energy to supply the enthalpy of vaporization of LNG and to heat it from -162°C to about 0 to 10°C for introduction into a pipeline. Gas may be sent to a main gas transmission system, which typically operates at 70–100 bar. NGL is first pumped as liquid to this pressure. A series of heat exchangers are used to regasify the LNG. These may include submerged combustion vaporisers, or an intermediate fluid exchanger (using propane or other fuids), or the use of waste heat from a nearby plant such as a power station. Final heating of the gas may use air or seawater heat exchangers. To meet the quality specification of the gas transmission system the outgoing gas may need to be analysed and enriched or diluted. Propane may be added to enrich the gas and nitrogen to ballast or dilute it. Prior to distribution into a high-pressure transmission system, the regasified natural gas is metered and dosed with a stenching or odorizing agent.  Liquefication  At times of low demand gas may be withdrawn from a transmission system and liquefied and stored. There are several proprietary systems that are used to liquefy natural gas and turn it into LNG. For full details of processes see liquefied natural gas.

Built in 1914 by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;), the depot served rail freight and passengers traveling in and out of the Greenback area until 1954. Restored for use as a community events center by Ronald Edmondson in the early 2010s, the depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013 in recognition of its role in the area's transportation history.Joel Davis, \\"Historic Greenback Depot Added to National Register,\\" Maryville-Alcoa Daily Times, 9 January 2014. Retrieved: 25 January 2014.Carolyn Melton Peck, \\"Depot Restoration and Activities,\\" Greenback Historical Society website, 2013. Retrieved: 25 January 2014. Design The depot is a one-story frame structure measuring by , and clad in weatherboard and bead board. It was a \\"combination depot,\\" meaning it housed both passengers and freight (stations for larger cities often had separate depots for passengers and freight). The southern half of the building's roof is hipped, and includes south-facing and west-facing dormers. Most of the windows are four-over-four double-hung sash windows with wooden frames, the exception being a clerestory window on the north wall. The depot retains its original wooden doors. Rolling track doors are located on the east side of the building. The depot's interior The depot's interior is mostly open space, the exception being an enclosed room in the building's southeast corner (once the \\"colored\\" waiting room). The northern half of the building, which was originally the freight area, is situated at a slightly higher elevation, accessible from the main area via steps. This higher elevation was necessary to bring the freight area to the same elevation as rail cars. The passenger area, in the southern half of the building, was originally divided into three sections: the colored waiting room in the southeast corner (still enclosed), the general waiting room in the southwest corner, and the ticket agent's office adjacent to the waiting rooms. A baggage area lay between the ticket office and the freight area. The interior has exposed rafters and pendant lights. The original slate roof was replaced with a metal roof in the 1980s, which was in turn replaced in 2012. The roof has been painted gray to match the color of the original roof. The railroad tracks passed along the western side of the depot. The tracks are no longer present, but the grade is still easily discernible as a gravel path all the way to the Meadow community several miles to the north. The tracks continued across Morganton Road before bending southeastward toward the Jena community (where the main tracks crossed what is now Highway 95). The L&N; operated a small freight yard opposite the depot between Morganton Road and Chilhowee Road, west of the Greenback Drug Store. The rail grade immediately west of the depot is included in the National Register nomination. A small addition to the northern end of the building, constructed in 2012, contains restrooms and a changing room. A breezeway separates this addition from the rest of the building. History The Greenback Depot, shortly after its completion in 1914 The Knoxville Southern Railroad (not to be confused with the larger Southern Railway) began building a rail line connecting Knoxville, Tennessee, with Blue Ridge, Georgia, in the late 1880s. This line reached what is now Greenback in 1890. At the rail line's intersection with Morganton Road, developers made plans to build a town known as \\"Allegheny,\\" presumably named after the Allegheny Springs resort further to the south. Lorenzo Thompson, who had established the Greenback Post Office several miles to the east in the early 1880s, moved his post office to the new town, and the town gradually adopted the name \\"Greenback.\\" In 1890, the Knoxville Southern merged with the Marietta and North Georgia Railroad. This railway was, in turn, absorbed by the Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern Railway in 1895. The Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern was purchased by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;) in 1902. For most of the latter half of the 19th century, the L&N; had avoided East Tennessee due to competition from the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad (ETV&G;), and in 1894 had made an agreement with the ETV&G;'s successor, the Southern Railway, not to encroach upon one another's territory. After the Southern violated this agreement, the L&N; began building a rail line connecting Cincinnati and Atlanta.Lucile Deaderick, ed., Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, TN: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 199-202. The L&N;'s new Cincinnati-Atlanta line continued southward from Knoxville through Maryville, Vonore, and Madisonville before reaching Etowah (the tracks along this line are still used by CSX). At Mentor (just north of modern Alcoa), a side route branched off from the main line, and looped around through Louisville, Friendsville, and Greenback, before rejoining the main line at Jena (a community once located where the tracks cross modern Highway 95). In the early 1900s, the L&N; constructed a number of elaborate depots along this line, including the Richard Monfort- designed L&N; Station in Knoxville and the Etowah Depot in Etowah. Construction of the Greenback Depot began in 1913, and was completed the following year. Map showing the L&N;'s tracks and stations in East Tennessee in 1913 William H. Jones, a Loudon County court clerk and local businessman, served as Greenback's station agent from 1910 until his death in 1954, including the entire period that the depot building was in use for its original purpose. Along with selling train tickets, Jones issued hunting, fishing and marriage licenses from his depot office. As a county official, he officiated at more than 3,500 marriage ceremonies, many of them in the depot. By the early 1950s, the L&N; had ceased passenger service at Greenback, and operated only two freight lines to the city. After Jones's death in 1954, the L&N; closed the depot. The Greenback Co-Op, a local farmers' cooperative, began leasing the depot from the L&N; in 1956 for fertilizer storage. To increase storage space, most of the interior walls were removed, the exception being the former colored waiting room, which was used as an office. After the L&N; merged with the Seaboard Coast Line in 1982, the new company sold the depot. Two local residents, Bobby and Linda Tarwater, operated an antique store in the depot from 1983 to 1984. After Bobby Tarwater's death, the depot was sold to Supra Sports, a local boat manufacturer, which used it for offices. Supra sold the depot to George Fowler in 1989, and Fowler sold it to Larry and Mary Alley in 1999. After searching for several years for a preservation-minded buyer, the Alleys sold the depot to Ron Edmondson in March 2012. Edmondson removed a false second story (which had been added by Supra for office space), replaced the roof, and painted the building in a manner that resembles its early 20th-century appearance. A wooden statue of the Cherokee leader Firekiller, carved by Townsend-based chainsaw artist Dave LaVoie, has been placed on the depot lot.

The squadron was disestablished on 1 February 1971, after eleven years of service. Operational history During its time, the squadron flew many different aircraft types, beginning in the years shown: Lockheed P-2 Neptune (1957); Douglas F3D Skyknight (1957); Grumman F-9 Cougar (1958); Douglas A-3 Skywarrior (1958, with several variants over the years); and Grumman A-6 Intruder (1966). The unit was established to train personnel for the heavy attack mission, including the pilots, bombardier/navigators and aircrewmen. It retained that mission throughout its life.

It was Jones' first fight in the light heavyweight division. Background As the current WBC light heavyweight champion Fabrice Tiozzo decided whether to remain a light heavyweight or move up to the cruiserweight division, the WBC organized a match for the interim WBC light heavyweight title between 39–year old number-one contender, Mike McCallum (whom Tiozzo had defeated for the title) and the reigning IBF super middleweight champion Roy Jones Jr., who was making his light heavyweight debut and was also regarded by The Ring as the number one pound-for-pound fighter in boxing. The future hall-of-famer McCallum was the underdog for one of the only times in his professional career and McCallum himself admitted that he \\"have to utilize everything I have if I'm going to win.\\"McCallum in for fight of his life vs. Jones, Las Vegas Sun article, 1996-11-14, Retrieved on 2014-02-03 Prior to the fight, controversy arose when the WBC and the Florida State Athletic Commission feuded over whose officials would judge the fight. Neither side budged and, ultimately, two sets of judge's, one from each organization, would score the fight. The official judges were from the FSAC, however the WBC judges would score the fight from the first row of the media section and WBC president José Sulaimán made it known that the organization would go by their judges scorecards, regardless if the FSAC judges ruled in favor of a different fighter then the WBC judges.Jones-McCallum \`Title' Bout Doesn't Help This Sport's Sorry Situation, Chicago Tribune article, 1996-11-24, Retrieved on 2014-02-03 The Fight Jones was not as aggressive as he had been in some of his past fights, choosing to fight McCallum cautiously for the most part. McCallum, though, had difficulty with the younger and quicker Jones and despite throwing 651 punches, 116 more than Jones, he connected with only 209 for a 32% success rate. Jones, meanwhile, landed nearly half of his thrown punches, connecting with 254 of 535 punches for a 47% success rate. Jones also scored the lone knockdown in the fight. Just before the end of the tenth round, Jones connected with a right to McCallum's jaw that put him down on the seat of his pants, however McCallum was able to quickly get back to his feet. The bout went the full 12 rounds and as a result went to the judge's scorecards. The official FSAC judges had Jones winning all 12 rounds and scored the bout 120–107. The WBC judges were also unanimously in favor of Jones, albeit with three diffent scores of 119–108, 117–110 and 116–111.Jones Jr. Wins W.B.C. Title, N.Y. Times article, 1996-11-23, Retrieved on 2014-02-01 Aftermath Shortly after his victory, Jones \\"interim\\" tag was removed and he was upgraded to full championship status as Tiozzo officially vacated his light heavyweight title and moved to the cruiserweight division. Jones' first light heavyweight title reign would not last long. In his next fight on March 21, 1997, Jones was disqualified after hitting his opponent Montell Griffin as he was down on one knee, becoming Jones' first loss as a professional. Jones, however, would knock out Griffin in a rematch later in the year and held the WBC light heavyweight title (eventually unifying it with the WBA and IBF versions along the way) until 2003 when he moved up to the heavyweight division. The bout would prove to be the final title fight of McCallum's career. After his loss to Jones, he would fight only one more time, losing by unanimous decision to James Toney in the third fight of their trilogy before announcing his retirement with a 49–5–1 record.

Life Pierre Trimouillat was born in Moulins, Allier, in 1858. He obtained a job as an official in the Prefecture of the Seine. He appeared at Le Chat Noir by 1891, an important step in gaining recognition in the Parisian cabaret scene. He contributed to the Chat Noir journal. He often attended the soirées of La Plume, the literary and artistic review set up in 1889 by Léon Deschamps. He published comic verses in this journal. Trimouillat proposed to the owner of the Procope to establish a cabaret on the first floor called Le Gringoire. Performers included Paul Delmet, Eugène Lemercier, Vincent Hyspa, Gabriel de Lautrec, Yan Nibor and Marcel Legay. A satirical paper, Le Gringoire, was based on these soirées and published between November 1893 and July 1894. The soirées at the Gringoire were soon replaced by soirées at the Procope that Trimouillat organized with Xavier Privas and Gaston Dumestre. In the 1890s Trimouillat belonged to the \\"Gardenia\\" dramatic circle that Paul Fabre had founded in 1887. For a long time he was one of the main performers at Le Chat Noir, where his thin voice would draw laughter from the audience. He also performed at many other venues including the Feuille de Vigne, Nouvelle Athènes, Paradis Latin, La Presse, Goguette, Quat'Z'arts, Procope, Caveau, Noctambules, Lice chansonnière, Bon Bock, Arts et Lettres, Caméléon, Chanson de Paris, Conservatoire de Montmartre, Chien Noir, cabaret de la Veine, Truie qui file, Carillon and Chat Botté. Plaque at 10, rue Chanoinesse An 1899 reviewer said of his work that his modernist poems included elements derived from the 17th century work of Molière. He had a mischievous and caustic wit. Starting in the early 1900s Trimouillat stopped performing apart from short appearances for charity. Trimouillat died in 1929. He lived at 10, rue Chanoinesse from 1890 to 1929.

The villages consisted of Ganneious, Kente, Kentsio, Ganaraske, Ganatsekwyagon, Teiaiagon, and Quinaouatoua. The villages were all abandoned by 1701.  Arrival  Iroquois Settlement on the north shore of Lake Ontario 1665–1701 The northern shores of Lake Ontario were first settled as early as eleven thousand years ago. While humans have lived along the northern shores of Lake Ontario for a long time, they have not been continuously settled. The Huron-Wendat had developed a distinct homeland along the northern shores of Lake Ontario in the 15th century, but moved north toward Georgian Bay by 1615, abandoning the northern shores of Lake Ontario. The Iroquois raided the Huron in Ontario during the first half of the 17th century and began to establish greater control over the hunting grounds that existed between Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe. By the 1640s the Huron-Wendat population had been reduced considerably by epidemics. In 1649, the Iroquois defeated the Huron, Petun, and then the Neutral, effectively destroying their enemies in Ontario. After the destruction of the Huron in southern Ontario the Iroquois began to make more frequent excursions on the northern shores of Lake Ontario. In the 1660s, the Iroquois began to expand their settlements north. A number of theories try to explain why the Iroquois began settling the northern shores of Lake Ontario. Economic reasons are considered the strongest motivation. By the 1640s the beaver had disappeared through over hunting in the traditional Iroquois homeland in modern-day New York state. The Iroquois were competing with both the Huron, Ottawa, and Algonquins for the fur trade. By establishing settlements on the northern shores of Lake Ontario the Iroquois were able to re-establish control on the flow of furs from the north and west towards Albany and Montreal. The Iroquois settlement into Ontario was part of a broader expansion of Iroquois groups in the mid 17th century. During this time the Iroquois also moved into what is today Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Quebec. Often these settlements were significantly closer to European settlements and have been characterized as Iroquois Colonies.  Description  The seven villages that were settled on the northern shores of Lake Ontario from east to west are: * Ganneious - on the site of present-day Napanee * Kente - on the Bay of Quinte * Kentsio - on Rice Lake * Ganaraske - on the site of present- day Port Hope * Ganatsekwyagon - at the mouth of the Rouge River * Teiaiagon - at the mouth of the Humber River * Quinaouatoua (or Tinawatawa) - Near modern- day Hamilton Little is known about the seven villages due to an absence of detailed archaeological evidence. The most comprehensive archaeological evidence gathered to date is from the Bead Hill archaeological site, which is believed to be the site of Ganatsekwyagon along the Rouge River. The villages do share some common traits that are evident from the available sources. The northern villages were likely seasons campsite prior to becoming larger settlements. They are located at strategic points controlling access to Lake Ontario and near seasonally abundant fish and games. Six of the seven villages are all located on the best agricultural land found along the northern shores of the lake, according to the Canada Land Inventory. The Iroquois likely grew squash, corn, and beans. The villages were also significant staging points for hunting parties moving north and for fur trading. The villages were the scene of extensive trade between both French, Dutch, English, and Ottawa traders and the Iroquois. The villages were also the site of violence due to the exchange of fur for liquor. There are number of incidents that record instances of maiming and death at Ganneious, Teiaiagon, and Ganatsekwyagon due to drinking. As in other Iroquois settlements longhouses were in parallel to each other and surrounded by palisades. The estimated size of the villages varies from 500 to 800 persons. The villages would have had 20 to 30 structures. Quinaouatoua, was perhaps the smallest with a population of less than 100 in the fall of 1669. The villages were settled by different tribes. The Seneca settled the westernmost villages of Quinaouatoua, Teiaiagon, and Ganatsekwyagon. The Cayuga settled Ganaraske, Kente, and Kentsio, and the Oneida settled Ganneious along the eastern edge of the lake. The villages were connected to each other by a system of trail and water routes. While each village is identified with one group, there is a strong likelihood that the villages continued a common Iroquois practice of incorporating and adopting large groups of outsiders into settlements. For example, a Neutral style longhouse was found at the Bead Hill archaeological site, which was initially settled by the Seneca. Existing texts also characterized populations in Iroquois communities distant from the homeland as being multinational and multilingual.  Relations with the French  In 1668, the French began to visit the Iroquois villages to convert the local population to Christianity. Abbé Trouvé and François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon were sent by François de Laval from Montreal to establish a Sulpician mission in the village of Kente. The mission was deserted in 1680 due to a lack of success and funding. Abbé Fénelon then went on a tour of other villages and would spend the winter of 1669 in the village of Ganatsekwyagon. François-Saturnin Lascaris d'Urfé visited a number of the towns on the North shore of Lake Ontario. French explorers Pere and Joliet also passed through the village of Ganatsekwyagon in 1669 on their way to Lake Superior. Relations between the Iroquois du Nord and the French were tense due to the intermediate conflicts known as the Beaver Wars. The villages were settled during a time of relative peace. In 1673 when the French established their first settlement along Lake Ontario, Fort Frontenac, in present-day Kingston, Ontario, many Iroquois from the nearby village of Ganneious resettled closer to the Fort. Relations deteriorated as the political situation in present-day New York state changed, and in 1687 the French attacked the Iroquois, destroying villages in both New York state and along the northern shores of Lake Ontario. The establishment of Fort Frontenac also appears to have shifted influence from Ganatsekwyagon to Teiaiagon. Most evidence indicates that Ganatsekwyagon was the more important settlement on the north shore due to its strategic position on the Rouge River arm of the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail. Following the construction of Fort Frontenac, Teiaiagon became more travelled for two reasons. First, the construction of the fort shifted the Iroquois toward the western route around Lake Ontario and second the French anchored at Teiaiagon instead of Ganatsekwyagon due to the superior anchorage for French trade barques.  Abandonment  In Anishinaabe oral tradition holds that the Iroquois abandoned their villages north of Lake Ontario following a number of decisive battles won by the Anishinaabe in south and central Ontario during the Beaver Wars. In the Great Peace of Montreal, signed in 1701, the Iroquois Confederacy agreed to remain on the south shore of Lake Ontario. By 1701 the Anishinaabe group called the Mississauga had moved into the area between Lake Erie and the Rouge River. The easternmost villages of Kente and Ganneious were reportedly destroyed in 1687 by Jacques Rene de Brisay de Denonville. His troops took 200 prisoners from both villages, to fight in the Beaver Wars, before destroying them. There are no accounts on the fate or condition of either Ganatsekwyagon or Teiaiagon after fighting broke out in 1687. It is assumed that, since both villages were no longer secure, they were abandoned some weeks earlier and the inhabitants fled to the south shore of Lake Ontario. Following the abandonment of the north of Lake Ontario by Iroquois some French geographers incorrectly place the Iroqouis du Nord and their villages on maps of southern Ontario as late as 1755. This would cause confusion among historians in the future when the Mississauga took possession of the northern shore of Lake Ontario.  Historical maps showing Iroquois settlement on the north shore  The following maps show evidence of the Iroquois settlements on the north shore of Lake Ontario. *Plans des forts faicts par le RegimentlCarignan salieres sur la Riviere de/Richelieu dicte autrement des Iroquois en/la Nouvelle France.

It is based on the Barry Allen incarnation of DC Comics character the Flash, a costumed superhero crime-fighter with the power to move at superhuman speeds. It is a spin-off from Arrow, existing in the same fictional universe known as Arrowverse. The series follows Barry Allen, portrayed by Grant Gustin, a crime scene investigator who gains super-human speed, which he uses to fight criminals, including others who have also gained superhuman abilities. Initially envisioned as a backdoor pilot, the positive reception Gustin received during two appearances as Barry on Arrow led to executives choosing to develop a full pilot to make use of a larger budget and help flesh out Barry's world in more detail. The series is primarily filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The Flash premiered in North America on October 7, 2014, where the pilot became the second-most watched premiere in the history of The CW, after The Vampire Diaries in 2009. It has been well received by critics and audiences, and won the People's Choice Award for \\"Favorite New TV Drama\\" in 2014. The series, together with Arrow, has spun characters out to their own show, Legends of Tomorrow, which premiered on January 21, 2016. On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a sixth season, which premiered on October 8, 2019. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a seventh season, which is set to premiere in January 2021. Series overview The first season follows crime-scene investigator Barry Allen who gains super- human speed after the explosion of the S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator which he uses to fight crime and hunt other metahumans in Central City as the Flash, a masked superhero. Barry pursues his mother's murderer, Eobard Thawne, eventually uncovering that his mentor Harrison Wells is Eobard in disguise. By the end of the season, Eobard's ancestor Eddie sacrifices himself to erase Eobard from existence but opens a singularity in the process. In the second season, the singularity brings speedster Zoom from a parallel universe, who seeks to eliminate all other speedsters in the multiverse. After Zoom kills Barry's father, Barry defeats Zoom and travels back in time to save his mother's life. In the third season, by changing his past, Barry creates the alternate timeline \\"Flashpoint\\". He is somewhat able to restore the timeline, but causes the emergence of Savitar, a god-like speedster with a grudge against Barry. When Barry accidentally travels to the future and sees Iris West killed by Savitar, he becomes desperate to change the future to prevent that from happening. After saving Iris and defeating Savitar, Barry takes his place in the Speed Force in order to repent for his creation of Flashpoint. The fourth season sees Team Flash successfully bring Barry back from the Speed Force, but in the process release dark matter, turning a dozen people on a city bus into metahumans, masterminded by Clifford DeVoe, an adversary with the fastest mind alive. After the defeat of DeVoe, the team is approached by Barry and Iris' daughter from the future, Nora West-Allen. During the fifth season, the team discover that Nora's presence has altered the timeline and unleashed Cicada, a serial killer bent on killing metahumans. They also eventually learn of her allegiance with Eobard, who orchestrated Nora's arrival and Cicada. Barry and Nora succeed in subduing Eobard, but are forced to let him go and Nora is erased from the timeline. In the sixth season, Barry and Iris learn that the date of the crisis in which Barry disappears has moved up to December 2019, and that in order to save billions, the Flash must die. Meanwhile, Ramsey Rosso has discovered a way to cure people through dark matter, only to turn himself into a metahuman with a violent bloodthirst. Following Rosso's defeat, Barry surviving Crisis, and the multiverse's destruction and rebirth, Team Flash try to navigate the world post-Crisis all while the secret organization Black Hole and quantum engineer Eva McCulloch, who is trapped in a dimension called the Mirror Dimension, move forward with their mysterious plans. Eva captures Iris and Kamila and later Captain Singh and imprisons them in her Mirror Dimension using their mirror versions to fight Team Flash.  Cast and characters  * Grant Gustin as Barry Allen / The Flash: A Central City assistant police forensic investigator. Moments after an explosion at the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator, Barry is struck by lightning in his laboratory and doused by chemicals affected by the accident. When he awakens from a nine-month coma, he has superhuman speed. In September 2013, Grant Gustin was cast in the titular role. Andy Mientus, who would eventually be cast as Hartley Rathaway, also auditioned for the role. Gustin began researching the character during the audition process, and reading as many comics as possible. Gustin primarily focused on The New 52 series of comics, because he knew it would be difficult to read everything and he felt the New 52 was the closest to the show's \\"look and feel\\". * Candice Patton as Iris West-Allen: The daughter of Joe West, sister to Wally West, and Barry Allen's wife, getting engaged in \\"Duet\\" and marrying during the Crisis on Earth-X event. She initially works at Central City Picture News as a journalist, and eventually establishes her own newspaper, The Central City Citizen.https://ew.com/recap/the-flash-season-5-episode-12/ * Danielle Panabaker as Caitlin Snow / Killer Frost: A highly intelligent bioengineering expert, Caitlin believed her fiancé, Ronnie Raymond, was killed during the particle accelerator explosion at S.T.A.R. Labs, until he returned part way through first season. Ronnie and Caitlin get married in the first season finale, \\"Fast Enough\\". She is also a metahuman with cryokinetic abilities. * Rick Cosnett as Eddie Thawne (season 1; guest seasons 2–3): A recent transfer to the Central City Police Department, Eddie's past was a mystery and he harbored a dark secret. He was partner to Detective Joe West and Iris West's love interest. Cosnett left the series after the first season, following his character's sacrifice to wipe Eobard Thawne, his distant descendant, from history. * Carlos Valdes as Cisco Ramon / Vibe: A mechanical engineering genius, Cisco is the youngest member of the team of scientists at S.T.A.R. Labs and is a former metahuman who had the power to “vibe” a person's location and was able to travel throughout the multiverse. * Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells: The mind and money behind S.T.A.R. Labs' Particle Accelerator, Wells becomes a pariah after his device implodes and creates a large number of metahumans in Central City. Wells mentors Barry, helping him to master his power and increase his speed. He is eventually revealed to be a time-traveling descendant of Eddie Thawne, named Eobard Thawne – the Reverse-Flash. Eobard, the Flash's archenemy from the future, murdered the real Wells and assumed his identity. In subsequent seasons, Cavanagh also portrays various doppelgängers of Wells from alternate realities. These characters include the sarcastic but brilliant \\"Harry\\", who, along with his daughter Jesse, hails from Earth-2; Wells' Earth-19 counterpart, the sci-fi novelist \\"H.R.\\", Earth-221's detective \\"Sherloque\\", and \\"man of adventure\\" Nash Wells. * Jesse L.

Martin took a medical leave of absence from the show during season five after suffering a back injury. * Keiynan Lonsdale as Wally West / Kid Flash (seasons 2–4; guest seasons 5–6): The son of Joe and brother of Iris, born without their knowledge after his mother left Central City. The producers disliked the introduction of relatives of characters that were never previously mentioned, feeling it was \\"weird\\", and opted instead to introduce Wally as unknown even to his relatives. They also chose to make him Iris' brother, a departure from the comics, where he was her nephew. Explaining Lonsdale's casting, Kreisberg said, “Just like when we met Grant [Gustin] for the first time, we instantly knew Keiynan embodied all the heart and courage of a hero.\\" After Flashpoint, Wally eventually gets speed powers from Doctor Alchemy and becomes Kid Flash. In season four, he leaves Central City to break out of Barry's shadow, and during that time he joins the Legends. He returns home briefly following the birth of half-sister Jenna West, and to confront Barry when problems with the Speed Force surface. * Neil Sandilands as Clifford DeVoe / The Thinker (season 4): A college professor and metahuman with a genius-level intellect, who looks to fix all that he deems wrong with humanity. * Hartley Sawyer as Ralph Dibny / Elongated Man (seasons 5–6; recurring season 4): A private investigator, formerly a corrupt CCPD cop, Dibny is a metahuman with superpowers including body elasticity and malleability.

Production=Development On July 30, 2013, it was announced that Arrow co-creators Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg, Arrow pilot director David Nutter, and DC Comics CCO Geoff Johns would develop a television series based on the Flash for The CW, and it would detail Barry Allen's origin. Kreisberg revealed after the announcement that Allen would first appear as a recurring character on Arrow in three episodes of season two—all written by Berlanti, Kreisberg and Johns—and the last of the episodes would act as a backdoor pilot for the new show. Kreisberg added that Allen would be a forensic scientist and the introduction of his superpowers, as well as the reactions to this, will be very human and grounded. Johns stated that the character of the Flash in the show would resemble his comic book counterpart, complete with his trademark red costume, and not be a poor imitation. Kreisberg elaborated: \\"No sweat suits or strange code names; he will be The Flash.\\" While researching the best way to depict the Flash's lightning speed, Johns stated it would not just be the standard \\"blurring around\\". Barry ultimately appeared twice in Arrow second season, with the planned backdoor pilot cancelled in favor of a traditional pilot by The CW executives, who had been impressed by early cuts of Barry's first two episodes on Arrow. This allowed the creative team to flesh out Barry's story and his world on a bigger budget, as opposed to a backdoor pilot's constraint of incorporating characters from the parent show. The pilot was officially ordered on January 29, 2014, and was written by Berlanti, Kreisberg, and Johns, and directed by Nutter. On May 8, 2014, The Flash was officially picked up as a series, with an initial order of 13 episodes. Three more scripts were ordered in September 2014 following a positive response to newly completed episodes by executives, while a back ten was ordered the next month for a full 23-episode season. With the commencement of production on the series' second season, former Arrow and Ugly Betty writer Gabrielle Stanton was promoted to executive producer and showrunner; after having served as consulting producer and writer on the first season's finale \\"Fast Enough\\". However, it was later reported that Kreisberg would be returning to sole showrunner duties at an unspecified time. That time was later proved to be at the start of 2016, \\"Potential Energy\\", when Stanton was no longer credited as being involved with the show. In May 2017, it was reported that Aaron Helbing would be departing the series. Helbing had served as a writer since the first season, and as co-showrunner, along with his brother Todd and Kreisberg, since the second. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a fifth season, which premiered on October 9, 2018. On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a sixth season, which premiered on October 8, 2019. On January 7, 2020, the series was renewed for a seventh season, which is set to premiere in January 2021. In April 2020, Gustin, who had been contracted for seven seasons, said there had been discussions about renewing the series for eighth and ninth seasons, but those were stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Design The costume was designed by Colleen Atwood, who also designed the costumes for Arrow. It features a burgundy color scheme, a masked helmet, and gold accents throughout,and went through multiple adjustments from the moment it was placed in computer renderings to the day of filming the pilot. Primarily made of leather, the suit contains areas with a stretchable material to allow Gustin room to bend. According to Atwood \\"It was all about a costume that could sell speed, Grant [Gustin] was continually moving in the suit, so it had to be designed to make that all happen visually and functionally.\\" It initially took Gustin approximately 40 minutes to get into his costume, as the first cowl was prosthetic and had to be zipped and glued to his face. This was cut down to approximately 15 minutes by episode eight, when designers were able to develop a new cowl that easily slid over Gustin's face and locked into place. Maya Mani replaced Atwood as the costume designer for the second season and made slight changes to the Flash costume, such as changing the color of his crest from yellow to white, being faithful to the Flash costume from the comics. Filming Production on the pilot began in March 2014, with filming taking place in Vancouver, British Columbia; additional filming for the series takes place in Portland, Oregon. On how action sequences are shot for the series, compared to Arrow, Gustin said, \\"When [Arrow] shoot[s] action sequences, pretty much what you see is what you get and they're really doing everything. We do a lot of plate shots that are empty shots of the area we're going to be in and then they're putting us in later in post. I do a lot of the fighting. I don't have to do it full speed and then they ramp it up and a lot of people have to freeze and I keep moving. Then I have to clear frame and step back into frame. It's really tedious stuff that we have to do. On theirs, they learn fight choreography and they shoot it from the perfect angles and what you see is what you get.\\" Production on the third season began in early July 2016. On March 13, 2020, production on the sixth season was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Season seven will begin filming on October 1, 2020 and is scheduled to conclude on May 19, 2021. Music Arrow composer Blake Neely is the primary composer of the series, and was first hired in April 2014 to score the pilot. He had previously composed a theme for Barry Allen which was featured in Arrows season two episodes \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Three Ghosts\\". The theme was titled \\"The Scientist\\" when it was released on the Arrow: Season 2 soundtrack. According to Neely, \\"It had to be different [from Arrow] ... but it also couldn't be so different that it couldn't fit in the Arrow universe, ... it had to be in a style that could hold hands with Arrow.\\" On December 18, 2014, WaterTower Music released a selection of music from The Flash/Arrow crossover episodes, as well as two bonus tracks from their respective 2014 midseason finales. The first season, two-disc soundtrack was released on October 16, 2015. The second season's soundtrack was released digitally on July 22, 2016, and in CD format on July 26, 2016. Sound design The sound design for the show is handled by Mark Camperell. The sound effect for Barry is made up of elements of thunder, electricity, jets, fireballs, and various custom whooshes and impacts. Speaking about designing the sound for The Flash's ability, Mark says: \\"My approach for the sounds of The Flash's ability was to editorially treat him like a really aggressively driven hot rod. This doesn't mean that I used car sounds for him, though. What I mean is that when thinking about how to edit his sounds, I thought about it like cutting a car chase.\\" Release=Broadcast The Flash was screened at the Warner Bros.

Labs to make Cisco create a weapon for her, as he did for Golden Glider, Captain Cold, and Heat Wave. When he does not cooperate, she shoots him.

Arrowverse and the DC multiverse In January 2015, The CW president Mark Pedowitz announced the intention to do a Flash/Arrow crossover every season, and The CW announced that an animated web-series, Vixen, featuring the DC heroine of the same name and set in the universe of Arrow and The Flash, would be debuting on CW Seed in late 2015. The character is expected to make a live-action appearance on Arrow and/or The Flash as well. The next month, it was reported that a spin-off series, which is described as a superhero team-up show, was in discussion by The CW for a possible 2015–16 midseason release. Berlanti and Kreisberg would executive produce alongside Guggenheim and Sarah Schechter. The potential series would be headlined by several recurring characters from both Arrow and The Flash, with the potential for other Arrow/Flash characters to cross over to the new series as well. In May 2015, The CW officially picked up the series, titled DC's Legends of Tomorrow. The second season begins to explore the concept of the multiverse, by introducing Earth-2, which features doppelgängers of the inhabitants of Earth-1 (the main setting of Arrow, The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow) along with Jay Garrick, the Flash of Earth-2, and Zoom. In the episode \\"Welcome to Earth-2\\", as Barry, Cisco and Harrison Wells of Earth-2 travel to Earth-2, glimpses of the multiverse are seen, including an image of Supergirl star Melissa Benoist as Supergirl and an image of John Wesley Shipp as the Flash from the 1990 television series, implying the two characters and their respective television series exist on alternate Earths to Earth-1; Supergirls world is later designated Earth-38 in the Arrowverse multiverse. Gustin as Barry appeared on the eighteenth episode of Supergirl, \\"Worlds Finest\\", which aired on CBS on March 28, 2016. Intersecting with the events of the eighteenth episode of The Flash, which aired on April 19, 2016, Barry accidentally arrives on Earth-38 and helps Kara battle two of her enemies, Silver Banshee (Italia Ricci) and Livewire (Brit Morgan), before returning home.

She found an escape through poetry as she would write and question her surroundings. Biography Mare became involved in the Hip hop music community and eventually became part of OCG crew as a rapper and singer. OCG eventually branched out and Advertencia Lirika was formed, the only female group of its kind in Oaxaca. In 2012, Mare teamed up with Simon Sedillo to create a documentary focusing on her musical career and aspirations as well as her life experiences and beliefs. Mare currently focuses on her solo career and continues singing and making music. Music Mare first became involved with hip hop in 2003, when she joined the group OCG. OCG branched out and some of its members decided to form collective project called Advertencia Lirika. This group formed in 2004, its members were Luna, Itza and Mare, they spread their music in local and national events. Advertencia Lirika is the first and only group of female rappers, in the state of Oaxaca, even until the present. In 2007 they released their first CD titled '3 Reinas' (3 Queens). They continued their collective work until 2009, when the group decided to break up and follow individual careers. Mare has since gone solo and focuses on her independent career though she remains committed to working in collectives and promoting the work and music of women. In 2010 she released her first EP as a soloist ‘Que mujer!’ a collection of seven songs about everyday life that focus on the injustices of her people and her gender. In 2010 she was involved in a compilation \\"Salir A Las Calles\\" with the purpose of disseminating the current situation of political prisoners in her country. Discography * 3 Reinas (2007) * Mujer de Maíz (2008) * Qué Mujer (2010) * Experimental Prole (2013) * SiempreViva (2016) Collective work Mare has been involved with various organizations. Mare incorporates her music into many of the projects she has been involved with. For example, her work with “Salir a las Calles” brings awareness to the political and social injustices in her country. She also spreads her message through songs like “Hasta Que el Último Salga,” in which she shows her contempt for prison injustices and land disputes. In 2009 she became part of the campaign \\"Justice for Oaxaca! Punishment of the Murderers of Lorenzo San Pablo Cervantes\\" which seeks justice for the death of Lorenzo Cervantez who was called by paramilitaries and white guards under the rule of Ulises Ruiz Ortiz. Cuando Una Mujer Avanza (Film) Cuando Una Mujer Avanza or “When a Woman Steps Forward” is one documentary film of a series produced by Manuvuelto, a community based media production whose efforts emphasize that of immigrant and indigenous communities. The documentary focuses on “Mare,” a young, indigenous, hip-hop artist from Oaxaca, Mexico. Throughout the documentary, Mare revisits her life as a native Zapotec woman and uses her unique experiences to share with others her perspective and insight on music, community, identity and gender. It is a portrait of her life, and by implication, it tells the story of many women in Oaxaca constricted by institutionalized sexism but discovering empowerment through hip-hop's global market for social justice. Mare embraces the world of hip hop and through her lyrics tries to empower and open the minds of people to strive for social justice. In 2012, after the completion of the film, she and its activist filmmaker, Simon Sedillo, toured the United States to promote the film.

Dating to the 6th Century AD, it was given to the British Museum by the Chinese Government in 1938.British Museum CollectionBritish Museum Highlights Discovery The inscription on the sculpture's base records that it was dedicated at the Chongguang temple in Hancui village in Hebei in the fifth year of Kaihung of the Sui dynasty, which equates to the year 585 AD. The village of Hancui can no longer be identified for certain, but it is understood to be located south-west of the city of Baoding in Hebei province, a region which in the past was known for its white marble. The statue was donated by the art dealer C.T. Loo to the Chinese Government, who in turn presented it in 1938 to the British Museum to commemorate the Chinese Exhibition, which took place in London between 1935 and 1936. Description At nearly 6 metres high, the Amitābha Buddha is the largest ancient Chinese statue in the West. Although largely intact, the now missing hands would have been fixed into the arm sockets by dowels. The right hand would have been raised in the gesture of fearlessness (abhayamudra), and the left hand lowered in the gesture of bestowal (varadamudra). The figure was carved in high relief to reveal garments with very flat folds, which was typical of figurative art in the Sui period. The whole statue stands on a massive lotus base with a dedicatory inscription in Chinese. Traces of red paint have also been found on the back. The Amitābha Buddha was originally flanked by a smaller standing bodhisattva that is now in the Tokyo National Museum. Buddhism in China In Buddhist doctrine, Amitābha rules over the Western Paradise, a serene and heavenly land where those who repeatedly chant his name can be reborn. Amitābha was very popular during the Sui dynasty (589-618 AD), when many buddhist images were created for pious devotees. This colossal marble figure is thought to be one such work and may have been modelled on Indian bronze statuary brought to China through the Silk Road.

The station currently carries a classic hits format covering Watseka along with Iroquois County and Kankakee with an output of 6000 watts ERP.WIQI Facility Record, fcc.gov. Accessed August 12, 2015 History From 2011 until March 2015, the radio station used the WKQX call letters while the 101.1 frequency in the Chicago market that is best known for those call letters was itself known as WIQI. Both stations were owned by companies associated with radio executive Randy Michaels, at the time, and Radioactive, LLC was using a common practice in the radio industry to hold call letters in one market solely in order to prevent their use by a competitor in another. During this period, the station itself broadcast for only days at a time in each late winter in order to prevent the license from being revoked by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for inactivity. The station's original 14 meter HAAT 1000 watt signal was limited to Watseka. On January 16, 2014, its call letters changed from WKQX to WIQI with the return of the WKQX calls to 101.1 in Chicago.Call Sign History, fcc.gov. Accessed August 12, 2015 In March 2015, the station asked for a construction permit to widen the signal's coverage, mainly towards the Kankakee area; this was granted on April 15. On June 23, 2015, WIQI placed this facility on the air; at that time, it began to broadcast full-time with daytime airstaff. This came shortly before the FCC began to disallow the abuse of license holding to keep a station silent on July 2, 2015.

It functions the same as a regular IRA, only instead of holding paper assets, it holds physical bullion coins or bars. Precious metals IRAs are usually self-directed IRAs, a type of IRA where the custodian allows more diverse investments to be held in the account. The four precious metals allowed to be held in an individual retirement account are gold, silver, platinum and palladium, provided they are in the form of IRS- approved coin or bar products. Since gold is the most commonly purchased of the four, the overarching term \\"gold IRA\\" is used most often as industry slang to mean a retirement account containing any combination of precious metals. Other terms such as, \\"precious metals IRA\\", \\"silver IRA\\", \\"platinum IRA\\", or \\"palladium IRA\\" are also frequently used. Investors often use precious metals as a long-term hedge against inflation, to diversify their portfolio. Internal Revenue Code requirements state that the approved precious metals must be stored in a specific manner. Some trustees have their own facilities to hold the physical precious metals, while others use a third party metals depository as a storage facility. History The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 broadened the permissible types of investments allowed in IRAs, stating: \\"Your IRA can invest in one, one-half, one-quarter, or one-tenth ounce U.S. gold coins, or one-ounce silver coins minted by the Treasury Department. Beginning in 1998, your IRA can invest in certain platinum coins and certain gold, silver, palladium, and platinum bullion.\\" IRA-accepted precious metals The IRS approves select precious metals and forms of bullion for IRAs. Although investment in \\"Collectibles\\" using IRAs and Qualified Plans is not allowed,IRC §408(m)(1) - https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/408 there is a carve- out allowing for investment in certain coins, as well as bullion meeting certain fineness requirements.IRC §408(m)(3) - https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/408 There are more advantages to holding gold coins as opposed to bars in a gold IRA in terms of liquidation. Gold bars are more difficult to sell due to their higher price and easier ability to be counterfeited, as well as being more difficult to deliver due to their heaviness and the amount of security required during transport. There are currently a variety of precious metals that meet the minimum purity requirements that are acceptable for inclusion into a gold IRA account. Some gold IRA companies argue inclusion of certain coins in a precious metals IRA; however, several of those companies have been investigated by the government for misleading customers and aggressively selling numismatic coins over gold bullion. Numismatic coins pay the gold company higher commissions, but bullion bars more directly reflect the spot price of the precious metal.

The account holder may liquidate their IRA metals for cash or take physical possession of them. Both actions are akin to taking an IRA distribution and will be taxed accordingly. Storage To comply with IRS requirements, all IRAs, including precious metals IRAs, must be in the possession of a trustee or custodian, not the owner's individual possession. IRS Publication 590 specifies that for all IRAs, \\"The trustee or custodian must be a bank, a federally insured credit union, a savings and loan association, or an entity approved by the IRS to act as trustee or custodian.\\" Many trustees/custodians use civilian (private) depositories, which may be approved by various commodities exchanges, for storing IRA metals. Security features may include timed locks and automatic re-locking features, 24/7 monitoring, and motion, sound, and vibration detectors. They typically have large insurance policies, with some amounting to as much as $1 billion. A depository may hold the metal assets as a single fund shared among the investors, or track each investor's assets separately. All nonbank IRA trustees must demonstrate to the IRS that they will meet Treasury standards of accounting, auditing, reporting, and asset security. With such stringent custody requirements, an investor has little chance of successfully acting as trustee for their own gold IRA. Neither the IRS nor federal courts have recognized any \\"self-storage\\" arrangement for keeping gold IRA assets in the investor's home or a safe deposit box. The IRS has warned that such unconventional arrangements carry a risk of disqualifying the IRA.

It was part of the second generation of VA hospitals in the U.S., which were built from 1920 to 1950. The Marion VA Hospital is the only VA hospital built during this period which was designed in the Egyptian Revival style, which was chosen to recognize the region's nickname of \\"Little Egypt\\"; elements of the style used in the building include its pyramidal roof, projecting pavilion, and smooth outer walls with multicolored ornamentation. The hospital was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 9, 2013, as the Marion Veterans Administration Hospital Historic District.

His father was the painter Franz Lefler. Life and work From 1880 to 1884, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under Christian Griepenkerl and, from 1884, at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich under Nikolaus Gysis and Wilhelm von Diez. In 1891, he became a member of the Society of Austrian Artists and, in 1900, was a founding member of the Hagenbund. From 1900 to 1903, he was an assistant to Anton Brioschi, the head designer at the Vienna State Opera, following which he became a professor at the Academy until 1910. While at the Vienna Opera, he designed a set for the Metropolitan Opera and shipped the pieces to New York. Besides the time spent in his formal occupations, he spent a great deal of time in Weißenbach an der Triesting with his father and his brother-in-law, Joseph Urban, a fellow scenic designer, where they painted murals on villas and hotels, designed invitation cards for summer festivals and, with librettist Camillo Walzel, staged theatrical productions for children. The team of Lefler and Urban created many public events as well, including the 1905 Schiller Festival parade and a procession along the Ringstraße in 1908, on the occasion of the Emperor's 60th Jubilee. Lefler also designed banknotes, financial warrants and promotional posters for several companies, including Auerlicht and Krupp. Many of Lefler's costumes and stage designs have been preserved in the Max Reinhardt Collection at Harvard.Max Reinhardt Collection of Viennese Costume and Design In 1903, he married opera singer Mina Wiesmüller, who modeled the portrait that appears in his design for the 1000 Kronen banknote.

Parks' work is displayed at such places as the Black Ensemble Theater Company in Chicago, IL, Buddha Sky Garden in Delray Beach, FL, and the Beverly Hills home of Saudi royalty.  Career  After graduating high school in Augusta, Maine in 2003, Parks found a local glass artist giving lessons and he took a class. It was during that single class that Parks discovered his passion for glass and knew that's what he wanted his career to be. He soon signed up for more classes at Snow Farm, a craft school, in western Massachusetts. After taking several classes he decided to set up his own studio in Whitefield, Maine in 2004. While beginning his own business in his studio, Parks furthered his glass education taking several courses throughout the United States. In 2004-2005, he studied at The Studio of The Corning Museum of Glass with some the best glassblowers in the world, including Italian glass maestros Elio Quarisa and Cesare Toffolo, William Gudenrath, and Jesse Kohl. He also studied with Jay Musler at Penland School of Crafts, and Sally Prach at Pilchuck Glass School. Parks' work has always been inspired by nature. In the early days, Parks focused on making intricate wine goblets with sea creatures, flowers and animals. From there he went on to create vases, perfume bottles, and marbles, many of which had frogs, flowers, and sea life. Soon Parks shifted his focus to a much larger scale. While art had always been Parks' main focus, he wanted to take his work a step further by combining art with functionality. A couple of years after moving his studio to the Los Angeles area, Parks began designing and creating hand blown glass chandeliers, pendants, wall sconces and sculptures. With chandelier names like Anemone and Bella Fiore, Parks has stayed true to his nature themes.

There is also a hidden sandbar that is located about one hundred feet from the shore where it seems you may easily swim out to this sandbar and stand in approximately three feet of water. You may be tempted to swim out to this sandbar if you see experienced local people swimming out to it. The local swimmers that swim out may be wearing scuba flippers on their feet which may give them enough control to swim in the strong water. However, the water is deep before you reach the sandbar, and the shape of the beach, and the sandbar seems to cause a very strong and dangerous riptide that sweeps from right to left, and even an expert or advanced intermediate swimmer may be quickly swept onto the rocks, or out to sea. This risk can not be underestimated in the winter. There are no signs or warnings of any kind on the beach, so exercise extreme caution as this is a very serious and unseen danger.

Stippled area is top of the Pacific Rim Terrane. Also shown: Cape Flattery, San Juan Island, and the cities of Port Renfrew, Sooke, Port Angeles, Port Townsend, and Victoria. The northeast extension of the San Juan fault may be an older feature.. Newer studies show the Leech River fault more closely aligned with the SWIF.. The Leech River Fault extends across the southern tip of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, creating the distinctively straight, narrow, and steep-sided valley, occupied by Loss Creek and two reservoirs, that runs from Sombrio Point (southeast of Port Renfrew) due east to the Leech River, and then turns southeast to run past Victoria. It is a thrust fault that marks the northernmost exposure of the Crescent terrane (part of Siletzia), where basalt of the Metchosin Igneous Complex (correlative with the Crescent Formation on the Olympic Peninsula) is dragged under Vancouver Island by the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate. About ten kilometers north the nearly parallel San Juan Fault marks the southern limit of rock of the Wrangellia terrane, which underlies most of Vancouver Island. Between these two northeast-dipping thrust faults are the Leech River Complex and (near Port Renfrew, but also outcrops near Victoria) the Pandora Peak Unit.The principal authority for the Leech River Fault is , summarized in . These, along with the Pacific Rim Complex further up the coast,Exposed between Tofino and Barkley Sound. are remnants of the Pacific Rim terrane which was crushed between Wrangellia and Siletzia.. The contact between the bottom of Wrangellia and the top of the subducted PRT continues northwest along the coast as the West Coast Fault, and southeast towards Victoria as the Survey Mountain Fault. The Leach River Fault (LRF) extends off-shore towards Cape Flattery, where the Crescent—Pacific Rim contact continues northwest as the Tofino Fault (TF).. The bottom contact of the Crescent Terrane has been uplifted and exposed along the edge of the Olympic Peninsula, where it is known as the Hurricane Ridge Fault (HRF). West of Cape Flattery the southernmost edge of the Crescent Terrane appears to be an extension of the LRF, suggesting left-lateral strike- slip along the Leech River Fault that has offset the Crescent Terrane nearly its whole width.. The Leech River Fault (LRF) is a key element in understanding regional tectonic history as it and the San Juan Fault mark a change from the relatively simply subduction zone structure to the northwest, to the complex structures of the San Juan Islands and the Puget Lowland to the east and southeast. The straightness of its surface trace suggests the LRF has been a strike-slip fault.; . In these respects the LRF is very similar to the Devils Mountain Fault, which can be traced due west from near Mount Vernon to a point just south of Victoria.. Near the Leech River, where the Survey Mountain fault marks the eastern limit of the Leech River Complex,. the LRF and the lineament it follows make a sharp turn to the south (heading S70°E) to run down the Goldstream River, past Victoria and into the Juan de Fuca Strait.. Such sharp turns are geometrically impossible for individual strike- slip faults, but the southeast-striking Goldstream arm of the LRF parallels the cross-cutting Survey Mountain fault. Strong aeromagnetic anomalies in the Strait that curve from Victoria to Discovery Bay (west of Port Townsend) led to early speculation that the LRF, and the eastern limit of the Crescent Formation, ran down Discovery Bay and the west side of Puget Sound, following the edge of a relict continental margin just as the Tofino Fault follows the present margin.;. This alignment through Discovery Bay is what calls the \\"Cenozoic truncation scar\\". More recent interpretations of marine seismic reflection studies align the Goldstream arm of the LRF with the Southern Whidbey Island Fault (SWIF), with splays branching towards Discovery Bay.. Discovery of Crescent Formation basalt in an exploration well on Whidbey Island (just east of Port Townsend) has led some writers to locate this extension of the LRF onto the southern part of Whidbey Island, just where the SWIF is found.. While the eastern contact of the Crescent Formation is believed to not extend east Whidbey Island, and may double-back westward under Seattle,. active faulting on the SWIF extends southeast to where it connects with the Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone. Thus it appears that the Leech River and Devils Mountain faults were once a single left-lateral oblique fault (having both horizontal strike-slip and vertical dip-slip motion) that has been offset by right-lateral motion along the extended Survey Mountain—Southern Whidbey Island Fault. The earlier history of the LRF is revealed by certain metamorphic rocks of the Pacific Rim terrane with a very distinctive mix of minerals.Particularly, prehnite coexisting with lawsonite or aragonite. . These are also found in the San Juan Islands and in isolated outcrops spread across the Cascades. They formed between 100 and 84 Ma (millions of years ago) during the Late Cretaceous when the Pacific Rim terrane was crushed between Wrangellia and the North American continent, dismembered, and the pieces smeared along what was then the edge of the continent.; . Continued right-lateral transpression carried outlying portions of Wrangellia and likely some odd pieces of the Pacific Rim terrane northwest to Gulf of Alaska.; . Note that the ancient continental margin was not along the modern coast line (that runs due south from Vancouver Island), but turned in at the modern day Juan de Fuca Strait and followed the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL) towards southern Idaho,; . paralleling the general trend of faulting in British Columbia and the North Cascades. The Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL) marks the approximate continental margin in the Late Cretaceous. The northeastward impact of part of Siletzia formed an embayment as indicated by the Darrington-Devils Mountain fault and the mélanges originally in front of the continental margin. About 50 million years ago the Siletzia terrane, being borne to the northeast by the subducting plate, refused to be subducted. It ran it into the edge of the continent and embayed the overlying crust, bending the section of the Wrangellia—Pacific Rim contact now known as the San Juan fault to its current easterly orientation. This also initiated the oblique left-lateral Devils Mountain fault, including the section now known as the Leech River fault, and its right-lateral extension, the Darrington fault, that strikes southward from the town of Darrington to converge with the right-lateral strike-slip Straight Creek Fault at the OWL (see map).If connected strike-slip faults having opposite senses of movement seems strange, consider the Crescent terrane (the part of Siletzia relevant here) as a very blunt arrowhead: the point is now near Darrington (unlabelled black square on map); the Devils Mountain and Darrington faults are the opposite sides of the arrow head. Arrayed with them in an arc are the various mélanges (metamorphosed subduction zone sediments) originally aligned along the OWL. About 42 million years ago this northeastward force rotated to a northerly direction which, striking the SWIF more obliquely, caused the strike-slip movement that offset the LRF past Victoria. It was previously believed that apparently undisturbed glacial deposits lying across the fault showed it had been inactive since the last glaciation,. and that displacements on the Devils Mountain fault were accommodated through other faults in the San Juan Islands.. However, a 2017 study reported that the Leech River fault has experienced at least two, and possibly more, large, surface-rupturing earthquakes since the last ice age,. and that earthquakes on these faults should be expected as a result of displacements on other faults such as the DDMF and SWIF..

H. Auden. Thought to have been written in 1948, the poem gleefully describes in graphic detail a homosexual encounter involving an act of fellatio. Poem The syncopated poem runs to 34 stanzas of four lines, with an ABAB rhyming scheme. The meter is borrowed from Charles Williams's mystical Arthurian poem Taliessin through Logres. Auden mixes demotic argot with formal expression, using clever internal and external rhymes and half-rhymes. The first verse starts: It was a spring day, a day for a lay when the air Smelled like a locker-room, a day to blow or get blown. History Auden described writing a \\"purely pornographic\\" poem in a letter to Chester Kallman in December 1948, as an addition to the \\"Auden Corpus\\". Auden jokingly suggesting that Kallman write a similar poem about \\"the other Major Act\\" (anal sex) to be published together on \\"rubber paper for dirty old millionaires\\" with illustrations by Paul Cadmus. He also wrote the poem to demonstrate his true nature to Professor Norman Holmes Pearson, with whom Auden was collaborating on a poetry anthology. Copies were circulated to Auden's friends but it remained unpublished until 1965, when Ed Sanders obtained a copy from an employee of the Morgan Library and published it (without Auden's permission) in his New York counterculture magazine Fuck You / A Magazine of the Arts (Vol 5 No 8) in March 1965, with a cover by Andy Warhol. The poem was included without a title, described as \\"a gobble poem snatched from the notebooks of WH Auden\\". A brief publication history of \\"The Platonic Blow\\" appears in Bloomfield and Mendelsohn's 1972 bibliography of Auden's work (University of Virginia Press, Charlottesville, VA, p 366 ff.) Auden admitted his authorship to friends, and in print in the Daily Telegraph Magazine in 1968.Daily Telegraph Magazine issue 201, page 22; August 9, 1968 It was published by the European magazine Suck in October 1969, again without permission, under the title \\"The Gobble Poem\\" and then by Avante Garde magazine in 1970 entitled \\"A Day for a Lay\\". However, by 1970, Auden was denying authorship, and returned the royalty cheque. A separate edition of the poem, followed by a scabrous haiku (\\"My Epitaph\\"), has been available since 1985 from Orchises Press in Alexandria, Virginia. The sensual description of a homosexual sex act has been compared to the long 1970s poem \\"Ode\\" by Mutsuo Takahashi.

The amino-acid sequence of CSP consists of an immunodominant central repeat region flanked by conserved motifs at the N- and C- termini that are implicated in protein processing as the parasite travels from the mosquito to the mammalian vector. The structure and function of CSP is highly conserved across the various strains of malaria that infect humans, non-human primates and rodents. It can first be detected in large quantities as sporozoites are forming within oocysts residing in the midgut walls of infected mosquitoes. Upon egression from mature oocysts, sporozoites begin migrating to the salivary glands, and CSP is known to be an important mediator of this process. Additionally, CSP is involved in hepatocyte binding in the mammalian host. Here, the N-terminus and central repeat region initially facilitate parasite binding. On the hepatocyte surface proteolytic cleavage at region 1 of the N-terminus exposes the adhesive domain of the C-terminus, thereby priming the parasites for invasion of the liver. CSP is an approximately 42 kD soluble protein and can readily be made using an E. coli expression system.

Founded in 1923, they were productive during the late Taishō period (1912–26). Mavo re-instituted the Japanese Association of Futurist Artists, the anarchistic artist group who displayed an outdoor exhibit in Ueno Park in Tokyo in protest of conservatism in the Japanese art world. The group leader was Tomoyoshi Murayama (1901–1977). The group deployed an interdisciplinary array of performance art, painting, illustration and architecture, to communicate anti-establishment messages to the mainstream. Fueled by responses to industrial development, the Mavo group created works about crisis, peril and uncertainty. Art Historian, Gennifer Weisenfeld has written that Mavo sought to reintegrate art into daily life. “Mavoist” artists sought to disrupt or blur the boundaries between art and daily life. They rebelled against the establishment by combining industrial products with painting or printmaking, usually in collage form. Their performance art protests against social injustice deployed theatrical eroticism, that mocked public norms for morality at the time. During a 1923 demonstration, Takamizawa Michinao, one of the members of Mavo, threw rocks in protest, through a glass ceiling of a building housing an exhibition of artworks curated by Nika-kai (The Second Society). Nika-kai was established in 1914 to oppose the conservative Bunten, the governmental Ministry of Education Exhibition. Murayama had spent 1922 in Berlin where he became familiar with the social satire painting of Georg Grosz, Wassily Kandinsky's \\"spiritual\\" abstract paintings, El Lissitzky's constructivist works, and Alexander Archipenko's sculptures. As a cultural leader and public figure, Murayama had a confident, flamboyant personality, an androgynous physical presence sporting a bob-hairstyle, and posing for photographs in states of undress. Associated artists Mavo Magazine #4 Other artists involved in the movement include Tatsuo Okada, Masao Kato, Masamu Yanase, Kamenosuke Ogata, Shuzo Oura and Shinro Kadowaki, and later Osamu Shibuya, Shuichiro Kinoshita, Iwane Sumiya, Michinao Takamizawa, Kimimaro Yabashi, Tatsuo Todai, and Kyojiro Hagiwara, among others. Magazine Tatsuo Okada and Tomoyoshi Murayama edited MAVO magazine, that published seven issues between July 1924 and August 1925. The publication included essays on socio-cultural art, poetry, and theatrical texts. The pages included original linocut prints and photographic reproductions of visual art that often appropriated the work of their own members. Reuse and recycling from one project to another was one of the group's trademark strategies. Originally, Mavo Magazine came with a firecracker adhered to its cover. Artists' books Several members of the group produced short-run artist's books including Hagiwara Kyojiro's Shikei senkoku (Death Sentence), an anthology of visual poetry published in 1925, and illustrated by Mavo; Ernst Toller's Tsubame no sho, (The Swallow Book) illustrated by Tatsuo Okada and translated by Tomoyoshi Murayama (1925); and Hideo Saito's Aozameta douteikyo, (The Pale-faced Virgin's Mad Thoughts) visual poetry published in 1926 and illustrated by Tatsuo Okada.

During his military service in the Korean War, he became the first arranger for the United States Army Chorus. He ended his teaching career as Professor Emeritus at the Mary Pappert School of Music, Duquesne University, where he had been a professor since 1961, and composed over 200 works.  Early life and military service  By the age of six, Jenkins had already begun piano lessons; soon afterward, he started composing small pieces in elementary school. In high school, he wrote numerous arrangements as well as some original works for orchestra. In 1946, Jenkins began his tertiary studies at Saint Joseph's University (then St. Joseph's College) in Philadelphia, where he focused on pre-law with the ambition of becoming a lawyer. At the same time, he studied composition and counterpoint with Vincent Persichetti at the Philadelphia Conservatory (which became part of the University of the Arts in 1962). Jenkins completed his degree at St. Joseph's in three years and enrolled in the Eastman School of Music in 1949. While there, he studied under important composers including Thomas Canning, Howard Barlow, Bernard Rogers, and Howard Hanson. Jenkins graduated from Eastman with a Masters of Music in 1951, in the middle of the Korean War. He was subsequently drafted into the Army and assigned to serve at Fort George G. Meade, in Maryland. During his military service, Jenkins was the arranger for The United States Army Field Band as well as for the Armed Forces Radio Network. While with the Army Field Band, he composed his now famous American Overture for Band, Op. 13. A 50th anniversary version of American Overture for Band was published by Theodore Presser Company in 2004, with collaboration between Jenkins and the publisher. The original score was updated to include revisions to the work's dynamics, articulations and pitches. American Overture became Jenkins' most successful work and he stated he would be \\"hard-pressed to duplicate its success.\\"  Teaching career and reenlistment  In 1953, Jenkins held an interim teaching position at Catholic University, replacing a professor on sabbatical. He was so impressed by the faculty and courses at Catholic that he decided to take advantage of G.I. Bill funding and complete his doctorate there, studying under William L. Graves and other scholars. While there, Jenkins also studied under Conrad Bernier, who Jenkins would later list in an autobiographical book chapter under individuals who were especially influential in his development and career. In 1956, Jenkins reenlisted in the military to become chief arranger and assistant conductor of the United States Army Chorus, formed that same year, becoming the institution's first arranger. Established as the vocal counterpart to the Army Band, the Army Chorus is a premier male vocal ensemble. Jenkins wrote over 270 arrangements for voice while with the Army Chorus, in addition to several original works. Jenkins is known for his vocal arrangements of well-known Stephen Foster works, such as \\"Beautiful Dreamer,\\" \\"Camptown Races,\\" \\"Oh! Susanna,\\" and \\"Some Folks,\\" which he wrote for the Army Chorus and remain part of its core repertoire, along with many of his other arrangements. Jenkins began his position as a tenured Professor of Theory and Composition at the Mary Pappert School of Music, Duquesne University in 1961. At Duquesne, he taught music theory, orchestration and composition and \\"was beloved by his students, colleagues and fellow musicians.\\" During his term at Duquesne, Jenkins served as Head of the Theory and Composition Department in the university's School of Music. Pittsburgh Historic Landmark. Much of his collected choral works are available as part of Gumberg Library's Music Library Resources, alongside those of jazz guitarist and educator Joe \\"Handyman\\" Negri, another music educator who also influenced youth (in Mister Rogers' Neighborhood) and mature minds as a professor at Duquesne. LTC John Clanton, former director of the U.S. Army Orchestra and U.S. Army Chorus, stated that Jenkins is \\"one of only a handful of composers and arrangers in the entire world who truly understands the musical potential of the male chorus\\". In addition to his university teaching, Jenkins influenced students at the primary and secondary school levels as the organist and instrumental music teacher (orchestra director) at St. Edmund's Academy, and by composing works for the orchestra at The Ellis School, both in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He composed works for other elementary and secondary schools, including the Holy Innocents High School of Pittsburgh and the Marlborough School of Los Angeles. Apart from his influence in classrooms, Jenkins participated as organist and choirmaster at Sewickley Presbyterian Church in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, at St. Bernard Catholic Church in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and at Rodef Shalom Congregation in Pittsburgh.

She was later renamed, Pender Queen then Pender Lady. Motor Princess was built in 97 days at by Yarrows Ltd. in Esquimalt. She was built for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's B.C. Coast Service. Motor Princess had a main car deck as well as space for cars on the front half of the upper deck, connected to the main car deck with a ramp. She was a wooden-hulled vessel and the first diesel powered vessel in CP's fleet. She had a cruising speed of 14.5 knots. (Turner, 129) Robert Turner describes the passenger amenities in his book, \\"The Pacific Princesses\\": Naturally, emphasis was on automobile facilities, but passengers were far from neglected. Though her lounge space was limited compared to the spacious equivalent quarters on the larger ships in the [CP] fleet, the Motor Princess was nonetheless well appointed. On both sides of the upper car deck, carpeted lounges were provided with large windows for viewing the scenic Gulf Islands. In addition, the after two-fifths of the upper deck were devoted to a combination dining room and social hall with hardwood flooring. Two staterooms were also provided on the compact ship, and ample open deck space was available for leisurely strolls and relaxing in the sun during the summer months. (129) Turner cites the construction of the Motor Princess as being a turning point in ship construction for CP. From then on, almost all new ships would be more friendly towards transporting cars. (Turner, 129) Service When first built, Motor Princess was placed on the Bellingham - Sidney route. She remained on this run for 3 years. (Kline and Bayless, 95 ; Turner, 129) CP moved Motor Princess north to operate between Vancouver and Nanaimo, in 1926. In 1929, she was placed on a route between Steveston (south of Vancouver) and Sidney (near Victoria). In 1950, the CP was forced to remove Motor Princess from passenger service due to changed federal regulations regarding wooden vessels. For the next 5 years, she was used to carry freight between Vancouver and Victoria. (Turner, 193) Motor Princess was sold to the Gulf Islands Ferry Company in 1955 who removed the wooden superstructure and replaced it with a steel one. The new ferry bore no resemblance to the old wooden freighter/ferry, she now had an open car deck and just a small upper deck for passengers/crew. She was then put into service in the Gulf Islands. (Turner, 193) In 1961, Motor Princess joined B.C. Ferries with the rest of the Gulf Island Ferry Company fleet. BC Ferries bought the company's ferries and terminals on 1 September 1961 for $249,823 and renamed her Pender Queen in 1963. BC Ferries continued to operate Pender Queen in the Gulf Islands. (Griffiths and Cadieux, 42) One event in the life of Pender Queen with B.C. Ferries was recorded by Garth Griffiths and Capt. H.L. Cadieux in their book, Dogwood Fleet. They relate a story of Pender Queen losing engine power one night near North Pender Island. She was barely rescued from going aground by Queen of Saanich under the command of Captain Amodeo. (Griffiths and Cadieux, 97) Pender Queen was retired from service in 1980 and sold a year later for $75,300. According to Gary and Patricia Bannerman, it was sold to a Saltspring Island company. (Bannerman, 170) In June 2003 the vessel sunk in Naden Harbour on the north end of the Queen Charlotte Islands and later scrapped.

Early life and education The youngest of four children, Holtz was born and spent his early childhood in Skierniewice, Poland, a small town near Warsaw. His father was a hat maker and a furrier. In 1935, prior to World War II, when Holtz was ten years old, his family moved to Jerusalem, Israel, where they settled in the Geula neighborhood near Meah Shearim.Chana Ya'ar, “High-End Hassidic Art Gallery Opens in Brooklyn,” Arutz Sheva, May 17, 2012.Sergey Kadinsky, “Elderly Artist, environmentalist, young families fly with Nefesh B’Nefesh,” The Jewish Star, June 23, 2010. Itzhak Holtz's passion for art began early. When he was five years old, in Poland, his father first drew a picture of a horse and sled in the snow for him. The young Holtz looked at the drawing and studied it in wonderment. From that moment on, Holtz remembers, he constantly begged his father to draw for him. His enthusiasm for art grew and Holtz longed to study art. In 1945, he enrolled at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, where he primarily studied lettering and poster work in a program geared toward commercial art.“Brooklyn, NY – Crown Heights Welcomes Opening Of Hasidic Fine Art Gallery,” Vos Iz Neias?, May 21, 2012. Holtz became interested in painting, prompting him to move to New York City in 1950Nathan Ziprin, “An Artist In Israel,” Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle, January 12, 1968, p. 6. to study at the Art Students League of New York under Robert Brackman and Harry Sternberg, and then at the National Academy of Design under Robert Philipp.Richard McBee, “Itshak Holtz: Jewish Genre Painting,” The Jewish Press, July 4, 2003. Art career and work Holtz has stated that his artwork, which primarily but not exclusively depicts scenes of Jewish spirituality and tradition, is driven by his Orthodox Jewish beliefs. He said, \\"You have to live that religious life to fully capture it on canvas.\\" He has been classified in the school of genre painting, often depicting street scenes of ordinary people in everyday Jewish life in the back alleys and markets of Jerusalem neighborhoods such as Me'ah Shearim and Geula;“Itshak Holtz,” Alexander Gallery. Retrieved February 4, 2014. and in New York neighborhoods and hamlets such as Monsey, Boro Park and Williamsburg. Along with street scenes, his work includes portraits of scribes, tailors, cobblers and fishmongers, and images such as shtetls, lighthouses, and wedding scenes.Stephen Nessen, “Brooklyn’s Hasidic Art Scene Expands with New Gallery,” WNYC, May 17, 2012. He started out painting mostly portraits in order to support his family, before expanding to include street scenes. His beloved subject matter is painting scenes of Jewish life, his childhood memories when his mother took him shopping for the Sabbath to the markets of Meah Shearim, left a deep impression on him and influenced many of his works. Holtz has experimented in the abstract, but then reverted to representational and figurative art to which he devoted himself exclusively. His Israeli street scenes are said to combine \\"an affectionate recollection of the past with the brilliance of the color of modern Israel.\\" Holtz has stated that he struggled at first when he arrived to the United States because of financial reasons and because he only knew Polish, Yiddish and Hebrew, but then made good ties with his instructor who greatly influenced him Robert Philipp who helped him make friends and referred him to paint portraits. Examples of Holtz's work throughout the years include: Yerusalem Wedding (2010), depicting a Chuppa in Jerusalem on early evening, oil on canvas; The Funeral(1966), depicting five stoic Hasidim carrying a body on a bier over to a gravesite, with the people behind them crying, in charcoal on paper and oil on canvas; Rejoicing (1974), an image of religious men dancing, in felt pen and marker on paper; and the oil painting Shamash Learning in Shul (2003), a portrait of a pious Jew studying the Talmud inside a claustrophobic synagogue scene. Throughout the years Holtz has created hundreds of works in many art mediums, including, genre scenes, portraits, still lifes and landscape scenery, his works are sought after by art collectors worldwide, and he has been called the greatest living Jewish artist.\\"Artist Bios,\\" Belmont Galleries. Accessed May 14, 2014. It is said that no artist ever explored the Jewish subject like Holtz. Today some of his oil paintings have been commanding over $100,000. Style and technique Itshak Holtz Signature Holtz creates his scenes after researching locations, and often uses locals as models. He paints slowly and with great care, but with a swift Impressionistic style. The people in his portraits and scenes are generally more cheerful and optimistic than standard portraits of Hassidic individuals. He paints oils and watercolors, and also does felt pen, pastel, marker, ink and charcoal drawings, as well as woodcuts.Sonja Sharp, “Crown Heights Welcomes Opening of First Hasidic Art Gallery,” DNAinfo New York, May 17, 2012. His oil paintings typically have a brown hue, while his work with felt pen is often in sepia tones, and on some of his works he used very bright colors, with a strong emphasis on the interplay of light and shadow. He is heavily influenced by the ancient staircases and alleyways of Jerusalem, with its modest religious population, which has made a strong impression on him in his youth, the streets of Tzfat, and the works of Rembrandt, Johannes Vermeer and Peter Bruegel, as well as Jewish artists Moritz Daniel Oppenheim, Leonid Pasternak and Isidor Kaufmann have had a strong influence on him. He has said that realism is the best way he can express himself. Exhibitions Some of Holtz's past exhibitions include: * A 1967 exhibit at the Theodor Herzl Institute in New York featured approximately 30 of his oil paintings.Art Exhibition of Oil Paintings by Itshak J. Holtz: December 3-24, 1967, Theodor Herzl Institute, 1967. * From October 1992 through July 1993, many of his Jewish genre paintings were exhibited at the Yeshiva University Museum in New York, in a show titled The World of Itshak Holtz.Itshak Jack Holtz, The World of Itshak Holtz: A Twentieth Century Genre Painter: October, 1992 – July, 1993, New York: Yeshiva University, 1992. * In 2012, the first exhibit at the Betzalel Gallery in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, was the month-long Itshak Holtz: A Personal Vision – Drawings and Watercolors, displaying his felt pen and marker drawings and watercolors from 1963 to 1999.

Influence and legacy Holtz is fascinated by the glamorous and the unglamorous, his genre art explores the strange beauty in simplicity and even in the deserted. He tends to reveal by his paintings things people don't appreciate in their everyday city lives. His nature landscapes and scenery are in an impressionistic style with an emphasis on light. Holtz's Jewish art represents and reveals the contemporary Jewish life with an important link to its past. For over half a century of painting the subject matter he cherishes, he reveals in his Judaic art the modesty, spirit and simplicity of the religious life that so intrigued him on the Jerusalem streets since his childhood. He paints tradition, rituals, festivals, community and character. His art of Jewish subjects has influenced many younger Jewish artists like Eli Frucht and David SegalDavid Segal: Fine Art Judaica/Portraiture . Accessed May 14, 2014. to follow and explore this Jewish genre. Personal life Following his graduation from the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Holtz married Ruth Beck in 1951. They have two children, Arie and Aliza. For much of their time together, their primary residence was in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood. Starting in the late 1960s, they maintained homes in both New York and Jerusalem.

The Prussians tried to surround their outnumbered adversaries but most of the French evaded capture. Nevertheless, Möllendorf's troops inflicted casualties on the French in the ratio of nine-to-one and occupied Kaiserslautern. While the Prussians won this triumph on an unimportant front, the French armies soon began winning decisive victories in Belgium and the Netherlands. The battle occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1794 Kaiserslautern was part of the Electoral Palatinate but today the city is located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany about west of Mannheim. In December 1793, the French drove the soldiers of Habsburg Austria and Prussia from French soil in the Second Battle of Wissembourg and took positions beyond the eastern frontier. That spring the Army of the Moselle sent heavy reinforcements to northeast France, leaving the Rhine front lightly defended by troops under Jean René Moreaux. Taking advantage of French weakness, the main Prussian assault was aimed at Ambert who could only try to save as many of his troops as possible. Also on 23 May an Austro-Prussian army attacked the Army of the Rhine under Claude Ignace François Michaud but was repulsed at the Battle of Schifferstadt. After losing Kaiserslautern, the two French armies withdrew to positions closer to the frontier. Having expended almost the only initiative they displayed in 1794, the Prussians allowed their offensive to sputter to a halt. Background On 26 December 1793, Lazare Hoche, in overall command of his own Army of the Moselle and Jean-Charles Pichegru's Army of the Rhine defeated the Coalition army of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser in the Second Battle of Wissembourg. Though part of the Prussian army of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel intervened late in the day, it could only keep the French from launching a close pursuit. Three days later, Wurmser's army crossed to the east bank of the Rhine River at Philippsburg. The two French armies pressed north along the west bank of the Rhine and relieved the siege of Landau. Brunswick's Prussians withdrew all the way to Worms and Oppenheim.Phipps (2011), pp. 110–111 Jean-Baptiste Jourdan While the right wing of the Army of the Moselle advanced to Speyer, the left wing under Jean René Moreaux occupied Kaiserslautern on 1 January 1794. The French pursued as far north as Bad Kreuznach before encountering Prussian resistance and falling back to Kaiserslautern. On 18 January the Coalition garrison withdrew from Fort-Louis and blew up the fortifications.Phipps (2011), pp. 112–114 On 14 January Pichegru was relieved in command of the Army of the Rhine by Claude Ignace François Michaud. This ended the constant bickering that had sprung up between him and Hoche.Phipps (2011), p. 119 The Prussians were not fully committed to the war because their leaders were divided over whether it was more important to crush the French Revolution or participate in the Third Partition of Poland. As it was, Prussia wished to leave the Coalition at the end of 1793, but kept fighting in 1794 when the United Kingdom paid to keep 60,000 of its troops in the field. Fed up with interference from King Frederick William II, who was more interested in Poland, Brunswick resigned command of the army. Lazare Hoche On 19 February 1794, the Army of the Moselle under Hoche counted the divisions of Jean Étienne Championnet, Claude François Desbureaux, Jacques Maurice Hatry, François Joseph Lefebvre, Moreaux, Antoine Morlot and Nicolas Augustin Paillard. The army numbered 76,489 but there were only 47,665 effectives.Phipps (2011), p. 116 Orders from the government arrived to advance on Trier which Hoche objected to because the army lacked boots and many other supplies. The advance started anyway but it was quickly called off and the army took up winter quarters along the Blies and Saar Rivers. By this time Committee of Public Safety had come to mistrust Hoche as too successful and therefore a threat. Hoche was put under arrest and remained in prison until the Thermidorian Reaction when Maximilien Robespierre and his associates were sent to the guillotine. On 10 March 1794 Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was ordered to assume command of the Army of the Moselle.Phipps (2011), pp. 120–125 On 15 March, Jourdan ordered the army's left wing to advance to Arlon while giving Moreaux command of the army's right wing. Setting up his headquarters at Blieskastel, Moreaux moved his divisions forward with his right flank in Kaiserslautern. Meanwhile, the army's left wing occupied Arlon on 15 April.Phipps (2011), p. 127 At first the 21,788-man left wing was under the command of Hatry. On 2 May, Jourdan personally took command of the army's left wing and reinforced it so that it numbered 56,014 troops, although there were only 31,548 effectives. The left wing included the divisions of Championnet, Hatry, Lefebvre and Morlot. These headed north with Jourdan and left the eastern theater altogether. Though Jourdan nominally led the army until 25 June, for all practical purposes the Army of the Moselle (that is, the right wing) was under the command of Moreaux from 2 May.Phipps (2011), pp. 147–148 Moreaux received some reinforcements taken from the Army of the Rhine so that he had 25,000 soldiers in three divisions thinly deployed between Longwy on the west and Kaiserslautern on the east. Meanwhile, the Army of the Rhine under Claude Ignace François Michaud counted 38,500 men, but only 30,000 were able to take the field. These were spread out along the Speyerbach River between Speyer and Neustadt an der Weinstrasse, with Louis Desaix's division on the right by the Rhine. Moreaux's positions were vulnerable to attack from Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf's Prussian army to his front and the Austrians in Trier and Luxembourg City on his left. Michaud's army faced the Prussian left wing under Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen and the Habsburg Austrians led by Friedrich Wilhelm, Fürst zu Hohenlohe- Kirchberg.Phipps (2011), pp. 128–129 Combat of Kaiserslautern Wichard von Möllendorf. Though aware of the weakness of his defense lines, Moreaux did not want to retreat, possibly because he was masking Jourdan's transfer of troops to the north. Kaiserslautern was held by the division of Jean-Jacques Ambert with eight battalions, a cavalry regiment and two squadrons of chasseurs à cheval. Many of the soldiers were raw recruits and some were not even armed. One of the few veteran battalions was commanded by Nicolas Oudinot. Anxious about the position, Moreaux sent Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr, an adjutant general whose advice he trusted, to look over the ground. Saint-Cyr advised Ambert to retreat but that general had orders to hold his ground though he had only 5,000 troops. Meanwhile, Möllendorf chose to make his main effort against Kaiserslautern.Phipps (2011), pp. 130–131 Jean-Jacques Ambert Möllendorf massed 46,000 Prussian and Electoral Saxon troops in 43 battalions, four companies, 42 squadrons and 10 1/2 batteries. The divisions were commanded by Friedrich Adolf, Count von Kalckreuth, Alexander von Knobelsdorff, Franz Kasimir von Kleist, Friedrich Gisbert Wilhelm von Romberg, Ernst von Rüchel, and Duke Louis of Württemberg. Kalckreuth's Prussian units included the Infantry Regiments Crousaz Nr. 39 (two battalions), Hertzberg Nr. 47 (grenadier battalion) and Borch Nr. 39 (three battalions) and three squadrons of the Bayreuth Dragoon Regiment Nr. 5. Kalckreuth's Saxon contingent was made up of one battalion each of Infantry Regiments Langenau, Lindt, Prinz Max and Prinz Xaver, four squadrons each of the Kurfürst Cuirassier and Albrecht Chevau-léger Regiments and two squadrons of the Hussar Regiment. Kalckreuth led one Saxon howitzer battery and two foot and 1/2 horse artillery batteries of Prussians. The remaining divisions were composed entirely of Prussian troops and invariably counted three infantry battalions in each infantry regiment.Smith (1998), p. 81. The listed units total 42 battalions, 38 squadrons, five companies plus an unknown number of squadrons in Romberg's division. Knobelsdorf's division comprised the Infantry Regiments Thadden Nr. 3, Kalckstein Nr. 5 and Kleist Nr. 12, the Thadden Fusilier Battalion Nr. 13, two squadrons of the Eben Hussar Regiment Nr. 2, one Jäger company and one foot artillery battery. Kleist's division was made up of the Infantry Regiments Knobelsdorff Nr. 27 and Prinz Ferdinand Nr. 34, two squadrons of the Voss Dragoon Regiment Nr. 11 and one foot artillery battery. Romberg's division consisted of the Infantry Regiments Brunswick Nr. 21, Prinz Heinrich Nr. 35 and Köthen Nr. 48, the Eben Hussars, one Jäger company and one foot artillery battery. Rüchel's division had the Infantry Regiments Rüchel Nr. 30 and Wolframsdorff Nr. 37, the Ernest Fusilier Battalion Nr. 19, three squadrons each of the Eben Hussars and Voss Dragoons, three Jäger companies and one horse and two foot artillery batteries. Württemberg's cavalry division included five squadrons each of the Leib Cuirassier Nr. 3, Borstell Cuirassier Nr. 7 and Lottum Dragoon Nr. 1 Regiments and one foot artillery battery. On 23 May, Ambert and Saint-Cyr heard the sound of gunfire and rode out to investigate. They discovered that the Army of the Rhine was under assault to the east. Saint-Cyr convinced Ambert that it was time to withdraw, since it was likely that their own lines would soon be attacked in force. Before anything more could be done, the Prussian attack materialized. Saint-Cyr successfully managed the retreat of the forward elements behind the Lauter River. Then Ambert determined to retreat in two columns, personally taking the left column while Saint-Cyr led the right column. Möllendorf planned to envelop and capture Ambert's division entirely, sending out Kleist's division to head off the French retreat. A flying column under Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher was sent to cut the link between the two French armies but this effort failed. The French were favored by the terrain in which the roads to the rear went through narrow passages, difficult for a pursuer to follow. Saint-Cyr put his cavalry and artillery in the middle of his leading unit and was able to avoid pursuit. His column arrived at Trippstadt as the town was being attacked by Kleist. This lucky accident allowed Saint-Cyr's column to easily brush off Kleist's division and escape. Ambert's column had more trouble. His infantry was supposed to hold the edge of a forest until the cavalry and artillery of the rear guard reached it. By some error, the foot soldiers continued on their march. The Prussian horsemen routed their adversaries and the defeated French cavalry stampeded through the ranks of their own infantry, causing chaos. Oudinot's battalion, made of sterner stuff, chased off the Prussian cavalry and returned to the edge of the woods where they recovered some of the abandoned artillery. However, they were unable to drag away the guns because the horse teams had been killed. Continuing the withdrawal, Oudinot's men encountered a Prussian roadblock, but forced their way through. The two retreating columns reassembled at Pirmasens except for some soldiers who fled as far as Bitche. At Kaiserslautern the French lost about 1,000 men killed, wounded or missing in addition to 17 artillery pieces and two colors. Total Prussian casualties were 110 while Saxon losses were unknown but very light. Combat of Schifferstadt Meanwhile, the Coalition attack along the Rhine was repulsed by the divisions of Desaix and Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino. At Schifferstadt the French lost 500 killed and wounded out of 20,000 men engaged while the Coalition suffered 900 casualties out of 30,000. The Austrian forces engaged were the grenadiers of Infantry Regiments Reisky Nr. 13, Wilhelm Schröder Nr. 26, Strassoldo Nr. 27 and Olivier Wallis Nr. 29. The Bavarians involved in the clash were two battalions of the Combined Infantry Regiment and four squadrons of the Combined Chevau-léger Regiment.Smith (1998), p. 80 Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen's Prussian infantry included three battalions each of Infantry Regiments Manstein Nr. 9, Romberg Nr. 10 and Hohenlohe Nr. 32, two battalions each of Infantry Regiments Schladen Nr. 41 and Kunitzky Nr. 42, Fusilier Battalions Renouard Nr. 2 and Martini Nr. 10 and two Jäger companies. The cavalry consisted of five squadrons each of Cuirassier Regiments Saxe- Weimar Nr. 6 and Leib-Carabinier Nr. 11, Dragoon Regiments Schmettau Nr. 2 and Katte Nr. 4 and Hussar Regiment Goltz Nr. 8 plus 10 squadrons of Hussar Regiment Wolfradt Nr. 6. There were five foot and two horse artillery batteries. Results Laurent Saint-Cyr After the loss of Kaiserslautern, the Army of the Moselle withdrew to the Saar while the Army of the Rhine retreated behind the Queich River to Landau. Möllendorf would have done better by following Jourdan to the north. His minor victory at Kaiserslautern was greatly overmatched by Jourdan's decisive triumph at the Battle of Fleurus.Phipps (2011), p. 132 Möllendorf's offensive quickly ground to a halt and the Prussians set about building a series of armed camps to hold their newly captured territory. The next action in the theater occurred on 13-17 July in the Battle of Trippstadt. At the end of this battle on 17 July, the French occupied Kaiserslautern and moved forward to the Speyerbach again, wiping out all of the Coalition's recent gains.Phipps (2011), p. 134 Moreaux recognized the conduct of Saint-Cyr and Oudinot in his order of the day. On 10 June National Convention deputy Nicolas Hentz insisted that Saint-Cyr be elevated to general of brigade since he already commanded a brigade. When Saint-Cyr objected, the politician compelled him to accept the promotion by threatening to put him under police observation. Within a few days Hentz again promoted him to general of division. Saint-Cyr gave the excuse that another general with the same family name, Louis-Jean-Baptiste Gouvion was in disgrace and that suspicion would fall on himself. Hentz overrode this objection saying, \\"Is it only that? Can a brave man like you be hindered from serving the Republic well because there is a rascal in his family? You shall be general of division. I will it!\\" Saint-Cyr's fears were well-founded. In 1793, the revolutionaries executed 17 generals and in 1794 the number rose to 67.Rothenberg (1980), p. 36 Saint-Cyr was assigned command of the 2nd Division of the Army of the Rhine while Oudinot received the rank of general of brigade in the Army of the Moselle.

Established as an Attack Squadron designated VA-127 on 15 June 1962 at NAS Lemoore, California, it was redesignated VFA-127 on 1 March 1987 and disestablished on 23 March 1996. Operational history TA-4Js and Singapore Air Defense Command A-4S's in 1974 F-5Ns and F/A-18s at NAS Fallon, Nevada in 1993 Prior to being established as VA-127, the unit operated as VA-126 Detachment Alfa with a mission to provide basic and refresher all-weather jet instrument and transition training for pilots on the West Coast. Upon being redesignated VA-127, its primary mission became to provide advanced all-weather jet instrument training for fleet replacement pilots and refresher training for light jet attack pilots. A secondary mission included jet transition and refresher training. On 1 Jun 1970, the squadron’s mission was modified when it was designated as the only A-4 Replacement Air Wing squadron in the Navy. The primary mission included fleet replacement pilot training, basic and refresher all weather jet instrument training and replacement enlisted training in both the TA-4 and A-4 model aircraft, plus the ancillary mission of providing jet transition training. The flight syllabus included weapons delivery (conventional and nuclear), airborne electronic countermeasures, field mirror landing practice, low level navigation, inflight aerial refueling, defensive tactics and carrier qualifications (day and night). In 1971, the squadron expanded its training on the A-4 to include personnel from the Argentine Navy; previously it had trained only U.S. naval aviators. That same year, it also began training pilots of the Singapore Air Defense Command. In 1975, the squadron’s primary mission changed once again. Fleet Replacement Pilot training and the Fleet Replacement Aviation Maintenance Program were discontinued. The squadron’s new missions included basic refresher all weather jet instrument training, air combat maneuvering adversary training, foreign pilot training, and jet transition/refresher training. In November 1975, CNO officially tasked VA-127 with the mission of air combat maneuvering (ACM) adversary training. On 1 Oct 1983, The squadron’s instrument training mission was dropped and the primary mission became the Adversary Role (Dissimilar Air Combat Maneuvering).

The port is one of three ocean ports in the country and handles over 90% of the country's cargo traffic. According to the International Association of Ports and Harbors, it is the fourth largest port on the African continent's Indian Ocean coastline after Durban, Mombasa and Maputo. The port acts as a gateway for commerce and trade for Tanzania and numerous bordering landlocked states. For years the inefficiencies at the port has cost the regional economy millions of dollars; in 2012 the total global welfare loss caused by the inefficiencies of the port stood at US$1.8 billion for the Tanzanian economy and 830 million US dollars for the neighbouring countries. History=Colonial period Image of the Port of Dar es Salaam from the book Von Unseren Kolonien by Ottomar Beta in the year 1908 The Port of Dar es Salaam Lighthouse in south east of Kivukoni The city of Dar es Salaam owes its existence to the port of Dar es salaam. The city began development in 1862 by the Sultan of Zanzibar Seyyid Majjid as an alternative port to the port of bagamoyo and zanzibar, however after his death the project was scrapped. It wasn't until the German East African Company began to rebuild the city in 1887. The Germans had already completed the Usambara railway from the Port of Tanga and began constructing the new Tanzanian Central Line from their new capital the port of Dar es Salaam. After World War I the British took over Tanganyika and maintained their capital in city. Economic activity continued through the early 20th century and through World War II centralized around the city and facilitated expansion of the port. After Tanganyika gained its independence the city retained its position as the commercial capital. Apartheid South Africa Due to the Apartheid South Africa government many land locked South African countries such as Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi that relied on South African ports turned to the Port of Dar es salaam. This facilitated the construction of the TAZARA Railway, TANZAM highway and the Malawi corridor link. The port provides a gateway for Zambian copper exports and Malawian tobacco exports, furthermore it provides a vital lifeline for fuel imports. Present operations An aerial view of The Dar es Salaam Port during the day time. With the continually growing economies in the region the reliance of dar port increased drastically. The port saw an average of 10% annual growth of cargo traffic from 2003 onwards which complemented the rapid growth of the city of Dar es Salaam. Challenges facing the Port of Dar es Salaam 05 July 2018 The port has faced increased criticism of inefficiencies and corruption and has seen increased international pressure. = _Reasons for constructive criticism_ = 1\\\\. Geography The port provides an economic backbone for 4 of the 5 land locked countries that border Tanzania. 2\\\\. Rise in costs The inefficiencies has increased the cost of business in the region and has given the government a chance to implement various expansions and outsourcing projects for the day-to-day running of the port. =Outcomes of successful mitigation of constructive criticism= This will showcase the government as an excellent care taker of the port for the last fifty seven years. Expansion The port is currently being expanded at the cost of $421m. The number of vehicles will rise by 268 percent upon completion of the port. In July 2020, a foundation stone was laid for the construction of an inland Port in Tanzania at the cost of $20m. The construction will include building a 150m berth, which is all set for completion in 24 months. As of July 2020, 80 percent of the construction has been completed. Foreign cargo centers A cargo crane at the Tanzania Ports Authority. 35% of cargo moving through the port is foreign owned and Dar es-Salaam port facilitates countries that rely heavily on Dar es salaam port and gives them licenses to operate their own cargo centers. The foreign cargo centers help countries to process cargo from their respective countries to increase efficiency and reduce costs. MOFED Tanzania Limited MOFED Tanzania limited is a Zambian Owned clearing and forwarding company. MOFED stands for the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development which in April 2001 replaced the defunct zamcargo. The company is an entirely Zambian government owned organization and deals with the majority of Zambian Exports and Imports. MOFED operates out of the Mukuba Depot, located in south Kurasini and has direct access to the TAZARA rail link. Malawi Cargo Center Limited The Malawi Cargo Center was set up by the Government of Malawi in the early 1990s due to the closure of Beria and Nacala ports following the Mozambique Civil war. The company has dedicated warehouses and operates dry ports in Dar es-Salaam and Mbeya. The MCCL's main revenue earner/cargo is fuel bound for Malawi. Fuel and goods are loaded onto wagons on the TAZARA bound for Mbeya and then trucked into Malawi through the Kyela Border.

Early life The son of Sir Frederick W. Bowater, KBE, and Dame Alice Bowater, he was educated at Charterhouse School in Godalming, Surrey. He then served with the Royal Artillery from 1913. Badly wounded at the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917, and decorated Legion of Honour, he was subsequently pensioned off from the British Army. Career After a period of convalescence, he joined the family business of W.V. Bowater and Sons in 1919, taking charge of project management for construction of the company's first paper mill at Northfleet on the south side of the Thames estuary near Gravesend, Kent. After ensuring that the mill reached full production in 1925, he joined the company board and became Chief Executive in 1927. Expanding the firm quickly, he sold part of the business to Lord Rothermere, using the funds to double production at Northfleet. He then reached agreement with both Lord Rothermere and Lord Beaverbrook to invest directly in the build of a new paper mill at Ellesmere Port on the River Mersey close to Liverpool, with the mill's profits ensured through long-term supply agreements with his investors. However, the 1930s recession brought about a need by the investors for cash injections into their own business, resulting by the early 1930s in the company again being wholly family owned. Bowater then oversaw an international expansion of the business, with offices and mills in Canada, the United States and Australia. Seconded to the Ministry of Aircraft Production by his friend Lord Beaverbrook, he was made a Director-General and placed in charge of the salvage of all downed aircraft. Bowater was subsequently knighted in 1944 for his services to the war effort. Returning to the family business in 1945, he oversaw its development into six lines of business, and its resultant expansion into the world's leading supplier of paper products, with total assets of £194,891,000 and annual sales of 2,422,000 long tons of paper, pulp and other products valued at £150,818,000. However, at the time of his death in 1962, the business was in a period of consolidation, brought on by over expansion and excessive debt. Company assets in 1962 totalled close to £200 million.Robert Knight, ‘Bowater, Sir Eric Vansittart (1895–1962)’, rev. Anita McConnell, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 Aug 2014 He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Personal life He married Blanche Murre de Ville, with whom he had one daughter. After divorce, he then married Margaret Vivian Perkins on 23 June 1937, with whom he remained married until his death in 1962, and with whom he had a daughter and a son. His main home was Dene Place in West Horsley, Surrey (now converted into a Bupa nursing home), which on top of its extensive ornamental gardens, then housed a dairy farm based around a herd of pedigree Guernsey cattle. He also owned extensive lands in Newfoundland, Canada, including: a house, Strawberry Hill in Corner Brook; a fishing lodge on the Serpentine River; and a farm on the banks of the Humber River, where he raised Ayrshire cattle. He also had homes in Riceville, Tennessee, and Australia, where he entertained friends who included HM Queen Elizabeth II. He died at his home in Surrey on 30 August 1962, survived by his wife, son and two daughters.

It stars Gustavo Bermúdez and Ana María Orozco. Plot The main characters are Joaquín (Gustavo Bermúdez), a famous businessman, owner of a motorcycle manufacturing plant, and Manuela (Ana María Orozco), his maid. After the death of his friend Sergio Miranda and his wife in an airplane crash, Joaquín became the legal guardian of Miranda's four orphans. One of these orphans is Pilar Miranda, who is really the daughter of Manuela. Manuela had gotten pregnant at the age of 15 and had to give up her newborn daughter for adoption; years later, she became a journalist and began searching for her child. Upon discovering that Pilar had been adopted by the Mirandas, she took a job as a maid in their home. Upon the Mirandas' deaths, she came along with the children to work for Joaquín. To avoid revealing her true identity, she works under the assumed name of \\"Ramona\\". Premise Somos familia is a traditional telenovela aimed at all age groups. The plot has similarities with Grande, pá!, one of Telefe's successful telenovelas of the 1990s. Bermúdez plays a traditional telenovela gentleman, seducing the female spectators with romance rather than physical appearance. Although the program is mainly a drama, it includes some comedy scenes, most of them played by actor Fabián Vena. Vena plays a Bon Vivant, similar to the Argentine comic book character Isidoro Cañones. Production Somos familia is produced by Quique Estevanez, who previously produced the successful telenovela Dulce amor, also aired by Telefe. It is written by Marcelo Nacci and Laura Barneix. The closing credits of the first episodes did not mention Nacci and Barneix, which sparked criticism from author unions such as Argentores and the Asociación de Autores Audiovisuales. Argentores even sent a legal document requiring the correction of the closing credits. As the problem continued, Argentores sent two more legal documents on February 6. The theme song, \\"Somos familia\\", was composed by Argentine artist Thian, who writes theme songs for TV programs, and performed by Spanish artist Álex Ubago. The song was produced in Spain in June 2013 by Rubén Caballero. The song also features Ricardo Urbina on drums, Joseba San Sebastián on bass, Rubén Caballero on guitar, Txus Aranburu on keyboard, and Laura Latienda in the chorus. The program was first aired during Ubago's 2014 tour in Argentina. Reception The program, which had been awaited for months, was aired when the telenovela Solamente Vos at Channel 13 was nearing its end. Somos familia garnered a higher rating.

It says that a strategy profile of a finite extensive-form game is a subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) if and only if there exist no profitable one-shot deviations for each subgame and every player. In simpler terms, if no player can increase their payoffs by deviating a single decision, or period, from their original strategy, then the strategy that they have chosen is a SPE. As a result, no player can profit from deviating from the strategy for one period and then reverting to the strategy. Furthermore, the one-shot deviation principle is very important for infinite horizon games, in which the principle typically does not holdObara, I. (2012). Subgame Perfect Equilibrium [PDF document]. Slide 13. Retrieved from http://www.econ.ucla.edu/iobara/SPE201B.pdf, since it is not plausible to consider an infinite number of strategies and payoffs in order to solve. In an infinite horizon game where the discount factor is less than 1, a strategy profile is a subgame perfect equilibrium if and only if it satisfies the one-shot deviation principleOzdaglar, A.

Definitions  The following is the paraphrased definition from Watson (2013) To check whether strategy s is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, we have to ask every player i and every subgame, if considering s, there is a strategy s’ that yields a strictly higher payoff for player i than does s in the subgame. This analysis is equivalent to looking at single deviations from s, meaning s’ differs from s at only one information set. Note that the choices associated with s and s’ are the same at all nodes that are successors of nodes in the information set where s and s’ prescribe different actions.  Example  Consider a symmetric game with two players in which each player makes binary choice decisions, A or B, in three sequences. Note, that each player only first sees the opposing sequence once three characters has been selected. There are 8 (23) total number of pure strategies for each player: {AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, BBB, BBA, BAB, BAA}. In this example, consider that a player chooses strategy (AAA). To check whether this strategy is a SPE, the one-shot deviation principle states that the player needs to check the payoffs of only three other strategies which differ from the original strategy by a single deviation, instead of all seven others. These three strategies are: (BAA), (ABA), and (AAB). If none of these three strategies yields a higher payoff than (AAA), then the player can conclude that (AAA) is an SPE.

They went public after years of being secretive about their polygamous lifestyle to promote the decriminalization of polygamy in the United States as well as to help reshape the perception of polygamy following the prosecution of Warren Jeffs. In 2013, the Darger family met with Utah legislators in an effort to persuade them to change the laws against polygamy in the state. Aspects of the HBO series Big Love were inspired by the family, including storylines which mirrored events in their lives. They have also been featured on the TLC series Sister Wives, which follows the Browns, another polygamous family. They also appeared on a TLC special called My Three Wives. History Joe, Vicki, Valerie, and Alina all grew up in polygamist families. Joe Darger was 20 years old when he married Alina and Vicki in 1990. In a move that is unusual even in polygamous communities, he courted and married Vicki and Alina simultaneously. Joe married Valerie 10 years later, following her divorce from another polygamous family. Valerie and Vicki are identical twin sisters. Together, the family has 25 children, including 5 children from Valerie's previous marriage. They describe themselves as independent fundamentalist Mormons. Like many polygamous families, the Dargers lived a secretive lifestyle for many years because of the fear of discrimination and of criminal charges. At the time, polygamy was a third degree felony which carried a sentence of up to 5 years in prison. In March 2001, Kyra Darger, the five-month-old daughter of Joe and Alina, died suddenly. It was later discovered that she was born with a heart defect that went undiagnosed. Despite the determination that she died from natural causes, there was no abuse or neglect, and the child received regular medical care, the family underwent a long investigation on the basis that they were polygamists. Their anger over the treatment of their family inspired the Dargers to work to change the way polygamous families were treated. They did a series of national interviews, often using aliases to protect their privacy. The perception of polygamy in America took a blow in 2006 when the criminal prosecution of FLDS leader Warren Jeffs uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors in the sect. Following the negative publicity of polygamy within the FLDS, the Dargers decided to come forward in an effort to reshape how society views polygamous families. They wrote a book entitled Love Times Three: Our True Story of a Polygamous Marriage.

Drummond Wolff was known for his close ties to the far right. Political career From early in his political career, Drummond Wolff's outlook was defined by his twin hatreds for laissez-faire capitalism and socialism, opinions that would lead him to become sympathetic to fascism as an alternative.Newton, p. 152 In 1934, Viscount Lymington resigned as MP for Basingstoke, after becoming disillusioned with party politics.Pugh, p. 148 Nonetheless, he helped to ensure that his successor as Conservative candidate would be Drummond Wolff, a close political associate. Drummond Wolff was duly elected in the resulting by-election, but he held the seat for only a year, resigning ostensibly due to ill health, although in fact because he shared Lymington's lack of faith in democracy. Despite that, both men were involved in the selection of the next MP, Patrick Donner, who also had close links to the far right. Despite being himself of Jewish ancestry, he was the great grandson of Joseph Wolff, Drummond Wolff was a notorious supporter of anti- Semitism and known for supporting the British Union of Fascists (BUF),, he also donated £1,000 to the BUF.Dorril, p. 278 During his brief parliamentary career, he spoke in support of Oswald Mosley, along with other BUF-linked Tories such as Patrick Hannon, John Moore-Brabazon, Vice-Admiral E. A. Taylor and Thomas Moore.Dorril, p. 299 Correspondence between Drummond Wolff and an election agent also indicates that, before Donner's selection as Conservative candidate for the 1935 general election could be ratified, he had had to be interviewed by Oswald Mosley, with the Basingstoke Conservative Party as a whole closely linked to the BUF.Dorril, p. 364 Such was the notoriety of Drummond Wolff with regards to his support for Nazism that he was used as an unofficial intermediary with Nazi Germany during the late 1930s. He was one of a number of leading British figures who regularly visited Germany in 1939 to hold talks with representatives of the Nazi government in an effort to avert war. Officially, such talks were not sanctioned by the government but in fact they were generally arranged with the support of Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, his Undersecretary R.A. Butler, or even Neville Chamberlain himself.Pugh, p. 282 In 1939, Conservative Central Office operative and former MI5 spy, Sir Joseph Ball, acting on behalf of Chamberlain, facilitated four lengthy visits to Germany by Drummond Wolff, who undertook negotiations with Helmuth Wohlthat and Walther Hewel, political advisers to Hermann Göring and Adolf Hitler respectively, amongst others.Pugh, p. 283 In the last of those trips, Drummond Wolff even held talks with Göring himself. However, the meeting accomplished little because, by that point, Drummond Wolff was so pro- Nazi that he would agree with the Nazi view and simply present it to the government, rather than suggesting compromises. A leading industrialist, his visits to Germany were excused as being on behalf of the Council of Empire Industries Association, of which Drummond Wolff was a leading member.Donald Cameron Watt, How War Came: The Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938-1939, Random House, 1989, p. 396 In 1934, he had become a member of the committee of the group which sought to promote trade between the countries within the British Commonwealth and the British Empire, .Newton, p. 151 Although close to the BUF, Drummond Wolff did maintain some independence and, as war loomed, he joined Arthur Bryant in establishing Union and Reconstruction, a propaganda organisation that aimed to agitate against any proposed war with Germany. One of a number of similar movements active at the time, it had little influence outside far right circles.Pugh, p. 290 Drummond Wolff argued that war with Germany was being promoted by the press, which he claimed was controlled by Jews and leftists, as well as by war capitalists of the United States, and by the Soviet Union which, he argued, saw war as an opportunity for world revolution. He also argued that a war against Germany was not winnable, because the country could not be attacked by land or sea and so an air war would ensue, something that he felt the Luftwaffe would inevitably win. As war loomed, Drummond Wolff began to moderate his pro-Nazi stance and even published a paper in which he argued that, as a means of avoiding war, Britain could help foment a revolution within Germany, not as a means of removing Hitler, but rather of distracting him from international concerns and forcing him to focus internally.Dorril, p. 470 The Duke of Westminster, a staunch opponent of war with Germany, was impressed by Drummond Wolff's plan and read it to influential anti-war activists, but nothing came of it. The group became dormant soon after the outbreak of war, and Drummond Wolff withdrew from politics.Pugh, p. 312 Personal life Drummond Wolff was the grandson of Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, himself also a Conservative MP.Henry Drummond Wolff Bibliography *Dorril, Stephen, Blackshirt: Sir Oswald Mosley and British Fascism, Penguin: 2007 *Newton, Scott, Profits of Peace: The Political Economy of Anglo-German Appeasement: The Political Economy of Anglo-German Appeasement, Oxford University Press: 1996 *Pugh, Martin, \\"Hurrah for the Blackshirts!\\": Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the Wars, Pimlico: 2006 References Category:1899 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1931–1935 Category:Antisemitism in the United Kingdom Category:English industrialists ","title":"Henry Drummond Wolff (Basingstoke MP)"},{"id":"41847426","text":"The Indiana Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) is a law enforcement training academy located in Plainfield, Indiana.

It originally aired on January 28, 2010. The episode was written by Barbie Kligman and Brian Young and directed by Liz Friedlander. Plot Stefan (Paul Wesley) gives Elena (Nina Dobrev) jewelries filled with vervain that he made for her, family and friends to protect them. At the same time, the doorbell rings, Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) opens the door and a delivery guy (Dillon Casey) is at the door. He invites him in and calls Elena to pay him. As the delivery guy walks away, he pulls his hoodie back on revealing that he is the vampire Elena hit with her car. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) looks for their dad's journal when Stefan gets in and tries to find out why Damon wanted to go to Atlanta. He asks him what Bree told him but Damon will not tell. Stefan later gives him their dad journal trying once again to find out what Damon's after. He tells him that he'll help him to free Katherine but Damon declines his offer. Jeremy gets an A for his history paper while Alaric (Matt Davis) tries to see if Jeremy believes in the stories about vampires. He then asks if he could read the source Jeremy used, the journal, and Jeremy gives it to him. Elena gives Caroline (Candice Accola) a necklace with vervain and asks about her relationship with Matt (Zach Roerig). Caroline feels awkward and tells her that they are just friends but Elena reassures her that she is fine if she wants to date him. Meanwhile, Matt gets a job at the Grill as a busboy and Damon approaches Bonnie trying to make amends since he is gonna need her for his plan. Bonnie warns him to stay away from her and the bartender Ben (Sean Faris) comes to help her get rid of Damon. Meanwhile, Elena gets a phone call from a stranger. Elena realizes who he is (the guy she hit with her car) and when she spots him across the street she drives away. She informs Stefan about the phone call and Stefan gives her the Gilbert watch explaining her how it works. Anna (Malese Jow) finds Jeremy at the Grill and he thanks her for her help regarding his history paper. Anna keeps talking about vampires but Jeremy still does not believe in the stories and tries to get away. Anna tries to ask him out but Jeremy leaves for the school dance. She later goes to the school dance herself and finds him, asking him for Jonathan's journal. Jeremy says that he lent it to Alaric, something that makes Anna upset and her face change (Anna is a vampire). Jeremy notices but she tells him it is nothing and she walks away. At the Gilbert house, Elena faces Jenna (Sara Canning) and asks the truth about her adoption. Jenna tells her that her parents helped a pregnant teenage girl to give birth but she then disappeared. Her parents were trying for a long time for a baby and they decided to keep her as their own. Her father made all the necessary paper work and when Elena asks if she knows anything more about her birth mother, Jenna says only her name; Isobel. While Elena is getting ready for the dance, the watch is activated meaning that a vampire is close. Elena freaks out and calls Stefan immediately. Damon answers letting her know that Stefan is on his way but he forgot his cell. Elena calms down thinking that the watch was activated because of Stefan but she gets attacked by Noah. Stefan gets there in time and saves her with Noah running away. Damon joins Stefan and Elena trying to find out what Noah wanted. Damon suggests to use Elena as a bait at the dance to find him before he comes back at the house. Elena agrees and they all leave for the dance. Elena catches up with Bonnie and Caroline and then the two girls leave the dance because they are not having fun and go to the Grill. At the Grill, Bonnie decides to take the first step and approaches Ben asking him out. Caroline tries to do the same with Matt but he is upset with her regarding something she said to Bonnie earlier and he overheard it. Caroline apologizes but Matt tells her that he does not know if he got over Elena yet and that is why he does not want to ruin what the two of them have at the moment, their friendship. Caroline says he already did and leaves. Matt changes his mind and follows her with his car. He stops her and he finally kisses her. Back at the dance, Elena and Stefan keep dancing while Alaric approaches Damon and introduces himself. He starts asking questions until Damon gets suspicious and Alaric backs off. In the meantime, Noah got into the dance and Anna spies him. They seem to know each other while she warns him to stay away from Elena since she is not Katherine and the Salvatores are with her. Noah does not hear her and continues his hunt for Elena. Anna tells him that she did not get the journal yet but she knows where it is. Elena finally spots Noah and tells Stefan who goes after him but Stefan is following the wrong guy since Noah gave his hoodie to a teenage boy. He realizes that he was tricked to leave Elena alone and runs back to her. Meanwhile, Noah calls Elena and asks her to exit through the side door, otherwise he will kill Jeremy, so Elena follows his instructions. She tries to run away but Noah catches up to her in the cafeteria. The two of them struggle and the moment he is about to bite her, Stefan and Damon arrive. Noah tries to escape but Stefan stakes him in the gut to make him suffer but not kill him, while he starts asking him what he wants. Noah explains that he is after Elena because he looks like Katherine and Damon and Stefan are surprised to know they were not the only ones Katherine played with. They do not remember Noah but he remembers them and he also gives them information that they need the \\"Grimoire\\" to get into the tomb. They can find more info in Jonathan Gilbert's journal. They ask him who he is working with but he will not tell, so Stefan kills him. Anna watches the whole scene between the brothers and Noah but she hides as she hears Alaric approaching. Alaric sees the moment Stefan kills Noah and he walks away like he knows nothing. Damon follows him and compels him to tell him what he knows. Alaric, even compelled, lies to him and Damon walks away. It is revealed that Alaric, who is stunned after the confrontation, was holding vervain in his hand. Damon and Stefan discuss what happened and suspect that Noah is not alone. Stefan tells Damon that he knows he is looking for Emily's journal (which is the Grimiore Noah was talking about) to reverse the spell and he repeats his offer to help him free Katherine as long as he is there and the other vampires will stay behind. Damon trusts him and accepts his offer. Stefan tells Elena about his promise to Damon later at home but he informs her that his promise was a lie. Meanwhile, Alaric walks Jenna home and asks her out for a date which Jenna accepts. While they are talking, Alaric mentions his wife's name was Isobel and that she was from not far away from Mystic Falls. Jenna looks at him in shock, realizing that his wife is Elena's birth mother. The episode ends with Anna stalking Ben while he is closing the Grill and walks home. She attacks him but he fights back revealing that he is also a vampire. The supposed to be fight turns into a play and it is revealed that Ben also works with Anna and Noah and his job is to get close to Bonnie. Anna and Ben kiss before they walk away together.

History = Foundation  A camp for army recruits was established at the site in 1910. The air field was built in 1934. Over the next few years, hangars and facilities for five squadrons were built. The first of these was a command squadron for the air wing. It was followed by a fighter squadron and a reconnaissance squadron of each of two army divisions.  World War II  The Fokker C.V reconnaissance aircraft and Fokker D.XXI fighters stationed at the air base were tasked with the defense of Copenhagen but many of them were not combat ready when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany since their locally produced machine guns had not yet been installed. At 05:25 am on 9 April 1940, the air base was attacked by Messerschmitt Bf 110 aircraft of the German Luftwaffe. During the attack, which came in five waves and only lasted about 45 minutes, almost all of the Danish aircraft were destroyed. A reconnaissance aircraft which had just taken off was shot down, killing its crew. The Germans were only aiming for aircraft, leaving the air base infrastructure intact for their own later use. The airfield was used by the German Luftwaffe during the rest of the war, stationing several units there. It was also used for captured Allied aircraft, such as a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress of the United States Army Air Forces in 1944. Towards the end of the war, as the German Eastern Front began to collapse, flights with refugees from East Prussia and the Baltic states began coming to the airfield. At the time of the capitulation, 131 aircraft had accumulated at the base. Immediately after the war, the airfield served as a refugee camp.  Post-war history  The Danish army returned in early 1946. A Flight Mechanics School opened at the base in March 1947. The Royal Danish Air Force was founded in October 1950 through the merger of Royal Danish Army Air Corps and the Royal Danish Naval Air Services. In January 1951 Værløse became the home of the Danish Air Command (Flyvertaktisk Kommando)and Eastern Command. It also became home to the Royal Danish Air Force Officers School and the Air Force Sergeant and Reserve Officer School. Eskadrille 722, a light transport squadron, was also formed at the base. When it was transformed into a SAR unit, a station flight was established for minor transport duties. In 1952, a planned upgrade of the runways to handle jet aircraft resulted in a lot of controversy in the Danish media. Copenhagen municipality supported the local parish council since area would stretch all the way to Søndersø Waterworks, which had just been refurbished for many millions. It was proposed to move the air base to the north of Sjælland, but the Ministry of Defense deemed it too expensive to move the air base. The new, NATO standard runway was completed in late 1953. Eastern Command moved to Karup after being merged with Western Command in 1955. It was replaced by the Training Command at Værløse. Eskadrille 721 arrived at the airfield in May 1956. In 1974 and 1975 the airfield received another update. A new hangar and 12 concrete shelters were also built in relation with NATOs rapid response plan. A new control tower and a passenger terminal and operations bunker completed the update. Most of Værløse Air Base was closed down on 1 April 2004. The last flying units moved to Karup, Aalborg and Skalstrup.  Redevelopment  The North Camp (Nordlejren) at Værløse was built in 1912-13. 21 October 2004 Kuben Byg A/S won a tender to buy 94 hectares of land to develop. May 2005 an agreement was reached between the interior minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and the municipalities of Værløse and Farum to transfer for free the unsold land and buildings of the former airfield to the future Furesø Municipality. As of 2016 the redeveloped North Camp, called Laanshøj, situated 3 kilometers west of Værløse, is home to over 500 inhabitants. In 2013, the Danish Culture Agency took over most of the North Camp, including two large hangars which will be used for exhibitions and other cultural activities. The Danish Nature Agency took over the central green spaces. The South Camp will be redeveloped into a mixed-use neighbourhood by Freja Ejendomme in collaboration with Furesø municipality.

It was first seen at the DEFEXPO 2014 exhibition. As of 2015, the rifle is also known as the Advanced Automatic Rifle (AAR) and also as the F-INSAS rifle. History The Indian Army chose an indigenous assault rifle to replace the INSAS rifle currently in service. The decision, which could save money in foreign exchange and boost local manufacture, was made by the former Chief of Army Staff, General Dalbir Singh Suhag. Several rifles are currently undergoing small arms trials with three prototype rifles made for testing as a future replacement to the INSAS rifle. The MCIWS has also found interest with the Indian paramilitary forces including the Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Indo- Tibetan Border Police and the Sashastra Seema Bal.PDF file of Indian defence review, 2015 According to a DRDO September 18, 2018 newsletter, the MCIWS is now ready for serial production.https://web.archive.org/web/20180921114913/https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/pub/newsletter/2018/Sep_18.pdf In October 2017, the MCIWS procurement was superseded by an Army process to acquire around 7 lakh 7.62mm calibre rifles. In February 2019, the Indian Army signed a deal with SIG Sauer for the supply of 72,400 SIG716 G2 Patrol rifles of 7.62x51mm calibre. This was followed by a second order for a similar number of rifles in July 2020. On 3 March 2019, Russia and India inaugurated Indo- Russia Rifles in Uttar Pradesh, India to produce 7.62x39mm AK-203 assault rifles as a replacement for the INSAS. However, no contract has been signed or rifles produced because of pricing disagreements. The factory is unlikely to begin production in 2020. Design The MCIWS is configured to fire in 5.56×45mm NATO, 7.62×39mm and in 6.8mm Remington SPC. Its design is influenced by both the AR-15 and the FN FNC. The barrel assembly appears to be based on the AK-47. The design would allow soldiers to configure it according to the needs of the missions by changing rifle barrels. The MCIWS uses a gas-operated short stroke piston design, and uses 30-round plastic-type magazines. The rifle also has ambidextrous features, such as the charging lever and magazine release. The MCIWS includes an indigenous under barrel grenade launcher to fire airburst-type grenades which can take out targets up to 500 meters. Various sights can be mounted on the Picatinny rail on the upper receiver. The rifle is of aluminium alloy and features a modular, rivet-less design.

This has often been linked to nationalist and separatist movements (separating countries), while other acts have been related to politics (including anarchism, far-right and far-left extremism), religious extremism, or organized crime. Terrorism in the European sections of the intercontinental countries of Turkey and Russia are not included in this list. History=Definitions Defining terrorism is difficult, and there are more than one hundred definitions of it in scholarly literature. The term is used in polemical contexts, thus it can become a move in a campaign rather than an aid to thought. A simple definition would be \\"use of force against innocent people for political purposes\\". Some scholars argue that there is no true or correct definition due to terrorism being an abstract concept without a real presence. Legal definitions contain internal contradictions and might be misused. There is an overlap between terrorism and various other forms of conflict and violent action, including civil wars\\"Defining Civil War by Examining Post-Soviet Conflicts\\" by Pavel K. Baev, Terrorism and Political Violence, 19(2), 247-268. doi:10.1080/09546550701246965 or non-international armed conflicts. This is the case with several significant non-international conflicts in Europe, where there thus can be dispute as to what counts as terrorism: examples include the Irish War of Independence (1919–21), the breakup of Yugoslavia and subsequent conflicts,\\"Approaches to political violence and terrorism in former Yugoslavia 1\\" by Florian Bieber, Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans 2003, 5(1): 39-51 the First (1994–6) and Second Chechen Wars (1999–2009), and the War of Dagestan (1999). Early history In the Middle Ages, maritime nations in Europe sponsored pirates and privateering against rivals, which can be compared to terrorism.\\"West European Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism: The Evolving Dynamic\\" by P Chalk. 1996: Macmillan Press Ltd. p. 2\\"1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created\\", Charles C. Mann, 2011 The term \\"terror\\" is used about the reign of terror in France, carried out by the Jacobins in 1792-4. Modern trends Terrorist Attacks in the EU by Affiliation Updated.pngAttacks Terrorist Arrests in the EU by Affiliation Updated.pngArrests Terrorism in Europe around the beginning of the twentieth century was often associated with anarchism.The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al Qaeda by Gérard Chaliand & Arnaud BlinRichard Jensen, \\"Daggers, rifles and dynamite: Anarchist terrorism in nineteenth century Europe.\\" Terrorism and Political Violence 2004, 16(1):116-53 Terrorism within the European Communities since 1951 has often been linked to separatist movements, including the Irish Republican Army within the United Kingdom, and Euskadi Ta Askatasuna within Spain. Other perpetrators have been linked to far-right and far-left extremism, environmental extremism and anarchism. Since 2001, there has been an increase in attacks linked to extremist Islamist groups, particularly in France. Many separatist terrorist activities also have a religious angle, as, for example, with Chechen separatism in Russia. The internationally co-ordinated element has seen increasing attempts by governments to seek to weaken extremist ideology, particularly Islamic extremism. It remains the case that the majority of deaths from terrorism do not occur in the \\"West\\". When the Al Qaeda attacks against the United States in 2001 are excluded, only 0.5% of all deaths from terrorism have occurred in Western countries - European nations, United States, Canada and Australia - in the years 2000-14. There have been recent increases in the number of high-fatality attacks. There had been a decrease in the number of overall fatalities from terrorist attacks between 1990 and 2015, compared to those between 1970 and 1990. Prior to 1990, on average 150 people died each year from terrorist attacks; this figure would be even higher if the large number of people who died in 1988 from the Pan Am 2013 bombing were included. From 1990, an average of a little under 50 people died each year. There was an increase of fatalities from 2011, with the attacks by far-right extremist Anders Breivik in Norway, and Islamist extremist attacks in France in 2015 and 2016. Europol has published an annual trend report on terrorist attacks (including failed, foiled, and completed attacks) and terrorist-related arrests in the EU since 2006. The reports identify that perpetrators' known or suspected affiliations have been disparate in nature. Europol break these down into five categories: jihadist terrorism (previously termed \\"religiously-inspired terrorism\\"); ethno- nationalist and separatist terrorism; left-wing and anarchist terrorism; right-wing terrorism; and single-issue terrorism. Europol's reports do not provide a breakdown of the proportion of attacks that have been completed or the type of damage inflicted. According to these data, the vast majority of terrorist attacks in the EU between 2006 and 2013 were affiliated with ethnonational or separatist motives, followed by left-wing and anarchist attacks, and those that are registered as 'unspecified'. A significant number of terror attacks were motivated religiously or associated with right-wing groups. Among those arrested on terror-related crimes, most were religiously motivated and form the largest group, followed by separatist related terror suspects. In 2015, a total of 211 completed, failed, or foiled terrorist attacks were reported by EU states, resulting in 151 fatalities (of which 148 were in France, with 130 of them occurring during the November 2015 Paris attacks) and over 360 people injured. As in previous years, separatist attacks accounted for the largest proportion (65), followed by jihadist attacks (17). Jihadist attacks caused the largest number of fatalities (150) and injuries (250). The United Kingdom reported the largest number of attacks (103) but did not provide statistics on suspected affiliation. Tackling jihadist terrorism threats has become an over-riding priority for security services, although many commentators express concerns that the risk of far-right terrorism is currently being underestimated. In 2017, British intelligence MI5 said that Northern Ireland is the most concentrated area of terrorist activity \\"probably anywhere in Europe\\", with weekly threats from dissident Irish republicans. Europol report all deaths from terrorist activity in 2018 were caused by jihadist terrorism. As of 2019, Europol reported that left-wing terrorist groups in the EU had appeared to have ceased their operational activities. Prevention=International cooperation European Police Office (Europol) in The Hague. Cover of the Terrorism Situation and Trend Report (TE-SAT) 2017 European states were at the fore of plans for an international criminal court under the League of Nations in the 1930s, working through the Committee for the Repression of Terrorism (CRT). The CRT sought to define terrorism and get nation's domestic policies to support anti-terrorism activities. Opposition by Britain and tensions over fascism in Germany and Italy limited the final proposals. Current European cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism includes the European Police Office (Europol), an EU agency, and Interpol. TREVI was an early example of EU cooperation in this field. The main transnational activity to combat terrorism in recent years has been through Europol. They have categorised acts of terrorism that have either failed, been foiled or been successfully executed within the European Union (EU) as either pertaining to religious issues, right-wing, left-wing or separatist movements. The field is subject to considerable cooperation among national authorities. National authorities In July 2014 the Government of France introduced legislation to combat terrorism by toughening surveillance, making it lawful to detain individuals linked to radical \\"Islamist\\" groups, and to block Internet sites that incite anti-Semitism, terrorism and hatred. The country's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve revealed 600 French nationals were in Syria at the time or planned to go there. The bill includes a ban on foreign travel for up to six months for those believed to hold terrorist sympathies, provides for the confiscation and invalidation of passports, and prohibits airlines from allowing such individuals to fly. From 2005, the United Kingdom government introduced the CONTEST strategy, which seeks to improve co-operation between security services, and other public and private organisations. This includes four strands, namely Pursue, (seeking to apprehend potential terrorists), Prevent, (seeking to reduce risks of 'radicalisation', deter potential terrorists and share information), Protect, (seeking to ensure the security of potential targets and organisations is optimised), and Prepare, (seeking to ensure an effective response in the immediate aftermath of any attack). Similar strategies have been adopted by other countries across the European Union, and there have been increases in co-operation between nations and security forces. One year after Albanian government sacked Iran’s Ambassador to Tirana in December 2018, in the 2nd week of January 2020, this country expelled two other Iranian diplomats. The two were said to be members of Quds Force which up to recently was commanded by Qassem Soleimani.Albania Expels Iranian Diplomats Amid Worsening Relations Incidents=Deadliest attacks The following is a list of terrorist incidents in Europe which resulted in at least ten civilian deaths.

Education  Marthe Gautier discovered a vocation for pediatrics at an early age. In 1942 she joined her sister Paulette who was about to complete her medical studies in Paris intending to become a pediatrician. She passed the entrance exam of the \\"Internat des hôpitaux de Paris\\" and spent the next four years as an intern gaining clinical experience in pediatrics. In 1955 she submitted and defended her thesis in pediatric cardiology under the direction of Robert Debré. Her thesis focused on the study of clinical and anatomical pathology of fatal forms of rheumatic fever (rheumatic endocarditis) due to streptococcus infection. Robert Debré, in charge of pediatrics in France at the time, offered Gautier a scholarship for one year at Harvard University in order to acquire knowledge in pediatric cardiology with two main objectives. The first was to eradicate rheumatic fever, using penicillin and the treatment of sometimes life-threatening cardiovascular disease with cortisone; the second was to create a department for diagnosis and surgery of congenital heart diseases for newborns and young children. In September 1955, Gautier left for Boston. She was accompanied by Jean Alcardi and Jacques Couvreur, both Fulbright scholars, and the three became the first interns of the Hôpitaux de Paris to be awarded scholarships for the US. At Harvard, one of the tasks of her internship was to be trained as a laboratory technician working on cell culture. Besides the two objectives that had been set initially, Gautier was also working half-time as a technician in a laboratory for cell culture to obtain in-vitro cultures of fibroblast starting from aorta fragments. After a year in Boston, Gautier returned to Paris. Meanwhile, her job in the pediatric cardiology service at the Bicêtre Hospital in Paris had been given to a colleague during her absence. However, she learned that there was a position available at the Trousseau Hospital, in Raymond Turpin's team. Turpin's research was focused on polymalformative syndromes, of which the most common is trisomy, characterized by intellectual disability and morphological abnormalities. At the time, Turpin favored the hypothesis of a chromosomal origin of trisomy but there was no laboratory for cell culture in France and the number of human chromosomes was estimated at 48, but without any certainty. Down syndrome=Laboratory cell culture In 1956, biologists from Lund University in Sweden announced that humans have exactly 46 chromosomes. Turpin had many years earlier proposed the idea of culturing cells to count the number of chromosomes in trisomy. Gautier had recently joined the pediatrics group he headed at the Armand-Trousseau Hospital, and she offered to attempt this, since she had been trained in both cell culture and tissue staining techniques in the United States. Turpin agreed to provide her with tissue samples from patients with Down syndrome. With very limited resources Gautier set up the first in vitro cell culture laboratory in France.\\"The history of cytogenetics Portraits of some pioneers\\" S. Gilgenkrantz & E.M. Rivera, 2003 in \\"Annales de génétique\\" In order to count the chromosomes, Gautier worked on fibroblasts derived from connective tissue, which were easier to obtain under local anesthesia. Although the principle of cell culture is simple, there were many practical obstacles to getting it to work under the primitive conditions available to Gautier, who was forced to use a personal loan to purchase laboratory glassware and, at times, her own blood as a source of human serum. She eventually confirmed that the protocol worked, using connective tissue from a neighbouring surgeon, taken during planned interventions in children. She used the \\"hypotonic shock\\" methodJ.-H. Tjio et A. Levan, Hereditas, 42, 1, 1956. followed by drying the slide after attachment in order to disperse the chromosomes of dividing cells and make them easier to count. Using this protocol, Gautier found that the cells of normal children have 46 chromosomes. In May 1958, she observed an additional chromosome in the cells of a trisomic boy, the first evidence of chromosomal abnormalities in individuals with Down syndrome.  Announcement of results  At the time, the laboratories at the Armand-Trousseau hospital did not have a microscope capable of capturing images of the slides. Gautier entrusted her slides to Jérôme Lejeune, an intern at CNRS, who offered to take pictures in another laboratory better equipped for this task. In August 1958 the photographs identified the supernumerary chromosome in Down syndrome patients. However Lejeune did not return the slides, but instead reported the discovery as his own. In January 1959, by studying new cases and to forestall similar research by the English, the Trousseau laboratory announced the results of the analysis of the slides in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences through a paper published with Lejeune as first author, Gautier second (her surname misspelled) and Turpin last author. The Turpin team identified the first translocation and the first chromosomal deletion, resulting in publications Gautier co-signed.  Attribution of the discovery  In April 1960, the condition was named trisomy 21. As of 1970 the Lejeune foundation started to promote the discovery as sole work of Lejeune omitting the co-authors. Gautier has told how she was put to one side by Turpin and by Lejeune who claimed responsibility for the discovery, even though it relied on the work that she had initiated and directed technically. Aware of having been manipulated Gautier decided to abandon trisomy 21 and to return to caring for children affected by cardiopathy.'The history of cytogenetics Portraits of some pioneers' S. Gilgenkrantz, E.M. Rivera, University of Nancy (France) & Michigan State University (USA) , On 31 January 2014, Gautier was due to speak about her role in the discovery at the seventh biennial congress on human and medical genetics in Bordeaux, and to receive the grand prize of the French Federation of Human Genetics. The Jérôme Lejeune Foundation obtained authorisation from the Bordeaux Tribunal de Grande Instance for bailiffs to be sent to film this session. At the last minute, concerned that the recording might be used in legal proceedings it could not afford to defend, the congress organisers decided to cancel her presentation and she received her award privately instead. The ethics committee of the INSERM has issued a note in July 2014, reminding the decisive role of Marthe Gautier, and has built upon this case to remind the international rules currently in vigor for scientific publications and authors list. The note precises that \\"history of discovery is not identical to the history of science, and the process of validating knowledge remains very different«. The technical approach is a necessary condition for discovery- key role of Marthe Gautier : but quite often it must be extended pour make recognition emerge priori contribution of Raymond Turpin and thereafter Jérôme Lejeune. As the discovery of trisomy would have been impossible without the mandatory contributions of Raymond Turpin and Marthe Gautier, it is regrettable that their names were not sustematically associated with this discovery, as much in terms of communication but also in the assignement of various awards and distinctions.\\"http://presse.inserm.fr/jeudi-25-septembre-2014/15704/ Marthe Gautier was directly appointed to the rank of Officer of the French Legion of Honorhttp://www.legiondhonneur.fr/sites/default/files/promotion/lh_20140420_1.pdf and was decorated on September 16th, 2014. Marthe Gautier has, in the past, declined this distinction twice before consenting to it \\"by indignation towards the impudence of the Lejeune Foundation\\". She was promoted Commander of the National Order of Merit on 15 November 2018.https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000037615089&dateTexte;=&categorieLien;=id  Medical career  After the trisomy discovery Gautier left Turpin's team and applied for a position in public health care to dedicate herself to cardio-pediatrics. She was hired by Professor Nouaille in a newly opened service at the Hospital Kremlin Biccetre. Subsequently, she became Master of Research at the INSERM. Gautier is currently in retirement.

He is known for editing the celebrated journal Der hinkende Bote am Rhein (The Limping Messenger on the Rhine) between 1849 and 1891. Biography Daniel Hirtz, 1873 Hirtz did not begin studies until the age of 12, when he attended the Protestant Jean Sturm Gymnasium before beginning an apprenticeship with his father, a master turner. In 1823 he began his journeyman years around Europe to perfect his craft. He first visited Switzerland before travelling all over Germany. In Merseburg he wrote the poem Der Fürstenring (The Prince's Ring), which gained considerable success in Alsace. In Berlin, he worked with the master-turner Engel and assisted on the wedding furniture of the Prince Royal Frederick William, the future King of Prussia. In Hildesheim he wrote the popular tale Der Dom zu Hildesheim (Hildesheim Cathedral). In 1827 he returned to Strasbourg where he set up his own workshop two years later, becoming well-respected as both a craftsman and a poet. For the 400th anniversary of the completion of Strasbourg Cathedral on 24 June 1839, he read his poem Das Münsterfest (The Minster Celebration) to the crowd assembled on the platform. The Magistrate of Strasbourg entrusted Hirtz with arranging the Turners Guild party for the parade of guilds in honour of Johannes Gutenberg in 1840, as well as with writing new poetry for the occasion. His piece Die Bischofswahl (The Election of the Bishop), printed by the Frankfurt journal Didaskalia, brought him wide renown. From 1849 he was employed by the Church of the Confession in Augsburg and became editor of Das hinkende Bote am Rhein. In his old age he retired to the Deaconry in Strasbourg where he died some years later. There is a street in the Orangerie district of Strasbourg that bears his name, located at . Children Georg Daniel Hirtz had one son and one daughter. His son, also called Georg Daniel, enlisted in the army so as not to become a pastor. He led an adventurous life, and after the German annexation of 1871, returned to Alsace to become a tax collector in Bischwiller. The younger Hirtz died in 1887, leaving behind several works in both German and Alsatian. His sister and Georg Daniel Sr.'s daughter, Sophie Catherine Hirtz, married Jean-Georges Groetzinger, a Lutheran Pasteur from Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, Alsace, France.

Early life and education Mori was born in 1958 in Kurashiki, Okayama. In the elementary school era, he was good at mathematics and arithmetic, and learned from the newspaper about the existence of quarks. In the middle school era, he was influenced by the Nobel Prize in Physics of Hideki Yukawa, and he decided to study physics at the Faculty of Science at Kyoto University (at the time, the golden age of elementary particle physics). However, he was finally admitted to the Department of Synthetic Chemistry of the Faculty of Engineering at Kyoto University.【関西の議論】ノーベル賞まであと一歩に迫る男、山中教授と同じラスカー賞獲得 ライバルとデッドヒート（1/3ページ） - 産経WEST When Mori was in the first year of college, he did not understand the significant difference between the laws of physics and chemistry, but he learned about the new development of molecular biology from newspaper articles. Soon after, Kyoto University alumnus Susumu Tonegawa won the first Japanese Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Tonegawa's award-winning research \\"Intercommunication between E. coli and Gene Mechanisms\\" shocked Mori, and he decided to transfer to the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and continue to pursue graduate studies. In 1985, he obtained a doctorate degree.【関西の議論】ノーベル賞まであと一歩に迫る男、山中教授と同じラスカー賞獲得 ライバルとデッドヒート（2/3ページ） - 産経WEST Career A simplified diagram of the initiation of the UPR by prolonged and overwhelming protein misfolding.

The independent works of Mori and Peter Walter during the same period revealed the UPR pathway, which explains the mechanism by which cells generate signals due to stress and regulate. They discovered the inositol- requiring enzyme 1 (Ire1) in 1993, which communicates the state of the endoplasmic reticulum protein production line. These research uncovered to form the basis for understanding and treating a wide range of important diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders including obesity, diabetes, fatty liver and dyslipidemia, a number of neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory diseases. In 2003, Mori was transferred to the Department of Biophysics (Division of Biological Sciences) of Graduate School of Science at Kyoto University, the academic unit is also the first laboratory for molecular biology in Japan and has a long history.

Turk Jr. Coal Plant is a base load 600-megawatt coal-fired power station in Fulton, Arkansas, operated by the American Electric Power subsidiary Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO). It provides power to customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. Named for former SWEPCO president and CEO John W. Turk Jr., the plant came online in 2012 as the first sustained \\"ultra\\"-supercritical coal plant in the United States, reaching boiler temperatures above and pressures above . The plant relies on low-sulfur coal from the Powder River Basin. Its construction was embroiled in regulatory roadblocks and environmental lawsuits. At a total cost of $1.8 billion, it was the most expensive project in Arkansas history. Litigation Though first proposed in 2006, lawsuits aiming to protect the environment surrounding the project's proposed site delayed its groundbreaking. Plaintiffs cited potential damage to the area's fish, wildlife, grasslands, and cypress and hardwood groves. As part of a settlement reached in December 2011 with the Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society, Audubon Arkansas and the Hempstead County Hunting Club, American Electric Power/SWEPCO agreed to close one of the 528-megawatt generating units at its J. Robert Welsh Power Plant in Texas by the end of 2016 and purchase 400 megawatts of renewable energy capacity by the end of 2014. The settlement also required the company to contribute $8 million to The Nature Conservancy, $2 million to the Arkansas Community Foundation, and reimburse $2 million in legal fees. American Electric Power/SWEPCO agreed to never install additional generating units at the plant or build another coal-fired facility within 30 miles. SWEPCO announced in January 2012 it had reached 20-year agreements to purchase 359 megawatts of wind power from sources in Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas, more than quadrupling its wind power portfolio. The Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority, 7 percent owner of the Turk plant, entered a 25-year agreement in 2012 to purchase 49 megawatts of wind power capacity. Generation American Electric Power/SWEPCO estimates the plant's ultra-supercritical combustion achieves between 39 and 40 percent efficiency. To overcome material stress from the plant's high pressure and temperature, engineers used new nickel and chrome alloys in the boiler and its components. Emissions and waste Compared to a conventional coal-fired plant of similar output, AEP/SWEPCO estimated the Turk facility's ultra- supercritical process would use 180,000 fewer tons of coal and produce 320,000 fewer tons of carbon dioxide annually. Ash and other solid waste is disposed of at an on-site landfill lined with a synthetic material. Emissions controls at the plant include selective catalytic reduction for nitrous oxide, flue-gas desulfurization for sulfur dioxide, activated carbon injection for mercury and pulse-jet fabric filter baghouse for particulate matter. Groundwater pollution In a report published in 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project found levels of lithium in groundwater near the plant are three times of safe limits. Utilities disputed the methodology used in the study. Greenhouse gases According to data reported to the EPA, the plant released 4,011,207 metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2017. The emissions in metric tons comprised: *Carbon dioxide: 3,979,770 *Methane: 11,500 *Nitrous oxide: 19,937 Recognition POWER Magazine awarded the plant its 2013 Plant of the Year Award. In 2015, Peabody Energy recognized the plant for the lowest nitrous oxide emission rate and lowest heat rate among U.S. coal-fired power plants.

The park is surrounded by industrial plants, the Hastings Racecourse, as well as access to the Port of Vancouver. During the summer, the park becomes a popular location for recreational activity. There is a soccer pitch, tennis courts, barbecue/picnic sites, two playgrounds, beaches, and an outdoor pool. For local residents, New Brighton Park provides a nearby location with similar facilities found at other popular recreational parks such as Kitsilano Beach, which is located on the west side of Vancouver. New Brighton Park is also in the process of being connected to Hastings Park via Creekway Park, which will allow people to walk and cycle between the two locations. History New Brighton was previously known as Hastings Townsite back in 1865, and is considered to be the original area in which Vancouver began. To recognize the significance of this area, the City of Vancouver laid a plaque in 1968 indicating that this area was where the first outlets were established in the city. These outlets included the first post office, roads, playing field, Canadian Pacific Railway office, docks, and museum. The plaque also reads that Hasting Townsite was the most fashionable watering place in all of British Columbia. The plaque reads > Here Vancouver Began. All was forest towering to the skies. British Royal > Engineers surveyed it into lots, 1863, and named the area \\"Hastings > Townsite\\" to honour Admiral Hastings, British Navy. Everything Began at > Hastings.

Lumbermans Arch, 2nd Beach, and Windermere pool were all 1/2 circle concrete pools until the 1970s when they were converted to freshwater pools. These pools were all free to use until the conversions, when fees were introduced. New Brighton Pool Pool at New Brighton Park New Brighton Pool is a public outdoor pool that is usually open from May to September. The pool features 25-meter swim lanes as well as a sloped or beach style entry for young children, inexperienced swimmers, and visitors using wheelchairs. Lessons and classes are also available during the summer season.New Brighton Pool details Dog walking New Brighton Park Dog Off-Leash Area New Brighton Park is also a dog-friendly park. There are specific areas in the park where dogs are allowed to be off-leash. This is between Windermere Street and Nootka Street, and E Waterfront Road. Dogs are allowed to be off-leash between May 1 to September 30 from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm and between October 1 to April 30 from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm. Sewage overflow Sewage outflow pipe at low tide New Brighton Park is one of the many locations in Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster, that sewage outflow occurs. Vancouver's current sewage system was built in the 1960s and is organized so that sewage output is mixed with rainwater collecting systems.http://www.metrovancouver.org/planning/ClimateChange/ClimateChangeDocs/Vulnerability_climate_change.pdf This is known as a combined sewer system. The reason for implementing such a system is that it is both cheaper to build and easier to maintain. Under normal circumstances this system is not an issue. However, when storms produce large amounts of rainwater the system overflows to nearby waterways. In most cases the piping is under water so that the public cannot see that sewage leaving, however, at New Brighton Park the piping is sometimes exposed at low tide. There have recently been some concerns raised about this current system in Vancouver due to the effects of climate change. It is predicted that rainfall rates will increase in the lower mainland due to changes in climate and this could cause an increase in the amount of overflow water being routed to the ocean. For this reason, Vancouver has committed to the gradual change from a combined sewer system to a separated sewer system by 2050. This would mean that only excess rainwater collected from streets and houses would be directed towards the ocean and all sewage would be processed by sewage treatment plants.

Plot Kiko is playing his flute in the woods, and spending some time with the birds, especially three young ones in a nest. The father of the birds comes to feed them with some grapes. While they are having their meal, a vicious fox approaches and scales their tree. Fortunately, Kiko and the birds spot the fox on time as they begin pelting grapes, prompting the predator to retreat into a cave below the cliff. It appears that the current day is the time that the young birds should be able to fly. They then take off from the edge of the cliff. One of them, however, still isn't ready, and therefore plunges into the bottom next to the cave. The fox sees this as an opportunity, and comes out. Kiko, upon noticing the trouble, jumps into the bottom and pounces on the fox. Kiko brawls with the fox but receives hits as well. Despite switching to defensive mode, the kangaroo is able to hurl the fox into a great distance. Kiko celebrates his win by marching on a country road, and playing on his flute Yankee Doodle.

Once he sets up a tug-of-war on tractors, breaks his tractor and nearly escapes criminal charges for that. Matvey is in love with the daughter of the chairman of the collective farm, Larissa, though her father strongly opposes their relationship. But soon Matvey and Larissa get married. Tonya, a livestock specialist, arrives at the farm from Leningrad. She becomes active in many changes in the life of the villagers, and inspires young people to build a new club. Matvey falls in love with Tonya, apparently attracted by an educated girl from the city, she loves him too and is struggling to contain and hide her feelings. But when he explains his feelings to her, Tonya says she \\"would not break his marriage\\". Meanwhile Larissa becomes terribly jealous. Alevtina, a newsmonger and the owner of local unofficial club, persuades Larissa to poison her rival, but at the last moment Larissa changes her mind and strikes the poisoned cup of tea from Tonya's hands.

It has been observed in electrophysiology studies of the brain and has been noted in many sensory neurons, most notably in the early visual system. Surround suppression is defined as a reduction in the activity of a neuron in response to a stimulus outside its classical receptive field. The necessary functional connections with other neurons influenced by stimulation outside a particular area and by dynamic processes in general, and the absence of a theoretical description of a system state to be treated as a baseline, deprive the term \\"classical receptive field\\" of functional meaning.The classical receptive field refers to a concept of neural behavior that was understood to be invalid virtually from the start. As Spillman et al (2015), quoting Kuffler (1953), \\"not only the areas from which responses can actually be set up by retinal illumination may be included in a definition of the receptive field but also all areas which show a functional connection, by an inhibitory or excitatory effect on a ganglion cell.\\" The descriptor \\"surround suppression\\" suffers from a similar problem, as the activities of neurons in the \\"surround\\" of the \\"classical receptive field are similarly determined by connectivities and processes involving neurons beyond it.) This nonlinear effect is one of many that reveals the complexity of biological sensory systems, and the connections of properties of neurons that may cause this effect (or its opposite) are still being studied. The characteristics, mechanisms, and perceptual consequences of this phenomenon are of interest to many communities, including neurobiology, computational neuroscience, psychology, and computer vision. Background Stimulation of the surround with the classical receptive field induces a response that is smaller than stimulation of the classical receptive field alone. Stimulation of the surround only has no effect. The classical model of early vision presumes that each neuron responds independently to a specific stimulus in a localized area of the visual field. (According to Carandini et al (2005), this computational model, which may be fit to various datasets, \\"degrade[s] quickly if we change almost any aspect of the test stimulus.\\") The stimulus and corresponding location in the visual field are collectively called the classical receptive field. However, not all effects can be explained by via ad hoc independent filters. Surround suppression is one of an infinite number of possible effects in which neurons do not behave according to the classical model. These effects are collectively called non- classical receptive field effects, and have recently become a substantial research area in vision and other sensory systems. During surround suppression, neurons are inhibited by a stimulus outside their classical receptive field, in an area loosely termed deemed the 'surround.' Characteristics: effects on neural responses=Electrophysiology studies Electrophysiology studies are used to characterize the surround suppression effect. Vision researchers that record neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) have seen that spike rates, or neural responses, can be suppressed in as many as 90% of neurons by stimuli outside of their surround. In these cells, the spike rates may be reduced by as much as 70%. Stimulus and attention dependence Suppression often increases with stimulus size beyond the classical receptive field. The suppressive effect is often dependent on the contrast, orientation, and direction of motion of the stimulus stimulating the surround. These properties are highly dependent on the brain area and the individual neuron being studied. In MT, for instance, cells can be sensitive to the direction and velocity of stimuli up to 50 to 100 times the area of their classical receptive fields. The statistical properties of the stimuli used to probe these neurons affect the properties of the surround as well. Because these areas are so highly interconnected, stimulation of one cell can affect the response properties of other cells, and therefore researchers have become increasingly aware of the choice of stimuli they use in these experiments. In addition to studies with simple stimuli (dots, bars, sinusoidal gratings), more recent studies have used more realistic stimuli (natural scenes) to study these effects. Stimuli that better represent natural scenes tend to induce higher levels of suppression, indicating this effect is tied closely to the properties of natural scenes such as textures and local context. Surround suppression is also modulated by attention. By training monkeys to attend to certain areas of their visual field, researchers have studied how directed attention can enhance the suppressive effects of stimuli surrounding the area of attention. Similar perceptual studies have been performed on human subjects as well. Systems involved Surround suppression was formally discovered in the visual pathway, and noticed first by Hubel and Wiesel while mapping receptive fields. The earliest parts of the visual pathway: the retina, Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN), and primary visual cortex (V1) are among the most well-studied. Surround suppression has been studied in later areas as well, including V2, V3, V4, and MT. Surround suppression has also been seen in sensory systems other than vision. One example in somatosensation is surround suppression in the barrel cortex of mice, in which bending one whisker can suppress the response of a neuron responding to a whisker nearby. It has even been seen in the frequency response properties of electoreception in electric fish. Biological mechanisms The biological mechanisms behind surround suppression are not known. The differences between lateral, feedforward, and recurrent connections Several theories have been proposed for the biological basis of this effect. Based on the diversity of the stimulus characteristics that cause this effect and the variety of responses that are generated, it seems that many mechanisms may be at play. Lateral connections Lateral connections are connections between neurons in the same layer. There are many of these connections in all areas of the visual system, which means that a neuron representing one piece of the visual field can influence a neuron representing another piece. Even within lateral connections, there are potentially different mechanisms at play. Monocular mechanisms, requiring stimulation in only one eye, may drive this effect with stimuli with high spatial frequency. When the stimulus frequency is lowered, however, binocular mechanisms come into play, where neurons from different eyes may suppress each other. Model based on this idea have been shown to reproduce surround suppressive effects. Recurrent feedback It has been posited that lateral connections are too slow and cover too little of the visual field to fully explain surround suppression. Feedback from higher areas may explain the discrepancies seen in mechanism for surround suppression based purely on lateral connections. There is evidence that inactivation of higher order areas results in reduced strength of surround suppression. At least one model of excitatory connections from higher levels has been formed in the effort to more fully explain surround suppression. However, recurrent feedback is difficult to determine using electrophysiology, and the potential mechanisms at play are not as well studied as feedforward or lateral connections. Advantages Surround suppression behavior (and its opposite) gives the sensory system several advantages from both a perceptual and information theory standpoint. Perceptual advantages Surround suppression likely participates in context-dependent perceptual tasks. Some specific tasks in which surround suppression may aid include: * Motion and velocity detection: In areas such as MT and even V1, the selectivity of neurons to the motion of contrasts may play a potential role in representing the structure of moving objects. * Contour integration: Detecting continuity of curved and/or 'broken' edges * Texture segregation * Perceptual constancies: Recognizing continuity in objects despite changes in lighting, color, or size. * Figure-ground segmentation: In this process, local contrast must be used to identify and assign borders. * Depth perception (through motion parallax) These tasks require the use of inputs over wide regions of visual space, meaning that independent responses to small parts of the visual field (a classical linear model of V1) would not be able to produce these effects. There is evidence that surround suppression participates in these tasks by either adjusting the representation of the classical receptive field or representing entirely different features that include both the classical receptive field and the surround. Direct comparison between physiology and psychophysical experiments have been done on several perceptual effects. These include: (1) the reduced apparent contrast of a grating texture embedded in a surrounding grating, (2) target identification when flanked by other features, (3) saliency of broken contours surrounded by edge segments of different orientations, and (4) orientation discrimination when surrounded by features of different orientations and spatial frequencies. Information theoretic advantages It has recently been shown that stimulation of the surround may support the efficient coding hypothesis proposed by Horace Barlow in 1961.Barlow, H. B. (1961). Possible principles underlying the transformation of sensory messages. Sensory communication, 217-234. This hypothesis suggests that the goal of the sensory system is to create an efficient representation of the stimulus. Recently, this has intersected with the idea of a 'sparse' code, one that is represented using the fewest units possible. It has been shown that surround suppression increases the efficiency of transmitting visual information, and may form a sparse code. If many cells respond to parts of the same stimulus, for instance, a lot of redundant information is encoded.Schwartz, O., & Simoncelli, E. (2001). Natural signal statistics and sensory gain control. Nature neuroscience 819–825. Retrieved from http://www.cns.nyu.edu/csh04/Articles/Schwartz-Simoncelli-01.pdf. The cell needs metabolic energy for each action potential it produces. Therefore, surround suppression likely helps to produce a neural code that is more metabolically efficient. There are additional theoretical advantages, including the removal of statistical redundancy inherent in natural scene statistics, as well as decorrelation of neural responses, which means less information to process later in the pathway. Related approaches in computer vision Edge detection based on center (red) and off center (green) receptive fields The goal of computer vision is to perform automated tasks similar to those of the human visual system, quickly and accurately interpreting the world and making decisions based on visual information. Because surround suppression seems to play a role in efficient and accurate perception, there have been a few computer vision algorithms inspired by this phenomenon in human vision: * Efficient image representation * Contour detection algorithm So far, the scientific community has been focused on the response properties of the neurons, but exploration of the relation to inference and learning has begun as well.

The purpose of the review was to consider and report on the future direction of the higher education sector and seek recommendations for reform and continuing improvement. The Review was conducted by an independent expert panel and was led by Emeritus Professor Denise Bradley AC. A discussion paper, \\"Review of Australian Higher Education,\\" was released in June 2008. The report was released on 17 December 2008 under the title \\"Transforming Australia’s Higher Education System\\" The report recommended: * high targets for participation in higher education, particularly amongst students from low socio-economic backgrounds * promoting diversity and quality through the second by allocating funding according to student demand * providing funding certainty in the sector * a massive upgrade of university and TAFE infrastructure * establishing the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA)to enhance quality and support accreditation * reforms to student income support * additional support to regional tertiary education provision * developing better pathways between the higher education and vocational education and training sectors Most significantly, perhaps, the Review recommended that Australia set a target that by 2020 40 per cent of 25- to 34-year-old Australians have a university degree. This has attracted a significant amount of media attention.Vin Massaro \\"Unpicking the Bradley Report\\", The Australian, 17 February 2009, http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/unpicking-the- bradley-report/story-e6frgcko-1111118880366 In the 2009 Budget, the Australian Government announced funds to support higher education and research over four years in a response to the Bradley Review, Transforming Australia’s Higher Education System. The purpose of the funds allocation was to \\"support high quality teaching and learning, improve access and outcomes for students from low socio-economic backgrounds, build new links between universities and disadvantaged schools, reward institutions for meeting agreed quality and equity outcomes, improve resourcing for research and invest in world class tertiary education infrastructure\\".

An English translation was made in 1923 by T. E. Lawrence (as J. H. Ross), but both French and English versions have since fallen into obscurity. The book was despised by Lawrence, who wrote the following while working on the translation: > At last this foul work: complete. Please have [it] typed and send [it] down > that I may get it off my suffering chest before I burst. Damn Adrien le > Corbeau and his rhetoric. The book is a magnificent idea, ruined by jejune > bombast. My version is better than his: but dishonest here and there: but my > stomach turned. Couldn't help it. A second English edition (1935) was illustrated with woodcuts by Agnes Miller Parker. French historian Maurice Larès wrote that, far from being a Francophobe as he is usually depicted in France, Lawrence was really a Francophile.Larès, Maurice \\"T.E. Lawrence and France: Friends or Foes?\\" pages 220-242 from The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 236. Larès wrote: \\"But we should note that a man rarely devotes much of his time and effort to the study of a language and of the literature of a people he hates, unless this is in order to work for its destruction (Eichmann's behavior may be an instance of this), which was clearly not Lawrence's case. Had Lawrence really disliked the French, would he, even for financial reasons, have translated French novels into English? The quality of his translation of Le Gigantesque (The Forest Giant) reveals not only his conscientiousness as an artist but also a knowledge of French that can scarcely have derived from unfriendly feelings\\".

He specialized in Romanesque revival architecture and worked with Joseph John Scoles. Life Ireland was born into a Catholic family from Crofton, near Wakefield. He worked almost entirely for Roman Catholic patrons, notably the Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District, John Milner. From 1812 until 1819, he employed Joseph John Scoles, a relative, as an apprentice. From 1816 to 1818, he was the architect of Church of All Saints, Hassop, originally built as a private chapel for Hassop Hall and its owner Francis Eyre.Derbyshire Heritage retrieved 5 February 2014 The design was based on Inigo Jones' St Paul's Covent Garden. In 1821, he built a Greek-style chapel beside Houghton Hall for Charles Langdale who had inherited the estate.'Langdale Family' from National Archives retrieved 5 February 2014 In 1824, he was behind the initial plans for St Austin's Church in Wakefield. In 1826, the plans came to fruition when the Society of Jesus set up a mission there and started the building work the following year.'Parish History' in StMartinsWakefield.org.uk retrieved 5 February 2014 For the next two years, he worked on St Peter and St Paul Church in Wolverhampton and a chapel for the Dominican Order in Hinckley. The priory in Hinckley was the centre for the Dominicans in Britain and the chapel was dedicated to St Peter. It was demolished in 1976.History of Hinckley retrieved 5 February 2014 Other works included Holy Cross Chapel in Leicester from 1817 to 1819, St Mary's Chapel in Walsall in 1825 and Saints Peter and Paul Chapel in Wolverhampton in 1826.Hinckley Architects retrieved 5 February 2014 In 1829 he built a chapel at Tixhall Hall, Staffordshire for the Clifford family; it was dismantled following the sale of the estate in 1840 and rebuilt as the church of John the Baptist at Great Haywood.
