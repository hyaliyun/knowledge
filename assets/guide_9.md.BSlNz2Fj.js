His date of birth is not known. Most of his life is scarcely documented. He studied with Jacomart, in whose studio he worked, and after a period of time Rexach succeeded his master. He completed some altarpieces left incomplete by Jacomart, and worked with him on certain commissions, so sometimes attributions can be difficult. Rexach opted for large formats and monumental treatment of the figures. Rexach was an eminent painter in Valencia during the 15th century. Although his works are markedly Spanish, they also reflect influences of other European artistic style, especially Flanders. His famous painting, The Crucifixion, resembles the work of Gerard David. The architecture shown in the painting is northern. His other famous work, Madonna and Child Enthroned, was in vogue to the point of becoming a motif in Valencian art of his time. These two paintings were part of a larger retable. Among his works are the following altarpieces: * The Santa Ursula, from Cubells, now in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (National Art Museum of Catalonia). Signature appears at the feet of the saint * The Epiphany, from the Augustinian convent in Rubielos de Mora, also in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya * The San Martin, Segorbe Cathedral * The Crucifixion and the Virgin enthroned with Angels, in the Norton Simon Museum * The Annunciation, a diptych (118x110 cm each table) dated circa 1460, now in the Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts St. Martin of Tours, a retable by Juan Rexach, Segorbe Cathedral Museum References * Azc√°rate Ristori, J.

She is known for her role as one of the organizers of the logging blockades in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia in 1992-93\\\\. In 2009, Berman served on British Columbia's Green Energy Task Force. The task force, appointed by Premier Gordon Campbell, was charged with making recommendations on the development of renewable energy for the province. Berman was one of the experts in the environmental documentary The 11th Hour, produced by Leonardo DiCaprio. She was named as one of six Canadian nominees for the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship social entrepreneur of the year award, one of \\"50 Visionaries Changing the World\\" in Utne Reader and as \\"Canada's Queen of Green\\" in a cover story by Readers Digest. She was included in the Royal British Columbia Museum permanent exhibit of \\"150 people who have changed the face of British Columbia.\\" In 2015 Berman served on the British Columbia Governments Climate Leadership Team and was appointed in 2016 to serve on the Alberta Governments Oil Sands Advisory Group as Co-Chair. Berman was listed of one of the 35 Most Influential Women in British Columbia by BC Business Magazine and awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Law from University of British Columbia. Berman is an Adjunct Professor at the Faculty of Environmental Studies, at York University in Toronto. She was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Law from the University of British Columbia. Early life and education Berman grew up in London, Ontario, the third of four siblings in a middle-class Jewish family. Her father owned a small advertising company and her mother had a business that made promotional flags and pennants.Glave, James (November 1, 2009). \\"Tzeporah Berman's Green Idea.\\" Vancouver Magazine. Retrieved: 2013-08-06. The family spent summers at her mother's family's cottage in Lake of the Woods. Her father died when Berman was in her early teens and her mother died two years later. After high school, Berman moved to Toronto to attend Ryerson University's fashion arts design program. While she was successful in design‚ÄîHarry Rosen, who judged the school's final show called her a \\"bright light on Canada's fashion scene\\"‚Äîshe found a new calling and switched to environmental studies at York University. Career and research In 1992, Berman travelled to the Carmanah Valley on Vancouver Island to do fieldwork on threatened seabirds. The following year when she returned to continue her survey, she found that a logging crew had clear-cut the hillside. In 1993, the Clayoquot Sound Land Use Decision had granted pulp-and-paper giant MacMillan Bloedel rights to clear cut two thirds of a 650,000 acre lowland coastal temperate rainforest, the largest of its kind in the world. Berman joined with Valerie Langer and members of Friends of Clayoquot Sound in the growing Clayoquot protests. That summer, Friends of Clayoquot Sound and Greenpeace launched blockades against the logging. Berman came to national and international attention as one of the spokespersons for the protests, which employed nonviolent civil disobedience tactics taught in a series of peace camps in Tofino and in high-profile locations such as Stanley Park in Vancouver.Berman, Tzeporah, with Mark Leiren-Young. (2011). This Crazy Time: Living our environmental challenge. Toronto: Alfred A. Knopf Canada. Saunders, Doug (May 24, 2011). \\"Greenpeace: tactics not so clear cut anymore.\\" The Globe and Mail. Retrieved: 2013-08-06. The blockades lasted for five months and became the largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history; over 850 people were arrested.The Canadian Encyclopedia. Clayoquot Sound. Historica Dominion. Retrieved on: 2012-11-08. right Berman played a key role in the negotiations between MacMillan Bloedel (now owned by Weyerhaeuser), the activists and local First Nations. MacMillan Bloedel agreed to hand over its logging rights in Clayoquot Sound to Indigenous-controlled companies who would keep the old-growth forests intact. By the late 1990s, Greenpeace had been successful in Europe using ad campaigns against companies engaging in practices considered damaging to the environment. In 2000, Berman co-founded ForestEthics, a group devoted to using tactics that would convince companies to change their ways or risk loss of sales. One of Berman's first successful actions was the Victoria's Secret campaign. The company had been printing a million copies per day of its glossy catalogues using paper from old-growth timber. The ForestEthics campaign initiated street-theatre demonstrations and fake fashion ads to force the undergarment manufacturer to consider changing its practices. After a few weeks, Berman was able to negotiate different wood- pulp sources with company management. Similar campaigns targeting Staples and Office Depot led them to reconsider using old-growth timber. The strategy was not just to tell companies what they should stop doing, but rather \\"what they should continue doing and start doing in order to stay in business but avoid protests.\\" Berman went on to be one of the lead negotiators in the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement. In 2004, Berman switched her focus to climate change, founding a nonprofit environmental organization called PowerUp Canada that worked successfully to create greater support in Canada for carbon pricing and defended the BC carbon tax from critics threatening to \\"axe the tax.\\" In 2010 Berman was hired to Co-Direct Greenpeace International's Climate and Energy program in 40 countries. In that capacity she was the team leader for the creation of the Arctic campaign, contributed to the campaign to get Volkswagen to support vehicle efficiency regulations in the EU and ran a successful campaign against Facebook, on Facebook, to encourage the company to demand renewable energy in its procurement for data centers. Before leaving Greenpeace she helped to design and coordinate the \\"Clean Our Cloud\\" campaign that encouraged the largest IT companies in the world such as Apple and Google to demand and invest in renewable energy. In 2012, Berman moved back to Canada and began consulting with philanthropic foundations, environmental organizations and First Nations on climate and energy policy and to design campaigns on oil sands and pipelines. In 2015 Berman was appointed by the British Columbia Government to the Climate Leadership Team to make recommendations on climate policy in British Columbia. In 2016, she was appointed to be Co-Chair of the Oil Sands Advisory Group by the Alberta Government to make recommendations on implementing the new Climate Leadership Plan, reviewing cumulative impacts of oil sands operations and design climate recommendations for the pathway to 2050. In 2018, Berman came on board with Stand.earth, formerly ForestEthics, as International Program Director. Selected works =Books= * Berman, Tzeporah, with Mark Leiren-Young. (2011).

This has been demonstrated in various pilot projects in South Asia and Africa. Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%. Transport, if analyzed for the cost‚Äìbenefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3‚Äì10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.

Its main software products include SMS, GMS, WMS, and Arc Hydro Groundwater. History The Engineering Computer Graphics Laboratory (ECGL) was established in 1985 at Brigham Young University (BYU). Simulation data produced in the lab was critical to Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., a 1986 federal lawsuit concerning toxic contamination of groundwater in Woburn, Massachusetts. After using another BYU product‚ÄîMovie BYU‚Äîto animate a hydrology problem to make it easier to understand, Norm Jones decided to start work on software that helped engineers visualize problems and solutions. Use of the tools created by Jones allowed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to save \\"hundreds of thousands of dollars.\\" Alan Zundel and James Nelson, two other professors at BYU, also became involved in the process of developing the software in 1991. By 2002, the company's software was being used in \\"more than 100 countries and [by] more than 9,000 organizations.\\" Royd Nelson created Environmental Modeling Systems (EMSI), a private company, in October 1995 to distribute the software created in the ECGL. The name of the lab was changed in September 1998 to the Environmental Modeling Research Laboratory (EMRL). The government of India used early versions of the software developed by the EMRL to help with finding sources of clean groundwater, setting groundwater policy, and setting a course of action to clean up the contaminated groundwater in their country. State and local governments in Utah and California have used the software to help trace contaminant sources at farms and mining facilities, and to determine how to manage water resources in drier climates like the Los Angeles area. The planners of the 2002 Winter Olympics, held in Salt Lake City, Utah, used the Watershed Modeling System (WMS) software to simulate terrorist attacks on water infrastructure such as the Jordanelle Reservoir. In April 2007, a private company named Aquaveo was created to develop the work of the EMRL as commercial products, and the main people at the lab moved to the new company. EMSI and Aquaveo merged in October 2008, keeping the company name of \\"Aquaveo\\". Local and federal government agencies, including the US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Federal Highway Administration, Los Angeles County, the USGS, the US Department of Energy, and the USEPA, have software and consulting contracts with Aquaveo. In 2011, the government of Australia used Arc Hydro Groundwater to help in developing a national groundwater information system. Arc Hydro was used to convert bore and construction log data and to create geovolumes from georasters. Aquaveo worked with the Office of Naval Research, the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, and several universities and companies to create the Environmental and Ship Motion Forecasting system. This system was designed to \\"provide sea-based forces with new capabilities for difficult operations like ship-to-ship transfer of personnel, vehicles or material-giving operators sea condition information at levels of accuracy never possible before.\\" Products Aquaveo is primarily a software development company for water modeling that allow water to be modeled in most situations: watershed, rivers, lakes, ocean tides, flooding, and so on. Its flagship products are SMS and GMS, which are used by municipalities and universities around the world. It also produces WMS and Arc Hydro Groundwater. Their software is used by \\"over 12,000 firms, government institutions, and universities in over 120 countries\\". =Arc Hydro Groundwater= Arc Hydro Groundwater allows for managing groundwater and subsurface data within ArcGIS.

It consists of 13 row houses from #651 to the east to #675 to the west, which were built in 1899-90 and designed by J. Mason Kirby in a combination of the Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival styles. Kirby, a former Philadelphian who had previous designed Lucy the Elephant in Margate, New Jersey and a 122-foot- high elephant in Coney Island, which was destroyed by fire in 1896, designed the row houses on Park Place for Frederick W. and Walter S. Hammett, two brothers from Philadelphia; the land had previously been partially owned by their father, Barnabas Hammett, a Pennsylvania coal industry pioneer. Although all the houses were originally single-family residences, during the Depression many owners took in boarders, and by the beginning of the 1960s some of the houses had been converted into multiple-family dwellings. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the row a historic district on June 26, 2012. According to the designation report, > The houses are of three types, arranged in a symmetrical configuration, and > feature brick facades with rough-faced brownstone trim.

Retrieved 15 January 2017. is a former postman who started his professional career with Royal Mail. From 2012 to 2015, he was the Serjeant at Arms of the British House of Commons and as such was responsible for its access and maintaining order. Early life Ward was born in London in 1968. He left school at 15 to work in an electronics company. At 16, he joined the two-year Youth Training Scheme as a postal cadet at the Royal Mail. Career Ward following graduation from the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme in 2012 Ward carrying the mace into the House of Commons, 2012 At 18, he joined the management programme of Royal Mail, and became a supervisor. In 1997, having progressed his career to Senior Management, Ward was appointed the 18th postmaster for the House of Commons. His responsibilities as Postmaster included overseeing postal services to Downing Street and managing the Court Postmaster at the Royal Household. His contribution to managing what was described by John Roberts, Royal Mail's CEO, as \\"the Crown Jewels of the Post Office's contracts\\" won him the national Commercial Manager of the Year award in 2001. Following the anthrax attacks delivered via the mail in the US, he led the development of pan-government mail screening services. Working with security agencies both in the UK and the US, he introduced advanced processes and technologies for the screening of mail across Whitehall. With a developing expertise in security, he was asked to take on a permanent position at Parliament in 2006 managing its contract with the Metropolitan Police Service. He was appointed Assistant Serjeant at Arms in 2008 with responsibility for the operation of the Chamber and Commons Committees. During a heated debate on building a third runway at Heathrow airport in January 2009, John McDonnell MP, grabbed the Mace and attempted to proceed with it from the Chamber. McDonnell later said \\"they stopped me before I got out of the Chamber and I wasn't going to struggle with someone wearing a huge sword on their hip‚Äù. Ward received a letter from the Speaker that recognised the dignified manner with which the incident had been resolved. Throughout the early 2000s, the UK Youth Parliament had sought to hold their annual debate in the House of Commons Chamber, and this was contentious as some MPs and officials disliked the idea of the Commons Chamber being used for that purpose. The initiative was supported by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Speaker John Bercow and a vote to allow its use for the debate saw 189 MPs voting in favour, with 16 votes against. Ward told the BBC that he supported the initiative and had personally volunteered to lead the planning of the inaugural sitting. On Friday 30 October 2009, the debate took place, representing the first time the House of Commons Chamber had been used by a group other than MPs. As Assistant Serjeant, Ward was responsible for some administration of State visits by the President of the United States, Barack Obama, and Pope Benedict XVI. He was cited on the front pages of The Times and The Guardian in 2011 when he hand delivered the summons' for Rupert Murdoch and James Murdoch to appear at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee to answer questions relating to the News International phone hacking scandal.\\"The Guardian ‚Äì Phone Hacking: both Murdoch's agree to appear at Committee\\" In November 2011, he was appointed acting Deputy Serjeant at Arms. On 1 May 2012, Queen Elizabeth II appointed him the 40th Serjeant at Arms of the British House of Commons. In March 2013, Ward oversaw the arrest of Eric Joyce MP following a brawl at a bar in the House of Commons.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/15/eric-joyce-arrest-mp- police Two months later, Ward was again involved in an historic event when he approved and supervised the searching of a Member‚Äôs office by Lancashire Police. The Deputy Speaker, Nigel Evans, had been arrested following allegations, later disproved, of rape and sexual assault. Working with the Speaker, and seeking advice from the Attorney and Solicitors‚Äô General, he ensured lessons had been learned from when Damien Green‚Äôs office had been similarly searched in 2009. Specifically, legal safeguards, including a search warrant, were in place prior to the commencement of the search. Ward was an advocate of greater accessibility to the House of Commons and was the Senior Responsible Officer for the development of Parliament's education centre on Victoria Tower Gardens. He narrated a number of educational videos to promote accessibility to, and procedural understanding of, the House of Commons Chamber. He lobbied Committees to liberalise filming regulations and this led to documentary maker Michael Cockerell being given unprecedented access to film the BBC's Inside the Commons series. The first feature film to be made within the precincts of Parliament soon followed when Suffragette was filmed there in 2014.\\"Serjeant for the Commons\\" \\"House of Commons Library\\" His work on public engagement led to him being awarded House Officer of the Year in 2015 at the Asian Voice Political and Public Life Awards. He announced his intention to stand down on 20 September 2015 and tributes were paid to him on the floor of the House, led by the Speaker, the Leader and Shadow Leader of the House, on 17 September 2015. He described his time in the role in interviews with the BBC's Daily Politics and Radio 4's The Westminster Hour, During his tenure responsibility for security was removed from this post after 600 years. Since September 2015 he has reportedly worked in the private sector as the Global Head of Security for an international consultancy and technology company.

Officially classified as a multi- purpose operation destroyer, she is the lead ship in the of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). She is the second warship to be named for Izumo Province, with the previous ship being the armoured cruiser (1898). The ruling Liberal Democrat Party announced in May 2018 that it favours converting Izumo to operate fixed-wing aircraft. The conversion was confirmed in December 2018 when Japan announced the change of its defense guidelines. Upon the completion of the process, Izumo will be the first Japanese aircraft carrier since World War II. Design and construction JS Izumo The construction of the first ship of the class began in 2011 at an IHI Marine United shipyard in Yokohama, with funding totalling 113.9 billion yen ($1.5 billion) being set aside in the fiscal 2010 budget for this purpose. The destroyers of this class were initially intended to replace the two ships of the , which were originally scheduled to begin decommissioning in FY2014. The ship, the largest Japanese naval vessel since World War II, was laid down on 27 January 2012 and launched on 6 August 2013. The ship began sea trials on 29 September 2014. The ship was commissioned on 25 March 2015. The ship is as large as a Japanese carrier of Second World War-era. Izumo is called a destroyer because the Japanese constitution forbids the acquisition of offensive weapons but the vessel allows Japan to project military power well beyond its territorial waters. Characteristics =Aircraft carried= The ship can carry up to 28 aircraft, or 14 larger aircraft. Only seven ASW helicopters and two SAR helicopters are planned for the initial aircraft complement. For other operations, 400 troops and 50 3.5-ton trucks (or equivalent equipment) can also be carried. The flight deck has five helicopter landing spots that allow simultaneous landings and take-offs. In 2010, Forecast International reported that some design features were intended to support fixed-wing aircraft such as the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II; although neither the Ministry of Defense nor the JMSDF have mentioned the possibility of introducing fixed-wing aircraft. The ship has neither a \\"ski-jump\\" nor a catapult, typical features for launching fixed-wing aircraft.Holm, Erik. \\"Japan launches biggest warship since WW2\\" (in Danish). Ingeni√∏ren, 12 August 2013. Accessed: 12 August 2013. If Izumo-class ships were to operate fixed- wing aircraft, they would be limited to STOVL (short take-off, vertical landing) aircraft. Japan has purchased the conventional version of the Lightning II (the F-35A) but may buy the STOVL version (the F-35B) which could be operated from a modified Izumo-class ship.Does the Izumo Represent Japan Crossing the \\"Offensive\\" Rubicon? Newpacificinstitute.com, 13 August 2013. In December 2018, it was announced that the Japanese government would change its defense guidelines and purchase about 40 F-35B to operate them from both Izumo and her sister ship . =Air-defense= The ship is equipped with three Phalanx CIWS and two SeaRAM for her defense. Operational history Izumo became operational in time to take part in a major August 2015 disaster drill conducted in Tokyo, alongside the Japan Coast Guard's large patrol vessel Izu. The two vessels acted as casualty receiving and triage stations during the exercise. In May 2017 Izumo was deployed to escort , a US supply vessel, to the area off Shikoku. Richard E. Byrds mission was to refuel another US warship that was defending against North Korean missiles. This was the first time a Japanese vessel was deployed to escort a US ship since security legislation was enacted in March 2016. A small protest took place at Yokosuka after Izumos departure. The destroyer also joined the mission. In 2020, Izumo began her conversion to operate the F-35B fighter aircraft.https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/japan-begins- refitting-first-of-two-izumo-class-carriers-to-support-f-35b-operations References  External links  * Category:Izumo-class helicopter destroyers Category:Helicopter carriers Category:2013 ships Category:Ships built in Japan Category:IHI Corporation ","title":"JS Izumo"},{"id":"40171513","text":"Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District, 570 U.S. 595 (2013), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that land-use agencies imposing conditions on the issuance of development permits must comply with the \\"nexus\\" and \\"rough proportionality\\" standards of Nollan v. California Coastal Commission and Dolan v. City of Tigard, even if the condition consists of a requirement to pay money, and even if the permit is denied for failure to agree to the condition.Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., . It was the first case in which monetary exactions were found to be unconstitutional conditions.  Background  Petitioner Coy Koontz applied to the St. Johns River Water Management District for a permit to develop 3.7 acres of wetlands under the District's jurisdiction.Eric D. Hageman, Case Comment, The Factual Reality of Koontz v. St. Johns, 90 Notre Dame L. Rev. Online 54 (2015). Koontz offered to mitigate the loss of wetlands by conveying to the District a conservation easement over 11 acres of adjacent land. The District declined Koontz's mitigation offer, instead proposing that Koontz either reduce the size of his development to one acre, or pay for improvements to unrelated property owned by the District several miles away. Koontz responded by filing suit against the District in state court.Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., No. 11-1447, slip op. at 2-4. Following an initial dismissal, appeal, and remand, the Florida Circuit Court ruled that the District's demand for offsite mitigation violated Nollan v. California Coastal Commission and Dolan v. City of Tigard, since the improvements to the District's property lacked either an essential nexus or rough proportionality to the environmental impact of Koontz's proposed development. The state appellate court affirmed, but the Supreme Court of Florida reversed, holding that Nollan and Dolan did not apply because (1) Koontz's permit was denied, rather than granted subject to the unconstitutional condition, and (2) the District sought money rather than a conveyance of real property as a condition to issuing the permit. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine the applicability of Nollan and Dolan under these circumstances.Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., . Koontz was represented by Paul J. Beard, II, of the Pacific Legal Foundation. Amicus briefs in support of Koontz were filed by the American Civil Rights Union, the National Association of Home Builders, the National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Legal Center, and six other parties.Supreme Court Docket, Case No. 11-1147. (https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/11-1447.htm) The St. Johns River Water Management District was represented by Paul R. Q. Wolfson. Amicus briefs in support of the District were filed by the Solicitor General of the United States, the American Planning Association, the National Governors Association, and other public entities and officials. Deputy General Edwin Kneedler argued for the United States as amicus curiae in support of the District.  Opinion of the Court  Writing for the Court, Justice Alito held that conditions imposed upon the issuance of a land-use permit must conform to the requirements of Nollan and, if applicable, Dolan even when the permit is denied for failure to comply with the conditions. The unconstitutional conditions doctrine forbids governments from ‚Äúpressuring someone into forfeiting a constitutional right‚Äù by ‚Äúcoercively withholding benefits‚Äù.Koontz, 133 S. Ct. at 2595. Nollan and Dolan ‚Äúinvolve a special application‚Äù of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to the Fifth Amendment right to just compensation.133 S. Ct. at 2594, quoting Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. A government cannot, therefore, coerce someone applying for a permit to give away her property regardless of if the permit is approved after a successful threat or denied after a failed threat. Because both demand an unconstitutional condition, both are forbidden. However, the constitution only requires just compensation after a takings, and because Koontz sued under state law instead of allowing his property to be taken, the Court remands to determine if Florida law provides money damages for an unconstitutional conditions violation. Nollan and Dolan also apply when, as here, the challenged condition amounts to a requirement to pay money, rather than to give up an easement over the property. The Florida Supreme Court had also held that if a government demands money instead of real estate there can be no takings. Alito observes that under this logic the Nollan and Dolan requirements ‚Äúwould be very easy‚Äù to avoid, especially since such development impact fees are already ‚Äúutterly commonplace‚Äù.133 S. Ct. at 2599 citing Rosenberg, The Changing Culture of American Land Use Regulation: Paying for Growth with Impact Fees, 59 S.M.U. L.Rev. 177, 202-203 (2006) The takings clause applies because the government‚Äôs demand for money here was directly linked to a specific parcel of real property, as distinguished from the benefits in Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel. While Alito cannot explain why such monetary exactions are not merely a tax, he believes that ‚Äúteasing out the difference between taxes and takings is more difficult in theory than in practice.‚Äù The Court‚Äôs long-settled view is that takings require just compensation even if they are functionally similar to a tax and Alito sees no need to define the difference here. Finally, Alito dismisses Kagan‚Äôs fear of disrupting local governments because courts in Texas, Illinois, and Ohio have already been applying Nollan and Dolan to monetary exactions. =Dissenting opinion= Justice Kagan dissented, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. The dissent agreed that Nollan and Dolan apply when a land-use permit is denied for failure to comply with a condition, but argued that those standards should not apply when the agency conditions a permit on the payment of money, rather than a conveyance of land. Kagan criticizes the comprehensiveness of the Alito‚Äôs analysis, stating that the majority is adopting ‚Äúa prophylaxis in search of a problem‚Äù. She then faults the majority for deciding too little, openly wondering if the majority would agree with those states that apply higher scrutiny to adjudicative decisions than legislative decisions.133 S. Ct. 2586 at 2608 (Kagan, dissenting) citing Ehrlich v. City of Culver City, 911 P.2d 429, 12 Cal. 4th 854, 50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 242 (1996). Believing that the Court will ‚Äúrue the day‚Äù that it discouraged local governments from negotiating with developers, Kagan writes ‚Äúthe majority turns a broad array of local land use-regulations into federal constitutional questions.‚Äù The dissenting justices also maintained that, on the facts of this case, the District never actually demanded anything in exchange for a permit, and no regulatory taking took place because no property changed hands. Reactions On remand the Florida Supreme Court remanded to the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal, which simply readopted its 2009 decision awarding Koontz money damages.St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist. v. Koontz, No. 5D06-1116 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. Apr. 30, 2014). The ruling was unpopular with some legal academicsJohn D. Echeverria, Koontz: The Very Worst Takings Decision Ever, 22 N.Y.U. Environmental Law Journal 1 (2014). but lauded by others.Illya Somin, Two Steps Forward for the \\"Poor Relation\\" of Constitutional Law: Koontz, Arkansas Game & Fish, and the Future of the Takings Clause, 2012 Cato Sup. Ct. Review 215 (2013). Commentators encouraged localities to start denying permits without discussionSean Nolon, Bargaining for Development Post-Koontz: How the Supreme Court Invaded Local Government, 67 Florida Law Review 171 (2015). but predicted that only \\"strong judicial action\\" will effect entrenched players.Steven Eagle, Koontz in the Mansion and the Gatehouse, 46 The Urban Lawyer 1 (2014). While Koontz leaves ‚Äúexactions and takings jurisprudence in a confused and unsustainable state‚Äù, scholars believe it may encourage localities to adopt more alienable and standardized fee schedules or it may even lead to the eventual collapse of Nollan and Dolan exactions into the Due Process Clause.Lee Fennel and Eduardo Pe√±alver, Exactions Creep, 2013 Supreme Court Review 287 (2014).

Biography He was in business in his native town, but had to leave the place on account of persecution by Manuel Lozada, a caudillo, who became a kind of independent ruler in the Tepic territory. Corona joined the liberals, entered the army, soon obtained the rank of general, and fought against the army of Maximilian, especially in the western states, and the French troops never became masters of that part of the country. Corona organized the Army of the west, 8,000 strong, in 1866, and crossed the country, defeating the French in many encounters. He reached Quer√©taro, participated in the siege, and, after the final victory of the Mexicans, Maximilian surrendered to him on 15 May 1867. The republic having been reinstated, President Benito Ju√°rez gave Corona a high military office, with residence at Guadalajara. At that time Lozada, thinking to subjugate the whole nation, organized an army of 16,000 men, and issued a proclamation to his troops, telling them to expect no compensation but what they could get from the vanquished towns. On 28 January 1872, at daybreak, began a bloody battle, near Mojonera, between his forces and about 1,400 men under Corona. Lozada was routed, leaving over 3,000 dead on the field, while the rest of his troops dispersed. Next day Corona entered Guadalajara in triumph, after having saved that city from the army of plunderers, for which he was given the title of \\"Hero de la Mojonera.\\" President Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada appointed him minister to Spain, where he remained twelve years. He returned to Mexico in 1884, and was put in command of the Federal army at Jalisco.

History A plan showing the known buildings of Nottingham Carmelite Friary (Nottingham Whitefriars). The Old Market Square is at the bottom of this image. The friary was reputedly founded by Reginald de Grey, 1st Baron Grey de Wilton, and Sir John Shirley around 1276, but this has been found to be incorrect. The foundation of the friary is unlikely as, \\"all the foundation that was permissible for a friary of the Mendicant orders (to which the Carmelites belong) was the gift of a site\\". The date is also implausible as in 1272 (four years before the reputed date) the friary was given 10 oaks to repair their church by King Henry III. The friary was in fact founded sometime before 1271. The land the priory was built on may have, however, been gifted by Reginald de Grey. The Royal Confirmation Charter given by King Edward II in 1319 records the donation of two plots of land by de Grey. The two plots were adjacent: one \\"in the French borough of Nottingham and the other in St. James's Lane\\". The friary is thought to have been held in the townspeople's affections as the friary site was extended with numerous donations of land and tenements adjacent to it. These donations were made by: Henry and Agnes Curtyse, William and Claricia de Chesterfield (and their sons and daughters), William and Agnes de Crophill, William de Lonnesdale, Ralph de Lokynton, William de Mekesburgh, Thomas de Radford, Nicholas de Shelford, William de Strelley, John de Thorneton, Cecilia de Ufton, Robert de Ufton, William de Watton, John de Wymondswold, Robert le Carter, William le Chaundeler, John le Collier, Ranulph le Leper, John and Sarah le Netherd, Alice le Palmere, Henry Putrel. Their precinct was extended again in October 1319, following the donation of a 80ft by 60ft parcel of land, by Hugh de Bingham. Edward II was very fond of the friary. In his Royal Confirmation Charter, he granted the friars freedom from the 5s. 6d. rent they owed to the crown, \\"on account of the special affection that we have and bear to the said prior and brethren.\\" In 1316, whilst visiting Clipston, Nottinghamshire, King Edward had given the friary the Chapel of Saint James, which had formerly belonged to Lenton Priory, and which was adjacent to their friary. In October 1393, after killing his wife Alice, Henry de Whitley sought sanctuary within the friary. As long he stayed within the church, he could not be arrested for his crimes; his property (valued at 11s. 2¬Ωd) was, however, seized by the Nottingham town authorities. The friary was home to two notable friars during the 14th century. Philip Baston of Nottingham (d.1320) \\"studied Philosophy and Divinity at Oxford and became a famous poet and orator\\". John Clipston of Nottingham (d. 1378) was a \\"Doctor and Professor of Divinity at Cambridge\\". He was reputed for his teachings and writings, and was buried within the friary at Nottingham. The friary was visited by King Henry VIII in August 1511. \\"He made an offering at the Rood of the White Friars\\". In 1532 the prior, Richard Sherwood, killed one of his friars, William Bacon, during a fight which broke out after they had been drinking. Sherwood hit Bacon on 21 February 1532, and Bacon died the following day. Sherwood was, however, pardoned for the killing by King Henry VIII, on 10 May 1532. The friary was dissolved as part of Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. It was surrendered by Prior Roger Cappe on 5 February 1539. The friary was, at the time, home to six friars: William Cooke, William Frost, John Roberts, William Smithson, William Thorpe, Robert Wilson. The friary site was granted, in 1541, to James Sturley of Nottingham. =List of Priors= *Robert, occurs 1379 *Robert Sutton, B.D., occurs 1442 *John Mott, occurs 1482 *Thomas Gregg, occurs 1495/96 *Thomas Smithson, occurs 1513 *Richard Sherwood, occurs 1532 *Roger Cappe, surrendered the friary in 1539 Location and remains Nothing remains of the former friary. It stood near to the south-west corner of Old Market Square; the priory precinct occupying the area between Friar Lane and St James Street. The area has been heavily developed since the dissolution and the site has been \\"almost solidly built over\\". It is remembered locally in the street name: \\"Friar Lane\\".Friar Lane, Nottingham, NG1 6BS In 1923, during work to widen Friar Lane, part of the former friary was uncovered in the south-west corner of Old Market Square. Most of the priory remains (around two-thirds) lay on the land which had been acquired by the Corporation of Nottingham for the street widening. This portion was not excavated or recorded, as the new road was laid over the top almost immediately. The land which contained the eastern portion of the ruins was to be used for construction. This allowed time for the few remains to be documented while the new foundations were dug. Adjacent to Friars Row, the remains were of a rectangular building of unknown function, with walls averaging thick. Aligned east-west, the building had encaustic tile floors. Also found was a thick section of the former precinct wall, and several skeletons.

The song was written and produced by Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen, with additional songwriting provided by Ferreira and Daniel Nigro. It was released as the album's lead single on September 24, 2013 by Capitol Records. The song was well-received by critics, who cited it as a standout track from its parent album and praised its overall sound. Grant Singer directed a music video for the track, which was released in September 2013. The song has been performed by Ferreira on several live events, some of which were television shows. Background \\"You're Not the One\\" was written in 2012, at a time when‚Äîaccording to Ferreira‚Äîshe \\"was in a different headspace\\". \\"I had been dating someone for three years, since I was 17, and that person guarded me from everything\\", she said. Ferreira explained that her life was essentially limited to modelling, crafting songs and \\"watch[ing] TV\\", which resulted in her not having a \\"chance to discover [her]self.\\" The track was recorded in 2013 by Ariel Rechtshaid, at the Heavy Duty Studios in Los Angeles. Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen produced the track, contributed towards its instrumentation and provided background vocals for the song. The two played the keyboard while they were accompanied by Daniel Nigro when playing the electric guitar; Rechtshaid played the bass and Garrett Ray helmed the drums. During post-production, David Schiffman mixed the song and Emily Lazar mastered it. During a July 2013 interview with Glamour, Ferreira announced that the track would serve as the lead single from an upcoming extended play‚Äîwhich ultimately became her debut album Night Time, My Time. The single cover for \\"You're Not the One\\" was revealed on September 9, 2013, and the song itself was released 15 days later, on September 24. An official remix of the track by producer Cid Rim was released online in March 2014; a commercial release of that remix, packaged with three others in a digital EP format, followed in June. In 2015, the Blood Diamonds remix of the song was featured in the commercial for Jimmy Choo's fragrance Illicit. Composition While recording the song, Ferreira was inspired by the works of David Bowie \\"You're Not the One\\" displays a fusion of pop and indie rock styles while incorporating electropop as well. Ferreira stated that she conceptualized the track as a \\"super-poppy version\\" of David Bowie's eleventh studio album Low (1977); she was told that the song itself resembles the works of singer- songwriter Siouxsie Sioux. Its instrumentation is marked by the mixture of pounding, \\"crude\\" percussion and electric guitar riffs, accompanied with \\"tinny six-stringer scrapes\\". Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club described its sonority as having \\"gothic overtones\\" and being a \\"homage\\" to the \\"late-80s\\" works of band The Cure. The songs' lyrics were written by Ferreira, Rechtshaid, Raisen and Nigro; they depict a relationship in which two love partners do not express sufficient mutual interest, due to the fact that they do not pursue each other. The Washington Posts Lavanya Ramanathan dubbed the song a \\"breakup tune\\" and wrote that in it, Ferreira embodies a teenager with \\"guy problems\\". For CMJ, Brooke Segarra billed the track as a \\"sexually assertive\\" number and interpreted the song's lyrical theme as listing the \\"mistakes and shortcomings\\" that come \\"with sex\\". Elias Leight of PopMatters wrote that a recurring theme in the album‚Äîalso represented in \\"You're Not the One\\"‚Äîis Ferreira's \\"rejection of the opposite sex\\". The song's official remix, produced by Cid Rim, removes the \\"pop rock\\" edge of the song in favor of an electronica and hip hop-influenced sound. In this version, the verses display handclaps underneath Ferreira's vocals, which are more pitched than in the original and \\"cut up\\" as well. Carl Williott of Idolator billed it as \\"an intriguing listen\\". Critical reception \\"You're Not the One\\" received positive feedback from contemporary music critics. Heather Phares of AllMusic selected the song as one of Night Time, My Times stronger tracks, as did Digital Spy's Lewis Corner; the latter elaborated that it \\"continues the premise that [Ferreira] has finally emerged as an artist who knows what she wants\\". Bryant Kitching from Consequence of Sound deemed it a musical highlight from the album. Comparing the song's guitar-led opening to \\"Johnny Marr on a sugar rush\\", he also called it the album's \\"most rewarding moment\\". Writing for magazine Spin, Marc Hogan echoed praise for the song‚Äîhe described it as \\"impressively catchy and emotionally communicative\\" and also said it was \\"the type of track that might inspire a label to green-light‚Äîfinally‚Äîher debut album\\". musicOMH's Nina Bertok highlighted the song's mixture of genres and catchiness, and also praised the \\"killer\\" chorus. The staff of The Guardian listed \\"You're Not the One\\" as the eighteenth best track of 2013, whereas Melissa Locker of Time, who made a similar list, included the song as the nineteenth best of that year. Music video The official music video for \\"You're Not the One\\" was directed by Grant Singer, and written and co-produced by V magazine senior editor Patrik Sandberg. Ferreira announced plans to shoot a visual for the track in July 2013, and stated that Singer would direct it. According to Singer, the video took nine months to craft; it was originally supposed to be filmed in Berlin so it had a \\"Christiane F. vibe\\", however this did not occur due to unknown reasons. Sandberg suggested the twist ending and the use of an ice pick, which he thought should be used as a \\"narrative tool\\" instead of just a prop. Singer described the overall video as \\"sinister and pop\\". The video was filmed at The Lash, a nightclub in Los Angeles, where Ferreira is seen dancing in front of multicolored lasers. The video, especially the opening sequence, is direct homage to the 1983 movie \\"The Hunger\\" starring David Bowie, and follows the same color and light choices, camera angles, and general storytelling of the movie's opening scene. The video begins with Ferreira walking towards a blue projector screen, wearing black sunglasses, a black jacket and a transparent, fishnet-pattern top. Ferreira stops and removes the jacket slowly as a group of voyeurs observes her. During her act, she continuously looks towards a man with shades and long hair, who sips a drink while watching Ferreira. Outside the nightclub, she is seen again with that man‚Äîher apparent love interest‚Äîas they kiss each other and involve themselves physically. They reencounter in a black room where Ferreira sticks an ice pick on his face; in response, he slaps her, to which she smiles and they start kissing again. After they reenter the nightclub, another man whispers in her ear, while this catches her love interest's attention, implying jealousy if not competition. The latter walks away and finds the woman he arrived with whom he starts dancing and kissing, much to Ferreira's sadness. The next morning, she wakes up in a grass field with red marks on her face while holding the ice pick, which is now covered in blood. In a different setting, the man, who is lying on a bed, sees his stomach cut with the word \\"not\\", dripping blood as well. Spins Marc Hogan found the video too \\"focused on Ferreira's model\\" abilities to \\"complement the song effectively\\". Live performances Ferreira had already been performing \\"You're Not the One\\" before its formal release‚Äîat her concert on the last day of the 2013 Pitchfork Music Festival, she sang it as the ninth track of her setlist. After the song's digital release, she promoted it on television shows and radio lounges. On November 26, 2013 she sang the track during an appearance on Late Show with David Letterman, where she wore \\"opaque black sunglasses\\" and a black blazer over a \\"sheer top\\". Ferreira, who opened the American leg of Miley Cyrus' Bangerz Tour, included the song in her setlist for those concerts. On February 27, 2014‚Äîas she was on an interruption from the tour‚ÄîFerreira performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Dressed in a leather jacket, shades and with her hair wet, she was praised by Ben Kaye from Consequence of Sound for her \\"dazzling rendition\\" of the song. \\"You're Not the One\\" was later performed on March 12 of that year on a BBC Radio 1 session.

The company was founded in 2011 by the scientists Janne Kotiaho, Mikko M√∂nkk√∂nen, and Janne- Tuomas Sepp√§nen in Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland. The service was the winner of the 2012 Award for Publishing Innovation from The Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP), and of the 2013 recognition award from Communications Professionals of Finnish Universities. Differences to traditional peer review The service has several practices that differ from the traditional approaches to academic peer review and submissions. =Author control over deadlines= Upon uploading their manuscript to the system, authors specify four deadlines: # Deadline for sending peer reviews # Deadline for peer-review-of-peer-review, the reciprocal judging of the accuracy of peer reviews # Deadline for sending the revised manuscript # Deadline for final evaluation of the revised manuscript During the process, the deadlines are automatically enforced. =Open Engagement= Instead of reviewers being appointed by an editor, reviewers in this system choose what they want to review. Thus, the process may terminate at first deadline if there are no willing peer reviewers, or it may attract many more reviewers than the standard two. According to thesystem, the current average is 2.4 reviewers per manuscript, while some have attracted up to 8. Any user, including the authors themselves, can recommend a reviewer for a manuscript. However, peers from the same institutions as authors, and peers who have co-authored with authors in the last three years, are automatically excluded and can not peer review the manuscript. =Cross-evaluation= The motivation to participate as a peer reviewer in this system stems from a reputation system where the quality of the reviewing is scored by other users, and contributes to one's profile. Evaluation of other peer reviewers is an additional task for participating academics, but most appear to be eager to do this: while other stages are completed typically just before a deadline, the judging task is on average completed in just a few days. =Concurrent and shared journal consideration= Journals participating in the system's Select option have concurrent access to all peer review processes. Editors are free to make publishing offers to authors at any time, and authors are free to choose whether to accept or decline the offers. Journals participating in the system's Connect option have access to a process if authors choose to submit to that journal. In both cases, the same peer reviews are used by several journals, instead of being discarded in the event of rejection from one journal. Business model The company's services are free for scientists, and it does not pay peer reviewers. Publishers owning participating journals pay for usage of the service. Peerage of Science has established such contracts with e.g. Springer,, Taylor & Francis, BioMed Central, Elsevier and Brill.

He signed a five-album deal with Atlantic Records in 2013. He released his debut EP God Loves You When You're Dancing in March 2013. His song \\"Riptide\\" was voted number 1 on the 2013 Triple J Hottest 100. Joy released his debut studio album Dream Your Life Away on 5 September 2014 in Australia and on 9 September 2014 elsewhere. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won Best Male Artist. Early life Joy attended St. Patricks Primary School, Murrumbeena in Melbourne. He was school captain, and graduated from St Kevin's College, Toorak in 2005. Joy later graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws. Prior to his music career, Joy was a promising Australian rules football player. In 2008 and 2009, he played for the Coburg Football Club, then called the Coburg Tigers, as key defender in the Victorian Football League (VFL), winning best first year player award in 2008. Joy explains his choice for a music career over a football one by saying that he \\"[...] wasn't ever really in the mix (for the AFL)\\", being \\"good enough to go from local footy to the VFL. Out of three seasons, I had a handful of games. You always think you can do better, but I think I reached my potential as a football player.\\" In another interview, he stated \\"for a period of time I was super focused on footy, I played a step below professional level. I had opportunities to play for a couple of teams but my heart wasn't completely in it. I guess I was just doing something in the meantime before writing my first songs.\\" Music career Vance Joy on the TV show Sommarkrysset at Gr√∂na Lund, Stockholm in 2014 =2013: God Loves You When You're Dancing= On 21 January 2013, Joy released his debut single \\"From Afar\\".

In 1986 Waldner started as consultant for the French Information Technology and Services company Bull, where he specialized in Computer Integrated Manufacturing. From 1990 to 1993 he was senior manager at Deloitte, senior partner at Computer Sciences Corporation from 1993 to 1996, Program Director for IT and Shared Services Centers at Carrefour from 1999 to 2001, and co- founded his own management consulting firm Waldner Consulting in 2004.  Work  Waldner's research interests ranges from Manufacturing Resource, Planning Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Enterprise Architecture, to Nanoelectronics and Nanocomputers. = Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP/MRP2) = Manufacturing Resource Planning (or MRP2) - Around 1980 The Manufacturing Resource Planning concept has evolved over the past 30 years from a simple means of calculating materials requirements and components (which does not even take into account the production capacity of the company) - to integrated ERP MRP concepts and software to automated management of the entire company.\\"CIM: Principles of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,\\" Jean- Baptiste Waldner, John Wiley & Sons, 1992Sanjay Mohapatra, Business Process Automation, (2009). During the 1980s the increasing changes of sales forecasts, which resulted in continuous and manual adjustments of the production plan, has in led to the MRP (Material Requirement Planning) model, which was strictly limited to the supply of materials. Eventually this evolved in means for wider production resources management, MRP2 (Manufacturing Resources Planning). Waldner (1992) showed, that MRP and MRP2 are essential principles of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)P. Sivakumar, K. Ganesh, Mohapatra Sanjay, S. P.

In the planning process of the enterprise they are the essential link between General Planning and execution and control. Thereby MRP2 covers three phases (see image): * Production programme * Material requirements, * Calculation of workload According to Oliveira (2003) the work of Waldner (1992) and others became \\"an important effort towards the goal of increasing the competitiveness of manufacturing companies through the introduction of automation and wider use of computers.\\" Oliveira, Jos√© Ant√≥nio Barata de. \\"Coalition based approach for shop floor agility‚Äìa multiagent approach.\\" (2003). p. 2.11 = Computer Integrated Manufacturing = Computer Integrated Manufacturing control system According to Waldner (1992) Computer Integrated Manufacturing is used to describe the complete automation of a manufacturing plant, with all processes running under computer control and digital information tying them together. There are three major challenges to development of a smoothly operating computer-integrated manufacturing system: * Integration of components from different suppliers: When different machines, such as CNC, conveyors and robots, are using different communications protocols (In the case of AGVs, even differing lengths of time for charging the batteries) may cause problems. * Data integrity: The higher the degree of automation, the more critical is the integrity of the data used to control the machines. While the computer integrated manufacturing system saves on labor of operating the machines, it requires extra human labor in ensuring that there are proper safeguards for the data signals that are used to control the machines. * Process control: Computers may be used to assist the human operators of the manufacturing facility, but there must always be a competent engineer on hand to handle circumstances which could not be foreseen by the designers of the control software. Machado et al. (2000) explained that \\"control, monitoring and supervision of industrial processes are increasingly demanding a great investment in technological solutions each time more embedded and with real-time capabilities, especially devoted to the interconnect, in an intelligent way, of shop-floor equipment with operational information systems.\\"Machado, Ricardo J., Jo√£o M.

Possible origins The origin of the term is unclear but it may come from one of the following: * bongo drums believed to be played by African natives * a parody of African place-names or languages, particularly those in Bantu languages. Bantu languages avoid consonant clusters and almost all words end in vowels, and reduplication is commonly used to mark intensity or frequency. There is a reference to \\"Bongoland\\" in the English translation by Ellen Elizabeth Frewer of a book originally in German by Georg August Schweinfurth, published in 1874 in English as The Heart of Africa. Schweinfurth locates it as lying between 6-8 degrees North and in the south-western region of the Bahr-el-Ghazal (South Sudan). The Belgian explorer Adolphe de Calonne-Beaufaict also refers to the 'Bongo of the Bahr- el-Ghazal' in his 1921 study of the Azande. de Calonne-Beaufaict, A.

In 1985, Alan Clark, while Conservative Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton, once, in a departmental meeting, allegedly referred to Africa as \\"Bongo Bongo Land\\".7 February 1985 \\"Tory minister faces row over race remark\\" Financial Times When called to account, however, Clark denied the comment had any racist overtones, saying it had simply been a reference to the President of Gabon, Omar Bongo.Clark, A. The Last Diaries: In and Out of the Wilderness, Phoenix, 2003, p. 219. In 2004, Taki Theodoracopulos called Kenya \\"bongo-bongo land\\" in his Spectator column. The Guardian later criticized his use of \\"offensive and outdated stereotypes\\". In July 2013, Godfrey Bloom, Member of the European Parliament for Yorkshire and the Humber for the UK Independence Party (UKIP), was filmed referring to countries which receive overseas aid from the United Kingdom as \\"Bongo Bongo Land\\". UKIP later banned use of the term, and while Bloom refused to apologise for his remarks, he later stated that he regretted \\"any genuine offence which might have been caused.\\" A spokesperson from Show Racism the Red Card stated that Bloom's remarks were \\"crude stereotypes that see Britain as a civilised place and overseas as tribal\\". Matthew d'Ancona wrote in The Daily Telegraph: \\"There may indeed be some who inwardly cheered Bloom‚Äôs choice of words.

The expedition occupied Lhasa on February 12 and officially deposed the 13th Dalai Lama on the 25th.  History  Qing rule of Tibet was established in the early 18th century after the 1720 Chinese expedition to Tibet. After the British expedition to Tibet in 1904 and the Sino-British treaty in 1906, the Qing sent the 1910 expedition to Tibet to assert full control. As Professor Dawa Norbu stated, the British expedition and Treaty of Lhasa forced China to establish firm military control over Tibet. Afterwards, the Dalai Lama then fled to India. In the late winter of 1910, the Qing government in Beijing was furious with the 13th Dalai Lama. His government, having witnessed the dissolution of its domains in Khams by Qing administrators, and fearing that the amban in Lhasa was going to eliminate its temporal authority, cut this imperial officer off from the sustenance that the Tibet government had guaranteed him in a prior agreement with the Qing court. When a relief column arrived in Lhasa from Sichuan to break the amban out of his isolation, the Dalai Lama fled for British India.Max Oidtmann, Playing the Lottery with Sincere Thoughts: the Manchus and the selection of incarnate lamas during the last days of the Qing, Academia.edu, 40 p., p. 1.

Biography  Crist√≥v√£o Tezza was born in Lages, Santa Catarina, Brazil in 1952, but moved to Curitiba in Paran√° by the time he was ten. This city would later serve as the backdrop for many of his stories, with characters visiting familiar streets and local attractions. Tezza had a variety of jobs when he was younger. His experience included time in the theater and the merchant marine, working illegally in Europe, and working as a watchmaker. He really loved this last job, but soon recognized that fixing clocks would not satisfy his desire to work with literature. By the time he was thirteen, Tezza had already finished his first book, one which he himself described as \\"very bad.\\" He has published several novels, and a creative autobiography. One of the distinguishing features of his works is the presence of more than one narrator. For example, in his story Trapo the story is told simultaneously from the points of view of both a teacher of poetry, Manoel, and a poet, whose work is studied by Manoel. In 2003, Tezza published an essay on Mikhail Bakhtin, which he had originally written as his doctoral thesis. Tezza has a doctorate in Brazilian Literature, and was a professor of Linguistics at the Federal University of Paran√°. On several occasions he has claimed that only four or five Brazilians could make their living from writing books, and for this reason he became a professor. He won the prize of the Brazilian Academy of Letters for the Best Brazilian Novel in 2004, for his book \\"O fot√≥grafo‚Äù. The magazine √âpoca named him as one of the 100 Most Influential Brazilians of 2009. He also served on the jury to determine the finalists for the 2013 Portugal Telecom Prize. Until recently, Tezza wrote a biweekly column for the Folha de S.Paulo and was a regular contributor to the Gazeta do Povo, in Curitiba. In 2009, following the success of The Eternal Son, Tezza left his position as a university professor to pursue his literary interests full-time.  The Eternal Son  Tezza's most successful work so far has been The Eternal Son (Portuguese: O Filho Eterno), a novel about a father learning to deal with his son's Down's syndrome. In 2008 his book was recognized by the Jabuti Prize, the Portugal Telecom Prize, and the S√£o Paulo Prize for Literature, the last of which came with a cash prize of R$200,000 (roughly US$97,000 dollars). This book was later adapted for the theater by Bruno Lara Resende. The presentation by Cia Atores de Laura, with director Daniel Herz, and actor Charles Fricks was chosen by O Globo as one of the best plays of 2011. With the success of the play, it has been announced that the book will also be made into a movie, directed by Paulo Machline. The Eternal Son has been translated into several languages including English, with the French translation winning the 2009 Prix litt√©raire Charles-Brisset and the English translation being a finalist for the 2012 International Dublin Literary Award.

He was the cellist of the Kneisel Quartet from 1891 to 1907. Alwin was the youngest of four sons of Carl Schroeder (Karl Schr√∂der I, 1816‚Äì1890 or 1823‚Äì1889), the music director in Neuhaldensleben. He had three older brothers that were also musicians: Hermann Schroeder (1843‚Äì1909) became a composer and violin professor in Berlin, Germany; Carl Karl Schr√∂der II II (1848‚Äì1935) became a cello professor in the Leipzig Conservatory before being appointed as court conductor to the Prince of Sondershausen in 1881; and Franz (born before 1855 ‚Äì ?) would work as a conductor in St. Petersburg, Russia. Alwin was seven years old when he began his music studies, he received piano lessons from his father and violin lessons from his eldest brother. Later, he studied the piano with J. B.

Battle of Medina del Rio Seco Following the defeat of General Gregorio Garc√≠a de la Cuesta‚Äôs small and inexperienced Army of Castile at the Battle of Cabez√≥n, which had forced Cuesta to abandon his seat of command at Valladolid to General Lasalle and escape to Benavente, Blake was ordered to combine the troops of his newly formed army with what was left of Cuesta‚Äôs forces. Blake had initially turned down a request to do so as the troops were still undergoing training and far short of their full numbers. Setting off with 27,000 foot soldiers and 150 cavalrymen, and after having left troops at different garrisons along the way, especially to guard the gorges,Thiers, Adolphe (1812) Historical Works, Volume 3, p. 171.

Moreover, imposing his seniority against the younger Blake's objections, Cuesta claimed supreme command and insisted on a foolhardy march on Valladolid to reclaim his lost city. Setting his columns marching on July 12, he laid his new, combined force vulnerable to a French counterattack.

Merlin had entered the city the previous August to suppress the revolt against King Joseph and in doing so, had, in the words of the king himself, ensured that the \\"fire of insurrection was quenched with the blood of twelve hundred men\\". These numbers were likely exaggerated as according to the source cited they fire bombed Bilbao port and took vessels from the city.Napier, William Francis Patrick and Mathieu Dumas (1828) Histoire de la guerre dans la P√©ninsule et dans le midi de la France, depuis l'ann√©e 1807 jusqu'a l'ann√©e 1814, Volume I, p. 287.

Battle of Pancorbo Following the French retreat from the disaster at the Battle of Bail√©n (16‚Äì19 July 1808), Blake took up positions opposite the enemy on the banks of the Ebro. On 31 October, the 24,000 men of Marshal Lefebvre's IV Corps attacked Blake's 19,000 men at Pancorbo. By retreating swiftly, Blake was able to prevent being trapped by Napoleon's planned envelopment and annihilation of the Spanish flank. Battle of Valmaseda  Napoleon, reaching Vitoria on 8 November, to take matters in hand personally, had dispatched Lefebvre and Victor in pursuit of Blake, with Victor having orders to outmanoeuvre Blake and sweep across his line of retreat. The French were careless and allowed their forces to disperse during the pursuit. On 5 November, Blake surprised his enemies again when, at Valmaseda, he suddenly turned on his pursuers and attacked the French vanguard, inflicting a defeat on the leading division. When another French corps approached, Blake went west once more to evade encirclement. Battle of Espinosa Having successfully managed, with the help of the Royal Navy, to reach Santander with 9,000 men, of the 15,000-strong Division of the North stationed in Denmark, Romana was given command of the Army of Galicia on 11 November 1808. However, that same day, still effectively under Blake, the Army of Galicia was severely beaten at Espinosa de los Monteros, away in the Cantabrian Mountains, where Blake had chosen to make another stand on 10 November. Victor, trying to avenge himself for his earlier humiliations at the hands of Blake, spent the day recklessly flinging his divisions against the Spanish troops without success. The next day, however, a well-coordinated French attack shattered Blake's centre and routed his army. Blake lost 3,000 men in the battle, and many thousands more were dispersed in the confusion of retreat. Knowing his Army of Galicia to be irreparably shattered, Blake marched west into the hills, outdistancing his pursuers, under Soult, and managing to carry out important rearguard actions to help General Moore's retreat to Corunna. Blake reached L√©on on 23 November with only 10,000 men and command was then passed to General La Romana, who took command of the new Ej√©rcito de la Izquierda on 26 November. The following year, in July 1809, this army would also incorporate the Asturian regiments under Francisco Ballesteros. Battle of Villafranca (17 March 1809) On 17 March 1809, De la Romana‚Äôs troops defeated the French at the Battle of Villafranca, a garrison at Villafranca del Bierzo. Following the defeat of Marshall Ney at the Battle of Puente Sanpayo (7‚Äì9 June 1809), Marshal Soult abandoned his attempts to re- establish French rule in Galicia, and when Soult moved against the British on the Portuguese frontier, Romana was able to drive the French from Asturias as well. Battle of San Marcial At the Battle of San Marcial (31 August 1813), the IV Ej√©rcito (IV Army), also known as the Army of Galicia, and under the orders of General Manuel Freire de Andrade, defeated Marshal Soult in what would be his last major offensive against the allied forces led by Wellington. Freire, promoted to general, succeeded Casta√±os, who had been called to the Cortes, at the beginning of August 1813.

Wither was born in 1822 at Manydown Park, a manor in Wootton St Lawrence, Hampshire, England. His father was Harris Bigg-Wither (1781‚Äì1838), who was Lord of the Manor at Manydown from 1813 to 1833 and is famous for having proposed to Jane Austen. The engineer and writer Thomas Plantagenet Bigg- Wither, a son of his eldest brother Lovelace Bigg-Wither (1805‚Äì1874), was his nephew. The Lords of the Manor at Manydown were initially from the Wither family. When William Wither V (1733‚Äì1789) died, he had no heir, and a cousin with the surname Bigg ‚Äî the Reverend Lovelace Bigg (1741‚Äì1813) ‚Äî became his successor. He and his sons took on the surname Bigg-Wither. In all New Zealand sources, Charles Bigg Wither is referred to simply as Wither (or C. B. Wither) and thus appears to have used Bigg as his middle name only. Wither received his education at Winchester and at the University of Edinburgh. He came to New Zealand on the Ursula in 1843 and settled near Nelson. He owned a sheep station at the Taylor River upstream from Blenheim from about 1848. He sold the land in 1867 to Ralph Richardson and to the father of Henry Redwood. The Wither Hills south of Blenheim, which were part of his sheep run, are named for him. Wither himself lived in Richmond where he had another farm. Wither was one of the original nine trustees of Nelson College; other notable foundation trustees were Charles Elliott, David Monro, John Barnicoat, William Wells, and Alfred Domett. Wither was a member of the Legislative Council from 15 October to 9 November 1863, when he resigned. His membership appeared in a gazette notice (it stated that he had been summoned to the council), but he declined the membership. Wither died at Wensley Hill in Richmond on 28 June 1894.

Locally produced television dramas have helped contribute to a unique cultural identity among the Hong Kong population and serve as a cultural resource for the Cantonese Chinese speaking community worldwide. History Local broadcast television in Hong Kong was first produced in 1957 with the launch of Rediffusion Television, making it the first territory in Greater China and colony of the British Empire to be served by local TV.Kitley, Philip. [2003] (2003). Television, Regulation and Civil Society in Asia. Routledge. TVB was later founded in 1967 to become the territory's first free-to-air television network.The company registered on 26 July 1965 C.R. No:0011781ÔºàTelevision Broadcasts LimitedÔºâ‚ÄîThe Cyber Search Centre of the Integrated Companies Registry Information System With a massive influx of refugees from Mainland China coming into a rapidly industrializing Hong Kong during the 1960s and 1970s, the television medium became a prominent force in shaping local identity and formed a cultural resource. The development of early television dramas in the 1970s and early 1980s proved to be enormously successful, with viewership of the ending for primetime serials sometimes creating ratings as high as 70%. Television dramas tended to stray away from Chinese traditionalism, with themes relating more to those of industrialized societies, such as personal survival over collective good, reflecting Hong Kong's global position as a modernizing Asian Tiger economy. By the 1980s, television dramas had become a cultural icon of Hong Kong throughout East and Southeast Asia, with the territory becoming a center for television and film production. Furthermore, the success of the Hong Kong television industry later served as a major influence for television in mainland China and other industrializing Asian nations, most notably Taiwan and South Korea. Audience and reception Hong Kong television dramas, along with cinema, have fostered an identity for the Cantonese speakers separate to those of Standard Mandarin. As a result, Cantonese has been able to maintain a prominent standing relative to other non-Mandarin Chinese dialects. The success of early Hong Kong television dramas throughout East and Southeast Asia has resulted in their continued popularity throughout the regions, as well as with Chinese immigrant populations around the world. In fact, Hong Kong media became so influential in China's neighboring Guangdong Province (which is traditionally Cantonese- speaking) in the 1980s, that in 1988 the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television allowed for the local production of Cantonese television broadcasts in order to countermeasure against Hong Kong influence. This is a notable exception from the Chinese government's strict measures against the broadcasting and public usage of local dialects, which usually must be given approval by local and national authorities. The popularity of Hong Kong television programs in Taiwan has resulted in the launch of a TVB affiliate network in the country, TVBS, with the TVBS Entertainment Channel largely rebroadcasting Hong Kong dramas. Furthermore, TVB has also created the affiliate channels of TVB Korea and TVB Vietnam in South Korea and Vietnam respectively. Over the past decade, TVB has consistently received a much larger market share over its competitor ATV, which in turn has reported consecutive losses. Much criticism has been due to ATV's lack of variety in programming, including television dramas that are largely out of touch with Hong Kong locals, and a pro-Beijing government stance.Survival drama , The Standard, 2008. Genres and subject matter Subject content and themes in Hong Kong television drama often reflect the ideals and attitudes of the general populace in the present state of the territory. For example, during the rapid development of Hong Kong during the 1960s to mid-1980s, characteristics deemed too traditional, such as communal benefit that is emphasized in traditional Chinese values, were ignored in favor of \\"Western, industrialized values\\" such as personal gain and material wealth, and became reflected in drama themes. The approach of the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong saw themes in television dramas shift from the general optimism of growth to increased pessimism fueled by the possible consequences of Chinese rule reflected by Hong Kongers. More recently, the increasing antagonism in relations between local Hong Kong residents and mainland Chinese has also found its way as a central theme in local TV dramas.Hong Kong TV Drama Plays Out Uneasy Ties With China, New York Times, 2013 While the majority of Hong Kong television drama serials are set in the present, historical themes set in imperial China or colonial Hong Kong are also popular. Genres of modern themed serials can include, but are not limited to: criminal and/or judicial, medical, supernatural, or comedy. The martial arts genre that has become a trademark of Hong Kong cinema is also often used in imperial Chinese themed serials.

Her life was cut short in 1944 when a Soviet Communist soldier killed her after she resisted his rape attempt. Those who knew her best described her as being a modest and simple girl who attended Mass each morning and assumed care of the household following her mother's death in her late childhood. Her beatification process opened in 2004 and she became titled as a Servant of God upon the cause's launch. The process culminated on 6 March 2018 after Pope Francis confirmed that she had died \\"in defensum castitatis\\" (meaning to preserve herself as a virgin) and had confirmed her beatification. The beatification was celebrated on 1 September 2018 in Slovakia. Life =Childhood and adolescence= Anna Koles√°rov√° was born on 14 July 1928 in the Michalovce District in the former Czechoslovakia to J√°n Koles√°r (known to friends as \\"Hru≈°ka\\") and Anka Ku≈°n√≠rov√°. Anna was the youngest of three, she had a half sister, Mary, and a brother Michal. Her baptism was celebrated in their local parish on 15 July. The Koles√°rs were described as a pious farmers that were frequent Mass attendees who lived out their faith in concrete manners. Her mother died sometime after she turned ten and it fell upon her to assume care of the household and for her older brother Michal. Those around her described her life as being both modest and simple while also noting her frequent presence at church. Koles√°rov√° attended Mass with her friends after she completed the household chores. In 1944 - in the autumn - the final and bloodiest phase to World War II (the Eastern front) was passing through the eastern district of Michalovce which was then a part of the Hungarian nation. It was during this violent transition period that the people living in surrounding villages would hide in their cellars to wait for the shelling and fighting to end. =Murder= On 22 November 1944 the Red army soldiers entered the town. Her father Jan sheltered with his children and their neighbors in the cellar under the kitchen. During a tour of the house one drunken Soviet soldier discovered the hideout and peered inside. Koles√°rov√°'s father bade her to \\"give him something to eat\\" and so she emerged from the hideout and walked up to the kitchen to serve the soldier food and water in the hopes of maintaining peace and to prove that she and the others posed no threat to the soldier. The uncertain nature of the war prompted her and other women in the village to wear black dresses in order not to attract unwanted attention to themselves and to discourage improper behavior from the soldiers. But this did not deter the soldier from making unwanted sexual advances towards her.http://www.catholicsun.org/2018/08/22/anna- kolesarova/https://annakolesarova.sk/en/ Koles√°rov√° refused his advances and pulled herself out of his grip as he attempted to rape her.https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/8720/murdered-slovak-peasant-girl-to-be- declared-blessed- The soldier pursued her to the basement. There the soldier jumped her and ordered her to die in front of her father before he pointed his PPSh-41 automatic rifle at her and killed her on the spot for her refusal; she was killed in front of her father and brother with two shots to the face and chest. Her final words were recorded as: \\"Goodbye father! Jesus, Mary, Joseph!\\" The girl had made her confession and had received Communion not long before she was killed. Her remains were buried the next evening despite the intense fighting occurring in the area but the funeral was conducted without a priest in secret so as to remain safe. The priest Anton Luk√°ƒç celebrated the solemn funeral rites one week later on 29 November 1944. =Aftermath= Luk√°ƒç was the parish priest for the village of Pavlovce nad Uhom and later himself investigated her death. He interviewed the villagers and obtained signed statements from five witnesses. He then recorded the incident into his parish's chronicles and in the register noted that she died to defend her innocence. The Jesuit priest Michal Potocky also provided information about Koles√°rov√°'s life and the circumstances surrounding her death. Despite this - and after the war had ended - the new socialist government of Czechoslovakia banned mention of the incident and enforced a strict ban on open gatherings at the grave site. The house that she once lived still remains. It now is used by an organization founded and dedicated to her for people of her age. The Domcek organization organizes volunteer work as well as social events and workshops. There are also frequent pilgrimages to her grave (three times per year, in February, April and August) while in Pavlovce nad Uhom there is a large gathering that is dedicated to her which is popular among adolescents. Beatification The beatification process commenced on 3 July 2004 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled her as a Servant of God and declared \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) to the cause. The diocesan investigation into her life and murder was opened in Ko≈°ice on 2 April 2005 and was closed on 14 February 2012 after hearing from 38 people. The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan process in Rome on 14 June 2013 and received the 650-paged Positio dossier from the postulation (officials leading the cause) in 2015 for evaluation. Theologians approved the cause following their assessment of the dossier as did the C.C.S. members later on 6 February 2018. Her beatification received official confirmation on 6 March 2018 after Pope Francis confirmed that Koles√°rov√° had died \\"in defensum castitatis\\" (meaning to defend herself as a virgin). The beatification was celebrated in her native Slovakia on 1 September 2018 and around 30 000 people attended the Mass. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Andrea Ambrosi. The current vice- postulator is Juraj Jurica.

Biography Vlajkoviƒá grew up in Belgrade city quarter ƒåubura of Vraƒçar municipality. He attended the XIV Belgrade Gymnasium, graduating with maturity diploma in 1956. After that, he studied at the Faculty of Law of Belgrade University and graduated with diploma in 1962. After completion of his academic education, he worked as court reporter of the newspaper Borba until 1963, there he realized that he was not living in a society of justice, that theory taught at university and judicial practice are two different things. Leaving his despised job, he started his professional career as radio journalist and contributing editor of cultural program of Radio Belgrade in the same year, but after six years, he was demoted in his job and restricted in his activities, because his views were inappropriate in ideological way of thinking. He left his job again, got a scholarship for going abroad and took the opportunity to study at Sorbonne in Paris, where he listened to lectures of theater studies and became assistant of Antoine Vitez from 1971-72. Back in Belgrade again, he continued working at Radio Belgrade until retirement, in spite of numerous conflicts with the staff members who were refusing to apply new tendencies and ideas in the domain of radio program. In the meantime, he wrote twenty-five books of fiction and fifty plays of various genres. Svetozar Vlajkoviƒá spent a big part of his professional life during Titoism, and he retrospectively describes the cultural atmosphere of this period as follows: Tito was an uneducated man, he became ruler thanks to a group of uneducated people. At the same time, these nations were also people of little faith and needed a strong leader. Tito surrounded himself with rude, arrogant, but obedient people. They chose their audience on the basis of a kinship decision, creating a pyramid of power that conquered the entire population. Only a few educated people were either exiled, liquidated or taken up into the pyramid. I have written a lot about influencing the suppression of our language, the decay of the family as the foundation of good education and spirituality, but what good is it if there's a well-established technique of silence.Svetozar Vlajkoviƒá official websiteBiography in: Ko je ko u Srbiji, Bibliofon, Belgrade 1996 (WBIS).Kod nas je pojam ‚Äûƒçast‚Äú izbaƒçen iz upotrebe, Peƒçat, retrieved 2019-11-06. Works =Prose= At the beginning of his literary work, he was discovered by Serbian surrealists such as Marko Ristiƒá and Du≈°an Matiƒá and praised for his overflowing poetic fantasy and excessive power of imagination. ƒåedomir Mirkoviƒá wrote a comment about his work in concise and short style: Vlajkovic's stories are characterized by a strong need to be skeptical, melancholy and lonely, the dominant feelings of today's city dwellers, reserved and disguised by irony, humor, curiosity, erotic enthusiasm in harmony with the Zeitgeist. Vlajkoviƒá even distanced himself from the public marketing of literature in the positive as well as the negative sense and still expressed it with a certain sarcasm: manipulation by the media has attracted so much attention that even our thin readership in this country is completely confused. If the tabloid repeats five thousand times that someone is a genius, even if he is an idiot, he will penetrate as a certain significance in the consciousness of the readership.

The show was produced through Radical Sheep Productions, a company founded by Robert Mills in 1985. The Ruffus character had previously appeared in the educational video series The Adventures of Ruffus & Andy in the early 1990s, as produced by the Credit Valley Hospital in Mississauga, Ontario, where Ruffus and his owner Andy learned medical lessons. When Robert Mills left Radical Sheep in 2002, ownership and rights to the award-winning series were transferred to his new company, Hunky Dorey Entertainment. Mills, who also performs the title role of Ruffus, is now distributing the original series and subsequent new works online. The first major production was a re-telling of the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol with Ruffus playing Scrooge. Currently, the Ruffus Project is embarking on production of a new web series entitled: Ruffus The Dog's Steampunk Adventure. Also in the works are a series of illustrated book titles and a pre-school web series entitled: Ruffus Rhymes. Synopsis Ruffus the Dog runs a bookshop in a small town. There, he reads a famous fairy tale to the viewers. In the story, Ruffus and several other characters portray different characters in the tale. At the end, he tells about the moral of the story to the viewers.

He synthesized the first fully synthetic opioid analgesic, methadone, together with Max Bockm√ºhl.  Education and professional positions  Ehrhart studied chemistry at the University of Heidelberg, with a focus on organic chemistry. His studies were interrupted by the First World War. He served as an artillery officer. After the war he resumed his studies and was awarded a doctorate degree in 1922. One of his professors was Theodor Curtius. Ehrhart received the Victor-Meyer Award for his dissertation.Prof. Dr. phil. Dr. Dr. h.c. Gustav Ehrhart wurde 75 Jahre. In: Der praktische Tierarzt. Volume 51, 1970, pp. 64. In 1923 he started working for Hoechst AG. Two years later he became the deputy of Max Bockm√ºhl, the head of the pharmaceutical research laboratories of the company. In 1949, after the Second World War, Erhardt succeeded Bockm√ºhl as the head of the entire pharmaceutical research division of Hoechst AG. In 1951 he became a deputy member of the Board, and two years later a regular member of Hoechst AG's Board of Directors. During his time on the Board of Hoechst AG and after his retirement in 1961 Ehrhart maintained a laboratory which he personally supervised.W. Bartmann: Zwischen Tradition und Fortschritt.

In: Der praktische Tierarzt.

Gustav Ehrhart. In: Der praktische Tierarzt. Volume 51, 1970, pp. 258. Products synthesized  Ehrhart's main focus was the development of new analgesics (painkillers). His most notable contribution is the development of methadone, which he synthesized together with his boss Bockm√ºhl in 1939. In the winter of 1937-38, Erhart and Bockm√ºhl began the synthesis of over 300 compounds which contained diphenylmethane as a central structural element.G. Ehrhart, O. Schaumann: Polamidon, ein neues, stark wirkendes Analgetikum. In: Med Monatsschr. Volume 3, 1949, pp. 605-606. In late 1939 they gave the compound (¬±)-6-dimethylamino-4, 4-diphenylheptan-3-one the development code VA 10820. In the first animal experiments, Ehrhart and Bockm√ºhl found that VA 10820 had a five- to ten-fold stronger analgesic effect than pethidine.M. Bockm√ºhl, G. Ehrhart: √úber eine neue Klasse von spasmolytisch und analgetisch wirkenden Verbindungen (I). In: Liebig Ann Chem. Volume 561, 1949, pp. 52-85. In mid-1941, VA 10820 was given the generic name Amidon. Bockm√ºhl and Ehrhart filed a patent on 11 September 1938 for the whole substance class.M. Bockm√ºhl, G. Ehrhart: Verfahren zur Darstellung von basischen Estern. Deutsches Reichspatent Nr. 711069, Anmeldedatum: 11. September 1938, Ver√∂ffentlichung: 25. September 1941. Due to the turmoil of the Second World War, Amidon was not clinically tested any further. Due to the expropriation of IG Farben's patents and recipes, VA 10820 came to the United States, where it was given the international nonproprietary name methadone in 1949. In the same year Eli Lilly marketed it under the brand name Dolophine. In January 1949 Hoechst AG, which had re-formed after the dissolution of IG Farben with Ehrhart as its research director, marketed methadone as a strong painkiller under the brand name Polamidone.E.

These microbes have a thick polypeptide layer. Enterococcus can be found in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other mammals. In a study on the enterococcal flora of swine, E. malodoratus was found in the intestines and feces. It was not identified within the tonsils of swine, nor within cats, calves, dogs, horse, or poultry. The name \\"malodoratus\\" translates to \\"ill smelling\\". Physiology E. malodoratus is a nonmotile, facultatively anaerobic microbe, as well as a chemoorganotroph with fermentative metabolism. The cells are coccoid in structure, found mostly in pairs or short streptococcus chains. Unlike many other Enterococcus species, E. malodoratus does not usually grow at 45 degrees Celsius, nor does it survive heating at 60 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. It is nonpigmented. E. malodoratus does not produce methylcarbinol or hydrolyze arginine. In carbohydrate and raffinose broths, E. malodoratus forms acid. It does not form endospores thus separating it from bacilli and clostridia species. Pathology The genus Enterococcus is \\"capable of inducing platelet aggregation and tissue factor-dependent fibrin production, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of enterococcal endocarditis\\". The microbe is frequently the cause of hospital-acquired noscomial infections, bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections in its host. Though a normal part of the biota of the intestinal tract of humans and other mammals, Enterococci can also survive for lengths of time with adhesion to environmental surfaces; thus contributing to transmission and possible contagion between hosts. The genus has also been proven to survive desiccation. In general, the inhospitable, acidic, and competitive environment of the gastrointestinal tract limits the spread of enterococci. However, it is often during the early stages of a medical intervention that the enterococci can successfully move and colonize beyond the neutral area near the colon. Diagnosis/identification DNA methods have been used by researchers to correctly identify specific species within the genus Enterococcus. Using the chaperonin 60 gene (Cpn60), specific species of DNA sequencing can be distinguished in the ~600-bp region. It is imperative to correctly distinguish between Enterococcus species, as some species have been found to be resistant to some drug therapies. In fact, the genus Enterococcus has become important in the study of super infections and pathogenic resistance to antibiotics. E. malodoratus, specifically, has not yet been found to have developed that resistance. Historical Until 1984, all Enterococcus species were considered part of the genus Streptococcus. It was during the 1980s that studies on fatty acid composition, nucleic acid hybridization, and comparative oligonucleotide cataloguing of 16s RNA showed the significant differences between enterococci and streptococci. The differences were enough to establish Enterococcus as a genus of its own. Each species within the enterococci category was reclassified, including E. malodoratus ‚Äì originally known as S. faecalis subsp. malodoratus.

She is a Professor of Media Studies at the University of Turku, and was a visiting scholar at MIT in 2016. She gained her PhD from the University of Turku in 2002; her dissertation was on gender and the popularization of the internet, which was later published through Peter Lang. After holding positions at the universities of Tampere, Jyv√§skyl√§ and Helsinki, Paasonen was appointed Professor of Media Studies at the University of Turku on 1 August 2011, and publishes on internet research, media theory, sexuality, pornography and affect.  Research  On Monday, 4 April 2016, Paasonen gave a lecture at Brown University in the USA on the politics and culture of online porn. In the essay, \\"Glimmers of the forbidden fruit: Reminiscing pornography, conceptualizing the archive,\\" written along with Katariina Kyr√∂l√§, Paasonen traces the evolution of the \\"porn stash\\" from a physical collection to a digital one, and in doing so, examines cyberporn as a site of identity formation. She and Kyr√∂l√§ suggest that pornography occasions the accumulation of a somatic archive, which are \\"not merely reservoirs of extra-cognitive sensation but also knowingly curated, reflected upon and reworked: they are simultaneously material and semiotic, intimate and culturally specific, affective and open to representation.\\" In her lecture at Brown, Paasonen suggested that digital pornography must not be understood as something that creeps into society from the outside, but rather as something that already exists in contemporary culture. She writes, \\"Encounters with pornography therefore become incorporated as carnal capacity-- as what we can imagine our bodies enjoying and being capable of, or not enjoying and being capable of.\\" Paasonen argues, therefore, that interactions with pornography, therefore, can contribute to the development of an individual's sexual identity.  Awards  The Finnish Academy of Science awarded her the Jutikkala Prize of ‚Ç¨15,000 14 October 2011. In the same year Paasonen published the book, Carnal Resonance: Affect and Online Pornography, through MIT Press.  Bibliography  =Books=   * *Paasonen, Susanna (2018).

Start up in business Son of Leopold Veillet and Georgina Magny, Jeffrey Veillet was born May 21, 1881 in the \\"Rang des chutes\\" (rank of falls) (said rang \\"Veillet\\") in Saint-Narcisse de Champlain (Quebec). His father Leopold was a forestry entrepreneur, especially in the \\"Chapeau de paille\\" (hat of straw) area on the west bank of the Saint-Maurice River, up to Rivi√®re-aux- Rats (Rats River).TV interview in 1987 of Gaetan Veillette with R√©sima Veillet (sister of Jeffrey Veillet), a resident of Sainte-Th√®cle. Cameraman: Raynald Saint-Amand Sainte-Th√®cle Jeffrey Veillet moved to Sainte-Th√®cle in 1903, at the age of 22, and married Herminie Cossette, from Saint-Narcisse on April 26, 1904. Veillet acquired a farm in rang St-Pierre-North, where he started a business of hay and cattle; he sold this land to his brother Freddy. He bought a second farm in rang Saint-Pierre-North, close to the village of Sainte- Th√®cle; he operated there for five or six years and continued his trade in animals; he sold the farm to his brother Alph√©e in 1921. In addition, Jeffrey Veillet owned two farms in rang Saint-Thomas-South, that he operated for commercial hay, sent by train to his clients. Commerce in Sainte-Th√®cle Former general store of Jeffrey Veillette, Saint-Jacques Street, in Sainte- Th√®cle (facing the church), in July 2018. Around 1921, Veillet bought the Hotel Boutet, opposite to Sainte-Th√®cle church, that he turned into the general store. This building became the headquarters of his forestry operations. The Hotel Boutet was built around 1902 or 1903 by Fran√ßois Boutet, just at the beginning of the work of building the church. It has been in operation during twenty years. After the acquisition of the building, Veillet transformed the second floor in a private residence, coupled with a general store on the ground floor. The store sold almost all the needs of residents, farmers and loggers: groceries, dry goods, fabrics by the yard, clothing, dresses, ironwork, molded feed, seed, shingles, sheet, gasoline (Imperial petroleum) oil and coal. The store occupied the entire front of the building. In the back, a cooler storing ice cut on the Lac Croche in the coldest of winter, was used until about 1935 to 1936, for the needs of families Veillet and Moisan (next house). Forestry contractor In 1920, four sons of Leopold Veillet and Georgina Magny (i.e. Jeffrey, Freddy, Alph√©e and Wilson) combined officially their resources to start a business. They were fully engaged in cutting and timber trade. This loggers family already had extensive experience in the operation of forest sites in Mauricie region. In 1921, Josaphat Veillet joined his brothers and founded the company Veillette & Fr√®res Limit√©e (Veillette & Brothers Limited). Two co-shareholders died a little while later: Wilson Veillet accidentally in August 1924 and Alph√©e Veillet in October 1927. In 1925, Jeffrey Veillet executed contracts of clearing the road from Saint- Roch-de-M√©kinac to La Tuque on the east bank of Saint-Maurice River.Ga√©tan Veillette, article \\"L'homme d'affaires Jeffrey Veillet (1881-1946) de Sainte- Th√®cle dirigea jusqu'√† 6,000 travailleurs forestiers\\" (The businessman Jeffrey Veillet (1881-1946) of Sainte-Th√®cle supervised up to 6,000 forest workers), Bulletin \\"Le Pathiskan\\", published by the \\"Association des familles Veillet/te d'Am√©rique\\" (Association of Veillet/te families of Am√©rica inc.), March 1994, p. 14 to 24, (part 2). Two sawmills along the Tawachiche River In 1922, the company Veillet & Fr√®res Limit√©e (Veillette and Brothers Limited) was awarded a contract to cut timber in the Audy area, north of Hervey-Jonction in the sector of Tawachiche River. The company then bought a small sawmill from Frank Blais, located about one kilometer south of the Audy station, on the edge of the Tawachiche River. The Veillet make enlargements to the mill. Powered by steam, the mill was operated about 16 years, until 1934, especially for cutting wood planks and beams. The second Veillet sawmill was built on the edge of the Tawachiche River, about 500 meters north of the village of Hervey- Jonction. It was mainly used for cutting wood pulp. It ran from 1933 to 1941. Saw Mill in the city of Saint-Tite (1936-1938) About 1936-1937, Jeffrey Veillet acquired from Rouleau their second sawmill located near the Rivi√®re des Envies, in the heart of the city of Saint-Tite which was unused for several years.Book \\"Histoire de Saint-Tite (1833-1984)\\" (History of Saint-Tite - 1833-1984), √âdition Souvenance inc., Historical Committee, p. 222, Chapter IV, written by Pierre Lebrun Although the Veillet mill in Audy was closed, Veillet & Fr√®res Limit√©e continued cutting hard and soft wood in Tawachiche River area. The cut wood was then transported to the saw mill of Saint-Tite by truck. Wood also came from the lake Vlimeux area, located in Lejeune Township, at north-west of Sainte-Th√®cle, close to Grandes-Piles limit. The Saint-Tite mill ceased operations in the fall of 1938. Facilities at this mill were demolished a few years later. Sawmill at Lake Jesuit, in Sainte-Th√®cle In the summer of 1938, Jeffrey and Freddy Veillet built another sawmill at the south end of Lake Jesuit in Sainte-Th√®cle, near the outlet. The equipment of the mill came from the demolition of the old mill located in Audy (North of Hervey-Jonction). In the area north of Lake Jesuit, the first logging of hardwood were conducted in winter 1938-1939 to be sawn at the mill in the spring. The building of this mill operated by the power of steam consisted of two stages: the kettle was at the lower level and all the lumbering was done on the second floor. The elevator block was an endless chain, equipped with grapples. The driftwood was pulled by a steam boat from the northern end of the lake. In 1945, Freddy Veillette bought the shares of his brother on the sawmill of Lake Jesuit. Freddy continued operation until his death in 1949. This sawmill was sold from 1942 to 1943 to a company that took the equipment and the buildings demolished. Forestry Operations in Vandry and Casey (1925-1930) From 1925 to 1930, the company Veillet & Fr√®res Limit√©e is committed to contracts with the Belgian logging and Consolidated Paper in the areas of: Casey (1926), Vandry (1926), Cannes (1926) and Manjobeques (1927 only). Forestry Operations on \\"La li√®vre\\" (the Hare) river (1930-1947) At the height of operations of Veillet & Fr√®res Limit√©e in the area of \\"La li√®vre\\" (the Hare) river, between 3000 and 3500 employed workers were assigned to the timber industries. The work of cutting wood was distributed among 45-50 forestry contractors. Following the death of Jeffrey Veillet, which occurred in 1946, Consolidated Paper has taken over directly logging. Company Veillet & Fr√®res was dissolved in 1947.Marie-Claire Veillette Martel (Hervey-Jonction, QC), article \\"Des jeunes Veillette √† la cueillette de bleuets (myrtilles) en 1945\\" (Young Veillette picking blueberries (bilberries) in 1945), Bulletin Le Pathiskan (July 1993) published by \\"L'Association des familles Veillet/te d'Am√©rique\\", p. 11-13, recounting a visit to the lumber camps of \\"La Li√®vre\\" (the Hare). Forestry Operations in Talbot (1937-1940) In the winter of 1937-38 Veillet & Fr√®res Limit√©e has made the logging of \\"pitounes\\" in Talbot sector. It built a logging camp located at about 3 km from the railway; this camp remained inoperative for a year. Then work resumed intensely from June to August 1939 to make a cut of 25,000 cords of peeled wood. Forestry operations in Talbot (Linton area) ceased in spring 1940. A secondary railway road had been built for loading the timber cut in \\"pitounes\\" (logs of 4 feet long). Municipal politics In municipal politics, Jeffrey Veillette was at first a board member of the municipality of the village of Sainte-Th√®cle, then mayor from 1919. In addition, from 1921 to 1925, he had accumulated as the office of mayor of the municipality of the parish of Sainte-Th√®cle.

Kyle was perhaps best remembered for his starring roles in the turn of the century plays Way Down East, Nathan Hale and John Ermine of the Yellowstone. Early life Born Howard Anderson Vandergrift at Shullsburg, Wisconsin, Kyle was the son of Captain Howard Vandergrift, a veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War who later served during the American Civil war as the first commander of the Shullsburg Light Guard, later known as Company I, Third Regiment Wisconsin Volunteers. Kyle was later raised in Mt. Carroll, Illinois where his father may have been a proprietor of H. & C. Vandergrift, a general merchandising store. Kyle attended the Mt. Carroll Union School, where he studied Latin and philosophy and was named valedictorian of the 1879 graduating class. At home Kyle received private instructions in French and literature and after high school studied law for two years. By his early teens Kyle had won an oration competition and acquired a keen interest in the works of William Shakespeare. He began his acting career in amateur theatre as Kyle Vandergrift and made his professional stage debut at the age of 23 under the name Howard Kyle.Hanaford, Harry Prescott & Hines, Dixie Who's Who in Music and Drama, 1914, pp. 187‚Äì188 Retrieved August 4, 2013Howard Kyle Dies, Veteran of the Stage.

During the mid-1890s Kyle played leading man roles with stock companies in Salt Lake City, Pittsburg and San Francisco. In late 1897 Kyle began a two-year run at the Manhattan Theatre and national tour of the Grismer and Parker pastoral play Way Down East, playing David Bartlett to Phoebe Davies' Anna Moore. During the season of 1900/01 he played the title role in a successful tour of the Clyde Fitch romantic drama Nathan Hale, with co-star Nanette Comstock as Alice Adams. Kyle was Sir Jasper Thorndyke, the lead character in a 1904 tour of Louis Parker's four-act comedy, Rosemary, and the next year played the title role in a tour of Louis Shipman's adaptation of the Frederic Remington western, John Ermine of the Yellowstone.

They were instrumental in bringing Bishop Jean Baptiste Pompallier to New Zealand and were involved in the growth of Catholicism and Catholic missions in the Hokianga and later on in the North Shore of Auckland. Early lives Thomas Poynton was born in Ballivor, County Meath, Ireland. In his earlier life he was educated in France and later convicted of \\"Whiteboyism\\". He was transported to Sydney in 1822. Later he met Mary Kennedy, who had been born in Sydney, and was also from an Irish Catholic background, and they married. Move to New Zealand In 1828, they moved to New Zealand. They were based in the Hokianga and lived in Papakawau. They still resided there at the time of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. They had three children, Mary Margaret (born 1830), Edward (born 1832) and Catherine (born 1836). There was no Catholic parish in New Zealand at the time so they travelled to Sydney to have their first two children baptised. In 1835 Thomas Poynton travelled to Sydney to ask for a Catholic priest to serve the Catholic community in New Zealand. In Rome the wheels had already been turning and in 1833 a decision had been made to appoint a Bishop to serve New Zealand and the surrounding Pacific Islands. Bishop Jean Baptiste Pompallier arrived 10 January 1838 and stayed at the home of Thomas and Mary Poynton until his own house was established in Kororareka. With the Poynton family in the congregation, Pompallier celebrated the first Mass in New Zealand on 13 January 1838 at Totara Point, Hokianga. Later life Thomas Poynton had made a very good income from the timber industry as a sawmill owner in the Hokianga. Later on Thomas and Mary Poynton owned a large amount of land in Takapuna and donated some of it to Bishop Pompallier in 1867. In 1899 a large Lot was purchased by the Sisters of Mercy from Catherine Shea, the youngest of the Poynton children. The land owned by the Sisters of Mercy would eventually be used to build two Catholic schools, St Joseph's Takapuna and Carmel College Catholic girls school which sits on the edge of Lake Pupuke in Milford. Thomas and Mary Poynton are both buried in O'Neill's Point Cemetery on Auckland's North Shore. Legacy On the North Shore there is a Crescent named after Mary Poynton and there is a large retirement facility on Shakespeare Road named \\"The Poynton\\" after the family who had originally owned the land it is built on.

Overview The Uruguayan savanna ecoregion used to be covered by grasslands, palm savannas, and gallery forests along the Uruguay, Negro, Yaguar√≠, Queguay, and Tacuaremb√≥ rivers. Unfortunately, agriculture and cattle ranching have heavily altered these natural communities. The savannas are critically endangered because there are few small isolated patches of intact habitat remaining. The whole ecoregion has been severely altered by cattle ranching, one of the main pillars of the national economy in Uruguay. About 80% of Uruguayan territory is used for cattle ranching on natural and artificial savannas.Uruguay - Encyclopedia of Earth Current issues = Pollution of Drinking Water = Santa Lucia River The Santa Lucia River, could be the body of water that provides over 60% of Uruguayans with their tap water, has experienced a significant decline in quality since 2014. Increased dumping from agricultural companies into the sanitary system raised the amount of toxic waste in the water, and the decrease in rain does not allow the dilution of this waste to occur. Excessive amounts of fertilizers, the dumping of cesspit waste and wastewater treatment plants working to only half of their capacity are also large factors in the pollution of this basin. The excess of phosphorus in the water is too much to be consumed by phytoplankton (who keep the ecosystem balanced), therefore ends up ruining the water and helps develop cyanobacterias, that pollute drinking water. Most of the waste that is dumped into the basins helps to produce this excess of phosphorus. A study has shown that those children who have water filters in their homes, get better grades in school, no matter their social- economic standing. 30% of children in Uruguay have excessive levels of lead in their systems, due to it being in their tap waterhttp://www.espectador.com/sociedad/330057/el-rio-santa-lucia-esta-en- estado-de-permanente-alarma = Livestock and its effect on water = Cattle Farm in Uruguay Worldwide, Livestock production is one of the fastest growing agricultural industries. Uruguay has a long history with livestock productions, with 70-80% of the land being devoted to pastures, both natural and cultivated; and since 1960, the production has doubled. This puts an increased pressure on the grasslands, and with the soil quality decreasing, fertilizers need to be used to combat this void. But this has consequences; the increase in production can cause the crops to drain the local water supply, as it is required for irrigation and this makes it difficult for other plants to grow. In addition to this, large areas of forests have been cleared out to create new farmland, to grow food to feed the increasing number of cattle. Excess fertilizer use can cause eutrophication of the aquatic ecosystems, when the excess fertilizers are washed into streams or ponds, it leads explosive growth of algae, which in any stagnant waters may cause oxygen levels to drop and making the water uninhabitable to most of the organisms. = Deforestation = Forestry is one of the largest growing industries in the country, which has affected the fertility of Uruguayan meadows. Over 10% of Uruguay's forest has been destroyed, yet with the Forestation law implemented in 1988 there have been some restrictions as to how the private sector is able to operate, by not allowing them to cut an excess of trees.http://www.sice.oas.org/investment/NatLeg/URY/L_Forestal_s.pdf = Pulp Mills = Botnia was established in Fray Bentos in 2006. It meets all of the environmental requisites proposed by the IFC and the MIGA. It was also shown how Botnia would in fact help the city of Fray Bentos‚Äô sanitary system by putting their waste through Botnia‚Äôs filters. Botnia was sold to UPM in 2009, and they have now also taken the production of biomass energy into their products. = Afforestation = An area of recently harvested plantation. Uruguay is a country consisting mostly of prairie land, with only 3.6% of it being high forest.\\"Afforestation in Uruguay: Study of a changed landscape\\" Afforestation is when trees are planted to create new forest areas. But the main problem is the introduction of new non-indigenous species in the process, which, in some areas, are in competition with the local species. Large areas of the prairie land have been converted into forest, mainly for agro forestry, and large quantities of pesticides and herbicides are used to keep the trees from getting affected by pests and weeds, and when these trees are harvested, the land becomes bare, which creates a fire hazard. Afforestation has been further accelerated by the demand for wood by the pulp mills, adding the damage. The introduction of the new forests may also fragment the existing the native forests, thus affecting the genetic diversity through a process of allopatric separation. = Heavy Metal Pollution = Montevideo Harbour Heavy metal pollution in Uruguay can be illustrated by the pollution in Montevideo Harbour, a part of the Montevideo Bay, covering an area of around 12 km2, and a part of the R√¨o de la Plata estuary. The bay has an average depth of 5 m and a micro tidal environment, with the wind controlling the hydrodynamics. Untreated waste from the municipalities upstream; as well as industrial discharges from the petrochemical industry, and thermoelectric power plant flow into the bay. It is also the recipient of the water of Pantanoso and Miguelete, two streams with excessive pollutants present in them. Unregulated discharge has led to high level of heavy metals (Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ag and Hg) and hydrocarbons accumulating in the water, and these high levels can have horrible environmental effects, as well as causing harm to humans. The heavy metals usually end up settling at the bottom with the sediment, or getting taken up by marine organisms. Although marine organisms require trace amount of the heavy mental ion for their normal body functioning, the excess amounts of the heavy metals found in the bay and the surrounding R√¨o de la Plata estuary, resulted in the build-up of their concentration in the muscle, and liver tissues of the fish.\\" Heavy Metal Levels in Fish from Coastal Waters of Uruguay. Environmental \\" The contamination then travels up the food chains, from one organism to another, thus affecting wide range of organisms, and greatly increasing the concentrations with each trophic level, in the process called biomagnification. Humans, by virtue of being high in the food chain, may find in their food, the concentration of the heavy metals, exceed their natural demand, by orders of magnitude resulting in the range of bio-toxic effects on the body. Although some steps have been taken by the government of Uruguay, to assess the heavy metals in the aquatic environment; the effects of its impact on fish and many other members of marine biota have largely been ignored.  Energy  56.5% of electric energy in Uruguay comes from renewable sources of energy, including solar, hydro, wind and biomass. The other 43.5% belongs to non-renewable sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. This ratio is rapidly changing as UTE (Uruguay's State Electricity Department) and other private companies are developing numerous projects to change towards cleaner energy. The Global Economic Crisis of 2008 made many of the materials to produce renewable energy cheaper, therefore Uruguay decided it would be the best time to develop their clean energy sector, heavily investing in 2011 and 2012. This has helped increase the country's output immediately. These projects are all developed by the Uruguayan Energy Policies of 2005-2030. = Wind Energy = Wind turbines in Tacuaremb√≥ Department 22% of electric energy is produced by wind power. By 2017, they believe that number will grow to 38%, which would mean second in the world to only Denmark. In only 10 years, Uruguay has been able to develop its wind power helping the hydroelectric energy situation that has seen itself in constant decline due to the increasing droughts in the region. In 2005, Uruguay had no electricity generated by wind whatsoever, in 2015 its output was of over 580 megawatts, and it is predicted that the country will be generating over 2000 megawatts, becoming a world leader in wind energy. Due to its very flat terrain, Uruguay has a very constant and stable wind power. Uruguayan wind energy generates from 40% to 50% of full capacity, that is if the turbines were constantly moving at full potential. On the other hand, American wind energy generates only 34% of its full capacity. The entire wind energy project is set to cost 3 billion dollars. = Solar Energy = Uruguay is aiming to develop solar energy in the near future. A private entity called Tecnova Renovables has a solar power plant that now provides the equivalent of the electrical consumption of 100 homes. The government is also developing plans for solar power.http://www.elpais.com.uy/economia/noticias/primer-planta-energia-solar- privada.html The fact that it is very unpredictable is the reason why the government remains suspect in investing large amounts of money in this energy source. = Hydro Energy = Salto Grande Dam Hydroelectric energy used to produce over half of the sustainable electrical energy for Uruguay. The largest dams are located on the Uruguay River, the biggest being the Salto Grande Dam. Two more dams will be built in Uruguay, without the moving of any housing or population.http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/us-millones- construir-represas.html Even though these two dams are being constructed, the country intends to move away from hydroelectric energy because of climate change. More and more droughts affect the region and becoming too dependent on these dams has forced Uruguay to purchase great amounts of fossil fuels from other countries to produce electricity. = Biomass Energy = Uruguay possesses very developed foresting, cattle and agriculture industries. From being practically nonexistent in 2004, only generating 1% of the electric energy of the South American country, it reached an all time high in 2014, achieving 13%. The two main agencies that create this energy source are UPM and Montes del Plata, two pulp mills that are taking great awareness in taking care of the environment. Agencies The main state agency in charge of the environment is the National Directorate for the Environment (, DINAMA) which is part of the Ministry of Housing, Territorial Planning and Environment.DINAMA Green parties Green politics did not set roots in Uruguay for a long time. In the 1989 election the Green Eto-Ecologist Party obtained 0.5% of the popular vote; in general, environmental organizations have had low political significance, often as part of other bigger parties. In the 2014 election a new political group is taking part, the Ecologist Radical Intransigent Party. Led by Cesar Vega, they preach on the preservation of natural resources and are against open-pit mining.

Jaffe (1925‚Äì1978) was a vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and founder of what is now the Guttmacher Institute. He was an advocate for increasing the availability of family planning services in the United States. Through his publications and consultations Jaffe argued for birth control as a matter of health and human rights. He was instrumental in developing public support for federal financing of family planning programs, among them the landmark Title X of the Public Health Service Act, passed by Congress in 1970.Title X of the Public Health Service Act (Public Law 91-572 Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs). For his contributions to public health Jaffe was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences in September 1977. Life Jaffe was born in Queens, New York City on November 27, 1925, and died of a heart attack on August 16, 1978 in New York City. After service in the Army Air Force (1944‚Äì1946), he completed his bachelor's degree in Economics at Queens College in 1947.The Washington Post, 8/18/1978 Subsequently establishing himself as a journalist, he then joined the Planned Parenthood Federation of America as associate director of its Information and Education Department, later becoming Vice President for Program Planning and Development. In 1968 he established the Center for Family Planning Program Development, the research and public policy arm of PPFA, along with Dr. Alan Guttmacher, then president of PPFA. The organization was named after Guttmacher in 1974, with Jaffe as President, and spun off from Planned Parenthood in 1977. Jaffe also consulted with other organizations, among them the National Center for Health Statistics, the National Institutes of Health, the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, and the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.Planned Parenthood- World Population Washington Memo, 9/1/1978 He was posthumously awarded the Margaret Sanger Award, Planned Parenthood's highest award, in 1978 and The Carl S. Shultz Award for Lifetime Achievement from the American Public Health Association. Upon the latter presentation, the Population Section of the APHA passed the following resolution: :\\"The Population Section of the APHA records its deep sorrow over the untimely passing of Frederick S. Jaffe, President of The Alan Guttmacher Institute. Mr. Jaffe, both through his organization and as an individual, was instrumental in the conceptualization of a national family planning program and in its later development and implementation. The Alan Guttmacher Institute, which he founded, reflects Mr. Jaffe's commitment to the production and use of the requisite research and analysis for making informed decisions about fertility-related services and domestic population policies. :\\"Mr. Jaffe's death is a loss not only to those of us in the population and family planning field but also in the public health arena at large. He worked tirelessly to insure that all people regardless of income, age, race, sex or residence have full access to the reproductive health and social services to which they are entitled.\\" The Jaffe Memo In recent years a 1969 memo written by Jaffe has been a source of controversy on the Internet. The memo, written to Bernard Berelson, head of the Population Council, included a table that summarized many proposals from various sources regarding population control. This memo has been cited to accuse Jaffe and Planned Parenthood of supporting such measures as compulsory abortions and sterilizations, which were among the proposals referenced. In fact, the table was a listing of current proposals, with sources documented, not the policies of Planned Parenthood. The original memo is available online.

It is supported by over 450 cerebral palsy service organisations, universities, parent groups, research institutions, student groups, schools and children's hospitals from 65 countries. The first World CP Day campaign was called 'Change My World in 1 Minute'. The project sought ideas from the global community of people with CP for technologies and products that needed inventing - that had the potential to 'change the world' for people living with CP. In 2012, more than 470 ideas were posted on the World CP Day website. Three ideas were shortlisted and then the call went out to inventors. A research team from the University of Virginia (USA) won the major prize. They developed a prototype solar powered wheelchair which was an idea posted by Alper Sirvan, a man with cerebral palsy in Turkey. The wheelchair prototype was presented to Alper on World CP Day 2013. In 2015, the campaign evolved into a social movement that targets the six key issues that affect people with CP around the world, irrespective of geographical, cultural and economic differences.

St Julian's obituary records that he was born in France but other sources suggest London in 1818. He claimed to be the son of Thomas St Julian, French army officer, and his wife Marian, n√©e Blackwell. However, the Australian academic, Marion Diamond, in her biography of St Julian, claims that he deliberately obscured his origins and that it is likely that his real name was Charles Trout and that his initial training was as a wood and ivory carver. St Julian emigrated to Adelaide in 1837, proceeding in 1839 to Sydney, where he wrote for The Australasian Chronicle, and subsequently for the Commercial Journal and Advertiser. In 1843 he joined the staff of The Sydney Morning Herald, which he left four years later for The Sydney Chronicle, afterwards known as the Free Press. In 1849 he rejoined The Sydney Morning Herald. St Julian participated in municipal politics, serving on the Waverley council in 1860 and as its chairman in 1861. He went on to serve as an alderman on the Marrickville Borough Council from 1868 to 1871, and as Mayor from 1868-1869 and again in 1871. In February 1870, he became a magistrate. In 1849, St Julian was appointed the Hawaiian Kingdom's Consul in Sydney by King Kamehameha III and Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Crichton Wyllie. On August 4, 1853, he was appointed as \\"His Majesty's Commissioner, and Political and Commercial Agent to the Kings, Chiefs and Rulers of the Islands in the Pacific Ocean, not under the protection or sovereignty of any European Government\\". In 1859, he was appointed as \\"His Hawaiian Majesty's Charg√© d'Affaires and Consul General to the Kings and Ruling Chiefs of the Independent States and Tribes in Polynesia South of the Equator\\". Corresponding with Wylie on many grandiose ideas to extend Hawaii's power in Oceania, he accomplished nothing significant but later inspired King KalƒÅkaua's vision of a Polynesian confederacy in the 1880s. St. Julian remained as Law Reporter for the Herald until 1872, when King Seru Epenisa Cakobau appointed him Chief Justice of Fiji. When Fiji became a British colony in 1874, Governor Sir Hercules Robinson proposed an annual pension of ¬£200 for him, but he died near Levuka, Fiji on 26 November 1874. Personal life St Julian was a Roman Catholic. He married Eleanor Heffernan at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, on 26 November 1839. She died on 28 August 1861. On 10 January 1863, he remarried, to Eliza Winifred Hawkesley, the daughter of the radical editor of the People's Advocate and New South Wales Vindicator, Edward John Hawksley. Altogether, he had fifteen children ‚Äî nine with Eleanor and six with Eliza.

Early life Hatata was born in Egypt on 13 September 1923 to an Egyptian father,Botman, 1988, p. 50. Fathallah Hetata Pasha,Baraka, 1998, p. 242. and an English mother.Botman, 1988, p. 51. His father was a Western-educated, feudal landowner, and his family was upper middle class. Hatata, who was raised in his home village in the Nile Delta region, was taught little about agriculture, the sector his family relied on for income. In his 20s, Hatata became appalled at the impoverished conditions in which the fellahin that worked his father's lands lived and expressed resentment that he was \\"the heir of feudalism and one of its sons.\\"Baraka, 1998, p. 243. Activism In the years immediately following World War II, Hatata was invited and accepted to join Iskra, one of Egypt's major communist movements, founded in 1942 by Hillel Schwartz.Botman, 1988, p. 47. Hatata cited his reasoning for joining Iskra because the left- wing movement in Egypt in general was \\"progressive, open, ... wasn't traditional or fanatical,\\" while other ideological movements seemed predicated on \\"emotional patriotism.\\" In 1947 Iskra merged into Democratic Movement for National Liberation (DMNL). In 1948, Hatata was arrested by the authorities during an anti-communist crackdown by the monarchist authorities.Botman, 1988, pp. 70-72. He was released after the monarchy was overthrown by a group of revolutionary officers in July 1952. Following the 1952 revolution, he became a member of the Voice of the Peasants newspaper's editorial board.Botman, 1988, p. 80. When two of Hatata's DMNL comrades escaped detention, they fled and temporarily stayed at Hatata's home. Hatata was under police surveillance at the time and upon learning of it, the three left for the house of another released DMNL comrade. However, they were tracked down and arrested. Hatata and dozens of other communists were released during Gamal Abdel Nasser's presidency in April 1964. Upon his release, Hatata was among some of the ex- DMNL members who believed Egyptian communists could united with Nasser's Arab Socialist Union (ASU), the only official party in the country. They viewed it as a progressive and socialist movement.Nelson, 2000, pp. 170-171. Nasser grew critical of the ASU at the time, claiming it was falling short of mentoring \\"socialist democracy\\" in Egypt. In December 1964, the ASU leadership was reorganized with the establishment of a 16-member secretariat-general, of which six were original communists, including Hatata.Ginat, 2013, pp. 26-27. Family Hatata was married to the prominent Egyptian feminist writer Nawal El Saadawi until 2010; the couple met in 1964. They lived in Cairo, but built a small house in Hatata's home village where they traveled to a number of times a year. The couple has one son, Atef, who is a film director in Egypt.

Etymology Silver Lake was named after the nearby lake of the same name, so named for its clear water, although there is another legend that an attempt was made to locate a silver mine near the lake. The post office name was written Silver Lake (1876-1895; Silverlake 1896-1910; and Silver Lake since 1910). The change was doubtless suggested by postal authorities, who prefer single names, but custom triumphed over law and the two words are used.State Historical Society of Missouri: Perry County http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_perry.html  History  Lead was mined in the location of Silver Lake in 1883 and some silver was found, though not in paying quantities.

The parish first started as a log cabin mission church served by the Vincentians from Perryville, Missouri in the 1855. The first frame church was built in 1865, under William Vincent Moore, C.M. In the early 1870s, Father Joseph Hellwing, who had just become pastor of St. Mary's at Biehle, Missouri, also gave services here. Father William Vincent Moore, C.M., a local Missouri native, who studied both at St. Mary's of the Barrens Seminary and later in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, also served there. The stone church was constructed under direction of Father Denis D. Leyden, C. M. in 1877-79 of unique colored stone blocks, and was known as Holy Innocents. The brothers and students at St. Mary's of the Barrens donated 30,000 shingles for the roof of the new church. The Silver Lake church was changed to St. Rose of Lima, in 1885-1886, under Father Pommer and Father E. J.

The episode aired on August 12, 2013. Plot At night, Junior (Alexander Koch) comes home but Big Jim (Dean Norris) points a gun at him and tells him to leave. The next morning, Big Jim confronts Ollie (Leon Rippy) and gets Barbie (Mike Vogel), Linda (Natalie Martinez), Junior and a volunteer (Jimmy Gonzalez) to take the well from Ollie. However, when they arrive, a number of Ollie's men with guns appear and shoot the volunteer in the leg. Junior then betrays his father and joins Ollie's side. While Jim is rounding up volunteers to attack Ollie's farm, Barbie and Linda plan to blow the well up so that the other wells' water is returned. Barbie tries to get Big Jim's approval, but he refuses. Meanwhile, Norrie (Mackenzie Lintz) blames Joe (Colin Ford) for finding the mini-dome and breaks up with him. Joe then tells Julia (Rachelle Lefevre) about the mini-dome and the egg, and they both go to see it. When they arrive the egg is glowing pink. Julia touches the dome and another Joe appears, saying, \\"the monarch will be crowned.\\" Joe thinks this means that something bad will happen to him. Junior finds out from Ollie that the car crash in which his mother died was not an accident but a suicide. Junior then asks Ollie not to kill Jim, because he wants to. Before Big Jim and the volunteers attack, Barbie sneaks into Ollie's farm, builds a bomb and attaches it to the well. At night, Big Jim, Linda, Phil (Nicholas Strong), and others attack the farm. Jim then realizes that Barbie is missing and attacks early. During the battle, five people are killed, and Phil is shot in the shoulder. Just before he detonates the bomb, Barbie is caught, but manages to overcome his attacker and destroys the well. As everyone realizes that the well has been destroyed, Junior appears and knocks out Jim with his gun. Angie (Britt Robertson) and Norrie bond, and she talks Norrie into getting back together with Joe. Norrie then tells Joe that she is ready to bury her mother, Alice (Samantha Mathis), who died in the previous episode. Big Jim is dragged into Ollie's living room and Ollie's men leave now that there is no well to protect. Ollie leaves Junior to kill Big Jim but instead he asks Jim about his mother. Ollie returns and aims his gun at Jim, but Junior shoots and kills Ollie. Big Jim and Junior then reconcile but part ways. Big Jim is later confronted by Barbie, with Barbie saying how fewer people could have died had they gone with his plan. At the police station, Linda is surprised to see Junior, who tells her what happened and that the cell is his home. At Julia's house, Julia asks Barbie if he knows what the other Joe meant but he says no while Angie's tattoo of a butterfly on her shoulder is seen. Production Executive producer Neal Baer said with TV Guide regarding Big Jim and the events of the previous episode that \\"Boomer and Ollie were preventing the town from getting access to water, so was Big Jim being evil or was he doing this to save the town?

History of Igbara-Oke Igbara-Oke, a nodal town that is located on a mountain top, with a panegyric, \\"Omo Eleye Ti N Ke Weye\\". A town that has never lost any battle, and has never been conquered by any town during the inter-tribal war. According to the historian, it was reported that the then Oba of Ilesa sent emissaries headed by Ogedengbe to Olowa when they heard of the performances of Igbara-Oke at the war. Every town and domain has their history, and where they started or migrated from. The history of Igbara-Oke could be traced back to the fifteenth century, when they migrated from Ile- Ife, under the hierarachical supervision of Olowa Arajaka and his children, Alarelu and Adeyiba, who were then known as brave warriors. Olowa Arajaka was known as OLOWA AJAKA, the son of Obanifon, the sixth Ooni of Ife, who was the first Oba to use beaded Crown. When Olowa Arajaka left with his two sons, they left with a crown given to them by Obanifon, as well as the sword of Alayere, Igba-Ifa, guns and some farm implements. Although, they stopped and stayed briefly at numbers of places before they arrived at the present day Igbara- Oke. Amongst the places they stopped were present day Ilesa, Alaaye, Igbo Onigbagbara, Onikolo. They later settled temporarily at Olowinrin for thirteen years. At Olowinrin, Arajaka, the leader of the group gave birth to twins, Alarelu and Adeyiba. The people at that time suffered great disaster at Olowinrin. An epidemic broke out and claim the lives of Olowa Arajaka and other people. This disease forced the people to leave Olowinrin, and went in two different directions. Alarelu and his group departed South wards of Olowinrin to Odo-Oko, which later became Igbara-Odo, while Adeyigba went upwards to Oke-Oko, which later became Igbara-Oke. The name Igbara was gotten from a forest called \\"Aigbara\\" where Adeyiba was born. The forest also contains a kind of leave called \\"Ewe Aigbara\\" that serves as herbs to cure diseases during that time. When the two brothers parted ways to settle at different domain, Alarelu, the elder son took the name \\"Arajaka\\", and his brother, Adeyiba chose to bear \\"Olowa\\" from their father's name, OLOWA ARAJAKA. That is why we have Arajaka in Igbara-Odo and Olowa in Igbara-Oke. Adeyiba later became the first king of Igbara-Oke, and he divided the town into six quarters, with a Principal Chief as the head of each quarters. These six chiefs also have minor chiefs under them who were given responsibilities for conflict resolutions, peace, security, and sacrifices to the gods and welfare matters. The general believe that Oluji was the first Oba of Igbara- Oke is very untrue. Oluji came to Igbara-Oke for hunting. Oba Adeyigba gave birth to three children, namely, Oberubese, Ogidi and Aruogbon. After Oba Adeyiba, different Olowa from the three ruling houses, Oberubese, Ogidi and Aruogbon have ascended the throne. The Olowas that have ascended the throne are: 1\\\\. Oba Adeyiba Aboaba 2\\\\. Oba Otete Obaji 3\\\\. Oba Agbonyin Lamuditokun 4\\\\. Oba Ojodu Agan Oberubese 5\\\\. Oba Aruogbon Adekoye 6\\\\. Oba Fatile 7\\\\. Oba Adejuri Ogidi I 8\\\\. Oba Faleke Aropupa Biodide 9\\\\.

However, the reign of all these Obas have been highly significant and they played prominent role in rural development, social and economic integration. For the record, the Olowa of Igbara-Oke is one of the 54 recognised kings in Yoruba land that wears beaded crown, as prescribed by the Ooni of Ife in which was documented in the 1902 Federal Republic of Nigeria Gazette.

History The Manhattan and Queens Traction Company was originally part of the South Shore Traction Company based in Sayville, New York. The company was established in 1903 as a horsecar service, and built two lines; both of which began at Sayville Railroad Station. One line ran from Railroad Avenue down to Montauk Highway and then to Candee Road towards the Great South Bay. The other ran from the station to Middle Road through Bayport then turned north Oakwood Avenue, then east along the south side of the Long Island Rail Road Montauk Branch onto Railroad Street which served Bayport LIRR Station. Railroad Street becomes Maple Street in Blue Point, and the trolley that ran along it turned north onto Blue Point Avenue where it momentarily connected to Blue Point station before reaching Montauk Highway. Their original plans were far more ambitious. Besides a line running east into Patchogue, they were proposing a cross island trolley line, which was intended to run north through Bohemia, Lake Ronkonkoma, Saint James, Stony Brook, Setauket, East Setauket, and finally Port Jefferson. Beyond that it also planned to build lines through Nassau and Queens Counties, as part of their charter to connect to all the lines on Long Island, mostly along the South Shore. As part of the effort to do so, it acquired and operated a line across the Queensboro Bridge from Manhattan to Long Island City. However, it was unable to break through the monopoly of the LIRR-held lines in Nassau County such as the New York and Long Island Traction Company, as well as local litigation. The railroad sold off its original two lines to the Suffolk Traction Company, and moved to Long Island City in 1912, re-chartering themselves as the Manhattan and Queens Transportation Company. The main line of the M&QT; was that line along the Queensboro Bridge, but it was expanded into Woodside, Elmhurst, Forest Hills, and finally Jamaica by 1914. The terminus in Jamaica was largely due to trackage rights with the Brooklyn Rapid Transit subsidiary known as the Brooklyn, Queens County and Suburban Railroad. This was officially known as the Queens Boulevard Line. Other than this, it contained a short industrial track along Van Dam Street in Long Island City, and a slight extension south of Jamaica Station that was to be part of a never-completed southern extension. The last trolleys of the M&QT; ran in 1937. The company converted itself into the Manhattan and Queens Bus Corporation, running the line as the Q60 bus and was bought out by Green Bus Lines in 1943.

No. 4014 was part of the first group of 20 Big Boys, classified as 4884-1. Designed to haul trains over Utah's Wasatch Range, No. 4014 and the 24 other Big Boys routinely pulled trains of up to . No. 4014's last routine repairs took place in 1956. No. 4014 completed its final revenue run on July 21, 1959, just hours before the last revenue run by any Big Boy. It had traveled during its twenty years of revenue service. Union Pacific retired No. 4014 on December 7, 1961. All of the Big Boys were retired by 1962, their duties assumed by diesel locomotives and gas turbine-electric locomotives (GTELs). That same year, Union Pacific donated No. 4014 to the Southern California chapter of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society in Pomona, California, where it became one of the eight Big Boys preserved around the United States. =Ownership transfer (2012-2014)= SD70Ms Nos. 4014 and 4884 haul Big Boy No. 4014 over the Cajon Pass to Cheyenne, Wyoming, for restoration. In late 2012, Union Pacific officials announced that they would obtain a Big Boy locomotive, restore it to operating condition, and use it in excursion service. On July 23, 2013, the Southern California chapter of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society agreed to transfer No. 4014 back to Union Pacific. On November 14, 2013, No. 4014 began its journey to the UP Steam Shop in Cheyenne. It was pulled from its display site at the museum, on temporary track, to the adjacent parking lot. On January 26, 2014, No. 4014 was pulled from the Los Angeles County Fairplex to the Covina station on Metrolink trackage by No. 1996, an SD70ACe diesel locomotive painted in Southern Pacific colors. It presently arrived at UP's West Colton Yard in Bloomington, California, where it sat on display until April 28, when it began its journey to Cheyenne. After arriving at the Steam Shop's roundhouse on May 8, No. 4014 sat largely idle for two years while the UP steam crew worked to overhaul No. 844. The Steam Shop also used the time to expand and upgrade its facilities to accommodate a Big Boy. =Restoration (2016-2019)= One of No. 4014's driving wheels on the lathe at the Strasburg Rail Road's workshop in 2017 In August 2016, UP officials announced that restoration work on No. 4014 had begun under Heritage Fleet Operations director Ed Dickens. By early 2017, the locomotive had been completely disassembled. Some new parts were fabricated, including the rod brasses, top boiler check valve, and lubricator check valves. The driving wheels were sent to be repaired by the Strasburg Rail Road in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. The work included one major alteration: converting the coal-burning locomotive to run on No. 5 fuel oil. This was done by replacing the firebox grates with a fire pan and an oil burner. This made No. 4014 the first Big Boy to undergo a coal-to-oil conversion since No. 4005, which ran on oil from 1946 until it was converted back to coal in 1948 due to uneven heating in its large, single-burner firebox. No. 4014's old firebox grates were saved and sent for the restoration of Milwaukee Road No. 261. In March 2018, it was reported that the process of putting the locomotive back together had begun; ten months later, the locomotive's restoration was nearly finished. In December 2018, Union Pacific asked the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to exempt UP Nos. 4014, 844 and 3985 from federal Positive Train Control (PTC) requirements; in February 2019, the FRA officials responded that such waivers were not needed. On February 6, 2019, No. 4014's boiler passed a hydrostatic test. The locomotive was successfully test fired on April 9. Around 9 p.m. on May 1, it moved under its own power for the first time in more than 59 years. The following evening, the locomotive made its first test run from Cheyenne to Nunn, Colorado. =Excursion service (2019-present)= First run of UP 4014 in May 2019, en route to the Ogden Heritage Festival Upon the completion of the restoration, No. 4014 joined the railroad's No. 844 in excursion service. No. 4014 also became the world's largest operational steam locomotive, displacing (and eventually replacing) No. 3985. In May 2019, No. 4014 made its first excursion run amid the celebrations marking 150 years since the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad. Following its May 4 christening at the Cheyenne Depot Museum, the locomotive ‚Äî along with No. 844 ‚Äî traveled to Ogden, Utah. No. 4014 subsequently made two additional tours on its own, with the first tour taking it through the Midwestern United States from July 8 to August 8, 2019 and the second tour taking it through the Southwestern United States from September 27 to November 26. Incidents * On May 16, 2019, No. 4014 partially derailed, with two axles from one set of drive wheels falling into the gauge, while entering the yard at Rawlins, Wyoming; the derailed drive wheels were returned to the rails within three hours.

The piece been performed by many taiko ensembles, and became well-known through dramatic variations of the piece developed by Ondekoza and Kodo. Yatai-bayashi has been recognized as a piece that requires great physical endurance. History Yatai-bayashi actually began as a somewhat different piece called , which is intended for a festival performance, rather than a stage performance. Chichibu Yatai-bayashi is normally played during a festival in Chichibu, Japan that occurs annually from December 3‚Äì4. More recently however, this particular arrangement has also been adopted for local performances on stage. In 1972, members of the taiko group Ondekoza spent only one week in Chichibu in order to learn the piece from festival participants and adapt it for their future performances. In addition to the short time they had to learn the piece, there was difficulty in how folk music of this kind was usually taught: Chichibu players did not conceptualize the piece in terms of its underlying beat structure. Instead, these rhythms were memorized and even contained an element of improvisation from player to player. Ondekoza could not replicate the local techniques, so the piece was substantially changed so they were able to play it. In an interview with Ondekoza founder Eitetsu Hayashi, he said, \\"We were really bad drummers and we knew that the only way we could show we were trying our best was to speed the piece up.\\" To make the performance more dramatic, players leaned farther back from the drum and a decrescendo-crescendo section was implemented. It was also the first ensemble piece that Ondekoza mastered together. Ondekoza's arrangement of the piece was adopted broadly across Japan However, with these changes and others, it has been argued that this version of Yatai-bayashi is substantially different enough that it lacks the local nuance of the original from Chichibu. Performance structure Although there are variations in how the piece is performed, Yatai-bayashi traditionally has at least five players: Two players on shime-daiko, one on ch≈´-daiko, one fue player, and one kane player. Contemporary versions of the piece have used multiple ch≈´-daiko to create an effect similar to a round. Performance of Yatai-bayashi is considered strenuous and requires considerable physical endurance. In the original version that is performed for the festival in Chichibu, players are actually performing inside a festival float, called a yatai. They cannot be seen from the outside, and serve to direct and support those carrying the float. A single chu-daiko player begins playing a complex rhythm on a horizontally mounted drum that is low to the ground. The player is seated and leaning back while playing the drum as their legs are extended across the length of it. When the chu-daiko player is finished, another player switches with them and repeats the rhythm. In the version developed by Ondekoza, the piece begins with two shime-daiko players playing the background, and soon after, a single and lead chu-daiko player begins playing the main rhythmic pattern. After going through this pattern twice, the next chu-daiko player begins while the first player fades out. This sequence is also repeated by the second player when the third chu-daiko player begins. When the third player completes the rhythm, the lead chu-daiko player transfers to a shime-daiko to perform a solo. When the solo is completed, the player returns to the chu-daiko, and all three players perform the main rhythm in unison to end the piece.

G. 2010. Elasticity in the ‚Äúrules‚Äù of the game: Exploring organizational expedience. Human Relations, 63(5): 701‚Äì730. There are several key aspects underlying the concept of organizational expedience. Firstly, organizational expedience describes a worker‚Äôs actions but not their intentions. For example, if a shop assistant is considering giving a loyal customer a deeper discount than is permitted but decides not to do so after seeing her supervisor, then this shop assistant didn‚Äôt engage in expedience. Secondly, such definition requires workers to knowingly engage in expedience. If the rules are not known or well understood, or are accidentally broken, this behavior doesn‚Äôt qualify as expedience. For example, if a long haul driver drove over the time limit because he doesn‚Äôt know about the time limit rule, misunderstood the time limit rule, or forgot to look at the watch and accidentally broke the time limit rule, such behavior does not qualify as expedience.  Work characteristics that may lead to organizational expedience  McLean Parks, Ma, and Gallagher (2010) proposed three role stressors as the theoretical antecedents of organizational expedience: #Role conflict.

The album was released on September 3, 2013, by Epic Records and Streamline Records. It is the first album by Braxton in 13 years. The album was a success, debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart selling 114,000 copies. Even though plans for a re-release of the album with a full version of the song \\"She Did That\\" and a rap remix of \\"One on One Fun\\" in 2014 with additional songs were announced, the idea was eventually scrapped as Love and War was never re-published.  Singles  The album's title track \\"Love and War\\" was released on December 6, 2012 as the lead single from the album. On January 17, 2013, the music video was released for \\"Love and War\\". \\"Love and War\\" officially impacted US Rhythmic radio on March 26, 2013. On May 7, 2013, the second single \\"The One\\" was released. On May 30, 2013, the music video was released for \\"The One\\". \\" All The Way Home\\" was sent to Urban Mainstream radio on August 21, 2013 as the third single from the album. On October 17, 2013, a music video was released for \\"Hot Sugar\\". The music video for \\"All The Way Home\\" was released on December 4, 2013.On November 29, 2018 five years after the album release, a music video for ‚ÄúPieces‚Äù was released.  Commercial performance  The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 114,000. The album almost made number one but was beaten by Ariana Grande's Yours Truly, which sold 138,000 in its first week. Love and War also debuted at number two in digital sales, selling 51,000 copies, being beaten by Yours Truly once again. However, the album sold well physically, selling 63,000 and debuted at number one in physical sales (Yours Truly only sold 30,000 physically and debuted at number seven). In its second week, the album sold 35,000 more copies. In its third week, the album sold 20,000 more copies. In its fourth week, the album sold 14,000 more copies bringing its total album sales to 183,000. The album helped Braxton set the female record for longest time between an initial chart listing and a first number one on the US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart during the SoundScan era (from December 1992 to 2013). The record was previously held by Angie Stone, who waited eight years and two weeks (from 1999 to 2007).  Critical response  Love and War was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Andy Kellman of AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, saying \\"Indeed, Love and War plays out like it's designed to contend with the likes of Ciara, Rihanna, Trey Songz, and maybe even Keyshia Cole, rather than those who came up around the same time as Braxton. Slower, more atmospheric productions like 'Stay and Fight,' 'All the Way Home,' and 'Sound of Love' suit her the best and display her considerable skill ‚Äì by now, given some of the artists who have come and gone since 2000, she should have at least four albums in her past. The lighthearted numbers ‚Äì like the Keri Hilson castoff- level 'Tip Toe,' the mind-numbing 'Hot Sugar,' and the Mike Will knockoff strip-club track 'She Did That' ‚Äì are no match for the fully formed songs that seem rooted in Braxton's life experiences.\\" Kathy Iandoli of Vibe gave the album a positive review, saying \\"Love And War is at times all over the place, but that's perfectly fine. The project is beautifully crazy‚Äîexactly what we've come to know and love from Tamar Braxton. It took a dose of reality TV to bring us to Tamar's musical reality. Now everyone is tuned in.\\" Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the album five out of five stars, saying \\"If there's one thing that you'll take away from Tamar Braxton's triumphant Love and War, it's that this girl can sing like few can. Like all classic R&B; records, it's Tamar's marvelous voice that resounds the loudest throughout‚Äîand long after it's over. It's like she's been the music industry's best kept secret for all of these years, and she's finally getting the attention she deserves. It's definitely her time.\\"  Track listing  Unless otherwise noted, Information is taken from Discogs.com.Braxton, Tamar. \\"Love and War (CD, Album)\\".

When it was released for home viewing years later by Castle Films, the alternate title of On the Scent! was used. Summary Farmer Al Falfa, Kiko the Kangaroo, and numerous other animals are on a trip to the North Pole. To get there, they board an airship at Lakehurst, NJ, which became famous a year later for being the site of the crash of the Hindenburg. Interested in joining their travel are two skunks who are on a small craft tied to the back of the airship. Al, who is the pilot of the dirigible, finds them unfitting and therefore disconnects their craft. After such a voyage, the airship reaches the North Pole, and everybody on board comes out with their sleds and skis. When Al and Kiko ride their sled, they carelessly bash into a walrus and some dark birds who didn't take their moves too kindly. When the marsupial and the old man fall into a pond in the ice cap, they are then captured by the dark birds. The dark birds put Al and Kiko on trial. The judge of the event turns out to be the walrus. While the dark birds are quick to give the guilty verdict, the two skunks, who were supposed to be left behind hours ago, somehow reach the area and come down by parachute. The dark birds and the walrus run away immediately upon seeing the little pole cats. Al, Kiko, and their fellow travelers return to the airship and take off as they don't want to get into any more trouble with the locals.

History The Japanese Patent Attorney System was established on July 1, 1899, fourteen years after the Patent Law System was organized by Korekiyo Takahashi in 1885. In 1899, the number of registered Patent Attorneys was 138. Since then, the number of Patent Attorneys has increased gradually and, in 2012, reached 9300. The organization for Patent Attorneys, namely the Japan Patent Attorneys Association (JPAA), was founded in 1915. Since its founding, the JPAA has played an important role in improving Japan's industrial property rights system. The JPAA has also been a leader in promoting better understanding of various issues relating to intellectual property (IP). For example, the JPAA has hosted a number of seminars and lectures focusing on IP issues on such wide-ranging topics as international treaties, domestic and international laws and new and advanced technologies. Nobuchika Sugimura was the first chairman of the JPAA. Qualification Ordinarily, to become a Patent Attorney, one must pass the examination given annually by the Japan Patent Office. The examination consists of a three-step screening method: first a multiple-choice examination, then an essay writing examination, and finally an oral examination. The examination consists of several mandatory subjects such as industrial property laws and treaties as well as optional subjects such as communication engineering, organic chemistry, and other natural sciences. Registration A person who has passed the examination or who holds another national qualification for becoming a Patent Attorney must register himself or herself with the JPAA to practice as a Patent Attorney. In other words, all Patent Attorneys are required by law to register with the JPAA. The JPAA oversees and regulates the activities of its members, for example by requiring each JPAA member to abide by the code of ethics (which is prescribed by the law) that sets the standard regulating the members' conduct. Organization The president of JPAA is responsible for all matters relating to internal and external affairs of the JPAA. There are eight JPAA vice-presidents who help and support the president. The president and vice-presidents form a Board of Executive Directors that decides on and executes the budget and main projects of the JPAA. In addition to the Board of Executive Directors, the JPAA has a couple of other boards, such as the Audit Board and the Board of Council Members. The JPAA also has five affiliated organizations, such as the International Activities Center and the Education Institute. The JPAA has about forty committees, such as the Patent Committee and the Trademark Committee. In April 2006 the organization of the JPAA will be changed. That is, up to 20 council members will be added to the board of directors and the term of the president will be extended to two years starting from April 2007. The secretariat and his/her staff assist the board of executives in all matters. Currently the Board of Council Members consists of 40 persons elected by JPAA members. This number will increase to 60 in April 2006. The JPAA has a general assembly that is the highest decision making assembly, consisting of all Patent Attorneys. Professional services The Patent Attorney represents both Japanese and foreign clients in the procedures of patent, utility model, design, and trademark applications before the Japan Patent Office. No person except a Patent Attorney or Attorney at Law is permitted to represent clients before the Patent Office in exchange for remuneration. Other than representation before the Patent Office, the Patent Attorney can represent clients in connection with matters related to unfair competition law and the procedures associated with arbitration or settlement regarding IP issues, importation of infringing articles, and IP licensing. The Patent Attorney can represent clients in an administrative proceeding in appealing the Patent Office's decision before the Intellectual Property High Court. The Patent Attorney can appear, present a statement and/or perform an interrogation in court in order to assist a party and its Attorney at Law in connection with matters involving patent, utility model, design, and trademark affairs. The Patent Attorney can prepare expert opinions with respect to patent, utility model, design, and trademark. A Patent Attorney who has passed a special examination after taking 45 hours of courses on IP litigation can represent clients in infringement lawsuits along with an Attorney at Law. Activities =Education= The JPAA started its educational activities in 1962 and established the Training Institute in 1978. The Training Institute offers a number of training and continuing education courses and programs for new and experienced JPAA members. The training program for new members is divided into two parts, one in spring and the other in autumn, each part consisting of about 20 courses of intensive study covering many topics ranging from patent application procedures and studies of judicial cases to international application procedures. The focus of the training for experienced members is primarily on the substantive patent and trademark laws, as well as PCT, EPC, and U.S. patent procedures and the patent procedures of other countries. It also includes litigation, copyright, unfair competition laws, and a number of other areas in which the role of patent attorneys is expected to expand. JPAA has recently introduced an e-learning system, offering its educational programs to its members via the Internet. =International= The JPAA is very active internationally. The JPAA hosts regular meetings with the KPAA, the ACPAA, and the AIPLA in order to promote better mutual understanding among respective groups about various IP systems. The JPAA has also had meetings and other exchanges with the CIPA and other patent attorney associations. The JPAA regularly sends its delegates to WIPO sessions to participate in discussions concerning international IP systems. The JPAA has made significant contributions to APIC training courses, which are organized by the Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation and sponsored by the Japan Patent Office. The JPAA regularly sends lecturers for programs provided by the APIC, and the APIC training courses have been attended by more than 1,000 trainees from the APEC and other countries since 1996. JPAA regularly makes available in English such information as revisions of the Japanese IP laws and changes in practice before the Japan Patent Office. Information such as revisions of intellectual property laws and practice, treaties, and Patent Office and court decision in foreign countries is provided in Japanese to JPAA members. =Research= The JPAA has a research arm ‚Äì the IP Research Institute ‚Äì where researchers study and research a wide variety of matters relating to industrial property. The researchers at the Institute include not only patent attorneys but also scholars. In addition, various committees of the JPAA are studying and researching specific topics. Committees include the Patent Committee, Design Committee, Trademark Committee, Computer Software Committee, and Biotechnology Committee. The findings by these committees are published in the magazine \\"PATENT\\" and made available to the public. =Support and assistance= JPAA also runs the IP Assistance and Support Center for the purposes of enlightening and popularizing the IP system by educating the general public about the roles of the IP system in our society. The Patent Attorneys who volunteer their time and resources help give lectures at schools and organize meetings where people can consult about IP issues. The JPAA assists with invention contests and provides financial assistance to small businesses. =Arbitration Center= JPAA organizes and operates the Arbitration Center for IP rights under joint control with the Japan Federation of Bar Associations. The Arbitration Center is an extrajudicial organization that can resolve disputes very quickly (basically within three months) and privately (in closed sessions, out of court). The arbitrators are selected from Patent Attorneys and Attorneys at Law. The judgment of the arbitrator(s) will constitute the final judgment and no appeal to the court can be made. Arbitration has an advantage over judicial proceeding in that the expenses for arbitration are likely to be considerably less. =Public relations= JPAA publishes the monthly magazine \\"PATENT\\" and the monthly newsletter \\"JPAA Journal\\". In addition to these periodical publications, JPAA makes available a guidebook and/or a brochure for people who are not familiar with the IP system and the roles of Patent Attorneys. JPAA has its own web site (http://www.jpaa.or.jp/), which makes available information about the activities of JPAA, topics about the industrial property system, revisions of related laws, judicial precedents, and so forth.

It is found in the Himalayas through to south China and Vietnam. It is cultivated as an ornamental garden plant, hardy to a few degrees of frost. Description What appear to be stems in Cautleya species are actually \\"pseudostems\\" formed by the tightly wrapped bases or sheaths of the leaves. In C. gracilis, the pseudostems are tall, with some purely sheathing leaves at the base. Other leaves also have blades, free from the pseudostem, long by wide. The inflorescence is a spike, with typically 2‚Äì10 loosely spaced flowers in C. gracilis var. gracilis and 15‚Äì20 more tightly spaced flowers making a compact \\"head\\" in C. gracilis var. robusta. Each yellow or orange flower has a complex structure. A green bract surrounds the sepals, which are largely fused, forming a tubular calyx, split along one side, which is longer than the bract, being long. Inside the calyx, the three petals are fused at the base to form a tube which is longer than the calyx, so that it protrudes. At the end of the tube the petals form three lobes, long. Inside the petals are three petal-like structures (staminodes). The two side staminodes are upright. The lip or labellum is bent downwards and is divided into two at the tip. The single stamen has a two-pronged \\"spur\\" at base of the anther, formed by connective tissue. The seed capsule is red when ripe, splitting to reveal the black seeds. A small white aril is present in C. gracilis var. robusta but is absent in C. gracilis var. gracilis. Taxonomy Cautleya gracilis was first described by James Edward Smith in 1882 as a Roscoea, R. gracilis. It was transferred to Cautleya by Dandy in 1932. The genus name honours Proby Cautley, who was responsible for extensive irrigation works in India under the British Raj. The specific epithet, gracilis, means \\"thin, slender, graceful\\". Cautleya lutea, first described in 1839 as Roscoea lutea, and Cautleya cathcartii, first described in 1890, are now regarded as synonyms in whole or part of C. gracilis. Two varieties are recognized: * Cautleya gracilis var. gracilis (syn. C. lutea (Royle) Hook.f.) ‚Äì usually fewer than 10 flowers in a loose spike, bracts covering less than 2/3 of the calyx * Cautleya gracilis var. robusta (K.Schum.) Sanjappa (syns C. lutea var. robusta K.Schum., C. cathcartii Baker) ‚Äì usually more than 10 flowers in a dense spike, bracts covering 2/3 of the calyx Cultivation Cautleya gracilis is cultivated as an ornamental garden plant. It is hardy outdoors in the midlands of England, where a covering mulch is recommended in the winter. It requires a moisture-retentive, humus-rich soil, out of the full sun. Several collections of the type variety, C. gracilis var. gracilis, are in cultivation. The form grown under the collectors' number CCW 106 is about tall with narrow leaves that are red underneath, and usually seven yellow flowers. The BWJ 7843 form has wider leaves (to ) and primrose yellow flowers. C. gracilis var. robusta is also cultivated. It usually has between 15 and 20 flowers, orange or bright yellow in colour. One cultivar is 'Tenzing's Gold' which is about tall, with a flower spike long.

He was born in Kongsberg. He was hired as a labourer at Kongsberg Dampsag, but after one year he was hired at Kongsberg Silver Mines. He was a miner here from 1883 to 1913, then a supervisor in the district's log driving. From 1903 to 1913 he chaired the local silver miners' trade union. He was elected to Kongsberg city council in 1901 and continuously re-elected. From 1907 he was a member of the executive committee, serving as deputy mayor in 1908, 1911 and 1912. He then served as mayor of Kongsberg from July to December 1913, and later from 1917 through 1922. In his time he was the first social democratic mayor of the city, and also the longest-serving mayor. He was fielded as Labour's parliamentary candidate already in the 1909 election, in the single-member constituency Kongsberg og H√∏nefoss. His running mate was J. O. Thon. With 602 votes he ended behind the Conservative candidate (631 votes) and the victor, Liberal Adolf T. H. Strengehagen (813 votes), who had held the seat since 1898. The two next elections were carried by Nils Gulliksen Berg of the same party. In the 1912 election Jarn√¶s had won the first round with 691 votes, now with C. S. Bentzen as running mate. To their advantage the Liberal vote was split between Strengehagen and B. Cranner, but in the second round Strengehagen as well as the Conservative candidate pulled out to back Berg. Berg won with 1 080 votes against Jarn√¶s' 892 and Cranner's 696. In the 1915 election Jarn√¶s fielded as the running mate of Bentzen. They won the first round, but in the second round all non-socialist parties rallied behind Berg who won the seat for the second and last time. He later joined the Social Democratic Labour Party, and was their third ballot candidate in the 1921 election (the ballot was headed by Bentzen) and the fifth ballot candidate in the 1924 election.

In 1891 the WCTU officially endorsed the suffrage cause, the first major women's organization to support women's suffrage. Edith Archibald became the leader of the Maritime chapter of the WCTU the following year.

Two years later, in 1893, Edith Archibald and others made the first official attempt to have a suffrage bill for women property holders passed in Nova Scotia. The bill was passed by the legislature but quashed by Attorney General James Wilberforce Longley (who opposed unions and female emancipation for the twenty years he was in office).Timeline of Women's History, Canada Suffrage Playground movement began in Nova Scotia, (1906), Local Council of Women, Halifax, Nova ScotiaSandra Markham, Leisure and the National Council of Women of Canada, 1995http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/best_edna_may_williston_15F.html The year following the defeat of the first suffrage bill, the Local Council was established in 1894 as the local chapter of the National Council of Women of Canada (NCWC). On August 30, 1894, the executive committee met for the first time at Government House. Emma MacIntosh serving as the first president. Anna Leonowens was the secretary. Enfranchisement was the issue. (The concomitant preoccupation with enfranchisement was reflected locally in the founding of the Woman‚Äôs Suffrage Association in March 1895; Leonowens was president, assisted by sisters Eliza Ritchie and Mary Walcott Ritchie, along with Charlotte McInnes.) Between 1892 and 1895, thirty-four suffrage petitions were presented to the Nova Scotia legislature, and six suffrage bills were introduced, the final one in 1897.Women's Suffrage Movement in Canada by Patricia Roome, p. 6 In June 1897 the annual meeting of the National Council was convened in Halifax, where presentations were made by Lady Aberdeen and American suffragist May Wright Sewall.> On June 11, 1914, the Suffrage Club was established at Wright's home to work on granting women the right to vote throughout the province. On 22 February 1917 the LCWH presented a suffrage petition endorsed by forty-one women's organizations. When the Liberal Premier ignored the issue, irate members introduced a private member bill. Its defeat marked the birth of the Nova Scotia Equal Franchise League in the spring of 1917.Women's Suffrage Movement in Canada by Patricia Roome, p. 14 On April 26, 1918, with the support of premier George Henry Murray, the Assembly passed The Nova Scotia Franchise Act, which gives women the right to vote in Nova Scotia's provincial elections, the first province to do so in Atlantic Canada.Premier Murray's response (A month later Nova Scotian and Prime Minister of Canada Robert Borden - whose wife Laura Bond was former president of the LCWH - used his majority to pass women's suffrage for the whole country.

He was life president of Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India. Salvi is described as a persuasive speaker. His efforts in the field resulted in the merging of \\"hu tu tu\\" into a standardised version of kabaddi. Hu tu tu, a traditional game similar to kabaddi, played in Maharashtra has nine players per side whereas the standard kabaddi is played with seven players per side. Traditionalists in Maharashtra had resisted replacement of the word \\"hu tu tu\\" with \\"kabaddi\\" a word more common in northern India. They had persisted in their resistance even after its acceptance in the southern India states. Salvi was a Royist, who cultivated good relations with the state government and lobbied with chief ministers of Maharashtra, to obtain state patronage for Kabaddi. He didn't abuse his contacts for personal benefits; when asked by the Chief Minister what he wanted, Salvi even though he lived in a rented house, requested for space for an administrative office for kabaddi. Salvi travelled widely to popularise kabaddi. In the 1970s, Salvi organised tours to Bangladesh and Japan. His efforts lead to the popularisation of the sport internationally and its being played in the Asian Games in 1990 where India won the Gold medal. He was a member of the working committee of the International Kabaddi Federation when the foundation was created in 2004. Salvi received the \\"Shiv Chhatrapati Rajya Krida Jivan Gaurav Puraskar\\", awarded by the Government of Maharashtra to sportspersons from Maharashtra for lifetime contribution to sports in 2005. He is popularly referred to as \\"Buwa Salvi\\" and honorarily as \\"Kabaddi Maharashi\\" or the grand old man of Kabaddi. He died on 15 February 2007 at the age of 75 in Mumbai. The 27th Federation Cup Kabaddi Tournament, held in May 2007 in Mumbai and organised by Maharashtra State Kabaddi Association was dedicated to Salvi. His birthday, 15 July, is observed as Kabaddi Din (\\"Kabaddi Day\\") in Maharashtra. The venue of the 57th Maharashtra State Kabaddi Championship was named after him as \\"Late Shankarrao Salvi Krida Nagri\\".

Several gauge railways were planned in order to link the extensive narrow-gauge railways in the Austro-Hungarian Empire with those in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Until the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in 1912 several were constructed. Between World War I and World War II the network was extended significantly, at the end connecting the Adriatic Coast with Belgrade, with the network growing to around 1500 km in length. Construction of a new standard-gauge line from Sarajevo to Ploƒçe on the Adriatic in 1966 replaced the Narentabahn from Sarajevo to the coast and had the effect of isolating the south-western narrow-gauge system from the railways starting at Sarajevo. With the demise of a connecting network all the other remaining narrow-gauge lines were then at risk and restricted to local traffic. The system based on the Adriatic closed in 1975. By 1979 the rest of the Bosnian lines had closed. In Serbia the last line closed in 1983. The most modern diesel railcars were sold to the Portuguese Railways (where they regauged to metre gauge for use on the Douro Valley metre-gauge lines, such as the Tua line), becoming Portuguese train type 9700.

It is one of only a handful of extant Customs Houses in the state; others are in Albany, Broome, Cossack, and Geraldton. History Photograph of the Customs House viewed from the south (corner of Cliff and Phillimore Streets) It was built on the corner of Cliff Street and Phillimore Streets on the site of the old railway station, a location selected by William Lyne (and recommended by the Fremantle Citizens League). William Hedges also lobbied in support of the location. An earlier idea of renovating the old Post Office building for Customs' use was scrapped. On 18 September 1907, the state government allocated ¬£7,500 (of the total projected cost of ¬£10,000) to be spent on construction in the following year. The architectural plans were prepared by the State's Public Works Department under the supervision of the Principal Architect, Hillson Beasley. The building construction was undertaken by a local firm, Ashman and Warner, under the supervision of Mr Sefton of the Public Works Department. The two storey building is constructed of brick on a base of Cottesloe limestone. The heavily moulded cornices and facings were constructed from Donnybrook stone, which was chosen in preference (due to lower cost, and better weather resistance) to Sydney freestone. Western Australian timbers were also used. The Postmaster-General decided not to open a telegraph office in the new building, because one already existed close by.  Current use  In 1986 the building was used to house the Fremantle Arts Foundation (FAF), with the creation of eight artist's studios. The FAF was established by the State Government to provide a cultural component to 1987 America's Cup Defence. The building was subsequently purchased by the State and managed by the Foundation. In 1992 FAF changed its name to the Artists Foundation of Western Australia Ltd (AFWA), providing support for visual artists through statewide delivery of professional development, support and advocacy services. In 2004 AFWA was rebranded and now trades as Artsource. The building housed the WA Circus School until 2017, and currently accommodates 24 artist's studios. Heritage value The building was classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA) on 28 October 1974 and was placed on the Register of the National Estate on 21 March 1978. The building was formally listed on the State Register of Heritage Places by the Heritage Council of Western Australia on 23 April 1999. It is also listed on the City of Fremantle's municipal heritage list.

Treschow, Gerhard, Industridrivende (Dansk biografisk Lexikon / XVII. Bind.) Treschowg√•rden (Fred.

After attending the University of Utrecht, he was appointed tax collector as tax collector in Christiania (now Oslo) Norway in 1683. His business operations started in 1690, when he became the owner of a brickworks at Christiania. In time, he came to own six sawmills in Norderhov. He was a major exporter of lumber as well as the owner of a fleet of ships. Between 1693 to 1694, Gerhard Treschow began to collaborate with Ole Bentsen (1653-1734) who had a 15 year royal charter to create a paper mill at Christiania. He had worked together with Dutch experts and machinery delivered from England. Export of paper started in 1696. In 1698, he demanded the forced sale of Bentsen's interests. That same year, Treschow took over the royal privileges of the paper mill. This would become the forerunner for the founding of Bentse Brug, Norway's first paper mill. He also owned Bj√∏lsen sawmill at Akerselva. By 1697, he was co-owner of four major ships and by 1705 one of the larger shipowners in Christiania.

Description The species in this genus are spread by the orofaecal route. They infect the epithelium of the gut. After ingestion the sporozoites attach to the intestinal epithelial cells by a pseudomerite and become multinucleate, irregularly shaped plasmodia They then divide internally becoming mycetoid meronts which release merozoites. The merozoites become mononucleate gregarinoid meronts which also attach to the intestinal epithelium by a pseudomerite. They subsequently differentiate into meronts which are then released. The meronts which are released serve as gamonts that fuse in pairs forming a gametocyst. The gametocyst then transforms into a single oocyst which containing 8 sporozoites.

Work  Eric Hattan departs from concrete objects and spaces. He questions places, architectures and situations of all-day-life through breaking regularities and subversing the assumed stasis of the world with playful irony. The rearrangement of clothing, furniture, pedestals or monitors plays a decisive role in his oeuvre, even became independent and exposes given situations to unbiased observation. Eric Hattan directs his gaze on processes and incidents in the urban space through his video camera. During expeditions through cities and their peripheries he discovers a potential of plastic forms, which complete, comment or permeate his installative works since the 1990s. The phenomenological exploration of daily processes and random movements leads him often to construction sites. Not yet or not anymore used zones, property just before demolition or during a building freeze, waste land and nowhere land, lay bare sculptural qualities, which challenge the artist to different insights. Hattan's usually temporary projects in public space are evidence of an interest in inverting the view on the familiar. Hattan's artistic career developed parallel to his early engagement for a young scene of artists, with whom he realized many exhibitions and performances in the self-organized Basel project space Filiale during the 1980s and 1990s.

The summit is part of the Ptarmigan Traverse. The mountain is situated on the crest of the Cascade Range, on the shared border of Snohomish County and Chelan County, also straddling the boundary between the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and the Wenatchee National Forest. The South Cascade Glacier lies below its western slope, and the LeConte Glacier lies on the northeast slope. Its nearest higher peak is Spire Point, to the south-southwest. Climate Sentinel Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Sentinel Peak from the northeast near Maple Pass Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is south-southwest of Sentinel Peak, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

(\\"Hattie\\") Cosgrove and Cornelius B. (\\"Burt\\") Cosgrove. Although the self- taught husband-and-wife team had observed other archaeological digs and excavated on their own New Mexico property, Swarts Ruin would be the couple's first professional archaeology endeavor, financed by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, where Swarts Ruin artifacts are conserved. Although J. Walter Fewkes had brought Mimbres pottery to the public's attention in 1914, the publication in 1932 of The Swarts Ruin: A Typical Mimbres Site in Southwestern New Mexico gave readers not just the first coherent description of a Mimbres village, but caused a sensation thanks to Hattie's more than 700 painstaking pen-and-ink drawings of Mimbres bowl designs, which provided eclectic, enduring, and powerful visual inspiration to Native American potters and to a wide variety of Southwest artists. Although the Cosgroves were aware of tree-ring dating, they did not know that charred wooden beams could yield accurate information under the new method; unfortunately no burned wood samples were saved. Nevertheless, the Cosgroves estimated the date of the site (1000‚Äì1150 CE) to within 20 years of what later archaeologists would determine a likely end date (1130 CE), based on comparison to similar Mimbres communities in the region. The Swarts Ruin discovery broadly informed Mary Colter's designs for the Santa Fe Railroad's distinctive \\"Mimbre√±o\\" china, produced for the Super Chief (and later for business class dining cars) from 1936 to 1970. To satisfy collector demands, authorized \\"Mimbre√±o\\" reproductions have been manufactured since 1989.  References  Cosgrove, Harriet S. and C.

Life The eldest son of Hugh Chamberlen the elder, he was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and took the degree of Master of Arts (MA) in 1683 per literas regias. After studying medicine at the University of Leyden he graduated M.D. at Cambridge in 1689. In 1694 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and was censor in 1707, 1719, 1721. Chamberlen practised midwifery like his forebears, and had many fashionable patients. He dined with Jonathan Swift, and attended Francis Atterbury in the Tower of London. His own house was in King Street, Covent Garden, but he spent much time in the society of the Duchess of Buckingham and Normanby at Buckingham House. Cnamberlen died at Buckingham House after a long illness on 17 June 1728. Works Chamberlen's only published work was a Latin epithalamium, written on the marriage of Princess Anne in 1683. Legacy A monument to Chamberlen, put up by the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, is in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey. His life size effigy reclines in doctoral robes on the lid of a sarcophagus surrounded by emblematic sculptures, while a long Latin epitaph by Atterbury praises his family, his life, his descendants, and his patron. The safe delivery of the Duchess of Buckingham and Normanby, which is mentioned by Atterbury as one of the reasons for the monument, was also commemorated in the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby's essay On Vulgar Errors. The \\"Psylas\\" of Samuel Garth's The Dispensary (6th edit. London, 1706, p. 91) also refers to Chamberlen.

Early life and Career  Davidson was born on 3 March 1894 in Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon), to Sir Leybourne Francis Watson Davidson and Jane Rosalind Dudgeon Davidson. He had his education at Cheltenham College, England and later at Trinity College, Cambridge where he began his undergraduate medical education, graduating BA. At the onset of World War I in 1914, he enlisted in the Gordon Highlanders, and his medical education was interrupted. He was seriously wounded in the war in 1915 while he was fighting in France, and spent the next two years recovering. He then resumed his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh and in 1919 graduated MB ChB with first class honours. He then worked as a house physician at Leith Hospital. He became a Member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1921 (proceeding to the Fellowship in 1926), graduated and awarded a Gold Medal for his M.D. thesis on Immunisation and antibody reactions in 1925. In 1928, he was appointed as assistant physician to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. He then was appointed as Professor of Medicine at the University of Aberdeen in 1930, which was one of the first full-time Chairs of Medicine anywhere and the first in Scotland. While working there, he spent his time in hospital work, teaching and research, not preferring private practice. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1932. His proposers were Arthur Logan Turner, James Ritchie, Thomas Jones Mackie and William Thomas Ritchie.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf In 1938, he was given the Chair of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, in which he remained until he retired in 1959. He was also the President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh from 1953 to 1957, and the President of The Association of Physicians of Great Britain and Ireland in 1957. He played an important role in upgrading, modernising and broadening the hospital teaching facilities within Edinburgh area.  Teaching  Davidson is remembered as a gifted teacher at the bedside, where he taught that \\"everything had to be questioned and explained\\". While at the University of Edinburgh, he himself gave most of the systematic lectures in Medicine and also made his lectures notes available to students as typewritten notes. It was these notes which formed the basis of the textbook, \\"Principles and Practices of Medicine\\", that he published in 1952. He has been a teacher to many well known doctors including John George Macleod, Professor Ronald Haxton Girdwood, a hematologist who discovered the link between folate deficiency and Megaloblastic anemia, Sir John McMichael, a pioneer in the field of Cardiology whose works formed the basis of success in the treatment of cardiac diseases in Britain, and Harold Thomas Swan, who discovered and published two important case-notes recording the successful clinical use of penicillin in 1930.  Research works  Davidson was a member of the Empire Rheumatism Council, now known as Arthritis Research UK, and has made significant contributions to developments in the field of Rheumatology. He has published a book on nutrition, \\"Human nutrition and dietetics\\", based on his research in the field. He was also interested in the field of hematology.  Personal life  Davidson married Isabel Margaret Anderson (d.1979) on 27 July 1927 in Edinburgh. They had no children. They lived in Woodhall House in Juniper Green, south-west of Edinburgh from 1953 to 1957. He died on 27 September 1981. He is buried in the ancient stone vault of his ancestor, George Davidson of Newmills, in Currie churchyard, near his family home.  Books published  In 1959 Davidson wrote, with collaborators A.P Meiklejohn and R. Passmore, the book Human nutrition and Dietetics that dealt with nutrition and health. The book has remained a standard reference on nutrition since then. A more well known work of Davidson is Principles and Practice of Medicine, a medical textbook which he first published in 1952. His lecture notes that he had previously distributed to students while working in the University of Edinburgh formed the basis of this publication. The book was of \\"modest size and price\\" and was well received by medical students. The book is now in its 23rd edition, is considered a standard textbook for undergraduate medical students, and has sold over two million copies altogether. He co-wrote The Textbook of Medical Treatment with Sir Derrick Dunlop.

It grows in the northern part of Southern Africa, from northern Namibia up to the DRC and eastwards to Malawi and Mozambique. In Namibia it is commonly referred to by its Herero name Ejova (singular)/ Omajowa (plural). German Namibians refer to the mushroom as \\"Termitenpilz.\\" Characteristics The sporocarps (the fruitbody of the fungus) are the \\"size of a man‚Äôs fist\\" on emergence. They rapidly expand to 15‚Äì28 cm and may reach 40 cm in diameter. The caps are white and the thick, soft scales may be stained yellowish to reddish-brown by the soil of the mound. The scales are white underneath their uppermost layer. The pseudorhiza (a cord-like structure resembling a plant root) tapers downwards towards its origin in the termite nest, and may reach a length of about 90 cm. The lower, narrower part of the pseudorhiza has a denser consistency than the above ground-part. The sporocarps appear in groups of 5‚Äì10 around the lower parts of termite mound, and grow to roughly 50 cm above soil level. Up to 50 sporocarps have been observed around a single mound. Omajowa usually appear after soaking rains of 12 mm or more during spring, but the main crop develops during January to March which is the main rainy season. The mushroom may form on the same termite mound for many years provided that part of the hyphae is left in the mound when the cap is harvested for eating. On maturation of the fungus, the partial veil is consumed by termites. Termite association  Omajowa do not appear on all termite mounds. The mushroom occurs only on the tall termite mounds of central and northern parts of Namibia where the average rainfall is 350 mm or more. These mounds frequently reach 4 to 5 m in height and their apex is always inclined towards north. The associated termite is the Termes bellicosus also known as Macrotermes michaelseni. In Zambia the Termitomyces schimperi is found at the termite mounds of Odontotermes patruus.

It was released in 1989 and is among Knox's best known songs. While the song did not chart when originally released in 1989, it has since become well known from its use in New Zealand film and television productions, especially in a television advertisement for Vogel's bread in 2007. In 2001 the song was placed in 13th in the APRA Top 100 New Zealand Songs of All Time list, as voted by New Zealand members of the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA). The song then featured on the Nature's Best album of the top 30 tracks.  Background and writing  The song was written as a heartfelt love song about Knox's then partner Barbara Ward. The lyrics refer to Ward and the couple's two children with the line \\"This is a love song for John and Liesha's mother\\". The song's title and main refrain comes from a lyric in The Velvet Underground song \\"Venus in Furs\\" - \\"Taste the whip, in love not given lightly\\". The song is performed in Chris Knox's trademark solo style - simple percussion loops with clean and distorted guitar.  Music video  The music video was directed by Chris Knox and shot at his home in Grey Lynn, Auckland. The video starts with an extreme close-up of Knox's face, slowly zooming out over the duration of the song to reveal Knox surrounded by his friends and family. Edits are done on the beat. The video is shot in both black-and-white and colour, with most of the black-and-white footage used at the beginning of the video and most of the colour footage used at the end.

Early life Charles Vilain XIIII was born in Brussels in 1803 as the eldest son of Count Philippe-Louis Vilain XIIII, mayor of Rupelmonde, and Baroness Sophie de Felz. He was the eldest male descendant of one of the main branches of the ancient noble family Vilain XIIII. He studied at the Lyceum of Brussels, the Charlemagne college in Paris, and the Jesuit college in Saint-Acheul. He started studying Law at the University of Li√®ge in 1821, but dropped out of school and married Baroness Pauline de Billeh√© de Valensart (1800‚Äì1842) on 21 May 1822. Political career In 1828, Charles Vilain XIIII became a member of the States-General of the Netherlands and joined the opposition against William I of the Netherlands, but influenced by the writings of Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais, he had more progressive ideas than his father and his uncle Charles-Hippolyte Vilain XIIII, both also members of the States- General. In 1830, he was a member of the National Congress of Belgium, where he became the Secretary of the Central Bureau, which was responsible for drafting the new Constitution of Belgium. Charles Vilain XIIII read the Belgian Constitution at the Oath of the first king, Leopold I. In 1830, he was offered but refused the function of Governor of Limburg. He was elected to the Chamber of Representatives in 1831 for Sint-Niklaas, and reelected in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. Vilain XIIII was appointed Belgian Ambassador to the Holy See in 1832, and sent to the Vatican and some Italian kingdoms as a special emissary in 1832, a mission which was largely a failure, and which was responsible for Charles' move away from progressive ideas towards more reactionary and anti-democratic principles. On his return, he became governor of East Flanders in September 1834, succeeding Werner de Lamberts-Cortenbach; he held this position until the end of August 1836. At the end of 1835, he again became a special emissary to the Vatican and the Italian States; this mission lasted until 1839 and was a success. Due to his frequent absences, he didn't stand in the 1836 elections for MP. After the end of his mission in Italy, he again was a candidate MP for Sint-Niklaas, and became the MP from 1839 until 1848. He was the vice-president of the Chamber of Representatives from 1843 until 1847. In 1848, he switched from Sint-Niklaas to Maaseik (where his family castle was located), and became MP for Maaseik from 1848 until his death in 1878. He was President of the Chamber between 1855 and 1858. He was mayor of Leut from 1842 until 1878. He was a candidate for Governor of Antwerp in 1844, but didn't get the position. In 1855, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Pierre de Decker government, until the end of that cabinet in 1857. From 1870 until 1875 he was again elected president of the Chamber of Representatives, and in 1875 he received the honorary title of Minister of State. He was made a Knight in the Order of Leopold on 30 August 1835, and raised to Officer in the same order on 13 Mai 1843; he was also awarded the Iron Cross. Foreign decorations include the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Januarius in Sicily, Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus in Italy, Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Medjidie in the Ottoman Empire, Grand Cross of the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi√ßosa in Portugal, Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle in Russian Poland, and Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star in Sweden. Personal life Castle of Leut, also known as Castle Vilain XIIII, home of Charles from 1822 until his death Pauline de Billeh√© died on 9 April 1842. They had seven children, all daughters. The marriage gave him the castle of Leut, in Maasmechelen, which became the new family home until the last of his daughters died in 1922; it is now the retirement home Vilain XIIII. Not having a male heir, he was succeeded as head of the Vilain XIIII family by his younger brother Alfred Vilain XIIII. Charles' oldest daughter Zo√´ Th√©odorine Ghislaine Vilain XIIII was born 1 November 1824; she married Baron Gustave de Marches √† Guirsch on 16 April 1844. Her sister Marguerite Ghislaine Alfredine Antoinette was born 20 September 1829 and married Baron Jacques de Schiervel on 7 January 1852.

On 12 May 2016 at the European Championships, Goodfellow and Daley earned their seventh consecutive 10m synchro medal. They were in position for gold after the first five dives of the competition, but had to settle for silver after Germany passed them by less than one point in the final round. On 10 June 2016 at the British National Championships Goodfellow and Daley won gold in the 10m synchro. Their Front 4 ¬Ω Somersaults tucked dive (109C) was their best single dive in the competition, and received a score of 95.46. Goodfellow and Daley earned a bronze medal in the 2016 Olympic 10m synchro competition in Rio on 8 August primarily by scoring 92.13 on their fifth dive, which was a 109C with a 3.7 degree of difficulty. This was their highest scoring dive. This score moved them from fifth to third. Their sixth dive was a 207B dive, with a 3.6-degree of difficulty, and had to be 84 or higher for them to maintain third place and edge out Germany. The score of 89.64 for their sixth dive ended the competition, and resulted in the bronze medal for Goodfellow and Daley. =2018‚Äì2019= At the 2018 Commonwealth Games held at the Gold Coast, Australia, Goodfellow won gold on the men's synchronised 10m platform with Tom Daley. In 2019, Goodfellow partnered with Jack Laugher in men's synchronised 3m springboard as Laugher's regular partner Chris Mears had taken a year out from competition, while Daley partnered with Matty Lee in the 10m platform synchro.

Combining with the built-in objects of the environment, DIPS enables to program the interaction between audio and visual events with ease, and supports the realization of interactive multimedia art as well as interactive computer music.  Summary of Features  *A plug-in software for Max/MSP (Max 5 and 6) *More than 300 Max external objects and abstractions *More than 90 OpenGL objects included *More than 110 visual effect objects (Dfx library, Core Image Filters) *A utility library for the easy of programming (prefix Dlib) *A comprehensive set of sample patches, and a detailed tutorial *Handling images & movie files (QuickTime, OpenGL) *Render and move 3D models (OpenGL) *Video signal input (QuickTime, video texture) *Video input analysis: motion detect, face tracking (OpenCV, OpenGL) *Importing 3D models (.obj file) *Importing Quartz Composer files *OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) programming interface *Easy integration of visual events using DIPSWindowMixer (OpenGL)  Description  DIPS is a free plug-in software (a set of external objects) for Max/MSP. It supports the designing of the interaction between sound and visual events in Max using Apple‚Äôs Core Image, OpenGL and OpenCV technologies, and consequently, provides a powerful and user-friendly programming environment for the creation of interactive multimedia art. DIPS can be used to detect a performer‚Äôs motions and to track positions of subtle details, such as the face, mouth, and eyes. It can also be used to measure the distance between objects and a Kinect sensor system, and offers powerful tools for realtime image processing of incoming video stream and stored movie files. In addition, it can be used to create complex images in a virtual three-dimensional space. The DIPS consists of a library of more than 300 Max external objects and abstractions, a comprehensive set of sample patches, and a detailed tutorial. Some of its strong points, in comparison with other similar plug-ins and software, are its ease of programming, power, and efficiency. The sample patches and tutorial contained in the installation package allows composers and artists who are interested in the creation of interactive art to realize sophisticated realtime video effects on a live video signal at their first practice. And because of its ease of programming, it is likely that one will soon acquire skills needed to create state-of-the-art interactive performance works, multimedia installations, interactive multimedia artworks, and Max VJ applications using DIPS.  History  Initially developed by Shu Matsuda in 1997, DIPS was a plug-in software for Max/FTS running on SGI Octane and O2 computers. Since 2000, it has been developed by the DIPS Development Group supervised by Takayuki Rai. Current active group members are Shu Matsuda, Yota Morimoto, Takuto Fukuda, and Keitaro Takahashi.

Established in 2007, the organization comprises about 700 enterprises, which together form 14 holding companies: eleven in the defense-industry complex and three in civil sectors. Rostec's organizations are located in 60 constituents of the Russian Federation and supply goods to over 70 countries worldwide. The organization is headed by Sergey Chemezov. History alt= On 23 November 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed federal law No. 270 to establish a state corporation named Rostekhnologii, which was previously passed by the State Duma on 9 November and passed by the Federation Council on 16 November. Later in 10 July 2008, newly-elected Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree that transfers 443 struggling enterprises to the ownership under Rostekhnologii. Out of these acquired assets, 30% of such enterprises were in pre-crisis and crisis condition, 28 entities in bankruptcy proceedings, 17 had no business operations, and 27 had lost part of their assets or faced a material risk of such loss, with all facing a total debt of RUB630 billion. In addition, these enterprises had worn out fixed assets, dilapidated production chains, and poor management. After the acquisition, structural reforms were made, helping the enterprises emerge from their financial struggles with a 20%‚Äì30% increase in production growth, five times the national average. Most of the profits were acquired by Rostekhnologii, which 80% of it was from 20% of Rostekhnologii's assets. The 20% included the titanium monopoly VSMPO-AVISMA, helicopter manufacturers Mil and Kamov, AvtoVAZ, and KamAZ. This in turn brought executives of some companies in conflict with each other, such as the case with Mil and Kamov in which they refuse to communicate with each other. As a result, Rostekhnologii had to work with the two companies so they can cooperate with each other. On 21 December 2012, Rostekhnologii rebranded itself as Rostec to make the corporation more open to the world. Rostec also featured a new logo, an open square symbolizing a window to the world and a focus frame, as well a new slogan \\"Partner in development\\" and implemented changes in its corporate governance structure. The corporation spent $1.5 million for rebranding. The corporate brand, which was launched in late 2012, is currently one of Russia's 15 most valuable brands and has a value similar to that of major companies such as Rosneft and Rostelecom. On 16 July 2014, as a result of Russian intervention in Ukraine and Russian annexation of Crimea, Rostec was one of the companies that was sanctioned by the Obama administration. Sergey Chemezov, current CEO of Rostec, was one of the individuals targeted by the United States (U.S.) and the European Union (E.U.), whose visa was banned and assets froze by the E.U.. Rostec's access to U.S. debt markets was also limited. Rostec was forced to rethink its strategy for its holding companies. In December 2015, Rostec's supervisory board approved its development strategy through 2025. According to the strategy, Rostec intends to change the Russian economic model by putting less emphasis on weaponry, aviation components, and software and more emphasis on electronics, telecommunications, robotics, and other high-tech industries. This in turn would diversify the Russian economy, increasing the share of high-tech civilian products and non-primary exports.

A special focus of the corporation's responsibility on labor involves 21 dominant employers that are part of Rostec. As an example of corporate activity aimed at stabilization of social environment in one-company towns, mass media covered Rostec's labor policy in relation to AvtoVAZ, a dominant employer it Togliatti during the 2008-2009 economic crisis. Despite large-scale layoffs, public unrest was prevented by a special employment program for dismissed workers. The unemployment rate in the company town of Verkhnyaya Salda, Sverdlovsk Oblast, which is owned by VSMPO-AVISMA, is less than 1%.  Health  In order to implement its Health National Program, the corporation has set up nine centers for high medical technologies. Five centers for cardiovascular surgery (Khabarovsk, Krasnoyarsk, Chelyabinsk, Perm and Kaliningrad), two centers for neurosurgery (Tyumen and Novosibirsk) and to centers for traumatic surgery, orthopedics and endoprosthesis replacement (Smolensk and Barnaul).–ù–∞–¥–µ–µ–º—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ –æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥–µ–π –≤ –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –º–µ–¥—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä—ã –Ω–µ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç ‚Äì –∑–∞–º. –≥–µ–Ω–¥–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ ¬´–†–æ—Å—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–π¬ª –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –í–û–õ–û–ë–£–ï–í Rostec is a participant in the Perinatal center development program along with Russia's Ministry of Health, the Federal Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund and federal member state authorities.

Life  As his surname indicates, Chaldos was native of Chaldia, region in northeastern Asia Minor. He may have been of Armenian origin. He served as military governor (strategos) of the Armeniac and Bucellarian themes in Asia Minor, before being sent to Thessalonica as doux in , in succession to Gregory Taronites, who had been killed in a Bulgarian ambush. Alternatively, he may have held all three offices concurrently, despite their wide geographic separation. He was certainly at his post as governor of Thessalonica in September 995, for he issued an act (sigillion) confirming various privileges and exemptions of the Kolobou Monastery at Ierissos on Chalcidice, which survives to this day. Soon after, in early 996, he was captured by the Bulgarians in another ambush placed by Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria. He remained in Bulgarian captivity for 22 years, until the final collapse of Bulgarian resistance in 1018, when he was released upon the surrender of Dragomouzos, the Bulgarian governor of Strumitza, to Emperor Basil II. Following the death of Taronites and the capture of Chaldos, Basil II appointed one of his most trusted subordinates, Nikephoros Ouranos, as commander-in-chief in the Balkans, resulting in the crushing victory over Samuel and his army at the Battle of Spercheios. John Chaldos is mentioned next, and for the last time, during the 1030 campaign by Emperor Romanos III Argyros against the Mirdasids of Aleppo, which he advised against. The Emperor did not heed his opinion, and the campaign ended in a humiliating defeat in the Battle of Azaz.

This page covers environmental issues in Chile. Overview The country of Chile is a virtual continental island bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Andes Mountains on the east, and the Atacama Desert in the north; it is home to several important ecoregions, such as the Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests, a biodiversity hotspot that harbors richly endemic flora and fauna, and the Tropical Andes, which stretches into northern Chile.Chile - Encyclopedia of Earth There are endangered species in Chile, including the South Andean huemul, tundra peregrine falcon, puna rhea, Chilean woodstar, ruddy-headed goose, and green sea turtle. As of 2001, 16 species of mammals in a total of 91 were considered endangered. Of 296 breeding bird species, 18 were threatened with extinction. Also threatened were four types of freshwater fish and 268 plant species. Prominent issues There are a series of environmental issues in this country, with a dynamic and diversified economy. Chile's main environmental problems are deforestation and the resulting soil erosion. From 1985 to 1995, Chile lost nearly 2 million hectares of native forest; these forests were destroyed for pulp, and made way for industrial tree farms. As a result, Chile now has the world's largest expanse of radiata pine tree farms and some of the world's most endangered native forests. Air pollution from industry and transportation and water pollution are especially acute in urban centers. In 1996, Chile's industrial carbon dioxide emissions totaled 48.7 million metric tons. Untreated sewage poses the major threat to the nation's water quality. As of 2001, Chile had 928 cu km of renewable water resources. While 99% of its urban dwellers have pure drinking water, only 58% of its rural dwellers have the same access. Chile is one of the major mining countries of the world and big-scale mining also represents an important environmental challenge. Severe water shortages affecting many local communities were due not only to persistent drought but to structural problems in the policies governing the exploitation of natural resources, including privatized water management; this led to big protests.  Water pollution  Much of Chile's water resources are privatized due to the 1981 Water Code which created a market based on water rights. Water is treated as an asset where once an individual or private company receives water rights, they can choose to sell or rent water. The concentration of water resources in the hands of a few corporations has resulted in Chile having the highest water rates in Latin America. Nearly 90% of the water rights for hydroelectric production are owned by three companies. There are more water rights that have been issued than there are reserves in some parts of the country which has led to the drying up of groundwater resources. This shortage has particularly affected the rural and indigenous population of Chile. The mining industry has had a considerable impact on the environment of Chile. One region in particular that been significantly impacted is that of the Atacama Desert, which is considered one of the driest regions in the world. Mining requires a large quantity of water, with much of this water coming from groundwater supplies. Dust from mining operations can also accelerate the melting of snow deposits on the Andean glaciers. This puts a considerable strain on snow melt water supplies which harms the rural communities living in the Atacama. Another source of pollution results from the mining of lithium within some of the lakes in the region. This has the potential to affect local flamingo population as they are reliant on the lakes as a source of shrimp.  Air pollution  Increased economic activity has resulted in a degradation of Chile's air quality. Santiago, the capital city of Chile, is surrounded by mountain ranges which facilitates the accumulation of pollutants from car emissions and industrial development over the region. Hospitals become overcrowded as a result of respiratory related problems each year in Santiago. The air pollution in Santiago has resulted in an average of 20,000 people suffering from respiratory problems every year. It is common to use wood for heating in the southern portion of Chile, which tends to experience cold temperatures, as it is less costly than gas or electricity. Sacrifice Zone: Valpara√≠so The valpara√≠so Province is home to the country's largest private and public ports, Quintero and Valpara√≠so city, respectively. This area has a high concentration of polluting industries including copper smelters, thermoelectric plants, and power plants. The Province of Valpara√≠so is known as a national Sacrifice zone, having high concentrations of heavy metals and other pollutants. History Traditionally the people of the Valpara√≠so Province found their living through artisanal fishing and agriculture. In the past several decades the region's main economy is tourism, in 2016 there was an estimated 1.498,295 tourists visiting the area.Rangel-Buitrago, Nelson, et al. ‚ÄúCan Coastal Scenery Be Managed? The Valpara√≠so Region, Chile as a Case Study.‚Äù Ocean and Coastal Management, vol. 163, Sept. 2018, pp. 383‚Äì400. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.07.016. The largest ports in the country are located in the Valparaiso region. The port of Valparaiso is also home to the Chilean Navy base. High rates of emissions, black and Brown carbon (BC and BrC), come from truck and ship activities in this port.Mar√≠n, Julio C., et al. ‚ÄúProperties of Particulate Pollution in the Port City of Valparaiso, Chile.‚Äù Atmospheric Environment, vol. 171, Dec. 2017, pp. 301‚Äì316. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.09.044. The public transportation in the city of Valpara√≠so is run off of diesel fuel. Industries in the Area Quintero Puchuncav√≠ have 15 polluting industries in the region.https://www.latercera.com/nacional/noticia/quintero-puchuncavi-la-zona- sacrificio/295044/ Many of these industries were built in the early 1960s and have been expanded upon since then. Industries include: Conc√≥n oil refinery run by Empresa Nacional del Petr√≥leo (ENAP), Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Station and Ventanas Power Plant (the largest power plant in Chile) run by AES Gener, Ventanas Division Copper Smelter operated by the world's largest producer of copper Codelco,http://www.mining.com/worlds-top-copper-producer- faces-lengthy-smelter-halt-major-mine/ and Nehuenco Power Plant operated by Colb√∫n S.A. Cases of Pollution In 2011, Escuela La Greda located in Puchuncav√≠, was engulfed in a chemical cloud from the Ventanas Industrial Complex. The sulfur cloud poisoned an estimated 33 children and 9 teachers, resulting in the relocation of the school. The old location of the school is now abandoned.https://www.latercera.com/nacional/noticia/la-olvidada-escuela- la-greda/603939/ In August and September 2018 there was a public health crisis in Quintero and Puchuncav√≠, where over 300 people experienced illness from toxic substances in the air, coming from the polluting industries.https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/11/chile-supreme-court-hears- massive-air-pollution-case Soil In areas near the polluting industries, testing discovered high levels of selenium and copper in the soil.DE GREGORI, I., et al. ‚ÄúComparative Study of Copper and Selenium Pollution in Agricultural Ecosystems from Valparaiso Region, Chile.‚Äù Environmental Technology, no. 3, 2000, p. 307.

In 2014 there was a spill which resulted in 37,000 liters of oil being dumped into the ocean after two tankers, the LR Mimosa and the Monobouy Terminal, connection broke. in 2015 Do√±a Carmela leaked 500 liters of oil, and in 2018 the ship Ikaros leaked slurry oil.https://news.mongabay.com/2016/10/poisoned-lives-five-decades-of- pollution-in-chiles-quintero-ventanas-bay/ Once a prosperous fishing economy and now, residents of Quintero Puchuncav√≠ say no one will buy their fish which are contaminated by heavy metals. Many fishermen have lost their jobs because of the pollution, and fisheries have been ruined.http://allinfo.space/2018/11/15/environmental-scandal-in-chile/ Reformation Efforts In 1992 there was a judicial appeal filed by several women from Puchuncavi against ENAMI Ventanas, this was filed against the refinery for the toxins it emitted.https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid;=S0718-69242017000200033 Chile's National Human Rights Institute considers Quintero and Puchunca√≠ a sacrifice zone, and after a pollution related health crisis in 2018 there has been an uproar for the right to a clean and healthy environment. This event lead to a suite against the state for violating Article 19 No. 8 of the Chilean Constitution, the right to live in a pollution free environment, plaintiffs include FIMA and the Terram Foundation.https://www.terram.cl/2018/09/organizaciones-ambientales-presentan- recurso-de-proteccion-por-contaminacion-en-quintero-y-puchuncavi/ The case is still in courts, as of April 2019.https://www.vancecenter.org/vance-center- assists-in-landmark-brief-in-chilean-supreme-court/ Government Intervention In response to the protests against the pollution of industries in the Valparaiso region the government created the National Commission of the Environment (CONAMA) https://ejatlas.org/conflict/refineria-y-fundicion-de-enami-codelco- division-ventanas The Plan of Decontamination of Windows which dealt locally with the emissions from Codelco, has been attempting to reduce emissions from the refinery. in 1965 the Interregal Regulatory Plan of Valparaiso stated that Quintero Bay was risky for human settlement. Despite this there has been an expansion of industrial and housing development. Local Organizations and Movements There are many movements in the region which have organized against the negative health impacts of the polluting agents. ASOREFEN (former Workers‚Äô Association Enami Codelco Refinery Ventanas or Regional Association of Ex Officials of Enami Ventanas) is a group of former employees of Codelco's Ventanas refinery, organized against the company's pollution. Many of the people within it are referred to as Men in Green, which is the people who were first directly exposed to the toxins, usually from working in close contact with them. Cabildo Abierto Quintero-Puchuncavi: a local organization fighting for the decontamination of the sacrificial zone. Women of Zones of Sacrifice in Resistance of Puchuncav√≠-Quintero, an organization established in 2016 in response to health crisis' like the La Gerda school poisoning. These women came together with the ideology of Latin American ecofeminism, to fight against being in a sacrifice zone. Dunas de Ritoque is a local environmental NGO in Quintero Puchuncav√≠, fighting for the preservation of the environment.https://www.dunasderitoque.org/contact-us Other Organizations involved in the health crisis of the Valpara√≠so Province include: FIMA, Ecosystems, Institute of Political Ecology (IEP), Oceana, CODEFF, Terram Foundation, Greenpeace and Sustainable Chile.

By the end of the eighteenth century it had become an almshouse charity and moved to its present buildings at the top of Star Hill. In 1975 it merged with the Richard Watts Charity. Origin In 1315 Symond Potyn left estates to fund the building of \\"a House with Appurtenances called the Spittell of St. Katherine of Rochester in the suburbe in Eastgate\\". It was intended for any \\"Man or Woman of the Cittee of Rouchester to be visited with Lepre or other such Diseasses that longe to Impotence\\". This is the leper hospital of which Richard Watts may have been thinking when he banned proctors from the Six Poor Travellers' house. The will laid down the equivalent of trustees; the Vicar of St. Nicholas, Potyn's heirs, John St. Denys and his heirs and finally the \\"Baylie of the same Cittee\\". Rules for the running of the hospital and the behaviour of the inhabitants were included. Amongst other things residents were not to \\"haunt the tavern or go to ale\\" which on the surface seems odd as Potyn was the Master of the Crown Inn. Phippen is quoted by Hinkley as remarking on the incongruity of this. Hinkley comments that perhaps as landlord Potyn had seen enough of the effects of such attendance. The hospital was duly built at the foot of Star Hill. By 1704 complaints about maladministration led to a commission of inquiry which sat at the Bull Inn. Apparently estates were being let for excessive periods at poor rates. An agreement was eventually reached which raised enough money for immediate repairs followed by a rebuild in 1717, some 400 years after the original founding. alt=A single story red-brick row with above the main door a raised parapet including a dedication plaque. In 1752 Robert Bayley left money whose dividends were distributed amongst the residents. As with all of the following gifts, a separate charity existed, in this case Bayley's Gift, from the time of the donation until all the St. Catherine's charities were amalgamated with the Richard Watts' Charity in 1977. In 1778 William Fruin likewise left money to be invested to provide an income to the almsfolk. This was Fruin's Gift. New building In 1790 Thomas Tomlyn left ¬£2,200 to provide income to the residents and to pay for the building of the present hospital at the top of Star Hill. The original specification was for 12 poor women of St. Catherine's Hospital. The capital was managed by a charity, Tomlyn's Gift, as mentioned above. Joseph Wilcocks left ¬£200 to augment Tomlyn's Gift, and a further ¬£100 to wall the new almshouse. His will of 1788 left ¬£2,700 in trust for a county hospital to be built near Rochester. In the event that one was not built, which it wasn't, the income was used to provide running costs and to augment St. Catherine's Hospital. As a result, two additional dwellings were built. The money became the separate charity Wilcock's Gift. The new building dates from 1805 and is now a grade II listed building, number 1086410, at . It is a single story building made of red brick set in English bond with a slate roof. The front wall and railings are original. alt=A terrace of red brick single story dwellings. Susanna Day left a further ¬£500 in her will of 1801. This charity, Day's Gift, provided money for the poor of St. Catherine's Hospital. The final gift in this series of charities was that of Susannah Kettle (hence Kettle's Gift) in a will dated 1815. By 1850 four new rooms had been built at the Hospital, but by 1881 outgoings were exceeding income. However, by 1884 things must have been corrected, for as well as raising the inmates' pensions, the trustees were able to pay two outpensions annually until 1899. Similar fluctuations in finances occurred during the first half of the 20th century. At the outbreak of the Second World War the inmates were evacuated, but by 1940 were requesting permission to return, something that had to await the provision of air raid shelters. Postwar finances and amalgamation In 1953 a valuation of the charity showed an annual loss of ¬£200, and reserves of ¬£600. A rearrangement of the leases regularised the position and by 1955 plans were drawn up for the modernisation of the building. A limit of 15 inmates was agreed, though by 1971 there were 17. In 1974 a proposal was made to amalgamate the charity with the Richard Watts Charity which duly occurred on 11 August 1975, thus ending 660 years of independent existence.

In order to facilitate this integration, Jewish families have been encouraged to settle in this part of the country to ‚Äúmake the desert bloom‚Äù, an oft-quoting Zionist phrase. However, these families often live in small, gated farming communities, fully serviced with water and electricity (oftentimes Bedouin villages are not hooked up to the national grid, though this has been argued as a consequence of illegal Bedouin village construction, not as a form of discrimination). These farming communities have sprung up close to the Bedouin villages.Israel's bulldozers vs the Bedouin Arabs, The Belfast Telegraph The government asserts that the bill will expand Bedouin communities, as some unrecognized communities will be recognized and receive public services, and infrastructure will be renewed, all within the framework of the Beer Sheva District masterplan. Most residents will be absorbed into the Abu Basma Regional Council and the nature of future communities, whether agricultural, rural, suburban or urban will be decided in full cooperation with the local Bedouin. For those who are to be relocated, 2/3 will receive a new residence nearby. Tirabin al-Sana's mosque (its dome taken from mosque in the previous Tarabin tribe residence place next to Omer) Further, it is indicated that the bill seeks to address the numerous land claims filed by the Bedouin, offering significant compensation in land and funds, with each claim dealt in a unified and transparent way provided by law. Criticism A United Nations committee has called for the withdrawal of the draft law that would move 30,000 Bedouin living in the Negev to permanent, existing Bedouin communities. Furthermore, the United Nations human rights chief urged Israel to reconsider a proposed law that would result in the demolition of up to 35 Bedouin villages, displacing as many as 40,000 members of these communities from their ancestral homes. ‚ÄúIf this bill becomes law, it will accelerate the demolition of entire Bedouin communities, forcing them to give up their homes, denying them their rights to land ownership, and decimating their traditional cultural and social life in the name of development,‚Äù Ms. Pillay said. According to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Law for the Regulation of the Bedouin Settlement in the Negev is discriminatory and would legalize racist practices. Further critics of Prawer Plan include an independent human rights organization and legal center, Adalah which works to promote and defend the rights of Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, as well as Palestinians living in the West Bank. The center describes the Bill - which was approved by the Israeli Knesset on 25 June 2013 with 43 votes for and 40 votes against, as discriminatory. They also say that the Arab Bedouin community totally rejects of the plan. The European Parliament heavily criticized the plan.Haaretz, 8 July 2012, European Parliament condemns Israel's policy toward Bedouin population In January 2012 hundreds of people protested the Prawer Plan in front of the Beersheba courthouse.Hundreds protest Beduin relocation plan in Beersheba, The Jerusalem Post Halt According to Israel's Haaretz newspaper, on 12 December 2013 MK Benny Begin (one of the architects of the Prawer-Begin Plan) announced that the plan will be halted.
