He was born in Enfield, New Hampshire, of Puritan stock who emigrated to the American colonies from England in 1633. His early education was in a one-room schoolhouse and later at the Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire. He entered Dartmouth College in 1899 and worked his way through college by teaching in rural areas. After his college graduation in 1902, he entered the University of Pennsylvania medical school. He graduated in 1906. He interned for one year at the City Hospital in New York City and then spent several years in general practice in New York and Connecticut. Noyes returned to Philadelphia for one year of graduate study in internal medicine and neurology, and then entered the field of psychiatry at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital. From 1916 to 1920, he was an assistant physician and executive officer at the hospital. In 1920, Noyes moved to Washington, D.C., to join the medical staff at the St. Elizabeths Hospital.

The most important holy sites of the religion are the Seven Shrines of Abkhazia, each one having its own priestly clan, where rituals and prayers began to be restored in the 1990s. According to the 2003 census, 8% of the population of Abkhazia adheres to Abkhaz neopaganism.. On 3 August 2012 the Council of Priests of Abkhazia was formally constituted in Sukhumi.. The possibility of making the Abkhaz native religion one of the state religions was discussed in the following months.. . History The traditional Abkhaz religion was actually never completely wiped out; circles of priests, whose activity was kept secret,Krylov, 1999 passed on traditional knowledge and rites in the times when Christianity and Islam became dominant in the region, and later in Soviet times of anti-religion. Such priests continued the worship of deities such as the thunder god Afy and the supreme god Antsua.. Since the 1980s, and later in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Abkhaz native religion was resurrected by the joint efforts of priests who began to resurface, rural people reactivating local rituals, and urban intellectuals supporting Paganism as an integral part for a reawakening of the Abkhaz ethnic and cultural identity.Filatov & Shipkov, 1996 A turning point for the revival of the Abkhaz native religion came with the Georgian–Abkhazian conflict.Schnirelmann, p. 205. With tensions growing, more and more Abkhazians began associating Orthodox Christianity with the Georgians, and chose to reject it, turning to the native gods. The eventual victory of Abkhazia in the 1992–93 war with Georgia catalyzed the Neopagan revival. Many Abkhaz believe that their national god Dydrypsh awarded them the victory.Schnirelmann, p. 206. Since then the Abkhaz native religion has been protected by Abkhaz authorities. Government officials took part in a bull sacrifice in October 1993 celebrated to thank the Lord Dydrypsh for the victory over the Georgians, and since then they regularly take part in worship rituals.Krylov, 1998a: 24–26; 1998b See also * Council of Priests of Abkhazia * Seven Shrines of Abkhazia ;Caucasian religions * Adyghe Habzism ;Indo-European religions * Etseg Din * Rodnovery ;Turkic religions * Tengrism * Vattisen Yaly ;Uralic religions * Estonian neopaganism * Finnish neopaganism * Mari Native Religion * Mordvin Native Religion * Udmurt Vos References Bibliography * . * . * & 7, 1998 b: 54–56. * . * . * .

Set in El Paso, Texas in 1987, the novel follows two Mexican-American teenagers, Aristotle \\"Ari\\" Mendoza and Dante Quintana, their friendship, and their struggles with racial and ethnic identity, sexuality, and family relationships. Since its publication, the novel has received near-universal critical acclaim and numerous accolades. Plot The book is divided into six sections. In each part we see the two main characters, Aristotle and Dante, discovering more about themselves, more Aristotle than Dante. =The Different Rules of Summer= > Epigraph: \\"The problem with my life was that it was someone else's idea.\\" 15-year-old Aristotle \\"Ari\\" Mendoza has no plans for the summer of 1987. He is bored, miserable, and friendless. Ari lives with his mother and his father; his two older sisters have grown up and moved away and his older brother is in prison. Everyone in Ari's family refuses to talk about his brother and behaves as if he were dead. Ari's father served in the Vietnam War, but also refuses to talk about his experiences in battle. Ari goes swimming to escape the suffocating silence of his house, even though he doesn't know how to swim. At the pool, a boy named Dante Quintana offers to teach Aristotle how to swim. The boys bond over their classical names and eventually become inseparable. Ari is fascinated by Dante's swimming ability as well as his sincerity. Dante teaches Ari about literature and poetry. He hates to wear shoes and struggles regularly with his Mexican identity. Aristotle is astounded by the affection displayed by Dante's family because he feels so distanced from his own parents. Aristotle goes with Dante and his parents to the desert so that they can look at the stars, where Dante proclaims \\"Someday, I'm going to discover all the secrets of the universe.\\" One afternoon, the boys see some children shooting birds with a BB gun. Dante and Ari confront them, take away the gun and bury the sparrow the children shot. =Sparrows Falling From the Sky= > Epigraph: \\"When I was a boy, I used to wake up thinking that the world was > ending.\\" The morning after they bury the sparrow, Ari wakes up with a terrible case of the flu. He has fevered dreams where he is in the rain and searching for Dante and his own father. He also has dreams where his imprisoned brother, Bernardo, is across a large river while Ari calls for him to return. Ari's father and mother nurse their son back to health, but his bad dreams persist. Dante sketches Ari while he recovers over the next several days. He refuses to show Ari his sketchbook, but leaves Ari a lifelike drawing of a chair as a gift. When Ari feels better, Dante tells Ari that he and his family are moving to Chicago for the next school term because his father was offered a temporary professorship at the University of Chicago. The same day that Dante announces his move, the two boys see a bird lying injured in the road. While Dante goes into the road to check on the bird, a car speeds around a corner. Ari dives into the street, pushes Dante out of the way, and is hit by the car. While Dante leaves almost unscathed, Ari is hurt very badly. =The End of Summer= > Epigraph: \\"Do you remember the summer of the rain.....You must let > everything fall that wants to fall.\\" — Karen Fiser Both of Ari's legs and his left arm are in casts. Dante only suffers minor injuries and is overcome by guilt. Ari makes his friend swear not to talk about the accident, thank him, or cry. Ari is angry when Dante cries because he believes that he should be the one crying. Following the accident, the Quintanas and the Mendozas grow closer. Both boys' mothers talk more frequently and share ideas about their sons. Dante's mother sends him to a therapist to talk about the incident. Dante visits Ari in the hospital. He brings two novels, War and Peace and The Grapes of Wrath. He also gives Ari his sketchbook, the first time he has shown anyone the book. Ari is sickened by the gesture, because he believes Dante gives him the book because he feels as if he owes Ari for saving his life. He throws the book against the hospital wall and refuses to look at it. After the incident, Ari's mother suggests that he also see a counselor. Ari lashes out and insists that he will see a therapist when she starts talking about his brother. Ari's father also visits him in the hospital every evening. Ari reads The Grapes of Wrath and his father reads War and Peace. When Ari is allowed to come home, he and his father continue to read together. Ari believes their silent reading is their own way of talking. Three weeks after the accident, Ari's father offers to buy him a car for his upcoming birthday. Ari asks for an old pick-up truck. Gradually, Ari heals and is able to bathe himself and write again. The improvement makes him happier, but he still feels suffocated in his own home and he dreads the start of the school year with Dante's absence. Before Dante leaves for Chicago, he reveals the two things he loves most in the world are swimming and Ari. However, Ari says that he shouldn't tell him those things, even if they are true. The two boys promise each other that they will still be friends when Dante returns in the summer. =Letters on a Page= > Epigraph: \\"There are some words I'll never learn to spell.\\" When school starts again, Ari is reluctant to tell his schoolmates about the accident. Two girls from his class, Gina Navarro and Susie Byrd, hound him for answers. Meanwhile, Ari's father gives him a 1957 Chevy pickup truck. He decides that when his casts come off, the first place he will drive is to the desert where he can look at the stars. Ari also becomes infatuated with Illeana, a girl from his school. He becomes intent on kissing her. Dante sends Ari several letters. In them he speaks about how he goes to parties, tries marijuana, drinks alcohol, and kisses girls. He also talks about visiting the Art Institute of Chicago where he sees one of his favorite paintings, Nighthawks by Edward Hopper. In his later letters, Dante confesses that he'd rather be kissing boys than girls. The day Ari gets his casts off, he takes a walk by Dante's house. He finds a stray dog, whom he takes home and names \\"Legs\\". Ari's life without Dante revolves around learning to drive, lifting weights, running with Legs, trying to find information about his brother at the library, arguing with Gina and Susie, trying to run into Ileana at school, reading Dante's letters, having bad dreams, and working a part-time job at a burger joint called The Charcoaler. He writes this list down in his journal. Over Christmas break, Ari finds an envelope in his house marked \\"Bernardo.\\" Ari knows that the envelope contains everything he wants to know about his brother, but he is afraid to open it. On New Year's Eve, Susie and Gina invite Ari to a party where Ileana gives him his first kiss. In the weeks after, though, Ileana tells Ari that she doesn't want to go out with him because she already has a boyfriend who is in a gang. The next Monday, Ari finds out that Ileana dropped out of school because she got married after getting pregnant. In his next letter, Dante reveals that he is scared his parents will be disappointed in him if they find out that he wants to kiss boys. On the last day of school, Ari asks Gina and Susie to drive him out to the desert so that he can get drunk. =Remember the Rain= > Epigraph: \\"turning the pages patiently in search of meanings\\" — W.S. Merwin The summer begins again and Ari begins to work full-time at the Charcoaler. Dante returns from Chicago and the two boys take Ari's truck to the desert. Dante reveals that his mother is pregnant. He hopes that the new baby will be a boy so that the boy can marry a woman and have children. While Ari has no problem with Dante's sexuality and will stand by him, he makes it clear he doesn't want Dante trying to kiss him either. One night, Dante convinces Ari to kiss him, saying it is an experiment as he has never kissed another boy and wants to know if he feels anything from kissing Ari. While reluctant, Ari agrees and Dante kisses him with Ari briefly kissing him back. Afterwards, Ari claims to have felt nothing while Dante is upset as he felt something with the kiss, seeming to confirm Dante has feelings for Ari. Following this event, it becomes increasingly clear that Dante is in love with Ari who appears not to reciprocate Dante's feelings for him. Ari's mother goes to Tucson to visit his Aunt Ophelia leaving Ari and his father alone for a few days. Gina and Susie stop by the drugstore where Dante works, where he tells them about how Ari saved his life. Ari is furious that Dante broke their rule of not speaking about the accident. Dante brings along two joints the next time he and Ari drive out to the desert and the two of them get high. Dante tells Ari that he likes a boy with whom he works named Daniel. It starts raining while they are in the truck. Both boys take off their clothes and run naked in the rain. The next morning, Ari's father announces that Aunt Ophelia had had a fatal stroke. The two of them drive to Tucson. Ari remembers staying with his aunt for several months when he was younger. He asks his father why he was left to live with his aunt, and his father tells him that during Bernardo's trial, Ari's mother had a mental breakdown. Ari had to be sent away so that his Aunt Ophelia could take care of him. At the funeral, Ari realizes that none of his extended family is there. He is told that they disapproved of Aunt Ophelia having lived with another woman for many years. Ari's own parents are angry that she was estranged from the rest of the family because of her sexual orientation. After the funeral, Ari's mother offers to finally tell him all about Bernardo. =All the Secrets of the Universe= > Epigraph: \\"Through all of youth I was looking for you without knowing what I > was looking for.\\" — W.S. Merwin Ari's mother explains that Bernardo was arrested for murder. When he was fifteen years old, he hired a prostitute off of the street. The prostitute was transgender, whom an infuriated Bernardo killed with his bare fists. He is in prison for life. When Ari returns home, Mr. Quintana tells him that Dante is in the hospital. He was jumped by several young men who had seen him kissing Daniel in an alley. Ari goes to Dante's work and confronts Daniel, finding out the names of two of the men who attacked Dante. Ari visits one of them, Julian, at the body shop where he works and starts a fight with him. Ari nearly ends up in trouble for what happened, but his father stands by him when he explains and Ari avoids having to pay Julian's hospital bills. His mother, who was afraid of Ari ending up like his brother, seems to gain an understanding of something that Ari misses after he explains how he beat up Julian because of his anger towards him for attacking Dante over kissing another boy. After the attack, Mr. Quintana asks if Ari knows why Dante was jumped. Ari tells him that Dante is gay and was kissing another boy. He also explains that Dante hadn't told his parents out of fear of their reactions, but Mr. Quintana along with his wife is supportive of his son. Mr. Quintana admits that he'd guessed the truth because of the way Dante looks at Ari, while Mrs. Quintana tells Ari she thinks Dante is in love with him. Ari admits that's true, but believes that Dante has moved onto Daniel. Mrs. Quintana shares her belief that Daniel is just a stand-in for Ari. When Dante comes home from the hospital, Daniel starts visiting him in his house. This angers Ari because Daniel ran away while Dante was being beaten up. Dante admits to Ari that when he kisses Daniel, he imagines he's Ari, but Ari just tells Dante he needs to get a new head. Dante is left upset by Ari's reaction to Dante all but admitting his love for him. Ari's mother eventually calls a family meeting where she gets Ari's father to finally tell him about an incident in the Vietnam War that has haunted him. Ari's father tells him it's time they both stopped running, saying that Dante loves Ari. Ari is aware of this but thinks Dante has gotten over it. Ari's father explains that what Ari's running from, what will kill him if he keeps running, is that Ari loves Dante too. When Ari denies it, his father tells Ari that his instincts in saving Dante's life while risking his own and taking revenge on Julian point to Ari loving Dante more than he can bear. After his father's explanation, Ari finally accepts this, and breaks down, ashamed of loving another boy. However, his parents support him and his mother uses his Aunt Ophelia as an example. Ari's father reminds Ari of how when things got tough when Julian and his friends attacked him, Dante didn't run. At that moment, Ari and his father finally reach an understanding of each other. That night, Ari, Dante, and their parents go bowling together. Having accepted that he loves Dante, Ari is now a lot happier, especially when Dante reveals he realized Ari was right about Daniel. After bowling, Dante and Ari go out into the desert, where Dante tells Ari they can't be friends anymore because it's too hard for him when Dante loves him and Ari doesn't love him back. Rather than running from his feelings, Ari reminds Dante of their kiss and how he said it didn't work for him before finally admitting he lied about it. Ari asks Dante to kiss him again but Dante refuses, challenging Ari to kiss him instead. Without hesitation, Ari kisses Dante, fully accepting his love for him. Following the kiss, Dante and Ari relax in the back of Ari's truck. Ari reflects that he'd been searching for the secrets of the universe and his own body and heart when the answers were with him the whole time in the form of his love for Dante. Ari now knows that he'd been in love with Dante from the moment they met, but didn't let himself know, think or feel it. Now free of his fears, Ari is left wondering: \\"How could I ever have been ashamed of loving Dante Quintana?\\" Themes Several themes feature prominently in Aristotle and Dante. These include Mexican- American identity, gender and sexuality, particular masculine gender roles and homosexuality, intellectualism and artistic expression, as well as family relationships and friendship. Critical reception and accolades The book has been a critical success, with a Publishers Weekly review calling it \\"a tender, honest exploration of identity and sexuality, and a passionate reminder that love—whether romantic or familial—should be open, free, and without shame\\". The book has won numerous awards, including the Lambda Literary Award and Stonewall Book Award for LGBT fiction, an Amelia Elizabeth Walden Award honor, Pura Belpré Narrative Medal for Latino fiction, and Michael L. Printz Award honor for Young Adult fiction. The book has been positively received by readers as well; in May 2016, more than four years after its publication, it ranked first on a list of popular LGBT fiction on Goodreads. In an interview with NPR, Sáenz himself noted that \\"I've never had a book with this kind of response, not ever\\" and notes that \\"[Ari] is so afraid of loving [Dante]. And Dante isn't.\\" There are plans for the book to be adapted for the screen by filmmaker Henry Alberto. Sáenz announced in 2016 that there will be a sequel titled There Will Be Other Summers. In 2020, Sáenz tweeted that he had finished the sequel and changed the title, but has not yet revealed what the title is.  Audiobook  An audiobook version of the novel was released in 2013. Read by Lin-Manuel Miranda, it has a total running time of seven hours and twenty-nine minutes.

He was its president and chief executive from 1969 to 1980.  Biography  Wolf was born on April 30, 1927 in San Francisco. His father, who was a photographer, took up employment with RKO Pictures in Los Angeles soon after he was born. His family moved to the eastern part of the US in the early 1930s, and settled in New York City. Wolf attended the Bentley School in Manhattan and The Bronx High School of Science, from which he graduated in 1943. In 1942–43, while still a student, he performed as a voice actor in a number of radio network programs. When the family moved to Los Angeles, he found employment at the RKO studio as a draftsman and sketch artist. He left RKO to enrol at Los Angeles City College but left when he was drafted into military service in the air force. Wolf was assigned to Washington DC, where he wrote for and was assistant producer of the Air Force Band's weekly national radio program. After his discharge, he enrolled at UC Berkeley, where he majored in dramatic art, with a minor in historical decorative arts.  Career  After graduation, he became an instructor in theatrical arts at Saint Mary's College of California from 1952 to 1953, and at his alma mater in 1953. In 1955 Wolf started earning his living working in many capacities in a hi-fi shop in Berkeley where he met many early hi-fi pioneers, including Rudy Bozak, Joe Grado and Will Rayment. He partnered with Sargent-Rayment, designing the visuals for their tube electronics. Although the first product was not a commercial success, his later designs gained attention. = Industrial designer = He set up his own industrial-design practice in Berkeley in 1957. After initially running it out of his own home for three years, he moved it to premises in downtown Berkeley. An early client of Arnold Wolf Associates was James B. Lansing Sound (JBL) in Los Angeles, for whom he designed a number of products. Wolf's first assignment for JBL was a bookshelf loudspeaker project that finally bore the name D42020 'Bel-Aire'. One of Wolf's most celebrated designs was the D44000 Paragon loudspeaker, based on an original concept by Richard Ranger, which instantly became an icon upon its release. When JBL decided to enter into production of audio electronics to complement its speaker range, Wolf was commissioned to work on the new products. In 1968 Wolf redesigned the JBL company logo, which continues to be in use forty years on. In 1969, JBL was acquired by the Jervis Corporation (later renamed Harman International), who designated Wolf JBL's new head. Wolf then disengaged from his industrial design practice and to moved his family to Hollywood. = JBL = Amongst the many milestones achieved under his presidency at JBL was the launch of the JBL L100 (nicknamed \\"Century\\") loudspeaker with its distinctive grille in 1970. The product, notable for its innovatively coloured and \\"waffle-pattern\\" moulded grilles and white-coloured woofers, became the best-selling speaker of the 1970s. Wolf left JBL in 1980, after which he resumed his industrial design practice. In 1984/85 he was professor of Design at California State University, Long Beach. He retired from his design practice 1987.  Death  Wolf died on April 23, 2013 in his home in Pacific Grove. He is survived by his two sons and one daughter.

Career In addition to Concordia Parish, Crothers' senatorial district included the Mississippi River delta parishes of East Carroll, Madison, and Tensas. In both terms his district colleague was Andrew L. Sevier of Tallulah, a senator from 1932 until his death in office in 1962. Voters from the four parishes at the time elected two senators. That system changed by 1972, with implementation of the United States Supreme Court decision, Reynolds v. Sims, which mandates one man, one vote in state legislative districting. Crothers served as president of the Louisiana Cattleman's Association and as a second vice-president of the American National Cattleman's Association. In 1967, long after he had left the state Senate, Crothers lobbied U.S. Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, in support of import restrictions on beef. In his statement before Long's committee, Crothers noted that Louisiana in 1966 had 45,000 herds of cattle and that beef was the number one agricultural product in the state. He questioned how domestic beef producers, with high costs, wages, and taxes, could be expected to compete with foreign imports of cattle grown with a cheap, inferior feed. Crothers also noted that the beef industry is the largest user of subsidized feed grain, but he warned that \\"the cattle industry is becoming a sick industry.\\"Brenham Crothers statement, United States Senate, Import Quotas Legislation: Hearings Before the Committee on Finance, October 20, 1967 The Brenham C.

Crothers' brother was Will Woffard \\"Billy\\" Crothers (1909-1969). His nephew, Albert Baucum \\"Bubba\\" Crothers (1942-2008), was in the insurance business in Ferriday for thirty-five years prior to his move to Georgetown, Texas. Crothers was married to the former Berta Hammett (1908-1993), daughter of Berta Wells Hammett (1881-1952) and Albert Galloway Hammett, Sr. (1881-1974), a native of Campti in Natchitoches Parish, who was from 1933 to 1964 the tax assessor of Caddo Parish.

Christopher Sheridan of Band Wagon Magazine describes the song as starting off slowly while rising up gradually and setting the tone for the momentum the band is known for, with Lauren Brown from Rock on Philly comparing lead vocalist Alisa Xayalith's resonant vocals to those of Yeah Yeah Yeahs front woman Karen Orzolek. Brown went on to say that the song did not portray the ensemble's electropop talent.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and was designed by the Boller Brothers. History The Granada Theatre was constructed in 1929 at a cost of $350,000 ($ in dollars). The theatre was dedicated on October 3, 1929, in a speech by “The Sage of Emporia,” William Allen White. During its early years, the theatre attracted many famous performers. In addition to screening movies, it was used for everything from beauty contests to traveling vaudeville acts. It was leased for many years to the Fox Corporation and became known as the Fox Theatre. Architect Robert O. Boller, of Boller Brothers, Architects, designed the Granada Theatre. Boller Brothers were nationally known theatre designers with offices in Kansas City and Los Angeles. Like many grand old movie palaces of its era, the Granada's popularity declined during the 1960s and 70s. During this period, the building suffered from neglect and damage resulting from a leaking roof. It was closed in 1982. In April 1985, the theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, but, it was not until demolition threatened the building in 1994 that a group of citizens rallied to save the theatre. In cooperation with the Kansas Preservation Alliance, the Emporia Granada Theatre Alliance was formed and acquired the building, saving it from destruction. Since then, the Alliance members and numerous volunteers have spent countless hours stabilizing and renovating the outside of the building and preparing for the interior phase of the project. Working cooperatively with other local arts, cultural and tourism organizations, the Alliance has developed a plan to make the Granada Theatre a keystone facility – a place that builds community. Emporia Granada Theatre Logo Board of directors When the Emporia Granada Theatre Alliance bought the Granada Theatre in 1994, they set up a Board of Directors to oversee everything done at the theatre. They raised money for renovating the theatre, as well. The Director of the Granada Theatre, Brian Williams, also reports to them.

The complex also housed the fire station, the firemen's married accommodation, the single constables' accommodation, the police station, the magistrates' court and administration offices. The Hereford Police Station was a former gaol in Gaol Street, Hereford. It was built in 1841The history of the Hereford Police Station, www.heritage-explorer.co.uk.

The basement housed six cells, a restraining cell and police offices which were used when the court was sitting. A short staircase led from here to the witness box in the courtroom. Chief Constable Richardson in his new position had a large range of duties ranging from the licensing of hackney carriages to being inspector of contagious diseases and a requirement to always appear in uniform.Hereford City Records, Herefordshire County Record Office, Hereford. City fire departments were in their infancy in 1883 and for an individual to lead both the police and fire departments was an innovation in Hereford. Soon after his arrival, he wrote to the Mayor of Hereford referring to the possible appointment of seven men as firemen.Richardson Private Family Archives. Up until this time policemen carried out fire- fighting, and he wanted a new situation whereby if policemen arrived first at a fire, they would fight the fire but give way to the firemen when they arrived. The letter also suggests that both the police officers and the seven new firemen men should receive training as fire-fighters. This was agreed by the Watch Committee of Hereford City Council.Hereford City Council Records, County Record Office, Hereford. After further discussion, the seven fire fighters were integrated into the police force, using them as constables when there were no fires to be fought. Richardson also introduced a new grey uniform for the fire fighters.Examples held by the Hereford City Museum.

He distributed hand-held \\"fire extinguishers\\", patented in 1868, to public and larger buildings. These contained about a gallon of water in a sealed glass container within a smaller metal canister. There was a weak point created at the top of the glass and the idea was to throw it on the fire where it would spray water. In 1907 a severe fire broke out at Rotherwas House, a country gentleman's mansion with an historic chapel, just outside the city limits. Richardson broke the councils rules by rushing to the scene and prevented the blaze from spreading.This event brought much praise from the owner of Rotherwas and later the council to Richardson. The story leading up to the fire brigade's decision to tackle the blaze received much publicity at the time and the details were reprinted in a Hereford City exhibition of 2007. Horses pulled fire engines in Hereford until 1908 when a motorized unit was purchased. As a further refinement the 1912 \\"list of beats\\" for the city police showed that certain city centre night beats were designated \\"fire escape beats\\". These were the areas with a higher risk of fire and ensured a rapid response for the heart of the city. This arrangement continued until the 1930s.Hereford City Watch Committee records, County Record Office, Hereford. The officers on the special beat list occupied a row of houses in DeLacy Street, adjacent to the police and fire stations. It does underline the city police’s role as a dual law and order and fire-fighting organization, with Frank Richardson being in charge of both organizations. Like many Chief Constables, Richardson often acted a prosecutor at the magistrates' court, so he could be out fighting fires during the night and prosecuting in court the following day. A Report by the Chief Constable was published by the Magistrates Clerk from the Hereford Watch Committee on 2 September 1898 which went into great detail concerning the Licensing of premises in Hereford. The Annual Police Return for 1899 was presented by the Magistrates Clerk from the Hereford Watch Committee who read the contents as supplied by the Head Constable, Frank Richardson, at a Session following a speech by the Bishop of Hereford who was concerned about the number of licensed premises in the city and the serving of children.The Annual Police Return for 1899 was presented in September and submitted by the Magistrates Clerk.

The Library Board holds meetings that are open to the public and makes recommendations to the City Commission concerning operating policy of McAllen Public Library and long- range capital improvement planning. History McAllen Public Library's beginnings can be traced back to 1932, when the McAllen Study Club opened a one-room library at the McAllen Chamber of Commerce. The new library was open on Saturdays and the first librarian was Miss Elinor Hambrick. In 1934, the library relocated to First Baptist Church before being relocated again in 1936 to the basement of the Archer Park Bandstand. In 1944, the library was granted municipal status and embarked on a fund drive for a new building. In 1949, construction begins after the site at the corner of Main Street and Fir Street are chosen for a new building. On May 28, 1950, the McAllen Memorial Library opened for business and was dedicated as a memorial to McAllen residents who died in World War II. Mrs. Ruth Abbott became the first librarian at McAllen Memorial Library. Additions were made to the structure in 1957 and included an auditorium, youth room, and a periodical room. Expansion continued in 1967 with a new wing that included the circulation desk and a second floor mezzanine. By 1976, complete second and third floors had been added to the north side of the building. McAllen citizens elected to implement a half-cent sales tax for economic development in May 1997, which led to the construction of two new library branches. During the fall of 1999, construction began on the two branch libraries in the north and south areas of McAllen. On January 18, 2001, the Lark Branch Library and the Palm View Branch Library opened their doors to the public. MPL celebrated its 75th anniversary on November 12, 2007 and prepared for construction of a new building at the intersection of Nolana Avenue and 23rd Street. After serving the public for 61 years, the Old Main Library (McAllen Memorial Library) closed its doors for the last time on November 23, 2011. On December 10, 2011, the New Main Library opened its doors to the public. Locations =Headquarters= Main Library exists inside a former Walmart big box store. Opened in December 2011, it is the largest single-floor library in the United States, occupying , or two and a half times the area of a standard US football playing field. The design, by Meyer Scherer & Rockcastle Ltd. (MSR) of Minneapolis, won the International Interior Design Association (IIDA) 2012 Library Interior Design Competition. In 2013, the design also won the Honor Award for Interior Architecture, which is the highest honor for interior design awarded by the American Institute of Architects (AIA). The awards selection jury noted that \\"The interior spaces have been dramatically transformed from a warehouse to a place with a sense of intimacy.\\" The building addresses sustainable design, including careful materials selection for optimal indoor air quality, use of recycled materials, energy and water conservation, and ease of community access. The new library has a spacious layout featuring an art gallery, 16 public meeting spaces, 14 public study rooms, a quiet reading room, 64 computers in the general computer lab, a computer lab for teenagers, a children’s computer lab, and two genealogy computers. The building also includes self check-out units for borrowers, an auditorium, an art gallery, a used bookstore, an outdoor Dewey Decimal Learning Trail, and a cafe. The new library appears to be popular; new user registrations increased by 23 percent in the first month since its opening. =Branch libraries= In addition to the Main Library, there are two branch libraries. The Lark Branch Library is the north branch located at 2601 Lark Avenue and the Palm View Branch is the south branch located at 3401 Jordan Avenue. =Former locations= McAllen Memorial Library (Old Main Library) was located at 601 North Main Street and closed its doors on November 23, 2011. =Partnership libraries= MPL forms part of the Hidalgo County Library System.

Background =Writing and recording= Writing of the album began in 2011, when the band debuted unreleased new songs while touring for their first album, Native Speaker. Some of the songs played on the tour are; \\"Victoria\\" and \\"In Kind\\" survived to be included on Flourish // Perish. A third song, \\"Deep Running\\", was released for free on YouTube on 28 April 2014. The band invested most of 2012 recording the album in the band's garage in Montreal (which they converted into a recording studio) and at the Centre Phi. Keyboardist Katie Lee left the band at an unspecified point during the year, though she featured extensively on the album. The band discussed the direction of the album in May 2012, hinting it would be electronic-based. The change in sound grew out of the band's dissatisfaction with the constraints of guitars and acoustic drums. In April 2013, Raphaelle Standell-Preston revealed the band had abandoned guitars and that closing track \\"In Kind\\" (performed live with guitars on the Native Speaker tour) was the only song on the album which featured the instrument. Much of the songwriting took place on a computer and unlike while recording Native Speaker, the band \\"embraced the more emotional side of things, rather than trying to be super technically proficient\\". The band decided against recording live and instead recorded the songs sequentially, laying down the instrumental parts separately.Braids Band music interview about recording process of Flourish Perish and tour 2013 – Swide The band wrote between 13 and 14 songs and considered releasing the material as two EPs before agreeing to release a 10-track album. Mixing was completed in January 2013, with the mastering handled by Harris Newman at Grey Market Mastering in February. The album title and track list were announced in May 2013. The album was preceded by the In Kind // Amends EP, released on June 11, 2013. =Musical style and influences= When asked about the band's new sound, Standell-Preston stated: \\"We made up a genre called natural electronica. Natural components making up electronic music. Like the voice and drums, more organic elements combined with electronic. We are very much electronic in the way we composed the last record, using the computer. Aside from the drums and my voice it’s all super synthesized. Natural electronica\\". The singer explained that the band's stylistic change evolved because \\"over the two years that we toured Native Speaker, we became really heavily into and inspired by electronic music, we listened to so much of it. It's strikingly beautiful, it's very amazing and to me it reflects where we have gone to as a human race in 2013 and our involvement with the iPhone and laptops and everybody being interconnected\\". The band cited Baths, Azeda Booth, Aphex Twin, Autechre, Radiohead (Kid A, The King of Limbs), Portishead (Third), Max Cooper, Massive Attack (\\"Teardrop\\"), Stephen Bodsen, James Blake, Pantha du Prince, Born Gold, Goombay Dance Band and a number of Warp Records artists as influences for the album. =Title and themes= During the making of the album, the band felt that five of the songs sounded \\"pop\\" and \\"upbeat\\", while the remainder were cold, introspective and more electronic. Standell-Preston and Austin Tufts explained that the title Flourish // Perish was a reflection of the two sides of the album and the difficult time the band had creating it: \\"We started off as four people, we let Katie go and felt depressed and lost. Then we picked ourselves up and did it. We continued to write music and things just got amazing. Everything that we went through, it also calls upon the two main states of life, flourishing and perishing. You’re born, you flourish, you flourish to perish\\". Contemplative and sombre emotions are present on the album, which arose from the sadness, regret and doubt following the departure of Lee. Regarding the song \\"Together\\", Standell-Preston stated that it \\"is just about really missing her (Lee) and wondering if we can do it as the three of us and feeling really, really scared\\". \\"Amends\\" was also influenced by the conflict between Standell- Preston and Lee, while \\"Victoria\\" documents Standell-Preston's \\"crazy bouts of depression\\". \\"Hossak\\" is described as \\"a requiem for a friend who succumbed to LSD\\". = Artwork = Designer Marc Rimmer created the album's cover art, a floating black orb. The band explained that the new music lacked colour and that the stark image \\"represents the record's dependence and experimentation with technology\\". The artwork was nominated for the 2013 Best Art Vinyl award.  Legacy  The band view the Flourish // Perish period as one of struggle. Austin Tufts remarked in April 2015 that \\"the whole process was a struggle from the get-go. We started writing it with four people, ended up parting ways with Katie – the whole thing was a struggle. Learning how to play those songs live was a struggle. Touring those songs and trying to inject some sort of live energy into a record that was solely created, for the most part, using a computer, with three people\\". The band also felt \\"limited\\" by using computers and recording in the confines of their garage in Montreal. Critical reception Upon its release, the album received generally good reviews from music critics. Aggregating website AnyDecentMusic? reported a score of 7.6 based on 16 professional reviews.

It was formerly also found near the town of Shoreham-by-Sea in the county of West Sussex, but has long been extinct there. Habitat: rough grassland, clayey banks and cliffs near the sea. It is a glabrous perennial with stems up to 2 m in height, solid, striate, sometimes weakly angled, sparsely blotched wine red, surrounded by fibrous remains of petioles at the base and springing from a stout rootstock. The umbels of greenish-yellow flowers contrast pleasingly with the bushy, radiating mass of dark green, long-petioled leaves, which bear linear, sessile lobes, attenuate at both ends and having narrow, cartilaginous margins (i.e., individual lobes resembling blades of grass).\\"Umbellifers of the British Isles Tutin T.G. BSBI Handbook No.2. Pub. Botanical Society of the British Isles,1980. Peucedanum officinale has been known as a medicinal plant in Britain since at least the 17th century and features in the herbals of Nicholas Culpeper (in whose day it was more plentiful, for he records it as growing abundantly on Faversham marshes) and John Gerard. Culpepper records the additional common names hoar strange, hoar strong, (compare German \\"Haarstrang\\", meaning hog's tail) brimstonewort and sulphurwort. The long stout taproot - 'black without and white within' and sometimes 'as big as a man's thigh', as Gerard has it - yields, when incised in Spring, a considerable quantity of a yellowish-green latex, which dries into a gummy oleoresin and retains the strong, sulphurous scent of the root. This harvesting technique, and the product so obtained, very much recall those of two other medicinal umbellifers: Ferula assa-foetida and Dorema ammoniacum.A Modern Herbal Grieve,M.,Pub.1931,Jonathan Cape Ltd.,reprinted 1974 and 1975.The Englishman's Flora,Grigson,G.,Pub.

Recently however this metaphor has been subject of quantitative formulation using complex systems concepts such as criticality, meaning that a healthy ecosystem is in some sort of balance between adaptability (randomness) and robustness (order) . Nevertheless the universality of criticality is still under examination and is known as the Criticality Hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamic regime shifting between order and disorder, attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade- off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cell and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have great interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasizing its role as a viable candidate general law in the realm of adaptive complex systems (see and references therein).  Meaning  The term ecosystem health has been employed to embrace some suite of environmental goals deemed desirable.Slocombe, D. Scott (1998). \\"Defining Goals and Criteria for Ecosystem-Based Management.\\" Environmental Management 22:483–493 Edward Grumbine's highly cited paperGrumbine, R. Edward (1994). \\"What is ecosystem management?\\" Conservation Biology 8:27-38 \\"What is ecosystem management?\\" surveyed ecosystem management and ecosystem health literature and summarized frequently encountered goal statements: * Conserving viable populations of native species * Conserving ecosystem diversity * Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes * Managing over long time frames to maintain evolutionary potential * Accommodating human use and occupancy within these constraints Grumbine describes each of these goals as a \\"value statement\\" and stresses the role of human values in setting ecosystem management goals. It is the last goal mentioned in the survey, accommodating humans, that is most contentious. \\"We have observed that when groups of stakeholders work to define … visions, this leads to debate over whether to emphasize ecosystem health or human well-being … Whether the priority is ecosystems or people greatly influences stakeholders' assessment of desirable ecological and social states.\\"Leslie, heather M. and Karen L. McLeod (2007). \\"Confronting the challenges of implementing marine ecosystem-based management.\\" Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment 5:540-548. and, for example, \\"For some, wolves are critical to ecosystem health and an essential part of nature, for others they are a symbol of government overreach threatening their livelihoods and cultural values.\\"Myers, Andrew (2015). Which wolf, which trap? Socially constructing wolves and trapping in western Montana. Scholar Works, University of Montana, Oral Presentations. Measuring ecosystem health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, a vision for ecosystem health of Lake Superior was developed by a public forum and a series of objectives were prepared for protection of habitat and maintenance of populations of some 70 indigenous fish species.Horns, W.H., et al. (2003). Fish-community objectives for Lake Superior. Great Lakes Fish. Commission Special Publication. 03-01. 78 pages. A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish tissue contaminants, etc.Shear, Harvey et al. (2003). \\"The development and implementation of indicators of ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Basin.\\" Journal of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment 88:119–152 Some authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state \\"prior to the onset of anthropogenic stress.\\"Rapport, David J. and • Luisa Maffi (2011). \\"Eco-cultural health, global health, and sustainability.\\" Ecological Research 26:1039-1049 A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, fossil and pollen records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem reshuffle through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or \\"healthy.\\".Wicklum, D. and Ronald W. Davies (1995). \\"Ecosystem health and integrity?\\" Canadian Journal of Botany 73:997-1000. A commonly cited broad definition states that a healthy ecosystem has three attributes: # productivity, # resilience, and # \\"organization\\" (including biodiversity). While this captures significant ecosystem properties, a generalization is elusive as those properties do not necessarily co-vary in nature. For example, there is not necessarily a clear or consistent relationship between productivity and species richness.Adler, Peter et al. (2011). \\"Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness.\\" Science 333:1750-1752. Similarly, the relationship between resilience and diversity is complex, and ecosystem stability may depend upon one or a few species rather than overall diversity.Ives, Anthony R. and Stephen R. Carpenter (2007). \\"Stability and Diversity of Ecosystems.\\" Science 317:58-62. And some undesirable ecosystems are highly productive.Asanova, Umut (2002). \\"Philosophy of ecological ethics education, considering the Issyk-Kul Lake reediation mechanisms.\\" Jean Klerkx and Beishen Imanakanov (2002). Lake Issk-Kul: Its natural Environment Springer Science \\"Resilience is not desirable per se. There can be highly resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated coral reefs.\\" Ecological resilience is a \\"capacity\\" that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered and how they are to be quantified. Approaches to assessing it \\"face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research.\\" Other authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time. One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x system resilience.Costanza, R. 1992. \\"Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health.\\" Pp 239-256 in Costanza, R., B. Norton, and B. Haskell. Ecosystem health. New Goals for Environmental Management. Washington DC: Island Press. Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ \\"nonsense units,\\" the indices have \\"no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown.\\"Suter, Glenn W. (1993). \\"A critique of ecosystem health concepts and indexes.\\" Environmental toxicology and chemistry 12:1533-1539.  Health indicators  Health metrics are determined by stakeholder goals, which drive ecosystem definition. An ecosystem is an abstraction.Jax, Kurt (2007). \\"Can we define ecosystems? On the confusion between definition and description of ecological concepts.\\" Acta Biotheor 55:341–355O'Neill, Robert V. (2001). \\"Is it time to bury the ecosystem concept? (with full military honors, of course!)\\" Ecology 82:3275–3284 \\"Ecosystems cannot be identified or found in nature. Instead, they must be delimited by an observer. This can be done in many different ways for the same chunk of nature, depending on the specific perspectives of interest.\\" Ecosystem definition determines the acceptable range of variability (reference conditions) and determines measurement variables. The latter are used as indicators of ecosystem structure and function, and can be used as indicators of \\"health\\". An indicator is a variable, such as a chemical or biological property, that when measured, is used to infer trends in another (unmeasured) environmental variable or cluster of unmeasured variables (the indicandum). For example, rising mortality rate of canaries in a coal mine is an indicator of rising carbon monoxide levels. Rising chlorophyll-a levels in a lake may signal eutrophication.Wright, David A. and Pamela Welbourne (2002) Environmental Toxicology. Cambridge University Press. Ecosystem assessments employ two kinds of indicators, descriptive indicators and normative indicators. \\"Indicators can be used descriptively for a scientific purpose or normatively for a political purpose.\\"Heink, Ulrich and Ingo Kowarik (2010) \\"What are indicators? On the definition of indicators in ecology and environmental planning.\\" Ecological Indicators 10:584–593 Used descriptively, high chlorophyll-a is an indicator of eutrophication, but it may also be used as an ecosystem health indicator. When used as a normative (health) indicator, it indicates a rank on a health scale, a rank that can vary widely depending on societal preferences as to what is desirable. A high chlorophyll-a level in a natural successional wetland might be viewed as healthy whereas a human- impacted wetland with the same indicator value may be judged unhealthy.Costanza, Robert, and Michael Mageau (1999). \\"What is a healthy ecosystem?\\" Aquatic Ecology 33: 105–115 Estimation of ecosystem health has been criticized for intermingling the two types of environmental indicators.Carolan, Michael (2006). \\"The values and vulnerabilities of metaphors within the environmental sciences.\\" Society and Natural Resources 19:921–930 A health indicator is a normative indicator, and if conflated with descriptive indicators \\"implies that normative values can be measured objectively, which is certainly not true. Thus, implicit values are insinuated to the reader, a situation which has to be avoided.\\" It can be argued that the very act of selecting indicators of any kind is biased by the observer's perspectiveJax, Kurt (2005). \\"Function and 'functioning' in ecology: what does it mean?\\" Oikos 111:3 but separation of goals from descriptions has been advocated as a step toward transparency: \\"A separation of descriptive and normative indicators is essential from the perspective of the philosophy of science … Goals and values cannot be deduced directly from descriptions … a fact that is emphasized repeatedly in the literature of environmental ethics … Hence, we advise always specifying the definition of indicators and propose clearly distinguishing ecological indicators in science from policy indicators used for decision-making processes.\\" And integration of multiple, possibly conflicting, normative indicators into a single measure of \\"ecosystem health\\" is problematic. Using 56 indicators, \\"determining environmental status and assessing marine ecosystems health in an integrative way is still one of the grand challenges in marine ecosystems ecology, research and management\\"Borja A, et al. (2014). \\"Tales from a thousand and one ways to integrate marine ecosystem components when assessing the environmental status.\\" Frontiers in Marine Science. 1:72 Another issue with indicators is validity. Good indicators must have an independently validated high predictive value, that is high sensitivity (high probability of indicating a significant change in the indicandum) and high specificity (low probability of wrongly indicating a change). The reliability of various health metrics has been questionedWoodward, Guy, et al. (2012). Continental-wide effects of nutrient pollution on stream ecosystem functioning. Science, 336:1448-1440. and \\"what combination of measurements should be used to evaluate ecosystems is a matter of current scientific debate.\\"Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). \\"The heartbeat of ecosystems.\\" Science 336:1393-1394. Most attempts to identify ecological indicators have been correlative rather than derived from prospective testing of their predictive valueBarton, Philip S. et al. (2015). \\"Learning from clinical medicine to improve the use of surrogates in ecology.\\" Oikos 124:391-398. and the selection process for many indicators has been based upon weak evidence or has been lacking in evidence.Ahmed A.H. et al. (2016). \\"How do ecologists select and use indicator species to monitor ecological change? Insights from 14 years of publication in Ecological Indicators.\\" Ecological Indicators 60:223-230. In some cases no reliable indicators are known: \\"We found no examples of invertebrates successfully used in [forest] monitoring programs. Their richness and abundance ensure that they play significant roles in ecosystem function but thwart focus on a few key species.\\" And, \\"Reviews of species-based monitoring approaches reveal that no single species, nor even a group of species, accurately reflects entire communities. Understanding the response of a single species may not provide reliable predictions about a group of species even when the group is a few very similar species.\\"Kremsater, Laurie L. and Fred L.

(2008). \\"Ecosystem energetic implications of parasite and free-living biomass in three estuaries.\\" Nature 454:515-518. The very choice of the word \\"health\\" applied to ecology has been questioned as lacking in neutrality in a BioScience article on responsible use of scientific language: \\"Some conservationists fear that these terms could endorse human domination of the planet … and could exacerbate the shifting cognitive baseline whereby humans tend to become accustomed to new and often degraded ecosystems and thus forget the nature of the past.\\"Kueffer, Christoph and Brendon M. H. Larson (2014). \\"Responsible Use of Language in Scientific Writing and Science Communication.\\" BioScience 64(8): 719–724.  Criticism of the concept and proposed alternatives  Criticism of ecosystem health largely targets the failure of proponents to explicitly distinguish the normative (policy preference) dimension from the descriptive (scientific information) dimension, and has included the following: * Ecosystem health is in the eye of the beholder. It is an economic, political or ethical judgement rather than a scientific measure of environmental quality. Health ratings are shaped by the goals and preferences of environmental stakeholders.Lancaster, Jill (2000). \\"The Ridiculous Notion of Assessing Ecological Health and Identifying the Useful Concepts Underneath.\\"Human and Ecological Risk Assessment 6: 213-222Carolan, Michael S.

(2003) Managing for Healthy Ecosystems Boca Raton, Florida: Lewis Publishers, , 1510 pages. * Health is a metaphor, not a property of an ecosystem. Health is an abstraction. It implies \\"good\\", an optimum condition, but in nature ecosystems are ever-changing transitory assemblages with no identifiable optimum.Calow, P. (1992).\\" Can ecosystems be healthy? Critical consideration of concepts.\\" Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Health 1:1-5. * Use of human health and well- being as a criterion of ecosystem health introduces an arrogance and a conflict of interest into environmental assessment, as human population growth has caused much environmental damage.Stanley, Thomas R. Jr. (1995). \\"Ecosystem management and the arrogance of humanism.\\" Conservation Biology 9:255-262 * Ecosystem health masquerades as an operational goal because environmental managers \\"may be reluctant to define their goals clearly.\\" * It is a vague concept.Duarte, Carlos M. et al. (2015). \\"Paradigms in the recovery of estuarine and coastal ecosystems.\\" Estuaries and Coasts 38:1202-1212 \\"Currently there are many, often contradictory, definitions of ecosystem health,\\" that \\"are open to so much abuse and misuse that they represent a threat to the environment.\\" * \\"There are in general no clear definitions of what proponents of the concept mean by 'ecosystem'.\\" * The public can be deceived by the term ecosystem health which may camouflage the ramifications of a policy goal and be employed to pejoratively rank policy choices. \\"The most pervasive misuse of ecosystem health and similar normative notions is insertion of personal values under the guise of 'scientific' impartiality.\\" Alternatives have been proposed for the term ecosystem health, including more neutral language such as ecosystem status,Link, Jason S. (2002) \\"What Does Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management Mean?\\" Fisheries 27:18-21 ecosystem prognosis, and ecosystem sustainability.Schrecker, Ted (1995) Synthesis of Discussion.pp 118-125 in Hodge, Tony et al. Pathways to Sustainability: Assessing Our Progress. Ottawa: National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy. Another alternative to the use of a health metaphor is to \\"express exactly and clearly the public policy and the management objective\\", to employ habitat descriptors and real properties of ecosystems. An example of a policy statement is \\"The maintenance of viable natural populations of wildlife and ecological functions always takes precedence over any human use of wildlife.\\"Anon (1995). Wildlife policy for Prince Edward Island. Government of Prince Edward Island, 18 pages. An example of a goal is \\"Maintain viable populations of all native species in situ.\\" An example of a management objective is \\"Maintain self-sustaining populations of lake whitefish within the range of abundance observed during 1990-99.\\" Kurt Jax presented an ecosystem assessment format that avoids imposing a preconceived notion of normality, that avoids the muddling of normative and descriptive, and that gives serious attention to ecosystem definition. (1) Societal purposes for the ecosystem are negotiated by stakeholders, (2) a functioning ecosystem is defined with emphasis on phenomena relevant to stakeholder goals, (3) benchmark reference conditions and permissible variation of the system are established, (4) measurement variables are chosen for use as indicators, and (5) the time scale and spatial scale of assessment are decided.

At its launch, the Paragon was the most expensive domestic loudspeaker on the market. Designed by Arnold Wolf from a concept elaborated by Richard Ranger, it is almost long and requires over a hundred-man hours of hand-finishing by a team of dedicated craftsmen. Resembling less a conventional loudspeaker than an elegant sideboard, it is a landmark product for the company that was sought after by the well-heeled and celebrities. With an estimated total production of about 1,000 units, it is highly sought after by collectors to this day.  History  The Paragon is a horn-loaded, stereo speaker system within a single housing. It is based on a diffusion principle developed by Richard Ranger as consultant to JBL. Launched in 1957, the Paragon is the world's earliest production stereo loudspeaker for home use, and also the most expensive speaker at the time. As the flagship JBL product, it cost $1,830 (£650) - equivalent to more than $15,000 in 2013 terms. The \\"Paragon\\" is the product with the longest production run of all JBL loudspeakers. It was produced continually until it was discontinued in 1983, when it was replaced by a product line named \\"Everest\\". = Design = horizontal cross section of a Paragon unit, with labels showing the individual components Since even the early days of stereophonic sound, designers were faced with the issue of directionality and the listener who was not located exactly in between the two speaker units. Col. Richard R. Ranger, a pioneer of stereophonic sound in the film industry, conceptualised the solution to the problem of reproducing stereo sound for all and not just the centrally-positioned listener. He devised a loudspeaker system where the sound from the speaker drive units would be reflected against curved surfaces (wood panels) within a cabinet to create a wide, uniform stereo image that would hold stable in any location within the listening room. Ranger elaborates on the JBL-Ranger Radial Refraction system of stereophonic reproduction thus: Ranger's 9-foot prototype of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become president and chief executive of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design. = Construction = As can be seen from the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very complicated to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor. After overcoming the manufacturing challenges posed by the curved refractor panels and the cabinet legs, the speaker entered production in late 1957. The original 2-way design consisted of two 150-4C bass drivers with 4-inch coils, and two H5038P-100 elliptical horns. The 5038s are essentially midrange drivers that start rolling off at 15 kHz. In 1960, after feedback from foreign distributors, the Paragon was made into a 3-way loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring radiators (tweeters) mounted in the back of the cabinet and aimed at the central 'sweet spot'. Bass–mid crossover was at 500 Hz and mid–treble frequencies crossed over at 7 kHz. The Paragon much resembles a sideboard, measures , and weighs according to the product brochure. Standard finishes include korina, birch, mahogany and ebony; premium wood finishes included light and dark walnut, oak, teak, rosewood; a piano lacquer finish would cost extra. A team of six worked on each unit, spending an estimated 112 to 125-man-hours to complete a single unit, most of it spent on finishing of the woodwork. After assembly, eight hours would be needed just for sanding down the entire enclosure. Then, several coats of varnish are applied by hand, allowed to dry, and then smoothed down by further rubbing. = Product revisions = Product brochure from JBLThe components used in the Paragon went through numerous changes over the years. *1957 - Paragon 44000 launched (\\"domestic\\" and \\"industrial\\" variants). *1960 - the 075 tweeter driver added. *Early 60s - the 150-4C bass driver replaced by the LE15A. *Early 60s - SE408S power amplifier launched, and available for integration with Paragon as powered speakers (removed by the 1970s). *1979 - use the new drivers employing ferrite magnets instead of Alnico V – the LE15A bass driver replaced by the ferrite LE15H; the 375 midrange driver replaced with the Alnico 376. *1983 - Paragon discontinued. = Reception = Partick Vercher at L'Audiophile said that the ideal listening position is at least 3 metres away, and 40-50 cm lower than a normal seated position; alternatively the speaker needs to be hoisted up by that amount for a comfortable sound. The sound itself is described as possessing \\"unshakeable dynamics\\" when turned up loud, pacey without any sign of fatiguing distortion, and with an impressive separation of instruments. Sonic Flare describes the sound of the Paragon as possessing well-integrated \\"liquid highs, excellent midrange and bass\\", and proverbially worth dying for. There are rumours that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin acquired three Paragons each – one for each of left, center and right channels – with which they used to monitor their recordings from master tapes. Only about a thousand units were ever produced over its 25-year life. At the height of production, five units left the factory each week. In 2000, units in mint condition would fetch upwards of $20,000 on the second hand market. It has featured in museum exhibitions, namely one held at Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2011–12 entitled \\"California Design, 1930–1965: Living in a Modern Way.\\" = Spin-offs and legacy = In 1960, JBL launched a smaller and less elaborate 3-way sideboard speaker, measuring , named the \\"C45 Metregon\\". Self powered Paragons and Metregons employing the JBL SE-408S stereo amplifier were optional. A miniature version, the C46 Minigon was also available in the early 1960s.

Description Skull of the glyptosaurine Peltosaurus Glyptosaurines are known primarily from their osteoderms, scale-like pieces of bone that are embedded in the skin and cover much of their bodies. The shape and extent of the osteoderms in glyptosaurines are similar to those seen in an unrelated group of lizards called Monstersauria, which includes the living Gila monster and beaded lizard. The osteoderms of glyptosaurines are unusually complex, consisting of four distinct layers of bony tissue. These tissues may have derived from both the dermis (the lower layer of the skin) and the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) during their development in the embryo. The tissue forming the outermost layer of glyptosaurine osteoderms is similar to tooth enamel and has even been given its own name, osteodermine. Glyptosaurines have been split into the subgroups Melanosaurini and Glyptosaurini, although recent phylogenetic analyses show that Melanosaurini in its traditional sense is paraphyletic, representing an evolutionary grade of glytosaurines more basal (\\"primitive\\") than Glyptosaurini.

It has a cubic structure and a density of around 7.2 g/cm3 in its oxidised form. It is one of a class of ceria-doped electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity and lower operating temperatures (<700 °C) than those of yttria-stabilized zirconia, the material most commonly used in SOFCs. Because YSZ requires operating temperatures of 800–1000 °C to achieve maximal ionic conductivity, the associated energy and costs make GDC a more optimal (even \\"irreplaceable\\", according to researchers from the Fraunhofer Society) material for commercially viable SOFCs. Structure and properties Oxygen vacancies are created when gadolinium (a trivalent cation) is introduced into ceria (CeO2, with Ce in the 4+ oxidation state) or on reduction in CO or H2. The high concentration and mobility of the oxide ion vacancies results in a high ionic conductivity in this material. In addition to its high ionic conductivity GDC is an attractive alternative to YSZ as an electrolyte due to low reactivity and good chemical compatibility with many mixed conducting cathode materials.Garche, Jurgen. et al., ed. Encyclopedia of Electrochemical Power Sources. Oxford: Newnes, 2009. Dopant levels of Gd typically range from 10% to 20%. The majority of SOFC researchers and manufacturers still favor the use of YSZ over CGO due to YSZ having superior strength and because GDC will reduce at high temperature when exposed to H2 or CO.

Kirby was born in Goldsboro, North Carolina, the son of a physician who was superintendent of the state mental hospital in Goldsboro. He attended the public schools of Goldsboro, then enrolled in the University of North Carolina, earned his nomination to Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated with a B.A. in 1896. His medical training was at the Long Island College Hospital in New York, and he earned his M.D. in 1899. He worked under Adolph Meyer at the Worcester State Hospital in Massachusetts. In 1902, when Meyer became director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, located on Wards Island, Kirby went with him and was hired at the Manhattan State Hospital. In 1908, Kirby was appointed director of Clinical Psychiatry at the Manhattan State Hospital. During his years with Meyer, Kirby went to Germany and studied with Emil Kraepelin, professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Munich. While at the Manhattan State Hospital, Kirby developed a classification of psychoses which was expanded as a statistical guide for use in the New York State mental hospitals. The American Psychiatric Association adopted Kirby's classification. He also developed staff education courses for use in state mental hospitals. In 1917, the New York State Hospital Commission appointed Kirby as medical inspector, but after four months he left this position to assume the directorship of the New York State Psychiatric Institute when Meyer left. Kirby was an active participant in planning the move of the New York State Psychiatric Institute from Wards Island to the Columbia University Medical Center and he was involved in the construction of the new building. He held the post of director until he retired in 1931. During World War I, Kirby was a Major in the U.S. Army and commanded the hospital established in New York City to care for mentally disabled soldiers. The U.S. Public Health Service appointed him as a consultant. Kirby served as a professor of psychiatry at several medical schools in New York: from 1914 to 1919, he was Adjunct Professor of Mental Diseases at New York University and Bellevue Medical College; from 1917 to 1932, he was professor of psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College; and from 1927 to 1932 he was professor of psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. Kirby played an active role in numerous professional organizations: the New York Neurological Society (president), the American Neurological Association, the American Psychopathological Association, the American Psychiatric Association (president, 1933–34), the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry, the New York Academy of Medicine, and the Board of Directors of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. He served on numerous editorial boards including those of the American Journal of Psychiatry and Psychiatric Quarterly. The University of North Carolina honored him with an L.L.D. in 1929. Kirby died in 1935 while on vacation in New Hampshire.

Her first national campaign, the Women's Room project, aimed to increase the presence of female experts in the media. She opposes the removal of the only woman from British banknotes (other than The Queen), leading to the Bank of England's swift announcement that the image of Jane Austen would appear on the £10 note by 2017. That campaign led to sustained harassment on the social networking website Twitter of Criado Perez and other women; as a result, Twitter announced plans to improve its complaint procedures. Her most recent campaign was for a sculpture of a woman in Parliament Square; the statue of Millicent Fawcett was unveiled in April 2018, as part of the centenary celebrations of the winning of women's suffrage in the United Kingdom. Her 2019 book Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men was a Sunday Times bestseller. Early life and education Born in Brazil, she is the daughter of Carlos Criado Perez, an Argentinian-born businessman and CEO of the Safeway supermarket chain in the UK, and Alison, an English registered nurse who has worked with Medecins Sans Frontieres on a number of humanitarian aid missions. The family lived in several countries during her childhood, including Spain, Portugal and Taiwan, as well as the UK. When Criado Perez was 11, her father moved to the Netherlands and she began to board at Oundle School, a public school. She disliked what she described as a bullying culture there. Criado Perez spent a year at university in London, then abandoned a history course. Having developed a passion for opera during her teens, she wanted to become an opera singer, and various jobs subsidised her singing lessons. Criado Perez worked in digital marketing for some years, then studied for an English Literature A-level. She gained a place to study English Language and Literature at Keble College, Oxford as a mature student, graduating from Oxford University in 2012. Study of language and gender and a book by Deborah Cameron discussing gender's relationship to pronouns, led to Criado Perez becoming a feminist. She was a runner-up in the London Library Student Writing competition in 2012, receiving £1,000 and other prizes. Since then, she worked, in 2012, as an editor for an information and networking portal of the pharmaceutical industry and in 2013 was in the process of completing a master's degree in Gender Studies from the London School of Economics. In a June 2013 profile by journalist Cathy Newman in The Telegraph, Criado Perez commented: \\"the culture we live in is made up of little tiny sexist acts which you can just ignore but when you think of them collectively you start to see a pattern.\\" Campaigns =Female representation in the media= In November 2012, with Catherine Smith, she founded the website Women's Room, whose goal is to collect suggestions for female professionals and to convey to journalists to increase the proportion of women in the media. The immediate reason for this development were two features on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme broadcast on consecutive days in October 2012, on the prevention of teenage pregnancies and breast cancer, in which no female expert was interviewed – the interviewers were also male. As a result, presenter John Humphrys had to ask during the latter item: \\"if you were a woman you would have no hesitation about being screened\\"? One of the interviewees on the item about teenage pregnancies was Anthony Seldon, the headmaster of Wellington College, a public school. Criado Perez wrote that Seldon might be an authority on contemporary British political history, but not on the immediate subject under discussion. She commented on the rather narrow selection of voices, on social lines as well as gender, in such broadcast debates in early November 2012: \\"These voices are shaping the debate, and they therefore wield a huge influence over our currently populist public policy. If public policy is going to be so responsive to the media, let's make the media truly representative of the public.\\" On the Wikipedia controversy in April 2013 concerning the creation of a sub-category for American women novelists, she was reported as saying: \\"It perpetuates the idea that men are the default and don’t need to be marked in any way, whereas women are still seen as the outliers.\\" =Women on banknotes= In another campaign, she criticised the Bank of England’s decision to replace Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on the £5 note, which left no women featured on the reverse of bank notes; the Queen is depicted on the front of bank notes, with historically prominent people on the reverse. Dismissing Churchill as \\"another white man\\", Criado Perez pointed out that the Equality Act 2010 commits public institutions to \\"eliminate discrimination\\", whereas proof the Bank had acted with the required \\"due regard\\" was absent because details of the decision-making process were not made public. Criado Perez met Head of Notes Victoria Cleland and Chief Cashier Chris Salmon at the Bank to discuss it. The campaign, which gained the support of 35,000 petitioners, and financial support for a potential legal challenge led Mark Carney, the newly appointed Governor of the Bank of England, to announce that the image of Jane Austen would appear on a new £10 note, replacing that of Churchill. \\"People have said this was not such a big thing to tackle, but I didn't especially pick on banknotes\\", Criado Perez commented to The Observers Vanessa Thorpe. \\"I just saw the [proposed] new note and thought, 'I am not having this'. And the Bank of England is not a small institution.\\" Jane Austen was not her preferred female historical figure, but Criado Perez still approved of the choice: \\"She spent her time poking fun at the establishment. All her books are about how women are trapped and misrepresented. It is really sad that she was saying that 200 years ago and I am still having to say that today\\". In an article in the London Evening Standard in September 2017, Criado Perez wrote that she would donate her first \\"Austen tenner\\" to her local women's shelter: \\"It feels like the right way to end this chapter of my life\\". Others followed suit, donating their tenners to charities ranging from large ones such as Women's Aid to start-ups such as Bloody Good Period. =Harassment on Social Media= This decision by the Bank of England resulted in numerous threats, including threats of rape and murder, made against Criado Perez and other women on Twitter from the day of the Bank of England's announcement in July 2013. At this point, Criado Perez said that she was receiving about 50 such threats each hour, and found somewhat inadequate the suggestion that she fill in an on-line form for Twitter detailing the behaviour she had experienced. At the height of the abuse, Criado Perez \\"lost half a stone in two days\\" and \\"couldn't eat or sleep\\". She commented later: \\"I don't know if I had a kind of breakdown. I was unable to function, unable to have normal interactions.\\" While she felt it was taking over her life, Twitter at the time was assuming no responsibility for the content of tweets, merely advising users to contact the relevant authorities. Criado Perez said the campaign of abuse, provoked by a small issue, \\"shows it's not about what women are doing, not about feminism. It's that some men don't like women, and don't like women in the public domain.\\" In her view: \\"Men get attacked because they’ve said or done something someone doesn’t like, whereas women get attacked because they’re visible.\\" The Labour MP Stella Creasy, who had been involved with Criado Perez in the bank note campaign, was amongst those who suffered similar criminal harassment. A man and a woman were arrested towards the end of July. An on-line petition calling on Twitter to introduce a button to enable site users to report abuse had gained 110,000 signatures by 2 August. Criado Perez did not participate in the Twitter silence organised by Times journalist Caitlin Moran for 4 August to persuade Twitter to change its policies. \\"Sorry, but I won't be silenced by anyone\\", she said. Although she acknowledged that the boycott was a \\"mark of solidarity\\", she argued the need to \\"shout back\\" at trolls. On 3 August, the social media site's general manager in Britain, Tony Wang, announced a one-click option on all posts enabling users to easily report abusive tweets, and apologised to the women who had received abuse. In September 2013, Criado Perez felt that the Metropolitan Police had not treated her honourably, and reported that they had lost evidence. The following day, the Metropolitan Police said they had not lost evidence in this case. Meanwhile, Criado Perez deleted her Twitter account for a time. On 16 December, it emerged that a woman and a man from Tyne and Wear would appear in court in early January having been charged with the improper use of a communications network. It was announced at this time that two other suspects were not going to be charged, and of a fifth a decision was yet to be made. On 7 January 2014, John Nimmo (25) and Isabella Sorley (23) pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them. Sorley was sentenced to 12 weeks and Nimmo 8 weeks on 24 January. When asked on the BBC's Newsnight programme in early January whether she was surprised that one of the convicted Twitter abusers was female, Criado Perez said that the woman in question had internalised misogyny already rampant in society as a whole. (embedded video) A second man, Peter Nunn, 33, was found guilty of sending threatening tweets to Creasy on 2 September, and was blocked from contacting either woman when he was imprisoned for 18 weeks on 29 September 2014. As a result of her campaign against Twitter policies, columnist Owen Jones in July 2013 described Criado Perez as \\"a brilliant fighter\\". After Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader in September 2015, Criado Perez tweeted: \\"I really thought Corbyn would have the sense to give top [shadow] cabinet jobs to women. You're a white male leader with a white male deputy\\". Corbyn's shadow Chancellor, Foreign and Home Secretaries were also men. In the context of threatening behaviour suffered predominantly by female Labour MPs before and during the 2016 Labour leadership crisis, Criado Perez has written about the subject for The Pool website. = Statue of Millicent Fawcett = On 8 March 2016, International Women's Day, Criado Perez noticed the absence of any statue of a woman in Parliament Square, Westminster. The eleven statues, including Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela, were all commemorating men. She launched a campaign for a statue of a suffragette to be erected in Parliament Square for the centennial anniversary of the Representation of the People Act 1918. \\"If we lived in a fair world, historical, non-royal women would not make up a paltry 2,7 per cent of all the statues in the UK\\", she wrote in the New Statesman. \\"But we do not live in a fair world. And I'm realistic about the pace of change\\". Her open letter to the newly elected London Mayor Sadiq Khan, published by The Daily Telegraph the following May, was signed by a number of prominent women. Khan soon indicated his agreement to such a development, but did not at that stage commit to the location she wished, Parliament Square. A petition signed by 74,000 people was presented by Criado Perez in June at an event in the Speaker's House State Rooms hosted by the Fawcett Society, with Millicent Fawcett — not a suffragette but a suffragist — now suggested as the figure to be represented. Criado Perez agreed. In April 2017, Sadiq Khan announced that Gillian Wearing had been commissioned to create a statue of Millicent Fawcett. Prime Minister Theresa May also signalled her approval. Fawcett is the first woman to be featured in a statue in the Square, and Wearing is the first female sculptor to have a statue located there. Announcing the plan for the statue of Fawcett, Khan said: \\"It’s simply not right that nearly a century after women’s suffrage, Parliament Square is still a male-only zone, and I’m thrilled that this is soon to change thanks to Caroline’s inspired campaign\\". The statue was unveiled on 24 April 2018 for the commemoration of the extension of the franchise to women in 1918 - though this extension was at first on unequal terms to men. On the plinth of the statue are the names and pictures of 55 women (and 4 men) who fought for women's right to vote. Honours For her successful activism over depicting women on bank notes, Criado Perez won the human rights campaigner of the year award from the pressure group Liberty in November 2013. In 2013, she was also named one of BBC's 100 Women. Criado Perez was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 Birthday Honours for services to equality and diversity, particularly in the media. In 2019, Criado Perez won the Royal Society Insight Investment Science Books Prize and the Financial Times Business Book of the Year award for Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men. Invisible Women The book received both the Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book Prize and the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award in 2019. It has on the whole been welcomed and positively reviewed in major publications. This book is described by Professor Cordelia Fine and Dr Victor Sojo in the The Lancet as providing, \\"several fascinating case studies—from domains as varied as medicine, occupational health and safety, transport, technology, politics, and disaster relief\\". The reviewer GrrrlScientist, writing in Forbes, calls Invisible Women an \\"intelligent, accessible and witty book\\" pointing out its status as the winner of the Royal Society Insight Investment science book prize for 2019, saying \\"as we the readers explore the subtle and ubiquitous nature of male-biased big data, we couldn’t find a more capable guide.\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2019/10/22/invisible-women- exposing-data-bias-in-a-world-designed-for-men/#79a7ff7a3989 It was an \\"intensively researched book\\" which \\"exposes a male-biased world and successfully argues that the lack of “big data” on women is equivalent to rendering half of the world’s population invisible\\". Carol Tavris reviewed it for Skeptical Inquirer Magazine, stating that the \\"theoretical underpinning of this book is not new; every generation of feminist scholars rediscovers Simone de Beauvoir's 1949 observations that women are the second sex\\", referring to the French philosopher's book. Angela Saini reviewed it in The Guardian, calling it \\"a dossier on gender inequality that demands urgent action.\\" The book makes clear, she writes that \\"women aren’t a minority. They are the majority. They are absolutely everywhere and always have been. Yet as Criado Perez shows, women must live in a society built around men. From a lack of streetlights to allow us to feel safe, to an absence of workplace childcare facilities, almost everything seems to have been designed for the average white working man and the average stay-at-home white woman. Her answer is to think again, to collect more data, study that data, and ask women what they want.\\" Still, writes Saini, for all the data that Criado Perez presents, it is unclear that governments (and, perhaps, men, though she does not say this) \\"What should worry us more than the data gap, then, is that huge and seemingly intractable don’t-give-a-damn gap.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/11/invisible-women-exposing- data-bias-by-caroline-criado-perez-review In a review for the Literary Review titled 'Female Unfriendly', the veteran feminist author Joan Smith, herself author of many books including Misogynies: Reflections on Myths and Malice (1989) and Home Grown: How Domestic Violence Turns Men Into Terrorists (2019), lauds the book as essential reading, at least for those to whom Criado Perez's findings will be news. \\"This book, which demonstrates the bias men enjoy in both familiar (to me at least) and less obvious scenarios, sets the record straight. I knew, for instance, that women fare worse after heart attacks because they present with different symptoms from men; Criado Perez cites research showing that women are 50 per cent more likely to be misdiagnosed because they tend not to have the classic ‘Hollywood heart attack’, which begins with chest and left-arm pains. But I didn’t realise that women are also more likely to suffer serious injuries in a car crash because crash test dummies have traditionally been designed to reflect the ‘average’ male body.\\" Smith concludes that \\"The cumulative effect of all this evidence is devastating, even if it confirms what most women already know.\\"https://literaryreview.co.uk/female-unfriendly Publications * * References External links  The Women's Room, a database of women- identifying experts available to talk to the media * Criado Perez at New Statesman * Criado Perez at New Statesman * Criado Perez at The Guardian Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Keble College, Oxford Category:Brazilian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:English feminists Category:English women journalists Category:English people of Argentine descent Category:British women activists Category:Brazilian emigrants to the Netherlands Category:Brazilian people of Argentine descent Category:Brazilian people of English descent Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:BBC 100 Women Category:People educated at Oundle School ","title":"Caroline Criado Perez"},{"id":"40160222","text":"Attila Marcel is a 2013 French comedy film written and directed by Sylvain Chomet.

Along with his Fifth Symphony, it was one of his most successful and frequently performed works during his lifetime and it earned him a reputation as a symphonist. An American critic named it \\"the best symphony of modern times\\" while Hans von Bülow described the symphony's success as \\"colossal\\". It was published in 1871 by Kistner of Leipzig. A typical performance lasts for about 45 minutes. As a Romantic, Raff was deeply inspired by nature. As such, six of his nine programme symphonies are related to nature. Instrumentation The symphony is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B-flat, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, timpani, triangle and strings. Structure The symphony is structured in three parts and four movements: * Part I ** I. Impressions and Feelings: Allegro * Part II ** II. Dreaming: Largo ** III. Dance of the Dryads: Allegro assai * Part III ** At Night. Stillness of the night in the forest. Entry and departure of the wild hunt, with Lady Holle and Wotan. Day-break: Allegro Reception The symphony was enthusiastically received by the audience at that time, spread quickly to England and America and was one of the most played orchestral pieces in the world at the end of the 19th century, which it probably owed to its dramatic musical pictorialism. At the premiere on Easter Sunday, April 17, 1870 in Weimar, a \\"whirlwind of enthusiasm went through the concert hall\\" and Raff was \\"celebrated with frenetic cheers\\" by the audience. Hans von Bülow described the success of the Third Symphony as \\"colossal\\", and an American music critic even called Im Walde \\"the best symphony of modern times; one of the few who are worth to go into posterity accompanied by the works of Beethoven and Schumann.\\" It turned out differently and she fell into oblivion together with Raff, but influenced many later composers in their descriptions of nature. In recent years, the symphony enjoys some popularity again, measured by increasing sales and new recordings.

The Datil Mountains are a small range on the northern edge of the Mogollon-Datil volcanic field, just northwest of the Plains of San Agustin in the U.S. state of New Mexico. The range lies in Socorro and Catron Counties, north of the town of Datil, New Mexico and takes its name from the Spanish word for “date,” dating back over two hundred years. In The Place Names of New Mexico, Robert Julyan suggests two possible explanations for the name: 1) that “the seedpods of the broad-leafed yucca sufficiently resembled dates” or 2) “the Spanish applied the name to the fruit of the prickly pear cactus.” The area includes the major ridgeline of Madre Mountain (elev. 9,556 feet), which is sacred ground to the Acoma, Laguna, and Zuni tribes, as well as several other unnamed peaks and ridges. The majority of the Datil Mountains are part of the Magdalena Ranger District of the Cibola National Forest. There are two Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) within the Datil Mountains: the Datil (13,974 acres) and Madre Mountain (19,855 acres) IRAs. The landscape is expansive and natural with steep-sided hills cloaked with dense conifer forest. The jagged Sawtooth Mountains can be seen to the west. Ecology The Datils contain scrubland, pinyon-juniper woodland, ponderosa pine forest, deciduous oak and grassland areas. At lower elevations, grasses include black and sideoats grama, poverty three-awn, burrograss, and galleta grass. Higher up, grass species include blue and hairy grama, and little bluestem. Shrubs include sotol, cholla, yucca, Apache plume, mountain mahogany, shrub live oak, gambel oak, and alligator juniper. Wildlife includes elk, mule deer, Merriam's turkey, black bears, bobcats, coyotes, foxes, bald and golden eagles, prairie falcon, kestrel, hawks, and owls as well as Gambel's, scaled, and Mearn's quail. The range contains important breeding ground for mountain lion and the southern portion is important for mountain lion connectivity. The Nature Conservancy identified the Datils as a key conservation area in New Mexico due to the range's ecological diversity and species richness. Recreation The Datil Mountains provide outstanding opportunities for hiking, camping, backpacking, hunting, rock climbing, horseback riding and other forms of primitive dispersed recreation given the natural and rugged character, high quality habitat, remarkable views, and size. Thompson Canyon features the challenging Enchanted Tower, and is a popular destination for rock climbers.

Plot Carlos (Antonio de la Torre) is a soft-spoken tailor that hides a secret double life as a serial killer. He stalks his prey carefully and carts them off to a remote mountain cabin where he slices them up and takes a bit of their meat home with him to devour later at his convenience. Carlos otherwise lives his life uneventfully until his path crosses with the beautiful Alexandra (Olimpia Melinte), who tries to spark off a relationship with him. Shortly thereafter, Alexandra goes missing and Carlos is contacted by Alexandra's twin sister Nina (also played by Melinte), who believes that Alexandra ran off after stealing money from their parents. Carlos offers to help Nina to a degree that makes her instantly suspicious, but she decides to stay with him because Alexandra's brutish boyfriend is causing trouble. As the film progresses, Carlos finds himself becoming drawn to Nina and eventually he offers to take her to his remote cabin. He decides that he will drug and murder her, but finds himself incapable of performing the task. Carlos tries to confess that he's murdered not only Nina's sister, but also multiple other women and was going to murder Nina as well, but she refuses to believe him.

On 19 October of the same year he was appointed keeper of the havens of Limekilns and North Queensferry. After the surrender of Mary Queen of Scots at Carberry Hill on 15 June 1567, he was chosen a lord of the articles; and on 29 July he was present at the coronation of the young king James VI of Scotland, in the kirk of Stirling. On 2 June 1568 he was appointed an extraordinary lord of session; and in September of the same year was chosen one of the principal commissioners to accompany the Regent Moray to the conference with the English commissioners at York on the charges against Queen Mary. He was present in the same capacity at Westminster and Hampton Court. At the Perth convention, in July 1569, Pitcairn voted against the queen's divorce from James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell; and in September he was sent to London to acquaint Elizabeth I of England with the various negotiations connected with Mary's proposed marriage to Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Some time after the assassination of the Regent Moray he was, in May 1570, again sent ambassador to Elizabeth, to ask for help in repressing of the internal Scottish troubles, but with little success. On Pitcairn's return to Scotland Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox was made regent: this choice caused William Maitland of Lethington finally to sever himself from the king's party, and Pitcairn was chosen to succeed him as Secretary of State. In November 1570 he was again sent on an embassy to England; and he was also chosen to accompany James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton on an embassy, the following February, to oppose proposals that had been made for Mary's restoration to her throne. Along with Morton, he was also sent, in November 1571, to treat with Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon and other English commissioners at Berwick-on-Tweed for an offensive and defensive league with England, the chief purpose being to obtain aid from Elizabeth against the party of Queen Mary in Edinburgh Castle. These negotiations were successful. Pitcairn now had the confidence of Morton, and he was entrusted by him with negotiations with the English ambassador Henry Killigrew, on the proposal for delivering Mary to the Scottish government for her execution. He was also busy on negotiations with the defenders of Edinburgh Castle, and was one of the commissioners for the pacification, with Huntly and the Hamiltons, at Perth in February 1573. On the council Despite his association with Morton, Pitcairn was a party to the conspiracy against him in 1578; and he was one of the new council of twelve chosen after Morton's fall to govern in the name of the king. On 27 June he was chosen as ambassador to Elizabeth to confirm and renew the league between the realms. His audience with Queen Elizabeth on 25 July 1578 was followed by a meeting with the Privy Council of England at Ralph Sadler's house, now Sutton House in Hackney. Then he went to Ware and the next day followed the court to Audley End House, and was lodged at Saffron Walden. He was called to the queen on 28 July, and discussed the properties of the Countess of Lennox in England, the inheritance of James VI.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1574-1581, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 306-313. Along with other leading figures of the realm, he signed the second confession of faith, called the \\"king's confession\\" or \\"negative confession\\", at Edinburgh, 28 January 1581. He was one of a commission appointed on 15 July following to hear the suit of Sir James Balfour. Although an opponent of Morton, Pitcairn's views were of the Protestant party, and he had a major part in setting up the raid of Ruthven on 23 August 1582, thwarting Lennox and Arran. On 11 January 1583 the keepers of the great seal were ordered, to append the great seal to the gift of the abbacy of Dunfermline to Henry Pitcairn, his nephew, reserving the life-rent to the commendator. On 26 April Pitcairn was appointed assessor to the treasurer, William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie. The effect of the Ruthven raid was reversed at St Andrews Castle, on 24 June 1583, against Pitcairn's wishes, but remained at court. Attempts to bolster his position by bribery led to his being sent into ward in Lochleven Castle; but on 23 September he was set at liberty on caution to remain in or near Dunfermline. Death Pitcairn is supposed to have been the author of this inscription on the abbot's house, Dunfermline on the south side of Maygate Street, the tag \\"Sen vord is thrall and thocht is free,/Keep veill thye tonge, I counsel the\\". During the winter of 1583/4 Pitcairn set sail to Flanders. He returned to Scotland in weak health on 12 September 1584, and obtained license to remain in Limekilns, near Dunfermline. He died on 18 October in his 64th year. He was buried in the north aisle of Dunfermline Abbey, where he was commemorated in a Latin epitaph as the \\"hope and pillar of his country\\". After the extrusion of the Master of Gray from the abbacy in 1587, Henry Pitcairn his nephew entered into possession of it.

It is a form/sub-type of trust and is distinguished by the potential magnitude of its effect. The relationship can be analyzed through techniques developed for the analysis of interpersonal ties. The form of the relationship may be explicit (or implicit) and internal (or external) to an institution in both perception and reality. The disposition of the relationship can be qualified as positive, neutral or negative. The strength of the relationship is quantifiable through a relative percentage from 0% (weak) to 100% (strong) and a degree of separation (for example, 1 degree of separation means the trust relationship is direct, see Six degrees of separation). The characteristics of the relationship may change over variable periods of time (from instantaneously to slowly). Institutional trust is often expressed through a value judgment. It has major implications in all fields of study, especially power dynamics, including (but not limited to) forms of power (social and political).

(1955-1956); Teaching Fellow and Resident Tutor, Harvard University (1953-1955) New Criticism The First Modern Comedies (1959), the first of Holland's major publications, is a New Critical study of the three major writers of Restoration comedy.Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1959. This publication was followed by The Shakespearean Imagination (1964),New York: Macmillan, 1964. a guide to reading Shakespeare's works and Holland's New Critical analyses of thirteen major plays of Shakespeare. The book derived from a Shakespeare program on WGBH_TV that Holland gave as part of the extension program at Harvard. Psychoanalytic criticism Holland's publications on psychoanalytic criticism include Psychoanalysis and Shakespeare (1966),New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966. which summarizes what psychoanalysis had had to say about Shakespeare up to that time and proposes that the roles of readers and audiences are more important to literary criticism than previously understood. The themes introduced in Psychoanalysis and Shakespeare led to his 1968 book, The Dynamics of Literary Response,New York: Oxford University Press, 1968. which provides a model of literary response in which the reader introjects a process of psychological transformation (from unconscious fantasy toward conscious significance) that is embodied in the literary work. Other texts edited or written by Holland on the subject of psychoanalytic criticism include: Shakespeare's Personality (1989; with Bernard J. Paris and Sidney Homan)Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989. and Holland's Guide to Psychoanalytic Psychology and Literature-and-Psychology (1990).New York: Oxford University Press, 1990. Reader-response theory Poems in Persons: An Introduction to the Psychoanalysis of Literature (1973; rev. ed. 2000)New York: Norton, 1973. Cybereditions, 2000. www.cybereditions.com proposes a very different model of literary processing based on a psychoanalytic theory of identity. The central argument of the text is that writers create texts as expressions of their personal identities and readers re-create their own identities when they respond. These identities can be understood as a central theme or themes and behavioral variations on them, much like a theme-and-variations in music. 5 Readers Reading (1975)New Haven: Yale University Press, 1975. The book was reissued under the same title by Transaction in 2011. pursues this conclusion based on case studies of five university students who gave free association responses (according to psychoanalytic technique) to three short stories. They showed that their literary experiences were shaped by readers' identities, and not by the texts they read. Laughing: A Psychology of Humor (1982)Ithaca NY: Cornell University Press, 1982 surveyed theories of laughter. But the book extended the reader-response argument to show, based on a case study of one woman, how what one finds funny, that is, one's sense of humor, expresses one's personal identity. The Delphi Seminar During the 1970s, Holland and his colleague at the State University of New York at Buffalo, Murray Schwartz, developed a style of reader-response teaching that they named the \\"Delphi Seminar.\\"Holland, Norman N. and Murray Schwartz. \\"The Delphi Seminar.\\" College English 36.7 (Mar., 1975): 789-800. The original seminar included students and instructors practicing free association responses to poems and stories and subsequent readings of other participants’ free associations as primary texts. In 1995, Holland published a mystery novel based on the Delphi seminars entitled Death in a Delphi Seminar: A Postmodern Mystery.Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1995. The story takes place in an English department, and the reader is led through the text using reader-response theory to understand the characters and the crime. Know Thyself: Delphi Seminars (2009)Gainesville, FL: PsyArt Foundation, 2008. by Holland and Schwartz provides an overview of the Delphi Seminar teaching style and lays out the seminar's findings. Literature and cognitive science The I (1985)New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985. Reissued by Transaction, 2011 extends the holistic method employed by Holland in his previously published case studies of readers. In the text, Holland proposes general processes of perception and symbolization that are applicable throughout life. The text elaborates a \\"model of mind\\" based on psychological concepts of feedback, and illustrates how individuals both use, and are constrained by, their bodies, their culture, and their \\"interpretive communities\\" as well as their personalities or identities. Using conclusions set forth by psychoanalytic theory, The I combines Holland's theory of the role of identity in people's perceptions and behavior, and the psychoanalytic stages of childhood and adult development. In The Brain of Robert Frost: A Cognitive Approach to Literature (1988),New York: Routledge, 1988. Holland draws on neurological evidence of a \\"growing and ungrowing\\" of the brain in mammalian development to show how an identity theme might come into being in the body. Additionally, this text develops a three-tier feedback model of the mind, which illustrates that the brain deals with its world by hypothesizing through physiology, through fixed codes and flexible canons derived from culture, and through personal identity. The Critical I (1992)New York: Columbia University Press, 1992. further develops the model set forth in The Brain of Robert Frost and includes a critical attack on the postmodern idea of the disappearance of the self. Television appearances Holland was The Film Critic weekly from 1957 to 1959 on WGBH-TV in Boston,and he presented for Harvard's Lowell Institute a weekly 30-minute program, The Shakespearean Imagination in 1963 also on WGBH- TV. Later work Holland's later work consisted of understanding literary processes through neuropsychology and the developing field of neuro- psychoanalysis. Literature and the Brain (2009)Gainesville, FL: PsyArt Foundation, 2009. is partly based on a seminar Holland created and taught in 2004 and later years entitled \\"The Brain and the Book\\". Literature and the Brain explores the human experience of literature, explicating the processes by which the brain experiences the \\"willing suspension of disbelief,\\" emotional response to characters, plot, form, and literary language, culminating in, perhaps, pleasure and evaluation. The book addresses the reading or viewing of poems, stories, plays, and films and the evolutionary basis for literature. Holland's Meeting Movies (2006)Madison, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2006. extends reader-response criticism to eight classic films. Another of Holland's projects, A Sharper Focus, is an online film resource featuring a collection of essays meant to inform and enhance the viewer experience of classic movies. Personal life Holland was born in New York City to Norman N. Holland, a patent lawyer, and Harriette Holland, also a lawyer. In 1954 he married Jane Kelley (deceased 2015). At the end of his life he resided in Gainesville, Florida. He is survived by two children and four grandchildren.

He later got his MA and PhD (1997) at the CentER for Economic Research at Tilburg University in Tilburg, the Netherlands. Gneezy, who frequently contributes to the Freakonomics website,http://freakonomics.com/tag/uri-gneezy/ is known for designing simple, clever experiments to demonstrate behavioral phenomena that open up new research directions in behavioral economics. Examples include his work on when and how incentives work, deception, gender differences in competitiveness, and behavioral pricing. Gneezy and coauthor John A. List have published a book on the hidden motives and undiscovered economics of everyday life, titled \\"The Why Axis.\\" In 2014, Gneezy cofounded Gneezy Consulting, a business consultation company that specializes in behavioral economics. Before joining the Rady School, Gneezy was a faculty member at the University of Chicago, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and Haifa University. He was a visiting professor at the University of Amsterdam Center for Research in Experimental Economics and Political Decision Making (CREED).  Research  Since receiving his Ph.D. from Tilburg University in 1997, Gneezy has started a few lines of research that have become part of the agenda in behavioral economics. Examples include papers on gender differences, discrimination, deception, the uncertainty effect, and the counter-productivity of incentives. In his research, he typically starts with new and original questions the literature has not yet investigated, and addresses them with simple empirical demonstrations of powerful psychological effects. Rather than testing theories, Gneezy begins with the demonstration of behavioral effect. Personal life  Gneezy currently resides in San Diego, California, with his wife and three children.

The Rally North America events have raised over $1,000,000 for charity since its inception in 2009 RNA (Rally North America) was established in 2009 by a group of fans that couldn't attend a different automotive rally. RNA (aka Rally North America) is a group of around 80 or more road rally teams that gather together at least once a year to raise money for a selected charity. Each year the group picks another charity to support, while enjoying each other's company on America's vast road system. Along the way the group finds spots or Check points and takes pictures of themselves in front of whatever the check-point as proof they had stopped at that location. Awards are given to the teams that best complete or meet the qualifications of the award. The Goal of any Rally North America event is to raise money for a deserving charity. All money raised by the rally teams goes to that years charity nothing is ever kept by the teams. The event has grown to a level that new teams can only join the RNA if a slot opens up, many of the teams return year after year to help raise money and enjoy the trips.

The government is unitary, representative and organized according to the principle of separation of powers is vested in a unitary state. Structure =Central Government= It is formed by the executive, legislative, judicial branches and autonomous constitutional agencies. Executive Branch The Executive Branch is responsible for executing the government, enforcing laws and policies that the State promotes. It's formed by the office of the President of Peru, the Cabinet of Peru and the executive branch agencies. The President of the Republic, who is both head of state and head of government, personifies the nation, the office of the President and Vice Presidents throughout the country. The Cabinet of Peru, is composed by Ministers of State and chaired by the Prime Minister of Peru. =Ministries= * Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation * Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism * Ministry of Defense * Ministry of Economy and Finance * Ministry of Education * Ministry of Energy and Mines * Ministry of the Interior * Ministry of Justice and Human Rights * Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations * Ministry of Production * Ministry of Foreign Relations * Ministry of Health * Ministry of Labor and Promotion of Employment * Ministry of Transportation and Communications * Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation * Ministry of Environment * Ministry of Culture * Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion Legislative Branch The Legislative Branch is vested in the Congress of the Republic of Peru, consisting of a single chamber of 130 members elected by direct suffrage and multiple district in proportion to the population of each region (Lima Region has 32 congressmen, Madre de Dios Region have one). The Congress is renewed every five years. The start and end dates of a constitutional term are the same that apply to the presidential constitutional term. Judicial Branch The judicial function is performed by the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court of Peru, which has jurisdiction over the entire territory. It is the body responsible for administering justice. The second hierarchical level is formed by the Superior Courts with jurisdiction over an entire Judicial District. The third level is formed by the Courts of First Instance whose competence is about provincial. Finally, the Justices of the Peace, with district competition. Autonomous Constitutional Agencies The Constitution, to safeguard the rule of law and greater efficiency in the execution of some tasks, has created some autonomous agencies, which do not depend on any of the branches of government: * National Elections Jury * National Office of Electoral Processes * National Registry of Identification and Civil Status * Constitutional Tribunal of Peru * Public Ministry * National Council of the Magistrature * Central Reserve Bank of Peru * Comptroller General of the Republic of Peru * Public Defender * Superintendency of Banking and Insurance of Peru =Regional Governments= The regional level, as stated in the constitution, corresponds to the regions and departments. Currently, the country has no regions and each department is expected to join some (I) other (s) to form regions. The administration of each region is managed by a body called the Regional Government, consisting of a regional council, a presidency regional and regional Coordinating Council. Although there is currently no region RBCs have settled at the departmental level to lead the process of regionalization. Peru is a highly centralized country. Thus, in 2003 the central government concentrated 86% of revenue compared to 65% of the countries in the region and 54% in developed countries, public spending of subnational governments was 12% compared to total expenditure, while in the countries of Latin America is 35%, and in most developed countries is 43%. Lima accounts for about 86% of tax revenues. PAGE 24: http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=917346 decentralization Early efforts began in 1985, when 12 regions were created: the process was not successful due to the conflicts in the political influence and the distribution of the budget, transfer of skills disorganized, inconsistency with the tax system, and the system of choice it was for regional assemblies. In 1992 suspended the process and replaced by decentralized administration of the central government called CTAR-Transitory Councils of Regional Administration, in every department, and was accentuated centralism. In 2001, the decentralization process is revitalized with a broad consensus. The organizing principles of the law are: you create regional governments based on historical departments, providing incentives for voluntary merger, clearly defined responsibilities, there is a neutrality and fiscal responsibility is gradually transferred services, no transparency in the process. =Local Governments= The local level, as stated in the constitution, are the provinces, districts and towns. These districts are administered by municipalities, consisting of a Mayor and City Council, which in turn directs the municipal companies.

Biography Officially, Mykola Stasyuk was born into a family of serviceman from Yekaterinoslav Governorate. Mykola Chaban, however, found some information about a student Nikolai Mikhailovich Stasyukov at the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, which is very similar with biography of the Ukrainian minister Mykola Stasyuk. According to Chaban, Stasyukov was born on May 16, 1885 in Yekaterinoslav. His father nobleman Mikhail Stefanovich Stasyukov was a veterinary doctor. His mother was called Yekaterina Naumovna Konoplia. Both of them were eastern Orthodox Christians. The boy was baptized on May 23, 1885 at Holy Trinity ChurchKavun, M.

It specializes in making clones of the Hammond organ and became popular when jazz organists \\"Papa\\" John and Joey DeFrancesco \\"defected\\" from Hammond to using their organs instead. History The company was formed by former Hammond- Suzuki Northeast Regional Sales Rep and Marketing Services Manager, Tom Tuson, who had been impressed by a drawbar MIDI module manufactured by Voce, which used physical modelling instead of samples. He became friends with Voce's Dave Amels, and the two decided to collaborate on a project to create their own organ. They came up with the Diversi DV, which earned immediate critical acclaim for its accuracy. In an interview with Keyboard magazine, Don Bosco said the DV \\"feels to me exactly how a vintage Hammond would have when it was new.\\" The company received a major boost when Joey DeFrancesco, self-described as \\"the finest jazz organist on the planet\\", publicly announced he had \\"defected from Hammond\\" and was now actively endorsing Diversi and owning a stake in the business. His 2008 album Joey D! was recorded entirely on a Diversi, with sleeve note author Michael G Nastos declaring that \\"the instrument DeFrancesco plays acts and sounds like an organ, if possible with a richer, deeper tone, especially in the bass foot pedals.” His father, Papa John DeFrancesco also used the Diversi to record Big Shot. Tom Tuson has made a specific point in interviews, that Diversi could offer a more affordable drawbar organ with a better sound engine alternative than Hammond Suzuki's \\"New B3,\\" while being at a lower price and including a built-in Leslie speaker simulator. Though he once, like many organists, thought the Hammond and Leslie were inseparable, he now thinks the simulation on the Diversi is so good that \\"I don't care if I ever see another Leslie in my life\\".

The book was first published on April 23, 2013 through Balzer + Bray and is the first book in the House of Secrets series. The book follows the three Walker family children as they attempt to find a secret book and rescue their parents in the process. Rights to the book were sold in 12 foreign territories. Of the book, Columbus has commented that he was inspired to write the series after seeing the popularity of the Harry Potter series and its effect on young readers. Columbus has also remarked that he views the book as a \\"cousin\\" to his 1985 film The Goonies. Synopsis Cordelia, Brendan, and Eleanor Walker are less than pleased when their parents purchase the old and creepy, suspiciously inexpensive yet too-perfect Kristoff House; even less when, after just a few days of living in the house, a mysterious woman called Dahlia Kristoff appears and demolishes it. She claims to be the \\"Wind Witch\\" and the daughter of the original owner of the house, Denver Kristoff. The three Walker children are horrified when they find that suddenly, they weren't in San Francisco anymore, and their parents were nowhere to be found. Cordelia is mystified when they meet Will Draper, a member of the Royal Flying Corps from World War I, who seems quite familiar. This is when the Walker kids realize that they're trapped in a novel written by Kristoff himself, a novel from which their new friend Will came. They soon find strange things and learn that they are not just trapped in a single book, but inside three of them. The Wind Witch appears before them once again, demanding that they find The Book of Doom and Desire, a secret book that she can't touch, should the kids ever want to see their parents again. The problem is, the three kids are trapped in this vast universe of intertwined stories and they have no clues as to where the book is. They go on crazy adventures and jump over extreme hurdles like deaths and danger, meeting all sorts of friends as well as foes, all to find this Book of Doom and Desire.  Characters  * Jake Walker used to be a working professional doctor in San Francisco before \\"the incident\\". * Bellamy Walker Wife of Dr. Jacob Walker. * Cordelia: oldest Daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Walker. (15 years old) who falls for Will Draper * Brendan: Son of Mr. and Mrs. Walker. (12 years old) * Eleanor: Youngest Daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Walker. (8 years old) * Denver Kristoff:Used to own the Kristoff House, the Storm King, and writer of The Heart And The Helm, Savage Warriors, and The Fighting Ace * Dahlia Kristoff: Daughter of Mr. Kristoff, the Wind Witch and Queen Daphne * Will Draper: A National Flying Corp airman in World War One who helps the Walker children. * Slayne: A courtier in the court of Queen Daphne.

She was brought back to life by Brendan in the Kristoff house attic and was killed by Denver Kristoff because she found The Book Of Doom And Desire * Celene: Resistance fighter who Brendan has a crush on Development Columbus originally began working on the House of Secrets in 1999 as a screenplay entitled Stones of Time, but chose to adapt it into a novel after realizing that the film would be too expensive to produce at that time and also because of his obligations for the Harry Potter film series. Due to his inexperience with writing novels, Columbus brought in Vizzini to assist in the writing of the novel. Columbus and Vizzini wrote the book by the two e-mailing the first few chapters back and forth until they had \\"about 100 pages\\". They sent the completed portion of the book to publishers and were picked up within about 1–2 days. After completing the manuscript, Columbus and Vizzini solicited the advice of J.K. Rowling, who recommended that they add more character development to the novel as it \\"[moved] too fast\\". The two authors based the character of Denver Kristoff on writers such as Ray Bradbury and H.P. Lovecraft, and designed the book's chapters to end on cliffhangers akin to \\"the work of someone like Michael Crichton or even Charles Dickens\\". Film Film rights to the House of Secrets trilogy have been picked up by Rise Entertainment. Columbus's 1492 Pictures was going to adapt the series from Columbus' initial screenplay with principal photography slated to begin in January 2014. This never happened. Reception Critical reception has been mostly positive. Publishers Weekly and Commonsensemedia both gave favorable reviews for House of Secrets, with Publishers Weekly commenting that while the \\"kitchen sink aspect of the plot gives the story a somewhat crowded, frenetic feel\\", the \\"deft characterizations and wildly imaginative concept more than make up for it\\". Kirkus Reviews gave a mixed review, remarking that the book had \\"plenty of punch\\" but that it \\"may still have trouble measuring up to the competition\\".

She was born to a Polish-speaking family in Burshtyn (Galicia, now Ukraine). During World War I her family fled to Vienna and moved later to Lviv (formerly known as Lemberg), where Vogel spent most of her life. She studied Philosophy and Psychology at the Jan Kazimierz University (now Ivan Franko National University of Lviv). Early career Vogel graduated from the Lwów Jewish gymnasium. During her time there, she was active in the Zionist youth movement. She later studied philosophy in Vienna and Polish literature in Cracow. In 1926 she obtained her Ph.D. For her doctoral dissertation she chose to examine the influence of Hegel’s aesthetics upon Józef Kremer. After completing her education, Vogel taught psychology at a college in Lwów. Vogel began writing poetry while at the university. She initially wrote German poetry, but switched to Yiddish literature. She excelled at writing in Yiddish although it was not spoken at her home. She moved about in Yiddish literary circles and contributed articles for several Yiddish journals. Two of these were the Polish journals Sygnały and Wiadmosci Literackie. She was also a contributor to Tsushtayer, the short-lived Lwów Yiddish journal of literature and art. She published essays, art reviews, and her own poems and essays on poetry in the journal. She became a correspondent and close friend of writer and painter Bruno Schulz, from Drohobych. Poetry Vogel's poetic legacy is marked for its experimental spirit. Her poems, mostly written in the 1930s, reflect the radical and minimalistic outlook that all art aspired toward during this period in history. Her experiment in poetry was mostly about fusing poetry and art. She called this technique 'white words,' and described it as an attempt to \\"create a new lyric poetry of the urban condition.\\" This style was, however, not liked by critics both during her lifetime and later, who considered it too intellectual, obscure and devoid of feminist themes. Vogel responded to such claims by stating that her style was not deliberate, but an outcome necessitated by life's experiences. World War I World War I forced Vogel's family to flee to Vienna. From there they moved to Lwów, where Vogel would spend the majority of her life. Marriage In 1932 Vogel married Barenblit, a Lwów architect and engineer. In 1937, their only son, Anshel, was born. Death Together with her husband and son, she was killed in the Lwów ghetto in 1942. Works Vogel was a prolific poet and essayist. Her most famous poems are ″You are Light and Bowing,″ (1929), ″Day-Figures″ (1930), ″Mannequins″ (1934), ″Legend of Silver″ (1935). She also wrote some prose. These include Acacias Bloom (1935), Fragments of a Montage-Novel (1936), and Military Parade (1938). Vogel's essays include; Theme and Form in the Art of Chagall (1929), ′White Words′ in Poetry (1931), Stasis, Dynamics and Contemporaneity in Art (1936) and The Literary Genre of Montage (1937).

The alpha and beta chains of the TCR (red) are linked through a disulphide bond (blue bar) introduced artificially between the TCR constant domains. The TCR variable and constant domains are as indicated. The anti-CD3 scFv effector function is fused to the TCR beta chain. ImmTACs (Immune mobilising monoclonal T-cell receptors Against Cancer) are a class of bispecific biological drug being investigated for the treatment of cancer and viral infections which combines engineered cancer-recognizing TCRs with immune activating complexes. ImmTACs target cancerous or virally infected cells through binding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presented peptide antigens and redirect the host's cytotoxic T cells to recognise and kill them. ImmTACs are fusion proteins that combine an engineered T Cell Receptor (TCR) based targeting system with a single chain antibody fragment (scFv) effector function. TCRs, like antibodies, constitute an important antigen recognition system within the immune system; but, whereas antibodies are restricted to targeting cell surface or secreted proteins TCRs can recognise peptides derived from intracellular targets presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Naturally occurring TCRs are low affinity (0.18-387 micromolar range) 2-chain membrane receptors expressed on the surface of T cells. To produce stable, soluble, high affinity TCRs capable of being used as diagnostics and therapeutics the two TCR protein chains are stabilised through the introduction of a novel disulphide bond between the 2 constant domains and the affinity increased 1-5 million fold to low picomolar values through phage display affinity maturation. To provide the soluble, affinity enhanced TCR with a biological effector function the beta chain of the TCR is fused to an scFv antibody fragment specific for the CD3 T cell co-receptor, creating an ImmTAC. The molecular weight of an ImmTAC molecule is ~75kDa. Mechanism of action A schematic representation of the mechanism of action for ImmTACs ImmTACs exert their activity through T cell redirection, a mechanism of action used by several other bi-specific biologics such as the Bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs). After administration of the drug the picomolar affinity TCR portion of the ImmTAC binds to the cancerous or virally infected cell through specific recognition of target HLA-peptide complexes on their cell surface. This picomolar affinity binding results in the diseased cells becoming coated in CD3 co-receptor specific scFv antibody fragments that constitute the ImmTAC effector function. Any Cytotoxic T cell that subsequently comes into direct physical contact with the ImmTAC coated diseased cell is redirected to kill it, regardless of the specificity of its native TCR. This redirected killing does not require binding of any co-stimulatory molecules and is effected through the targeted release of perforin and granzyme from the redirected T cell that induces the targeted disease cell to die through an apoptosis mediated mechanism. However, the danger of activating a wide variety of nonspecific cytotoxic T cell clones via anti-CD3 scFv exists, leading to their proliferation and widespread autoimmunity.

It is a Facebook-based application that allows users to self-select their roommates by researching potential roommates using their Facebook profiles and lifestyle questionnaire responses. By 2013, RoomSync had more than 100,000 users that utilized the application to choose their roommates.  History  RoomSync was founded in August 2007 by Rob Castellucci, Alex Edelsburg, Michael Hacker, and Ariel Himmelstern. The idea for the company came about while Castellucci was working as a leasing consultant at a student housing complex in Gainesville, Florida. During this time, Castellucci received various calls for roommate switches due to students researching their matched roommates and not liking what they saw. It wasn’t until the launch of Facebook Platform in 2007 that RoomSync came to life with their first name of “RoomBug” as an application that could be hosted through Facebook. RoomSync started working with their first client, the University of Florida, in 2009. In July 2010, the company changed its name from RoomBug to what it is known as today, RoomSync. In 2009, RoomSync was named one of the top 50 fbFund finalists. Facebook’s seed fund and mentorship program with Accel Partners and Founders Fund was established to help and enable talented developers and entrepreneurs to build sustainable businesses on Facebook. Features RoomSync enables users to upload personal information to their RoomSync profile using the information that is already on a users Facebook profile plus a questionnaire that lets users share lifestyle habits such as cleanliness levels, studying habits, sleep cycles, and more. In 2012, RoomSync started offering White-label product features to their clients that allows clients to apply their own identity/brand to the Facebook Application but is still fully supported and serviced by RoomSync. RoomSync offers access to its application on both computers or through an Android (operating system) mobile device. Users do not pay for the use of RoomSync since the general client such as a leasing office or university housing office pays this service fee. Controversy  In August 2010, The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote an article titled “Don’t Send In the Clones” where she challenged the self-selection process of roommates that is offered by RoomSync. Dowd argues that “the serendipity of ending up with roommates that you like, despite your differences, or can’t stand, despite your similarities, or grow to like, despite your reservations, is an experience that toughens you up and broadens you out for the rest of life.” One RoomSync client school was concerned about the effect on diversity while using RoomSync for roommate matching. According to research done by the University of Florida, more than 85% of incoming freshmen submitted a roommate request via the UF housing portal with no adverse effect on ethnic diversity.  News  New York Times In August 2010 Lisa W. Foderaro of The New York Times wrote “Roommates Who Click” where she discussed the events of a recent high school grad that found her New York University roommate using online websites such as Uroomsurf.com. Foderaro mentioned the use of RoomBug (now RoomSync) to find roommates and how RoomSync emphasized security.

High-profile feminist and LGBT advocate Ailbhe Smyth served as Chair of the organisation for many years. History Previous logo of the NLGF, until 2014 The organisation was founded as the National Gay Federation (NGF) in 1979. It leased a building in Temple Bar, Dublin and established the Hirschfeld Centre, Ireland's first, full comprehensive LGBT community centre, named after the prominent German doctor and sexologist, Magnus Hirschfeld. The Centre included a meeting space, a café, and a full-automated 16mm cinema, the Hirschfeld Biograph. The Centre held a youth club, film club, and women's group, all funded by Flikkers, the centre's community disco. In 1981, NGF members participated in the first national gay conference organised by the Cork Gay Collective. On 4 November 1987, a fire irrevocably damaged the Hirschfeld Centre. In September 1990, the NGF board voted to amend its name to the National Lesbian and Gay Federation (NLGF). The change was supported by 84% of NGF members. The name change took effect on 1 January 1991. In 2000, the NLGF was incorporated as a not-for- profit limited company by guarantee and achieved charitable status. In February 2014, the NLGF was renamed the National LGBT Federation or NXF for short. A new logo was also unveiled. The announcement was made at an event in Dublin celebrating 35 years of the organisation's existence. Publications =Identity= From 1982 to 1984, the NGF published Identity, Ireland's first gay literary journal. Edited by renowned film-maker, Kieron Hickey, the publication was not profitable and ceased publication in March 1984, after its eighth issue. =Out= From 1984 to 1988, the NGF published Out magazine, Ireland's first commercial lesbian and gay magazine. Unlike Identity, Out magazine was distributed by Eason's. Contributors included Nell McCafferty, Tonie Walsh, Nuala O'Faolain and Thom McGinty. The final issue in October 1988 was delayed as the magazine printers, the Carlow Nationalist and Leinster Times, refused to print the previous issue due to an allegedly offensive Gay Health Action advertisement on safer sex for gay men. =Gay Community News= On 10 February 1988, the NGF published the Gay Community News (GCN), an 8-page tabloid newspaper. Tonie Walsh served as founding editor. In 1997, NLGF and GCN moved from the Hirschfeld Centre to the Outhouse LGBT community centre, located on Wicklow Street in Dublin. When Outhouse moved offices to Capel Street, Dublin 1 in 2001, GCN moved to its own premises on Scarlett Row in Dublin 8. Receipt of Atlantic Philanthropies funding in 2002 allowed NLGF to begin developing GCN as a commercially viable magazine. Irish Queer Archive In 1980, members of the NGF created the Gay Community Archives, an archival collection of material and literature associated with the LGBT community in Ireland and precursor to the Irish Queer Archive. The 1997 move from the Hirschfeld Centre allowed the IQA to open a small public office. In December 1999, the NLGF board appointed an IQA working group, comprising academics, historians and writers.

Most known for his last act of piracy of the brig Crawford. He wore a blue velvet frock coat, carried a cane and was small of stature with fine features and a dark complexion. At the time of his death he had grey hair and wore dentures. Early life Alexander Tardy was the eldest son born in France in 1767 to a wealthy family which fled to Saint- Domingue escaping the French Revolution. He and his family lived on a plantation there until the Haitian Revolution again displaced them. He and his father (or uncle) fled this time to Philadelphia, PA. In Philadelphia, PA by 1797, Tardy had opened a tin shop which he advertised in the local paper, at 51 North 3rd Street.Date: Thursday, May 4, 1797 Philadelphia Gazette (Philadelphia, PA) Volume: XIV Issue: 2656 p. 1 He later moved to Charleston, SC where he advertised as a tinsmith at 131 Queen Street by 1806.Ancestry.com.

Baltimore, MD, USA: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2000 On June 16, 1809 there was a fire in his tin shop, which burnt to the ground along with two adjacent homes on Bay Street. On June 24, 1809 Tardy received $800 of fire insurance funds from the London Phoenix Fire Company, for his house and the kitchen.Date: Thursday, July 13, 1809 Charleston Courier (Charleston, SC) Volume: VII Issue: 2016 p. 1 By November 11, 1809, he had set up shop as a tinsmith in Augusta, GA on Broad Street. In 1812 Tardy's family pressured Captain John Smith of the USS Congress (1799) into taking him on as a captain's steward. Tardy was brought back to shore at Norfolk, VA, after being publicly flogged aboard ship, for stealing the captain's property and selling it to other officers. Tardy was officially dismissed March 8, 1814, at Portsmouth, NH, having fully served the term of his enlistment from the U.S. Navy. He was suspected of poisoning Captain John Smith while on board the USS Congress. Captain Smith died August 6, 1815 in Philadelphia, PA, at the age of 35 from a \\"declining liver\\". In 1814 Tardy impersonated a Frenchman, who had also escaped from San Domingue, and attempted to retrieve the Frenchman's property from a ship's hold. He employed lawyer William Hunter, who discovered Tardy was an impostor and accused Tardy, who then left town in haste. That same year, he moved to Boston where he apprenticed under a dentist, who dismissed him after finding Tardy to be more interested in the application of the various medications, than dentistry. In Boston Tardy was caught stealing Captain George Washington Balch's pocketbook from the Eastern Stage House, managed by Benjamin Hale, at 45 Ann St. (now North St.). He was sentenced to 5 days in solitary confinement, followed by 3 years hard labor in the Charlestown State Prison in Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts. Maria On December 3 after Tardy was released from prison, he boarded the brig Maria, a ship bound for Charleston, SC. He poisoned Captain Latham and 7 others aboard the Maria, secretly putting arsenic in the hash served for breakfast on the morning of the 7th. Tardy, claiming to be a doctor, advised the use of castor oil and abstaining from water to everyone, John Benjamin from North Carolina, was thought to have drunk water and died within 24 hours as a result. Tardy accused the ship's cook John Gibson of the poisoning. John Gibson was tried for and convicted of the crime In Charleston, SC. He was hanged March 4, 1817, still protesting his innocence. Regulator On June 17, 1817, Tardy boarded the Regulator in Boston, MA bound for Philadelphia, PA. He poisoned the sugar used for morning coffee with arsenic, again administering a \\"sweet oil\\" as a remedy. One victim, Godfrey Daniel Lehman, a 35-year-old German citizen (from the French military service) on his way to visit his brother in Philadelphia died. Tardy blamed the cook of the Regulator for poisoning. Captain Presbury Norton's knowledge of the cook and his testimony cleared the cook of suspicion. Tardy claimed that Mr. Lehman had left his possessions to him. The Captain refused to hand over Mr. Lehman's things to Tardy. Tardy spent the night at The Mansion House Hotel on Third Street, then moved to a house at Vine and Water Streets, where he began planning another piracy. Someone he confided to betrayed him, Tardy was arrested and tried for poisoning the crew of a vessel. Due to lack of testimony, Tardy was only convicted of conspiracy to poison the crew of a vessel. He was sentenced to 7 years of hard labor in Walnut Street Prison. He was released July 17, 1824. He booked passage to Savannah aboard the brig Frances, but was put ashore with his luggage when he was recognized. Cora By October of that year, he was in Charleston, SC advertising himself as a dentist. On November 18, 1825, at 9:00 pm Tardy attempted to steal a pilot boat named Cora from the dock in Charleston, with the aid of two of the boat's crew members. The owners of the boat, William, Copes and Delany, ambushed him during the attempt. Tardy fired two pistols at them in an attempt to escape. March 3, 1825 he was convicted of conspiracy to steal a pilot boat and sentenced to 2 years in the Old Charleston Jail. Crawford Following Tardy's release from jail he travelled to Cuba, where on January 24, 1827, Tardy received a signed petition to practice dentistry. There Tardy teamed up with Jose Murando (a.k.a. Courro), Jose Hilario Casares (aka Pepe), and Felix Barbieto, intending to steal a ship and flee to Africa or Europe with its cargo. Tardy met Captain Henry Brightman of Troy, Massachusetts in port. Tardy introduced himself as a doctor to Captain Brightman who then consulted about his asthma. Tardy sent 3 vials of \\"asthma medication\\" to Captain Brightman, before the ship set sail. Tardy's plan was to poison most of those aboard once they were at sea, while keeping those alive that might aid with navigation and translation. Tardy and his co-conspirators boarded the brig Crawford at the port of Mantanzas, Cuba, as two separate parties, Felix with a large trunk he claimed contained $17,000 in gold. The Crawford sailed May 28 with mate Edmund Dobson, Norman Robinson, a North Kingstown RI carpenter named Eldred Holloway, an Irish carpenter, Ferdinand Ginoulhiac, Nathaniel P. Deane, cook Stephen Gibbs, Joseph Doliver, Asa Bicknell, and Oliver Potter. On May 31, Captain Brightman was ill and confined to his berth (probably due to his \\"asthma medicine\\"), the rest of the passengers and crew were ill shortly after eating a breakfast prepared by Tardy.Real Pirates of the Caribbean, No “yo-ho-ho” for this 1827 case, By Harry Kollatz Jr., Issue: December 2009, Posted: 3/25/10 11:04 a.m. The violence began at 1:40 am on June 1. Pepe was in the companion- way, Couro in the forecastle and Felix in midship. Victims Captain Brightman, Mr. Robinson, the American and Irish carpenters were sleeping in the cabin, Ginoulhiac, Dobson, Deane, and Doliver were on deck; and Bicknell, Potter and Gibbs were in the forecastle. Tardy approached Doliver, who was at the helm, asking him about his course. As Doliver bent over to check his course more precisely, Tardy cut him twice quickly across his throat. Doliver, still alive, escaped to the main rigging. Tardy clapped his hands giving the signal to his accomplices who began screaming intended to rouse everyone. The American carpenter was the first to exit the cabin, and was immediately stabbed by Pepe, and following a struggle, Pepe used an axe to split the American's chest. Captain Brightman was next to rush on deck and was felled by Felix with an axe. The Irish carpenter was also axed on his way out of the cabin. Mr. Robinson saw the Irishman meet his fate and decided to jump from the cabin window into the ocean. Meanwhile, Cuorro in the forecastle had stabbed Potter, Gibbs, and Bicknell in succession. Deane was missed in the darkness and escaped overboard into the sea without injury. Dobson who had awoken to the screeching, ran to the forecastle, where he saw Pepe with a knife in his hand prepared to strike, attempting to avoid the blow he was stabbed in the left shoulder. As Dobson approached the main rigging, he saw Potter, who was supporting himself with the railing, hands over his stomach. Potter asked Dobson if there was anything with which they could defend themselves. Dobson grabbed a handspike, which Potter took, and they ascended the main shrouds where Doliver had taken refuge. When they reached the cross- trees, Potter, intestines protruding through his wounded abdomen, fainted. He was prevented from falling, by Dobson and Doliver. At this time, they heard something thrown into the water and assumed that bodies had been thrown overboard. They also heard the voices of Robinson and Deane in the water unsuccessfully asking for something to keep them afloat. Tardy called to Dobson \\"Mr. Dobson, where are you?\\" Dobson replied, \\"In the maintop.\\" Tardy replied \\"Are you wounded?\\" Dobson replied \\"Yes.\\" Tardy asked Dobson to descend, Dobson refused. When Tardy assured Dobson he would be spared, if he would come down, Dobson descended and was immediately surrounded by the Spaniards. Tardy asked the whereabouts of the trunk brought on board by Felix. Dobson said he had put the trunk in the stateroom, but didn't know what had become of it. Tardy explained that the Captain had refused the Spaniards access to the trunk, causing them to suspect it had been put ashore in Matanzas. Therefore, they decided to take the law into their own hands, and killed the Captain taking control of the ship. They determined that rather than continue to the United States they should instead sail for Europe and if Dobson would assist them he would be well paid for his services when the ship's cargo was sold. Dobson agreed and obtained permission to lay down. Tardy then asked him where Dolliver and Potter where. Dobson replied that they were in the Maintop. The two men were then asked to descend, repeatedly assured by Tardy that no harm would befall them. Doliver came down and was immediately stabbed by Courro and pushed overboard by Pepe. In the water, Doliver told Potter to stay where he was or he would certainly be killed. His last words were addressed to the Spaniards, saying that they were \\"barbarous and bloodthirsty wretches, equally destitute of courage and humanity\\". Shortly afterwards, Potter fell from the rigging landing heavily in the water with no struggle, causing Dobson to assume he was either dead or had fainted. As dawn arrived, Pepe and Courro came on deck with two muskets intent on shooting the Gibbs who had fled to the fore topmast. They called an injured Asa Bicknell up from below, who was bandaged and writhing in pain, Bicknell threw himself overboard and was shot at while falling by Courro. Pepe then also shot at Bicknell causing him to shriek. Pepe then descended into the cabin with a rope and returned to deck dragging behind him the dead Irish carpenter, who was then thrown overboard. The Gibbs was called for again and with repeated assurances of safety, the cook descended to the deck and was ordered to make breakfast. The deck and the rigging were then washed and sails painted to conceal the blood. Tardy dressed Dobson's wounds from his medicine chest, and assured him of his safety. They decided to go to Norfolk to resupply, on arrival they were spoken to by three separate pilot boat captains. Tardy told them he was a Spanish vessel from Matanzas, bound for Hamburg, he refused to take a pilot, saying he knew the bay. Tardy told Dobson he could still take his life and asked if he could trust Dobson to be silent. Dobson assured him that he could. Another pilot boat hailed them, Tardy refused them, but misunderstanding him the boat came alongside anyway. Dobson convinced Tardy that if he continued to refuse pilot it would be suspicious so Tardy consented. At 6:00 the evening of June 12, they anchored a hundred yards from shore at Old Point Comfort. Dobson asked Tardy to lower a boat and hand him an oar so that he could bring it alongside for Tardy. Tardy and Ginoulhiac lowered the boat, taking advantage of the moment Dobson then sculled quickly toward shore. Tardy seeing Dobson departing called after him \\"Mr. Dobson, are you going to betray me?\\" Dobson answered, \\"No\\". On reaching shore he related the occurrences aboard the Crawford to the officers at Fort Monroe, who then took possession of the vessel. Edmund Dobson of Somerset, MA, Ferdinand Ginoulhiac, and Stephen Gibbs were the only survivors. Felix, Cuorro, and Pepe were tried by Justice John Marshall in Richmond, VA and hung for piracy. DEATH Tardy was discovered in the Captains quarters where he had slit his own throat. He was buried at low tide mark face down at Old Point Comfort in front of Fort Monroe. (From Find a Grave) Phrenology On August 1, 1827, Dr. Brereton of the Washington Phrenological Society requested Tardy's skull for study. His body was exhumed and the skull prepared by J. Everett, a surgeon in the US Army stationed at Fort Monroe. The skull was transported to Washington, D.C. by Commodore John Rogers. Dr. Brereton made three casts of Tardy's skull. The casts were sent to Dr. George Douglas Cameron of the Liverpool Phrenological Society, Dr. Johann Spurzheim of the London Society of Phrenology, and Dr.George Combe founder of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society. The cast sent to Dr. George Combe is now in the collections of The Anatomical Museum of the School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.The Phrenological Journal and Miscellany Vol. V.

It was located on the east side of the Green River near the original Warren Bridge (named for local Missouri-born rancher J.J. Warren). Settled in the early 1900s, a post office was established in 1906, on the Pape Ranch. A community hall was constructed a half-mile to the east of the bridge, and foundations still remain. Many Bronx settlers came from Kansas. A store was opened here by C.Y Phillips; later R.T. Albert and Sons ran it. On the west side of the Green the Beaver School was built. Eventually it was moved near Cora. The Bronx School was located on the east side of the river; both were part of Sublette County School District Number 6. The schools were closed around 1948, but no transportation was provided to Pinedale, so they reopened in 1953, not finally becoming defunct until 1964–65. The area is now occupied by ranches of various sizes; the Bronx Community Club still includes women from hereabouts, as well as from Pinedale and Cora.

Lord Mansfield held, further, that only the members of the company itself (not a court) could determine the validity of the reasons. Facts Nine portmen (like aldermen, but town councillors of a port city) of the chartered Corporation of Ipswich claimed in a writ of scire facias that they had been ejected wrongfully and therefore that the contemporary portman was an impostor. It was alleged that they had wilfully failed to attend \\"four occasional great Courts\\". These were yearly public meeting events at the \\"Moot Hall\\" to conduct the borough's business. It was alleged by the town's bailiffs that the portmen should have attended every meeting. There was a hearing where the portmen gave reasons for not attending. However the bailiffs did not accept them, and the portmen were dismissed. After the nine portmen had been dismissed, an election meeting was held, and a bailiff, Thomas Richardson was chosen. The dismissed portmen alleged this was unlawful, because their dismissals were improper and so there was no vacancy. They argued the dismissals were improper both because it was \\"not a removal by the whole body, at a corporate assembly: but by a particular Court\\",(1758) 1 Burr 517, 526 and also because the cause was not enough to justify removal by those bailiffs. Judgment Lord Mansfield held that the portmen had been improperly dismissed, and so Richardson was not appointed as a new portman. The allegation was that the portmen had failed to attend meetings, a breach of a public duty. However, this could not in itself be a good reason for dismissal from office. Only the corporation as a whole could determine such a matter.

His grandson John Howard became Duke of Norfolk and was grandfather of both Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, wives of King Henry VIII. St German's church, Wiggenhall Origins Born about 1366, he was the son and heir of Sir Robert Howard (died 1389), of Wiggenhall, and his wife Margaret (died 1416), daughter of Robert Scales, 3rd Lord Scales, and his wife Catherine, the daughter of Robert Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk. His grandfather Sir John Howard (died 1364), had served as Admiral of the northern fleet from 1335 to 1337 and had married an heiress Alice, daughter of Sir Robert de Boys, of Fersfield. Career By 1380 he was married to an heiress and had been knighted by March 1387, when he served at sea in the fleet commanded by Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel that fought the French and their allies. In 1389 both his father and his father-in-law died, bringing him most of the paternal lands as well as those inherited by his wife, which he retained for life when she died in 1391. These estates gave him not only a considerable income but also local influence. In 1394 he was appointed a member of the Royal Household for life, serving in the English expedition that year against Ireland. In 1397, by which time he had married another heiress, he was made a justice of the peace (JP) for both Suffolk and Essex and in September was elected a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Essex. This Parliament was used by King Richard II to penalise his opponents and, on behalf of the Crown, Howard was empowered to seize the estates of rebel nobles and to collect large fines from the dissident counties of Essex and Hertfordshire. He then accompanied the King on his second expedition to Ireland in 1399. His position in the Royal Household was not renewed under the new reign of King Henry IV but he continued to sit as a JP and serve on royal commissions. He served the first of two terms as High Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire in 1400, during which he was summoned to the Great Council of August 1401, and was High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in both 1401 and 1402. In 1407 he returned to Parliament as MP for Cambridgeshire. In 1408 his wife's father died and she inherited his lands. Chosen again as Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire in 1414, he was involved in preparations for the first expedition to France of the new King, Henry V. In 1420 he was in difficulty over a feud in Suffolk with the influential MP Sir Thomas Kerdiston, which Sir Thomas Erpingham reported to the Privy Council, but by 1422 was sufficiently in favour locally to be elected Suffolk's MP. After sitting in this third Parliament, and following the death of his second wife in 1426, he took less part in local administration, though continuing as a JP and on royal commissions. In February 1436 he was asked to contribute 100 marks to the cost of the Duke of York’s expedition to France. He then went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where he died in Jerusalem on 17 November 1437. His remains were brought back to England and buried beside his second wife at Stoke-by-Nayland.St Mary's church, Stoke-by-Nayland Landholdings Through both his parents and through his two wives, he acquired estates in several adjoining counties, among them: :In Norfolk: Wiggenhall, Fersfield, East Winch, five manors near King’s Lynn, Garboldisham, Toft, Weeting and Knapton. :In Suffolk: Stoke-by-Nayland, Chelsworth, and Brook Hall near Dunwich. :In Essex: Stansted Mountfichet, Oakley and Moze. :In Cambridgeshire: Fowlmere. After the death of his eldest son in 1409, leaving an only daughter as heiress, he settled many of these properties on this granddaughter and, when she married in 1425, he assured John de Vere, her husband, that many more would follow. His second son then died in 1436, leaving a grandson, John Howard, as the heir to be provided for. After his own death in 1437, bitter feuds over the inheritance broke out between the de Veres and the Howards, which continued into the Wars of the Roses, in which both John de Vere and John Howard lost their lives. Family In about 1380 he married Margaret, daughter and heiress of John Plaiz, 5th Lord Plaiz, and his second wife Joan, daughter of Sir Miles Stapleton, of Bedale, and his second wife Joan, daughter of Sir Oliver Ingham. They had one son: :John (died 1409), who married Joan, daughter of John Walton, of Wivenhoe, and his wife Margaret Sutton, and had a daughter: ::Elizabeth (died 1475), who in 1425 married John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford. Margaret died in August 1391, and by June 1397 he had married Alice, only daughter and heiress of Sir William Tendring (died 1408), of Stoke-by-Nayland, and his wife Catherine (died 1402), widow of Sir Thomas Clopton, of Kentwell Hall at Long Melford, and daughter of William Mylde, of Clare. They had two sons: :Robert (died 1436), who in 1420 married Margaret (died 1459), daughter of Thomas Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk, and had three children, including: ::John, who became Duke of Norfolk. :Henry (died 1446).

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic though also saw service as a training vessel. She was named for Collingwood, Ontario. Background Flower-class corvettes like Collingwood serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Collingwood was ordered on 1 November 1940 as part of the 1939–1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down on 2 March 1940 by Collingwood Shipyards Ltd. at Collingwood, Ontario and launched 27 July later that year. She was commissioned on 9 November 1940 at Collingwood, the first corvette to enter Canadian service. In early December 1941 she went on a two-month refit at Halifax. Between 1942 and 1944 Collingwood had three minor refits. In October 1943, she was sent to New York for a major refit that lasted until December of that year, during which her fo'c'sle was extended. Service history After arriving at Halifax and completing her work up, Collingwood joined Halifax Force in January 1941. She worked with them until 23 May when she transferred to Newfoundland Escort Force (NEF). Beginning in June she spent the next six months escorting convoys from St. John's to Iceland. The first NEF convoy to face battle, HX 113, had three corvettes as part of the escort. However none of them had adequate communications equipment as they were only able to communicate through signals and not radio. This led to six losses and the escorts were only able to stop the attacks due to a reinforcement of Royal Navy escorts out of Iceland. After completing her working up after her first refit, Collingwood was assigned to the \\"Newfie\\" – Derry run, which were the Atlantic convoys that no longer switched escort groups near Iceland, but went all the way to the United Kingdom. She spent 1942 through to 1944 escorting convoys on this run. From December 1942 onward, Collingwood was a member of escort group EG C-4. From April 1945 until June 1945, Collingwood served as a training ship at Digby, Nova Scotia. Collingwood was paid off on 23 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold for scrapping in July 1950 and broken up at Hamilton.

Born in Sharon, Massachusetts, in 1869, he travelled to Washington State with his widowed father in 1890. He served as the founding President of the Natchez-Cowyche Ditch Company (precursor to today's Naches-Cowiche Canal Company) for three years from 1894 until 1897. He travelled to Egypt in the 1920s and returned with drawings of that nation's irrigation system that he shared with the Teiton-Naches project. Brackett was also involved in the civic development of Yakima, founding the Nob Hill Grange and eventually donating to the City of Yakima for the creation of Franklin Park.

The octopus has been used as a (usually negative) metaphor for entity which is perceived as sending out many \\"tentacles\\" from one \\"center\\" in order to exert power and control. Cartoons The first cephalopod character to play a title role in an American animated cartoon series was the Hanna-Barbera character, Squiddly Diddly. The cartoon series Oswald revolves around the life of the titular blue octopus and his friends. Cephalopods more commonly appear as supporting characters, or make guest appearances. Supporting characters in cartoons include Occy (Allstar's pet octopus) in Snorks, and Squidward Tentacles from the Nickelodeon series SpongeBob SquarePants. Squilliam Fancyson, is another cephalopod character from the same cartoon. Numerous cephalopods have made cameo appearances in the cartoon series Octonauts. The character Eight-Armed Willie from the animated series Flapjack is another example of a cephalopod cameo. In an episode of the computer animated series The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, entitled \\"Nightmare in Retroville\\", the main character transforms into an octopus. Comics Doctor Octopus and Lady Octopus are two supervillains from the Marvel Comics universe. The former was a scientist who augmented his human body by adding four mechanical arms (bringing his total number of limbs to eight). Another villain is Zitzbath Zark, otherwise known as the Octopus, from the hardboiled comic Spirit. The DC Comics hero Aquaman had a pet octopus named Topo who assisted him in a variety of ways, often taking advantage of his multiple limbs. Film 20,000 Leagues under the sea (1916) 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, based on the 1870 novel of that name by Jules Verne, is the best known representation of a giant cephalopod in cinema. The story's plot follows a group of humans who travel in a submarine called Nautilus (another cephalopod reference) and encounter a giant cephalopod. At least five film adaptions of the story exist (1907, 1916, Disney 1954, 1985 and 1997), variously presenting the monster as a squid or an octopus, or a fantastic combination of the two. Other films which feature giant cephalopods include It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955), Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961), Space Amoeba (1970), Tentacles (1977), Warlords of Atlantis (1978), Octopus (2000), Octopus 2: River of Fear (2001) Kraken: Tentacles of the Deep (2006) Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus (2009) and Arrival (2016). The Beast (1996) and Deep Rising (1998) both feature squid. Octopuses have also been depicted in cinema as hybrids, such as in Octaman, which features a mutant humanoid octopus. In the Disney animated movie The Little Mermaid, Ursula (the sea witch) is depicted as a human-octopus hybrid with the torso of a woman and the arms of an octopus in place of her legs. Monster Shark (1984) and Sharktopus (2010) feature fish-octopus hybrids. Cephalopods have been depicted in animated feature films for family audiences. Finding Nemo (2003) includes a flapjack octopus among its cast of aquatic characters. The sequel Finding Dory features an East Pacific red octopus as a major supporting character. Toy Story 3 (2010) features a toy rubber octopus named Stretch (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) and Shark Tale (2004) features an octopus named Luca (voiced by Vincent Pastore). An octopus named Dave (voiced by John Malkovich) is the main antagonist in the 2014 Penguins of Madagascar movie. The Australian animated film Dot and the Whale (1986) features a giant octopus with magical powers. Cuttlefish and their unique attributes have been a recurring topic or plot point in several major films. Captain Jack Sparrow asked feuding pirates to consider the cuttlefish and their capacity for cannibalism in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007). Cuttlefish and their hypnotic strobing ability were discussed as the greatest fear of the villainous Ulysses Klaue in Marvel Studios' Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). In the same year, the DNA of cuttlefish were discussed as contributing to the intelligence and camouflage of the monstrous Indominus Rex in the science fiction action film Jurassic World (2015). Literature Cthulhu is a fictional deity created by H. P. Lovecraft and first appearing in the short story \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\". Cthulhu is portrayed as a malevolent and powerful being that, though for the most part incomprehensible to human understanding, appears to have features reminiscent of an octopus and a dragon. Cthulhu appeared in the three-episode arc of the series South Park that began with the episode \\"Coon 2: Hindsight\\". Other prominent examples of cephalopods in literature include the man-eating squid species Haploteuthis ferox from H. G. Wells' short story \\"The Sea Raiders\\". In the Harry Potter franchise, a benevolent giant squid lives in the Black Lake, located next to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Music The Beatles song Octopus's Garden, the Syd Barrett song Octopus, the Bloc Party song Octopus and the Salmonella Dub song Octopus all incorporate octopuses in their song titles or lyrics. The song Giant Squids by Australian musician Baterz speculates about the lives of the animals. The Australian band Do Re Mi wrote and recorded a song called Cuttlefish Beach which appears on the album Domestic Harmony. The Australian children's musical group The Wiggles features an octopus as one of their mascots. = Electronic music = Several musicians, producers and composers of electronic music have names inspired by cephalopods. These include the chip-tune composer Cuttlefish, and the electronic music producers, Tron Sepia (whose name refers to a genus of cuttlefish). Cephalopods are reflected in track titles and the names of several record labels, including: Octopus Records, Octopus Black Label, Black Octopus Sound, Squid and the Stereo, Siamese Squids and Nautilus Recordz. As of 2016, Beatport's electronic music catalog includes 75 releases which include the word 'octopus' in their title. Some more creative cephalopod- inspired titles include the Spenghead tracks Gargantuan Cuttlefish Liasons and Romancing the Collossal Squid, the latter of which appears on an EP entitled The Cephalopod.  Video games  In the sandbox game Minecraft, squids are passive, non-playable characters that carry obtainable ink sacs. In the media franchise Pokémon, Omanyte, Omastar, Octillery, Inkay, Malamar, Clobbopus and Grapploct are all cephalopod-like organisms. Splatoon, a game by Nintendo released in 2015, features shapeshifting squid-children called Inklings as the player characters. A sequel, Splatoon 2, also released by Nintendo in 2017 featured Inklings and introduced playable shapeshifting octopus-children called Octolings as part of the Octo Expansion DLC. Night of the Cephalopods (2008) is a free retro pixel art survival game in which human players must fend off levitating cephalopods.

The service sprung up when Google removed social features from Google Reader; the site supports social media sharing, including the ability to \\"like\\" content, and find friends via social media networks. History The Old Reader was started as a hobby project by Elena Bulygina, Dmitry Krasnoukhov, and Anton Tolchanov. In March 2013, it only had 10,000 users, but started gaining popularity quickly after Google announced it would retire Google Reader. By the end of April 2013, the project already had 200,000 users and Anton had to quit, leaving just Elena and Dmitry. In August 2013, a month after Google Reader shut down, two remaining co-founders were struggling to keep the website running in the face of a large influx of new users. On July 29, The Old Reader team stated they had 420,000 registered users, with as many as 60,000 registrations in a single day. The team announced their intention to close the public version of the reader, leaving only a private website for a limited number of people. However, a few days later, another announcement stated that the website will remain public, with support from an unnamed \\"corporate entity in the United States\\". In November 2013, the team mentioned that the new owner was Levee Labs. The new team invested in hardware upgrade and changed the hosting provider, implemented a number of new features, including long-awaited browser bookmarklet. The founders of the site had publicly rejected ad-based tactics to support the service; the new team shares their vision, and in order to finance operations for the otherwise free application introduced a Premium service in February, 2014. Features The Old Reader is free for up to 100 feeds and offers a Premium version with full-text search and up to 500 subscriptions and 6 months of post storage. Former users of Google Reader or other RSS readers can import feeds via OPML export. A browser bookmarklet lets users send web pages directly to The Old Reader account. The service is integrated with Facebook or Google to help users find friends also using the site. There is also support for Readability, Instapaper, and Spritz, a service to help read content faster. Mobile applications The Old Reader has made its mobile API freely available to facilitate support for mobile applications. The service is supported by a number of mobile applications for all major platforms, including Reeder and Feeddler for iOS, Greader for Android (no longer available as of 2018), Old Reader for Windows Phone and ThOR for Symbian. Reception The Old Reader's reception was generally positive. PC Magazine praised its simple design and social aspects, but noted it lacked some of the features of its competitors. Dave Winer, one of the creators of RSS and other technology pundits have praised The Old Reader team's commitment to open web standards and delivering ad-free services, although as of 17 March 2015 the service includes \\"sponsored posts\\" inline with aggregated content.

Jay Taylor.\\"F. Jay Taylor Named as Louisiana Tech Head\\", Ruston Daily Leader, May 31, 1962 Background Ropp was born in Latty in Paulding County in northwestern Ohio, Ropp was one of two sons of Ohio native Edward F. Ropp (1867-1935) and the former Viola M. Finnegan (1874-1960), originally from Illinois. Until he was twelve years of age, Ropp attended a one-room school and then graduated in 1913 from Latty High Schoo1. In 1923, he received a Bachelor of Science degree from the private regional institution, Ohio Northern University in Ada in Hardin County. In 1955, Ropp received an honorary doctor of laws degree from his alma mater.Minden Press, May 19, 1955, p. 18. From 1927 to 1928, Ropp was the third national president of Alpha Phi Gamma (which later became part of Society of Collegiate Journalists) Oddly, a previous Louisiana Tech president, John Keeny, for whom the university administration building is named, had also studied at Ohio Northern; his field was music. On April 1, 1926, Ropp married the former Effie Lee Jones (1902-2000), an educator and a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The Ropps, who were United Methodist, had three children, Ralph Edwin Ropp (1928-1993), a colonel and director of internal information for the United States Army in Washington, D.C., later of DeRidder, Louisiana, Linda Lou Ropp May, and John M. Ropp (born 1930). In her later years, Effie Ropp had returned to live in Natchitoches, along with son John and daughter Linda May. After her mother's death, Linda May, divorced from Fred May of Seattle, Washington, subsequently left Natchitoches to return to Ruston. Academic career In 1925, Ropp procured a Master of Arts in English from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Before he came to Louisiana Tech, Ropp had been from 1923 to 1949 professor of speech and head of the forensics department at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana.\\"Louisiana Tech President Veteran's Day Banquet Speaker\\", Minden Press, Minden, Louisiana, November 4, 1954, p. 1 At Northwestern, Ropp in 1940 wrote the poem \\"Old Normal Hill\\" inscribed on a metal plaque on a stone monument on campus. Three of four white columns which supported the east gable of the Bullard Mansion remain on \\"The Hill\\". These columns are the unofficial symbol of NSU and were added in 1980 to the National Register of Historic Places. During Roth's tenure as president, sixteen major buildings on the Louisiana Tech campus were constructed. Seven academic departments were created, and the institution, then known as \\"Louisiana Polytechnic Institute\\", launched the first master's degree.\\"Golden Wedding Anniversary: Dr. and Mrs. R. L. Ropp\\", Ruston Daily Leader, March 25, 1976 The Ropp Center, first built on the Louisiana Tech campus in 1911 and formerly the home of the college president, is named in his honor. In his autobiography, Jasper \\"Jake\\" Smith, III (born 1935), a Louisiana Tech graduate and the older son of State Representative Jasper K. Smith of Vivian in Caddo Parish, describes with humor Ropp's attempt in 1957 to halt a panty raid, then a national fad, on campus: > The objective of this ritual was to get inside one of the girls' dormitories > and liberate some of their undergarments. ... It had been arranged on a late > spring night that some of the women in the female dormitory would leave a > door unlocked so that the \\"raiders\\" could get inside. ...

Old > Ralph got a little too close to one of the male dormitories, and someone > dumped a bucket of water from the third floor on his head. So the night was > not a total loss. ... In 1976, Ropp joined Mary Frances Fletcher, a Louisiana Tech English professor, in writing the book, Lincoln Parish History, intended for distribution in the bicentennial of the American Revolution. In 2013, busts of Ropp and his two successors, F. Jay Taylor and Daniel Reneau, were unveiled at Tech's Spirit Park located on campus between Davison Hall and the Biomedical Engineering Building. Busts of Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King Jr., Anne Frank, and Voltaire were already on display there. Ralph and Effie Ropp are interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Ruston.

He would at some stage have been a cotter or agricultural worker.Burns Chronicle. 1907. p.38 His brother William recorded in a letter dated 1781 that his brother lived in 'Stewarton' and that his circumstances were \\"rather indifferent.\\"Strawhorn, Page 29 Robert attended his brother William's funeral in 1784. Robert had severe rheumatoid arthritisStrawhorn, p.24 or osteoarthritis that prevented him from doing hard physical work in the cold winter months and to maintain himself and his family he opened a school in his home for the sons of local farmers sons. When his condition became too painful and debilitating he moved to a house in the Buck's Head Close or to the Buck's Head Inn itself, located just off the main street in Stewarton. Later he moved to another house in the town with his family. Caldhame Farm on the Robertland Estate was the home of Robert, his wife Agnes Craig and their family whilst he was a land steward between at least 1774 and 1784. The family were said to have been upright, respectable and \\"..never had much wealth and at times their circumstances were far from affluent.\\"Burns Chronciel 1911. p.93 =The Caldhame Letters= The memorial inscription on Robert and John's gravestone. Sir James Hunter Blair of Blairquhan uncovered six letters in his family's archive written between 1776 and 1779 by a Robert Burnes (never Burns) to the first baronet from Caldhame near Stewarton; a seventh letter was discovered recently by the Blairquhan Castle archivist.Jackson, Page 25 This individual was a land steward at the Robertland estate.Strawhorn, Page 23 William Logan, the Robertland Estate Factor living at Kilmaurs House or Place had employed a Robert Burnes and wrote a series of letters from May 1774 to 1784 to his employer that sometimes refer to a Robert Burnes.Strawhorn, Page 26 This Robert had detailed knowledge of selecting kilned lime and the liming of crops, caring for cattle, and drainage work. Deputising for the absentee factor he collected rents and wrote to the laird. The existence of another person with the same name, approximate age, knowledge of liming, both married, well educated, etc. and living in the same area seems very unlikely and the birth record of Robert Burnes to Agnes and Robert gives the dwelling as 'Caldhame'.Strawhorn, Page 26 Sir James Hunter Blair died in 1787 and this event may have impacted his employment. The Stewarton Parish Register of Births, Deaths and marriages records that this Robert Burnes had a son that was named Robert, registered on 29 January 1778, the mother being given as Robert's wife Agnes Craig and the residence is given as 'Caldhame'.Scotland's People A duplicate copy of the register confirms these details and gives the spelling 'Burnes'.

Agnes however died in October 1786 and was buried in Stewarton, East Ayrshire, ScotlandBurness Genealogy and Family History and was buried in Stewarton, probably in the Burnes family lair, but she is not recorded on the 1910 memorial itself. She died two years after her husband had written of her 'tender' condition. Robert and Agnes had four children of whom John (b. 15 September 1767, d. 17 February 1846) was the oldest son, followed by William (b. 23 Mar 1769, d. 1850) and a daughter Fanny (Frances) (b. circa 1772, d. 23 Apr 1839). Purdie, Page 56 Robert Burnes, baptised on 29 January 1778 is recorded as having died young and certainly before 1784 as his father does not list him in a letter to Robert Burns that year. Fanny Burnes Buck's Head Close, Stewarton. Fanny (b. circa 1772, d. 23 Apr 1839) moved to Ellisland Farm when her father died and married at Mauchline on 5 June 1792. Fanny's husband was Adam Armour, a builder, brother of Jean Armour, thereby Fanny became Jean's sister-in-law as well as her cousin-in-law. Adam Armour was immortalised in the poem \\"Adam Armour's Prayer\\" and the couple had five sons and four daughters. Adam was an adherent of the 'Auld Licht' persuasion and as such was in direct opposition to Robert Burns whose poem relates an incident regarding an Agnes Wilson, a maid at Poosy Nancy's, who was thought to be a prostitute. Adam Armour and a group of associates placed her on a pole and rode her out of town, injuring her private parts in the process. George Gibson, the landlord, attempted to take legal action and Adam hid until things quietened down. Burns records in the poem that she would have been hung had she been caught acting again as a prostitute.Noble & Hogg, Page 599 Fanny died in 1839. John Burnes John (b. 15 September 1767, d. 17 February 1846) and his birth was registered in the Parish of Irvine. he is known to have helped guard the Stewarton St Columba Church graveyard against the activities of body snatchers or resurrectionists,Milligan, Page 15 although it is not known if this was as a volunteer or in paid capacity. For the last sixteen years or so of his life he lodged at the house of the mother of James Colquhoun in Stewarton. Mrs Colquhoun had attended John's funeral.Annual Burns Chronicle XX, Page 96 John Burnes may have worked as a farm labourer or as a weaver, however in his final years from 1843 he was a recipient of poor relief from the Stewarton parish as noted in the Heritors Records,Strawhorn, Page 24 dying on 17 February 1846, aged 78 and buried next to his father under the 1910 memorial.Strawhorn, Page 24 William Burnes William (b. 23 Mar 1769, d. 1850) was intended to become a mason or building worker, working with James Armour, Robert Burns' father-in-law. He married Ann Newlands, fathering several children and dying in 1850 at an advanced age. Another source states that William never married and lived to an advanced age, dying in 1850. He had worked as a builder. His birth was registered in the parish of Irvine.

Several other members of the family were also buried in the lair.Burns Chronicle. 1907. p.39 On the day of the unveiling the Stewarton Burgh Band marched through the streets and Andrew Kerr, President of the Stewarton Literary Society hosted the proceedings. The whole project had originally begun following a talk delivered by Duncan McNaught of Kilmaurs and the honour was given to him to unveil the memorial.Annual Burns Chronicle, Page 96 Association with Robert Burns Lochridge old limestone quarry site. Robert Burns used to visit his uncle in Stewarton at the Buck's Head Close or at the Buck's Head Inn, one of the oldest buildings in the town, as he was sometimes in the area from late 1786 on his journeys to visit Frances Dunlop at Dunlop House nearby;Boyle, Page 145 he also visited nearby Robertland House.Boyle, Page 146 He is said to have stayed at the inn.Barclay, Page 43 When Robert Burnes died, his nephew Robert did what he could to help John, William and Fanny Burnes, his cousins, to gain employment. In February 1789 Robert Burns wrote from Ellisland Farm to his cousin, James Burnes in Montrose from Ellisland, saying: \\"We have lost poor uncle Robert this winter... His son William, has been with me this winter, and goes in May to bind himself to be a Mason with my father in law who is a pretty considerable architect in Ayrshire. His other son, the eldest, John, comes to me, I expect in Summer.... His only daughter, Fanny, has been with me ever since her father's death and I purpose to keep her in my family til she be quite woman grown, and be fit for better service. She is one of the cleverest girls, and has one of the most amiable dispositions, that I have ever seen.\\" Both John and Fanny therefore lived with the Burns family for a time from 1789 at Ellisland Farm.Mackay, Page 450 Chronology 1748 (Circa) - Robert living at Titwood Farm in Dreghorn Parish. 1766 - Robert (Aged 46/7) marries Agnes Craig at Dreghorn. 1767 - John Burnes born in Irvine. 1769 - William Burnes born in Irvine. 1771 - (Circa) Fanny (Frances) Burnes born. 1774 to 1784 - William Logan, Robertland Estate factor appoints Robert Burnes (aged 54/55) as a land steward.

This one-act social satire was first performed October 7, 1919 at the Maitland Playhouse, 332 Stockton Street, San Francisco, on a bill with three other one-act plays. The San Francisco Chronicle remarked that it \\"gayly lampoons the question of dinner entertainments\\". Arthur Maitland's company had just moved into a new 200-seat theater from its previous incarnation as the St. Francis Little Theatre Club in the Colonial Ballroom of the St. Francis Hotel. The play was originally published in the February 1920 issue of The Drama magazine. It is now a public domain work and may be performed without royalties.  Characters  The play has three characters: * Mrs. Horace Pringle, a woman of fashion * Elaine, a debutante and Mrs. Pringle's daughter * Dunham, the butler or maid  Synopsis  Mrs. Pringle is preparing to host a dinner party to introduce her daughter, Elaine, to the city's most eligible bachelor, Oliver Fransworth. Illness and a blizzard force some guests to cancel and the three characters are compelled to try to salvage the evening and the dinner-table layout. Reception Writing in The Drama magazine, J. Vandervoort Sloan described Gerstenberg as \\"a progressive young playwright, possibly the best-known and most widely be- played by amateur groups in America\\" and Fourteen as belonging \\"in the 'a' class of her plays\\". A reviewer for the American Library Association called it an \\"exemplary social farce\\". The play was among those \\"unqualifiedly recommended\\" for high-school productions in front of \\"mixed audiences\\" by a New Jersey public school drama adviser in 1923. The adviser described it as \\"portraying the contretemps of a dinner party\\". The play has continued to appeal to theater companies and audiences, with several modern productions. Reviewing a 2007 production in the New York Times, Anne Midgette described Fourteen as delightfully dated.

BIP; full legal name: Beogradska industrija piva, slada i bezalkoholnih pića a.d. Beograd) is a Serbian brewery, which declared bankruptcy in September 2015. It has a headquarters in Belgrade, Serbia. In addition to a range of beers, the brewery produces soft drinks, vinegar, and yeast.  History  = 19th century = The old Great Beer Hall in Belgrade. The brewery was founded in 1839, although it operates under current name ' since January 1963. BIP's 1839 predecessor was founded by the Czech miller expert Johan Weinhappl from Sremska Mitrovica. It was a manufacture for cooking of the \\"barley juice\\". At the time, the brewery was not on its present location. The brewery was moved to the neighborhood of Mostar, part of Senjak, in 1873, under the name of \\"Đorđe Vajfert's First Serbian Steam Brewery\\". The entire brewery complex was completed in 1880. After it was finished, the entire structure changed the urban physiognomy of this part of Belgrade. The brewery itself was designed by the foreign architects. Owner of the factory was industrialist Đorđe Vajfert. He studied beer brewing at College of Agriculture and Brewing near Munich, Bavaria. In 1892-1893, within the complex, Vajfert built a mansion which became known as Vajfert's Villa. The one-storey edifice was designed by engineer Jovan K. Ristić, in the Romanticist style. It became known for its interior, richly decorated woodworks, including the central wooden staircase. Close to the villa is the vast network of lagums, or underground corridors. The so-called Vajfert's storage cellars, the long and wide subterranean rooms were divided in 14 sections where beer was stocked in barrels and tanks. The villa became one of the most distinguished venue in Belgrade hosting numerous balls and receptions. = 20th century = Becoming one of the greatest industrialists in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Vajfert owned the brewery until his death in 1937. It was then inherited by his nephew Fernand Gamberg. The factory was damaged in both World Wars. After the Communist takeover in 1945, it was nationalized and repaired as the \\"7th of July\\" factory. On 23 January 1963, it merged into the Belgrade Beer Industry (BIP), together with the \\"Brewery Belgrade\\" (former \\"Bajloni Brewery\\" in Skadarlija) and \\"Bezalko\\" company. The brewery was modernized and expanded, while the only surviving part of the original complex was Vajfert's Villa. The malting section became operational in 1965 and was the only brewery in Serbia which produced malt. \\"Golden age\\" of the brewery were the 1970s. By the mid of the decade, the factory was brewing 1.5 million hectoliters per year, covering over one quarter of the market in the entire Yugoslavia. It was invested into the most modern equipment, including the Siemens control board which at that time only existed in NASA. After the collapse of the federal state in the early 1990s, the situation in the company worsened. It was especially hit after the major fire in the factory in 1997. = 21st century = Public bidding for the sale of the company in 2004 failed. In another attempt, in July 2007, the factory was sold to the Swedish-Lithuanian consortium. The consortium consisted of \\"United Nordic Beverages AB\\" and Alita for €26.5 million, for the 52% of the factory. In February 2010, the privatization was terminated, due to non-fulfillment of investment obligations. They clauses included not investing the additional €5.1 million, not buying off the rest of the shares and not paying the taxes. The consortium also administered the properties contrary to the contract: they sold the offshoot factories in the neighborhood of Krnjača and the town of Čačak and even pawned the company's brand for a credit of €1.1 million, without consulting the administrative board. In October 2012, Privatization Agency of Serbia announced that it had won the case against the former owners, meaning they will have to pay €17 million in the name of compensation. The malting section was repaired and became operational again. In 2014, the products of the factory were beer (80%), kvass (10%(, soft drinks (5%) and vinegar (5%). Still, the brewery entered the bankruptcy proceedings in September 2015, and officially went bankrupt in the early 2016. In April 2017, Macedonian investor leased brewery for the annual price of €900,000. Svetozar Janevski, owner of the \\"M6 EDEN SRB\\" company which leased the factory, and who also owns the Tikveš vinery and the Skopsko beer brewery (both in North Macedonia), announced that the old brewery will be operational for the next 2-3 years, until the new brewery is built on another location. He announced negotiations with the government to reach an agreement on the new location. New investor claimed that he is not interested in just taking the highly valuable land on an excellent location, but that he wanted to revitalize the beer production. However, in the early 2019 city announced new urban regulatory plan for the area where the brewery is, envisioning the conversion of the land from \\"economic\\" to \\"commercial\\". On 1 July 2019, Janevski broke the lease, claiming the \\"concept\\" of BIP has no future. In 2017, the brewery had a total loss of 51,5 million dinars (€435,000). Ministry of Economy stated that the brewery will not be shut down, instead, the state made a public offer for a new lease. The process failed as no one made an offer by 15 July 2019, but the production continued under the bankruptcy manager. By this time part of the complex dilapidated and went out of use, reducing the factory's capacity. The lagums haven't been inspected for a long time while the terrain of the complex is prone to the mass wasting. In 2009 the partial supporting wall was built to prevent the soil from moving while the unbuilt part of the complex became covered in overgrowth. In November 2019 city published the detailed regulatory plan for the area, work of urbanists Radmila Grubišić and Milica Andrejić. It anticipates the complete demolition of the entire complex and construction of the commercial neighborhood with hotels, business offices and malls. The only surviving part of the former complex will again be the Vajfert's Villa, which was placed under the preliminary protection. A minimal beer production in some of the new objects may be preserved for the touristic purposes. One of the pre-war inheritors, the Veljković family, threatened to sue the state because the factory is not returned to them in the process of restitution. In February 2020, director of the Restitution Agency, Strahinja Sekulić, said that they decided not to return the factory as the natural restitution, but instead to financially compensate the shareholders (including the Veljkovićs), as the brewery was the joint-stock company when nationalized. On 14 March 2020, the leakage of ammonia was reported from the brewery. White ammonia smoke covered the area, and 18 people were hospitalized.

Early career  Born as Carlo Villa to a humble family in Piacenza, Negrini studied first in the Regia Scuola di Musica and then in Parma. A sponsor made it possible for him to study in Milan with Bartolomeo Prati. The impresario Angelo Boracchi advised him to change his name to Carlo Negrini, claiming it will bring him luck.Christian Springer, Giuseppe Verdi. Leben, Werke, Interpreten, epubli, Berlin, Negrini started singing in the La Scala chorus, soon making his début as a soloist in 1847 as Jacopo in Giuseppe Verdi's I due Foscari. From 1850 on, he sang major roles in Italy and Europe.  European career and role creations  In 1850 Negrini sang Gastone in Gerusalemme, the Italian language version of Giuseppe Verdi's Jerusalem, a French language re-make of I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata , in La Scala. In 1851 he sang he sang Rodolfo in Verdi's Luisa Miller, Duca in Verdi's Rigoletto and the title role of Donizetti's Poliuto at the Teatro Riccardi in Bergamo (1851). In 1852, he appeared as Pollione in Norma and the title role of Verdi's Ernani at Covent Garden. In Bologna he sang in Balfe's La zingara and in Verdi's Luisa Miller. In Venice La fenice he sang in Errico Petrella's Marco Visconti (1854) and Giuseppe Apolloni's L'ebreo. In La Scala he created the roles of Don Rodrigo in Giovanni Pacini’s Il Cid, (1852), Gabriele Adorno in Verdi’s Simon Boccanegra (1857), Glauco in Errico Petrella’s Jone (1858) and Cola di Rienzi, in Achille Peri’s Rienzi, (1862). Other roles he created were Adel-Muza in Giuseppe Apolloni’s L’ebreo in La Fenice, (1857) and Galieno in Errico Petrella’s Morosina ovvero L'ultimo de' Falieri in Naples (1860). In the spring of 1860 he created the title role of Luigi Moroni's Amleto at the teatro Apollo in Rome, singing with the aging Filippo Coletti as Cladio. A year later, again with Coletti, he created the role of Icilio in Petrella's Virginia in Naples.  Premature death  Having sung most of Verdi's operas written in Negrini's short lifetime, Negrini paved the way as model for the Verdi tenor known today. Negrini was treated like a modern-day star. In Palermo he received the vast fee of 22,500 lire, unheard of at the time. In 1865, returning home from performing in Spain, he suffered a stroke. A second stroke, while in Paris, left him bedridden for nine months until he died at the age of forty.Elizabeth Forbes. \\"Negrini, Carlo.\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Ed. Stanley Sadie. Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press.  Verdi and Negrini  Negrini was a baritonal tenor. The tessitura for the role of Gabriele Adorno he created was so middle voiced, that Verdi later authorised transpositions up for the tenor Emilio Pancani in 1869Harold Powers One Halfstep at a Time: Tonal Transposition and 'Split Association' in Italian Opera, Cambridge Opera Journal, Vol. 7, No. 2 (July 1995), pp. 135–164 and Francesco Tamagno in 1881. Verdi appreciated Negrini's talent and stipulated in a contract Negrini's participation in an opera project for Naples.Frank Walker, Unpublished Letters, in Verdi, Instituto di studi Verdiani, 1960, p. 41 Verdi also sent his friend and student Emanuele Muzio to Venice to listen to Negrini in Appoloni's Adelchi. \\"Negrini is always a great artist, he is a genius\\", Muzio reported;Letter from January 4, 1857, Negrini in Eduardo Rescigno, VivaVerdi: Dalla A alla Z Giuseppe Verdi e la sua opera, Bur Saggi, Rizzoli, 2012, \\"When Negrini is well he is a real gem.\\"Letter from January 29, 1857  Appreciation  The Belgian critic and musicologist François- Joseph FétisNegrini (Carlo Villa, dit), in François-Joseph Fétis, Biographie universelle des musiciens et bibliographie générale de la musique. Supplément et complément, Vol. 2, Parigi, Firmin-Didot, 1878–1880, p. 266 described Negrini's voice as 'superb, powerful and well produced' (“superbe, puissante et bien timbrée”). Francesco Regli in his biographical dictionaryNegrini Carlo, in Francesco Regli, Dizionario biografico dei più celebri poeti ed artisti melodrammatici, Enrico Dalmazzo, Torino, 1860 claimed 'Negrini possesses an imposing voice with lots of soul, taking possession of the stage: qualities needed to be able to execute adequately the music composed nowadays, where less than a mere singer, a great actor is needed. Thus his voice showed no fatigue despite the lengthy labours!' (“Il Negrini possiede una voce prepotente e molt' anima, ed è padrone della scena: doti necessarie per poter eseguire con generale soddisfacimento le musiche del giorno, nelle quali vi vuole, non men che il cantante, l'attore. Cosi la sua voce non fosse un po' stanca dalle lunghe fatiche!”). The Musical World of 1854 reports on his Covent Garden performance: \\"Negrini is the most perfect Carlo that can be imagined; He excited the wonder and delight of the audience by the fullness of his tone, the richness of his voice, and still more by his inimitable accent, his energy, and the perfection of his acting.The Musical World, Vol. 32 London, Boosey and Sons, 1854, p. 405  Roles created  * Ramiro, in Zulima, Bernardo Geraci, Reggio Teatro Carolino, Palermo, 1851 * Silvio, in Matilde Bentivoglio, Pietro Platania, Reggio Teatro Carolino, Palermo, 1851 * Don Rodrigo, in Il Cid (Giovanni Pacini), Teatro alla Scala, Milan, March 12, 1853 * Gilberto in Editta, (Antonio Buzzi), Teatro la Fenice, 1854 * Adel-Muza, in L'ebreo, (Giuseppe Apolloni), Teatro la Fenice, Venice, January 23, 1855 * Adelchi, in Adelchi, (Giuseppe Apolloni), gran Teatro La Fenice, 1856 * Ulrico, in Valenzio Candiano, (Tomaso Benvenuti), teatro Sociale di Mantova, 1856 * Gabriele Adorno, in Simon Boccanegra (Giuseppe Verdi), Teatro la Fenice, Venice, March 12, 1857 * Glauco, in Jone ovvero L'ultimo giorno di Pompei, (Errico Petrella), Teatro alla Scala, Milan, January 26, 1858 * Adalberto, in Berengario d'Ivrea, (Francesco Lutti), Teatro alla Scala, Milan, 1858 * Galieno, in Morosina ovvero L'ultimo de' Falieri, (Errico Petrella), Teatro San Carlo, Naples, January 6, 1860 * Decio, in Mirinda, (Salvatore Pappalardo), Teatro San Carlo, Naples, March 6, 1860 * Amleto, in Amleto, (Luigi Moroni), Teatro Apollo, Rome, spring 1860 * Icilio, in Virginia, (Errico Petrella), Teatro San Carlo, Naples, July 23, 1861 * Ezzelino Cornaro, L'uscocco, (Francesco Petrocini), regio teatro alla Scala, 1862. * Ariodante, in Ginevra di Scozia, (Giuseppe Rota), Gran teatro Trieste, automn 1862 * Cola di Rienzi, in Rienzi, (Achille Peri), Teatro alla Scala, Milan, December 26, 1862 * Loreno in Aurora di Nevers, (Giuseppe Sinico), Teatro Carcano, Milan, 1863  Verdi roles (incomplete list) * Gaston in Gerusalemme, Milan, 1850 * Duca in Rigoletto, Ancona, 1854 *Giovanna d'arco in Ancona *Gabriele Adorno in Simon Boccanegra Venice, 1857 * Luisa Miller, BolognaLe opere di Giuseppe Verdi a Bologna (1843–1901): con una appendice su Bologna e la morte di Giuseppe Verdi, LIM (1900)  References   External links  * Photograph of Negrini in costume Category:1826 births Category:1865 deaths Category:Italian operatic tenors Category:People from Piacenza Category:19th- century Italian opera singers Category:19th-century male singers ","title":"Carlo Negrini"},{"id":"40161954","text":"Cham-e Gardel () is a village in Pataveh Rural District, Pataveh District, Dana County, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran.

At the time Provan Gasworks had an extensive gauge railway running through the gas works and Dougal was one of the many engines built to run on it. Gas works lines like this usually meant working in the very restricted confines of retort houses, explaining Dougal's small and especially low shape. In 1958 the gas works were closed and Dougal was no longer required. In 1961 Dougal was saved from scrap and later sold to the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. = Welshpool and Llanfair Railway = In 1969 Dougal was bought by the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway and was first steamed there in 1975. Although too small to operate the standard service on the railway it is steamed regularly at bank holidays and gala weekends, where it can often be seen shunting between Llanfair Caereinion and Cyfronydd. It is currently awaiting funding for a new boiler.

In 2010, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics presented Boeing Jr. with a certificate of achievement for his commitment to education and the preservation of air and space history. Boeing Jr. had fond childhood memories of the Red Barn, the birthplace of the Boeing Company, where he was once given a piece of balsa wood he crafted into a model ship. He did not understand his father's importance until his classmates nicknamed him after one of the Boeing airplanes. In the late 1970s he was instrumental in ensuring that the Red Barn, the oldest airplane manufacturing facility in the U.S., was preserved and integrated into the Seattle Museum of Flight.

The FIM was developed as a candidate to eventually supplant the Global Forecast System, the United States's current medium-range forecast model. The FIM was originally slated to become operational some time in 2014 but never did so. The model produces similar results to the GFS, but runs slower on the NWS's operational computers. Its three-part name derives from its key features: \\"flow-following\\" indicates that its vertical coordinates are based on both terrain and potential temperature (isentropic sigma coordinates, previously used in the now-discontinued rapid update cycle model), and \\"finite-volume\\" describes the method used for calculating horizontal transport. The \\"icosahedral\\" portion describes the model's most uncommon feature: whereas most grid-based forecast models have historically used rectangular grid points (a less than ideal arrangement for a planet that is a slightly oblate spheroid), the FIM instead fits Earth to a Goldberg polyhedron with icosahedral symmetry, with twelve evenly spaced pentagons (including two at the poles) anchoring a grid of hexagons. In November 2016, the ESRL announced it was no longer pursuing the FIM as a replacement for the GFS and would be instead developing the FV3, which uses some of the FIM's principles except on a square grid. The FIM will continue to be run for experimental purposes until FV3 commences. The FIM will also be upgraded with some of the same features as FV3 (retaining the icosahedral grid) and coupling to examine the use of the model in the longer ranges. The FIM runs as a multiscale model, with a suffix number indicating the model's horizontal resolution. FIM7 operates at a spatial resolution of approximately 60 km, FIM8 at 30 km, FIM9 at 15 km and FIM9.5 at 10 km. Each scale runs on a temporal resolution of 6-hour steps. As of 2017, only the FIM7 (running out 10 days) and FIM8 (running out 14 days) continue to be run daily. The FIM7 also runs four runs between Tuesday and Wednesday each week as a climate model, with the mean output from those runs issued in one-week intervals; it thus complements the Climate Forecast System, the only other model in the U.S. government's arsenal that covers that time frame.

The four-story building has a free standing water tower that powered a water sprinkler system. The tower is an important landmark on the city's skyline. In 1999 the building was re-purposed as the Hotel at Old Town, which includes a large collection of Keen Kutter hardware on display. History This building displayed the owners as the \\"Morton Simmons Hardware Co.\\" and it had Keen Kutter logos on its tower. Keen Kutter was a trademark owned by the Simmons Hardware Company. Simmons was the first company to establish a nationwide brand for hardware based on the idea of a catalogue; theirs was called the \\"Hardware Encyclopedia\\". These catalogues included thousands of illustrated pages that allowed the purchaser to select items. The goods were sent by rail, direct to one of the warehouses. This building was a warehouse supplied by a spur line of the Frisco Railway to nine shipping bays. There is little evidence of the bays today.National Register nomination, kshs.org, accessed 6 August 2013 dock a dog's tail with an axe. The Morton Simmons Hardware Company building. Note the railway car delivering goods. Simmons products were supplied to customers via warehouses like this one in six states. The other warehouses were in New York, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, and the warehouse at Sioux City in Iowa. The warehouse's stock included ammunition, lawn mowers, axes, knives, wires, and cutlery. The company's motto was, \\"If you can't eat it, and it don't pour or fold, it's hardware\\". This building was constructed in 1905–1906, designed by the St. Louis architects Mauran, Russell and Garden, and was strongly based on the Cupples Building in St Louis.History, Hotel at Old Town, accessed 6 August 2013 The building was constructed in brick by the Wurster Construction company. The tall free standing tower was designed to be and became an important landmark. On each side of the building the owners advertised their name. The faded remains of the logos for \\"E.C.Simmons - Keen Kutter\\" and the subsequent owners \\"Harwi\\" can still be seen today (2013). The tower's more practical purpose was to hold of water that could be delivered to sprinklers on each of the four floors in the event of a fire. This was a modern purpose-built building that is estimated to have cost $250,000 at the time of its construction. The design included electric elevators, an internal telephone system and messenger call boxes. An unusual part of the design was the offices, which were situated to maximize their use of natural light. These offices were placed in a wide strip that stretched along the south side of the first (ground level) and second stories. On the ground floor was a sample room where the company's goods were displayed and a room with easy chairs that was available to both customers and employees. The Simmons company designed their buildings for efficiency and were known to employ the leading time and motion pioneer Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr. In the 1920s the Winchester Repeating Arms Company diversified to include knives and hardware. They merged with the Simmons Hardware Company. During the 1920s this warehouse was at the disposal of the merged Winchester and Simmons company. The Winchester and Keen Kutter brands did good business but in 1929 they agreed to separate and Simmons and this building returned to their core business. The Keen Kutter tools that were stored and sold from this warehouse are now collectibles. The contemporary book Keen Kutter Planes lists over 800 items from the brand. After Simmons and Winchester The building was sold in October 1929 to Alfred Jonathon Harwi who had a Kansas-based hardware company. The Harwi company started in 1875 and was incorporated in 1889. The Harwi company had a slightly smaller building of , based in Atchison, Kansas.Alfred Jonathon Harwi , William E. Connelley, Kansas State Historical Society, 1918, accessed 6 August 2013 Harwi's purchase of the Wichita building was the same year that Simmons and the Winchester became separate companies again. The building was later purchased by Jack deBoer, a local hotel owner, who had the building converted into a hotel. The new 115-room hotel opened as the \\"Hotel in Old Town\\" in 1999. The hotel has purchased what it claims to be the \\"largest authentic collection ever assembled\\" of Keen Kutter hardware which are displayed on all the floors like a private museum focusing on Keen Kutter and old Wichita.

Uruguay gained independence and sovereignty from Spain in 1828 and has full control over its internal and external affairs. From 1973-85 Uruguay was governed by a civil- military dictatorship which committed numerous human rights abuses. Uruguay is generally committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and ranks as the most rights conscious nation in South America. However areas of concern remain, including inhumane prison facilities, access to justice for crimes committed as a result of the dictatorship and discrimination towards women.  Legal framework  = International obligations = Uruguay has signed and ratified most of the international human rights treaties without reservations, including: * International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) * International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) * International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) * Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) * Convention against Torture (CAT) Uruguay has also ratified both Optional Protocols to the ICCPR. Uruguay has one general reservation/declaration with regard to article 38, paragraphs 2-3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) which deals with youth involvement in armed conflict.Universal Periodic Review:UN Compilation Report:A/HRC/WG.6/18/URY/2 (3 November 2013), p. 2 Uruguay is subject to the Universal Periodic Review process as it is a member state of the United Nations. It has completed two rounds of the Universal Periodic Review, the latest in 2013. Uruguay has recognised the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights as a member of the Organisation of American States. On 18 March 2005 Uruguay extended a “standing invitation” to all visits from the UN Special Procedures. In 2007 this invitation was also extended to the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. =National institutions= In 2008, the National Institution for Human Rights (INDDH) was established to “defend, promote and protect” human rights in Uruguay. The agency advises on the signing and ratification of international treaties, implementation of practices to protect human rights and to investigate violations of human rights. Various other institutions exist to promote human rights in particular areas of government, such as: *Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Prison System *Office of the Ombudsman *Human Rights Board of the Ministry of Education and Culture *Human Rights Advisory Office of the Judiciary of Uruguay The Commission Against Racism, Xenophobia, and All Forms of Discrimination was created in 2007 however it has not had an allocated budget since 2010, and the terms of its members have lapsed. =Constitution= The Constitution of Uruguay sets out provisions for Uruguay's governance. The Constitution of Uruguay is supreme law and under Article 256 the Supreme Court of Justice may declare laws to be unconstitutional. It prescribes the powers and functions of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Government. It specifically grants all persons equality before the law and Section Two specifically recognises a number of fundamental rights. Article 72 stipulates that the rights listed are not exhaustive and includes other rights “inherent in human beings or which are derived from a republican form of government.” Article 332 also states that it is immaterial if no specific regulation exists for individual rights proclaimed in the Constitution as general principles of justice and doctrine are analogous.  Human rights issues  = Nationality problem = According to the Uruguayan constitutions and the law 16.021 title=Nationality law of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, Art. 16.021url=https://legislativo.parlamento.gub.uy/temporales/leytemp5525720.htm Legal citizens of Uruguaytitle=legal citizen of Uruguayurl=https://www.corteelectoral.gub.uy/tramites/carta_de_ciudadania#:~:text=%C2%BFQui%C3%A9nes%20tienen%20derecho%20a%20la%20Ciudadan%C3%ADa%20Legal%3F&text;=a)%20Los%20hombres%20y%20mujeres,residencia%20habitual%20en%20la%20Rep%C3%BAblica. are not able to obtain Uruguayan nationality, and people who have Uruguayan nationality can not give up their Uruguayan nationality either. It is against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 15. It clauses of a lot of problems in international travel, jurisdiction, investment, property ownership, asset declaration, marriage, extradition, discrimination, etc. Legal citizens of Uruguay have the right to obtain a Uruguayan passport. = Right to life = The death penalty has been abolished in Uruguay. =Freedom of expression= Freedom of speech is guaranteed in the Constitution. This includes freedom in all methods of dissemination including freedom of the press. The government generally respects these rights. In 2012 the government decreed that digital television would be free and unrestricted throughout Uruguay. In 2014 the passage of the Law of Audiovisual Communication Services was hailed by human rights groups as a model for Latin American freedom of expression. The law works to reduce media concentration and create a conscience clause for journalists. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression noted that there are occasional cases of violence and intimidation against journalists such as the 2011 assault on Luis Diaz by police in Salto. Uruguay has made progress in reforming the use of defamation suits when a public interest is present but such suits can still result in impeding journalistic investigations. =Freedom of religion= The Uruguayan Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and declares that the State supports no particular religion. Some argue Uruguay goes further than simple neutrality and is in fact secular fundamentalist. Religious education is not provided and banned in public schools and is regarded by the State as being a private practice. The State has co-opted the traditional religious holidays and renamed them along secular lines (Easter as “Tourism Week”). There are sporadic reports of abuse based on religious discrimination, including anti-Semitism, but victims report helpful cooperation with the police on investigating these matters. =Electoral rights= The Uruguayan Constitution establishes an electoral democratic republic. Legislative authority is vested in the bi-cameral General Assembly and the Executive takes the form of a President and appointed Cabinet. Each is elected for a five-year term by universal suffrage. Non-citizens domiciled in Uruguay for at least 15 years and who possess capital in the country may vote. The General Assembly is elected by closed list proportional representation and the President via a majority runoff. Uruguay also provides a system of popular referenda.Universal Periodic Review:National Report:A/HRC/WG.6/5/URY/1 (24 February 2009), para. 6 This method of direct democracy allows citizens to ratify Parliamentary reforms, demand the repeal of laws and institute new law through popular proposal. Uruguay has strong anti-corruption legislation, in particular the Transparency Law (Law Cristal) which introduces criminal liability for a number of actions of public officials such as laundering of public funds. Furthermore, Uruguay recently introduced gender quotas for election cycles, requiring equal representation on candidate shortlists.Universal Periodic Review:UN Compilation Report:A/HRC/WG.6/18/URY/2 (3 November 2013), para. 67 =Freedom from torture and cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment= Uruguay has signed the main international treaties banning the act of torture such as the CAT and the ICCPR, including the Optional Protocols to the ICCPR and CAT that recognise the jurisdiction of the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture to receive and consider complaints regarding torture and inhumane treatment.Human Rights Council: Report of Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: A/HRC/13/39/Add.2 (21 December 2009), para.10 The Constitution does not contain a clear freedom from torture provision but it does give the right to enjoy life, liberty, security and property. The Penal Code contains provisions criminalising abuse of authority by public officials in the prison system and article 22.1 of the Law on Cooperation with the International Criminal Court in Matters of the Fight against Genocide, War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity criminalises torture by any State agent, including cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment.Human Rights Council: Report of Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: A/HRC/13/39/Add.2 (21 December 2009), para.17-19 However, the Special Rapporteur on Torture (SR) has noted that this law is not likely to be utilised for individual crimes but rather grouped as crimes against humanity and urged reform to change this.Human Rights Council: Report of Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: A/HRC/13/39/Add.2 (21 December 2009), para.21 Torture is not a systematic problem however police and other authorities do occasionally infringe on prisoners’ rights. There are reports of beatings and the excessive use of force by police and prison staff.Universal Periodic Review:UN Compilation Report:A/HRC/WG.6/18/URY/2 (3 November 2013), para. 31 The Special Rapporteur noted that prison conditions are an issue and amounted to cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment. The prison system in Uruguay in 2013 was at 125% capacity and the SR found that conditions were “an insult to human dignity”.Human Rights Council: Report of Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: A/HRC/13/39/Add.2 (21 December 2009), para.45 It was found that prisoners had restricted access to water, toilets, medical attention, and a lack of space to sleep and were allowed out of their cells for only four hours a week.Human Rights Council: Report of Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: A/HRC/13/39/Add.2 (21 December 2009), para.46 This was not uniform throughout the prisons and some prisoners of an elevated economic and social status enjoyed far better facilities. The SR found that almost all the problems were a result of a flawed criminal justice programme.Human Rights Council: Report of Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: A/HRC/13/39/Add.2 (21 December 2009), para.77 Extensive use of pre-trial detention and a slow judicial system has resulted in the overcrowding as well as the mixing of pre-trial detainees and convicted prisoners, a violation of the Presumption of innocence. It is reported that 68% of all prisoners are awaiting trial. Uruguay has made progress since the visit of the Special Rapporteur. An Emergency Prison Law has given more funding for prison facilities and allows prisoners to be held in military facilities to ease the overcrowding. In his follow up visit the SR found improvements and increases in some prison facilities and reforms to the penitentiary supervision system but again urged the Government to continue to pursue comprehensive criminal justice reform. =Access to justice/impunity= Uruguay's disappeared people From 1973-1985 Uruguay was ruled by a military dictatorship. During this time a number of human rights abuses were committed including the use of torture, unlawful detention and enforced disappearances. In order to prevent a further coup, when democracy was restored to Uruguay the Government passed the Ley de Caducidad de la Pretensión Punitiva del Estado or Amnesty/Expiry Law in 1986 which protected the military and police from prosecution for crimes committed during the dictatorship. Article 4 of the Act withdrew the right of the judiciary to investigate abuses in favour of executive control. The judiciary still took cases in order to pressure the Government into using its Article 4 powers and high-profile cases such as the Elena Quinteros case achieved this. President Vasquez opened up cases occurring before the coup for investigation. By 2011 the Supreme Court had pronounced the Expiry Law unconstitutional in three separate cases. Pressure from the Gelman v Uruguay decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights led to the repeal of the Expiry Law in 2011 with the passage of Act No. 18.831. However recent events have continued to undermine the access to justice for the victims of the dictatorship and once again risked non-compliance with international human rights standards. In 2013, the Supreme Court found Act No 18.831 to be unconstitutional as a statute of limitations should apply to the period of dictatorship and that the crimes committed during that time should not be classified as crimes against humanity.Human Rights Council:Summary of stakeholder information:A/HRC/WG.6/18/URY/3 (7 November 2013), para.42 The decision applied only to the case in particular but demonstrates a lingering unwillingness to give justice. Amnesty International has found that little progress has been made since the decision in ensuring the crimes were accounted for. The Committee on Enforced Disappearances noted in its 2013 report that the Supreme Court decision declared persons missing for more than 30 years were held to be dead and is an issue of homicide thus blunting efforts to investigate the enforced disappearances.Committee on Enforced Disappearances:Concluding Observations on Uruguay:CED/C/URY/CO/1 (8 May 2013), para.13 =Women's rights= Under law, women have equal treatment. Gender equality is enshrined in a number of laws such as:Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women:Consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women:CEDAW/C/URY/7 (21 June 2007), p.9 *Law 16,045 barring discrimination in the workplace *Article 321 of the Penal Code makes domestic violence a distinct offence *Law 17,823 which gives juveniles the right to be treated under conditions of equality *Law 17,817 deals with racism and all forms of discrimination Violence towards women is also an issue and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture noted that the State's response was not adequate especially its failure to carry out the Action Plan on Fighting Domestic Violence. Human rights groups have also noted that there had been an increase in domestic violence complaints and state programmes had been unsuccessful at reducing the number of deaths of women.Human Rights Council:Summary of stakeholder information:A/HRC/WG.6/18/URY/3 (7 November 2013), para.27-28 In 2012 abortion was decriminalised however there are obstacles to accessing the procedure such as a compulsory five-day wait and a review by an expert panel. In the event of pregnancy from rape, the rape victim must lodge a complaint with police before an abortion can be sanctioned. This is a problem as anecdotal evidence suggests some rape victims do not file complaints due to social stigma and a fear of retribution. Access to sexual and reproductive health is generally good with contraception provided for free. Since 2004 there has been a significant increase in the number of family planning services throughout Uruguay.Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women:Consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women:CEDAW/C/URY/7 (21 June 2007), p.57 Despite the legal provisions, in some cases women still have to confront inequality such as in employment or wage inequality.

The novel is set in a fictional near future in which the UK's recent withdrawal from the EEC has brought the country to the verge of bankruptcy. Plot summary Emma, 20, lives with her elderly grandmother, Mad (short for ‘Madam’), a famous retired actress, in the small village of Poldrea in Cornwall. They share a large house near the coast with Mad's six ‘maladjusted’ adopted sons who range in age from 3 to 18. One morning, Emma wakes to the sound of aeroplanes overhead. An American warship has anchored in the bay and United States Marines are marching over the fields. They are trigger-happy, and one of them shoots and kills a local farmer's dog. After some hours of civil confusion, a TV announcement is made by the prime minister: due to recent economic and military failures on the continent, the UK and the USA have joined together as a single nation, to be called USUK. The new government of USUK declares a state of emergency, institutes roadblocks, and cuts local telephone and postal communication. To Mad and her family the US Marines appear less like invited friends than a hostile invading force. Andy, 12, one of Mad's adopted boys who has an obsession with bows and arrows and a hazy understanding of the concepts of right and wrong, shoots and kills one of the Marines. Mad, Emma and some of the locals cover up the death, and throw the body over the cliff into the sea. It is not found for several days, and in the absence of a culprit the military authorities crack down on the local population by cutting food, electricity and water supplies, and arresting and taking into custody all the local men and youths. Mad encourages the local farmers to an act of civil disobedience in which huge piles of rotting manure are dumped in front of the local pub where the military authorities have arranged their thanksgiving celebrations. Shortly afterwards, there is a huge explosion which sinks the warship in the bay. Nobody knows the cause, but in a televised speech the prime minister hints of sabotage \\"by unknown agents hostile to USUK”. Mad and her family retreat to their cellar, where they subsist for several days on apples and beetroot, and water from a re-opened well. Early in the morning Emma and the boys are woken by aircraft and what appears to be gunfire, explosions and depth charges, while Mad sleeps on. Power has been restored, and a TV announcer states that the sinking of the American warship may have been caused by torpedo action. In any event, the security regulations have been relaxed, and the Marines are to leave the local area. A stream of helicopters flies overhead, leaving Cornwall. The local doctor arrives in his Land Rover. Emma notices Mad standing in welcome at her porch, but when she realises that nobody else can see her she tells the doctor that he had better go down into the basement, where Mad has been asleep for a very long time. The novel concludes with the helicopters still flying eastward into the sun. Dedication The book is dedicated to the actress Gladys Cooper, who died in 1971. Cooper had been one of the leading ladies of Daphne's father, the actor and impresario Gerald du Maurier.Westland, Ella, introduction to Rule Britannia, Virago Press, 2004 Background Du Maurier started work on the novel early in 1972, following up an idea she had had for \\"a funny novel … mocking everything\\". It was to be \\"a mockup of what this country may be like in the mid-seventies”, and on its completion she was sure that she had pulled off a fast and funny piece of satire that would be \\"popular autumn reading\\". Critical reception Reviewers did not share the author's opinion of her work, and most notices were unenthusiastic. There was general consensus that, at best, the novel was pedestrian and, at worst, it was plain silly. Du Maurier's biographer, Margaret Forster, called it in 1993 \\"the poorest novel she ever wrote\\". Ella Westland, in her introduction to the 2004 Virago reprint, called the tone of the book \\"mocking\\" – shifting from the funny and farcical to the bleak and bizarre. Du Maurier's publishers were worried by the implausible plot, and it bemused many of her readers. Yet, Westland said, the novel is held together by its very absurdity. She noted that the author had known the story of Peter Pan since early childhood, her father Gerald du Maurier having regularly played Captain Hook on stage since before Daphne was born, and she held that the novel can be read as “Peter Pan meets the Marines, with Emma playing Wendy to Mad’s Peter Pan”. Mad's boys are the six Lost Boys adopted by the Darlings. But du Maurier also put more of her own character into Mad than she realised. Westland suggested that du Maurier's motive in writing the book was to explore her own feelings about the Britain that her grandchildren would inherit. She hated the superior attitude of London, and the crass interventions from up-country. In the novel she tried to give Cornwall back to the Cornish and let them defend their own land.

Background The previous year was a good one for the undefeated Olympic Gold Medalist Ray Mercer. He started the year off by defeating the previously undefeated Francesco Damiani to capture the WBO Heavyweight title. Following that victory, Mercer was matched up against another undefeated fighter in Tommy Morrison for what would be the first and only defense of his WBO title. Morrison outboxed Mercer for the first three rounds, but Mercer came back strong in the fourth round and proceeded to knock out Morrison in brutal fashion by pinning him against a corner and landing several unanswered, heavy blows until the referee stopped the bout 28 seconds into the fifth round. The victory made Mercer one of the top fighters in the heavyweight division and he quickly vacated the then less regarded WBO title in order to face 42-year-old ex-heavyweight champion Larry Holmes in a match to determine who would next meet Evander Holyfield for the IBF, WBA and WBC versions of the Heavyweight Championship. Holmes had twice retired, first after failing to recapture his IBF title in a 1986 rematch with Michael Spinks, and then again after being dominated for four rounds in a 1988 fight with Mike Tyson for Tyson's undisputed title. In April 1991, Holmes launched a comebackLarry Holmes Starts Comeback On Sunday, Morning Call article, 1991-04-05, Retrieved on 2013-08-05 and he proceeded to defeat five unknowns through the course of the year before agreeing to face Mercer in February 1992. Holmes was given little chance to defeat Mercer and came into the fight as a 4–1 underdog. Mercer and his team looked at the fight as a \\"springboard\\" to gain Mercer more marketability. Holmes, however, remained confident that he could defeat Mercer and vowed that he would retire for the final time should he lose.Seeking Marquee Status, Mercer Set To Fight Holmes, Philadelphia Inquirer article, 1992-02-07, Retrieved on 2013-08-05 The Fight Through the early portion of the fight, Mercer and Holmes were both aggressive and traded punches, though Mercer was able to land his punches more effectively and at a higher frequency. Mercer continued to be the aggressor in the second round and spent most of the round on the attack. Towards the end of the round, Holmes stood with his back against one of the corners and was able to land a few right hands to Mercer's head while using that strategy. By the third round, Holmes had fully embraced the defensive strategy and continued to fight with his back against the ropes for the remainder of the fight. Mercer would continue to attack Holmes in the corner with several combinations, but Holmes would counter with some combinations of his own. In the fourth, Holmes would circle around Mercer in an effort to pace himself and not burn himself out by trading punches with the younger and stronger Mercer. Holmes then spent almost the entire fifth round with his back against the corner where he landed some good shots on Mercer, who by then seemed to have tired of Holmes unorthodox strategy and was not landing as much as he had in the earlier rounds. Mercer would continue to struggle with Holmes' defense for the rest of the fight and by the later rounds, was seemingly more fatigued then Holmes. The fight went the full 12 rounds with neither man picking up a knockdown. As such, the fight went to the scorecards, and with scores of 117–112, 117–111 and 115–113, Larry Holmes was declared the winner by unanimous decision.Holmes Defeats Mercer by Decision, N.Y.

However, unlike Mercer, Holyfield would not get fatigued and continued to attack Holmes for the duration of the fight. Holmes simply was unable to sustain much offense and lost by a relatively lopsided unanimous decision.It Wasn't Pretty, but Holyfield Still Retains Title, N.Y. Times article, 1992-06-20, Retrieved on 2013-08-05 Ray Mercer returned from his defeat to win his next two fights and eventually earned another chance at receiving a World title shot when he agreed to meet WBA/IBF champion Riddick Bowe. In what was supposed to be a tuneup before his title match with Bowe, Mercer fought journeyman Jesse Ferguson on February 6, 1993 on the undercard of the Riddick Bowe–Michael Dokes championship fight. However, Ferguson dominated Mercer, winning easily by unanimous decision, taking Mercer's title shot with Bowe in the process. Adding to Mercer's problems was the fact that after his loss, Ferguson revealed that Mercer had bribed him with $100,000 to take a dive knowing that he was well behind Ferguson on the scorecards and a loss would cost him his title shot.Mercer Charged With Offering Ferguson a Bribe During Bout, Philadelphia Inquirer article, 1993-06-30, Retrieved on 2013-08-05  References  Category:Boxing matches Category:1992 in boxing Category:Boxing in Atlantic City, New Jersey Category:1992 in sports in New Jersey Category:February 1992 sports events in the United States ","title":"Ray Mercer vs. Larry Holmes"},{"id":"40162470","text":"WMXR may refer to: * WMXR-LP, a low-power radio station (92.7 FM) licensed to serve Miami, Florida, United States * WJKS (FM), a radio station (104.3 FM) licensed to serve Keeseville, New York, United States, which held the call sign WMXR from 2012 to 2013 * WWOD, a radio station (93.9 FM) licensed to serve Woodstock, Vermont, United States, which held the call sign WMXR from 1988 to 2012 ","title":"WMXR"},{"id":"40162475","text":"Deh-e Pain-e Darb Kalat (, also Romanized as Deh-e Pā’īn-e Darb Kalāt; also known as Deh-e Pā’īn) is a village in Sadat Mahmudi Rural District, Pataveh District, Dana County, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran.

Built in 1790 by the state of New York, it was intended to be the executive mansion for President George Washington, but he never occupied it. Before it was completed, the federal government moved temporarily to Philadelphia; then permanently to Washington, D.C. It then became the state governor’s residence and was used by George Clinton and John Jay. Later it was leased to John Avery and was known as the Elysian Boarding House. After the passage of the Customs Administration Act in 1799, it was converted into the Custom House in New York. Parts of the building were later leased to the American Academy of Arts, who then offered space to the New-York Historical Society in 1809. In 1813, the property was sold to the city. In 1815, the land was sold to the public and the building demolished. Background After Evacuation Day, November 25, 1783, the site of Fort George was viewed as the \\"social center of New York\\", prime real estate for grand residences. From March 4, 1789, to December 5, 1790, the federal capital of the United States was in New York, at Federal Hall. President Washington first occupied the Samuel Osgood House - April 23, 1789, to February 23, 1790 - then the Alexander Macomb House - February 23 to August 30, 1790 - both private houses. On July 13, 1789, the New York State legislature passed a resolution that the site of Fort George should be used to build a \\"proper House ... for the residence and accommodation of the President of the United States.\\" History Government House in 1795 On March 16, 1790, the New York state legislature authorized the demolition of Fort George and the building of a government house for the \\"temporary use and accommodation of the President of the United States of America, during such time as the Congress of the United States shall hold their sessions in the city of New York.\\" On March 24, proposals for the building were requested. The architect, John McComb, Jr., submitted plans, but apparently they were not used, since they do not match the house as built. James Robinson was probably the architect. During the coming months, the fort defensive walls and enclosed buildings were taken down. Some stones were even reused to build the new government house. The cornerstone of this new building was laid on May 21, 1790. However, before the building was completed, Congress passed the Residence Act of July 16, 1790, which named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the permanent national capital was under construction at what is now Washington, D.C. Thus, President Washington never resided in this public building, intended to be his executive mansion. The Government House was described in 1791 by Rev. Garret Abeel as an \\"elegant two-story brick building of an oblong square form ... In front is an elegant pediment, supported by four large pillars ... all the rooms in the house command a most extensive and delightful prospect, some into the East River, some quite to the Narrows; others up the North River.\\" Portrait of George Clinton painted by John Trumbull in 1791 While the building was never used by the President, it did serve as the state governors' house. In 1791, Governor George Clinton moved into the building. Governor John Jay lived in the residence from 1795 to 1797. He was the last governor to live here, since Albany became the state capital in 1797. In May 1798, the state leased the building to John Avery. He then opened it as the Elysian Boarding and Lodging House. The Elysian has also been called a tavern. John Avery left two weeks after the building became the Custom House. The Custom House, 1799–1815 Alexander Hamilton inspired the Customs Administration Act, passed by Congress on March 2, 1799, “An act to regulate the collection of duties on imports and tonnage.” On May 1, 1799, the building was converted for use as the Custom House in New York. The Custom House had previously been at S. William Street, opposite Mill Lane, known as 5 Mill Street. Government House was the Custom House until 1815. The following year, the Custom House occupied a store at the site of the second City Hall on Wall Street. On April 11, 1808, the upper room of the building was reserved for the American Academy of Arts. The academy was previously known as the New York Academy of Fine Arts. In 1809, the academy invited the New-York Historical Society to use one room on the second floor for its collection. On May 26, 1812, the state legislature authorized the sale of the building and grounds to the city \\"for the erection of private buildings or other individual purposes.\\" The purchase was completed on August 2, 1813. On May 1, 1815, the city started the process to sell the property to the public. Seven lots facing Bowling Green were sold at auction on May 25. By June 1, the demolition of the building and clearing of the adjacent lots was underway. Legacy Commemorative tablet by the Holland Society of New York On September 29, 1890, the Holland Society of New York installed a commemorative tablet at 4 Bowling Green. It described that the Government House was built on the site of Fort Amsterdam, built in 1626. The site is now occupied by the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, built between 1902 and 1907. The historic Holland Society tablet was moved inside this new building.

The Hotel Alcron was constructed by its owner/architect Alois Krofta, a local businessman, and opened in 1932. Krofta named the hotel after himself, taking the first two letters of his first and last names and adding an \\"n\\" to match the Alcron, a boat from Greek mythology. Guests before the war included Charlie Chaplin and Winston Churchill, while Joachim von Ribbentrop and Karl Hermann Frank stayed in the hotel during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. In 1948, the Alcron was seized by the communist government. Following the fall of communism, the hotel closed in 1990 and the Krofta family filed claims for restitution in 1992. A legal battle ensued between two of Krofta's ex-wives and one of their daughters. The three women were eventually each given 1/3 ownership, which they each sold in 1995 to an Austrian-based firm, Crown WSF Ltd. In 1996, the new owners contracted Radisson SAS Hotels to manage the hotel upon its reopening. It was completely rebuilt and modernized at great expense, with the historic public rooms restored to their original Art Deco grandeur. It reopened on August 1, 1998 as the Radisson SAS Hotel Prague. Crown secured the right to use the Alcron name two years later, and the hotel was renamed Radisson SAS Alcron Hotel. The hotel was again renovated in 2008. It was again renamed Radisson Blu Alcron Hotel in 2009, when the Radisson SAS partnership ended.http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/tourism/?doc=9667 After 20 years of management by Radisson, the Alcron Hotel became independent and was renamed Alcron Hotel Prague on January 1, 2019. The Alcron hotel is home to two restaurants and one bar.

The stated aim of the offensive was to conquer al-Haffah city, but government supporters assumed conquering Mount Nabi Younes was more likely the real aim. A calculated side effect may have been to spark more sectarian violence in Syria by carrying out a sectarian attack on an Alawite-majority area. The offensive began in early August 2013. During the campaign, rebel forces captured a dozen villages. However, in mid-August, the military counter-attacked and recaptured all of the territory previously lost to the rebels. Offensive =Rebel advance= On 4 August 2013, an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 rebel fighters, 300 of them foreigners, launched an offensive from the rebel-held town of Salma further into the predominantly pro-government Alawite Latakia province. The offensive started with a rebel attack on 10 Alawite villages in the Jabal al-Akrad mountain area. Rebel tanks were also deployed, firing on the villages. Throughout the day, ambulances rushed wounded government fighters to Latakia city from the frontline. As for rebel casualties, Tunisians, Libyans, Saudis and Jordanians were among those reported killed in the initial attacks. In one instance during the fighting, a foreign rebel suicide-bomber detonated his car killing at least 15 NDF militiamen and Army soldiers. By the end of the first day of fighting, rebels had seized five villages and captured 400 Alawite villagers and pro-government militiamen, including a pro-government Alawite cleric, Badr Ghazal. Hundreds of Alawite civilians fled to Latakia. On 5 August 2013, rebels further advanced to the outskirts of the Alawite village of Aramo, 20 km from Qardaha, president Bashar al-Assad's hometown which also contains the mausoleum of Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad. Rebel forces were using freshly supplied anti- tank missiles to a reportedly devastating effect with one opposition activist claiming three Army tanks were destroyed on a hilltop overlooking Salma. Later, it was reported that opposition forces had captured Aramo, along with one other village. Rebels also made attempts to advance in the Jabal Turkman mountain area. However, during the second day of the fighting, government forces launched a counter-attack and managed to recapture one of the five villages they lost the previous day, Beit al-Shakuhi. The counter-attack came as fresh government reinforcements started to arrive in an attempt to push back the rebels. While the rebel offensive was praised by some of their sympathizers, others were opposed to opening up the front, with one opposition activist noting that the rebels \\"have a habit of escalating without preparing as soon as they feel they have enough weapons. But they are not ready... and the regime's response will be crazy.\\" The United States, a main backer of the FSA, was against targeting Latakia, because it could spark revenge attacks by Alawites against its majority Sunni population and increase the flow of refugees. Other foreign diplomats said the coastal area and its mountain villages could be the scene of a bloodbath against the Alawites if Islamist radicals end up eventually gaining the upper hand. On 6 August 2013, the opposition activist group the SOHR claimed that rebels had overrun 11 Alawite villages in the previous three days. A security source played down the report saying that only two villages were still rebel-held after an Army counter- attack. SOHR also reported that a number of executions had been conducted during the course of the offensive. Four hilltop military posts that were shelling rebel-held villages were also reportedly captured by opposition forces. On 7 August 2013, an Alawite cleric confirmed 13 villages were captured by rebel forces, but stated that six of them had already been recaptured by the Army the previous day. He also claimed that the rebels killed more than 100 people in sectarian massacres against the villagers, most of them women and children. Two days later, SOHR confirmed that dozens of Alawite civilians had been killed in the area. Other activists also reported 60 civilians had been killed in the offensive. On 9 August 2013, opposition activists reported that FSA commanders had issued orders to their battalions in the province to halt their advances and retreat from villages they had captured, the reason being that arms supplies to the rebels had been halted in the previous hours. However, senior FSA sources denied that a retreat order was issued. One opposition activist stated that rebel fighters actually rejected the FSA’s request to retreat, due to the arms shortage, and resorted to using the ammunition they seized from government forces during the fighting. Later during the day, the Syrian Army attacked three villages, with state media claiming the military managed to recapture all three. However, activists stated government forces managed to recapture one village, Qashba, while fighting was still ongoing in the other two. Rebel forces, in turn, claimed in an online video to had managed to capture the village of Kharratah, three kilometers south of Salma. However, the village had already been confirmed as captured by rebel forces at the start of the offensive days earlier. During the night, several air-strikes hit Salma killing 20 people. 10 of them were rebel fighters, including four foreigners, and 10 were civilians. By 11 August, reports emerged of mass civilian killings by rebel forces in the captured Alawite villages, as well as the abduction of hundreds of others. =Army counter-attack= On 16 August 2013, the military launched a counter- attack, reportedly quickly capturing two villages. On 18 August 2013, the Syrian Army claimed to have recaptured nine villages over the previous two days. An opposition activist confirmed that the rebels lost seven villages, but stated that they managed to once again capture five of them. Later, the SOHR acknowledged that the military made gains and recaptured several Alawite villages during the day. They added that the Army killed scores of foreign fighters, including a Libyan emir of the al-Qaeda-linked group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The air force bombarded rebel positions in the Jabal al-Akrad mountains, during which a fighter jet was reportedly shot down and its pilot captured by the rebels. On 19 August 2013, state media reported that the Army recaptured all rebel-held positions in Latakia after capturing the Nabi Ashia mountain range and adjoining areas in the north of the province. According to a security source, the only remaining rebel-held area was in and around the town of Salma, from which the rebels launched their offensive. Opposition activists confirmed the Army recaptured nine Alawite villages, but stated that fighting was still ongoing in two more. Government troops had also retaken all of the military observation posts which rebels seized at the start of their offensive. It was later confirmed that all of the villages had been recaptured by the military. =Rebel massacre of civilians= On 26 August 2013, the SOHR reported that the kidnapped Alawite cleric, Badr Ghazal, had been executed by the Al-Nusra Front. More than a month after the offensive had ended, additional reports emerged of civilian killings by rebel fighters. According to one report, two mass graves were found. Kidnapped women had also been shipped off in trucks to be raped by rebel fighters. 62–140 civilians were estimated to had been massacred, with another 105–199 missing or confirmed as kidnapped. On 11 October, Human Rights Watch released a report which stated that, after an investigation, they found grave violations of human rights by opposition forces, for example executions, unlawful killings, and hostage-taking. According to the report, 190 civilians were killed by rebel forces, including at least 67 of the victims being executed or unlawfully killed, although the number could be higher. Human Rights Watch stated that most of those killed were either intentionally or indiscriminately killed by opposition forces. More than 200 hostages, primarily women and children, continued to be held by Islamist forces. Human Rights Watch further stated, that two Kuwaiti nationals, Sheikh Hajjej al-Ajami and Shafi al-Ajami, apparently had a prominent role in collecting financial resources for the operation.HRW: Executions, Unlawful Killings, and Hostage Taking by Opposition Forces in Latakia Countryside See also *2014 Latakia offensive References External links *Documentary: The Decisive Battle: Lattakia Press TV documentary on Vimeo Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2013 Category:Latakia Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Persecution of Alawites Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the al-Nusra Front Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Free Syrian Army Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Ahrar al-Sham Category:Massacres of the Syrian Civil War in 2013 Category:Massacres of the Syrian Civil War perpetrated by ISIL Category:Massacres of the Syrian Civil War perpetrated by the al-Nusra Front Category:Massacres of the Syrian Civil War perpetrated by rebels Category:Battles involving the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ","title":"2013 Latakia offensive"},{"id":"40162663","text":"Mazeh Kaz (, also Romanized as Māzeh Kaz; also known as Māzeh Gar, Māzeh Gaz, and Māzgeh) is a village in Sadat Mahmudi Rural District, Pataveh District, Dana County, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran.

Early life and education Danny Rich was born in London, and attended Hearnville Primary School and Sir Walter St. John's Grammar School, where he was head boy. Following his A-levels in German, History, and Government and Politics, he worked for the London Fire Brigade before entering Manchester University to study Politics and Modern History, doing his undergraduate thesis on The Palestinian Experience in Jordan: 1948–1970 and maintaining an active role in student politics, being twice elected chairperson of Manchester University Students Union. During this time, he also served as a visiting lay minister for Leicester Progressive Jewish Congregation, and as a teacher/service leader at Manchester Reform Synagogue. In 1984, Rich began rabbinical training at Leo Baeck College, a privately funded rabbinical seminary in the UK for Liberal and Reform rabbis. While there, he continued to serve at Leicester Progressive Jewish Congregation, and began teaching at North Western Reform Synagogue (Alyth Gardens). He served as an assistant to Rabbi Julia Neuberger at South London Liberal Synagogue, as part-time minister to Kingston Liberal Synagogue, and as student rabbi to Hull and South Hampshire Reform communities, before returning to serve as the full-time Rabbi at Kingston in 1988, where he was ordained in 1989. Kingston Liberal Synagogue and public service As Kingston Liberal Synagogue's first full-time rabbi, Rich served until 2004, when he was appointed emeritus rabbi. During his period of service at Kingston, he co- founded and chaired the Kingston Interfaith Forum, a group to promote communication and understanding between the faith groups in the borough. He also served as the director of Kadimah Summer Camp from 1990–2005. In 1996, he was appointed as a Justice of the Peace (magistrate) in the Kingston Court, presiding over cases until the court's closure in 2011, when he presided over the court's last trial. Rabbi Rich also serves as a prison, hospital and hospice chaplain. He is currently Jewish chaplain to Her Majesty's Prison Coldingley, and formerly to the open prison Latchmere House until the prison's closure in 2011, as well as for Kingston Hospital, and Oaklands National Health Service (NHS) Trust. He also served as Jewish mental health chaplain to Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. As a part of his involvement as a prison chaplain, he received a diploma in criminology from the Scarman Centre for the Study of Public Order (Leicester University) in 2001. He is a former Trustee of Mental Aid Projects a former Governor at Hinchley Wood Junior School. Liberal Judaism In 2004, Rich was named as the chief executive of Liberal Judaism, a progressive Jewish movement founded in the UK in the early part of the 20th century. Rabbi Rich was preceded in this role by Harriet Karsh, who had assumed the role from her predecessor, Rabbi Dr. Charles Middleburgh. Prior to this appointment, Rich had served as the chair of the Rabbinic Conference of Liberal Judaism, a board composed of all the Rabbis serving Liberal synagogues in the UK that meets regularly to discuss and rule on rabbinic matters, determining courses of action or principles of faith. He is on the board of governors at Leo Baeck College, where he had served previously as the director of the college's Apprenticeship, Internship and Mentoring Program. A regular in the media, Danny makes frequent appearances on the BBC, Sky TV, ITV and in Jewish and national press. =Interfaith affiliations= Many of Rich's affiliations reflect a position of the promotion of interfaith understanding. He is the UK regional representative for the World Union for Progressive Judaism (WUPJ). He also holds a Certificate in Jewish/Muslim relations from the Woolf Institute, Cambridge. He is an organiser and frequent contributor to Scriptural Reasoning, an organisation that promotes shared scriptural readings between Jews, Christians, Muslims and members of other faiths. He is one of the presidents of the Council of Christians and Jews, He is a co-founder of the Surrey Three Faiths Forum, and in 2011 became a founding member of the Council of Imams and Rabbis. = The JFS case= In 2009, a case was brought before the High Court where a 12-year-old boy, referred to in the case as M, was denied entry to the Jewish Free School (JFS) because, although his father was born a Jew and both his father and mother actively practised the Jewish faith, the mother had converted to Judaism in a non-Orthodox synagogue, failing to meet the school's criteria for the child being Jewish. As a spokesperson for Liberal Judaism (which recognizes patrilineal as well as matrilineal Jewish descent), Rich was actively vocal in supporting M's case, stating that JFS, as a state-funded school, had an obligation to be open to all forms of Judaism. The school was found to be in violation of the Race Relations Act, and is now required to admit its students on the basis of Jewish faith, rather than by the maternal blood line. Following the court's decision, Danny Rich, along with Liberal Judaism chairman Lucian J. Hudson, issued a statement in The Jewish Chronicle in support of the ruling, stating that JFS had \\"risked the Jewish community being portrayed as more concerned with petty, territorial squabbles than providing the best of Jewish education to the widest number of Jews\\". =Same-sex marriages= Rich is a vocal proponent in favour of legalising same-sex unions. In 2005, Liberal Judaism under the direction of Rich became the first mainstream religious movement in the UK to publish an official liturgy for same-sex commitment ceremonies. In February 2013, Rich presented evidence to the House of Commons Public Bill Committee looking into the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, reiterating Liberal Judaism's stance on the issue, stating that \\"although Liberal Judaism respects the right of other religious movements to decline to conduct marriages which go against their teachings, and to have this right protected in law, it also seeks, in the name of freedom of religion, the right to conduct marriages which it sees as legitimate, and as an important pastoral service to its members.\\" =Considered Engagement controversy= In January 2012, Rabbi Rich drew criticism for sharing a debate panel with an anti-Israel activist. He stood by his decision to do so, citing Liberal Judaism's policy of Considered Engagement, a policy where the movement's chief executive, chairman and other national officers review invitations to participate in events based on their goals, even if the hosting or participating organisation are not in accord with the policies of Liberal Judaism. =The confirmation of Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis= When Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis was named Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth in December 2012, Rich issued a statement welcoming his appointment, but said that the hardest part of the job would be recognising that the position \\"no longer represents a large section of the community\\". =Expanded religious education in the UK school system= In October 2013, A Curriculum Framework for Religious Education in England was issued by the Religious Education Council of England and Wales, stating is part that, \\"All children need to acquire core knowledge and understanding of the beliefs and practices of the religions and worldviews which not only shape their history and culture but which guide their own development.\\" Rich wrote a column in Haaretz in support of the publication, calling for comprehensive religious education in both single-faith and secular schools, stating that \\"religious education has never been more important\\". =The \\"pickling\\" of Judaism by the Charedi= The 2012 statistics report for Britain's Jewish Community, issued in November 2013 by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, noted a \\"natural increase\\" in Britain's Jewish population, with specific mention of Britain's Charedi (Orthodox) community, who were responsible for four out of every ten Jewish births and more than three in ten weddings. In response to these numbers, Rich issued remarks that have generated some controversy, stating that the Orthodox community \\"pickled\\" Jewish tradition rather than preserving it, by refusing to engage with the outside world. =The admission of Syrian refugees into the UK= In January 2014, Rich took part in a delegation of rabbis who delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street, calling on the government to allow Syrian refugees into the UK. He issued a statement that read in part, \\"For Jews, Jewish teaching demands that we find ways of alleviating the suffering and in the name of our faith we call on the British government to allow Syrian refugees into the UK.\\" Publications * \\"Liberal Judaism and Mixed Marriage\\" in David J.

Beliefs An important element is the belief in the soul (psa) of the ancestors, who have the ability to observe and evaluate the affairs of their offspring. The concept of physical pain or pleasure in the Hereafter (Hedryhe) is absent: the soul is granted spiritual satisfaction or remorse for one's chosen path in life in front of himself and his ancestors. Therefore, the goal of man's earthly existence is the perfection of the soul, which corresponds to the maintenance of honour (nape), manifestation of compassion (guschlegu), gratuitous help (psape), which, along with valour, and bravery of a warrior, enables the human soul to join the soul of the ancestors with a clear conscience (nape huzhkle). The souls of the ancestors require commemoration: funeral feasts are arranged (hedeus) and sacrifice or memorial meal preparations (zheryme) are practiced and distributed for the remembrance of the dead souls.

First of all, Tha expresses himself generating the Word or cosmic Law (Khy), the primordial pattern from which all the beings form naturally, developing by internal laws. Enlightenment for men corresponds to an understanding of Tha's Law. − Thashkhue is omnipresent in his creation (coagulation); according to Adyghe cosmological texts, \\"his spirit is scattered throughout space\\". In Adyghe hymns Tha (Thashxue) is referred to as \\"the One everyone asks, but who doesn't ask back\\", \\"the multiplier of the non-existent\\", \\"on whom everyone places their hope, but who doesn’t place hope on anyone\\", \\"from whom the gifts come\\", \\"His amazing work\\", \\"the One who permits heaven and earth to move\\". Everything is One (Псори Зыщ, Psora Zysch, or Псори Хыщ, Psora Hysch), and is one with the Tha. The material-manifested world is in perpetual change, but at the same time there is a foundation that always remains unshaken. That is the originating principle of the world and its Law. The always-changing world and its basis is compared to a rotating wheel (дунейр шэрхъщи duneyr sherhschi, мэкlэрахъуэ meklerahue): although the wheel is constantly rotating (changing), it has its central hub around which it revolves, which remains still.

He served as the Chief Justice of the Washington Supreme Court from 1933-1935 and from 1945-1946. Early life and education Watler B. Beals was born July 21, 1876, in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was the son of James Burrill and Katherine (McMillan) Beals and a descendant of Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island Colony. His family also included a chief justice of Rhode Island's supreme court, a chief justice of Minnesota's high court, and a senator from that state. Beals attended public schools in St. Paul, graduating from high school in 1895. He began law studies under an attorney's supervision, but ill health prompted his move to Bellingham, Washington. Within a year he became strong enough to work in a saw mill as a shingle weaver. In 1899, he entered the first class at the University of Washington School of Law (a classmate of Walter M. French and Vivian Carkeek), graduating with a bachelor of laws degree (LL.B.) in 1901. Legal and military career Harold L. Sebring, Walter B. Beals, Johnson T. Crawford, and Victor C. Swearingen. Beals' first law practice was in partnership with Fred Rice Power. Upon the latter's death, Beals continued to practice in Seattle.

He entered the U.S. Army in August 1917, serving in the judge advocate's division. Beals spent sixteen months in France and saw action in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive with American expeditionary forces. Promoted to lieutenant colonel and decorated with the Legion of Honour by France, he became one of the founders of the American Legion. Fluent in French, he remained in Europe for several months after the armistice as a liaison officer with the French government. Returning to Washington, Beals announced his intention to run for the state Supreme Court. In the September primary he failed to unseat any of the three incumbents, falling short by more than 30,000 votes. During his career, Beals served as Seattle Corporate Counsel (1923-1926), a King County Superior Court judge (1926-1928), a Washington State Supreme Court judge and Chief Justice. He retired in 1951.

Early years Middleton attended Western Hills High School, where he played as a running back and linebacker. In his senior season, he posted 1,620 rushing yards and 20 touchdowns, including a 250-yard, 6-touchdown game against Walnut Hills. He received All- conference and All-southwest Ohio honors. In his last 2 years he registered 2,742 yards and 35 touchdowns. He also practiced track and field. College career Middleton accepted a football scholarship from Indiana University with the plan of being the eventual successor at running back to Anthony Thompson. A chronic injury to his right ankle that he suffered in the Ohio All-Star game, forced the team to redshirt him in his first season. As a freshman, because of his size and athletic ability, the coaching staff wanted to find a way to get him on the field and converted him into a cornerback, although his body type was considered heavy for the position. As the starter at left cornerback he made 59 tackles (fourth on the team), 5 tackles for loss, 2 sacks, one interception and one pass defensed. As a sophomore, he experienced a muscle spasm in the walls of his heart and missed 2 games. He finished the season with a career-high 65 tackles, 6 tackles for loss, 4 passes defensed and one interception. In the season opener he returned an interception 22-yards for a touchdown against the University of Kentucky. He had a career-high 15 tackles against Michigan State University. He also added 8 kickoffs returns for 169 yards (21.1-yard average). As a junior, he had 63 tackles (fourth on the team), 4 tackles for loss and 7 passes defensed (tied for the team lead). In his last year, he was diagnosed with mononucleosis, which forced him to miss the first 2 games. He still was able to post 58 tackles (fourth on the team), 3 tackles for loss, 3 passes defensed and one forced fumble. He put together a string of double-digit tackle performances over the final three games of the season. He also practiced track and field as a senior.

Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), often shortened to Mt. Healthy v. Doyle, was a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision arising from a fired teacher's lawsuit against his former employer, the Mount Healthy City Schools. The Court considered three issues: whether federal-question jurisdiction existed in the case, whether the Eleventh Amendment barred federal lawsuits against school districts, and whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments prevented the district, as a government agency, from firing or otherwise disciplining an employee for constitutionally protected speech on a matter of public concern where the same action might have taken place for other, unprotected activities. Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion. The case was first heard in the Southern District of Ohio. In 1971, Fred Doyle, who had been teaching social studies for five years in the Mount Healthy City Schools, learned his contract had not been renewed, not only denying him tenure but any further employment with the district. The superintendent's letter cited both an incident where he had made an obscene gesture to students and his sharing of a district dress code for teachers with a local radio station as displaying a \\"lack of tact\\". He took a position with another district and filed suit under Section 1983, arguing his constitutional rights to free speech had been violated, per the Court's 1967 decision in Pickering v. Board of Education, another case involving an untenured teacher fired for speaking out in the media. After the district court ruled in his favor, the school district appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which partially vacated the decision in a brief per curiam opinion late in 1975. The Supreme Court took the case and heard oral argument almost a year later. It handed down its decision early in 1977. On the jurisdictional question, Rehnquist held that although the school district had been created by state law, it was primarily a local entity and thus beyond the reach of the Eleventh Amendment, its first ruling in that area in 86 years.Harwood, Anthony J.; \\"A Narrow Eleventh Amendment Immunity for Political Subdivisions: Reconciling The Arm of the State Doctrine with Federalist Principles\\"; 55 Fordham L. Rev 101, 105 (1986). Retrieved February 5, 2014. The Court did not, however, decide the question of whether Doyle had been fired legally, since there were other incidents suggesting he had difficulties in his relationships with students and fellow teachers which the district had introduced into the record. Instead, it remanded the case to the district court, ordering it to require the district to show by a preponderance of evidence that Doyle would have been fired regardless if he had not contacted the radio station. The school district was later able to do so, and in 1982 the Sixth Circuit upheld that decision. The case introduced what has since become known as the \\"Mt. Healthy test\\" into similar cases that follow the Pickering line in asserting the First Amendment rights of public employees where the employer claims other, unprotected conduct motivated the adverse action, a two-prong process that shifts the burden of proof from plaintiff to defendant in the course of the action. First, the plaintiff must prove that the activity they were allegedly disciplined for was indeed protected speech. The defendant must then show by a preponderance that the adverse action would have occurred if the protected activity had never happened. This has been criticized as allowing public employers a way to circumvent restrictions on taking adverse action against whistleblowers, and more generally as incompatible with the underlying principles of tort law. The test has also been expanded into mixed motive discrimination cases in employment law. Underlying dispute Doyle had begun teaching in Mt. Healthy, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati, in 1966. His one-year contract with the school system was renewed three times; in 1969 the contract term was extended to two years. Were it to be renewed, Doyle also expected to be granted tenure and commit to teaching at Mt. Healthy for the long term.Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, , Rehnquist, J. During the 1970 school year, he served as president of the school's Teachers' Association, and worked to expand the subjects of negotiations between it and the school board. The following year he was on the association's executive board. During this time relations between the association and the board were reportedly very tense, and Doyle was at the center of several incidents during 1970. As the Court recounted them: In February 1971 the principal circulated a memo to all employees outlining a new dress code, apparently motivated by the administration's belief that public support for the district's bond issues was in part motivated by the teachers' appearance. Doyle, as an association official, had been aware that the administration was considering such a measure but had been led to believe that the association would have had some input before it was announced. He thus shared the memo with a friend at Cincinnati radio station WSAI, which used it as the basis for an on-air news item.Mt. Healthy at 283. Doyle later apologized to the principal, saying he should have expressed his concerns over the administration's handling of the issue privately before making the memo public. A month later the district's superintendent made his annual recommendations to the board on whether to renew the contracts of untenured faculty. Doyle was one of nine whom he did not recommend rehiring, and the board accepted the recommendations and voted not to renew the contracts, denying Doyle tenure and terminating his employment with the Mt. Healthy schools. Doyle asked for a reason he had not been rehired, and later received a short written note. The board cited his \\"notable lack of tact in handling professional matters which leaves much doubt as to your sincerity in establishing good school relationships.\\" It pointed to two specific instances of this: his obscene gesture to the girls in the cafeteria and his leaking of the dress-code memo which \\"raised much concern not only within this community, but also in neighboring communities.\\"Mt. Healthy at 283n1. Lower courts Shortly after the school year ended Doyle accepted another teaching position, for less pay but with tenure, at Miami Trace High School, midway between Cincinnati and Columbus. He and two of the other fired teachers brought suit in federal court for the Southern District of Ohio, seeking reinstatement, back pay and $50,000 in punitive damages for violations of their civil rights under Section 1983. They named as defendants the board as a governmental entity, its members and the superintendent individually in their official and personal capacities. Judge Timothy Sylvester Hogan heard the case. The school district's defenses were primarily procedural, in particular challenging whether federal courts had the jurisdiction over it in this case. Doyle relied on the Court's 1968 Pickering v. Board of Education decision, in which it unanimously held in favor of an untenured Illinois teacher fired for writing a letter skeptical of a school tax increase to a local newspaper, to assert his First Amendment rights against similar retaliatory action by the Mt. Healthy board. That case, however, had been appealed to the Supreme Court from the Illinois Supreme Court, having originated in that state's courts.Pickering v. Board of Education, . For two reasons, the school district claimed, there was no federal jurisdiction. First, as an \\"arm of the state\\", under the Eleventh Amendment, it was entitled to the same sovereign immunity since Ohio law did not consent to litigation against school districts for violations of constitutional rights. Second; Since Doyle had taken another job so soon after his dismissal, his lost wages were minimal and thus the amount in controversy was less than the $10,000 required for federal jurisdiction.Mt. Healthy, 276–280. It raised two other defenses that addressed Doyle's substantive claims. In 1972's Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, the Court had held that an untenured professor did not have a due process claim over the nonrenewal of his contract (as opposed to a dismissal prior to the expiration of the contract term) without a property or liberty interest at stake.Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, . Therefore, the district argued, neither did Doyle. And even if he did, his history of misconduct and intemperate outbursts was sufficient justification for his termination. Hogan ruled in Doyle's favor on every issue; although he dismissed the case against the board members as individual defendants. The statute creating school districts had effectively waived any Eleventh Amendment protection. And since Doyle had filed his suit under the section of the law that creates federal-question jurisdiction, limitations such as the amount in controversy did not apply. He felt Pickering gave him no leeway to decide whether Doyle would have been fired without leaking the memo, an act which he found had played \\"a substantial role\\" in the board's decision.Mt. Healthy, 284–286. Doyle was to be reinstated and reimbursed over $5,000 in back pay plus $6,000 in attorney's fees. The district appealed the verdict to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In late 1975, the appellate court affirmed all of Hogan's decisionDoyle v. Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education, 529 F.2d 524 (6th Cir., 1975) save for attorney's fees, which per the Supreme Court's recent decision in Alyeska Pipeline Co. v. Wilderness SocietyAlyeska Pipeline Co. v. Wilderness Society, it believed were not a permissible award in the case. The district petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari, and it was granted early the following year. Before the Court In their reply brief, the school board raised the issue of whether or nor the district itself was a \\"person\\" that could be sued under Section 1983. At trial, Hogan had ruled that since the case had been filed under the statute allowing for federal-question jurisdiction, it was properly a 1983 case as well and was not subject to any limitations of that statute. In a string of cases brought against local governments dating to 1961's Monroe v. Pape, it had held that they were not \\"persons\\" and could not be sued under 1983.Monroe v. Pape, Three years earlier, in a case similar to Doyle's, a district court in Colorado had held that school districts were not persons under those precedents, and it was this case the district relied on.Weathers v. West Yuma County School District, 387 F.Supp. 552 (D.Colo., 1974) Oral argument was scheduled for late in 1976. Philip Olinger, the school district's lawyer, argued their case. Michael Gottesman appeared for Doyle. =Argument for board= No sooner had Olinger finished his review of the facts of the case when Justice William Rehnquist began questioning him about the nature of school districts in Ohio, using Rehnquist's native Arizona as a point of comparison. Were the boards named as defendants in lawsuits? Who paid verdicts against them? Were they provided for by the state constitution? What was their authority to tax and how much money did the state contribute to them? In his native Virginia, Justice Lewis Powell noted, school board members were \\"constitutional officers.\\" Olinger told him that was as far as he knew not the case in Ohio. When he was able to turn to the specifics of the case, Olinger reminded the justices that Hogan had agreed that, other than Doyle's contact with WSAI, the board had ample reason not to renew his contract. The rest of the argument focused on the jurisdictional issues. Olinger said that the difference between Doyle's salaries at Mt. Healthy and Miami Trace was too small to reach the $10,000 threshold. Pressed by one of the justices, he admitted that he was not taking into account the difference it might have made over the course of several years of employment; however he said it was entirely possible that Doyle's potential top salary step at his new school would be higher than it might be at Mt. Healthy. Olinger explained to the court that language in Ohio's 1912 constitution allowing the legislature to pass laws under which the state could be sued had, shortly after its adoption, raised the question among the state's legal community of whether Ohio had, by doing so, surrendered its sovereign immunity. After a series of cases on this question, the Ohio Supreme Court had held in 1922, following the Court's Hans v. Louisiana decision,Hans v. Louisiana, that if the state were to do so, it would have to be by a specific act of the legislature.Aldrich v. Youngstown, 106 Ohio St. 342, 140 N.E. 164, 27 A.L.R. 1497 He dismissed Doyle's suggestion that the Court, as it had done with the Fourth Amendment in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents,Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, find an implied cause of action in the Fourteenth Amendment that would allow lawsuits regardless of any statutory provision. Lastly, he reminded the justices that, when Section 1983 was adopted, Congress rejected an amendment explicitly allowing for actions against states and local governments. =Argument for Doyle= While he understood the jurisdictional issue was most important to them and planned to discuss it first, Gottesman told the justices, he hoped to spend some time on the facts of the case. He conceded that the implied cause of action he saw was not necessary to establish jurisdiction. Rather, it had been a response to the school district's late argument that it was not a person under Section 1983, and that he should have cross-appealed Hogan's ruling, in which he dismissed the case against the individual members as defendants, but did not because he did not expect that issue to arise again. But he begged the Court's indulgence because under Kenosha v. Bruno, another one of the cases following Monroe, if the school district had the same Eleventh Amendment immunity as a municipality Doyle could not seek equitable relief such as his reinstatement against the board as an entity;Kenosha v. Bruno, he would have had to do it against the members personally. If the case were remanded in its present state, he said, he would be unable to proceed even if he won on all the other issues. Since Congress had changed the federal-question statute since Bivens, he felt that created the implied cause of action from the enabling language in the Fourteenth Amendment. \\"It may be the most important civil rights question this court is going to in the next decade\\", Gottesman reminded the justices. \\"The lower courts are deciding this issue by the legions.\\" Nevertheless, he allowed that they might want to wait for a case where the issue was briefed by both parties. Having devoted most of his time to the jurisdictional arguments, he asked for some time to speak about the merits near the end. \\"If we only knew what the school board would have done but for the phone call [to WSAI],\\" Gottesman suggested, \\"we know how to ... deal with this case.\\" The Court should follow precedent from civil-rights and labor law and put the burden of proving that on the defendant. Otherwise, \\"every school board that wants to fire someone for a First Amendment reason, well ... no teacher can teach for five years without doing something somebody would find objectionable. Even though their motivation is solely the First Amendment reason, they'll tack on two or three other reasons.\\" At a justice's prompting, he likened it to the harmless error rule in appellate review. Opinion of the Court Two months later, early in 1977, the Court handed down its decision. The justices had unanimously ruled in Doyle's favor on all the jurisdictional questions. And on the merits, they said, the school district would have to prove that it would have fired him for reasons unrelated to his leaking the memo to the radio station.Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, Justice William Rehnquist wrote for the Court. First, he said, the amount in controversy did not defeat Doyle's claim to jurisdiction since \\"[e]ven if the District Court had chosen to award only compensatory damages and not reinstatement, it was far from a 'legal certainty' at the time of suit that Doyle would not have been entitled to more than $10,000. \\"Rehnquist agreed with Gottesman that the possibility of an implied cause of action in the Fourteenth Amendment was an important question, yet \\"one that should not be decided on this record.\\" Since Doyle had made the suggestion in response to the board's late resurrection of its claim to non-personhood, Rehnquist dealt with that. Had the board properly preserved the issue, he noted, the Court would have been obliged to decide it. But it had not, and since Doyle's claim to federal-question jurisdiction seemed like a legitimate constitutional issue and not one claimed for the sole purpose of obtaining federal jurisdiction, \\"we leave those questions for another day, and assume, without deciding, that the respondent could sue under § 1331 without regard to the limitations imposed by 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\\"A year later, in Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, , the Court took up that question and decided that municipalities were persons under Section 1983, overruling Monroe v. Pape. The Court had chosen a different approach to the Eleventh Amendment question. Rather than agree with Hogan that Ohio had waived sovereign immunity for its school districts through the statute that had created them, \\"we prefer to address instead the question of whether such an entity had any Eleventh Amendment immunity in the first place, since if we conclude that it had none it will be unnecessary to reach the question of waiver,\\" Rehnquist wrote. Ohio law itself was very clear—the state did not include local \\"political subdivisions\\" and the school district was a political subdivision. While it received guidance and some money from the state Department of Education, it was one of many local school districts in the state and had broad authority to levy property taxes and issue bonds financed by those tax revenues. \\"On balance, the record before us indicates that a local school board such as petitioner is more like a county or city than it is like an arm of the state ... it was not entitled to assert any Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in the federal courts.\\" Rehnquist then turned to the merits of the case. After recounting in some detail Doyle's history of intemperate behavior in his years at Mt. Healthy and the contact with the radio station, he rejected the board's argument that Roth barred Doyle's claim since he did not have tenure. Instead he followed Roth's companion case, Perry v. Sindermann, another case Gottesman had argued, with distinct similarities to Doyle's. In Perry, a Texas public junior college professor who had, like Doyle, been president of a faculty organization that clashed with the administration, challenged the nonrenewal of his contract.Perry v. Sindermann, In contrast to Roth, the Court had ruled that he had alleged enough facts to make an arguable case that the nonrenewal was retaliatory action for his speech on a matter of public concern, and so it would for Doyle. Lastly Rehnquist considered Hogan's admission that while he read Pickering as mandating that Doyle be reinstated with tenure and back pay for the board's violation of his constitutional rights, there were certainly other reasons the board could have cited to justify the firing that were not constitutionally actionable. Since under state law the board did not even have to show cause for the nonrenewal, \\"it is not clear what the District Court meant by this latter statement.\\" The only \\"plausible\\" meaning Rehnquist could divine was that the board could have fired Doyle anyway even if he had never called the radio station. In that case, Rehnquist went on, it would not necessarily have been a constitutional violation for an adverse action to have resulted even significantly from protected activity. The Court did not want to leave that reading in place, since it would allow a misbehaving employee to insulate themselves from adverse action by engaging in protected conduct. It was, Rehnquist wrote, necessary to establish a test for future such cases. He looked to other areas of the law to formulate one. In two prior criminal cases, Lyons v. OklahomaLyons v. Oklahoma, and Parker v. North CarolinaParker v. North Carolina, the Court had allowed the use of later confessions or statements by defendants even where earlier ones had been coercively obtained as long as the later statements appeared otherwise voluntarily given. \\"While the type of causation on which the taint cases turn may differ somewhat from that which we apply here, those cases do suggest that the proper test to apply in the present context is one which likewise protects against the invasion of constitutional rights without commanding undesirable consequences not necessary to the assurance of those rights.\\" Since Doyle had met his burden of showing that one of the actions for which the board terminated him was constitutionally protected speech, \\"the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent's re-employment even in the absence of the protected conduct.\\" The Court could not determine this from the available record, so it vacated the Sixth Circuit and remanded the case to District Court to facilitate that inquiry.Mt. Healthy, 286–87 Subsequent proceedings On remand, Hogan did as the Supreme Court ordered. He concluded that \\"the Board has established by a preponderance of the evidence that Doyle would not have been renewed because of the incidents—exclusive of the radio incident—which had occurred during the year or so prior to the nonrenewal\\" and ruled in its favor. Doyle appealed this finding of fact to the Sixth Circuit.Doyle v. Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education, 670 F.2d 59 (6th Cir., 1982) A panel composed of the circuit's chief judge at the time, George Clifton Edwards, Jr., Albert J. Engel, Jr. and senior judge John Weld Peck II heard arguments in late 1981. A little over a month later, four years and two days after the Supreme Court's decision in the case, they issued a brief per curiam opinion that largely recounted the history of the case to that point. \\"We read this record as disclosing that while appellant Doyle had some fine qualities as a teacher, he also had a very quick temper,\\" they wrote. \\"[W]e cannot find that the district judge's finding of fact on remand is clearly erroneous.\\" They affirmed his decision. Subsequent jurisprudence Later cases that rely on Mt. Healthy have largely concerned the eponymous test derived from the case. The Supreme Court expanded its application to other areas of the law, for now leaving it to the appeals courts to wrestle with the specifics. =Supreme Court= Two years later, the Court was able to reinforce the \\"Mt. Healthy test\\" in another, very similar case. Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District came on appeal from the Fifth Circuit, which had upheld the firing of a Mississippi teacher for, in part, her regular and vehement complaints to her principal about the racially disparate impact of school-district policies in the wake of court-ordered desegregation. The appeals court distinguished the case from Pickering and Mt. Healthy by noting that her complaints, despite involving a matter of public concern, had been made privately.Ayers v. Western Line Consolidated School District, 555 F.2d 1309 (5th Cir., 1977) Rehnquist, again writing for a unanimous court, held that the context of the speech made no difference under the First Amendment; it was as protected as Pickering's letter and Doyle's telephone call. The Fifth Circuit, writing before the Supreme Court had decided Mt. Healthy, had been in much the same position with regards to the factual record with regards to the Supreme Court in Mt. Healthy. \\"while the District Court found that petitioner's 'criticism' was the 'primary' reason for the School District's failure to rehire her, it did not find that she would have been rehired but for her criticism.\\" It remanded the case to the district court again to resolve that issue;Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, unlike Doyle, Givhan ultimately triumphed. Over the course of the 1980s the Court would extend the test to claims alleging other improper adverse employment action in the private sector as well. In National Labor Relations Board v. Transportation Management Co., it unanimously endorsed the board's use of the test in upholding its ruling in favor of a bus-company employee alleging he was fired for his attempts to organize a union, contrary to the other reasons claimed by the company.National Labor Relations Board v. Transportation Management Co., Two years later, Rehnquist again wrote for a unanimous Court that, Mt. Healthy \\"suppl[ies] the proper analysis\\" in 1985's Hunter v. Underwood, finding Alabama's felony disenfranchisement laws were primarily meant to target black voters even if they also affected poor whites.Hunter v. Underwood, , , Rehnquist, J. The Court extended the Mt. Healthy test to private-sector mixed motive discrimination claims in 1989 with Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins. There, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote for a plurality that clarified the language it had used in Givhan: \\"A court that finds for a plaintiff under this standard has effectively concluded that an illegitimate motive was a 'but-for' cause of the employment decision.\\"Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, , , Brennan, J. The decision's imposition of a shift in the burden of proof from plaintiff to defendant once the former has proved that an improper reason motivated the adverse action was criticized in Anthony Kennedy's dissent as only narrowly applicable to such cases.Hopkins, at 272–295, Kennedy, J., dissenting. \\"The burden shift properly will be found to apply in only a limited number of employment discrimination cases. The application of the new scheme, furthermore, will make a difference only in a smaller subset of cases,\\" at 290–91. =Appeals courts= By 1992 the Fifth Circuit could assert that \\"the two-step burden-shifting rule ... has now become standard fare in discrimination cases\\" in the third and final appeal by a Mississippi newspaper alleging that local government withdrew legal advertising in retaliation for critical coverage.North Mississippi Communications, Inc. v. Jones, 951 F.2d 652 (5th Cir., 1992) The district court had found the first-ever application of the test to a case involving denial of public patronage \\"strained\\"; Judge John Robert Brown disagreed, saying it was\\" broad enough potentially to lend itself to a wide variety of fact patterns\\" and remanded the case.Jones, at 654. In a pair of cases, the Seventh Circuit has dealt with how and when to instruct a jury that is given the Mt. Healthy test to apply. In Greenberg v. Kmetko it directed a district court to change its instruction to more closely match the test should the case be heard by a jury, even though it had granted qualified immunity to the defendants.Greenberg v. Kmetko 840 F.2d 467, 475 (7th Cir., 1988) Frank Easterbrook observed in 1992's Gooden v. Neal, where a correctional officer alleged he had been demoted in retaliation for exposing corruption, that \\"[m]any defendants do not want Mt. Healthy instructions and prefer to ask an either-or question of the jury\\" since they also contend the activity the adverse action was in retaliation for was not protected by the First Amendment. \\"Mt. Healthy is something of a misfit in such circumstances.\\" In that case, where the employer denied that the plaintiff's speech was in any way related to the adverse decision, they chose to shift the burden of proof of that to the employer as well,Gooden v. Neal, 17 F.3d 925, 929 (7th Cir., 1994) an approach Donald P. Lay of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation, criticized at length in dissent.Gooden at 930–934 In 2002, the Ninth Circuit held that the test still applies when a plaintiff presents only a circumstantial case that the adverse action was retaliatory as opposed to a direct one.Allen v. Iranon, 283 F.3d 1070, 1074–1079 (9th Cir., 2002) \\"In the aftermath of Mt. Healthy,\\" wrote Sandra Lynch for the First Circuit in 2004, \\"confusion still sometimes arises about the issue of causation.\\"Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121, 130 (1st Cir., 2004) She was writing in one of several cases it heard in the mid-2000s arising from alleged political retaliation in Puerto Rico, where members of the New Progressive Party (NPP) brought suit claiming that members of the rival Popular Democratic Party (PDP) had improperly forced them out of government jobs after the PDP defeated the incumbent NPP in the commonwealth's 2000 elections. Many of them involved the correctness of jury instructions on the subject. Since the employer's defense largely rested on the illegality of personnel moves by the outgoing NPP so that its members could keep their jobs, Lynch elaborated: Since the jury instructions had not included a direct question as to whether they found that the defendants would have taken the same action without the political consideration, the First Circuit overturned the jury's finding for the plaintiffs and remanded the case for retrial with a proper jury instruction.Sanchez-Lopez, 136–38. In Tejada-Batista v. Morales, where a discharged Puerto Rico Special Investigations Bureau agent alleged retaliation by a superior for his contact with a local newspaper, then-Chief Judge Michael Boudin denied defendants' request that a Mt. Healthy instruction be allowed, as it was \\"not on point\\" since he did not feel they had introduced enough evidence to support a claim that there were permissible reasons to take adverse action.Tejada-Batista v. Morales, 424 F.3d 97, 102 (1st Cir., 2005) Gene Carter dissented, arguing that the verdict should have been reversed since the evidence suggested one of the named defendants had no knowledge of anything but the domestic violence charge that was the stated reason Tejada had been fired.Tejada-Batista, 103-109. Judge Juan R. Torruella, in Rodriguez- Marin v. Rivera-Gonzalez, another of the political cases, characterized the Mt. Healthy test as an affirmative defense.Rodriguez-Marin v. Rivera-Gonzalez, 438 F.3d 72, 81 (1st. Cir., 2006) In that case, not only did the court find that it was insufficient for the defendants to merely introduce evidence that would be sufficient for a jury to find that they had other reasons to take action against the plaintiffs, they had to show that a reasonable jury could have found for them. Similarly, the court held that a jury instruction that a finding that the plaintiffs' political affiliations and activities were the \\"determinative factor\\" in the defendants' actions against them met the test's requirements.Rodriguez-Marin at 83. In 2011, the Second Circuit affirmed a successful use of the Mt. Healthy defense in a case where it had found one constitutionally protected speech act was a motivation for the adverse action. The plaintiff in Anemone v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority was the former head of security for the agency, who claimed his attempts to root out corruption in the agency had been ignored or frustrated by his superiors. At one point he had discussed it with a reporter from The New York Times, which eventually published a story about the allegations.Anemone v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 629 F.3d 97 (2nd Cir., 2011) Judge Debra Ann Livingston wrote for a panel that took two years to decide the case. It found that while that act was constitutionally protected, the balancing test established by Pickering v. Board of Education actually improved the MTA's case under Mt. Healthy, since although it was speech on a matter of public concern it was disruptive to the MTA's operations since it breached the confidentiality the plaintiff was required to maintain about security matters and internal investigations as part of his job duties. Even if it had not been so disruptive, the court held, his record of insubordination and deception of several of the defendants was enough reason for him to have been disciplined and fired—indeed he had even admitted he believed his job to be in jeopardy before he had contacted the Times. Analysis and commentary Three years after the decision, E. Gordon Gee, then a professor at West Virginia University College of Law, described it as a turning point in First Amendment jurisprudence. He anticipated the later efforts of the First and Seventh circuits in working out how to implement the Mt. Healthy test: \\"The major effect of Mt. Healthy will be felt, and struggled with, in the trial courts. [It] provides little guidance ... on the amount and type of evidence required of the plaintiff to shift the burden of proof to the defendant.\\"Gee, 267. Some tort-law specialists have been very critical of the burden-shifting test. Georgia law professor Michael L. Wells finds it at odds with the fundamental principles of tort law and thus wrongly decided. \\"It should be replaced by a rule that allows the plaintiff to recover full damages when the constitutional violation was sufficient to cause them.\\" The Court, he wrote in 2000, could have found other causation tests in tort law that were fairer to the plaintiff than but-for, such as suffi.Michael L. Wells. \\"Three Arguments against Mt. Healthy: Tort Theory, Constitutional Torts, and Freedom of Speech\\" Mercer Law Review 51.2 (2000): 583-601, 585. Retrieved February 9, 2014. \\"It is especially ill-suited to constitutional torts charging retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights\\" since it ensures that an employee who speaks out on a matter of public concern will have to consider the possibility that his or her employer will find some plausible reasons for taking action against him apart from his protected speech or other activity.Wells, 596–598. Sheldon Nahmod of Chicago-Kent College of Law shares Wells's criticism. He points to one case in particular where the Court seemed to recognize the theory that constitutional violations should always be grounds for liability regardless of whatever other issues exist. In Carey v. Phipus, decided a year after Mt. Healthy, the Court held that two students challenging their suspensions were entitled to prove that their due process rights were violated as they alleged even if the suspensions themselves turned out to have been factually justified.Carey v. Phipus, While not a constitutional claim, he also looks to 1995's McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., a case under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, where an age discrimination verdict against a private employer was upheld even though the respondent had concededly met the Mt. Healthy burden with evidence of her wrongdoing because that evidence was discovered subsequent to the employee's termination.McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., .Hahmod, Sheldon; \\"Mt. Healthy and Causation-in-Fact: The Court Still Doesn't Get It!\\", 51 Mercer Law Review 603–619, 2000. Retrieved February 9, 2014. Other commentators have focused on the Eleventh Amendment aspects. New York lawyer Anthony J. Harwood reads the decision as establishing, along with the 1979 case Lake County Estates v. Tahoe Regional Planning Board,Lake County Estates Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Board, a test to determine when a political subdivision is not an arm of the state and thus does not enjoy the state's sovereign immunity. Despite the existence of this test, however, he notes that lower courts have generally followed Lincoln County v. Luning,Lincoln County v. Luning, . the last case before Mt. Healthy to pose an Eleventh Amendment question to the Court regarding state political subdivisions, regardless of whether the case invokes federal-question or diversity jurisdiction. \\"This practice is contrary to the balance of state and federal interests that inheres in the Supreme Court's Eleventh Amendment doctrine.\\"Harwood, 118.

It is one of the principal peaks of the Palmertown Range. There are two lakes on the mountain, Lake Bonita and Lake Anna, which were previously used for fishing. History The mountain was originally called Palmertown Mountain, named by a band of Native Americans who moved to the area from Massachusetts escaping from the aftermath of King Philip's War. It was renamed after Duncan McGregor purchased it for back taxes and built a hotel called the Mountain House in 1876. Hotel Balmoral In 1881 McGregor sold the mountain to the Saratoga, Mount McGregor and Lake George Railroad, owned by Joseph William Drexel. Drexel constructed a narrow-gauge railroad from Saratoga Springs and built the Hotel Balmoral at the summit with accommodation for 300 guests. In 1897 the hotel burned to the ground. In 1885 Drexel loaned his friend, seriously ill former president Ulysses S. Grant, the use of his personal cottage on the mountain. Here Grant spent the last six weeks of his life struggling to finish his memoirs before he died. The cottage, preserved exactly as it was at his death, is now the Grant Cottage State Historic Site and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Mount McGregor Sanitarium The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company purchased the 1,200 acres of Mt. McGregor to build a tuberculosis sanitarium for up to 350 patients, eventually comprising 30 buildings costing around $3 million. The sanitarium opened in 1914. In 1945 New York State purchased the facility from Metropolitan for convalescing veterans of World War II. With the decline in the need for veterans' services the facility was converted for use of the developmentally disabled, and in 1976 converted again to a prison, the Mount McGregor Correctional Facility. In 2013 Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to close the prison. The Mount McGregor Correctional Facility officially closed in July 2014. Grant Cottage State Historic Site continues to operate, but access to the area is restricted to Historic Site visitors during operating hours only. Over 700 acres of former corrections property was transferred to Moreau Lake State Park and there are new trails that access the new Lake Bonita parcel. The 325 acre former Correctional Facility property is open to redevelopment proposals.
