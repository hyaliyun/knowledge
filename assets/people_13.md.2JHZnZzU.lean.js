He was part of a dynasty of apothecaries in Kronberg im Taunus. Neubronner was court apothecary to Kaiserin Friedrich, invented the pigeon photographer method for aerial photography, was one of the first film amateurs in Germany, and founded a factory for adhesive tapes. After his death, the company was directed for 70 years by his son Carl Neubronner (13 January 1896 – 19 November 1997).  Father and grandfather  The Neubronner family was resident in Kronberg as an apothecaries' family since Christian Neubronner had taken over a pharmacy there in 1808. In 1844 the pharmacy passed to his son Sohn Wilhelm Georg Neubronner (1813–1894),Deutsches Biographisches Archiv. Georg Hirth: Hirth's Parlaments-Almanach. Fünfte Ausgabe. 1867, S. 79. a longtime friend of painter Anton Burger and father of Julius Neubronner.Anton Burger 1824-1905: Ausstellung in der Streitkirche Kronberg, kronberger- maler.de. During the Revolution of 1848 he directed the local militia.Märzrevolution in Kronberg 1848 , kronberg.de. The wife of Wilhelm Neubronner and mother of Julius Neubronner came from the Löwe dynasty of actors, and her sister was the singer Sophie Löwe.  Adolescence  Julius Neubronner 1877 while studying in Gießen From adolescence, Julius Neubronner was a passionate amateur photographer. In 1865 he found a camera for the Talbot system which his father had built on his own shortly after the invention of photography. All experiments with the obsolete camera failed, and together with a friend the boy secretly bought another camera on credit.Neubronner, Julius (1920), 55 Jahre Liebhaberphotograph. Neubronner initially received his education at home, together with two sisters. His godfather Julius Löwe operated a chemical laboratory in Frankfurt, and from 1864 the now twelve-year-old boy attended the Gymnasium in that city. After three years he changed to Weilburg, where he received the mittlere Reife. After a year of apprenticeship in his father's pharmacy he attended the Royal Realgymnasium in Wiesbaden. He fulfilled his military duties at least partially in the Province of Hanover. In 1873 he finished his apprenticeship as apothecary's assistant in a pharmacy in Berlin, followed by three practical years in pharmacies in Bendorf, Frankfurt, Hannoversch-Münden and Nyon. In Nyon he got into contact with stereoscopy. From 1876, Neubronner studied pharmacy in Gießen, where he joined the Akademisch-Naturwissenschaftlicher Verein (now a Burschenschaft).Verzeichniß der Mitglieder des acad.naturw. Vereins zu Giessen, Nr. 46. Shortly after his pharmaceutical examination in 1877, he began to study chemistry in Berlin in 1878, but soon switched to Heidelberg, where he received his doctorate in 1879.Hans Jürgen Schultz: Apotheker, Erfinder und Fabrikant: Hofapotheker Dr. phil.

S. 101–104.  Pharmacy and factory  Streitkirche in Kronberg with pharmacyIn 1886, Julius Neubronner took over the pharmacy in Kronberg from his father. In 1887 he bought an important historical building known as Streitkirche ('dispute church'). Planned as a catholic church in the Protestant town of Kronberg, but never inaugurated, it had been the object of a notable conflict.Die Kronberger Streitkirche , hr- online.de.Chronik, hofapothekekronberg.de. After the necessary modifications (the building had previously been used as an inn), family and pharmacy could move into the building in 1891. When Emperor Frederick III died in the Year of the Three Emperors 1888 after only 99 days in office, his widow Victoria, Princess Royal, known in Germany as Kaiserin Friedrich, had Schloss Friedrichshof constructed as her new residence in the forest near Kronberg. Neubronner now obtained the rank of a court apothecary.Einblicke in das Leben der Kaiserin, Kronberger Bote 14/2001. Wilhelm Neubronner had used pigeon post for fast delivery of prescriptions, but had stopped the practice after a few years, when the neighbouring villages received their own pharmacies. Inspired by a newspaper report in 1902 that described a similar practice of an apothecary in Boston and showed a lack of awareness with his father's achievements, Julius Neubronner took up and expanded the practice. By pigeon post he obtained urgent chemicals up to from his wholesaler in Frankfurt and delivered urgent medication to the sanatorium in Falkenstein (Königstein im Taunus) The notable sanatorium, founded in 1876 by Peter Dettweiler, was replaced by a recreation home for officers between 1907 und 1909.Kempinski Hotel Falkenstein feiert kaiserliches Jubiläum, Kronberger Bote 6/2009. Between 1903 and 1920 Neubronner recorded a number of amateur films which were restored by the Deutsches Filmmuseum between 1994 and 1996 and later published on YouTube.Schobert, Walter (November 1996), Early amateur films by Julius Neubronner: restored , Journal of Film Preservation 53, S. 47–48.Filme von Neubronner. filmarchives-online.de. The cumbersome process of gluing glass photographs for laterna magica presentations inspired him to invent a form of adhesive paper tape, which he patented. For production and marketing he founded the Fabrik für Trockenklebematerial in 1905. Under the name Neubronner GmbH & Co. KG it still exists and has around 80 employees.Firmengeschichte der Neubronner GmbH & Co. KG. neubronner.com.  Private life and pigeon photography  Stadtmuseum Kronberg In 1886, Julius Neubronner married Charlotte Stiebel (1865–1924). Her father Fritz Stiebel (1824–1902) was a well-known physician in Frankfurt.Otto Winckelmann: Fritz Stiebel: Ratschläge für praktische Ärzte. Hessisches Ärzteblatt 2/2002. S. 108. Her maternal grandfather was Jacques Reiss (1807–1887), patron and honorary citizen of Kronberg and main initiator of the Cronberger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (Kronberg Railway Society).Teutonia und Alemannia. www.kronberg.de.Magistratsmitglieder gedachten Ehrenbürger Carl Neubronner, Kronberger Bote 3/2006. Jacques Reiss , kronberg.de.Stadt gedachte Geburtstag Neubronners, Kronberger Bote 3/2004. Like his father, Julius Neubronner was a friend and sponsor of a Kronberg-based group of notable painters known as Kronberger Malerkolonie, whose museum is now located on the first floor of his house.Ausstellungseröffnung in der Streitkirche. kronberger-maler.de. In 1907, he joined the Senckenberg Nature Research SocietyDirektion der Senckenbergischen Naturforschenden Gesellschaft: Bericht der Senckenbergischen Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Frankfurt am Main 1908. In 1907, Neubronner submitted a patent for his invention of aerial photography by means of a pigeon photographer; he was granted the patent in 1908. The invention brought him international notability after he presented it to an interested audience at international expositions in Dresden, Frankfurt and Paris in 1909–1911.. Spectators in Dresden could watch the arrival of the camera-equipped carrier pigeons, and the photos were immediately developed and turned into postcards which could be purchased. At the 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows he received two gold medals, for the method and for the photographs. The invention was tried out for military air surveillance in the First World War and later, but apart from honourable mentions in encyclopedias (Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, Brockhaus Enzyklopädie) it only caused him expenses.  Successors  After Julius Neubronner's death in 1932, the pharmacy stayed in the Neubronner family for two more generations. First it was managed by Wilhelm Neubronner, who wrote a book about Ice stock sport and was generally active in local and national sports. With his death in 1972, his son Kurt-Heinz Neubronner took over the pharmacy, but in 1995 it was sold.Kronberger Bote. The factory was taken over by Julius Neubronner's youngest son Carl Neubronner (13 January 1896 – 19 November 1997), who managed it for 70 years. In 1957 he received the Federal Cross of Merit (1st class), in 1966 he made the staff share the company's profits, and he was active in an industry association. Carl Neubronner became known for his experiments with model aircraft: At the age of 16 he developed the \\"Raketoplan\\", a rocket-propelled model airplane, and the national rocket model aircraft club still awards an annual Carl Neubronner Prize. Verpackungsrundschau 12/97. 100 Jahre Carl Neubronner, RAMOG. In 1984 he became honorary citizen of Kronberg. Since 1987 the Carl Neubronner Sports Foundation supports sports in Kronberg. Carl Neubronner was married to Erika Neubronner (1923–2005). In April 1997 they founded the socially oriented Carl and Erika Neubronner Foundation.

History  Formed in 1992 by Bruce Ellery for his son's racing ambitions, Steven Ellery Racing was a team that lasted over a decade in Australian racing. The team ran Formula Ford a Van Diemen in 1992, expanding to a second car in 1993 for Garry Gosatti. The team moved into the Australian Super Touring Championship in 1994 with an ex Glenn Seton Racing Ford Sierra, before upgrading to a Tony Longhurst Racing BMW 318i in 1995. The team disbanded at the end of 1995 as Ellery moved into V8 Supercar racing for other teams. V8 Supercar The team only ever ran a single car for Steven Ellery in the main V8 Supercar championship, although it did expand to a second car for Luke Youlden to race in the V8 Supercar Development Series. In 1999 the team raced an ex Stone Brothers Racing Ford EL Falcon using the number #31. In 2000 the team started to use a Ford AU Falcon and brought in Supercheap Auto as naming rights sponsor and continued to use the car and until the start of the 2003 championship when they upgraded to a BA Falcon. The team finished just out of the top ten in most seasons, and Ellery paired with Youlden took third Place at the 2003 Bathurst 1000. In the middle of the Gold Coast round of 2004 Supercheap Auto left the team. The team ran the final two rounds of the season with sponsorship from Chelgrave Contracting, the sponsor which the team had run in 1999 as well as during its Super Touring appearances. At the end of 2004, the team closed its doors as Ellery moved to Team Betta Electrical for the 2005 season. The team would contest the 2005 Holden Performance Driving Centre V8 Supercar Series with two Ford BA Falcon’s for New Zealander Mark Porter and former V8 Utes driver Gary MacDonald before leaving the sport altogether.

Early life Ola Gorie was born in Kirkwall, Orkney. Her mother was Minnie Gorie, her father Patrick Gorie; together her parents ran a long-established grocers and wine merchants, Kirkness & Gorie, in central Kirkwall. Despite growing up in a commercial environment, Ola decided to pursue an artistic career, and attended Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen, leaving in 1960 as the first graduate of its jewellery department. A craft movement is reborn Ola Gorie returned to Orkney where three jewellery shops in Kirkwall agreed to sell her designs. When she took over her own shop, success came quickly. Her early designs, the first to be originated in Orkney since Viking times,The Orkney Guide Book, Charles Tait (Kirkwall, 2005) drew heavily on Orkney's Norse heritage, featuring images such as the Maes Howe Dragon, inspired by Viking graffiti in a Neolithic tomb. Her jewellery found quick acceptance both locally and, by the end of the sixties, across the country.Crafts of the Highlands and Islands, John Manners (London, 1978) Appreciation of it grew as part of the wider craft movement in Britain in general, and the Scottish Highlands in particular. Her work drew inspiration from Orkney's Norse, Pictish, Scottish and Celtic heritage and also from natural forms, and art history. Commissions for one-off pieces came from the Queen Mother, Liberty of London, the British Museum and the House of Commons. By the time of her retirement from business, in 1997, Ola Gorie employed as many as 55 staff, and her jewellery was exported around the world. The business is now run, on a smaller scale, by Ola Gorie's daughter, textile designer Ingrid Tait, and operates out of the same premises the family business has occupied since 1859. Recognition In 1999, Ola Gorie was awarded an MBE in recognition of her services to the jewellery industry.The Orcadian Book of the 20th Century (Kirkwall, 2000)< Other awards include winner of the Scottish Gift of the Year in 1997 (shortlisted in 1998, 1999 and 2003) and runner up in 2000's Kayman Award. She lives in Orkney, and is involved in many artistic activities. Retrospective exhibition In November 2010, the Orkney Museum launched a retrospective exhibition, 'Celebrating 50 Years of Ola Gorie'.Orkney Islands Council. Accessed 28 July 2013 It ran to the end of January 2011 and confirms her importance in contemporary Orcadian culture. The exhibition brought together many of her early and iconic designs, along with designs sketches, the tools of her craft and original artefacts from the museum's collection which had inspired her, including a 2nd-century AD brooch. Another ancient piece of jewellery, the Westness Brooch, was found in a Viking boat burial on the Orkney isle of Rousay. However, her jewellery extends far beyond the Orkney influence: she was an early admirer of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and helped revive his style. The natural world of seaweed, thistles and pearls have a place in the collection too. Among the cabinets of wax moulds, account books and relics of a career was a letter from Margaret Thatcher who admired a ring.

Later on, mineral springs were discovered and were used as restorative baths by the French soldiers. In 1784, the Baron de Laborie, the French Governor of St Lucia, sent samples of the water to Paris for testing and it is believed to be good for rheumatism and skin complaints. In the wars following the French Revolution, the baths fell into disuse and it was not until the 1930s when Andre duBoulay, the owner of Soufrière and Diamond Estates restored the baths for his private use. When his daughter Joan Devaux took over the management of the estate in 1983, she opened it up to the public seeing the tourism potential of the estate. The Diamond Botanical Gardens (also known as the St. Lucia Botanical Gardens) is a area planted within the estate and includes Diamond Falls. There is a river running through the estate called Diamond River, it is black through the volcanic mud and there are mineral deposits on the river's banks. There are also nature trails as well as a watermill constructed in 1765. It was originally built to crush sugar cane, but more recently it was used to provide hydroelectric power for Soufrière.

Intuitively, in the simplified two and three dimensional case, the joint distribution forms an ellipse and an ellipsoid, respectively, in iso-density plots. In statistics, the normal distribution is used in classical multivariate analysis, while elliptical distributions are used in generalized multivariate analysis, for the study of symmetric distributions with tails that are heavy, like the multivariate t-distribution, or light (in comparison with the normal distribution). Some statistical methods that were originally motivated by the study of the normal distribution have good performance for general elliptical distributions (with finite variance), particularly for spherical distributions (which are defined below). Elliptical distributions are also used in robust statistics to evaluate proposed multivariate-statistical procedures. Definition Elliptical distributions are defined in terms of the characteristic function of probability theory. A random vector X on a Euclidean space has an elliptical distribution if its characteristic function \\\\phi satisfies the following functional equation (for every column-vector t) :\\\\phi_{X-\\\\mu}(t) = \\\\psi(t' \\\\Sigma t) for some location parameter \\\\mu, some nonnegative-definite matrix \\\\Sigma and some scalar function \\\\psi. The definition of elliptical distributions for real random- vectors has been extended to accommodate random vectors in Euclidean spaces over the field of complex numbers, so facilitating applications in time-series analysis. Computational methods are available for generating pseudo-random vectors from elliptical distributions, for use in Monte Carlo simulations for example.: , \\"an admirably lucid discussion\\" according to . Some elliptical distributions are alternatively defined in terms of their density functions. An elliptical distribution with a density function f has the form: :f(x)= k \\\\cdot g((x-\\\\mu)'\\\\Sigma^{-1}(x-\\\\mu)) where k is the normalizing constant, x is an n-dimensional random vector with median vector \\\\mu (which is also the mean vector if the latter exists), and \\\\Sigma is a positive definite matrix which is proportional to the covariance matrix if the latter exists.Frahm, G., Junker, M., & Szimayer, A. (2003). Elliptical copulas: Applicability and limitations. Statistics & Probability Letters, 63(3), 275–286. Examples Examples include the following multivariate probability distributions: * Multivariate normal distribution * Multivariate t-distribution * Symmetric multivariate stable distribution * Symmetric multivariate Laplace distribution * Multivariate logistic distribution * Multivariate symmetric general hyperbolic distribution Properties In the 2-dimensional case, if the density exists, each iso-density locus (the set of x1,x2 pairs all giving a particular value of f(x)) is an ellipse or a union of ellipses (hence the name elliptical distribution). More generally, for arbitrary n, the iso-density loci are unions of ellipsoids. All these ellipsoids or ellipses have the common center μ and are scaled copies (homothets) of each other. The multivariate normal distribution is the special case in which g(z)=e^{-z/2}. While the multivariate normal is unbounded (each element of x can take on arbitrarily large positive or negative values with non-zero probability, because e^{-z/2}>0 for all non-negative z), in general elliptical distributions can be bounded or unbounded—such a distribution is bounded if g(z)=0 for all z greater than some value. There exist elliptical distributions that have undefined mean, such as the Cauchy distribution (even in the univariate case). Because the variable x enters the density function quadratically, all elliptical distributions are symmetric about \\\\mu. If two subsets of a jointly elliptical random vector are uncorrelated, then if their means exist they are mean independent of each other (the mean of each subvector conditional on the value of the other subvector equals the unconditional mean). If random vector X is elliptically distributed, then so is DX for any matrix D with full row rank. Thus any linear combination of the components of X is elliptical (though not necessarily with the same elliptical distribution), and any subset of X is elliptical. Applications Elliptical distributions are used in statistics and in economics. In mathematical economics, elliptical distributions have been used to describe portfolios in mathematical finance.(Chamberlain 1983; Owen and Rabinovitch 1983) Statistics: Generalized multivariate analysis In statistics, the multivariate normal distribution (of Gauss) is used in classical multivariate analysis, in which most methods for estimation and hypothesis-testing are motivated for the normal distribution. In contrast to classical multivariate analysis, generalized multivariate analysis refers to research on elliptical distributions without the restriction of normality. For suitable elliptical distributions, some classical methods continue to have good properties. Under finite-variance assumptions, an extension of Cochran's theorem (on the distribution of quadratic forms) holds. =Spherical distribution= An elliptical distribution with a zero mean and variance in the form \\\\alpha I where I is the identity-matrix is called a spherical distribution. For spherical distributions, classical results on parameter-estimation and hypothesis-testing hold have been extended. Similar results hold for linear models, and indeed also for complicated models ( especially for the growth curve model). The analysis of multivariate models uses multilinear algebra (particularly Kronecker products and vectorization) and matrix calculus. =Robust statistics: Asymptotics= Another use of elliptical distributions is in robust statistics, in which researchers examine how statistical procedures perform on the class of elliptical distributions, to gain insight into the procedures' performance on even more general problems, for example by using the limiting theory of statistics (\\"asymptotics\\"). Economics and finance Elliptical distributions are important in portfolio theory because, if the returns on all assets available for portfolio formation are jointly elliptically distributed, then all portfolios can be characterized completely by their location and scale - that is, any two portfolios with identical location and scale of portfolio return have identical distributions of portfolio return. Various features of portfolio analysis, including mutual fund separation theorems and the Capital Asset Pricing Model, hold for all elliptical distributions.

Its two families, the Bathyteuthidae and Chtenopterygidae, each containing a single genus, have previously been included with the oegopsids. As with the oegopsids, the Bathyteuthoidea lack corneal membranes covering their eyes, something common to myopsid squid, and have paired oviducts, lacking in myopsids. As with the myopsids, bathyteuthoids have tentacle pockets in the head and small suckers on the buccal supports, found only in this group, Loliginidae, and Sepiidae; neither is found in true oegopsids. The Bathyteuthoidea do share the open ocean pelagic habitat with the oegopsid squid, uniting them in that way with that diverse group.

Background In early 1989, David Rindos, an archaeologist by qualification, was hired to fill a vacancy in the university's Department of Archaeology. Rindos commenced work on 13 June 1989. In 1990, the head of department, Dr Sandra Bowdler, took study leave. Bowdler was the Foundation Professor of Archaeology. Rindos became acting head of department in her place. Rindos later said that during his time as acting head, he was made aware of problems in the department, including favouritism and affairs between students and staff members. In December 1990, Rindos wrote a memo to Professor Charles Oxnard, then-head of Agriculture and Science, detailing the allegations of academic misconduct against Bowdler. In June 1992, Rindos' three-year probation period was complete and a decision on tenure was due. In May, the Vice-Chancellor, Fay Gale, had extended the review period by six months after having received a memo from Dr Michael Partis, the new head of department. A Tenure Review Committee was formed as a result. After an hour of deliberation, the committee unanimously decided to deny tenure. In July 1992 the Department of Archaeology was dissolved. On 10 June 1993, Rindos was dismissed, effective 13 June. In early 1996, the university's Senate announced an inquiry into the denial of tenure to Rindos. The terms of reference of the inquiry did not extend to investigating the allegations of misconduct against Bowdler. The Western Australian Legislative Council investigated the denial of tenure to Rindos. Their report was delivered in December 1997. David Rindos died in 1996.

He reached the rank of post-captain and served as the Royal Commissioner for English Harbour in Antigua. Biography He was born c. 1722. He was married to Mary Moutray on 2 September 1771. He was promoted to post-captain on 28 December 1758. On 29 July 1780 a convoy of 63 ships were bound for the East Indies and West Indies. They left Great Britain under the care of Captain John Moutray in the 74-gun , and accompanied by the 36-gun frigates and . On 8 August 1780 unusual sails were seen, and Moutray signalled his ships to alter course and follow him close to the wind. They paid no attention to his orders, and by daylight on 8 August 1780 a combined Franco-Spanish fleet had captured the bulk of the convoy. The warships escaped with eight of the convoy; the other 55 merchantmen were captured, with the loss of their cargoes worth a million and a half, and 2,805 prisoners. It was a blow to British commerce, and especially to the forces in the West Indies, which lost a vast quantity of military stores. The merchants at home were so enraged, Captain Moutray had to be made a scapegoat. He was tried by court-martial, which dismissed him from his ship. However, before long he was again employed. He went on to become the Commissioner of the naval dockyard in the Leeward Islands from April 1784 until 1785, where he became friends with Cuthbert Collingwood and Horatio Nelson. He died on 22 November 1785 in Bath, Somerset at the age of 62. He was buried at Bath Abbey four days later. He left his estate to his wife and children. His will also refers to two children he had by a woman named Elspeth London.

It was available for download on the iPhone, iPod touch and the iPad on the App Store or iTunes, and attracted many users since its release in March 2010. Although a free app, customers were able to buy in- app purchases; as of April 2010, it was the highest-grossing free-to-download game for the iOS. Within weeks of release, We Rule was estimated to have been downloaded millions of times, with approximately two million user sessions per day. Its gameplay was in part inspired by the Zynga game FarmVille.Chris Morrison, \\"Ngmoco’s We Rule Is Gaining Fast — Is the iPhone Having Its FarmVille Moment?\\", Inside Social Games, 2010-04-01. Accessed 2010-04-19. On February 1, 2013, We Rule was removed from the Appstore alongside other ngmoco games. The app continued to receive support until March 31, 2013 when its service ended and We Rule became unplayable.ngmoco, \\"Important Service Announcement for We Rule, GodFinger, Touch Pets Cats & Touch Pets Dogs 2\\", ngmoco:) Blog, 2013-01-25. Accessed 2013-02-17. Unlike some ngmoco games which continued to function after support ended, We Rule no longer functions. Gameplay In We Rule, players rule and have complete control over their Kingdom. Players begin with a tutorial, which eventually ends when the player has completed certain objectives. When beginning, players mainly profit from farming. Later in the game (but still in the tutorial) players can build houses and shops. Shops serve as the reason for needing a Plus+ account to play (any player can sign up right away after downloading We Rule). When one player has a shop that has already been constructed and opened, another player (who must be friends on We Rule with that person) can make an order for some items from their shop. Houses have a smaller impact on the game. When purchasing a house, players have to pay 100 Coins for each house, and can then collect taxes from each house every five minutes. The tax collected is ten Coins. Coins and Mojo play a very critical part in the game. Coins are the money used in We Rule, while Mojo can be used to instantly complete in-game tasks (growing crops, finishing building construction, and making a friend's order ready). Players can purchase Mojo using real money for various prices and quantities. Mojo can also be obtained as players level up, which is done by earning XP (experience points) by collecting crops and coins, completing objectives, and placing buildings. Players can decorate their Kingdom with many trees and other accessories. Besides shops, many other interesting buildings are available. Updates With an early 2010 content update, We Rule's level system allowed players to reach level 30 from the former 25. With this update the game's creators disabled power-leveling items such as Magic Cauliflower- and Asparagus, but added several rewards: the Ruby Citadel (available at level 30), Ruby Groves (level 26), Stocks (level 15) and Prison (level 15). A subsequent update shortly after the expansion to 30 levels reinstated Magic Cauliflower and Asparagus. On June 19, 2010, Ngmoco Inc. released a podcast discussing a new update which would allow the player to have several plots of land, known as realms, each gained or purchased at levels 15, 20, 25, and 30, as well as bug fixes. On June 26, Apple finalized the update and released it as We Rule 1.1. On October 26, 2010, Apple finalized another major update. We Rule becomes We Rule: Quests, which enables players to take up optional quests that yield various rewards. These quests require the player to make use of their Plus+ friends and order specific items from them, thus completing the quest once the other party has completed the order and sent it. Quest rewards come in the form of Experience points, Coins, or special decorations, which you can only obtain through completing quests. Within the same time span of the We Rule: Quests update, the maximum level players can achieve increased to 45 from the previous 40. Along with the new level cap, new crops were also introduced. As of August 2011, We Rule was updated weekly by Ngmoco. Players could achieve up to level 65, and special items, including \\"magic farms\\" and a gift system, were added. We Rule: Quests was later abandoned, and was replaced by the Goals system in the We Rule Deluxe version of the game. As of September 2012, We Rule ceased regular updates. The highest level achievable was 80. We Rule support ended completely on March 31, 2013. Players could not access their kingdom or play after that date. Criticism The We Rule interface. In We Rule, many players complain about slow loading time and problems involving connections and servers. In late March, We Rule had major server trouble, affecting a lot of players. ngmoco apologized for this trouble, by giving every player ten free Mojo. In June 2010 for half a week, when players tried to log in they received an error message noting that \\"plus+ is experiencing heavy load. Please try again later.\\" This time players were given 5 free Mojo, as their crops and orders were spoiled by the time they could log back into \\"We Rule\\". We Rule now has been phased out as a supported product.

The A13 highway from Isiolo to Mandera passes through Habaswein; it is located on the stretch from Modogashe to Wajir. The Town is much better than the county headquarters of Wajir and has better environment, reliable and clean water sources. It was fast rising before the County Government denied it resources and sidelined the development of the area. The First County Government of Wajir denied the city and its inhabitants their rights. It was discriminated against. The Habaswein hospital almost closed during this time with no drugs. A Pallasite stony-iron meteorite named Sericho was found near Habaswein in 2019. Etymology The name Habeswein derives from the , meaning big dust. The town is right next to the plains of the seasonal Ewaso Nyiro River. During the dry spell and in the winter winds, large fumes of dust covers the town. This is due to the fact that there is few vegetation coverage in and around the town. The town lies on the border between Wajir South Constituency and Wajir West Constituency; the road passing through the town forms the border. It has lakes, seasonal rivers/streams and agricultural valleys. The lakes are: Lake Bor, Lake Bissike, Lake Bogol, Lake Duup, Waratiris (stream), Abakfin, Ibrahim Ure, Shuub waraba, Cinjir, Lake Dima, Qote, Shimbirey and Quarintil.

It is on the Karatina town- Karatina University (Kagochi Road), approximately 5 kilometers from Karatina Town (CBD) and roughly 130 kilometers from Nairobi city. Ihwagi is known to have one of the nicest weather in Karatina compared to other regions. This may be due to the fact that it is located on the slopes of Mt. Kenya.

As a result, most of the local citizens are subsistence farmers and small business owners. Due to the subtropical climate, the area is known to have plenty of rain which often causes the Ragati river to flood. However, the most damage caused by the river is the destruction of crops. This being said, farmers and Ihwagi's locals have developed various ways to deal with the floods. Mt. Kenya snow capped peak, the second highest point in Africa can be seen from here.

It has over 100,000 members.Learn more about Shepherds Friendly History The Industrial Revolution led to major changes in society, with village communities diminishing and new towns and industries springing up. As there was no state provision for the poor, mutual aid organisations known as friendly societies were established to help families against hardship brought about illness or death. Such societies began as locally based groups, whose members contributed a small amount each month so that payouts could be made to those in need, with the rest of the money received either saved or invested. Shepherds Friendly started life as a sickness and benefits society, Ashton Unity, which was formed in Ashton-under- Lyne, Lancashire on Christmas Day in 1826. It was later renamed as the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds, \\"loyal\\" referring to the Crown and \\"shepherds\\" to the Nativity of Jesus. Its objects were \\"to relieve the sick, bury the dead, and assist each other in all cases of unavoidable distress, so far as in our power lies, and for the promotion of peace and goodwill towards the human race\\". It later spread across the country, organised into local branches; like other friendly societies such as the Oddfellows, these were known as 'lodges', and officers wore regalia somewhat similar to those of freemasons. By 1914 the membership had grown to 143,000. The Ancient Shepherds raised substantial funds from its members to support charities, presenting two lifeboats to the RNLI in the 1800s, and supported the Red Cross and YMCA in the Second World War.Friendly societies , Scottish Records AssociationVictoria Solt-Dennis, Discovering Friendly and Fraternal Societies, Shire Publications, 2005. . Pages 124-130 Various similar mutual associations have since amalgamated with it, including the Royal Shepherds Sanctuary Benefit Society which was established in Yorkshire in the early 19th century, and the Ancient Order of Shepherds.

It is in Gatundu South constituency, Kiambu County. Proximate towns are Gatundu (south), Ruiru (south west) and Juja (South east). Other villages neighbouring Ituru includes, Giathi, Gaithece, Gitundu, Itwiku, Muthurumbi, Giathi and Kagumoini.  Ethnic community and religion  Ituru belongs to rural highland north of capital Nairobi. Local people are mainly of the Kikuyu people also called the Agikuyu. The settlement also has several people from other ethnic groups in Kenya present in the region for business purposes. The people in this town are mostly Christians. Only churches are present, including St Stephen Wamukaya Catholic church PCEA Ituru Church AIPCA Muthutumbi church  Economic activities  The main economic activity in Gatundu town is business. Businessmen and businesswomen in this town do their day-to-day activities in various businesses. An open-air market in the town attracts many buyers and sellers from the neighboring villages. There is only one supermarket called Happy Supermarket and several general stores. The neighboring villages are agricultural productive and therefore feeds the market with agricultural commodities (Silver Chase, 2013).  Transport and communication  The local public service vans, minibuses and taxis play a major role in transport industry of this town. Vans (also called matatus) transport passengers from the town to other towns including Nairobi city, Thika, Ruiru, Juja and Kamwangi towns. A big challenge is the road network. Except the roads connecting the town to Nairobi and Thika, all the other roads are dry weather roads which makes it impassable during rainy seasons to connect to the highly productive villages. Motorbikes also called \\"bondabondas\\" are common in this place and therefore competing with taxis which transport people to areas not covered by matatus. The area is covered well by the local mobile service providers in Kenya namely safaricom, Yu, Orange and Airtel. Mobile phones are therefore commonly used as the means of communication. Several cyber cafes also assist with internet services. There is also Gatundu Post Office.  Academic institutions  The place lacks adequate institutions of higher learning.

It was first published in 1967 (1374 Bengali Era) in the Sharodiyo Desh special (page no 174-226), a well known Bengali monthly magazine, a presentation of the Ananda Publishers. This novel is about a young boy who is used as the premises to understand not only his background but of the society at large. It was a young lawyer named Amal Mitra who first filed a charge of obscenity against the author Samaresh Basu and the publisher Shitangsukumar Dasgupta on 2 February 1968 for the novel Prajaproti. Later the Government of West Bengal supported Amal Mitra and spoke against Prajapoti. The Lower Court gave the verdict that the book was indeed obscene and had no literary value whatsoever. The High Court went on to uphold the just mentioned verdict. After a long time of almost seventeen years, Prajapoti got rid of the stigma 'banned' after a verdict given by Supreme Court of India in its favour. Reportedly, Prajapati had been published by Ananda Publishers as a hard cover book before the charge of obscenity had been made against it. In its second edition in 1985 soon after the verdict had been overturned it made record sales. The 11th edition of Projapoti states that the first edition had printed 8800 copies but from the second through the tenth edition (from 1985–2003), the sales went up to 48,000 copies! Plot summary The novel opens with Sukhen, the protagonist, trying to capture a butterfly. Sukhen goes over to his lover's house early in the morning. Even as he tries to catch a butterfly, he is simultaneously taking with his lover and analysing his own life as he recollects the past. Sukhen had been brought up in a family where he had found no love or affection. His mother died leaving behind her husband and three sons- Keshob, Purnendu, Sukhendu. Both of his elder brothers are politicians and according to Sukhen mere opportunists. The brothers used people for their own benefit and cheat them without remorse. He remembers his mother as an extremely flirtatious woman. Sukhen's father is also devoid of any moral depth and realisation. He was a mean money minded man. Sukhen had grown up with in these circumstances. He became venturous and had no respect for elders and women. The neighbours especially the rich ones feared him. Mr. Chopra, manager of neighbouring industry and Mr. Mittir, the labour advisor, always flattered Sukhen out of fear. Sukhen remembers Jina, the daughter of Mr. Mittir who had been seduced by her kaku (uncle), Mr. Chatterjee, a colleague of her father. Sukhen also had seduced Jina. Sukhen had become addicted to women and alcohol at a very early age, soon after having entered college. Subsequently, he got attracted to a girl named Shikha. Sukhen fell in love with Shikha when he was taking in a hunger strike conducted on the demand to rehabilitate a teacher of his college who had recently been fired by the college authority and to stop the rising of a multi-storeyed building close to the college gate. Unlike Sukhen, Shikha hailed from a poor family. Her father is a drunkard and numb to the affairs of the family. Shikha's two brothers were subordinates of Sukhen's two elder brothers in the respective political parties of the latter. Her only sister, Bela was married but stayed at her father's house and flirted with several men. However the presence of Shikha in Sukhen's life offered some respite to his careless and perplexed life. This relationship somehow helped to revive the latent sense of humanity in Sukhen. Sukhen hates hipocrisy. He hated those politicians who cheated and oppressed people for their own ulterior need and those teachers who used his students as a political weapon for personal benefits as well as the owners and governing body members of industries who squeeze the labourers; also the parents who were indifferent to their children, the lechers who abused children for sexual satisfaction. He also disliked the heinous attack of American soldiers on prostitutes. The atrocities around him agonised and traumatized him. He sometimes suffers from a subtle pain down to his shoulder and channelised his energy into anger to numb and forget the pain. He pees under his father's table, rumples his brothers' rooms, calls out to servants and so on to divert his attention. Yet, the otherwise brash Sukhen, respected Shulada, an old servant of their house. Keshob, the elder brother of Sukhen, is a powerful political leader. The brother allegedly illegally traded in baby foods and railway spare parts. Keshob has several relations with married women and young girls who were members in his own party. Purnendu, the immediate elder brother is also a political leader and an employee in a governmental office. His political party apparently worked for the poor section of the country and fought for justice but ironically, he is the who copulates with their maid servant's daughter. Both of his brothers want him to join their party! Sukhen refuses to join either of them and severely criticises their agendas. He ends up being the enemy of both the groups. As we proceed through the novel, we see Suhken breaking off one wing of the butterfly and though Shikha tries to revive it, the fly eventually dies. After having chatted with Shikha for some time, he leaves for home. But instead going home, he moves around on the roads on his bike and sees Nirapodobabu (নিরাপদবাবু), a primary school master watching Ramesh (রমেশ), a worker of Purnendu's party, delivering a lecture. He wonders about the peaceful life of Nirapadababu and dreams of having a wife like Nirapadababu's. He plans of marrying Shikha and living peacefully like Nirapadababu. He also enjoys the company of the superintendent of police of the local police station, N’Kori Haldar (ন’কড়ি হালদার), and Bimol (বিমল) a devoted worker of Purnendu's party. As he thinks of living a simple life with Shikha as his wife, he stops by to meet Mr. Chopra and get himself a job. But Chopra refuses him as he known that Suhken is a hooligan and the local mischief. Perturbed, Suhken wonders who are the simple and good boys? (সাধারন বাঙ্গালি ছেলে কারা?) Sukhen then goes in search of Shutka(শুটকা), a friend of his. He ends up finding Shibe (শিবে), another friend of him in Doyalda's (দয়ালদা) tea stall. Suddenly he feels that strange pain close to his shoulder. To suppress that pain he has alcohol almost voraciously and goes to Shibe's house and there he meets Manjori (মঞ্জরী) and falls asleep. In the evening, he woke up and found Shutka close to him. He goes to Shikha's house again as he had promised to go there in the evening. At last, he comes back home at night and takes a bath and sleeps without having food. The next day there is a strike. He goes out in the evening and fells in midst of two processions. He gets severely injured in a bomb explosion and is admitted in a hospital. One of his arms had been blown off and he finally succumbs to the injury. Controversies=Charge On 2 February 1968 a young Bengali advocate Amal Mitra complained in the court of Chief Presidency Magistrate at Calcutta that Prajapati, a novel by Samaresh Basu \\"contains matters which are obscene and both the accused persons have sold, distributed, printed and exhibited the same which has the tendency to corrupt the morals of those in whose hands the said Sarodiya Desh may fall\\". Both the accused people, Samaresh Basu and Sitangshu Kumar Dasgupta, the publisher and the printer of Desh at the relevant time were said to have committed an offence punishable under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 292 read with Section 109 IPC (abetment).1\\\\. http://infochangeindia.org/Media/Broadcast- Laws-and-Regulations/Obscenity-under-the-law-A- review-of-significant- cases.html Bankshall Court trial The trial began at Bankshall Court, Kolkata under the sixth presidency magistrate Mr. R. L. Mukherjee. On 6 March 1968 Amal Mitra presented two witnesses Samarendra Basu and Kaloboron Ghosh both residents of Ballygunj. All the three said that Prajapati was an entirely obscene novel and showed concern that it would harm moral character of young generation. Samaresh Basu turned up on 6 July 1968 at the Bankshal Court. He was asked to pay a fine of rupees one thousand. Karunashankar Ray, barrister S. N. Voumik, advocate Jyanshankar Sengupta, advocate Samar Basu attended the case for Prajapati whereas advocate Topen Ray Choudhuri, Harendra Kishor Singh, Binaybhushan Dutt and Kamalesh Mitra attended the case against Prajapati. On 9 November, Sitangshu Kumar Dasgupta turned up at the court. Samaresh Basu presented his indictment before court on 16 November. In his piece, he refuted the charges made against Prajapati Budhyadeb Basu, a well known literary figure of Bengali literature and formerly Chairman of Comparative Literature Society of Jadavpur University, attended the Court on 16h November to give witness for Prajapati. In his speech he repeatedly emphasised that this novel has projected some characters which are essentially part of our contemporary society. He also quoted some passages from the scriptures in defence of Prajapati. He said that the scriptures also described the theme of sexuality openly. But he was argued with the lawyers of the opposition that such scriptures were protected by special law! Budhadev Basu's main argument was that sometimes in great literature the flickering of vulgarity could be seen but it did not necessarily mean obscenity. This vulgarity became subdued because of the merit of literature and art. Naresh Guha, the then Head of the Department of Comparative Literature of Jadavpur University, attended the court on 18 November and gave witness for Prajapati and reaffirmed it was a work entirely free from obscenity. He also confirmed that this novel could by no means be harmful for the young. The main charge was made against the passages where Shukhen describes Shikha's body features; also the event of a picnic where Jina meets Sukhen beside a sugarcane field was regarded as obscene and underlined in red by Amal Mitra. Two other episodes that were termed obscene were i) one between Sukhen and Manjari and the other ii) between Purnendu and the maidservant's daughter were also held to be obscene. The final verdict of the Bankshal Court went against Samaresh Basu and Shitangsu Kumar Dasgupta. Prajapati was convicted as an obscene work. Mr. Basu and Mr. Dasgupta were convicted under the Indian Penal Code No. 292. The author was sentenced to pay two hundred and one rupees for writing and publishing an obscene novel and the amount had to be paid within two months, failing which there would be a jail term. Once the time was over to appeal against this verdict 174-226 pages of Sharadiyo Desh of 1374 had to be destroyed. High Court trial Both Samaresh Basu and Shitangsu Kumar Dasgupta and Amal Mitra and State Government of West Bengal appealed to the High Court of Kolkata. The writer urged to overturn the verdict of Bankshal Court whereas Amal Mitra appealed for enhancement of punishment. Both appeals went under Justice N. C. Talukdar's Court. Samaresh Basu had appealed on 17 February 1969, appeal number 106/1969 and Amal Mitra appealed on 12 March 1969 and the appeal number was 299/1969. Both the accuser and the accused tried to explain in the High Court trial their point of view. The verdict of the High Court was issued on 27 June 1972. The High Court upheld the verdict given by Bankshal Court. This time the novel Prajapati, published by Ananda Publishers came to be banned. Four years had passed since 1968 and Prajapati had gone onto the 8th edition. After that verdict of Kolkata High Court, one day some police raided Ananda Publishers Private Limited, 45, Beniatola Lane, College Street, the publisher of Prajapati with the intention of seizing the remaining copies of the novel. The Managing director of APL and the chief executive of Anandabazar Partika decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. An application was sent to the Kolkata High Court seeking permission to attend Supreme Court according to the article number 134(1) of the constitution. But Justice Amaresh Ray tossed away the application. The trial judge and high court regarded the convicted passages as obscene because of the descriptions of female body and frequent use of slang. The remarks made by Badhyadev Basu and Naresh Guha were treated notoriously by the trial judge of Kolkata High Court. He considered their judgement as oblivious and meaningless. He said that it was not the specialist but for the judiciary to judge whether something was obscene in writing or not. In the written copy of the verdict he mentions Hicklin- 1 ...whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscene is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall. Supreme Court trial Samaresh Basu and the authority of Desh appealed to the Supreme Court of India on 9 July 1973 by Special Leave according to Penal code No: 136 of Indian Constitution. This appeal was fixed with Justice H.R. Khanna and Justice Algiri Swami on 24 August 1973. The Supreme Court accepted this appeal against the order of High Court of Kolkata. The Supreme Court appeal number was 174/1973 for Samaresh Basu and Shitangsu Kumar Dasgupta versus Amal Mitra and West Bengal Government. On 24 September 1985, the final verdict of Supreme Court came out. It declared Prajapati as free from the charges of obscenity and all the complaints overturned from Samaresh Basu and Shitangsu Kumar Dasgupta. The court concluded: \\"On a very anxious consideration and after carefully applying our judicial mind in making an objective assessment of the novel, we do not think that it can be said with any assurance that the novel is obscene merely because slang and unconventional words have been used in the book in which there have been emphasis on sex and description of female bodies and there are the narrations of feelings, thoughts and actions in vulgar language\\". Finally it took 12 years and the verdict of the Supreme Court for the novel to be cleared of charges. Sagarmoy Ghosh, the working editor of Desh of that time noted this event as an historical landmark in Bengali literature. He said that there were some books that got banned and subsequently released from conviction from the local court. But he said that he did not know of any such event like Prajapati that had gone on to face conviction for seventeen years. The novel was published again.2\\\\. ১৮৪(184), Appendix of 11th edition of Prajapati compiled by Bijit Kumar Basu. Public response All the trial had been accomplished with huge crowd in the court room. People responded fluently. The question of obscenity became an issue of discussion even outside the court. Several meetings were held at University of Calcutta. This debate extended elsewhere as well. Main debateInterpretations This text had received various interpretations. Samaresh Basu said that the existence of Sukhen is a burning question in our society. He is a product of our society. He used first person narrative style so that he could portray Sukhen in a lively manner. We can identify with Sukhen through his speech and his process of thinking. Prajapati is a metaphor for Sukhen's life and beyond. It is a symbol of beauty. But it has been killed when it refused to get caught. In the end, we notice that Sukhen had lost one arm as had the butterfly at the beginning of the novel. Amal Mitra's argument was that Prajapati has no literary value whatsoever. That only thing it could do was to corrupt the reader and cause moral degradation in them. In this novel he found Sukhen no more than ruffian. Another witness Kalaboron Ghosh said Prajapati was entirely obscene. There could be no reason except earning money as the possible reason behind writing this. No one can hand it over to his children or family member. Budhadeb Basu supported this novel and substantiated the use of slang words and the description of female body as a need to add vivacity to the characters. He also argued the description of sexuality was universal in literature. Sukhen was a common human being. He did not fall in the category of the conventional 'vodrolok' but there are people like him. His love for Shikha was the nadir that was helped him to restore himself back in the mainstream of the society. To Budhadev Basu this novel placed a high moral lesson through its depiction of the psychology of Sukhen. This novel also discussed how the families of urban Bengal sometimes worked. It arouses consciousness in the mind of the readers and helped to recognise the society we live in. Dr. Naresh Guha reported that Prajapati is a conscious criticism of society. No part of this novel could be charged with obscenity. He didn't think it would help any reader to become corrupted. Law of obscenity Both the Bankshal court and High Court accused Prajapati as obscene. The trial judges pronounced their verdict under section 292 of Indian Penal Code which maintains the Hicklin test. Several important propositions were raised on the law of obscenity in India while dealing with this case. What is obscenity? What are the determinants of obscenity in literature? ‘…legal concept used to characterize certain (particularly sexual) material as offensive to the public sense of decency. A wholly satisfactory definition of obscenity is elusive, however, largely because what is considered obscene is often, like beauty, in the eye of the beholder. Although the term originally referred to things considered repulsive, it has since acquired a more specifically sexual meaning.'44\\\\. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424001/obscenity The concept of obscenity is moulded to a very great extent by the social outlook of the people who are generally expected to read the book. The concept of obscenity usually differs from country to country depending on the standards of morality of contemporary society. In India, the principal statutory provision on the subject of obscene publication is to be found in section 292 of the Indian Penal Code stated above. Sub section (2) of it punishes a variety of acts concerning obscene publication and obscene objects. So far as the journalists are concerned, the material provisions are to be found in clauses (a) and (b) of the subsections. Though the amendment of 1969 brought about some changes it did not still lay down in its definition. The conviction was made about using slang words in Prajapati that was unfamiliar with the literature of the time. Mr. P M Bakshi stated in his article \\"The Need for a New Convention\\"5\\\\. Mr. P M Bakshi,'The Need for a New Convention' Times of India, 22 July 1986‘... the mere fact that the language used was vulgar would not be enough to render the book as obscene. Vulgar writing is not necessarily obscene. The essence of obscenity of a novel is the effect of depraving, debasing and corrupting the morals of the readers of the novel. Vulgarity may arouse disgust and revulsion but does not necessarily corrupt the morals of the reader.' Debate was raised about the disputable status of Hicklin test in present-day India. Generally speaking existing obscenity laws in countries like UK and USA are more liberal than their counterparts in India. Experts do feel the need for updated obscenity laws. Because of rapid transformation of society it's very hard and most of the time impossible to cope up these charges made against literature with the help of such outdated laws. Dealing with the charges of obscenity in literature in India one must look way back to 1860 in England. Though a century later Britain liberalized its obscenity laws the Indian laws are yet stuck to the moral standards prevalent in 19th-century Britain. As there is no explanatory note for the term obscene, the interpretation of it may become highly subjective and therefore contentious. Sometimes the judiciary argues that they are concerned about 'popular permissiveness' as they regard themselves guardian of public morals. But who is to decide what the level of permissiveness in society? In Prajapat’si case both the Bankshal and lower court ironically took charges to decide its permissiveness in society. The Supreme Court adopted a different attitude though. It distinguished between vulgarity and obscenity and insisted that the only standard of a writer must not be to go by the fact that the adolescent might encounter sex in a particular literary work. Mr. Bakshi also noted in his article that a perceptive reader of judgment would notice Supreme Court's attention to balance between several inter conflicting factors which has a tendency to compete each other whenever the question of obscenity is raised. These factors are – the young and adolescent reader versus the total reading audience; literary merit of a book versus possible moral objections against its content; realism in literature which is the author's predominant consideration versus maintenance of the existing social order which is a requirement of the society; and finally, the creative urge of the writer which is essentially limitless, as contrasted with the various legal constraints through which the society tries its right to impose restraints on the creative activities which can cause harm. An independent and enlightened judiciary is the best agency to resolve such controversies. The assessment of obscenity under legal terms is at the same time gray and vague as the term itself. The lack of space for a common understanding of what is immoral and what is not gives rise to other controversies that dwell under this umbrella term. There are innumerable instances throughout the history of censorship in literature which has dealt with other politics that back charges of obscenity. Adaptation In 1993 a Bengali film Prajapati was made by Biplab Chatterjee based on the story. Soumitra Chatterjee, Satabdi Roy, Robi Ghosh and Mamata Shankar acted in the film.

The album is one of the first showcases of the pointillism and silence that would inform much of his later work. Open, to Love was selected as part of the ECM Touchstones series, as one of the most influential recordings on the label.Open To Love at ECM Records Reception The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 5 stars stating \\"Despite the fact that pianist and composer Paul Bley had been a renowned and innovative jazzman for nearly 20 years, 1973 saw the release of his most mature and visionary work, and one that to this day remains his opus. This is one of the most influential solo piano recordings in jazz history, and certainly one that defined the sound of the German label ECM... Ultimately, what Bley offers is jazz pianism as a new kind of aural poetics, one that treats the extension of the composer's line much as the poet treats the line as the extension of breath.

In 2014, according to ISI Web of Knowledge, he is the most cited microbiologist in Europe, and the seventh worldwide. According to the Thomson Reuters source \\"Highly Cited Researchers List\\", Raoult is among the most influential researchers in his field and his publications are among the 1% most consulted in academic journals. He is one of the 99 most cited microbiologists in the world and one of the 73 most highly cited French scientists. He is a world reference for Q fever and Whipple's disease.Science et Santé magazine nº 1er décembre 2010 p. 14 As of April 2017, he had over 104,000 citations and an h-index of 148. He is also on the list of the 400 most cited authors in the biomedical world. Raoult's extremely high publication rate results from his \\"attaching his name to nearly every paper that comes out of his institute\\", a practice that has been called \\"grossly unethical\\" by Steven Salzberg. Since 2013 he has been one of the oversea scientists co-afflliated to the King Abdulaziz University of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, known to \\"offer highly cited researchers lucrative adjunct professorships, with minimal requirements for them to be physically present, in return for being listed by them as a secondary affiliation\\", and so increase its own institutional citation index. It was reported that of the 1,836 articles published by Raoult between 1995 and 2020 (amounting to more than 120 a year), 230 were published in 2 reviews edited by Michel Drancourt who is his right-hand man at the IHU and colleague for over 35 years. Members of his staff have editorial functions at almost half of the revues that have published his work. It has been suggested that the way that health institutes obtain funding by linking it to the number of publications made by the institute may be at the root of the large number of publications.  Controversies = American Society for Microbiology publishing ban  In 2006, Raoult and four co-authors were banned for one year from publishing in the journals of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), after a reviewer for Infection and Immunity discovered that four figures from the revised manuscript of a paper about a mouse model for typhus were identical to figures from the originally submitted manuscript, even though they were supposed to represent a different experiment. In response, Raoult \\"resigned from the editorial board of two other ASM journals, canceled his membership in the American Academy of Microbiology, ASM’s honorific leadership group, and banned his lab from submitting to ASM journals\\". In response to Science covering the story in 2012, he stated that, \\"I did not manage the paper and did not even check the last version\\". The paper was subsequently published in a different journal.  COVID-19  On 17 March 2020, Raoult announced in an online video that a trial involving 24 patients from southeast France supported the claim that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were effective in treating for COVID-19. On 20 March, he published a preliminary report of his study online in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. The French Health Minister, Olivier Véran, was reported as announcing that \\"new tests will now go ahead in order to evaluate the results by Professor Raoult, in an attempt to independently replicate the trials and ensure the findings are scientifically robust enough, before any possible decision might be made to roll any treatment out to the wider public\\". Veran refused to endorse the study conducted by Raoult and the possible health ramifications, on the basis of a single study conducted on 24 people. The French media also reported that the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi had offered French authorities millions of doses of the drug for use against COVID-19. On 3 April, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal, issued a statement that the report on the non-blind, non-randomized study \\"does not meet the Society's expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\\". Raoult was one of 11 prominent scientists named on 11 March to a committee to advise on scientific matters pertaining to the epidemic in France. He did not attend any of the meetings and resigned from the committee on 24 March saying that he refused to participate.. He denounced the \\"absence of anything scientific sound,\\" and criticised its members for \\"not having a clue.\\" He defended chloroquine as a benchmark drug for lung diseases, saying that it had suddenly been declared dangerous after having been safely used for 80 years. A meta analysis of 29 studies published in 26 August 2020 showed hydroxychloroquine alone is not effective for the treatment of COVID-19 on hospitalized patients and that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increases the risk of mortality.

The fort was, in its time, the largest in New England. The fort was originally built in 1692 but destroyed four years later by New France in the Siege of Pemaquid (1696). A reconstruction was built in 1908. The fort was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 1, 1969. Fort William Henry is now operated as a museum about the fort's history. Fort William Henry is part of the Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site, which also includes the archaeological excavations of 17th and 18th century village buildings and a museum with excavated artifacts found on the site, including musket balls, coins, pottery and early hardware. History The first fort on this site was Abraham Shurte's Fort (1630–1633), a palisaded trading post that was burned down by pirates under Dixie Bull. The next fort on the site was Fort Pemaquid (1633–1676), which was destroyed in the Northwest Coast Campaign (1676) during King Philip's War.  Fort Charles  After the Northeast Coast Campaign (1677) during King Philips War, another fort was established with the Treaty of Casco (1678), this third fort was named Fort Charles (1677–1689). Captain Anthony Brockholst (Brockholes) was left in command of Pemaquid in March 1689. Fort Charles was captured early in King William's War. The English regained their authority over the region by building Fort William Henry.  Fort William Henry  Fort William Henry was built in 1692 during King William's War. The English constructed it to defend against the French and Wabanaki Confederacy of Acadia. The English built Fort William Henry as a fortress to protect the northern boundary of New England. (Present-day Castine, Maine was an Acadian settlement, which marked the effective southern boundary of Acadia.) Massachusetts government used one third of its budget to build the fort.Alfred E. Kayworth, Raymond G. Potvin. The scalp hunters: Abenaki ambush at Lovewell Pond, 1725, p. 104 Construction of the fort was ordered by Massachusetts Governor Sir William Phips and cost £20,000 to build. The English colonial militia leader Benjamin Church assisted in the construction.Drake, The Border Wars of New England, p. 85 The fort was built with walls that were 10 to 22 feet in height and a stone bastion which was 29 feet in height. The fort was armed with 20 cannon and a garrison of 60 soldiers. The fort was attacked by a combined force of French and Native Americans in the Siege of Pemaquid (1696). The English were forced to surrender the fort and abandon the Pemaquid area. Benjamin Church avenged the destruction of the fort with the Raid on Chignecto (1696) against Acadia.  Fort Frederick  View of Fort House and foundation remnants of Fort Frederick After Father Rale's War, Colonel David Dunbar, Surveyor-General of the King's Woods, rebuilt the fort in 1729–1730, renaming it Fort Frederick. During King George's War, Fort Frederick was attacked during the Northeast Coast Campaign (1745) by bands of Penobscot and Norridgewock.Williamson, p. 236 They took captive a woman, which alarmed the garrison but she escaped. The fort withstood two attacks in 1747. During the French and Indian War, the fort was decommissioned in 1759 after a new Fort Frederick was built on the Saint John River the previous year. In 1775, the town dismantled the fort to prevent it from becoming a British stronghold during the Revolutionary War. During the War of 1812, the waters off Pemaquid Point saw the capture of HMS Boxer by the USS Enterprise on September 5, 1813. The fort was occupied by the British twice during the war. The state acquired the site in 1902, and in 1908 rebuilt the tower of Fort William Henry under guidance of historian John Henry Cartland, using many original stones. In 1969, the fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The entire state historic site (including the fort and other surrounding colonial archaeological remains) was designated the \\"Pemaquid Archeological Site\\" National Historic Landmark District in 1993.

It has no licensing from Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association; meaning that Nolan Ryan is the only non-fictional ballplayer in the entire game. All the other players have names that appear to be given names while Nolan Ryan uses his surname. Gameplay Different modes for playing include exhibition and regular season (lasting anywhere from ten games per team to an impressive 100 games per team). Unusual for a game at that time, it allowed a position player to be chosen as a relief pitcher or even as a starting pitcher. There is no designated hitter rule in this game so that the pitchers must go up to bat with their .150 batting average (which is below the Mendoza Line). While pitchers are not expected to hit above the Mendoza Line, having a hitter (or a group of hitters) go through a season with a batting average below .200 could indicate a lack of player skill. North American batting screen. There is no playoffs mode after regular season because all the teams are under one league. However, if more than one team has the lead for the pennant, a short elimination tournament will be held to determine the champion. The graphics look childish although their pitches are similar in speed to the actual Major League Baseball of that time. Players also have a tendency to march down the field at a slow speed regardless of their ratings and throws from the outfield tend to be less powerful than similar throws done from the infield. The stats are followed throughout the entire year (for all the teams involved) and are adjusted after every play. Baseball players can be created from scratch, traded to other teams in favor of their pre-existing players, traded in for free agents, and have their attributes altered in order to make the perfect ballplayer.

A sequel, titled Love in the Buff was released on 29 March 2012 with the film being set in Beijing, China. Shawn Yue and Miriam Yeung reprised their roles. A third installment, Love Off the Cuff, was released on April 27, 2017. Plot Since 2007, the Hong Kong government banned smoking in all indoor areas, causing smokers from neighboring buildings to gather for cigarette breaks during office hours at trash bins with ashtrays near their work premises. The regulars started sharing small talks and dirty jokes like friends at a hot pot dinner and this community became known as the \\"Hot Pot Pack\\". Jimmy (Yue) is an advertising executive who befriended Cherie (Yeung), a cosmetic sales girl, at a \\"Hot Pot Pack\\" shortly after Jimmy broke up with his girlfriend who cheated on him. Cherie's flirting with Jimmy during their cigarette breaks, through text messages and excursions at night eventually led to Cherie's break up with her live-in boyfriend. This sudden change in their relationship, including a failed one night stand at a love motel, caused them to confront the change in their relationship and consider whether they are viewing each other as love interests or just as companions during lonely nights.

Although the community was settled in the 18th century, most of its downtown area dates to the second half of the 19th century due to an 1845 fire. Lining Main Street east of the Damariscotta River, the downtown has a well-preserved collection of commercial, residential, and civic structures from the period. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and enlarged in 2001. Description and history The town of Damariscotta, located in the Mid Coast part of Maine, is located at the head of navigation of the Damariscotta River. This area has a colonial history dating to 1625, when land including the town was purchased from Native Americans by John Brown. The town was first settled in 1754, and was incorporated in 1847 from parts of Bristol and Nobleboro. The town was by then a significant shipbuilding center. Its downtown was largely destroyed by a fire in 1845, after which it was rebuilt in brick and wood. Many of its buildings date from this period or later in the 19th century. Damariscotta's downtown is located on a neck of land that projects into the broad Damariscotta River, where Main Street (United States Route 1, the area's main thoroughfare) crosses to the downtown area of Newcastle on the west side. Commercial buildings line the southern side of Main Street as far as Water Street, while the north side is lined by a combination of commercial and residential properties up to Church Street. Many of the residences on the western portion of the north side have been adapted for commercial use. These notably include two particularly fine houses, the Matthew Cottrill House and the Stephen Coffin House, were built by leading shipbuilders and merchants in the early 19th century and survived the 1845 fire. At the eastern end of the district is the 1754 Chapman-Hall House, one of the oldest in the town, and the 1840s Greek Revival Damariscotta Baptist Church.

Newgate is known for its vintage, industrial, retro and mid-century style designs. Products include men's and women's watches, alarm clocks, mantel clocks, wall clocks and outdoor clocks. The company also designs and makes clocks for other brands. Background Newgate was founded in 1991 by the current owners Jim and Chloe Read from the spare room of their apartment. The name came from the old New Gate Toll adjacent to the Read's apartment and first home in Oswestry. Jim had just been kicked out of art college when he met Chloe. They moved in together and sold their vintage Mini Moke car to fund the purchase of second hand machinery to start making framed art. Quite by accident they bought some quartz clock movements which they fitted to the dials they painted and mounted in frames and cases. The clocks were first seen at a trade exhibition at London's Alexandra Palace where orders for clocks were received from Harrods, dozens of home stores and several European distributors. In the 1990s, 75 percent of the clocks produced were exported around the world. The clocks were all manufactured in the Oswestry factory until 2003 when production moved to Asia, benefiting from lower manufacturing costs and higher production capacities. The decision to create a fusion brand called Jones Clocks was made in 2005. Jones Clocks is a fashion clock brand, and its products are sold to supermarkets and large home and DIY centres. In 2009 the company purchased a large ex Laura Ashley factory in Oswestry that required refurbishment to include new facilities, offices and showrooms which were built in a classic style and furnished with original 1940s furniture throughout. The building also houses Newgate's design studios and its comprehensive collection of industrial and vintage clocks. In 2012 work started on a range of watches. The Newgate Watch collection took three years to come to fruition when a range of fifty watches was launched at the Spring Fair in Birmingham, UK, in February 2015. The UK watch trade publication WatchPro featured Newgate Watch founders Jim and Chloe Read in the Trailblazer category of the WatchPro Hot 100 of 2016. A portfolio of short films were made in 2015 to showcase each watch and clock family.

Built in 1801, it is a well-preserved example of Federal period architecture. It is historically significant for its association with Matthew Cottrill, an Irish immigrant who was, along with business partner James Kavanagh, a major economic force in Damariscotta, and also a key force in establishing the Roman Catholic church in Maine. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 2, 1974. Description and history The house in 2014 The Matthew Cottrill House stands on the north side of Main Street in downtown Damariscotta. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a low-pitch hip roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. The front facade is symmetrically arranged, with five bays. The outer bays have sash windows with shutters, while the main entrance is in the center bay, sheltered by a half-round portico with Doric columns supporting a plain frieze. Above the entrance is a smaller sash window, topped by a half- round fan. A long single-story ell, probably built before the current main block, extends the building to the rear. The ell of the house is believed to have been built about 1760, by members of the locally prominent Chapman family. The main block was built in 1801 by Nicholas Codd for Matthew Cottrill. Both Codd and Cottrill were Irish immigrants; Codd was a builder in Boston, Massachusetts who was invited to the Damariscotta area by Rev. Francis Matignon. He is credited with construction of several fine houses in addition to this one, as well as St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Damariscotta Mills (part of Newcastle), the oldest Catholic church in the state. Cottrill and his friend and business partner James Kavanagh (for whom Codd built a house in Damariscotta Mills) were a major economic force in the Damariscotta area, operating mills, shipyards, and ships on the Damariscotta River.

This compound was the first transition metal hydride discovered. The complex is stable at low temperatures but decomposes rapidly at temperatures above –20 °C.  Preparation  Iron tetracarbonyl hydride was first produced by Hieber and Leutert by protonation of HFe(CO): :Fe(CO)5 \\\\+ 2 OH− → HFe(CO) + HCO :HFe(CO) + H+ → H2Fe(CO)4 Since the compound is thermally labile and sensitive to light, ideal conditions in 1930's Munich called for winter nights. The early method was called the \\"polar night synthesis.\\" Current procedures resemble that of Hieber and Leutert. The compound is generally purified by trap-to-trap distillation.  Structure and properties  In iron tetracarbonyl hydride the Fe(CO)4 group has C2v molecular symmetry with a geometry intermediate between octahedral and tetrahedral. Viewed as an octahedral complex, the hydride ligands are cis. Viewed as a tetrahedral Fe(CO)4 complex, the hydrides occupy adjacent faces of the tetrahedron. Although the structure of tetracarbonyliron with the hydrogen atoms bound as a single H2 ligand has been proposed as an intermediate in some rearrangement reactions, the stable state for the compound has the two atoms as independent ligands.  Reactions  H2Fe(CO)4 undergoes rapid ligand substitutions by phosphorus ligands: :H2Fe(CO)4 \\\\+ PPh3 → H2Fe(CO)3PPh3 The substitution mechanism is proposed to entail transient formation of a 16e− formyl intermediate. H2Fe(CO)4 has pK1 of 6.8 and pK2 of 15. The monoanion [HFe(CO)4]− has more extensive reaction chemistry because it is more stable than the dihydride.Brunet, J.-J.; Chauvin, R.; Diallo, O.; Kindela, F.; Leglaye, P.; Neibecker, D., \\"Coordination chemistry of mononuclear iron carbonyl complexes\\", Coordination Chemistry Reviews 1998, 178-180, 331-352. The monoanion is an intermediate in the homogeneous iron-carbonyl-catalyzed water-gas shift reaction (WGSR). The slow step in the WGSR is the proton transfer from water to the iron hydride anion.Crabtree, R.H. Mingos D.M.P. 2007. Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry III From Fundamentals to Applications.

It has been split since the nineteenth century into East and West Divisions (an Roinn Thoir/Thiar).Carbery West (W.D.) Legal context Baronies were created after the Norman invasion of Ireland as divisions of counties and were used the administration of justice and the raising of revenue. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they have been administratively obsolete since 1898. However, they continue to be used in land registration and in specification, such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier Gaelic túath which had submitted to the Crown.  History  Originally Carbery West formed a single Barony of Carbery with Carbery East. This was essentially a small, semi-independent kingdom, ruled over by the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty from the 13th through 16th centuries, that broke away from the larger Kingdom of Desmond. Patrick Weston Joyce said the name Carbery comes from Uí Chairpre Áebda, of which a sept, the O'Donovans under Cathal Ua Donnubáin, migrated to the area c.1300 after being driven from County Limerick by the Fitzgeralds. Canon John O'Mahony disagreed, and offered three alternatives: Cairpre founder of Dál Riata; or Cairbre of Uibh Laoghaire; or the Ui Carbre of Corcu Loígde, from whom Rosscarbery in the barony of Carbery East is named. However, supporting the first theory is that the O'Donovans, such as Crom Ua Donnabáin, are closely associated with earliest MacCarthys in the area, and soon became their chief vassals, holding approximately right in the middle of the medieval barony.Butler, W.F.T., \\"The Barony of Carbery\\", in Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, Volume X, Second Series. 1904. pp. 1–10, 73–84  Location and settlements  Carbery West is bordered by the baronies of Carbery East to the east and Bantry to the north.

It is a registered charity in the UK. TREE AID has offices in Bristol, UK, in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in Mali, in Ethiopia and in Ghana. It currently has programmes running in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali and Niger. History and philosophy TREE AID was established in 1987 by a group of foresters in response to the famine in Africa brought to public attention by Band Aid and Live Aid. Its aim was to provide a long-term solution to the challenges of poverty and environmental decline once the emergency relief efforts ended. TREE AID's founders – inspired by the Chipko and Greenbelt movement in India and Kenya respectively - believed that community forestry could ensure that people in rural Africa's drylands were less vulnerable to drought and famine in future. Drawing on the ideas of thinkers and practitioners such as E F Schumacher and Robert Chambers, TREE AID's work is informed by the notion that small-scale development, appropriate to local culture and environment that puts poor people's needs first, is essential to the success and sustainability of any intervention to alleviate poverty. This thinking still informs the charity's work today. Focus of work TREE AID's work seeks to link up an understanding of the technical aspects of natural resource management with a deep understanding of social context, motivation and community dynamics. The organisations' work also has a strong focus on addressing institutional and policy constraints. The TREE AID programme is focused on four themes: * Natural Resource Management – Protecting and improving the environment by building greater understanding of how best to manage natural resources such as trees, water and soil. * Forest Governance – Securing long-term access to natural forest resources for the poor ensuring they can benefit from protecting and enhancing those resources. * Food and Nutrition – Helping poor communities to become more resilient in the face of drought and famine through education and awareness on nutrition and food security. * Enterprise Development and Trade – Creating the means for poor communities to invest in their families’ future through work in trade and market development. Achievements TREE AID has planted 14 million trees across the drylands of Africa with hundreds of thousands more trees being naturally regenerated through improvements in natural resource management. Over 1,000,000 villagers have directly benefitted from TREE AID's work, meaning better health, education and life chances. TREE AID has influenced a change in national forestry policy in Burkina Faso, giving control of forests to local communities.

Built in the 18th century, the small warehouse is notable for its association with Massachusetts politician John Hancock. It is the oldest known commercial structure in the state of Maine. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1969. It is now a museum property owned by Museums of Old York. Description and history The Hancock Warehouse is located south of Lindsay Road on the north bank of the York River, a short way east of the Sewall Bridge, which carries Seabury Road across the river. It is a rectangular 2-1/2 story wood frame structure measuring about , and is about tall. It has a gable roof and is finished in shingle siding. The interior is rough-hewn timber construction joined by mortise and tenon joints with wooden peg fasteners. Its second floor is accessible either via an inside stairway or an exterior ramp. There is a wheel (in working order) to facilitate the movement of goods between floors. The warehouse was built in the mid-18th century, and was by the late 1760s owned in part, along with the adjacent wharf and a store, by John Hancock as part of a large merchant empire that included warehouses up and down the Maine coast. Due to his partnership with Joseph Tucker, it is unclear if Hancock ever saw the property himself; he may have visited it in 1791 when he came to York to visit the former Loyalist and longtime friend Jonathan Sayward at his nearby house.

He primarily played as a centre, and played both outside and inside channels. Griffin last played for Connacht in the Pro14. Grifin came through Connacht's academy and played for the senior side from 2009 to 2014, before moving to London Irish. After two seasons with the exiles, he returned to Connacht ahead of the 2016–17 season. Griffin has represented his country at under-age level and was part of the Ireland under-20 team which captured the 2009 Under-20 Six Nations. Early life Griffin was raised in Barna, Galway. In his youth, he also played soccer with Salthill Devon and Gaelic football with Salthill-Knocknacarra, before settling on rugby, which he played with Corinthians. His first taste of sporting success came when Corinthians team achieved an Under 14 League/Cup double, which former playerJohnny O'Connor had also achieved when he played for the club. Griffin later won u15 cup while he won the u16 and u17 league with Corinthians during a successful period with the club. Griffin was educated at Coláiste Iognáid, where he lost the Connacht Schools Junior Cup to Garbally College after having overcome the Bish in the semi-final. Shortly after this defeat, the young Griffin suffered the first setback of his rapidly progressing career, tearing his cruciate ligament. Overcoming this he went on to become a two-time winner of the Connacht Schools Senior Cup. He has studied at NUI Galway. Professional club career=Connacht Griffin first played professionally for the Irish provincial team Connacht, based in his hometown of Galway. Griffin was first called into the senior squad against Olympus Madrid. Griffin scored a try on his first competitive start for the province in their defeat to the Llanelli Scarlets on 25 April 2010. He played seven times in 2010–11 Celtic League, scoring one try, and made an appearance in the 2010–11 European Challenge Cup against Bayonne. Griffin was also man of the match in Connacht's 26–22 win over Samoa on 9 November 2010. In March 2011, it was announced that Griffin had signed a two-year senior deal with the province and would be part of the first team squad for the coming season. Connacht played in the Heineken Cup for the first time in the 2011–12 competition, with Griffin playing in three of the province's six games. He started in the away match with Harlequins, the home match with Toulouse and the away match against Gloucester. He also made 11 starts and four substitute appearances in that year's league. In the following season, Griffin continued to be a regular part of the first team, making 16 appearances in the 2012–13 league, starting all but one of these games. Connacht featured in the top European competition again that season, with Griffin playing four times in the 2012–13 Heineken Cup. In the 2013–14 season, he played 19 times in the league and four times in the Heineken Cup. Following rumours that would join Munster, it was announced in February 2014 that Griffin had signed for English Premiership side London Irish and would leave at the end of the season. He made a total of 71 appearances in his first spell with Connacht. London Irish After three senior seasons with Connacht, Griffin joined London Irish on a two-year contract in summer 2014. He made his first appearance on 19 October 2014 when he started against Italian side Rovigo Delta in the 2014–15 Challenge Cup, and scored a try on his debut as Irish won 70–14. He made his Premiership debut on 15 November 2014 against Sale Sharks. Griffin made a total of 12 Premiership appearances and five Challenge Cup appearances in his first season. He also started in all four of London Irish's games in the 2014–15 Anglo-Welsh Cup. In his second season, Griffin struggled for gametime due to injury. He appeared in three games in the 2015–16 Premiership, but did not feature in the Anglo-Welsh or Challenge Cups. At the end of the season, London Irish were relegated to the Championship. Griffin left the club at the conclusion of his contract, having played 24 times for the side in his two seasons. Return to Connacht It was announced in December 2015 that Griffin had agreed to rejoin Connacht on a two-year deal ahead of the 2016–17 season. He made his return debut in the opening game of the season against Glasgow Warriors. As in the previous year, Griffin missed much of the season due to injury. He made just seven appearances in his first season back with the team, all of them coming in the league. International representation On the back of his performances in both successful Connacht Schools Cup campaigns he was capped for Ireland Youths and the Ireland under-20s, with whom he won the 2009 Under-20 Six Nations. In the summer of 2013 Griffin was a member of the Emerging Ireland squad that participated in the 2013 IRB Tbilisi Cup held in Georgia. He played in three games, starting two of them.

King Ling was abandoned by his troops and committed suicide days later, but initially his death was not widely known. Later, Chaowu, a former minister of Cai, tried to persuade Qiji to become the new king. However, Qiji said he would be opposed if he tried to take the throne from his elder brothers.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 26, 1984. It encompasses a collection of eight late Victorian summer mansions built as part of an exclusive development by the York Cliffs Company between 1890 and 1902, representing one of the finest such collections remaining on the coast of Maine. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The York Cliffs District extends along a portion of Agamenticus Avenue, located on a bluff overlooking the Gulf of Maine just north of the mouth of the Cape Neddick River. It includes six houses on the north side of the road, extending eastward from its western junction with Shore Road, and includes two on the south side, nearly opposite the last of the six houses. All of these houses are set on large, landscaped lots. Six of them are in the Shingle style, popular for resort buildings at the time of their construction, while one is in the more elaborate Queen Anne style. The eighth house, the first encountered at the Agamenticus and Shore, has as its oldest portion a Federal period house, built about 1800, which was enlarged with Colonial Revival additions in 1895. left The York Cliffs Development Company was founded to develop an exclusive resort community for the wealthy. In all, the company built thirteen summer houses, a golf course, and a large resort hotel, the Passaconway Inn, designed by local architect Edward Blaisdell. The hotel was torn down in the 1930s, and only eight of the company's houses have survived. At the time of their construction, these properties would have had unobstructed views of the sea, but have since been hemmed in by vegetation and infill development. These houses were furnished with the latest amenities, including water and sewer service.

It premiered on 11 May 1907 at the Frankfurt Playhouse. Plot The play takes place in 1492 in Florence. It features the eloquent preacher Girolamo Savonarola. He had once courted Fiorenza, but was rejected. Now Savonarola preaches asceticism. Fiorenza is an allegory for the city of Florence, and is the mistress of the dying Lorenzo de' Medici, the secular ruler of the city. Fiorenza cannot escape the charismatic Savonarola, even if she had rejected him as a lover. She confronts the dying Lorenzo de' Medici with this. The art-loving, secular ruler recognizes the religious leader as an equal and calls him brother. Reception The play was not a success in the theater; it was strongly criticized by Alfred Kerr. Other critics such as Theodor Lessing and Richard Schaukal stated the weakness of the play was the allegorical figure of Fiore Fiorenza. Mann's failure as a playwright probably brought him to the judgment that theater can be justified only as a popular entertainment. Text *Berlin: S. Fischer, 1906, 170 pages.

Ormrod was educated at Shrewsbury School and the Queen's College, Oxford. Although he had studied Law at university, his father insisted that he train as a doctor. After serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the Second World War, he returned to legal practice, specializing in divorce cases and becoming Queen's Counsel in 1958. In 1961 he was appointed a judge of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, and in 1974 a Lord Justice of Appeal. He was a significant figure in the development of the jurisprudence of no-fault divorce in the English courts. His best known finding, in the case Corbett v Corbett (1971), was that the male-to-female transsexual partner to a marriage, while a woman for many legal purposes, did not qualify as a woman for purposes of marriage: > sex is clearly an essential determinant of the relationship called marriage > because it is and always has been recognized as the union of man and woman. > It is the institution on which the family is built, and in which the > capacity for natural heterosexual intercourse is an essential element. [...] > Having regard to the essentially heterosexual character of the relationship > which is called marriage, the criteria must, in my judgement, be biological > [...]. My conclusion therefore is that the respondent is not a woman for the > purposes of marriage, but is a biological male and has been so since birth. > It follows that the so-called marriage of 10 September 1963 is void.Mary > Douglas (ed.), Rules and Meanings, p. 116; citing Corbett v Corbett > (otherwise Ashley), The Law Reports, Part 5, May 1971, Probate Division, pp. > 105-7.

Graves Memorial Public Library is the public library of Kennebunkport, Maine. It is located at 18 Maine Street, in a handsome brick Federal style building that served as the U.S. Customhouse from 1815 until 1913. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 18, 1974. Architecture and history The Graves Library is located on the east side of Maine Street (Maine State Route 9) in the center of Kennebunkport. It is a two-story brick building, with a hip roof and granite foundation. Its front facade, facing west, is five bays wide, with windows set in segmented-arch openings, and the entrance located asymmetrically in the second bay from the left, in a round-arch opening with a half-round transom. The interior of the building retains Federal period fixtures and trim. The building was erected between 1813 and 1815 by the Kennebunk Bank of Arundel, which operated on its first floor. The second floor was taken up by the local customs offices, whose jurisdiction covered the ports of Kennebunkport, Kennebunk and Wells. The building was purchased by the federal government in 1832, at which time the entire building was occupied by the customs offices. It continued to serve in this capacity until 1913, when the customs district was merged into that of Portland. The Kennebunkport Library Association was formed in 1916, and rented space in the building that same year. The building was bought from the government by Mr. and Mrs. Abbot Graves. They gave the property to the association in 1921, on condition it be named for their son, Louis T. Graves. The Library was expanded in 1950 and 1988. In 2017, 5,500 square feet was added to include a business center, book sale, kitchen, community room, and an elevator.

Built in 1755, it is one of the oldest surviving schoolhouses in all of New England. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Old Schoolhouse is located on the west side of Lindsay Street a short way south of its junction with York Street (United States Route 1A), just outside the center of the village of York. It stands adjacent to the Jefferds Tavern and the visitor center of the Old York Historical Society, which stands at the street corner. The schoolhouse is a small wood frame structure with a gable roof covered in wooden shingles, with exterior walls clad in clapboards. The interior is quite plain, with wide hand-planed floorboards, a fireplace at one end, a small section of plastered wall, and a few small windows. This schoolhouse was built in 1755 in the York Corner area to provide schooling for that area's children. The building's window openings were originally covered in oiled paper, which would have provided a limited amount of daylight. (The interior is currently lit by electric lights added by the museum.) It was rescued from demolition by the museum, its previous use having been as a chicken coop.
