The documentary documents a workshop that the filmmaker had conducted for a group of students at the University of Hyderabad, immediately after the student protests on the issue of the suicide of Rohith Vemula had ended at the university. Plot The film maker sets off to Hyderabad after student boycott of classes has ended at the University of Hyderabad. As a part of a documentary film-making workshop, the participants have to visit, observe, write and film at a crowded place within the campus called Shopcom, where students hang around after classes. It is also the center of the protests on the Rohith Vemula issue. As the participants read out what they have observed, they can't but bring out the issue of their deceased colleague and the sadness and bitterness associated with it. A group of singers at Shopcom sing a protest song that was written in a different context by Faiz Ahmad Faiz, an actor in Mangalore, Saumesh Bangera, reads out the last letter of Rohith Vemula, his suicide note. and on blank screen, portions of the article written by journalist Sudipto Mondal named 'Rohith Vemula, an unfinished portrait' are read out. Production When Rohith Vemula hanged himself in a hostel room on 17 January 2016, the immediate cause and the events leading up to the death came into sharp focus and got nationwide attention. This documentary film seeks to supplement this aspect. Ramchandra decided not to use video recorded by the students during the workshop or amateur footage shot by protesters, to avoid producing a workshop film or a protest film, and instead to strike a reflective tone, representing various points of view.  Release and screenings  The film was premiered on 12 November 2016 at the Kolkata International Film Festival. The film was the official selection in competition section in the Long Documentary category at the 10th International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala.http://idsffk.in/idsffk_2017.php Reception The film looks at the three generations of the Vemula family and deals with how over the centuries we have been looking at the issue of Dalits. The Hindu in its Sunday edition has describes the film as uncomfortable. > \\"Against this peaceful, even nonchalant, setting are visible the faint > silhouette of a face and a dark crop of unruly hair as we hear Vemula’s last > words. This juxtaposition is deliberately uncomfortable. It makes the > reality of what is being read out and the general sense of indifference and > injustice hang even heavier.

It defended Southern England and Wales during the Blitz and the middle years of World War II. Origin AA Command had been created in 1938 to control the Territorial Army's rapidly- expanding anti-aircraft (AA) organisation within Air Defence of Great Britain. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, it commanded seven AA Divisions, each with several AA Brigades, disposed around the United Kingdom.Sir Frederick Pile's despatch.Routledge, p. 65.Farndale, p. 5.Robert Palmer, A Concise History of Anti-Aircraft Command (History and Personnel) at British Military History. Continued expansion made this organisation unwieldy, so in November 1940 – during the Luftwaffe's nightly Blitz on London and other British cities – five further AA Divisions were organised, and all the divisions grouped under three corps headquarters directly subordinate to AA Command. The largest of these was I AA Corps, covering Southern England and South Wales, which by February 1941 comprised five AA divisions and 20 brigades. Its boundaries roughly coincided with No. 10 Group RAF and No. 11 Group RAF of RAF Fighter Command.Routledge, p. 394.Frederick, p. 1047.

It was responsible for the London Inner Artillery Zone and the Thames North and South AA belts, together with major Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) around Dover, the Solent, Plymouth, Bristol and South Wales, with 'Indicator Belts' and 'Killer Belts' of searchlights in between, the former working with the GDAs and RAF Sectors, the latter with the night fighters in the air. Redeployment was called for in 1942 when the Luftwaffe began the 'Baedeker raids' on cities such as Bath, Canterbury and Exeter, that had previously warranted little AA defence. Later, further redeployment, particularly of light AA guns, was necessary when the south coast towns of England were attacked by 'hit and run' raids, mainly by single-engined fighter-bombers, often evading radar detection, in what became known as the 'Battle of the Fringe Targets'.Routledge, pp. 387–404 & Map 35. In August 1942 the 3rd AA Divisional HQ was moved south from Scotland to join I AA Corps and assist in controlling the large number of AA units brought by this redeployment.Routledge, pp. 402–3. It was given control of 27th, 47th and 64th AA Bdes, but this lasted only for a short time. Disbandment The AA Corps and Divisional HQs were disbanded on 30 September 1942 and a replaced by a more flexible system of AA Groups, each aligned with a Group of RAF Fighter Command. The area covered by I AA Corps became the responsibility of three of the new groups: 1st AA Group (London) and 2nd AA Group (South East England) with 11 Group RAF, and 3rd AA Group (South West England and South Wales) with 10 Group RAF.Routledge, p. 401 & Map 36.

One species has been recorded in Virginia. *Northern bobwhite, Colinus virginianus Pheasants, grouse, and allies Ruffed grouse Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae Phasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from the underside of the beak and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of 1.5-1.8 meters (almost 6 feet), the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. One species has been recorded in Virginia. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are game and are sometimes hunted for food. In all Virginia species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Three species have been recorded in Virginia. *Wild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo *Ruffed grouse, Bonasa umbellus *Ring-necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus (I) (extirpated) Flamingoes Order: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae Flamingoes are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down. One species has been recorded in Virginia. *American flamingo, Phoencopterus ruber (R) Grebes Pied-billed grebe Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. Six species have been recorded in Virginia. *Pied- billed grebe, Podilymbus podiceps *Horned grebe, Podiceps auritus *Red-necked grebe, Podiceps grisegena *Eared grebe, Podiceps nigricollis (R) *Western grebe, Aechmorphorus occidentalis (R) *Clark's grebe, Aechmorphorus clarkii (R) Pigeons and doves Mourning dove Order: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere.

Three species have been recorded in Virginia. *Groove-billed ani, Crotophaga sulcirostris (A) *Yellow-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus *Black-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus erythropthalmus Nightjars and allies Common nighthawk Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet which are of little use for walking and long, pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves. Three species have been recorded in Virginia. *Common nighthawk, Chordeiles minor *Chuck- will's-widow, Antrostomus carolinensis *Eastern whip-poor-will, Antrostomus vociferus Swifts Order: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae The swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. One species has been recorded in Virginia. *Chimney swift, Chaetura pelagica Hummingbirds Ruby-throated hummingbird Order: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. Seven species have been recorded in Virginia. *Rivoli's hummingbird, Eugenes fulgens (A) *Ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris *Black-chinned hummingbird, Archilochus alexandri (A) *Calliope hummingbird, Selasphorus calliope (A) *Rufous hummingbird, Selasphorus rufus *Allen's hummingbird, Selasphorus sasin (A) *Violet-crowned hummingbird, Leucolia violiceps (A) Rails, gallinules, and coots Virginia rail Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. Ten species have been recorded in Virginia. *Paint-billed crake, Neocrex erythrops (A) *Clapper rail, Rallus crepitans *King rail, Rallus elegans *Virginia rail, Rallus limicola *Sora, Porzana carolina *Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata *American coot, Fulica americana *Purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinicus (R) *Yellow rail, Coturnicops noveboracensis (R) *Black rail, Laterallus jamaicensis (R) Limpkin Order: GruiformesFamily: Aramidae The limpkin is a large bird in a monotypic family. It is similar in appearance to the rails, but skeletally it is closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes and gets its common name from its appearance of limping as it walks. *Limpkin, Aramus guarauna (A) Cranes Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae Cranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or \\"dances\\". One species has been recorded in Virginia. *Sandhill crane, Antigone canadensis Stilts and avocets Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds which includes the avocets and stilts.

He was closely associated with Galileo Galilei and his disputes with the Catholic Church.  Education and friendship with Galileo  With modest family origins, he was prepared from an early age for a literary career and had a talent for poetry. He was educated at the Universities of Padua and Pisa, where he met Galileo and became his pupil. Their relationship was renewed at the Medici court, where he was among Galileo’s circle of friends.Carmine Jannaco, Martino Capucci, Il Seicento, Piccin, 1986, p. 265 His correspondence with Galileo stretched over many years. In February 1615 he wrote to reassure him that the furore about his Copernican opinions had died down, and 'the Friars don't seem to talk or think about that business any more.' The Crime of Galileo, Giorgio de Santillana, University of Chicago Press 1955, p.114 In 1619, when Galileo published his Discourse on the Comets, Ciampoli warned him that the Jesuits 'were much offended and were preparing to strike back.'The Crime of Galileo, Giorgio de Santillana, University of Chicago Press 1955, p.154  Church and literary career  In 1614, after completing his studies, Ciampoli moved to Rome where he took holy orders. He was soon introduced to the circles of the Roman Curia and when Galileo was first investigated in 1615-16, out of consideration for his loyalty to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, kept up regular communication with his friend Galileo about developments within the senior ranks of the Catholic Church. Thereafter, in 1618, thanks to the good offices of Galileo, he was inducted into the Accademia dei Lincei together with his friend Virginio Cesarini.Giuseppe Gabrieli, Due prelati Lincei in Roma alla corte di Urbano VIII: Virginio Cesarini e Giovanni Ciampoli, in «Atti dell'Accademia degli Arcadi», Roma, 1929-30 In 1621 he was promoted to Secretary of Briefs to Pope Gregory XV and in 1623 he became chamberlain to Pope Urban VIII, whom he had come to know when, as Maffeo Barberini, he had been Cardinal legate to Bologna. With a lively intellect and an amiable character, he maintained an extensive correspondence with many of the scientists of his time, including Ippolito Aldobrandini, Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger, Federigo Borromeo, Giovanni Battista Strozzi the younger, and Evangelista Torricelli. Galileo controversy  Ciampoli read a draft of Galileo’s Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems in 1630, after which he wrote to Galileo assuring him of the Pope’s favourable view. At the same time, he indicated to the Pope that Galileo had faithfully followed the directions he had given him concerning how the book was to be written. His influence was pivotal in ensuring that the book obtained the necessary authorisation of the Church for publication in 1632. This turned to his disadvantage after the book was published, when Urban VIII decided that both Ciampoli and Galileo had deceived him about the book’s arguments.The Crime of Galileo, Giorgio de Santillana, University of Chicago Press 1955, p.192 The Pope also regarded Ciampoli as too sympathetic to radical philosophical ideas espoused by Galileo and others in his circle.In a letter from Niccolini to Cioli, Urban VIII is quoted as saying \\"May God help Ciampoli too, when it comes to the new opinions, for he is also a friend of this new philosophy.\\" Cited in Galileo Heretic, Pietro Redondi, Princeton University Press 1987 p.258 The Pope removed Ciampoli from his office in April 1632 and he left Rome in November of that year.Galileo Heretic, Pietro Redondi, Princeton University Press 1987 p.266  Exile and later years  Before handing over his post as chamberlain to his successor, Monsignor Herrera, Ciampoli had taken care to have two sets of copies made of his diplomatic archives. When he was dismissed he was ordered to leave his copies in his office, but he had already secured the second set of copies, which he took with him together with his large personal archive when he left Rome. This included his books and scientific papers, correspondence with Galileo, and many other works.Galileo Heretic, Pietro Redondi, Princeton University Press 1987 p.267 Ciampoli was exiled first to the town of Montalto delle Marche, where he served as governor, and later to governorships in Norcia (1636), San Severio della Marca (1637), Fabriano (1640), and Iesi. He maintained contact by letter with many important figures, including Cardinal Mazarin and Prince Maurice of Savoy. He also remained in contact with Valerianus Magnus, theologian and philosopher at the court of Władysław IV Vasa, King of Poland. Through his good offices, Ciampoli was appointed official historiographer to the King.Galileo Heretic, Pietro Redondi, Princeton University Press 1987 pp.266-67 When he died in 1643, Ciampoli bequeathed not only four volumes on the history of Poland, but all his manuscripts, including both his scientific and his poetic works, to the King of Poland. He intended his collected archive to be transported to Poland, but before the necessary arrangements could be made, representatives of the Holy Office appeared with a sequestration order, seized everything, and took it to Rome. Of his scientific work and his correspondence with Galileo, no further trace remains. Some of his historical and literary works were passed on to the Barberini and Casanatense libraries and to other collections.

(2016) and Hail Satan? (2019). Filmmaker Magazine named Lane one of “25 New Faces of Independent Film” in 2012. In 2017, she was admitted into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Ella Taylor of NPR described Lane as “one of our foremost chroniclers of bizarro Americana.” Museum of the Moving Image chief curator David Schwartz organized her first major retrospective in 2018, writing \\"in the past few years, Penny Lane has quickly emerged as a major documentary filmmaker.\\" Ann Hornaday wrote that Lane \\"might be documentary film's most compellingly cockamamie social historian,\\" while Chris Plante wrote in The Verge in 2016, \\"Lane is the answer to a question more people should be asking: who's the great documentarian of this generation?\\"  Life and career  Lane was born in Lynn, Massachusetts. She received a BA in American Culture and Media Studies at Vassar College in 2001 and an MFA in Integrated Electronic Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2005. She has taught film, video and new media art at Bard College, Hampshire College, Williams College and Colgate University. Lane became interested in filmmaking and video art when she was working at Children's Media Project, a nonprofit youth media center in Poughkeepsie, New York. Starting in 2002, she has made over a dozen experimental short films which span the worlds of video art and documentary film, including The Abortion Diaries, The Voyagers, Just Add Water and Normal Appearances. Many of her short films are collected and distributed by VTAPE. In 2013, Lane released her first feature-length film Our Nixon. The all-archival documentary featuring the never before seen home movies of Nixon staffers premiered at the 42nd International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2013, had its North American premiere at SXSW, and was selected as the Closing Night Film at New Directors/New Films. It earned wide critical acclaim and numerous film festival awards at Seattle International Film Festival, Ann Arbor Film Festival, Nantucket Film Festival, and Traverse City Film Festival. In 2016, the director's second feature-length film NUTS! a mostly-animated experimental documentary about con-man and quack, John Brinkley, world premiered at Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Special Jury Award for Editing. Lane also released a companion project to NUTS! called Notes on Nuts!, a database of \\"footnotes\\" to the film in which she details over 300 instances of manipulation, tricky editing, and outright fabrications contained within the \\"mostly true\\" story in the film. Lane wrote that the website \\"takes the provocation of the film much further by engaging in a kind of radical honesty about all the tricks, maniupulations and outright lies to be found in my film, with the idea that in doing so I could expand out from this one (admittedly really strange!) case study to instigate a whole new conversation: what would happen if documentary filmmakers started to regularly use footnotes?\\" Lane returned to Sundance in 2019 to premiere her fourth feature-length documentary Hail Satan?, concerning the birth and rapid rise of The Satanic Temple. Critics have often noted Lane's use of humor and unique approach to the documentary form.  Features = Our Nixon  Brian Frye introduced Lane to the Super 8 home movies confiscated by the FBI during the Watergate investigation. The archival footage inspiring Lane and Frye became the basis of the 2013 released nonfiction film Our Nixon, directed by Lane and co- produced by Frye. The documentary depicts a unique portrait of Richard Nixon and his closest aides, chief of staff H.R. Haldeman, domestic affairs adviser John Ehrlichman, and special assistant Dwight Chapin. The film contains footage from 26 hours of Super 8 home movies filmed by Haldeman, Enrlichman, and Chapin, as well as relevant news broadcasts and interviews. Among numerous films about the Nixon and Watergate era, Our Nixon stands out for its distinct, intimate perspective and the stylized all archival editing choice. Our Nixon had its world premiere at the 42nd International Film Festival in Rotterdam and its North American premiere at 2013 South by Southwest. The film screened at multiple film festivals, including Ann Arbor Film Festival, where it won the Ken Burns Award for “Best of the Festival,” and Seattle International Film Festival, where it won the Best Documentary Award. Our Nixon was selected as the Closing Night Film at 42nd New Directors/New Films. On August 1, 2013, CNN broadcast the film, and Cinedigm handled the film's theatrical release. The Wall Street Journal wrote that the \\"highly personal view of the Nixon years is, for obvious reasons, a sad and wrenching one - a film that is nonetheless filled with spirit, humor and a bountiful sense of irony.” Amy Entelis, senior vice president for development for CNN worldwide, praised the film for its “original material” and “unconventional” story telling.  Nuts!  After encountering Charlatan, an authorized biography written by Pope Brock, in her local public library in 2009, Lane developed an interest in John Romulus Brinkley, a doctor who attempted to cure impotence via goat testicle transplantation in 1917. The experimental documentary Nuts! mainly consists of animated reenactments and narration voiced by both actors and Brinkley himself. “Brinkley’s story is not presented as the object of a neutral nonfiction gaze, but opportunity for viewers to actively wrestle with the ethical and epistemological issues central to the narrative nonfiction form,” Lane wrote in the home page of NUTS! Nuts! premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 22, 2016, and won the Special Jury Award for Editing in U.S. Documentary Competition of the festival. The documentary premiered theatrically on June 22, 2016, at Film Forum in New York. Rolling Stone named Nuts! one of the 12 best movies they saw at Sundance 2016, saying “the fact that it’s all true didn’t stop Lane’s film from ending with the best twist of this year’s fest.”  The Pain of Others  Lane's third feature- length documentary The Pain of Others (2018), an all-archival documentary about the controversial illness known as Morgellons, world premiered at International Film Festival Rotterdam and was later screened at BAMcinemaFest, Maryland Film Festival and Sheffield Doc/Fest. The film is composed entirely of YouTube vlogs and does not answer the scientific question of the physiological causes of Morgellons—rather, it focuses on need for human proximity and unexplained suffering of the vloggers, as well as the specific formal and emotional qualities of 2010s era YouTube. Lane has described the film as both \\"YouTube body horror,\\" and a \\"work of media archeology\\" which asks the questions, \\"When doctors send you away, to whom do you turn for help? When suffering has no explanation, what rushes to fill the void? How does false information spread on the internet? If a supportive and loving community forms around a shared delusion, can that be a good thing? What do you do in the face of someone else’s pain if you believe the pain stems from a delusion?\\" Lane was inspired to make the film by reading a 2013 essay in Harpers Magazine by Leslie Jamison describing the phenomenon.  Hail Satan?  An examination of the origins of The Satanic Temple and their brand of grassroots activism. The documentary premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival and is distributed by Magnolia Pictures. Lane described the editing for the film occurred in approximately six months, \\"concurrent with the bulk of shooting.\\"  Short Films = The Abortion Diaries (2005)  “The Abortion Diaries” is a short documentary film released in 2005 which Lane completed as her MFA thesis project at iEAR Studios, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's electronic arts graduate program. The 30 minute documentary was made for approximately $3000 and directed and edited by Lane. It features intimate interviews with 12 women who speak candidly about their experiences with abortion. Critics have written of the film, “[t]hough the conceit is simple, it is also profoundly radical” and described it as “clear-eyed and surprisingly compelling” Part of Lane's research process was to research the history of abortion stories in American popular media (film and TV) and share it publicly on a widely consulted timeline. Lane said she made the film to address a “generational gap in language” around abortion after having an abortion in her early 20s which she found “horrifically isolating” and feeling that her experiences were not represented in the popular media. \\"I felt guilty for not feeling guilty . . . I expected I would suffer a lot. Because I didn't, I felt like a monster.\\" Lane looked \\"literally all over the Internet\\" for advice to help her handle her emotions, but found mainly pro-life literature disguised as unbiased pregnancy resources and pro-choice Web sites that didn't offer much beyond statistics. She made this film to correct the lack of representation and to \\"approach a divisive issue and go beyond bumper stickers.\\" “The Abortion Diaries” was a DIY film primarily self-distributed by the director herself. It became an important organizing and discussion tool, screening at hundreds of colleges, churches, community centers, basements and bars in every US state. It won several awards, including an Audience Award at New Orleans International Human Rights Film Festival, Best Student Documentary at Carolina Film/Video Festival, and Choice USA's “Spirit of Communication” Award.  The Voyagers (2010)  “The Voyagers” is an experimental documentary which tells the story of the NASA project to launch two spacecraft carrying golden records holding a wealth of human culture into space in 1977. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 pioneered research of the far reaches of our solar system and continue to hurtle further into outer space today. In the process of putting together these time capsules of human experience, Carl Sagan and the project's creative director, Annie Druyan, fell in love. Their story resonated with Lane, who created a personal take on it for her own wedding, as a meditation on the nature of love in an uncertain universe. Lane said the film is “a valentine to Carl Sagan and the way that he . . . embodies the place where scientific skepticism meets child-like awe and wonder and joy and optimism.” Brainpickings founder Maria Popova described the film as “a living testament to the creative capacity of remix culture” while critic Collin Souter described it as “a beautiful film, one that never resorts to over-the-top sentiment to make a point about love and the cosmos.” Critic Andrew S. Allen described the film as “a profound story about love and the fearless ability of the human spirit to stand in awe of its vastness, to dream of its mysteries, and to catch a glimpse of it’s incomprehensible complexity, and, knowing what triumphs and heartache lie ahead, still boldly jump in head first.” “The Voyagers” has won many awards, including Best Essay Film (2012 Short of the Week), Best Film (FLEX Film Festival 2011), Winner of the Hammer to Nail Short Film Contest (July 2012). Honorable Mention, Disposable Film Festival (March 2012), Honorable Mention, AFI FEST, Los Angeles (November 2011) and Best Experimental Film, New Orleans Film Festival, NOLA (October 2011).  Controversy  In 2016, Lane discovered that the Tribeca Film Festival was planning to screen Vaxxed, an anti-vaccination documentary directed by Andrew Wakefield. She wrote a widely cited open letter to the festival, originally posted to Facebook and later reposted to Filmmaker Magazine, in which she asked the festival to remove the film from their lineup. In the letter she wrote, \\"the problem is not that Vaxxed is controversial, or even that it’s deceptive. Honestly, I consider a large number of well-made, popular documentary films fairly deceptive. The problem is that it is dangerous misinformation being legitimized under the banner of your considerable prestige.\\" After the ensuing controversy, Tribeca Film Festival eventually removed the film from its lineup.

It operated from the 1950s until at least 1974. During that time period it engaged in illegal activities such as dumping, as well as price and output manipulation with the goal of taking control over the Japanese and American T.V. markets. Its operation halted in the aftermath of a series of investigations conducted by the authorities of the two countries. Background In 1950, the Japanese economy entered a phase of rapid growth which would last until 1973. This period was characterized by a number of protectionist policies including but not limited to the enactment of discriminatory laws towards foreign trade partners, the insulation and oligopolization of capital markets, the bureaucratic allocation of foreign exchange as well as state coordinated acquisition of foreign technology. The adoption of large scale production techniques and foreign know-how, led to a reduction in unit cost, which allowed large companies to expand their operations with the aid of loans from the country's largest banks which were given at sub-equilibrium interest rates. Nevertheless, Japan's leap into industrialization was not matched by the development of its product distribution systems, which remained largely unchanged. Companies reacted to the resulting bottleneck effect in sales by vertically integrating their sales systems, through the creation of informal business groups known as keiretsu. The formation of keiretsu, enabled manufacturers to enter into collusion with distribution companies by fixing the price of the product at an artificially low level, while the distributors' losses were secretly refunded through a system of rebates. Distributors were accordingly rewarded or punished for their cooperation and loyalty. Cartel Beginning its rise in the mid 1950s the Japanese home appliance production increased 25-fold by 1968. Pioneered in Europe and the United States, television technology spread to Japan by means of licensing arrangements and technical assistance from companies such as Westinghouse, Philips, General Electric, Zenith Electronics and Western Electric. The Japanese television market was dominated by seven companies, namely Hitachi, Toshiba, Matsushita, Sony, Sanyo, Sharp and Mitsubishi, who controlled a combined 99.9% of the market share. Facing the aforementioned distribution bottlenecks, television producers began dividing Japan into territories, thereafter assigning wholesalers to each one. With the wholesale industry under their complete control, television companies went on to create an undercover \\"Market Stabilization Group\\" which included the six of the biggest players in the industry excluding Sony. An investigation by the Fair Trade Commission of Japan (FTCJ) uncovered a series of monthly, clandestine meetings, conducted by the higher management echelons of the industry over a period of 15 years. The group admitted to intentionally limiting the profit margin of retailers, minimizing sales to non-affiliated retailers, horizontal price and output manipulation. A further investigation also revealed the existence of a vertical price-fixing scheme between Sony and Matsushita. Despite the findings the FTCJ did not impose major fines or structural adjustments to those involved until the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp. lawsuit was launched in the United States in 1985. Investigation within the US revealed the presence of five interconnected working groups involving all seven of the major Japanese companies, which met from 1964 until at least 1974. The groups, actively shared data on topics such as production, inventory, and shipment sizes. The information was then in ways similar to the ones already implemented in Japan. The cartels maintained an economic policy of increasing prices at the Japanese market while also dumping their products abroad, in an effort to damage their American competitors through predatory pricing. American companies failed to exploit their sudden competitive advantage on the Japanese market, while also suffering heavy losses domestically. The restructuring of the American television market resulted in the exit of 21 companies and the fall of numerous others into Japanese hands. Dumping and the aggressive use of rebates were determined to be forms of customs fraud under the 1921 U.S. Anti-Dumping Act, however. The U.S. Federal agencies such as the International Trade Commission conducted dozens of investigations, resulting in the Japanese-American Orderly Marketing Agreement, which limited the import of Japanese TV sets. In April 1980, the companies involved in the cartel were ordered to pay $66 million; however the collection of the fine was delayed for a significant time period as litigation continued.

Broadly construed, ecological civilization involves a synthesis of economic, educational, political, agricultural, and other societal reforms toward sustainability.Zhihe Wang, Huili He, and Meijun Fan, \\"The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation\\", last modified 2014, Monthly Review, accessed November 1, 2016. Although the term was first coined in the 1980s, it did not see widespread use until 2007, when “ecological civilization” became an explicit goal of the Communist Party of China (CPC).Zhang Chun, \\"China's New Blueprint for an 'Ecological Civilization'\\", last modified September 30, 2015, The Diplomat, accessed November 1, 2016.James Oswald, \\"China turns to ecology in search of ‘civilisation’\\", last modified August 3, 2016, Asian Studies Association of Australia, accessed November 1, 2016. In April 2014, the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and the International Ecological Safety Collaborative Organization founded a sub-committee on ecological civilization.Zhu Guangyao, \\"Ecological Civilization: A national strategy for innovative, concerted, green, open and inclusive development\\", last modified March 2016, United Nations Environment Programme, accessed November 1, 2016. Proponents of ecological civilization agree with Pope Francis who writes, \\"We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.\\" As such, ecological civilization emphasizes the need for major environmental and social reforms that are both long-term and systemic in orientation. History In 1984, former Soviet Union environment experts proposed the term “Ecological Civilization” in an article entitled “Ways of Training Individual Ecological Civilization under Mature Socialist Conditions,” which was published in the Scientific Communism, Moscow, vol. 2.Arran Gare, \\"Barbarity, Civilization and Decadence: Meeting the Challenge of Creating an Ecological Civilization\\", in Chromatikon V: Yearbook of Philosophy in Process, ed. Michel Weber and Ronny Desmet (Louvain-la-Neuve: Presses universitaires de Louvain, 2009): 167. Three years later, the concept of ecological civilization was picked up in China, and was first used by Qianji Ye (1909―2017), an agricultural economist, in 1987. Professor Ye defined ecological civilization by drawing from the ecological sciences and environmental philosophy.Jiahua Pan, China's Environmental Governing and Ecological Civilization (Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag GmbH, 2016), 35. The first time the phrase “ecological civilization” was used as a technical term in an English-language book was in 1995.Jiahua Pan, China's Environmental Governing and Ecological Civilization (Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag GmbH, 2016), 34. The term is found more extensively in Chinese discussions beginning in 2007. In 2012, the Communist Party of China (CPC) included the goal of achieving an ecological civilization in its constitution, and it also featured in its five-year plan.John B. Fullerton, \\"China: Ecological Civilization Rising?\\", last modified May 2, 2015, Huffington Post, accessed November 1, 2016. In the Chinese context, the term generally presupposes the framework of a “constructive postmodernism,” as opposed to an extension of modernist practices or a “deconstructive postmodernism,” which stems from the deconstruction of Jacques Derrida. Both “ecological civilization” and “constructive postmodernism” have been associated with the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead. David Ray Griffin, a process philosopher and professor at Claremont School of Theology, first used the term “constructive postmodernism” in his 1989 book, Varieties of Postmodern Theology.John B. Cobb, Jr., \\"Constructive Postmodernism\\" , 2002, Religion Online, accessed November 1, 2016. See David Ray Griffin, William A. Beardslee, and Joe Holland, Varieties of Postmodern Theology (Albany, State University of New York Press, 1989) A more secular theme that flowed out of Whitehead's process philosophy has been from the Australian environmental philosopher Arran Gare in his book called The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization: A Manifesto for the Future. Arran Gare: \\"The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization: A Manifesto for the Future\\" (Routledge, 2016) The largest international conference held on the theme “ecological civilization” (Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization) took place at Pomona College in June 2015, bringing together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featuring such leaders in the environmental movement as Bill McKibben, Vandana Shiva, John B. Cobb, Jr., Wes Jackson, and Sheri Liao.Herman Greene, \\"Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference\\", last modified August 24, 2015, Center for Ecozoic Societies, accessed November 1, 2016. This was held in conjunction with the 9th International Forum on Ecological Civilization--an annual conference series in Claremont, CA established in 2006. Out of the Seizing an Alternative conference, Philip Clayton and Wm. Andrew Schwartz co-founded the Institute for Ecological Civilization (EcoCiv), and co-authored the book What is Ecological Civilization: Crisis, Hope, and the Future of the Planet, which was published in 2019. Since 2015, the Chinese discussion of ecological civilization is increasingly associated with an “organic” form of Marxism. “Organic Marxism” was first used by Philip Clayton and Justin Heinzekehr in their 2014 book, Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe.\\"Spotlight: Organic Marxism, China's ecological civilization drive in spotlight at int'l conference\\", last modified May 1, 2016, Xinhua News Agency, accessed November 1, 2016. See Philip Clayton and Justin Heinzekehr, Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe (Claremont: Process Century Press, 2014). The book, which was translated into Chinese and published by the People’s Press in 2015, describes ecological civilization as an orienting goal for the global ecological movement.Philip Clayton and Justin Heinzekehr, Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe, trans.

She was originally played by Kendell Nunn from her first appearance on 13 December 2001, until her departure in May 2002. Neighbours marked Nunn's first television role. The character was introduced as Susan Kennedy's (Jackie Woodburne) teenage niece, giving her instant connections within the show. Nunn said Elly had \\"a lot of attitude\\", while she was also billed as being rebellious and spirited. Elly did not like living in Ramsay Street, but she eventually befriends her neighbour Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie). A notable storyline for the character focused on her relationship with her estranged father Ian Conway (Peter Maver). When she gets in contact with Ian, he leads her to believe that Susan's husband Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) is actually her real father. The character was reintroduced on 18 July 2016, with Anasta taking over the role. She was initially contracted for three years and chose not to relocate to Melbourne, where the show is filmed, as her family is based in Sydney. Anasta explained that since Elly's last appearance, she had trained as an English teacher. Elly is now portrayed as a feisty, unpredictable \\"free spirit\\". Anasta also said used her outgoing persona to hide her insecurities. The character's early storylines saw her clash with her student Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) and later Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), when she flirted with Steph's partner Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor). Later storylines saw Elly miscarry after being bitten by a venomous snake, and establish an on-off relationship with Ned Willis (Ben Hall). Elly's housemate Angus Beaumont-Hannay (Jai Waetford) develops an obsessive crush on her and takes advantage of her twice, which almost causes her to lose her job and home. Producers introduced Elly's former boyfriend Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) in March 2017, which led to further exploration of her background. In January 2020, Anasta announced that she would be leaving Neighbours. She filmed her exit scenes in April and Elly made her final appearance on 10 July 2020. Casting On 22 November 2001, Kylie Miller of The Age reported that actress Kendell Nunn had joined the cast as Elly, along with Blair McDonough as Stuart Parker. Neighbours marked Nunn's first television role. The show's producer Peter Dodds told Wendy Granditer of Inside Soap that Elly would have instant ties to the show as she would be introduced as the \\"rebellious niece\\" of Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Nunn made her first appearance as Elly during the episode broadcast on 13 December 2001. Development=Characterisation and introduction Elly was introduced as the teenage daughter of Susan Kennedy's sister, Liz Conway (Christine Keogh). The show's producer Peter Dodds stated that Elly's arrival in Erinsborough would occur at the same as her cousin, Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine), goes into labour in \\"typically trying circumstances.\\" It later emerged that Elly had been expelled from her school after she was caught smoking cannabis. Of Elly, Nunn said \\"She's a great character - she has a lot of attitude and sometimes gets on the wrong side of people.\\" Nunn explained that Elly does not initially like Susan's husband Karl (Alan Fletcher) because she has been without a father figure in her life. She also dislikes being in Ramsay Street. The official Neighbours website described the character as being \\"smart, insightful and just a touch rebellious\\". The writer added that she was a \\"spirited teenager\\". During her time in Erinsborough, Elly befriended her cousin Darcy Tyler (Mark Raffety) and her neighbour Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie). Following the character's reintroduction in 2016, Anasta described the older Elly as \\"fun, feisty\\", unpredictable and wild. She also called Elly \\"a free spirit\\" and thought she was \\"a bit of a tomboy\\". Anasta went on to say that while her character has many layers of naughtiness, she has \\"a heart of gold.\\" Anasta thought Elly was a strong character, who often hides her insecure side with her \\"outgoing, positive personality\\". The actress told Daniel Falconer of FemaleFirst that Elly often goes out to party instead of focusing on her work. Anasta did not think she shared many of Elly's personality traits, such as her flirty and unpredictable side, but she thought that she did have some of Elly's strength. Anasta also compared Elly to her Home and Away character Martha MacKenzie, calling Elly \\"much more troublesome, and manipulative and vindictive than Martha; a lot more fiery and nasty.\\" In the years away from Erinsborough, Elly has become an English teacher, like her aunt Susan. Anasta called Elly's teaching style unconventional, but thought she was \\"naturally gifted\\" at it. Anasta had trouble understanding how Elly manages to balance her job with her personal life, saying \\"I think it's because Elly is smart – she's a naturally good teacher – but she's also lazy and focuses on doing what she wants.\\" Paternity Towards the end of her stay with the Kennedys, Elly decided to meet with her estranged father. Karl tried to help and managed to get in touch with Ian Conway (Peter Maver), as he felt that Elly might settle down if she met with her father. However, Elly soon found out and contacted Ian herself to set up a meeting. When Ian arrived he insisted on having some time alone with Elly. Nunn told an Inside Soap columnist, \\"Once Karl and Susan have left the room, Ian tells Elly that he's not her dad but he knows who is. Then he comes out with it – her real dad is Karl!\\" Ian claims that Karl and her mother had an affair and Elly was born as a result. Elly was horrified by Ian's revelation, but the more she thought about it, the more it made sense. Nunn thought that since Elly and Karl did not get along, part of her did not want it to be true. But because she wanted a family, she hoped that she did belong to Karl. When Elly looked into Karl's background and found out he had previously had an affair, she started to believe that he was her father. However, it was later revealed that Ian really was Elly's biological father. Reintroduction On 28 April 2016, Jonathon Moran of The Daily Telegraph reported that the character would be returning to the show with actress Jodi Anasta in the role. Anasta told Moran that she was \\"thrilled to be working\\" and said that her \\"biggest hurdle\\" was learning all of her scripts. She chose not to relocate to Melbourne, where the show is filmed, as her family is based in Sydney. She initially signed a three-year contract and made her first appearance as Elly on 18 July 2016. Anasta explained that in the character's fictional backstory, she has been living in Bondi and visiting her mother in Sweden. Elly has trained as a schoolteacher and has come to Erinsborough to teach alongside Susan. She thought Elly was different, as she had \\"gone through those young adult years where you test the boundaries.\\" Elly returns to Erinsborough amid the high school formal and clash with Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) over Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns). When Piper sees Elly talking to Tyler, Piper throws a drink over her, before learning Elly is her new English teacher. Of the incident, Anasta explained, \\"It's just some harmless flirting in Elly's eyes. From then on, their relationship is on a downward spiral. So I can tell you Elly won't be making friends with Piper!\\" Elly also got on the wrong side of Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) by flirting with her partner Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor). Anasta said Elly enjoys flirting with Mark, but had no intention of trying to take things further. She enjoys the company of all the Brennan brothers and develops a good friendship with them. Anasta also said that Elly would be accepted eventually, as people get to know her, and she would go on to make friends. Elly moves in with Karl and Susan on Ramsay Street straight away. Anasta was pleased with the way Elly and Susan's relationship is portrayed, saying \\"Susan doesn't necessarily agree with the way Elly goes about things, but she doesn't judge her either.\\" When asked by Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy what Elly and Susan's relationship was like, Anasta replied that they have a very mother/daughter relationship. Elly brings out Susan's \\"spicy side\\" and they have fun together, but Elly can also talk to Susan about her life. She also pointed out that there was an interesting contrast between Elly and Susan's teaching styles. Mark James Lowe of All About Soap observed that Elly appeared to be running away from something, and Anasta said Elly's past would be revealed in due course. She also told the show's official website that Elly had a broken heart and had some \\"personal issues to battle\\". The actress thought it would be \\"a big summer for Elly as she finds her place\\". She added that Elly would leave some fractured relationships in her wake, but she would also form some solid ones. Snake bite and miscarriage Anasta teased Elly's first storyline, saying it would happen quickly and be \\"quite a big tragedy\\". She also said that it would be linked to Elly's past and give the audience more insight into the character. A week after her return, Elly is bitten by a venomous tiger snake on Ramsay Street. Elly had spent the day having several \\"run-ins\\" with Steph and they later begin arguing in the street, where Elly notices Nell Rebecchi (Scarlett Anderson) is about to come into contact with the snake. She manages to pick Nell up and get her out of the way, but the snake bites her instead. Anasta was worried that no one would want to help Elly, as she had upset a few of the other characters since her arrival, but she thought that the event showed them that she is not all bad. She stated, \\"I think what this whole scenario has shown is that Elly does have a good heart. What she did for Nell was quite heroic I think, and shows another side of Elly; that she puts others before herself.\\" Anasta told the show's official website that she enjoyed working with the real snake during the storyline. As Elly is rushed to the local hospital, Karl is waiting to treat her and he knows that the snake's venom could be fatal. However, blood tests also showed that Elly is pregnant. Elly was unaware of her condition and she has very little time to process the news, before Karl tells her that the antidote she needs could harm the baby. Elly is \\"torn\\", as she does not want to risk the baby's health, but Karl tells her she has no choice but to take the antidote, and she allows him to administer it. Shortly after, Elly goes into anaphylactic shock and Karl has to administer some adrenaline too, which increases the pressure on her body, causing Elly to miscarry the baby. Susan offers her support to Elly and when she learns the truth behind Elly's problems, she begins to feel sorry for her. Relationship with Ned Willis When asked what storylines were ahead for Elly, Anasta mentioned that there would be \\"a bit of romance on the cards\\" with a character that was already familiar to viewers. In August, Elly was introduced to Ned Willis (Ben Hall) and they soon go on a date. Following that, Elly decides to play \\"hard to get\\" with Ned, but her aloofness causes him to ask Madison Robinson (Sarah Ellen) out on a date instead of her. This leads Elly to \\"throw her all into the challenge\\" of gaining Ned's attention once more. While looking through Ned's wallet, Elly finds a lock of blonde hair and immediately thinks it belongs to Lauren Turner (Kate Kendall), Ned's former crush and his father's partner. Hall explained that the romance with Elly starts out with lust and is \\"very unstable\\", before it begins to develop into something more long-term. He believed the relationship had potential to be long lasting, but admitted that Ned initially uses it as an opportunity to prove to everyone that he has moved on from Lauren. Hall described Ned and Elly's romance as a \\"passionate, fiery, 'up and down' sort of relationship\\", with the potential for drama. Hall thought the couple were a good match, saying that it was a pairing that did not look like it would work, but that it just did. He also stated that as the characters were such passionate people, when they argued, it was their way of showing that they cared about one another. Ned later breaks up with Elly and warns her to stay away from him, as he will only put her in danger. Feeling rejected, Elly goes to The Waterhole for a drink and meets a stranger, who buys her a drink. When Ned sees them together, he realises the stranger is Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray), the husband of his former lover. Ned realises that Jacka is using Elly as part of his revenge plan and tries to fight him, before deciding to leave town. Ned and Elly are briefly reunited during Hall's third guest stint with the serial, but writers soon decided to end the relationship ahead of his departure. Elly tells Ned that she needs to be single and independent for a time, and Ned accepts her decision, having realised that they just have \\"bad timing.\\" Angus Beaumont-Hannay's crush Singer Jai Waetford (pictured) plays Angus Beaumont-Hannay, who develops an obsessive crush on Elly. When teen character Angus Beaumont-Hannay (Jai Waetford) was reintroduced in September, a new story arc saw him develop a crush on Elly. After he returns to stay at the Kennedy home, Angus \\"takes a clear interest\\" in Elly, but her cousin Ben Kirk (Felix Mallard) warns him off. However, Angus ignores Ben and manages to cause tension between Elly and Ned. Elly becomes aware that Angus has a crush on her, but she does not know how serious his feelings are. Anasta commented, \\"Elly is aware there is some sort of attraction, but definitely not how deep.\\" At the school Halloween dance, Angus sings directly at Elly, leading her to realise that his crush is \\"bordering on obsession.\\" After growing uncomfortable with the attention, Elly returns home early and falls asleep on the couch, where she dreams about kissing Mark Brennan, who she has a crush on, Angus comes home and kisses her, leading Elly to kiss him back, as she thinks it is Mark. Anasta said Elly \\"freaks out\\" when she realises it is Angus kissing her instead. Elly did not think Angus would ever act on his feelings and she feels \\"violated\\" by his actions. Susan becomes suspicious that something has happened between them, but Elly decides to not to tell her about the kiss. Elly does tell her friend Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano), who confronts Angus and warns him away from Elly, leaving Angus \\"mortified\\". Weeks later, Elly warns Angus to be careful after he befriends \\"a bad crowd\\" at his new school. Later that night, Elly receives a phone call from a drunken Angus, who she and Tyler Brennan rescue from a bar in the city. Angus believes that this means she has feelings for him too. Anasta explained that while Elly has been aware of Angus's crush on her, she has not led him on, saying \\"despite her sometimes questionable behaviour, Elly does have a moral compass – especially when it comes to things like this.\\" Elly keeps the incident from Karl and Susan, as she does not want Angus to get into trouble. Anasta called the decision \\"Elly's biggest downfall\\", and she believed that if Elly told Susan what had happened, Susan would be able to help. Anasta also pointed out that Elly stood to lose her job and her home if Angus continued to put her in compromising situations. Elly's former boyfriend Derek Meeps (Scott Tweedie) was later introduced. Angus becomes jealous and tries to stop Elly and Derek from meeting, but fails. Elly spends the afternoon with Derek, and she is \\"delighted\\" when it seems they are reuniting. However, after they have sex, Elly is left \\"deeply upset\\" by his sudden departure. Elly accepts Angus's support and when he kisses her again in her bedroom. Susan catches Angus and she struggles to believe that he was just consoling Elly. Susan reports Elly to the education board and asks her to leave the house. The storyline concluded with Angus's departure from the show. Elly admits to Susan that Angus had taken advantage of her twice, leading the police to question Angus. Elly opts not to press charges against him, after he assures her that he knows his actions were wrong and he will not repeat them. Angus then leaves Erinsborough. Feud with Finn Kelly Elly's former partner Finn Kelly, played by Rob Mills (pictured), was introduced in March 2017. Producers introduced Elly's former boyfriend Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) in March 2017. Ahead of his arrival, it is revealed on-screen that Elly had previously tried to run him down in her car. Anasta explained that following their break-up, Elly got in her car and drove straight at him. She continued, \\"I'd love to say we all have a moment like that – but that's not true! Most of us would hit the brakes. Elly just kept driving, though – so thank God he got out of the way.\\" The actress also explained that Finn was married when he dated Elly, who was unaware he had a wife. Anasta described him as \\"the ultimate charmer and heartbreaker\\", and that because he broke Elly's heart, she is surprised to see him take a job at Erinsborough High. Finn's introduction helped to further explore Elly's background, with scenes showing where Elly came from, and all the manipulation and embarrassment she had endured and overcome because of him. Elly tries to force Finn's resignation from the school, knowing that they cannot work together. When Susan advises her to stay professional, Elly realises that no one will believe her about Finn's \\"darker side\\". The pair later cause a scene at the Back Lane Bar when Elly refuses to forgive him. Following this, Finn takes over Xanthe Canning's (Lilly Van der Meer) tutoring from Elly and gets involved in Ben's career plans too. A message about the incident at the bar is posted online, which Elly suspects is Finn's doing. She fears that he is trying to isolate her, and during a confrontation, Elly pushes Finn away from her and he falls down some stairs in front of Xanthe. The former couple briefly reconcile when Finn \\"turns on the charm\\" and Elly is unable to resist him. However, Finn uses the relationship to undermine Susan's role as principal of Erinsborough High, and further his goal of taking over her job. Of his character's relationship with Elly, Mills said \\"As far as winning Elly back, he can't tell her everything but still wishes she would trust him. He is a bit delusional, I think. He can't be honest, so she doesn't trust him, but he still feels like she should love him. I feel sorry for him in a way.\\" Mills explained that Finn \\"genuinely\\" loves Elly, so he finds it hard when she does not reciprocate. He also thought that as Finn does not have trust, he cannot tell Elly about his brain aneurysm, which has \\"skewed his own sense of reality and morality as well, which is unfortunate because without it he's a good guy – just a slight sociopath.\\" As Finn's storyline continues, he interferes with Susan's multiple sclerosis medication, resulting in her hospitalisation and his promotion to acting principal. He also manipulates Xanthe into keeping quiet, but when the swap is exposed, he tries to flee the country with Xanthe. Finn's brain aneurysm later ruptures, and at the hospital, he continues his downward spiral by claiming that Elly tried to smother him. Departure On 21 January 2020, Anasta confirmed that she would be leaving Neighbours later in the year, so she could return to Sydney to be with her daughter, and pursue other job opportunities. She also felt that her character had run her course, saying \\"She has done absolutely everything, I have had so much fun playing her. She is the most complex, crazy charismatic character in the world and I've gotten to a point with her where I just don't know where to go with her storyline.\\" Anasta began filming her character's exit scenes during the following months. Of her departure, she commented, \\"Four years have just flown by, and for an actor, my character Elly has been an absolute gift. I am so grateful for my time on Neighbours and thrilled that I will be part of the 35th anniversary of the show.\\" She added that Elly would have \\"a brilliant exit storyline\\", which she thought viewers would love. In late March 2020, Neighbours began its planned Easter break one week early amid the Coronavirus pandemic, which changed the emotion of the character's exit storyline. Anasta later confirmed that she would return to Melbourne on 26 April for two weeks to finish filming Elly's exit. During a conversation with co-star Takaya Honda on his YouTube show Tak Talks, Anasta said that scenes had been rewritten to allow Elly to have the goodbye she deserves. The character's exit aired on 10 July 2020, as she moved to Switzerland for a fresh start. Storylines=2001–2002 Elly's mother, Liz Conway, comes to Erinsborough to ask her sister, Susan, to take care of Elly, as she is going to Sweden for six months. Elly arrives in Ramsay Street, accompanied by the police. She forms a bond with her cousin Darcy Tyler, but she struggles to get along with Susan's husband Karl. Susan faces a dilemma when she realises Elly thinks she is only staying for a couple of weeks, instead of six months. Darcy decides to tell her the truth, but Elly does not believe him and she is devastated when her friend, Michelle Scully confirms the news. Elly believes that she is getting a ticket to Stockholm, when her mother tells her to expect something in the post. However, she is disappointed when she receives a credit card. Elly then books herself on a flight to see her mother, but Susan manages to stop her from leaving. Elly forms a close relationship with Michelle, although they get off to a bad start when Michelle accuses Elly of cheating with her boyfriend, Zack Shaw (Owen Lee). Zack starts spreading rumours about Michelle and she teams up with Elly to get back at him. They write rumours about him on the blackboard, but they are soon caught. Elly stands up for Michelle, straining her relationship with Karl and Susan. Elly informs Karl and Susan that she intends to move out when she turns sixteen. She changes her mind after listening to Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) talk about family. Elly saves Darcy from the sudden effects of a heart problem, by giving him CPR. Elly is hailed a hero and she is given some work experience at the surgery. Elly briefly dates Tad Reeves (Jonathon Dutton). Karl and Susan decide to find out who Elly's father is, so they can give her some stability. Elly tracks down Ian Conway, who she believes is her father. Ian shocks Elly when he tells her that he had been informed Karl was her father. Elly asks Libby Kennedy if her father had ever had an affair and Libby admits that he did. Elly confronts Karl, but he tells her that he never had an affair with Liz. Elly is disappointed. Liz returns and reveals she is pregnant. She also admits that Ian is Elly's father, and that she had lied to him. Elly is devastated by her mother's neglect, especially when Liz forgets her birthday. When Liz asks Elly to come to Sweden with her, Elly is unsure, but decides to give her mother a second chance. She and Liz then leave for Sweden. 2016–2020 Fourteen years later, Elly returns to Erinsborough amid the high school formal. She flirts with Mark and Tyler Brennan. When Piper Willis sees Elly with Tyler, she becomes jealous and throws a drink over her. Piper is forced to apologise to Elly, who is revealed to be her new English teacher. Piper continues to be hostile towards Elly and later upsets her, causing Elly to almost hit Stephanie Scully and her son with her car. Mark is lenient towards her and Steph, who is dating Mark, becomes jealous of their friendship. Elly rescues Nell Rebecchi from a snake, but is bitten herself. Karl informs Elly that she is pregnant. However, she suffers an allergic reaction and miscarries the baby. Her former boyfriend offers no sympathy when Susan contacts him. Elly meets Ned Willis and they develop a relationship. Piper makes a formal complaint against Elly after she insults her. Susan finds that Elly has been marking Piper down, leading her to place Elly on probation. Elly undergoes counselling and she apologises to Piper. Elly and Ned's relationship is strained when his former girlfriend Regan Davis (Sabeena Manalis) comes to him for help, and he takes her out of town to protect her from her husband Jacka Hills. Ned returns to see Jacka with Elly at The Waterhole, and they fight. Ned soon leaves town to get away from Jacka. Karl and Susan's teenage house guest Angus Beamont-Hannay develops a crush on Elly and kisses her while she is sleeping. Elly keeps the incident a secret, while telling Angus that nothing can happen between them. Elly's former boyfriend Derek Meeps visits and they have sex, leaving Elly to think they are getting back together, but Derek reveals he is engaged and expecting a baby. Elly gets drunk and Angus helps her to bed, where he kisses her again. Susan finds them together and reports Elly to the educational board. Elly tells Susan that Angus took advantage of her twice and he is questioned by the police. He apologises to Elly, before he leaves town. Ned returns for his father's wedding and he and Elly reconcile. Ned is arrested for arson and Elly agrees to give him a character reference. Ned persuades her to stay in Erinsborough and Elly tells him that she deliberately drove her car at a man she was dating during a heated confrontation. Elly's former boyfriend, Finn Kelly, becomes a teacher at Erinsborough High. Elly asks him to leave, but briefly reconciles with him. When Susan's medication is switched causing her to be hospitalised, Elly blames Finn, but no one believes her. Elly enters Finn's motel room looking for evidence, and she is suspended when Finn is appointed acting principal. Finn's crimes are eventually exposed when he tries to leave the country with Elly's student Xanthe Canning. Elly admits that she has feelings for Mark, and they begin a relationship, which Elly ends when she learns her friend Paige Smith also has feelings for Mark. Elly and Paige's friendship is strained when Paige and Mark get back together. Following Paige's departure, Mark kisses Elly, but she refuses to be his rebound girlfriend. Elly goes on a date with Amy Williams' (Zoe Cramond) former husband Liam Barnett (James Beck). Amy gives them her blessing to pursue a relationship, however, Elly decides to put her friendship with Amy first and ends things with Liam. Elly's younger sister Bea Nilsson (Bonnie Anderson) comes to Erinsborough and Elly attempts to reconnect with her. Elly encourages Bea to apply for a job at the local garage, and stands up for her when Mark accuses Bea of inputting the wrong figures on the invoices. When Mark tells Elly how he feels about her, she kisses him and then tells him that he has to earn her love, which he does. Elly becomes suspicious about Bea's boyfriend Patrick, after Bea reveals they are getting married. Later that day, Elly receives a text from Bea, asking her to come to the national park. Elly's car is stolen and used in a hit-and-run on Xanthe. Elly insists that she was not the driver, but she is arrested and charged. While trying to locate Bea, Elly and Susan find her car and come face to face with Finn, who reveals that he is Patrick and the perpetrator of the hit-and-run. Finn locks them all in a shipping container and Bea blames Elly for ruining her life. Elly collapses due to dehydration just as they are found by Mark and Karl. Elly convinces Bea to move into Number 28, while Susan informs them that she has invited their mother Liz to Erinsborough. Both Elly and Bea confront Liz about Bea's departure when she was younger. Liz admits that she wanted Bea gone, as she reminded Liz too much of her father, Lars. Elly and Bea want Liz to leave, but let her stay when she claims that Finn robbed her. They soon learn that Liz made the story up, after she fell over while drunk, and Liz leaves. Elly and Bea grow closer and Elly offers her support when she realises that Bea is dyslexic. Elly bonds with Mark's sister Chloe Brennan (April Rose Pengilly), who confides in her about her relationship with businessman Pierce Greyson (Tim Robards). Elly, Susan, and Xanthe learn that Bea has gone to find Finn at a cabin in the bush and go after her. They run into Bea and then Finn, who taunts them on a cliff top. Finn is pushed over the cliff by Susan, after he threatens Bea's life. Chloe calls Elly for help after she runs away from Pierce. Elly urges Chloe not to leave the country and tell her brothers about her relationship with Pierce. Chloe also tells her family that she has Huntington's disease, and Mark takes a test to see if he has it too. Jane Harris (Annie Jones) becomes acting principal at Erinsborough High and quickly comes into conflict with Elly. When Elly breaks the new rule about going off site, Jane fires her, claiming that she needs to lose a member of staff due to low enrolment levels. Chloe comforts Elly and kisses her. While waiting for Mark's test results at the hospital, Elly proposes to him and he accepts. During their engagement party, Chloe declares her love for Elly, but later tells her that she is always affectionate when she is drunk. Elly later reads a Christmas card from Chloe in which she admits that she is in love with her. She also learns Liz knew about the card and warned Chloe to back off. Elly, Chloe and a number of cafe customers are held hostage by Raymond Renshaw (Frank Magree). The incident brings Chloe and Elly together as they support one another. Elly encourages Chloe to talk with her former girlfriend Melissa Lohan (Jacqui Purvis), after she moves to Erinsborough. Mel soon learns about the kiss between Elly and Chloe, but promises to keep it from Mark. When Chloe and Mel reconcile, Elly expresses her concerns about Mel's intentions. After their friend and neighbour Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) reveals that she has ovarian cancer, Mark keeps his feelings to himself and shuts Elly out. She soon discovers that he is visiting the graveside of his former fiancée, and asks him to talk to her. After Sonya dies, Mark leaves town for a while and later calls off the wedding via text message. Chloe comforts Elly, who kisses her and they have sex. Mark soon returns home and apologises to Elly, before asking her to marry him. Elly and Mark marry, but she tells him that she cheated on him with Chloe during the reception. Chloe tells Elly that she loves her, but Elly rejects her, telling her that their night together was a mistake and that her heart belongs to Mark. Elly attempts to talk to Mark, but he refuses to listen to her and asks her for an annulment. Elly discovers she is pregnant and tells Mark. They reconcile, but Elly soon learns from the doctor that she had a false positive and is not pregnant. Leo advises her to keep quiet and try and get pregnant as soon as possible, however, Mark struggles to be intimate with Elly and rejects her advances. She goes out drinking and has a one-night stand with Shaun Watkins (Brad Moller), which results in her pregnancy. Mark later apologises for rejecting her and asks that they resume sleeping in the same bed. Elly learns Shaun is Finn's brother at the sentencing hearing. Shaun realises he is the father of Elly's baby and uses it to blackmail her into changing her victim impact statement, and convincing the Kennedys to house Finn. Susan offers Elly her job back at the school, where she clashes with student Dean Mahoney (Harry Strand). With Leo's help, Elly manages to avoid having a twelve-week scan with Mark in attendance. He later catches her looking at his unborn daughter's ultrasound picture and assumes it is their baby, so Elly does not correct him. She later confides in Dr Dora Dietrich (Kirsty Hillhouse) about the paternity of her baby. Dean soon reveals that he is Dr Dietrich's son and has read Elly's file, leading him to blackmail her. Finn later works out that Shaun is the father of Elly's baby, but agrees to keep it a secret. Elly suffers a placental abruption after she is pushed over at school. Elly eventually tells Mark the truth about Shaun and the baby. She moves back to the Kennedys' and tells her family about the baby's paternity and why she asked them to house Finn. Shaun returns to town and asks to be a part of his baby's life. As he and Elly bond, Mark serves Elly with annulment papers, which she signs. When she learns that Mark has not filed the papers, she hopes they can reconcile. They share a kiss, and Shaun leaves town so they can have space, but Mark ultimately decides to end their marriage and files the papers. Elly and Chloe reconcile their friendship and Chloe stands up for Elly when a student taunts her about Dean. Elly and Chloe go on a date, where Elly admits that she feels overwhelmed, but Chloe assures her that she does not need to label herself and they end the date with a kiss. Elly discovers that Bea is in a relationship with Finn and voices her disapproval, though she relents when she sees Finn help Bea with her dyslexia. When Chloe calls Elly her girlfriend, Elly reminds her that she needs them to take things slowly. Chloe breaks up with Elly and they agree to remain friends. However, Elly constantly texts Chloe to arrange outings, which leads to Pierce confronting Elly and telling her that it is causing Chloe pain. As Elly walks away, she slips and falls on her stomach, but the baby is okay. Elly takes her friends Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) and David Tanaka (Takaya Honda) to a birthing class, and continues to involve themselves in her pregnancy, which concerns Finn, who feels that Shaun is being left out. Elly goes to Sydney for a few days to spend time with her mother. She returns after Bea is hospitalised following an electric shock. Shaun supports her and asks her to start a romantic relationship with him, which she rejects. David later finds Shaun has some legal documents regarding custody arrangements, and when Elly confronts him, he tells her that his mother had them drawn up and they burn them. As Shaun helps Elly clear up the school after the formal, they share a romantic moment and later kiss. Mark leaves Elly a goodbye message as he plans to leave Erinsborough, but Elly seeks him out at the lake to talk and they say their goodbyes in person. Shaun returns to Switzerland and goes missing in an avalanche. He is presumed dead and Elly and Finn rely on each other for support. Bea helps them by holding a memorial for Shaun by the lake. When Finn violates his parole to bring Elly some pain medication at the school, he scares a student who later goes missing. Elly takes the blame and is fired. Finn offers her financial support and they grow closer. Finn finds and holds onto an old photo album of Elly's from when they were a couple. Susan notices the growing bond between Finn and Elly, as does Finn's mother Claudia Watkins (Kate Raison), who tells Bea. Elly and Finn reassure her that nothing is going on between them. However, their feelings for each other grow stronger after Finn helps Elly give birth to her daughter Aster Conway (Isla Goulas; Scout Bowman), while she is being held hostage by Robert Robinson (Adam Hunter). Susan catches the two having a romantic moment in their backyard and confronts them. Knowing she can not hurt Bea, Elly begs Susan not to tell her and decides to move into Number 32. But she is forced to call Finn over when she struggles to settle Aster. Bea contacts Finn's father Trent Kelly (Peter Houghton), much to the Finn's chagrin. Elly comforts Finn when he discovers that his father intended to pay the ransom to rescue him when he was held hostage in Colombia, but ended up gambling the money. Elly and Finn kiss after Aster's naming ceremony, and Finn later tells her that he loves her. Finn, Elly, Bea, Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney), Chloe, Pierce, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) and Roxy Willis (Zima Anderson) head to Pierce's island for Elly's 35th birthday. Finn tells Elly that he and Bea have broken up and she has gone to Sydney, but Elly becomes suspicious when her mother tells her Bea has not turned up at her home and Chloe informs her that she and Finn had a confrontation. Finn offers to accompany Elly to Sydney, but when she finds Bea and Toadie's phones in Finn's backpack, she realises he has been deceiving her. She flees with Aster, with Finn chasing after her. Elly finds Gary Canning's (Damien Richardson) body and realises Finn has killed him. Finn eventually corners her, kidnaps Aster, and pushes Elly into a mineshaft where Bea and Harlow Robinson (Jemma Donovan) are. He then sets the island on fire before leaving. Elly, Bea, Harlow are rescued when Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) finds an injured Toadie, and tells the others on the island of Bea's whereabouts. Upon reaching the mainland, Elly goes to find Finn, Susan and Aster in the Snowy Mountains. After rescuing them, she tells Susan that she is going to make sure Finn cannot hurt them anymore. She finds Finn has drowned in a makeshift grave he was digging for Susan. As the police arrive, she is seen attempting to bury Finn's body and is later charged with his murder. The charges are downgraded to voluntary manslaughter in a plea deal to avoid a custodial sentence, but Finn's mother Claudia blackmails the judge into giving her a three-year sentence, so she can gain custody of Aster. Elly befriends Andrea Somers (Madeleine West) in prison when Andrea helps save her and Aster during a riot. However, she soon realises that Andrea is scheming to get her son back and warns Toadie and Andrea's sister Dee Bliss (Madeleine West). Andrea has her beaten up and later arranges a fight between her and another inmate. Elly is saved when she is called to the governor's office and told that she is being released, after Claudia's blackmail is found out. Elly is reunited with Aster and Shaun, who was recently rescued. Elly is initially reluctant to leave the house following her ordeal in prison, but Shaun encourages her attend Aster's vaccinations at the hospital. Shaun struggles to understand Finn's actions and decides to return to Switzerland to seek help. He returns a few weeks later and helps Elly when she is hassled by a journalist. He also supports her when she is rejected by a mother's group because of her history with Finn. Elly and Shaun have sex and begin a relationship. He later asks her to move to Switzerland with him. Elly's sentence for voluntary manslaughter is reduced to time served, and she is no longer allowed to teach. Toadie offers to get her and Aster some visas if they decide to leave the country, and Shaun tells her that he is considering taking over the family business. Elly agrees to move with Switzerland with him, but puts off telling Bea, leading to a confrontation when she does find out. Bea asks Elly to stay, as she needs her, but Elly says that she needs a fresh start. Karl and Susan return home from their holiday early to say their goodbyes. Bea decides not to accompany Elly to the airport and they say goodbye at the house, before Karl and Susan drive Elly, Aster and Shaun out of Ramsay Street. Reception Ahead of her introduction, Kylie Miller of The Age branded Elly a \\"likeable delinquent.\\" Michael Idato of The Sydney Morning Herald criticised Nunn's acting ability and her debut performance on Neighbours, writing that he was \\"rendered speechless\\" by her poor performance. Idato went on to say that her arrival was \\"so thoroughly underwhelming and her delivery so off the mark\\" that no one noticed McDonough's introduction during the same episode. He also dubbed Elly a \\"hybrid of the brazen-hussy- troublemaker and dumped-by-a-disinterested-mum character types that seem to reproduce like rabbits on soaps.\\" Observing Elly's behaviour, a Liverpool Echo reporter commented, \\"Stand well back – Elly is about to fly off the handle.\\" Roz Laws, writing for the Sunday Mercury, dubbed Elly a \\"troublesome teen\\". A writer for the BBC said Elly's most notable moment from her first stint was \\"Asking Karl if he was her real father.\\" When Elly was bitten by the snake, Phillip Portman of the Daily Star quipped \\"Only on Neighbours can someone arrive in Ramsay Street and a week later, be fighting for their life.\\" Portman also dubbed the character \\"promiscuous\\". A TV Week contributor observed, \\"It hasn't been the smoothest introduction to Ramsay Street for newcomer Elly.\\" Kate MacCarthy of the Radio Times wondered if Elly and Ned were \\"set to be the cutest new couple in Ramsay Street?\\" While Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap observed \\"it's clear from the get-go that this is going to be an interesting relationship given that both Ned and Elly are a little on the mischievous side!\\" A reporter for the Liverpool Echo noted that the school Halloween dance was \\"aptly horrific for Elly\\" when Angus sang to her.

Scheppele was at the University of Michigan from 1984 to 1996, and was an Arthur F. Thurnau Professor from 1993 until her departure for Penn. She received her PhD in sociology from the University of Chicago (1985) and her A.B. in urban studies from Barnard College (1975). Scheppele is an expert on authoritarian regimes, as well as Hungarian and Poland's politics and law. Scheppele worked in Hungary in the 1990s, during which she met Viktor Orbán. During the socialist- liberal coalition government of Gyula Horn, she was a researcher at the Constitutional Court and served as an expert advisor to the constitutional drafting committee of the Hungarian Parliament in 1995-1996.https://www.csce.gov/sites/helsinkicommission.house.gov/files/Testimony%20Scheppelle.pdf She was the foundingLaw and Society Association Co-Director of the MA Program in Gender and Culture at Central European University, when the program was first accredited.Hungary in the Spotlight: The Unconstitutional Constitution  Central European University She does not speak Hungarian.About Hungary - The Hungary 'expert' made this same claim four years ago Now a leading critic of the right-wing Viktor Orbán government, she has called its actions as creating an \\"unconstitutional constitution,\\", and that Hungarian democracy is in jeopardy. She called Tünde Handó a \\"judicial Czar\\" whose role damaged the independence of the Hungarian judiciary. Scheppele also called a proposed constitutional rewrite in 2013 \\"a toxic waste dump of bad constitutional ideas\\", which prompted Fidesz MEP György Schöpflin to attack her claims on the basis of political animosity.

December, 2017 in an interview in the Hungarian weekly, HVG, Scheppele stated that an opposition cooperation is needed to bring down the Orbán-regime in the 2018 Hungarian elections, but the leftist opposition parties are divided, and it is possible that the Fidesz-government blackmails some of the socialist politicians. The only party which could put an end to the Orbán regime is the Jobbik, and she expressed her disapproval of the government attacks on this party.

It defended the Midlands and North West of England and Wales during the Blitz and the middle years of World War II. Origin AA Command had been created in 1938 to control the Territorial Army's rapidly-expanding anti-aircraft (AA) organisation within Air Defence of Great Britain. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, it commanded seven AA Divisions, each with several AA Brigades, disposed around the United Kingdom.Pile's despatch.Routledge, p. 65.Farndale, p. 5.Robert Palmer, A Concise History of Anti-Aircraft Command (History and Personnel) at British Military History. Continued expansion made this organisation unwieldy, so in November 1940 – during the Luftwaffe's nightly Blitz on London and other British cities – five further AA Divisions were organised, and all the divisions grouped under three corps headquarters directly subordinate to AA Command. II AA Corps covered the Midlands and North West of England and North Wales, and by February 1941 comprised four AA divisions and 14 brigades.

The corps was responsible for large Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) around Merseyside, Humberside and South Yorkshire, and the North and West Midlands, with 'Indicator Belts' and 'Killer Belts' of searchlights in between, the former working with the GDAs and RAF Sectors, the latter with the night fighters in the air. Redeployment was called for in 1942 when the Luftwaffe began the 'Baedeker raids' on towns and cities such as Norwich, King's Lynn and York that had previously warranted little AA defence.Routledge, pp. 387–404 & Map 35. Disbandment The AA Corps and Divisional HQs were disbanded in October 1942 and a replaced by a more flexible system of AA Groups, each aligned with a Group of RAF Fighter Command.

It defended Scotland, Northern Ireland and North East England during the Blitz and the middle years of World War II. Origin AA Command had been created in 1938 to control the Territorial Army's rapidly- expanding anti-aircraft (AA) organisation within Air Defence of Great Britain. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, it commanded seven AA Divisions, each with several AA Brigades, disposed around the United Kingdom.Pile's despatch.Routledge, p. 65.Farndale, p. 5.Robert Palmer, A Concise History of Anti-Aircraft Command (History and Personnel) at British Military History. Continued expansion made this organisation unwieldy, so in November 1940 – during the Luftwaffe's nightly Blitz on London and other British cities – five further AA Divisions were organised, and all the divisions grouped under three corps headquarters directly subordinate to AA Command. III AA Corps covered North Eastern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and by February 1941 comprised four division-level headquarters and 11 brigades. Its boundaries roughly coincided with No. 13 Group and No. 14 Group of RAF Fighter Command.Routledge, p. 394.Frederick, p. 1047.

In August 1942, the 3rd AA Division HQ was sent south to assist in defending the South Coast of England against 'hit and run' attacks by the Luftwaffe.Routledge, pp. 402–3. Disbandment The AA Corps and Divisional HQs were disbanded in October 1942 and a replaced by a more flexible system of AA Groups. The area covered by III AA Corps became the responsibility of two of the new groups: 6th AA Group (North East England and Scotland) and 7th AA Group (Northern Ireland); OSDEF remained directly subordinate to AA Command.Routledge, p. 401 & Map 36.

Editions from Hachette in India in 2013 and Jacana in South Africa in 2014 followed. The book is a biography of Sujaria, the great-grandmother of the author and simultaneously an exploration of the indentured labor system, which was practiced in the Caribbean. Tracing Sujaria's 1903 journey as a Brahmin caste woman from Bihar, India's poorest state, to the sugarcane plantations of British Guiana, Bahadur wove both archival and published records, as well as folk and oral sources, to tell the broader story of \\"the exodus and settlement of Indian women to the Caribbean\\". She critically examined the Hindu caste system, Indian family structure, and the indenture system itself in an attempt to understand how each of these shaped her grandmother and how migration changed or affected women's lives. The word coolie, which throughout the British Empire referred to indentured workers from Asia, is considered a pejorative. Bahadur chose the title to acknowledge the stigma but also as a metaphor for the baggage women carried as a result of colonialism. Reviewers have pointed to the importance the work holds for a \\"neglected area of scholarship\\", about the age when Asian indentured workers replaced African slaves on plantations in the Caribbean, as well as its exploration of feminist themes of societal and family oppression, poverty, lack of power, sexual abuse and violence. Praised for her storytelling, as well as academic treatment, the book has appeal for both scholars and casual readers. Coolie Woman was shortlisted for multiple literary awards, including the Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature (2014) and the Orwell Prize in Britain (2014). https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/24/orwell-prize-shortlist-thatcher- biography-charles-moore It won the 2014 Caribbean Studies Association's Gordon K. and Sybil Lewis Prize, which annually recognizes interdisciplinary works that examine Caribbean culture and society, have been published within the preceding three years, and are written in one of the languages prevalent in the region.

Established in 1903 as the Mason Memorial Hospital, it was the first modern hospital in the country and, possibly, along the entire Persian Gulf region. Today, the hospital offers round-the-clock specialist medical & dental services and operates two satellite clinics in the country. History The origins of the hospital can be traced back to 1888, with the establishment of an Arabian missionary service by the theological seminary of the Dutch Reformed Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In the 1890s, the arrival of the American missionary Samuel Zwemer, James Cantine, and the Australian missionary Amy Wilkes to Bahrain saw the initiation of basic medical services in a mission house, a precursor to the establishment of the hospital. The first Western- trained resident doctors, doctors Sharon Thoms and Marion Wells (a husband- and-wife team), later arrived in 1900. In 1901, the Hakim of Bahrain Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa helped purchase land for construction of a hospital complex to replace the mission house. With sufficient donations from the Mason family in New York, the mission constructed the 24-bed Mason Memorial Hospital in 1902 and officially opened it on January 26, 1903. Soon after the hospital opened, it began to attract patients from across the Persian Gulf; from places like Qatif, al-Hasa, Oman, Qatar, Najd and Bushire. By 1924, the hospital had 33,000 outpatients and 600 inpatients a year, with an average of 100 patients being treated a day. Throughout the hospital's history, the majority of healthcare workers in the hospital were employed from Western countries or India although many Bahrainis were also recruited and trained in the medical sciences. In 1962, the hospital expanded by opening two new buildings in central Manama and renamed itself the American Mission Hospital that same year. The expansion was opened by the Emir of Bahrain Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa. On the brink of closing in the 1980s, the hospital revamped its services by offering 24-hour services, opening new specialised ENT and orthopaedic clinics and constructing a suspended bridge connecting two hospital buildings across a road. In 2000, the hospital opened a satellite clinic in Saar, on the western side of Bahrain, offering dental and medical services. In 2014, another clinic was opened in Amwaj Islands, to the northeast of Manama.

He painted it in 1882 in oil on canvas with a height of 64.5 cm and a width of 52.1 cm.The size 64.5 x 52.1 cm is mentioned in Österreichische Galerie (editor): Französische Kunst in der Österreichischen Galerie in Wien, Sammlungskatalog der Galerie des 19. Jahrhunderts, p. 106. However, the dimensions of 65 x 52 cm are given by Bärbel Holaus, Elisabeth Hülmbauer and Claudia Wöhrer: Kunst des 19. Jahrhunderts. Bestandskatalog der Österreichischen Galerie des 19. Jahrhunderts, p. 99. It shows the chef and owner of a restaurant and hotel Paul Antoine Graff, who was the landlord of Monet during his visit to Pourville on the English Channel. It is part of the collections exhibited at Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in Vienna, Austria.  Description Monet painted a portrait of the chef Paul Antoine Graff wearing his white chef's hat and jacket. In the lower part of the painting, the figure fades into the light grey background, resulting in an oval shaped composition. Monsieur Paul has turned his head towards his right shoulder and looks into the direction of the left edge of the painting. His dark eyes do not focus on anything specific, and he appears to look just ahead of himself into the emptiness.Melissa MacQuillan: Porträtmalerei der französischen Impressionisten, p. 168. His scrubby grey and black full beard is part of his appearance and nearly covers the protruding chin and the mouth with closed lips. The furrowed face was painted by Monet with strong strokes of his paintbrush, and the nose was emphasised by a more pronounced shade of the same colours. The art critic Melissa MacQuillan sees in his face his pride and the firmness of his character. Monet described the painting as a esquisse curieuse (curious sketch).Österreichische Galerie: Französische Kunst in der Österreichischen Galerie in Wien, Sammlungskatalog der Galerie des 19. Jahrhunderts, p. 106. Monet created a painting full of livelyness by the tilted hat, the scrubby beard and the characteristic facial features. He used a clever colour scheme, in which the dark beard builds a contrast to the white clothes and in which the reddish and brown skin colour is complementary to the light blueish grey shades of the background. The painting is clearly signed with \\"Claude Monet 82\\" in the top right corner.Bärbel Holaus, Elisabeth Hülmbauer and Claudia Wöhrer: Kunst des 19. Jahrhunderts. Bestandskatalog der Österreichischen Galerie des 19. Jahrhunderts, p. 99.  Portrait of a host  Monet arrived at Pourville on 15 February 1882 and painted the landscape of the Normandy coast during the subsequent couple of months. He lived there at the Hotel A la Renommée des Galettes, which was affiliated to a restaurant. The owner was the Alsatian chef Paul Antoine Graff (1823–1893), locally known as Le Père Paul, whose special dish was galettes, i.e. Breton crusty cakes. This reputation was reflected in the name of the hotel. On a later occasion, these puff pastry cakes were also featured in Monet's still life Les Galettes (private collection). On the day of his arrival he described in a letter to his companion/housekeeper Alice Hoschedé his regret that he hadn't come earlier to Pourville. He described Père Paul as an excellent chef and was pleased with his accommodation: \\"The landscape is very beautiful … one couldn't be nearer to the sea, as I am now, directly on the beach, the waves reach up to the basement of our house.\\"Cited from Melissa MacQuillan: Porträtmalerei der französischen Impressionisten, p. 168. Apart from the portrait of Monsieur Graff Monet also painted a portrait of Madame Graff. The painting La Mère Paul (Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts) shows Madame Graff in dark clothes joined by her loyal terrier Follette. Both paintings of the Graff couple were probably created as Monet's recognition of their hospitality. Claude Monet - Les Galettes.jpgClaude Monet: Les Galettes, 1882 Monet - Eugénie Graff (Madame Paul), 1882.jpgClaude Monet: La Mère Paul, 1882 Portrait of Père Paul and La Mère Paul are two of the few portraits that Monet painted after the death of his first wife Camille in 1879. Other paintings are those of his son Michel Monet Wearing a Bobble Hat in 1880 and his self-portraits of 1886 and 1917. Apart from paintings of the Graffs and his own family, Monet also painted a portrait of the fisherman Poly (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris) in 1886. The fisherman Poly with his full beard and the characteristic facial features shows some resemblance to Père Paul as shown in the Portrait of Père Paul. Melissa MacQuillan noted in the Graff portrait and in the painting of Poly a nearly physiognomic exaggeration, which reminds one of his early works as a caricaturist in his youth. The art critic Richard R. Brettell also draws a comparison between the Portrait of Père Paul and the ironic drawings of Monet's adolescence.Richard R. Brettell: Impression, painting quickly in France, 1860–1890, p. 96. Several of these caricatures exist from the late 1850s, for instance the painting Mario Uchard (Art Institute of Chicago).

After Graff's death it came in 1899 via the Paris branch of the art dealer Knoedler into the possession of the gallerist Paul Durand-Ruel. He lent the painting in 1903 to the exhibition Development of the Impressionism in Painting and SculptureEntwicklung des Impressionismus in Malerei und Plastik of the Vienna Secession, at which also its pendant Madame Paul was shown. Subsequently the Portrait of Père Paul was acquired by the Moderne Galerie, the predecessor of today's Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.Daniel Wildenstein: Monet: catalogue raisonné, Bd.

His major excavation sites were Bulla Regia (from 1965 to 1985) and the on the Palatine Hill in Rome (from 1986 to 1997). Continuing the excavations he conducted at Bulla Regia, he devoted much of his research to Roman Africa and the architecture of Roman baths, topic of his State thesis. He also devoted much of his work to the study of social and cultural mechanisms of ancient history, offering a critical analysis of the concepts of romanization or conquest, from the analysis of social hierarchies rather than cultural hyphenation.

century"},{"id":"52163605","text":"Colonel Edward William Purvis (July 4, 1857 – August 16, 1888) was a British army officer and settler of the Kingdom of Hawaii who served as Vice- Chamberlain during the reign of King Kalākaua. After resigning from the royal household, Purvis published two political satires aimed at undermining the image of the king and his prime minister, Walter M. Gibson, who had been responsible for the removal of Purvis' superior. These actions and other factors led to the demise of the Gibson regime and the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Purvis died in the following year, after going to the United States to seek medical attention for his health. According to popular legend, he was an expert player of the Portuguese machete or cavaquinho and was believed to be the inspiration for the name of the Hawaiian ukulele. Early life Purvis was born on July 4, 1857, into a family of Scottish descent. His parents were Robert Raaf Purvis and Annie Silburn Marshall. His paternal grandfather, William Purvis, who worked as a trader and ship captain, had settled in the Dutch East Indies in the 1810s while it was still part of the British Empire. The family lived in many places including Dutch East Indies, Brussels, and London. Educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Edward William Purvis served as a sub-lieutenant of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot in Bengal, where he learned Hindi, and later as a sub-lieutenant for the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot in Chatham, Kent. Around 1879 he resigned his British Army post and traveled to the Hawaiian Islands, where his father and older brother Robert William Theodore Purvis had already settled, having arrived on December13, 1877; his brother Theodore had started a sugar plantation business on the island of Kauai.; ; ; ; A distant cousin of theirs was William Herbert Purvis, known for introducing macadamia nuts to Hawaii. Career in Hawaii Purvis standing on far right with Hawaiian Army Colonels James Harbottle Boyd, Curtis P. Iaukea and Charles Hastings Judd on the steps of the ʻIolani Palace, 1882 Purvis settled in Honolulu around 1879. On August26, 1882, he was created a major in the Hawaiian military and appointed as military instructor. He was also appointed as King Kalākaua's Vice-Chamberlain under Chamberlain Charles Hastings Judd. In 1882 he served as acting chamberlain during Judd's trip to Europe and was appointed as a member of the King's Staff with the rank of colonel on December23, 1884. By the end of August 1886, he had resigned the office of vice chamberlain after his superior Judd was dismissed from his post and asked to resign by the king at the instigation of the newly appointed prime minister, Walter M. Gibson, and the cabinet ministers.; ; Between 1886 and 1887 Purvis attempted to undermine the Gibson administration. He was alleged to be the author or co-author, along with Alatau T. Atkinson, of The Grand Duke of Gynbergdrinkenstein and the Gynberg Ballad, two anonymous political satires that parodied the corruption of the Hawaiian court and mocked Kalākaua, Gibson, and other people in their inner circle. According to Ralph Simpson Kuykendall, these were \\"a satirical take-off on various features and incidents of the Kalakaua–Gibson regime\\" used \\"to convince the public that the administration of the kingdom was not only corrupt and unworthy of trust, but also ridiculous\\". To the annoyance of the government, these two pamphlets were widely circulated in Honolulu and even sent to London by the British ambassador to Hawaii.; ; ; ; ; These works and other factors including the Aki opium scandal and the failed attempt to form a Polynesian Confederacy contributed to the demise of the Gibson administration and the passage of the Bayonet Constitution of 1887, which severely limited the power of the king. Purvis made many friends among Hawaii's Portuguese immigrant community and became an expert player of the machete (otherwise known as the cavaquinho). Thus, it is popularly believed that the Hawaiian musical instrument, the ukulele (an adaption of these Portuguese instruments), was named for Purvis, as the term can be translated as \\"jumping flea\\"a nickname of the small, excitable, and quick-fingered Purvis.; ; Modern scholarship has cast doubt on this popular legend, though. According to historians John King and Jim Tranquada, \\"it is unlikely that the nickname of a man who sought to undermine the king in the months prior to the imposition of the Bayonet Constitution of 1887 would have been applied to an instrument favored by native Hawaiians\\". Later life and death After 1886 Purvis became a resident of Hanamaulu, on the island of Kauai. He was appointed Animal Inspector for Kauai on November14, 1887. In May 1888 he left the Hawaiian Islands for the United States for his health. Settling in Colorado Springs, Colorado, he initially wrote home stating that he was improving, but his condition worsened.

They have influences of progressive rock and classic rock. Their debut album, \\"The Gigsaw (2009)\\", was an independent release and, because of a great sell in Europe and USA, it was re-released in Brazil by the label \\"Progressive Rock Worldwide / Megahard Records\\", in a remixed and remastered deluxe digipack version, with three bonus tracks and a new artwork. History Sub Rosa was originally formed by Reinaldo José, Vinicius Mendes, and Daniel Deboni in 2006. This trio never played together, but it was the first step to join the first stable line-up: Reinaldo José (bass and vocals), Vinicius Mendes (guitars, keyboards and vocals), Junior Mansur (keyboards, guitars and vocals) and Romulo Cesar (drums and vocals). This line-up recorded only a demo cd, in 2007, with the songs \\"Enslavement of Beauty\\", \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" and \\"Desvendando Mistérios\\". In 2008, Sub Rosa disbanded during the first recording sessions of their debut album. Reinaldo José produced, by himself, the full album. Soon, Marcia Cristina and Glaydston Friederich (both singers) became official band members, while the album was recorded with the help of some special guests. The Gigsaw was released in December/2009. The first show took place in the \\"Ady Rosa de Freitas\\" theatre, with a new line-up: Reinaldo José (bass and vocals), Bárbara Laranjeira (drums and vocals), Márcia Cristina (vocals), Glaydston Friederich (vocals), Al Duarte (keyboards and vocals), Thiago Gil (guitars) and the special guest Daniel Laranjeira (violins). In 2010, Sub Rosa became the winner of the \\"I Festival de Música Independente\\" (I Independent Music Festival) of the WULP Radio with the song \\"Equinox\\". The free publicity brought overseas distributors to \\"The Gigsaw\\", and the increase of the selling granted the band the \\"USA East Coast Tour\\", with six shows in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Pittsburgh, Newark, New York and Boston. 4 states in 18 days of October/2011. In 2014, even with more than 14.000 cd's sold in the US, Asia and Europe, Sub Rosa was not yet recognized in Brazil. Then, the label \\"Progressive Rock Worldwide/Megahard Records\\" released \\"The Gigsaw\\" in a remixed, remastered deluxe digipack version, with 3 bonus tracks and new artwork. Meanwhile, the band recorded the second album, a double set-cd called \\"11:11.\\" The actual line-up is: Reinaldo José (bass and vocals), Bárbara Laranjeira (drums and vocals), Alexandre Salgueiro (keyboards and vocals), Rudolf Pinto (guitars) and ToSan (keyboards). Oddities The main themes of the band are philosophy, psychology, traditional mysticism, mythology and references to occultism. The bandleader, José, is the venerable master of a masonic lodge, called Ars Regia Therion and that in several photos he is linked in some way to the rosycross – AMORC and other orders. There's a theory that the álbum \\"The Gigsaw\\" has a synchrony with the motion picture \\"Neverending Story\\". Also, in an interview to the website Whiplash!, they plant the idea that the album \\"The Gigsaw\\" is some kind of an enigma, a mathematical, symbolical jigsaw where the songs, the lyrics, the artwork and every single element of the opus is there to be studied and put together to form something. Although the band allowed their songs to be freely downloaded everywhere, they achieved a great success overseas, but not in Brazil. Another link for Sub Rosa to mystic themes and secret orders is the fact that they work in a studio called \\"To Mega Therion\\", one of the magic names of Aleister Crowley.

Since 1786 to 1945 Palace used to belong to families Walickis, Zamoyskis, Lubomirskis and Morawskis. After the Second World War it was nationalized and became the summer residence of the Polish prime ministers. Nowadays it is a multifunctional place with hotel, restaurant and reception hall.  History  Since the 17th century, this land was the property of the szlachta family of Zbierzchowskis. They owned Belsk Duży and few of the neighbour villages. This land was acquired in the middle of the 18th century by the close ally and economic council of the last king of Poland, Stanisław August Poniatowski. Bazyli Walicki, the son of Aleksander and Pudencianna of the Czosnkowski family became the owner of Mała Wieś. He married Rose of the Nieborskis and he invested money from the dowry in creating a new manor. The family moved in 1786 to this beautiful, classical palace designed by Polish architect Hilary Szpilowski. The palace was visited by the last Polish king in 1791, when S.A. Poniatowski stopped by after returning from the meeting with Catherine the Great. This visit is memorized by the stone in Mała Wieś park.

The French one laid on the axis of the Palace, the English one and the fruitful one, where first apple trees in Grójec county were planted, which are nowadays the main part of the region's landscape. Nowadays After the renovation held in 2013-2016, the palace was adapted for services purposes. In the place of the old socrealistic reception hall from the 1960s was created multifunctional building - the New Orangery - building similar to many greenhouses built by the Polish aristocracy in the 18th century.

History=17th century Admiral Ove Gjedde constructed a house at the site but never lived there himself. His large home was located at Gammel Mønt. From circa. 1670, the property was owned by vice Chancellor Holger Vind . He also owned the estates Harrested and Gjeddesdal. He was married to Admiral Ove Gjedde's daughter. After Vind's death in 1683, his widow owned the property until her death in 1706. Their son Wilhelm Carl Vind sold it in 1708 to his uncle, Vice Admiral Frederik Gjedde. A few years later, he sold a narrow strip of the site to Borchs Kollegium which had been founded in 1690. From 1708, Ludvig Holberg served as steward (hovmester) for Gjedde's three sons but left the position after about a year when he obtained a residence at Borchs Kollegium in August 1709. Gjedde moved to Odense in 1713 after being appointed to prefect (stiftsamtmand) of Funen and it is unclear who owned the property in Store Kannikestræde for the next decade. 18th century Kanslergården was from 1722 owned by Abraham Lehn the Younger, who also owned the Lehn House in Christianshavn He purchased several estates on Lolland in 1725–26 but stayed in the building during the winter months. The rest of the building was rented out to foreign envoys. The Austrian envoy was a tenant in the building in 1728. The house was almost completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. Lehn did not rebuilt his house in Store Kannikestræde but sold the site to a developer, Oluf Lange, who sold off part of the garden in lots. Om 1738, he sold the remain site to Sebastian Lier, another developer. He constructed the buildings at No. 6-10\\\\. Chamberlain Hans Frederik Levetzau was a tenant at No. 10 from 1642 to 1644. The property was acquired by royal medicus Hieronimus Laub. The rear wing was at this point a stables with room for four horses and a carriage. In 1748, Laub sold the property to another physician, Jens Bing, who had close tied to Hans Gram and Ludvig Holberg. The first detailed description of the building dates from 1749. The new rear wing contained washhouse in the ground floor and pantry and storage space for firewood on the first floor. A gateway opened to a second courtyard with the new stables as well as henhouse. Bing died in 1751. He had no children and left the property to the university. The university sold it in public auction to lieutenant-colonel Albrecht v. der Lühe. In 1763, he sold it to Supreme Court justice Joachim Anchersen. After his death in 1785 it was once again sold in auction. The buyer was Mads Bie, secretary of Admiraliteten. In 1792, Mads Bie sold the property to Supreme Court attorney Niels Hoftved. 19th century Verdelins gård In 1794, the property was acquired by printmaker Johan Friederich Foltmar, who converted the side and rear wings into a printing business. A merchant, Gerhard Lotze, took over the property in 1806. It just escaped the flames during the British bombardment of the city in 1807. Lotze carried out a comprehensive refurbishment of the buildings. The most significant change was that he replaced the old stables with a three-storey warehouse. In 1847, the property was purchased by the grocer Johannes Nicolai Verdelin. He manufactured blue dye, pencils and salpeter in the rear wings. The property was owned by the Verdelin family for 70 years with his son Carl Verdelin and his grandson Olad Verdelin (from 1887= as the next owners. He experimented with cinema lighting and was the first to use limelight in cinemas in Denmark. Several members of the family had literary aspirations. Hohannes Verdelin published a volume of poems and tales in 1812. His son published \\"Six Romances\\" in 1840 and a daughter published several volumes of fairytales. 20th century Admiral Gjeddes Gård photographed by Admiral Gjeddes Gård The courtyard photographed by Holger Damgaard Eddie Salicath, a young wealthy art dealer, purchased the building in 1918. He introduced the name Admiral Gjeddes Gård the architects Henning Koch and professor Carl Petersen with a comprehensive restoration of the complex which was completed in 1920. On the first floor of the rear wing, Salicath opened Holbergsalen, a venue for literary and cultural events. The writer Tom Kristensen made his first public appearance at the opening event in 1920. Later visitors included Hans Ahlmann, Marius Børup, Marie Bregendahl, Broby-Johansen, Chr. Hovmark, Johannes Buchholtz, and Oskar Hansen. The manuscript for Leonora Christine's Jammersminde which had recently been discovered by professor Otto Andrup was exhibited in connection with a Leonora Christine lecture hosted by Dansk Forfatterforening. In August 1920, Salicath and professor Karl Larsen hosted a number of fund raising events to raise money for food aid to Germany and Austria after World War I. Participants included Edith Rode, Fredrik Nygaard, Henning Kehler and Emil Bønnelycke. The courtyard was also used as a venue for social events, for instance a cometogether in connection with Hans Hartvig Seedorff's homecoming from a journey abroad. The Danish Union of Journalists acquired the building in 1921 for DKK 408.600 . The unions new premises were inaugurated in September 1921 in the presence of Minister of Interior Affairs Krag. The ground floor of the rear wing was converted into a tavern which was later named Digterkroen, the chief of police and the mayor. The premises were still used for hosting cultural and social events. These included a concert with Jean Sibelius and the violinist Henry Holst. Knud Røssel, a real estate agent, purchased the building in 1933 for DKK 215.000. Digterkroen closed on 15 July that same year and its former premises were taken over by Konservativ Ungdom. The rest of the complex was divided into Multi-family residential housing. The Knights Hospitaller became a tenant in 1934. Statutory auditor H. C. Steen Hansen purchased the property in 1942. The designer Holger Blom created a residence in Salicath's former apartment above the Holberg Room. In January 1968, Digterkroen played host to Richard, 6th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein- Berleburg's bachelor's party in the building prior to his marriage to Princess Benedikte of Denmark.

Overview Carla Olson desire to cut a duet record had been in development for several decades. In an interview with journalist Mike Ragogna she stated: :Several years ago, I was in between production projects, which is what I mainly do. I haven't done a studio album in a long time, mainly because I've been working at producing. One day I just thought, \\"Well, I'm in between projects. Maybe I should try to start something.\\" I approached a couple of people about doing a duet album, one of them being Peter Case, who I’ve known since the '70s, and he said, \\"Yeah, I’d love to.\\" Olson then rounded up a host of her friends and bandmates as well as some of her favorite singers. Among these were Juice Newton, who duets with Olson in \\"You Can Come Cryin' to Me\\", the album's opening track, and \\"Stringin' Me On\\". Olson and Peter Case team on the Del Shannon tune \\"Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow the Sun)\\" and on Moby Grape's \\"8:05\\".

In his review of the album music critic Thom Jurek stated: :Though there isn't a weak cut in bunch, there are some soaring highlights It ends the set by seamlessly melding folk, rock, and country.

The remains of the South Point station are now heritage-listed. Tracks The standard gauge track with 1435 mm (4 ft 8½ in) gauge was laid in stages between 1914 and 1920. It was primarily used for transporting phosphate from the mines, but it also transported passengers, such as the miners' children to school.Christmas Island Light Railways issue 29 Spring 1969 pages 4-7 When phosphate mining ceased, the railway was taken out of use in 1987. The tracks have been lifted and scrapped by now. Various remains including a GE 44-ton switcher diesel engine are still on the island. It ran from Drumsite to South PointSouth Point Settlement . It was extended from Drumsite to Phosphate Works in 1958 and to Phosphate Hill 1961. In addition the company operated a narrow gauge railway with 610 mm (2 ft) gauge on the island.David Jehan: Shays, Crabs and Phosphate.

These were imported from Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the USA including three 70 ton geared Shay locomotives, a type of locomotive predominantly used within the USA. According to the time table, the Shay locomotives needed 2 hours per trip, requiring 20–30 minutes on each journey for refuelling with wood and water. They hauled normally 16 steel hopper wagons of 15 tons tare and 22 tons load each, i.e. an average load of approximately 600 tons behind the tender.Christmas Island Phosphate Co.'s Railway New 0-8-0 Locomotive. Originally published in Locomotive, Railway Carriage & Wagon Review on 15 May 1931. On the standard gauge were seven steam locomotives, from Lima Locomotive Works, Peckett & Sons and Robert Stephenson & Hawthorn in use. Additionally ten standard gauge internal combustion locomotives from Orenstein & Koppel, Whitcomb, Canadian Locomotive Company and General Electric were used. On the narrow gauge railway, there were twenty- three 2 ft gauge internal-combustion locomotives from Orenstein & Koppel, Robert Hudson, Baguley and Hunslet Engine Company, with the oldest dating from around 1912. Passenger vehicles For passenger transport a Drewry railcar and three Wickham railcars with five trailers were used. The key objective of the Wickham railcars was to provide rolling stock for the School Train. A few flat wagons were also modified for transporting passengers. These were for instance used for the Picture Train, to transport passengers to and from the island’s cinema. There were also two unusual rail vehicles for carrying passengers on an incline.

Ball's computer dating service also pre-dated the earliest American computer dating services, like Operation Match at Harvard.  Early life  Joan Ball was born in 1934 and was the 6th child in her family. She was an unwanted child born to a poor, working-class family. She was briefly abandoned by her mother when she was very young. World War II started when she was only five years old, resulting in her being evacuated from London to the countryside to escape the aerial bombardments of London three times during the war. Although this may have saved her life, each foster family differed greatly and she was sexually harassed by one of the foster families with whom she lived. When the war was over she was able to go home to her family in London again. Joan Ball was dyslexic and struggled in school. She went through most of her life suffering from dyslexia, before it was known as such. She was not officially diagnosed until 1973, at the age of 39. As a coping mechanism she became the class clown when she was in school, so that she could make sure people \\"laughed with [her]\\" and not at her. During her school years she had a difficult home life: her mother often called her \\"a pig-headed bitch\\", and blamed Joan for her failing marriage. In 1949, Ball finished her last year of school and got a job as a shop assistant at The London Co-operative Society. Because of her dyslexia she had problems with writing and counting money.  Career and later life  In 1953, Ball was hospitalized after a suicide attempt and when she got out she went to live with her aunt Maud and uncle Ted. The same year, at the age of 19, she got hired at Bourne & Hollingsworth. In 1954, she left and started working in a store's dress department. She found this string of jobs unfulfilling and difficult: at the time, the most interesting parts of the fashion industry—in Ball's view—were still a man's world and she could not do the kind of work she was interested in, like design. Shortly thereafter, however, she was able to start working for Berkertex, a leading fashion house in London.  Eros Friendship Bureau Ltd  In 1961, when she was 27, she decided to leave Berkertex. Though she had intended to manage a shop in Cambridge she found herself out of a job until the shop was ready to open. Needing to pay rent, she took a job at a marriage bureau. It was here that she decided to start her own marriage bureau. She founded the Eros Friendship Bureau Ltd in 1962 and discovered she had a knack for helping people make connections. Though her company would go on to be successful for a decade, she had trouble advertising her service early on because of the fact marriage bureaus were seen as slightly suspect at the time: There was a widespread belief that marriage bureaus were actually fronts for prostitution. Because she could not advertise in print easily Ball relied on placing radio ads with the \\"Pop Pirates\\"—the pirate radio stations that operated just off the coast of Britain in the 1960s playing rock and roll music that the BBC had banned. Ball's company focused on long term match-ups and relationships—primarily trying to achieve marriages for clients—and catered to an older crowd who were looking to settle down or who had been previously divorced. In 1961, she met a man she refers to in her memoir as Kenneth. Kenneth would later become her sexual partner and would help her in her business, though they were never married.  St. James Computer Dating Service  Joan changed the name of her marriage bureau to the St. James Computer Dating Service in 1964 and the bureau ran its first set of computer match ups in 1964. This made Ball's service the first commercially successful computer dating service in either the UK or the US, as historian Marie Hicks points out in a recent article on the history of computer dating.  Com-Pat  In 1965, Ball merged her company with another marriage bureau run by a woman and together they formed Com-Pat, or Computer Dating Services Ltd. Shortly after the merger, the owner of the other marriage bureau sold out her share in the company to Joan and Joan became the sole proprietor of Com- Pat.  Competition from rival companies  Dateline, founded by John Richard Patterson in 1966, was a rival to Com-Pat. With this new rivalry, Ball saw the greater need for more advertising. Looking at questionnaires from Dateline and Operation Match in the US, she learned that they emphasized questions about sex, which she and her employees thought would not lead to good matches. By 1969, her company was receiving a good response to their ads in News of the World, but Ball still felt she had to overcome the mindset that people had about computer dating being slightly odd or untoward. Newspapers at the time implied the people who used these services were lonely, sad or dysfunctional. Joan believed that this type of computer dating service was, on the contrary, a fun and intelligent way to meet people. Though newspapers sometimes painted a negative picture, Joan's company was generally well received by the public. This led her to advertise in The Sunday Express, Evening Standard, and The Observer—all major British newspapers at the time. At this time, Ball was running both Com-Pat and Eros. Soon she decided to sell Eros and focus on Com-Pat. She realized how important the future of computerized dating was and saw the potential growth of a service like Com- Pat.  Com-Pat II  In 1970, Com-Pat Two was launched. Joan and her company were ahead of the game, because they were using the most advanced matching system created at the time. They were able to change the whole system with 50,000 members in a single weekend without any problems. The system used a questionnaire, and gave a list of four of the top matches at the end. Though Joan had success with Com-Pat Two, she and her partner Ken began to run into economic and personal problems. Because Joan and Ken weren't married, Ball felt she had no sense of security with him. She eventually moved into her own flat after living with Ken for eight years. This new place gave her a sense of independence, security, and pride because of what she had needed to accomplish to get it. = Problems with advertisements = Unfortunately troubled times were ahead for her company. Ball realized that their telephone number and address had been printed incorrectly in one of her major advertisements. Their telephone number had also been removed from the directory. This forced her to get a new phone number. At the same time, Dateline was becoming more and more successful and was able to leverage the fact the newspapers already took Com- Pat's advertisements to place its own ads in the same papers without the difficulties that Ball had faced earlier. In 1971, there was a Post Office strike which halted all mail. It lasted almost eight weeks and Ball's business couldn't do anything during that time. Everything hit an all-time low when the Daily Telegraph, the company's most successful advertising venue, refused to continue printing ads for Com-Pat because the paper had changed their advertising policy. Joan became depressed and felt unable to cope. At the same time, the UK was wracked with major strikes and economic problems: The miners' strike was causing chaos nationwide by disrupting the country's ability to produce electricity and power the government, businesses and industries that kept the economy functioning.  Sale of Com-Pat to Dateline  In 1973, when she was 39, she was finally diagnosed with dyslexia. Not many people knew the word, so she stopped using it when no one else knew what she was talking about. She had trouble coming to terms with her own illness. By this time, the recession had worsened. She had been fighting to keep her company afloat but by 1974 she was in debt and decided to sell her company. She called John Paterson of Dateline and offered Com-Pat to him, if her would agree to pay all of the company's debts as part of the purchase. Seeing that this was a way to monopolize the computer dating market in the UK by doing away with Dateline's only major competitor, Patterson quickly agreed.  Later life  After a series of personal difficulties, Ball converted to Buddhism and began to come to terms with her illnesses and setbacks. Ball found herself with many regrets and came to the conclusion that she had locked herself away in her own emotional dungeon even though she had run a company focused on making new emotional connections between other people.  Impact and importance in the history of technology  Ball was a successful entrepreneur who was the first person of any gender to run a commercially viable computer dating service in either the UK or the USA. Her company predated Harvard's \\"Operation Match\\" by a year and preceded the other major British computer dating company, Dateline (run by John Patterson). Com-Pat operated under Ball's management for nearly a decade, until she was eventually bought out by Dateline in 1974. Ball's experience shows that, contrary to popular narratives on the web, women were in fact early pioneers in the field of computer dating and social networking by computer. The fact that Ball has remained mostly unknown until now also reflects how gendered stereotypes have resulted in the historical submersion of women's contributions in computing. Janet Abbate, a historian of computing and professor at Virginia Tech, theorized in her book Recoding Gender--a history of women in computing—that \\"women who did make significant contributions were not always inclined, by temperament or socialization, to trumpet their accomplishments\\". Historians Nathan Ensmenger, Marie Hicks, Margot Lee Shetterly, and Jennifer Light have all shown, in their scholarship on gender in the history of computing, how structural inequality in both the present and the past has altered our view of historical reality when it comes to computing. The existence of these social dynamics in both the past and present has left many parts of computing history untold. Currently, historians are beginning to correct these oversights and to show how women like Joan Ball were important in the history of computer dating, and computing more generally.

En route the ship was becalmed and lay still upon the sea for two weeks.Corning Museum of Glass: Blaschkas' Glass Models of Invertebrate Animals (1863–1890) During this period of forced idleness, Leopold studied and sketched the local marine invertebrate population, intrigued by the transparency of their bodies similar to the glass his family had long worked.

Johanna Dühning, Chairman of the Association; translation by Benjamin Pentzold (). Leopold felt a sense of quiet, inspirational, wonder at these luminescent ocean dwellers, a sense which he recorded and translated by Henri Reiling: \\"It is a beautiful night in May. Hopeful, we look out over the darkness of the sea, which is as smooth as a mirror; there emerges all around in various places a flashlike bundle of light beams, as if it is surrounded by thousands of sparks, that form true bundles of fire and of other bright lighting spots, and the seemingly mirrored stars. There emerges close before us a small spot in a sharp greenish light, which becomes ever larger and larger and finally becomes a bright shining sunlike figure.\\" This sense of wonder would fuel his later work but, in the meantime and upon his return to Dresden, Leopold focused on his family business which was the production the glass eyes, costume ornaments, lab equipment, and other such fancy goods and specialty items that only a master Lampworker could accomplish;Harvard University Herbaria and Botany Libraries plus the task of furthering the training of his son and apprentice (and eventual successor), Rudolf Blaschka. However, like anyone, he did have free time, and his hobby was to make glass models of plants – as opposed to invertebrates. This would, many years later, become a base for the fabled Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants (otherwise known as the Glass Flowers), but, for the moment, such artistry was naught but an amusing and profitless pastime done between his various commissions. Yet, unsurprisingly given their stunning quality, this amusing hobby – itself born out of seeking consolation in nature upon his wife's death – attracted attention. Aristocratic attention, as it turned out, specifically the eyes of Prince Camille de Rohan who, being something of a naturalist himself, commissioned the Blaschkas to craft 100 glass orchids for his private collection.\\"Leopold + Rudolf Blaschka {...} The Glass Aquarium {...}\\". Design Museum (designmuseum.org). Retrieved 2015-06-10. Naturally the Prince was more than a little impressed by the mastery Leopold's work, and \\"between 1860 and 1862, the prince exhibited about 100 models of orchids and other exotic plants, which he displayed on two artificial tree trunks in his palace in Prague,\\" a fateful act which brought the skill of the Blaschkas to the attention of another – man whom the Prince had actually once introduced to Leopold: a certain Ludwig Reichenbach.A Tale of Two Glassworkers and Their Marine Marvels Reichenbach's request Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach Director of the natural history museum in Dresden, Prof. Reichenbach was faced with an annoying yet seemingly unsolvable problem in regards to showing marine life. Land-based flora and fauna was not an issue, for it was a relatively simple matter to exhibit mounted and stuffed creatures such as gorillas and elephants, there lifelike poses attracting and exciting the museums visitors. Invertebrates, however, and by their very nature, posed a problem.Cornell University In the 19th century the only practiced method of showcasing them was to take a live specimen and place it in a sealed jar of alcohol.The Blaschka Archive This of course killed it but, more importantly, time and their lack of hard parts eventually rendered them into little more than colorless floating blobs of jelly. Neither pretty nor a terribly effective teaching tool, Prof. Reichenbach wanted something more, specifically 3D colored models of marine invertebrates that were both lifelike and able to stand the test of time. And, per remarkably coincidence, in 1863 \\"saw an exhibition of highly detailed, realistic glass flowers created by a Bohemian lampworker named Leopold Blaschka.\\" Blaschka model of sea anemones Enchanted by the botanical models and positive that Leopold held the key to ending his own showcasing issue, in 1863 Reichenbach convinced and commissioned Leopold to produce twelve model sea anemones.Museum of Natural History Berlin, Historical collection of pictures and writings – Katalog über Blaschka's Modelle, L. Blaschka, Dresden, 1885 These marine models, hailed as \\"an artistic marvel in the field of science and a scientific marvel in the field of art,\\" were a great improvement on previous methods of presenting such creatures: drawings, pressing, photographs and papier-mâché or wax models.Goodyear, Anne Collins, and Weitekamp, Margaret A. Analyzing Art and Aesthetics. Artefacts: Studies in the History of Science and Technology ; v. 9. 2013. and exactly what Prof. Reichenbach needed. Moreover they, at last, provided an outlet for the wonder Leopold had felt all those years ago when observing the phosphorescent ocean life. The key fact, though, was that these glass marine models were, as would soon be acknowledged, \\"perfectly true to nature,\\"Fragile Legacy: The Marine Invertebrate Glass Models of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka and as such represented an extraordinary opportunity boh for the scientific community and the Blaschkas themselves. Knowing this and thrilled with his newly acquired set of glass sea creatures, Reichenbach advised Leopold to drop his current and generations long family business of glass fancy goods and the like in favor of selling glass marine invertebrates to museums, aquaria, universities, and private collectors. Advice which would prove wise and fateful both economically and scientifically, for Leopold did as the Dresden natural history museum director suggested. A successful business Blaschka model of jellyfish Unlike the eventual Glass Flower, a private commission to a single University's museum, the Blaschka glass sea creatures were a global enterprise; and not just for museums and other such educational institutes, for \\"as popular interest in the history and sciences of the natural world burgeoned during the latter half of the 19th century, the sea became particularly alluring. The spread of home aquariums and the advent of deep-sea diving revealed a new frontier, filled with wondrous and unusual creatures.\\"University of Wisconsin–Madison: ‘Glass menagerie:’ Museum unearths exotic stash of glass sea creatures In short, for the first time since Darwin, there was great universal interest in the natural world, and it became a sign of culture, of worldliness and sophistication, to exhibit examples of life in one's drawing rooms and parlors.Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass Hence private individuals were after these extraordinary models as well, and the Blaschkas, knowing this and knowing that Reichenbach was correct in that many museums would want them, made a mail-order business out of it. This business was hugely successful and they ended up making and selling 10,000 glass invertebrates dispersed in a diaspora of shipments all across the globe.“Hands On” with Fragile Glass Sea Creatures by Matteo Wong - https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2020/08/blaschka-3d-sea-creatures Indeed, \\"the world had never seen anything quite like the beautiful, scientifically accurate Blaschka models\\" and yet they were available via so common a means as mail-order per one's local card catalog; for example, Ward's Natural Science would sell a small glass octopus for approximately $2.50. Not glorious, perhaps, but highly effective, and museums and universities began purchasing them en masse to put on display much as Prof. Reichenbach had – for natural history museums directors the world over had the same marine invertebrate showcasing problem. In short, Blaschka invertebrate models mail-order enterprise succeeded for two reason: 1- there was a huge and global demand; 2- they were the only and best glass artists capable of crafting literally scientifically flawless models. Initially the designs for these were based on drawings in books, but Leopold was soon able to use his earlier drawings to produce highly detailed models of other species, and his reputation quickly spread. As Leopold wrote in an English-language trade catalog preserved at the Rakow Research Library at The Corning Museum of Glass: \\"[Models of invertebrate animals] have been purchased by... museums and scholastic establishments in all the quarters of the globe... in New Zealand... in Tokio [sic], Japan... for the Indian Museum in Calcutta... in the United States of America by Professor Ward's Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, New York; for the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts; for the Boston Society of Natural History; the University of Cornell; the Wellesley Female College...

Yet the fate of the marine invertebrate mail-order business was ultimately to be tied to those bought by Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. At some time after the museum's founding in 1859, a collection of 430 glass sea creatures were purchased by either Louis Agassiz, the first director, or his son and successor Alexander Agassiz.Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass This set was not the largest ever sold and the models were no different from any of the others made by the Blaschkas, but their effect was to be greater than all the rest combined. From invertebrates to flowers 150px Paradoxically and in historically circular twist, the reason that the glass sea creatures sold to Harvard were to prove so crucial was because the University would soon, and did, open its new Botanical Museum in 1888. Given in effect a series of empty rooms and invited to make a museum for teaching botany, the first director, George Lincoln Goodale, faced a familiar problem. At that time, Harvard was the global center of botanical study and, as such, Prof. Goodale wanted the best for his students, but the only used method was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled botanical specimens – a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color.http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir- pdfs/goodale-george.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir Hence they were hardly the ideal teaching tools. In fact, Goodale's problem was essentially the same as Reichenbach's had been, but applied to botany rather than marine biology for, in both cases, the practiced method of exhibition robbed the specimens of color and three-dimensional form. A glass model of a cactus at the Harvard Museum of Natural History Moreover and also like Prof. Reichenbach, Prof. Goodale first learned of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschkas' skill per an exhibition – that being the glass marine invertebrates belonging to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. And, like Reichenbach, upon seeing the Blaschkas' work Goodale was instantly sure that they held the answer to his showcasing problem. Thus, in yet another direct historical parallel, in 1886 the Blaschkas were approached by Goodale for the sole purpose of finding them, with a request to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard. Naturally Leopold was initially unwilling as, again, his current business of selling glass marine invertebrates was booming; but, eventually, the famed glass artists agreed to send test-models to the U.S. and, although damaged in customs, the fragments convinced Goodale that Blaschka glass art was a more than worthy educational investment. Thus, with the generous sponsorship of Elizabeth C. Ware and her daughter Mary, the initial contract was signed and dictated that the Blaschkas need only work half-time on the models, thus allowing them to continue their production of the Glass sea creatures. However, in 1890, they and Goodale – acting on behalf of the Wares – signed an updated version that allowed Leopold and Rudolf to work on them (the Glass Flowers) full-time;Schultes, Richard Evans., William A. Davis, and Hillel Burger. The Glass Flowers at Harvard. New York: Dutton, 1982. Print.The Corning Museum of Glass (Blaschkas’ Glass Botanical Models (1886–1936)) though some sources describe the agreement as a shift from a 3-year contract to a 10-year one, agreed to once Goodale convinced Mary and her mother of the wisdom in doing so.Rossi-Wilcox, Susan M., and David Whitehouse. Drawing upon Nature: Studies for the Blaschkas' Glass Models. Corning, NY: Corning Museum of Glass, 2007. Print. Regardless, the production and time of the Glass sea creatures was over, their fame as well as the attention of their makers shifting to the Glass Flowers – a project that, fifty years later, ended with the death of Rudolf Blaschka (Leopold having died thirty-nine years earlier). The models today Today, over a century after their making, the Glass sea creatures live in the shadow of their younger botanical cousins, so much so that many of those well aware of the Glass Flowers have never even heard of them. The fact is that, \\"gradually, these glass animals began to disappear, their habitats shifting into dusty closets and museum storage. People began to forget that these incredible glass creations had existed in the first place.\\" Corning With a collection 700 models bought in 1888,Fragile Legacy: The Marine Invertebrate Glass Models of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka the Corning Museum of Glass boasts the largest known collection of Blaschka sea creatures. Displayed (at least in part) in an exhibition named Fragile Legacy, \\"researchers at Cornell are using the collection as a time capsule for seeking out and documenting the creatures still living in our oceans today.\\" Corning's exhibit allows visitors to try crafting glass sea slugsFragile Legacy as well as view subsequent works inspired by the Blaschkas.Inspired by Blaschka The exhibit is open through January 8, 2017. The Corning Museum of Glass produced a film entitled Fragile LegacyFragile Legacy exploring the related topics of the Glass sea creatures and the living ones they represent. Harvard Front view of Harvard's temporary renovation exhibit Even those specimens purchased by Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) suffered a degree of neglect; they were not forgotten, but they were scattered much as the quote above describes, across several departments, and it was believed that the University only possessed 60-70 models (rather than the actual 430).Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass Recently Harvard has restored and, to best of their abilities, repaired the Glass sea creatures with the hired and instrumental help of Preservation Specialist and Glass Worker Elizabeth R. Brill of Corning, New York, a marine biologist and daughter of a glass chemist.Undersea life, clear as glass (Brill later co-authored a book about the Glass sea creatures.) Today they form the Harvard Museum of Natural History Sea Creatures in Glass display which, when combined with the Glass Flowers, form the largest Blaschka collection on display in the world.Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass =Harvard's renovation exhibit= For a several month period beginning in 2015 and set to end in the early summer of 2016, the HMNH set up a \\"temporary display highlighting twenty-seven of the most popular plant models as well as some items from the Blaschka archives\\"Glass Flowers Renovation Project Frequently Asked Questions (Harvard University Herbaria and Botany Libraries) while the main Glass Flowers exhibit was under renovation. This exhibit was unique because it was the first recorded time that the Glass Flowers have been jointly exhibited with the Glass sea creatures in a major and equal display. The renovation exhibit was dismantled when, on May 21, 2016, the main Glass Flowers exhibit reopened. The Glass sea creatures remained as a permanent exhibit. Cornell In 1885 Andrew Dixon White, first president of Cornell University, authorized purchase of 570 glass marine invertebrates, \\"some of which are on exhibit at Corson Mudd Hall and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum, making Cornell one of the few universities in the world where students and the public can view these wondrous creations.\\"Cornell University: History of the Blaschka Collection However and like so many of their counterpart collections, they were neglected after a time and, in this case, remained forgotten under dust and grit until the latter half of the 20th century.

Crucially and naturally, the Congress dealt with the Glass Flowers no less than their older maritime cousins.Proceedings of the Dublin Blaschka Congress, special issue, Historical Biology 20 no. 1 (2008). University of Wisconsin–Madison In 2007 the University of Wisconsin–Madison Zoological Museum accidentally uncovered their hitherto forgotten 50-model collection in a \\"series of keyholes under the exhibit cases along a first-floor corridor Curator Paula Holahan made the discovery, stating \\"It's not uncommon to find things packed away in any museum that is over 100 years old.\\" The specimens, currently too brittle to be publicly displayed, remain in storage until conservation measures are funded and completed. These funds are not materializing, although the museum hopes to one willing to sponsor the restoration before the effects of age become irreversible. Natural History Museum, London The Natural History Museum, London holds 182 of the models. Natural History Museum, Wollaston Hall, Nottingham, England There is a large display of marine invertebrates and also two models of single cell animals living in fresh water.

She received a degree in 1919 from Barnard College in New York, studying zoology, stratigraphy and sedimentation.  Personal life  Mary was born on December 16, 1896 in Cincinnati, Ohio where she spent the majority of her childhood. Her father was Ernest Welleck, a well-known scientific editor and journalist. Her mother was the daughter of Thomas Satterwhite Noble, the noted 19th century American artist. Mary attended grade school at the Girls Latin School in Boston from 1909 - 1914. After graduating from grade school, she attended Barnard College in New York where she studied a wide diversity of subjects, mostly related to the sciences, and earned an A.B. in 1918. While attending Barnard college, she studied under Professor Amadeus W. Grabau, and later went on to work as his research assistant on multiple research projects at Columbia University. She received her M.A. degree in Geology from Columbia in 1919, specializing in invertebrate zoology, stratigraphy and sedimentation. While working and studying at Columbia, Mary met her husband, William Melvin Garretson and was married on September 27, 1922. She had two children, Mary Louise Garretson and William Welleck Garretson. She died in White Plains, New York, on May 8, 1971 after a brief illness.  Work in Geology and Science  While working on her graduate studies at Columbia University, Mary found a job as a teacher at the Young Men's Christian Association. In her first teaching job, Mary taught her students an Introduction to Geology course from 1921 to 1923. During her teaching job, she also became an assistant at the Brooklyn Children's Museum where her contributions were made throughout 1920. While continuing teaching, Mrs. Garretson began her consulting work in the field of geology during World War Two. She was hired by airline and industrial companies from 1946 to 1951, where she studied and wrote about the geological characteristics of many areas to help these companies thrive. One of these articles was published in the New York Times and was about the geological characteristics of New York City. After finishing her consulting roles, Mary returned to her teaching jobs and eventually become the Vice President of the Haitian- American Resource Company from 1956 to the time of her death. She made tremendous contributions to the Haitian government by consulting and advising on mineral economics, and the development of geological studies and developments in Haiti. In 1966, Mrs. Garretson's contributions to geology were recognized and she became a member of The Geological Society of America, American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers, the International Society of Economic Geologists, the American Geophysical Union, the Geological Society of China, the New York Historical Society, and became a founder of the Westchester County Conservation Association and was on the board of Directors from 1933 to 1950. Perhaps Mrs. Garretson's greatest achievement was her contribution and aid to the works of Professor Grabau. Mary is referenced in Grabau's Introduction to Geology textbook, and says that she \\"has been my assistant throughout the arrangement of this text for the press, and has been of the greatest service in securing illustrations.” Professor Grabau and Mrs. Garretson's research was instrumental in the studies and knowledge of sedimentation. With Garretson's help, Grabau went on to write papers about his findings on North American index fossils. Grabau attempted to collect fossil evidence that could link North American fossils to fossils around the world in hopes of reaffirming his idea of a Paleozoic Pangaea.  Contributions to Geological Theory  Grabau and Garretson believed in and studied the theory of horizontal displacement, and was considered to be a mobilist. The theory of horizontal displacement was first proposed by Alfred Wegner in 1912 and, due to popular belief at that time, was not widely accepted, especially in North America and Europe. The theory starting gaining traction when the model of plate tectonics and continental drift were first introduced. With these models in place, geologists began searching for fossil evidence that could prove that organisms, that can be found all over the globe now, once existed in the same location. Professor Grabau and Mrs. Garretson were among the scientist who took interest to Wegner's claim, and began looking for fossil evidence in North America. During her tenure at Columbia University, Mrs. Garretson assisted Professor Grabau in his book titled \\"North American Index Fossils.\\" The goal of this paper was to study the various index fossils found in North America and try to compile evidence that supported the theory that a single, great continent was existed on Earth called Pangaea. The book goes into tremendous detail regarding information on each class of fossils found, and each class having its separate structural descriptions and general description of key characteristics tying it to a family, or, genus. In the early 1930s, Professor Grabau moved to China to study the continental stratigraphy and index fossils the country possessed. During his study in China, Mrs. Garretson was his representative in the United States, and served as his research assistant. Grabau searched for further for evidence of the ancient super continent and informed Mrs. Garrestson of his research, who then summarized and reported his findings to several Geology groups and faculties in North America. Mrs. Garretson assisted, and was referenced in, all of Professor Grabau's Chinese research papers until his eventual death, including: * Ordovician Fossils of North China (1921) * Early Permian Fossils of China (1934) * Paleozoic Corals of China (1921) * Stratigraphy of China (1924–25) References 2\\\\. https://archive.org/details/northamericanind02grab Category:1896 births Category:1971 deaths Category:American paleontologists ","title":"Mary Welleck Garretson"},{"id":"52164368","title":"Athletics at the 1986 Commonwealth Games – Men's high jump"},{"id":"52164369","text":"Anderson Landing is an unincorporated community in Coahoma County, Mississippi, United States.

The temple complex has a large central temple, which has a rectangular plan.  History  The temple was built around 1090 CE, during the reign of king Kyanzittha. A later ink inscription on the temple walls attributes its construction to Kyanzittha's queen Abeyadana. A local legend states that the temple was built at the place where Kyanzittha's queen Abeyadana waited for him. According to G.H. Luce and Ba Shin, Abeyadana came from the Pattikera kingdom located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent (around present-day Comilla District in Bangladesh). The murals in the temple are of east Indian (Pala) style, and were probably created by artists from eastern India.  Paintings  Bodhisattva painting in Abeyadana temple The main idol of the temple is a brick image of Gautama Buddha. On the west side of the Buddha image, a portrait-figure shows Abeydana praying to him. The north side of entrance hall features eight rows of Jataka frescos, with titles in Pali language and descriptions in Mon language (and often, the number of the Jataka tale). A subsidiary panel shows the Buddha delivering his first sermon (the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta). He is sitting cross-legged on a lotus throne, and his hands are in Dharmachakra mudra pose. He is surrounded by people paying obeisance to him: two celestial beings showering lotus flowers at the top, and two kings at the bottom. There is also an image of the goddess Tara, who is shown with a curvy body, dressed in royal attire. On her left side, there is a padma lotus, and on her right side, there is a blue lotus. These flowers are said to signify her purity. Besides the orthodox Buddhist frescos, the temple walls also feature Tantric and Brahmanic elements.

He is most known for his photographed images of himself apparently falling. One of his well-known images shows him apparently about to fall from the Vance Creek Bridge in Washington State timber country.  Early life and education  Kerry Skarbakka was born in Duluth, Minnesota. His family embraced Christian fundamentalism when Skarbakka was a young boy. They moved to a farming community in Tennessee. At age 7, Skarbakka found that he could speak in tongues. The Chicago Reader states that he \\"witnessed faith healings at tent revivals and in storefronts and basements. People he knew told of encounters with the devil.\\" This early experience informed his career as an artist. Skarbakka received his BA in Studio Art with an emphasis in Sculpture from the University of Washington School of Art. In 2003 he received an MFA in Photography from Columbia College Chicago.  Work  One of Skarbakka's first major exhibitions occurred at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago as part of their \\"New Artists/New Work\\" series. The photography shown depicted \\"anxiety-provoking, large-format photographs\\" showing the artist falling to near certain death. In 2005, one of Skarbakka's \\"falling\\" works was featured on the cover of Aperture Magazine with an accompanying essay by Wayne Koestenbaum. In 2005, one of his \\"falling man\\" performances sparked controversy when some claimed it was a recreation of some of the tragic jumpers from the World Trade Center during September 11 attacks. The artist said that the images were inspired both by the \\"death of his mother and the events of September 11.\\" He began the project to deal with his \\"emotional pain and existential insecurity.\\"  Honors and awards  In 2005 Skarbakka received a Creative Capital grant for his project Fluid. The project premiered at Lawrimore Project in Seattle, Washington.

She served as Minister of Justice of Burkina Faso from 2014–2016. Biography Ouédraogo was born in 1949 and received her early education in Koudougou. She was brought up in the Mossi tradition. Her father was an MP in the French Parliament for French West Africa and her mother was illiterate. After her father was named the ambassador to France, she moved to Paris in 1961. Ouédraogo attended the Institut de la Tour in Paris and she received the baccalauréat in 1968. In 1974, she earned a degree in sociology at the Paris Descartes University. After receiving her degree, Ouédraogo worked as a sociological research assistant and studied rural society, development approaches and their impact on women and peasants. She was a supporter of Thomas Sankara but was overall not involved in politics. Nonetheless, in September 1984 he unexpectedly offered her the position of minister of family development and solidarity. Sankara said her sociological work was helpful to the revolution, and she accepted his offer. In this role, Ouédraogo pushed for an end to female genital mutilation, proposed a national family law, and supported a women's strike in 1984.Sheldon 2016, p. 227 She was instrumental in commemorating 8 March as International Women's Day in Burkina Faso. Sankara was killed in a coup on 15 October 1987 and Blaise Compaoré took power. She moved to Tunisia in December 1987. Ouédraogo went into exile and served as an important figure for women's development in Africa. From 1989 to 1992 she served as a project coordinator for the Pan-African Development Institute in Cameroon. In 1997, she became director of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa's gender division. She was successful in making women's issues a prominent feature in government conferences and task forces. In addition, she created a new evaluation program, the African Gender Development Index.Sheldon 2016, p. 228 She became deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa in 2005. From 2007 to 2011 Ouédraogo was secretary-general of Dakar's Enda Third World. In 2007, she was named one of the 50 most influential women in Africa by Jeune Afrique. In 2012, Ouédraogo returned to Burkina Faso. She became head of the consulting firm Appui recherche action (ARC). In October 2014, Compaoré fell from power after a number of protests that included women brandishing spatulas and brooms to signify their displeasure. Michel Kafando was chosen as president in November 2014 after a panel of 23 officials preferred him to Ouédraogo and journalist Cherif Sy. After Kafando was sworn in, he named Ouédraogo Minister of Justice. She harshly criticized the justice system in the old regime, and one of her first actions was reopening an investigation on the assassination of the president of the National Revolutionary Council, which was blocked for almost two years by the civil courts. Ouédraogo brought together 2,000 civil society members, policemen, judges, and lawyers to Ouagadougou in March 2015 to sign a National Pact for Renewal of Justice. She served until January 2016 and was replaced as minister of justice by Bessolé René Bagoro. Personal life Ouédraogo has a husband and three children, and she also has a grandson named Anthony Ouedraogo. She is a devout Christian. She identifies with feminism and anti-globalization.

Benzing worked as a Linguist in Pers Z S, the signals intelligence agency of the German Foreign Office (). He was the youngest senior official (German:Beamter) and headed the section from October 1939 until September 1944.  Life  After High School, Benzing discovered his profound interest in scholarly issues. This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under a Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported. In 1938, Benzing moved to Berlin to take up Oriental Studies. At the Humboldt University of Berlin, Benzing studied Islamic Philology with Richard Hartmann, Hans Heinrich Schaeder and Walther Björkman, and Turcology with Annemarie von Gabain, and Mongolistics with Erich Haenisch. At the same time, he acquired practical knowledge of oriental languages at the Oriental Seminar, where Gotthard Jäschke and Sebastian Beck belonged to his teachers. He also learnt Tatar from Saadet Ishaki (Çagatay), the daughter of the famous Tatar intellectual Ayaz İshaki. In 1939, Benzing took his examination for promotion of Dr. phil with a thesis on the verbal system of Turkmen, Über die Verbformen im Türkmenischen. In 1942, Benzing habilitated with a thorough study on the subject Chuvash language, called Tschuwaschische Forschungen. At that time, in the middle of the war, Benzing was unable to get an adequate position at a university. Instead he found an occupation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He became a member of the SA in June 1936, and joined the NSDAP in October 1940. From 1937 onwards he held various functions within the NSDAP. He was interned between 1945 and 1946. There is no information available about his denazification. He worked for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, between 1950 and 1955 in Paris, where he established close contacts with the leading French Orientalists (Orientalism). In 1953, he was elected a member of the Oriental Commission of the newly established Academy of Sciences and Literature at Mainz. In 1955, he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany and was one year later appointed consul of the Cultural Section at the Consulate General in Istanbul. Besides his diplomatic duties, Benzing gave courses in Turkic languages at the Turcological Department of the Faculty of Letters (Turkish:Edebiyat Fakültesi) of the University of Istanbul. Sporadically he also taught Turcology at the German universities of Tübingen and Mainz. On December 4, 1963, Johannes Benzing was appointed full professor (German:Ordinarius) in Oriental studies (Islamic philology and Islamic studies) (German:Islamische Philologie and Islamkunde) at the Faculty of Art, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, as the successor of Professor Helmuth Scheel. On February 25, 1966, he was elected Ordinary Member of the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz. In 1973, he moved to become Professor of the Oriental Studies, Department of Philology in Mainz, which he continued until 1981. Together with his fellow professors Georg Buddruss and Helmut Humbach, he arranged interdisciplinary seminars on Central Asian languages, e.g. Pamir languages, Tajik, Khotanese and Tokharian. It was also Benzing who took the initiative to establish Iranistics as an academic discipline at Mainz. Benzing always dealt with the written word in a highly economic way and communicated many of his boldest – and perhaps most fruitful – ideas in oral discussions only, without ever committing them to paper. After the long mobile phases of his life, he did not want to leave Mainz, which meant that he never attended conferences and congresses. On the other hand, he permanently welcomed visiting scholars from all parts of the world, generously sharing his wide knowledge and deep insights with them. On March 31, 1981, Benzing retired from his position at the University of Mainz. Soon after the retirement, he and his wife Käte left Mainz and settled in the borough of Erdmannsweiler in Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, close to their birthplace in the Black Forest. In March 1998, they moved to Bovenden to stay with their daughter, Professor Brigitta Benzing-Wolde Georgis, and her husband, Dr. Kahsai Wolde Georgis. Work With his profound knowledge and wide perspective, Benzing continued the tradition of Willi Bang-Kaup’s Berlin school of linguistic Turcology, though broadening its scope and refining its scholarly working procedures. Besides publishing books and articles, Johannes Benzing devoted much time and care to highly instructive book reviews containing profound analyses and complementary remarks on important scholarly questions. A selection of these reviews: Critical contributions to ancient literature and Turkology (German: Kritische Beiträge zur Altaistik und Turkologie), appeared in 1988 as volume 3 in the series Turcologica magazine (Harrassowitz). Historical-comparative research on Turkic, Tungusic and Mongolic languages was Benzing’s main field of interest, to which he contributed outstanding studies. One example of this is Benzing’s critical occupation with the so-called Altaic question, the still controversial problem of a possible genetic relatedness of Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic (maybe even Korean and Japanese). In a truly visionary paper: Menless land: Inner and North Asia as a philological work area (German:Herrenloses Land: Inner und Nordasien als philologisches Arbeitsgebiet), he argued that the ‘ownerless’ territory of Inner and Northern Asia, filling a fifth of the world’s surface, should finally be subject to comprehensive scholarly study. Dr Johannes Benzing joined Pers Z S on July 20, 1937. He was the youngest senior Beamter in the Pers Z S unit. A linguist, he was a specialist in Near Eastern languages and originally worked under Dr Scherschmidt. He headed this section from October 1939 until September 1944. He was then placed in charge of work for Iranian, Iraqi and Afghanistani systems.  Publications  * Bolgarisch- tschuwaschische Studien.

Young-Eisendrath is the originator of Dialogue Therapy, designed to help couples and others transform chronic conflict into greater closeness and development. In 1983, she and her late husband, Ed Epstein, designed Dialogue Therapy as a new form of couples therapy that combined psychoanalysis, Jungian theory, psychodrama, and gender theory. She has published two books on Dialogue Therapy (1984 and 1993), detailing its theory and methods for clinicians and the general public. She has now re-visioned and updated Dialogue Therapy to include the distinctive combination of psychodrama, Object Relations, and Mindfulness. On January 15, 2019, Shambhala Publications released Love Between Equals: Relationship as a Spiritual Path, a book that offers her vision of personal love as a spiritual path and draws on her experience of 30 years as a Dialogue Therapist and Jungian analyst. She maintains a clinical practice of Jungian analytic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis in Vermont, United States. Life and career Raised as a Catholic, Polly Young-Eisendrath was born and grew up in Akron, Ohio, where she graduated first in her class from Akron East High School. As a teenager, she worked as a long distance telephone operator. Young-Eisendrath attended Ohio University where she met, among other scholars, Huston Smith. Smith's work in comparative religions had a profound and transformative influence on her, leading her to search for a religion that was not fundamentally ritualistic or dogmatic, but experiential and connected with daily life. Buddhism Young-Eisendrath began Zen training in 1970 at the Rochester Zen Center with Philip Kapleau when she became a student of Shinzen Young in 1998. She is currently a Mindfulness and Dharma teacher in the tradition of Shinzen Young, and practices both Soto Zen and Vipassanā, and has also practiced Phowa with Ayang Rinpoche and Anyen Rinpoche. She directs Waysmeet Sangha, a friendship-based Buddhist sangha, which she hosts in Vermont. Education and career Young-Eisendrath attended Ohio University (OU) from 1965–1970 and graduated with a major in English literature. While at OU, she was an Ohio Fellow and a student in the Honors College. She earned a Masters of Arts from Goddard College, a Masters of Social Work in Clinical Social Work and a Ph.D. in Developmental and Counseling Psychology from Washington University. She is also a diplomate Jungian analyst and completed her training through the Inter-Regional Society of Jungian Analysts. She has maintained an independent clinical practice as a psychologist since 1982: in Pennsylvania from 1982 to 1994 and in Vermont since 1992. She has been a clinical associate professor in Psychiatry at the University of Vermont Medical College since 1994 and is a clinical supervisor at the Norwich University Counseling Service. A prolific writer, Young-Eisendrath has published 15 books and numerous academic articles. She is influential in the fields of Jungian analysis, feminist psychology, and the application of Zen Buddhist concepts to psychoanalytic theory.

Epstein died of Alzheimer's disease in 2014 and Young-Eisendrath's memoir of the experience, The Present Heart: A Voyage of Love, Loss and Discovery narrates the process of the disease from the lens of a practicing Buddhist, offering insight into methods of coping with loss, death and grief.

It depicts a part of the artist's family's land in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania in the winter, with patches of ice in the grass. In the foreground is a pile of hay with the remnants of an old hay wagon. Two icy wheel tracks lead to a mill and a granary in the background. Creation In his 1995 autobiography, Wyeth said about this painting that he \\"wanted to capture the clean-swept character of the beginning of the winter after the floods\\". Provenance The painting was acquired by the art dealer Frank E. Fowler and sold to the actor Charlton Heston in 1988. Heston was a friend and promoter of Wyeth and owned several of his paintings. In 1991 he received Wyeth's study for Flood Plain as a Christmas gift from the artist. The painting was sold through Sotheby's in 2015 for 5,178,000 US dollars.

Youth and Education The son of Giuliano Cesarini, duke of Civitanova, and his wife Livia Orsini, he was sent together with his brother Alessandro to study at Parma, where he was hosted by duke Ranuccio I Farnese.Galileo Heretic, Pietro Redondi, Princeton University Press, 1987 p.90 During this period, as a result of a fall from a horse and an inept operation, his health, already delicate, became even more fragile. He returned to Rome in 1610, and pursued a range of interests including theology, jurisprudence, mathematics and astronomy, as was consistent with prevailing ideas about a cultural education, founded on Aristotelian philosophy. Career in Rome He was on friendly terms with Cardinal Robert Bellarmine and Maffeo Barberini (later Pope Urban VIII) as well as with Prince Federico Cesi, patron of the Accademia dei Lincei. In 1618, Cesarini became a member of the Accademia. It was here that he encountered both Galileo and Giovanni Ciampoli. Thus he became familiar with Galileo’s experimental methodology, which had a profound influence on him. He served as chamberlain to Pope Gregory XV, and was confirmed in his post by his successor, Urban VIII and promoted to Chief Chamberlain.The Crime of Galileo, Giorgio de Santillana, University of Chicago Press,1955 p.157 In the Accademia dei Lincei he served as a link between scientists who were working in different cities of Italy, and encouraged Galileo, who was facing criticism from conservative circles. Friendship with Galileo In 1619, the Jesuit Orazio Grassi, writing under the pseudonym Lotario Sassi, published Libra Astronomica ac Philosophica, which attacked Galileo. In May 1622, Cesarini wrote to Galileo asking him to publish a reply to Sarsi, which he owed it to the world to write. In October of the same year, Galileo’s response, The Assayer, was ready. It was published the following year, in the form of a letter to Cesarini. See also *Ferdinando Cesarini, Virginio Cesarini's brother.

It premiered on Showtime on January 15, 2017.  Plot  Sekou Bah (J. Mallory McCree), a young black Muslim-American, posts a series of videos online where he visits locations of past domestic terrorist attacks and chronicles what happened. He is arrested by FBI Special Agent Ray Conlin (Dominic Fumusa) and charged with materially supporting terrorism. Carrie (Claire Danes), now heading up a non- profit organization in New York City that defends the rights of Muslim- Americans against discrimination, meets Sekou and prepares to represent him. Conlin reveals to Carrie that they found Sekou in possession of plane tickets to Nigeria, the base of operations of Boko Haram, and $5,000 in cash hidden under his mattress. Carrie visits Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend) at a veteran's hospital where he is rehabilitating from his exposure to sarin gas in Berlin. Quinn exhibits signs of PTSD and partial paralysis. They get into an argument when Carrie learns that Quinn skipped a physical therapy appointment. When Quinn is reported missing the next day, Carrie tracks him down to a flophouse where he has been smoking crack and having sex with prostitutes, and finds him with a head wound after being mugged for his government check. When Quinn violently resists being readmitted to the hospital, Carrie reluctantly agrees to let him stay with her and Franny, albeit in her downstairs apartment. Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) and Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) brief President- elect Elizabeth Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) on ongoing CIA operations. After the briefing, Dar expresses concern to Saul that Keane might be planning to demilitarize the CIA, noting that Keane's son was killed while serving in Iraq. Saul is more amenable to Keane's point of view. Dar covertly meets Tovah Rivlin (Hadar Ratzon-Rotem) of Mossad and suggests that certain initiatives should be accelerated before Keane's inauguration, only eight weeks away. As the episode concludes, Dar Adal hosts a meeting with General McClendon (Robert Knepper), Senator Coto (Alfredo Narciso) and other officials. Dar and Coto have decided to not include Saul.  Production  The episode was directed by Keith Gordon, and co-written by showrunner Alex Gansa and co-executive producer Ted Mann.  Reception = Reviews  The episode received a rating of 100% with an average score of 7.2 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating \\"Although Homelands premiere episode lacks the show's signature thrills and gimmicks, 'Fair Game' effectively sets the table for future improvement, establishing a powerful sense of time and place and nuanced character moments throughout.\\" Brian Tallerico of New York Magazine rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars, saying it had \\"a pleasantly slow pace... it's an interesting tone-setter for a show that can often be detrimentally hyperactive\\". In praise of the episode's scenery, Tallerico wrote \\"The premiere used New York City beautifully, especially in the bustling background behind Sekou's videos\\" Matt Brennan of Paste reviewed it positively, calling it \\"uneventful\\", but stating \\"despite its dearth of narrative fireworks, tonight’s episode succeeds in setting the table for such developments on two distinct fronts\\". Rupert Friend was named \\"Performer of the Week\\" by TVLine for his performance; they wrote \\"it’s a credit to Friend’s raw, riveting performance that he’s making Quinn’s descent so authentic—and tragic\\".  Ratings  The original broadcast drew 1.1 million viewers. In addition, 1.25 million people watched the premiere in advance via Showtime's on-demand services.

It premiered on Showtime on January 22, 2017.  Plot  Carrie (Claire Danes) and Reda (Patrick Sabongui) consult Sekou (J. Mallory McCree), asking about the $5,000 under his mattress. Sekou claims that it was a loan from his friend Saad (Leo Manzari) so that he could visit his father in Nigeria, though Saad did want Sekou to also have a meeting with an unidentified party in return. At Carrie's request, Max (Maury Sterling) looks into Saad's background and deduces that Saad is actually an informant for the FBI. The court doesn't allow Carrie and Reda any access to Saad, so Carrie tracks down Saad herself and confronts him. Saad admits that he was a gang member who turned informant when arrested, and that his handler, Special Agent Conlin (Dominic Fumusa), had him strike up a relationship with Sekou and offer him the money. Saad stresses that he reported back to Conlin that Sekou was not in any way supporting terrorists. Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) has a sitdown with the President-elect's chief of staff Rob Emmons (Hill Harper). According to Dar, the CIA believes that Iran is assembling an underground nuclear program with the help of North Korea, and that Israel plans to apprehend Iran's liaison, Farhad Nafisi, when he makes a scheduled trip to Abu Dhabi. Saul (Mandy Patinkin) visits Carrie and accuses her of being an advisor to President-elect Keane (Elizabeth Marvel), noting that Keane's views on foreign policy are very reminiscent of Carrie's. Carrie denies it, but later, she is asked and indeed does meet with Keane and Emmons. After being apprised of the situation with Iran, Carrie proposes that Saul be the one to represent the U.S. in Abu Dhabi and talk to Nafisi. Dar Adal obtains photos of Carrie going to see Keane, but opts not to show them to Saul. Quinn (Rupert Friend) refuses to take his medication; as a result, he has a seizure while shopping at the nearby store. When Carrie returns home, Quinn asks to be shown the video of him being exposed to sarin gas, claiming to have no memory of the incident. Carrie shows Quinn the video and recounts how she used the footage to save his life.

The current constitution was approved by referendum on 19 April 2010 and formally adopted on 7 May. Background A constitutional referendum was held on 28 September 1958 as part of a wider referendum across the French Union (and France itself) on whether to adopt the new French constitution; colonies voting to accept it would become part of the new French Community; if rejected, the territory would be granted independence. More than 95% of voters of French Guinea voted against the constitution, with a turnout of 85.5%, making it the only colony to vote no.Schmidt, E (2009) Anticolonial Nationalism in French West Africa: What Made Guinea Unique? African Studies Review History Guinea became an independent nation on 2 October 1958. The first constitution was enacted immediately afterward and was written in some haste. A 15-person commission wrote a draft constitution in 10 days, which was approved by the new national assembly on 10 November 1958 after a mere two hours of debate. However, during the dictatorial reign of the first president, Ahmed Sékou Touré, it was routinely ignored or altered. In 1982, bowing to both international and internal pressure, Guinea adopted a new constitution which included better protections for human rights. After Touré's death in 1984, the government was toppled by a military coup d'état. Another constitutional referendum, held on 23 December 1990, was approved by 98.7% of the voters, paving the way for a third constitution. A 2001 referendum, which was boycotted by the opposition, amended this constitution, removing presidential term limits and lengthening the term from five years to seven. Critics accused then-President Lansana Conté of seeking to remain in power longer. When Conté died in 2008, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara seized power in a coup d'état, but was shot in the head in December 2010. He left the country to receive medical care and recuperate. He later agreed not to come back, and Guinea returned to civilian rule. The current constitution was approved by referendum on 19 April 2010 and formally adopted on 7 May.

Burlington had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. The minesweeper was armed initially with a single quick-firing (QF) /40 caliber Mk IV gun mounted forward that was later replaced with a single QF 20 cwt gun mounted forward.Macpherson (1997), p. 19 The ship was also fitted with a QF 2-pounder Mark VIII aft and was eventually fitted with single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns on the bridge wings.Macpherson (1997), p. 46 Those ships assigned to convoy duty were armed with two depth charge launchers and four chutes to deploy their 40 depth charges. Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1939–40 building programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 4 July 1940 by Dufferin Shipbuilding at their yard in Toronto, Ontario. Burlington was launched on 23 November 1940 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 6 September 1941 at Toronto.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 168 The ship arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia in September 1941 and remained part of the local force until March 1942 when Burlington transferred to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. During the night of 11/12 January 1942, was torpedoed by the German U-boat southeast Cape Sable Island. Burlington and sister ship were sent to aid the stricken. While Red Deer aided the survivors, Burlington unsuccessfully searched for the submarine.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, p. 380 In May 1942, the minesweeper was reassigned to the Gulf Escort Force, escorting convoys through the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Burlington, with the corvette and sister ship , escorted the first Quebec – Sydney convoy, QS 1, through the gulf.Sarty, p. 91 Following the closure of the St. Lawrence River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence to shipping in September following a series of successful U-boat attacks, a special convoy comprising twelve merchants was escorted by Burlington and Red Deer sailed from Sydney to Quebec City. The convoy avoided the main shipping lanes and arrived safely. The successful sailing of this convoy and its sequel gave the Royal Canadian Navy the confidence to reopen the gulf to merchant shipping again in October.Sarty, pp. 197–99 On 21 October the convoy SQ 43 was spotted by west of Cap-Chat, Quebec. The convoy was escorted by Burlington, and two Fairmile motor launches. The submarine was damaged in a counterattack by Gananoque and forced to break off its attack.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, p. 464 On 6 November, the minesweeper was sent to search for a U-boat that had landed an Abwehr agent in Quebec. The agent was captured but the submarine was not intercepted.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, p. 467 In December 1942, Burlington began a refit that was done piecemeal at Halifax, Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia that took until May 1943 to complete. After working up, the minesweeper was assigned to WLEF, joining the convoy escort group W9. Burlington remained with the group until February 1944 when she transferred to the Halifax Local Defence Force as a local patrol and escort vessel. In October 1944, Burlington joined Newfoundland Force operating from St. John's, Newfoundland, remaining with the unit until 8 June 1945 when it was disbanded. The minesweeper was then assigned miscellaneous duties until being paid off on 30 October 1945. Following the war, the minesweeper was sold to T. Harris of New Jersey in 1946 and broken up for scrap.Colledge, p. 110 References=NotesCitationsSources   External links * * Category:Bangor-class minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Ships built in Ontario Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:1940 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of Canada ","title":"HMCS Burlington"},{"id":"52165036","text":"Ulomoides dermestoides is a species of beetle in the family Tenebrionidae, known under a variety of common names, such as Chinese beetle, Chinese weevil, peanut beetle, cancer beetle, or asthma beetle. While native to Asia, it has been spread worldwide due to the belief that it has medicinal properties. History Like other members of the genus Ulomoides, U. dermestoides is a pest of grain and grain products, and is easily reared on bread and similar foodstuffs. Ulomoides dermestoides was widely applied in Japanese and Chinese folk medicines in the treatment of low back pain, cough, and respiratory disorders such as asthma.Chu, G.S.T., J.R. Palmieri, and J.T. Sullivan. 1977. Beetle-eating: A Malaysia folk medical practice and its public health implications. Tropical Geographic Medicine 29: 422–427. The beetle primarily came to international attention around 2000, when news reports emerged that it was being imported and eaten in Argentina and Brazil; beetles were reared at home and distributed through a community network that promoted the consumption of live beetles, with the purpose of alleviating or curing \\"diseases such as asthma, Parkinson's, diabetes, arthritis, HIV and cancer.\\"Rosana Crespo, M. Luciana Villaverde, Juan R. Girotti, Alba Güerci, M. Patricia Juárez, Margarita G. de Bravo. 2011. Cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of defence secretion of Ulomoides dermestoides on A549 cells. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 136 (1): 204–209. doi:10.1016/j.jep.2011.04.056 At that time, it was commonly called \\"the chinese weevil\\" (or \\"gorgojo chino\\"), although it is not related to true weevils. Medical Studies Given that thousands of people were consuming large numbers of these beetles (several thousand per person), the medical community responded with numerous studies, with a variety of results, though none confirming the claims of curative properties. The chemicals, primarily quinones, that the beetles produce as defensive compounds are capable of killing cells (significant cytotoxicity), affecting both healthy and cancerous tissues, and overconsumption of beetles can lead to serious health complications such as pneumonia,Bhupinder S.

The three engineers established the Società Anonima Imprese Metropolitane (S.A.I.M.) to manage the albergo diurno. A monument above it to Guglielmo Oberdan was planned but never built. The square, previously called Piazzale Venezia, was dedicated to Guglielmo Oberdan on July 19, 1923. The decorations, the furniture and a part of the general architecture have been attributed to architect Piero Portaluppi.Il tempo sepolto. L’Albergo Diurno Metropolitano \\"Venezia\\" di Milano tra architettura e arti decorative. Proposte di recupero. Un primo approccio all’arte e all’architettura liberty. Tra conoscenza e restauro, a cura di Cesare Renzo Romeo, L’Artistica Editrice, Savigliano, 2013 The Albergo Diurno was approximately 88 meters long and 14 meters wide circa and occupied a surface of around 1200 sqm. It was divided in two parts, the public baths towards via Tadino and the hall of the artisans towards corso Buenos Aires. The public baths, with an access from the side of via Tadino, occupy two thirds of the length and have six luxury bathrooms with bath tub and the simple baths with shower with access from two parallel corridors. In the main entrance area, heading towards the corso Buenos Aires, one could find a travel agency and a photographer, and the entry to the main hall with two side naves where there were barbers, manicurists and pedicurists. From the door at the end of the hall one could enter the baths section, with a central corridor ending with a bronze statue of Hygeia, goddess of health, made by the sculptor Luigi Fabris. The central corridor is connected to the two corridors of the baths, to the heating room and to a safety exit. In the square two cement columns that contain the smoke chimneys can be seen. Over the access staircases there were two platform roofs but only the one towards via Tadino has been conserved, but without the covering glass. The platform roof towards the corso Buenos Aires was removed when the subway line 1 was built in the 1950s. Access to the Diurno was opened from the staircase to the subway. A part of the entrance hall and the toilets have been demolished. In 1985 the baths were shut down. In 1990 the structure was given in concession to the Consorzio Oberdan Servizi, created by the artisans that worked there. Most of the artisans left the Diurno in the middle of 1990, selling a part of the furniture that they considered their own. The last barber for men, Carmine Aiello, was sent away by Milan on June 16, 2006, for legal reasons. Afterwards, following the break of a skylight by the wheel of a cleaning truck, the skylights were covered with asphalt outside and reinforced inside. In 1995 the company GTS of Bergamo proposed to the Municipality to transform it into a beauty farm. The project was stopped by architect Italo Rota, who became in 1996 assessor to urban quality in the Giunta Formentini and planned its transformation in a shop, conserving the hall, as a part of a project of renewal of Piazza Oberdan and modification of the Porta Venezia station of the subway line 1. The Regional Direction for the Beaux Arts of Lombardy has put the Diurno under restriction as a national monument on October 25, 2005. Milan province, starting from year 2000, asked for the Diurno for the municipality to link it to Spazio Oberdan and put offices and archives of the Cineteca Italiana. The project could have been financed by the earnings of the participation in the Autostrada Serenissima, tied to cultural uses. The municipal government approved on February 3, 2006, the text of a 25-year agreement with the province, but the province never signed it because the money was used for the restoration of the spires of the Duomo di Milano. An attempt of the province to start in 2010 a Programma Integrato di Intervento with the Lombardy Region, the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane and ATM was abandoned for lack of interest by the various institutions. The offices of Cineteca Italiana were later transferred to the ex Manifattura Tabacchi in viale Fulvio Testi. The property of the structure has remained to Milan municipality which thought to restore it with its own funds, at least for the hall of the artists or as an alternative the emission of a bid to rent it to private organizations. Following the publication of a study by Stefano Masi and Pierfrancesco Sacerdoti attributing to Portaluppi the project of the furniture, the Fondo Ambiente Italiano (FAI) and Fondazione Portaluppi have organized a convention on the Diurno at Villa Necchi February 4, 2014. Following this convention FAI, in agreement with the Municipality, opened the Diurno Saturday and Sunday 22 and 23 March 2014 from 10 to 17 as an initiative of the Giornate di Primavera of FAI, after FAI volunteers have cleaned and provided lightning to the Diurno. In July 2015 FAI signed an agreement with Milan Municipality committing itself to plan and collect funds for a project of restoration and opening to the public of Diurno.http://www.comune.milano.it/wps/portal/ist/it/news/primopiano/archivio_dal_2012/lavori_pubblici/pza_oberdan_accordo_fai_albergo_diurno Piazza Oberdan.

This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Isaiah, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. Chapters 40-55 are known as \\"Deutero-Isaiah\\" and date from the time of the Israelites' exile in Babylon. This chapter includes from verse 13 the start of the fourth of the songs of the \\"Suffering Servant\\".  Text  The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 15 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., the Isaiah Scroll (1Qlsa; 356-100 BCE), and of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes Codex Cairensis (895 CE), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Parashot The parashah sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.As reflected in the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English. Isaiah 52 is a part of the Consolations (Isaiah 40–66). {P}: open parashah; {S}: closed parashah. : {P} 52:1-2 {S} 52:3 {S} 52:4-6 {S} 52:7-10 {S} 52:11-12 {S} 52:13-15 {S} Structure The New King James Version organises this chapter as follows: * = God Redeems Jerusalem * = The Sin- Bearing Servant (continuing into as the Sin-Bearing Messiah). Verse 1 :Awake, awake! :Put on your strength, O Zion; :Put on your beautiful garments, ::O Jerusalem, the holy city! :For the uncircumcised and the unclean ::Shall no longer come to you.: NKJV The call, Awake, awake ( ‘ūrî ‘ūrî) repeats the same call heard in and . Israel Citing a number of Biblical verses that refer to Israel as the \\"servant\\", many of them from the Book of Isaiah such as 49:3 He said to me, \\"You are My servant, Israel, in whom I will display My splendor.\\"Isaiah 41:8-9, Isaiah 44:1, Isaiah 44:21, and Isaiah 49:3 Jewish scholars, and several Christian scholarly books, like Revised Standard Version Oxford Study Edition Bible, The Revised Standard Version tell us that Isaiah 53 is about national Israel and the New English Bible echo this analysis. Judaism, teaches that the \\"servant\\" in question is actually the nation of Israel. These scholars also argue that verse 10 cannot be describing Jesus. The verse states: :10he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong [his] days Taken literally, this description, is inconsistent with the short, childless life of Jesus. But there is interpretive room to argue that a resurrected Jesus has prolonged his days indefinitely and that his \\"seed\\" are those who become Christians. The reason that the Servant is referred to in the third person may be that these verses are written from the point of view of Gentile nations amazed at Israel's restoration, or it may simply be a method of figurative description.as in Isaiah 52:15 Supporters of this theory argue that the reason for the use of past tense is based on the differences between Proto-Isaiah and Deutero-Isaiah. Chapters 40–55 of Isaiah are referred to as \\"Deutero-Isaiah\\" because the themes and language are different from the rest of the book, leading some scholars to believe it was written by another author. Deutero-Isaiah differs from Proto-Isaiah in that it refers to Israel as already restored, which could account for the past-tense of the passage. The Servant passages in Isaiah, and especially Isaiah 53, may be compared with Psalm 44. Psalm 44 directly parallels the Servant Songs, making it, probably, the best defense for reading Isaiah 53 as applicable to the nation of Israel. Jewish–Christian relations=Before 1000 The earliest known example of a Jew and a Christian debating the meaning of Isaiah 53 is the example from 248 cited by Origen. In Christian church father Origen's Contra Celsus, written in 248, he writes of Isaiah 53: :Now I remember that, on one occasion, at a disputation held with certain Jews, who were reckoned wise men, I quoted these prophecies; to which my Jewish opponent replied, that these predictions bore reference to the whole people, regarded as one individual, and as being in a state of dispersion and suffering, in order that many proselytes might be gained, on account of the dispersion of the Jews among numerous heathen nations.Origen, Contra Celsum, Book 1.Chapter 55 The discourse between Origen and his Jewish counterpart does not seem to have had any consequences for either party. This was not the case for the majority of centuries that have passed since that time. In Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1:24, written in the 700s, a debate about a much less controversial topic results in the arrest of the Jew engaging in the debate.Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1:24 translated by Christopher P. Benton \\"In Search of Kohelet\\" p 13 1000–1500 In 1263 at the Disputation of Barcelona, Nahmanides expressed the Jewish viewpoint of Isaiah 53 and other matters regarding Christian belief about Jesus's role in Hebrew Scripture. The disputation was awarded in his favor by James I of Aragon, and as a result the Dominican Order compelled him to flee from Spain for the remainder of his life. Passages of Talmud were also censored. In a number of other disputations, debate about this passage resulted in forced conversions, deportations, and the burning of Jewish religious texts. Modern era The use of Isaiah 53 in debates between Jews and Christians still often occurs in the context of Christian missionary work among Jews, and the topic is a source of frequent discussion that is often repetitive and heated. Some devout Christians view the use of the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 in targeted conversion of Jews as a special act of Christian love and a fulfillment of Jesus Christ's teaching of the Great Commission.

Current constitutionConstitutional history=1977-1991 The 1977 constitution (text ) proposed by the government of Ali Soilih was approved by only 55 percent of voters in a October 1977 referendum.. After taking office, Ahmed Abdallah consolidated power, beginning with the writing of a new constitution, approved in 1978 (text ).. The document combined federalism and centralism. It granted each island its own legislature and control over taxes levied on individuals and businesses resident on the island (perhaps with an eye to rapprochement with Mahore), while reserving strong executive powers for the president. It also restored Islam as the state religion, while acknowledging the rights of those who did not observe the Muslim faith.. The new constitution was approved by 99 percent of Comoran voters on October 1, 1978.. Abdallah kept opponents from competing with him by amending the 1978 constitution.. As part of what one observer wryly called the process of \\"remov[ing] his most avid successors from temptation\\", Abdallah pushed through a constitutional amendment in 1985 that abolished the post of prime minister, a move that made the president both head of state and head of the elected government.. The amendment also diminished the status of Ali Mroudjae, the erstwhile prime minister and a likely future candidate for president.. Another 1985 amendment took away many of the powers of the president of the National Assembly, including his right to become interim head of state in the event of the incumbent's death. The amendment transferred the right of succession to the president of the Supreme Court, an appointee of the head of state. In 1989, Abdallah sought a constitutional amendment that would allow him to run for a third term in 1990. The official result of the referendum was a 92.5 percent majority in favor of the amendments proposed by Abdallah, which now created \\"the conditions for a life presidency,\\" warned one opposition leader.. Balloting was marked by the now customary manipulation by the government, and voters reacted angrily to abuses. Leaders of the banned opposition in bold public statements questioned the legitimacy of the referendum. 1992 constitution The Constitution of the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros was approved by referendum on June 7, 1992.. It replaced the constitution of 1978, as amended. Among the general principles enumerated in the preamble were the recognition of Islam as the state religion and respect for human rights as set forth in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. All citizens were declared equal before the law. The president was elected by direct universal suffrage to a five-year term and was limited to two terms. All persons over the age of eighteen who possessed full civil and political rights could vote. The president could be elected to no more than two terms.. The president was both head of state and head of government. The president nominated ministers to form the Council of Government. The president also nominated governors for each of the three islands for five-year terms. If the presidency became vacant, the president of the Supreme Court would serve as interim president until an election could be held. The constitution provided for a bicameral legislature. The forty-two members of the \\"lower\\" house, the Federal Assembly, represented electoral wards for four-year terms. The Federal Assembly met for two forty-five-day sessions per year, in April and October. The upper house, the Senate, had fifteen members, five from each island, who were chosen by an Electoral College. The post of prime minister was held by a member of the party holding a majority of seats in the Federal Assembly. The number of political parties could be regulated by federal law. Areas subject to federal legislation included defense, communications, law, international trade, federal taxation, economic planning, and social services. As a federal republic, Comoros assigned autonomy to the three constituent islands in matters that, in accordance with the constitution, did not come within the purview of the national government. Each island had a council whose members were elected to represent electoral wards for four-year terms. The judiciary was considered independent of the executive and legislature. The Supreme Court examined constitutional issues and supervised presidential elections. The high court also arbitrated when the government was accused of malpractice.. 1996 and 1999 constitutions * 1996 Constitution * 1999 Constitutional Act References=FootnotesWorks cited * External links *Constitution of Comoros *Constitution of Comoros Comoros Category:Politics of the Comoros ","title":"Constitution of the Comoros"},{"id":"52165145","text":"Smooth Jazz Cafe is the seventh solo studio album by guitarist Brian Tarquin, released in October 2014 by Cleopatra Records/Purple Pyramid.

Location Errew Abbey is located on a peninsula stretching into Lough Conn. Templenagalliaghdoo lies immediately to the north. History Tigernan of Errew is said to have founded a monastery here in the early 6th century. It was originally called \\"Mainistir Taobh Thiar do Shruth\\", \\"the abbey on the west side of the stream\\". Up to 1,400 students from all over Europe are claimed to have studied there. It was refounded by the Barretts in the 12th/13th century. Thomas Barrett, Bishop of Elphin, was buried here in 1404. In 1413 the Barretts founded an abbey for the Augustinian Canons, dedicated to the Virgin Mary; they seem to have made use of the buildings from the earlier foundation. Rather than a true abbey, it was more likely a priory cell dependent on Crossmolina Abbey. In 1413, McWattin Barrett violated the sanctuary of Errew to seize Henry Barrett who had taken refuge there. Saint Tigernan is said to have appeared to McWattin every night until he promised to make amends; he gave the abbey an éraic of a quarter of land (ceathrú mír, about 120 acres) at Ballinbraher (Friarstown). A family called O'Flynn were erenachs of the lands at Errew and came into the possession of Mias Tighernain, a paten said to have belonged to Tigernan. Errew Abbey was dissolved in 1585. Building There is a long rectangular church, measuring 27 × 7 m (90' by 22') which has retained some trefoil-headed windows, two sedilia and a piscina. The east side of the cloister is well-preserved, but it does not have the typical open arcade.

Whitehurst, c1861 John Moncure Daniel (October 24, 1825 – March 30, 1865) was the US minister to the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1854-1861. However, he is best known for his role as the executive editor of the Richmond Examiner, one of the chief newspapers of the Confederate States of America. Editorials written by Daniel and his editorial board have served as source materials for historians of the American Civil War. Early life Daniel was born in Stafford County, Virginia on October 24, 1825. He was the son of physician Dr. John M. Daniel and Eliza Mitchell Daniel. The young John discovered a talent for journalism and moved south within his native state to Richmond, Virginia. In 1847, he became one of the first writers for a weekly paper, the Richmond Examiner. Soon, he became a leading writer for the paper. Then, as its editor, he became a patron of Edgar Allan Poe and published several of Poe's poems. Diplomat Daniel, as an editor aligned with the Democratic Party, was appointed in 1853 by the administration of President Franklin Pierce as the United States diplomat to the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1853, Sardinia was a nation within Italy with its capital at Turin. Daniel was titled the chargé d'affaires for the first year of his time in Turin; in 1854, his title was advanced to minister. He was thus present in Italy during the Second Italian War of Independence, when Italian patriots united to secede from the Austrian Empire and create a new country of their own. For Daniel, this was an inspiring sight. His diplomatic stint ended in January 1861. Civil War editor Back home in Richmond, Daniel re- established his editorial control over the Richmond Examiner, which had become a daily periodical. He and many other leading white citizens of Richmond were strong supporters of Southern secession from the United States, and their enthusiasm grew when the new Confederate States of America (CSA) chose Richmond as the fledgling nation's capital city. Daniel looked forward to his paper becoming a leading organ of the new slaveholding republic. To Daniel's dismay, however, the young country had selected Jefferson Davis as its president. Daniel's editorials were less than enthusiastic about Davis from almost the start of his challenged presidency and were even more hostile as the war continued. The Davis administration made various changes to its cabinet and to its ranks of senior generals who were granted field commands, and to the Examiner, every Confederate policy change was wrong and every personnel shift was misguided. John Daniel's passionate advocacy has helped maintain the historical status and legacy of Confederate generals who might otherwise not have been remembered so well, such as Joseph E. Johnston. Daniel's status and hostility to the administration grew to the point that he came to be seen by some as an informal leader of the Confederate opposition. In 1864, after at least one editorial in the Examiner had made hostile insinuations about the insolvency of the Confederacy and the love of CSA treasurer Edward C. Elmore for gambling at faro, the enraged treasurer challenged Daniel to a pistol duel.Washington, D.C. \\"Daily National Republican\\", August 16, 1864, p. 1, col 7; Washington, D.C. \\"Evening Star\\", August 27, 1864, p. 4, col. 1 It was true that the Confederate treasury was empty of gold and silver, but Elmore succeeded in putting some lead into Daniel's leg. In the wake of the dueling wound, Daniel's health rapidly declined. His editorials became despondent and he became a prophet of the defeat of the Confederacy. He died in Richmond on March 30, 1865, at age 39. The CSA and the Richmond Examiner both did not long survive him.

There were 10 constitutional texts and a draft for a federal organization in 1826. Its common elements are the unitary form of state and presidentialism as a form of government. Independence process In this time, statutes pursued guaranteeing the autonomy of the Captaincy General of Chile before the Spanish Crown, and later gaining full independence and consolidating an institutional system. The first texts were only provisional decrees and later became more established normatives. Old Fatherland * Decree for the Provisional Executive Authority. It was redacted and approved by the National Congress. It was in force only in 1811, and derogated by a coup d'état . * Constitutional Decree of 1812. It was approved during the government of José Miguel Carrera. It's viewed as an undisguised, independence declaration because it declared that no one order or act that was outside Chile could be legal, though the Constitutional Decree of 1812 recognized Ferdinand VII as King of Chile. It was derogated in 1813. * Decree for the Provisional Government. It was enacted in 1814 and created the figure of Supreme Director and a seven-member Senate. Derogated when Chile was reconquered by Spain. New Fatherland After the victory over Royalist forces, the Bernardo O'Higgins rule was created: * Provisional Constitution for the Chilean State (1818). It had 143 articles. This charter regulating rights and responsibilities of men in society, freedom, equality and property rights, and enshrined advanced social principles for the period. Executive power resided with the supreme director with multiple powers. The legislature was unicameral and consisted of a Senate of 5 members and alternates (all appointed by the supreme director) who should oversee the executive operations. The judiciary was directed by the Appeal Court and the Supreme Judiciary Court. Attributions of the supreme director, similar of a dictator, caused discomfort amongst his opponents, so a constituent assembly was convened (1822), where the constitution was reformed and a new one was created. * Political Constitution of the Chilean State of 1822. With 248 articles (the largest constitution in the Chilean history). It was created by José Antonio Rodríguez Aldea. It was the first constitution that established a bicameral legislature, meanwhile, the figure of the supreme director as executive power remained, for a 6-year period, with a possibility of reelection for another 4 years. For the most part of the powerful Chilean ruling class, this fundamental charter made the O'Higgins government was intolerable; O'Higgins finally had to abdicate his office in January 1823, and in the final days of that year this constitution was replaced.  Institutional adjustment period  After O'Higgins resignation, there was a time of \\"political learning\\" that produced many constitutional texts that failed to take hold due to successive political crises. * Political and Permanent Constitution of Chilean State (1823). Known also as \\"moralist constitution\\", its principal creator was Mariano Egaña. His nickname \\"moralist\\" came by its normative characteristics that directed the activities of citizens, including private. For this reason and its difficult application in the society at that time, it was suspended in July 1824 and derogated in 1824 by the government of Ramón Freire. * There was a set of Federal Acts in 1826, proposed by José Miguel Infante. Chile was divided into eight provinces with autonomy but without defining clear boundaries, resulting in conflicts between them. Acts were derogated in 1827 during Francisco Antonio Pinto rule. * Constitution of Chile (1828). Called \\"liberal constitution\\" (as opposed to 1833 text), its ideologist was José Joaquín de Mora, joined with Santiago Concha. This text was used as a model for the subsequent constitutions. It noted that it was unenforceable, but problems arose following the 1829 election, to divide national politics between pipiolos (liberals) and pelucones (conservatives) in the presidential election, that later became a civil war that was a conservative victory. The legislature is exercised by a bicameral National Congress, with a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate. The executive branch consists of the president and vice president, which are elected by an indirect vote. The judiciary is filed in the Supreme Court, courts of appeal and courts of the first instance. Consolidated republic After the end of the institutional crisis, Chile began to consolidate its political institutions, while living different influences throughout its history (conservatism, liberalism, populism, etc.). In this period, texts are qualified as \\"authentic\\" constitutions in the sense that define the fundamental rights, establish the relationship between state and citizens, set and regulate the functions of branches of government and their authorities; mechanisms of law creation and constitutional reform. All texts define Chile as a unitary state, the president is both head of state and government, with a bicameral congress and independent judiciary. * The Constitution of the Republic of Chile of 1833 (168 articles, with 7 transitional provisions). It was discussed and approved by a Great Convention in 1833 whose initial mission was to reform the 1828 chart. Written by a commission, on the basis of a draft proposed by Mariano Egaña, and with the outstanding participation of Egaña and Manuel Gandarillas. Approved and promulgated on 25 May 1833. Reformed in 1871, 1873, 1874, 1882, 1888, 1891, 1892 and 1893. It is the most lasting constitutional text in the history of Chile since only was replaced in 1925 after 92 years. * The Constitution of the Republic of Chile of 1925 (110 articles and 10 transitory provisions). Its intellectual authors were Arturo Alessandri and José Maza Fernandez. It was called a Consultative Commission to report regarding the process for \\"reform\\" the Constitution of 1833, from which two subcommissions were formed, one of which prepared the draft, presided by Alessandri and with the participation of Maza. It was approved in the referendum of 30 August 1925, with a high abstention, and promulgated on 18 September of the same year. Entered into force on 18 October 1925, and reformed in 1943, 1957, 1959, 1963, 1967, 1969, 1970 and 1971. Its application was partially suspended by the coup of 11 September 1973, being amended and derogated in part by decree laws (called Actas Constitucionales, \\"Constitutional Acts\\"), until total replacement in 1981. * The Constitution of the Republic of Chile of 1980 (120 articles, with 29 transitory provisions). In its creation were involved: a study commission led by Enrique Ortúzar, the Council of State -where share an important participation the former president Jorge Alessandri, president of the Council-, and the Military Junta. The text was approved in a referendum held on 11 September 1980 and entered into force on 11 March 1981. Reformed in 1989 (by referendum), 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 (by legislature process).

Sassoon travelled extensively with the sole intent of collecting Hebrew books and manuscripts which he later catalogued in a two-volume book, entitled, Ohel David. The vast importance of his private collection of books and manuscripts cannot be overestimated, since it affords scholars the opportunity to examine some twenty-four distinct liturgical rites used by the different Jewish communities of the nineteenth century: Aleppo, Ashkenazi, Egyptian, Italian, North African (Morocco), Tunis, Tlemcen, Karaite, Sefardi (Spanish), Bene Israel, Cochin, Turkish, Yemen, among others.David Solomon Sassoon, Ohel David (vol. 1), Introduction, Oxford University Press : London 1932, p. xxvii () David Solomon Sassoon originally owned some 412 manuscripts and twenty incunables, the rarest of which he retrieved from Baghdad. By 1914, the Sassoon collection numbered 500 manuscripts. Between 1914 and 1932, when the Catalogue was published, the manuscripts grew to 1,220, of which 1,153 are fully described in the Catalogue. When David and his mother visited the Holy Land in 1925, he acquired the Decisions of Rabbi Isaiah ben Mali di Trani the Elder (thirteenth century) on Hullin (MS No. 702, Cat. p. 697). One of the more important manuscripts obtained by him is Sefer Halakhot Pesuḳot of Rabbi Yehudai Gaon, a work that he obtained from a Jew in Yemen in 1911, but written in Babylon or Persia in the ninth or tenth century.David Solomon Sassoon, Ohel David (vol. 1), Preface, Oxford University Press : London 1932, pp. x-xi. (). The Ms. was first published by his son, Solomon David Sassoon, in 1951, and has been published several times since then by other editors. Sassoon also obtained in Yemen a hand-written copy of Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, written in Spain in the fourteenth century (1397).David Solomon Sassoon, Ohel David - Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library, London, vol. 2, Oxford University Press:London 1932, pp. 996–998, Ms. No. 1047; ibid. vol. 1, Preface, p. xi. (). The same manuscript had been in the possession of an Italian Jew in the fifteenth century. Of the sixteen liturgical works (siddurim) that Sassoon obtained in Yemen, the earliest dates back to the early 16th-century (1531 CE). A study of these manuscripts reveal that the liturgy used by the Jews of Yemen underwent changes after Western influences penetrated into the Peninsula. Perhaps the most prized of Sassoon's acquisitions is the Farhi Bible, a codex which he purchased in Aleppo. It is said to have been written by Elisha Crescas in Provence between the years 1366 and 1383. It is now kept in a bank vault in Switzerland.The Farhi Bible. Another treasure retrieved by Sassoon is the Damascus Pentateuch, a codex which he bought in Damascus in 1915, and which was acquired by the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem in 1975. A particularly significant acquisition in September 1923 was the Diwan of Samuel Hanagid (MS No. 589, Cat. pp. 451–460), which the Oxford University Press published with an introduction by Sassoon in 1924. Samuel ha-Levi b. Joseph ibn Nagrela (993-1056) died ten years before the Norman Conquest of England. Many of the manuscripts and incunabula collected by David Sassoon were auctioned by Sotheby's of London in Zurich and in New York, between the years 1975 - 1994, in order to satisfy the Sassoon estate's British tax obligations.David Sassoon - The Bibliophile of Bombay Today, most of what remains of David Solomon Sassoon's private collection of Hebrew manuscripts is stored at the University of Toronto, in Canada, although a small cluster of manuscripts from the estate of David Solomon Sassoon are now at the British Library, which were either offered to the library in lieu of tax, or were purchased at Sotheby's auction sales in the 1970s. His son, Solomon David Sassoon (1915–1985), was an educator, Rabbi, philanthropist and fundraiser, and also a collector of Jewish manuscripts.

It is not part of the judicial branch and is functionally independent of the Congress and the President.  History  The Constitutional Court was created in 1970, under the Constitution of 1925. In 1973, after the coup d'état, it was dissolved, but the 1980 Constitution reinstated it. Until 2005, some members were designated by the National Security Council (a civic-military committee).  Attributions  According to the Chilean constitution, its principal attribution is to rule on whether laws that are challenged are in fact unconstitutional, i.e., whether they conflict with constitutionally established rights and freedoms. This function not only applies to legislative acts, but also to judicial decrees (autoacordados), presidential decrees (Decretos con Fuerza de Ley), or even ordinary decrees when the Comptroller-General deems it to be unconstitutional. Also, the Court has attributions on the convocation to referendums, outlawing groups or parties which seriously violate the institutional order, deposing members of Congress who seriously infringe the constitution, resolving conflicts between lower courts and administrative agencies, and many others.  Ministers  The Constitutional Court is composed of ten members, called Ministers: * 3 appointed by the President of the Republic * 3 elected by the Supreme Court * 2 elected by the Senate by a two-thirds majority * 2 proposed by the Chamber of Deputies by a two-thirds majority and confirmed by the Senate by the same margin Members have nine-year terms, renewed by thirds every three years, and can not be re-elected. The Constitutional Court can work as a United Court (Pleno) or divided in two Chambers (Salas). In the event a quorum is below the legally required, deputy ministers (ministros suplentes), or substitute attorneys (abogados integrantes) are designated. The court's president has the power to break a tie.

FIS is a recessive genetic disease. Affected foals appear normal at birth, but become weak, and either die or are euthanized by three months of age due to persistent infections caused by immunodeficiency. Symptoms Affected foals are healthy when born. By one month of age, foals become depressed, lose weight, and have diarrhea, and a cough with nasal discharge. The diarrhea and cough initially improve in response to treatment, but then worsen as treatment becomes ineffective. The foal's coat becomes dry and staring and the foal weakens further by two months of age as the foal fails to suckle, and by the age of 3 months, the foal dies (or is euthanized), giving this disease a 100% mortality rate. Genetics FIS is a recessive genetic disease; affected foals are homozygous for the affected gene, that is, they have two copies of the gene, one inherited copy inherited from each parent. For this to occur, both parents must be carriers of the gene. In 2010, 39% of Fell ponies and 18% of Dales ponies tested prior to breeding carried the affected gene. The mutation is also found in approximately 9% of US and European Gypsy horses. A single nucleotide polymorphism (mutation), in the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter (SLC5A3) gene causes FIS. This gene is crucial in regulating a cell's response to osmotic stress; an alteration to the function of the gene leads to failure of red blood cell production (erythropoiesis) and failure of the immune system. Diagnosis and treatment Genetic testing will diagnose whether the foal has FIS. There is no effective treatment for the infections that the foal develops; euthanasia is the preferred option. History The disease was first reported in 1996. The first cases were found in Fell ponies, and the disease was initially termed \\"Fell pony syndrome.\\" The disease appeared to have a genetic component, and, after hereditary diseases known to affect other horse breeds were investigated, it was concluded that this was a newly identified disease. The cause of disease was tracked down using a genome-wide association study, which implicated a region on horse chromosome 25. This chromosome was sequenced in five affected horses, and in 2009, a mutation was discovered in the SLC5A3 gene. Shortly after this, a genetic test was launched for horse owners to identify whether their ponies were carriers. Outlook For the affected Fell and Dales pony breeds, genetic testing of ponies prior to mating can ensure that carriers are never mated together, which will prevent affected foals from being born. Over time, the frequency of the disease gene will decrease, without having an adverse impact on the genetic variation of the pony population.

It was founded by members of the Connecticut Eastern Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society. The museum is home to a replica Columbia Roundhouse built in 2000. It holds many exhibits, including the former train station for Chaplin, twelve diesel-electric trains, and four steam locomotives. The Air Line Trail runs along the edge of the property, as did the Connecticut Eastern railroad for which the museum is named. The roundhouse contains a 60-foot Armstrong Turntable. Structures on Site= Columbia Junction Roundhouse  The original Columbia Junction roundhouse was constructed in 1892 and was torn down in the 1930s. The site was cleared of trees and debris in 1991, and the museum was established in 1995. The museum was able to reconstruct the roundhouse as part of a $400,000 grant package secured by Senator Donald Williams in 1998, as well as to complete site improvements and bring utilities to the property. The exterior walls were reconstructed in 2000, using the original foundation as a base. A special ceremony was held on June 10, 2001 to lay the cornerstone. Exterior doors were hung the following year. The roundhouse is now home to some of the museum's historic collection of trains. A replacement 60-foot, manually operated turntable was purchased from Edaville Railroad in 1994, moved to the site, and installed by museum volunteers.  Willimantic Section House  A section house was used to store tools and equipment used by maintainers who were in charge of a \\"section\\" of track as their territory. This former New Haven Railroad section house was located in Willimantic, and moved to the museum site in 1992. It was restored the following year and is used by museum volunteers to store tools.  Groton Freight House  This former New Haven freight house was once located in Groton, Connecticut along the main line opposite Groton tower, on property belonging to Amtrak and no longer needed. Amtrak donated the structure to the museum in 1998; it was moved there in 1999 and restored by volunteers.  Chaplin Station  This building was first used as a train station in 1872 by the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad to serve Clarks Corner, just across the town line from Chaplin, Connecticut. It was originally built as a commercial building, possibly a tin shop, and later converted for use as a train station for the small community. The BH&E; became a part of the New Haven by 1898. The station was replaced by a larger structure in 1901, and the station master purchased the old building and had it moved to his backyard. The family later donated the station to the museum and it was relocated in 1995.  Versailles Operator's Shanty  This small shanty housed a telegraph operator who would relay orders between the dispatcher and train crews. This shanty was located in Versailles, Connecticut, and was used by the New Haven Railroad. When the telegraph station was closed, it was purchased by an employee who had it moved to his property. It was donated and moved to the museum in 2000, where it is currently used as a ticket booth and information center.

He is best known for a series of experiments in purification and crystallization of proteins, contributing to the determination that enzymes are proteins. Early life and education Kunitz was born in Slonim (then part of Russia, now in Belarus) on December 19, 1887. He was raised and educated there until his move to the United States, where he settled in New York City in 1909 and became an American citizen in 1915. Kunitz graduated from Cooper Union with a degree in chemistry in 1916 and then enrolled there for graduate school in electrical engineering. After three years in the program, he moved to Columbia University, from which he received a Ph.D. in biological chemistry in 1924. Kunitz began work as a technical assistant in Jacques Loeb's laboratory at Rockefeller University in 1913 and continued there throughout his graduate years. Loeb arranged for Kunitz to receive a staff appointment at Rockefeller after graduation. Academic career Kunitz' position at Rockefeller was originally secured by Jacques Loeb. After Loeb died in 1924, John H. Northrop succeeded him and retained Kunitz' position; the two would collaborate extensively on experiments involving protein crystallization for much of their remaining careers. Both Northrop and Kunitz moved to Rockefeller's Princeton, New Jersey campus in 1926; Kunitz returned to New York City in 1952. He then assumed professor emeritus status but continued to work regularly in the laboratory until eventually retiring in 1970. Kunitz was awarded the Carl Neuberg Medal in 1957 in recognition of his long research career and noted technical skill in the laboratory, which was critical to his long series of successes in protein crystallization. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1967. Research Kunitz is best known for his efforts in protein crystallization, successfully crystallizing a number of enzymes and enzyme precursor proteins, particularly proteases. Kunitz worked with trypsin and chymotrypsin and their precursors, as well as pepsin. He also studied protease inhibitors and devoted particular effort to the soybean trypsin inhibitor; the inhibitor protein, its domain family, and a soybean cultivar lacking this protein are all named after him. For their role in isolating, purifying, and crystallizing enzymes - a subject underscored by Kunitz' work with Northrop - John H. Northrop, Wendell M. Stanley, and James B. Sumner were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946. Kunitz himself was nominated three times for a share of a Nobel for this work. In addition to his work on crystallization of proteases, Kunitz also performed careful work in enzymology, characterizing the kinetics and thermodynamics of protease reactions. He worked on other proteins as well, in particular ribonucleases, which were popular model systems for their small size and ease of crystallization. During World War II he worked on government-assigned crystallization projects and was noted for the facility with which he crystallized hexokinase. Kunitz was widely recognized specifically for his craftsmanship and technical skill in the laboratory.

Biography Weinberg was born in Czerkasy, Russia (now Poland) in 1901, the eldest son of Bernard Weinberg and Cecilia Livatkoff Weinberg. The family emigrated to the Philadelphia in 1904, and several of Weinberg's younger siblings were born in the United States. After initially being rejected for being underweight, he joined the United States Army and fought in France in the First World War. He was wounded in battle by machine gun fire and spent a year recovering from his injuries. After attempting to join the Philadelphia Police Department, he attended Temple University and became involved with local Democratic Party politics. He married the former Lena Feingold in 1926. After college, Weinberg worked as a real estate appraiser in the inheritance tax section of the State Auditor General's office. In 1939, he was one of three Democrats nominated for City Council in the 1st district, but Republicans took all three available spots in a close election. Three years later, he was elected Democratic ward leader of the 39th ward. Weinberg was named an assistant state treasurer in 1943. He served as a delegate to the 1952 Democratic National Convention. In 1953, Weinberg resigned as ward leader in order to remain on the city payroll as the new city charter, passed in 1951, barred municipal employees from political work (his wife became ward leader in his stead). In 1955, Governor George M. Leader appointed him Deputy Secretary of Insurance, a job with no such prohibition. Two years later, Leader fired Weinberg along with several other political appointees who were found, as The Philadelphia Inquirer reported, to have \\"enjoyed immunity from supervision and control and were permitted to pursue their private enterprises in addition to their State duties.\\" Despite the scandal, the Democratic party bosses in Philadelphia nominated Weinberg for City Council in the special election called in 1957 for the 1st district seat of Thomas I. Guerin, who died the year before. The nomination drew criticism from reform-minded Democrats, including United States Senator (and former Philadelphia mayor) Joseph S. Clark, Jr., who said the nomination showed \\"contempt for the independent vote.\\" Weinberg's nomination also disappointed Guerin's widow, Mary C. Guerin, who ran as an independent. Guerin noted that Weinberg had been fired from his state job for good reason, saying \\"one would suppose that Governor Leader did not fire him for being late for work.\\" Despite the split in Democratic support, Weinberg achieved a clear victory over Guerin and their Republican opponent, John Donnelly. In Council, Weinberg joined Council President James H. J. Tate in urging the state to speed up construction of the Delaware Expressway, which would run through his district. In 1959, he ran for a full term on City Council and was elected by nearly a 2:1 margin over his Republican opponent, Nunzio Carto, Jr. Weinberg was appointed chairman of the transportation and public utilities committee. He continued his involvement in transportation issues, urging a route option for the Delaware Expressway that would require the demolition of fewer homes. His suggestions were not adopted, and Weinberg was the only dissenting vote when Council gave its approval the state plan in 1962. In 1963, Weinberg was called to testify in grand jury investigations into graft and bribery in city government. He was nevertheless renominated by the Democrats in the election that year and defeated his Republican opponent, Alvin J. Bello, albeit with a decreased majority. In 1966, Weinberg was hospitalized with heart problems and announced he would not seek another term on City Council in the next year's election. He died a month later at Einstein Medical Center, and was buried in Shalom Memorial Park in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. He was survived by his wife Lena and three sons. His son, Marty Weinberg, became a lawyer in Philadelphia and aide to former mayor Frank Rizzo who ran for Mayor of Philadelphia in 1999.

It is within the Rocky Mountain National Park, which lies between Estes Park to the east and Grand Lake, Colorado on the west. Horseshoe Park is home to bighorn sheep, elk and other wildlife, and it is a wetland sanctuary for wide variety of birds. Recreational activities include picnicking, hiking, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Roaring River, Lawn Lake and Crystal Lake are located here. An inn was operated in the area for almost 25 years, until 1931, when the inn was purchased by the federal government. After the inn was removed, the land returned to its natural state. From 1933 to 1942, the Civilian Conservation Corps operated a camp in Horseshoe Park, and the men removed beetle-infested trees, built and improved trails and campgrounds, and other projects.

The sheep come down from the high country, cross the road and graze for up to an hour or more before returning to the high mountains. Courtesy of Rocky Mountain National Park The park is in the lower elevations of Rocky Mountain National Park, within in the montane ecosystem of forests and grasslands. The U-shaped valley was formed by the movement of a 500-foot thick glacier over hundreds of years. About 15,000 years ago, the glacier pushed through the valley, receded, was deposited rubble into a terminal down the valley and when it melted a lateral moraine remained. The sediment left behind from melted waters became the meadows of Horseshoe Park and deep depressions created Sheep Lakes there, where bighorn sheep congregate. Sheep Lakes is located at above sea level. History=Prehistory Elk have been coming to the area since the melting of the Pinedale glaciers about 13,000 years ago. Vegetation grew to support large herds of elk, bighorn sheep, deer, pronghorn antelope, and bison. Native Americans hunted wildlife there. Early 20th-century In the early 1900s, William H. Ashton left Massachusetts for Estes Park. He built the Horseshoe Inn to serve as many as 115 guests. He also owned and operated a lodge at Lawn Lake. The inn was purchased by the government in 1931 and razed to restore the terrain for wildlife. On June 30, 1932, it was officially named Horseshoe Park by the National Park Service. See the Decision Card. Civilian Conservation Camp Little Horseshoe Park became the site of a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) base beginning in May 1933. The initial crew of unmarried young men instigated a riot since they arrived before sufficient food, clothing, bedding and other supplies had arrived. Once the supplies arrived, another blizzard ruined the camp's tents. Civilian Conservation Corps camp, 1933-1942, Horseshoe Park, Rocky Mountain National Park The following day, 100 men rallied and cut down trees infested by beetles. The camp held just under 200 men. Some men left the program, but a lot of them remained due to lack of economic opportunities during the Great Depression. The corps improved the park. They built and improved trails and campgrounds. The corps removed buildings and structures to return the land to its natural habitat. Park buildings were landscaped and telephone lines were installed. The CCC camp disbanded in 1942, when the federal program was shut down. Flood of 1982 Alluvial Fan Falls The flood of July 15, 1982, called the \\"great washout\\", sent 39 million gallons of water down Roaring River and into Estes Park. A wall of water, estimated at high, flowed from the river's source at Crystal Lake, through the river to Lawn Lake, before a confluence with Fall River in Horseshoe Park. The collapse of the Lawn Lake Dam in 1982 scoured the river's channel and deposited an alluvial fan of debris. One person was killed as he slept along the river and two others died in a campground. The water continued to flow through Fall River into Estes Park, where it broke through two dams. Now, trees stumps and other woody debris remain at the high water line of the flood. Attractions Courtesy of Rocky Mountain National Park The road to the western portion of Horseshoe Park leads to West Horseshoe Park, a trailhead to Lawn Lake trail, the Alluvial Fan, Endovalley Picnic Area, and Old Fall River Road. The Lawn Lake trail follows the Roaring River to Lawn Lake and Crystal Lake. During the winter, there is cross-country skiing and snowshoeing through Endovalley. Little Horseshoe Park, an overlook near Deer Ridge Junction, and Fan Lake are also located within Horseshoe park. Wildlife Elk herd strolling through grassland and males fighting for dominance of the herd (video) Elk graze in Western Horseshoe Park at dawn and dusk. In autumn, males make mating calls and engage in fights with other bull elk to establish dominance among the herd. A large wetland supports a variety of birds, including robins, mountain bluebirds, red-winged blackbirds, warblers, hummingbirds, warbling vireos, song sparrows, and thrushes. Due to environmental damage by tourists that reduced the size of the sanctuary, the wetlands were conferred protective status in 1972.

It is located on Gadaladenyia Road (B116), just up from the Gadaladeniya junction of the Colombo - Kandy Road (A1), approximately to the west of Kandy and from the ancient buddhist temple, Lankatilaka Vihara. It is considered one of the largest rock temples in Sri Lanka. History The history of the temple goes back to the 14th century. According to historical reports this temple was built in 1344, under the patronage of King Bhuvanekabahu IV, who reigned from 1341 to 1351 A. D., by the Ven. Seelavamsa Dharmakirti. The architecture of the temple was designed following Hindu artistic styles by, Ganesvarachari, a South Indian architect. On the rock outcrop, upon which the temple stands, is a carved inscription regarding the temple's construction. The temple was constructed in the Dravidian architectural style incorporating Sinhalese architecture from the Polonnaruwa era and other Indo Chinese architectural patterns. Celebrated scholarly monks who have resided at the temple include Sangharaja Dharmakirti II, the author of the Sangharaja-Nikāya (14-15th century) and Vimalakirti I. The temple was abandoned until King Vira Parakrama Narendra Sinha (1707-1739) handed over it to Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero, whose pupils have looked after the temple ever since. Main shrine left The central temple building is unique in that it is built entirely of sculptured granite, except for two shikharas which are built of brick, and sits on a massive stone slab. The sikharas, which are located above the sanctum begins in an octagonal shape but has been given the features of a dagoba. After the original construction of the temple building, possibly in the 18th or 19th century, a multi-tiered and tiled Sinhalese roof, resting on brick piers and wooden pillars, was added to the temple, concealing the flat roof and the shikharas. At the entrance to the shrine room is an elaborately ornate sculptured Makara Thorana (Dragon's Arch). The Makara Thorana is decorated with images of Brahmā, Śakra, Santuṣita, Saman, Santhusthika, Natha and Maitreya. Inside the shrine room is a high statue of a seated Buddha, in the 'Dhyana Mudra’ pose, the posture of meditation associated with his first enlightenment, with four standing Buddha statues flanking it. The statue is significantly different from those of the Gampola period (1314–1415). Adjacent to the main shrine room, on its north side, is a devale dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. The devale was originally dedicated to Varuna when it was built however as Vishnu became more popular with devotees the shrine to Varuna was replaced with Vishnu. Secondary shrine In the middle of the temple compound is a secondary shrine, the Vijayothpaya or Vijayantha Prasada named after the mythical palace of god Indra. The shrine was constructed after the main shrine by King Parakramabahu V. The shrine consists of a central stupa, approximately high built on a square platform. The entire stupa is covered by a four-sided roof supported by four stone pillars. On the four sides of the main stupa are four smaller matching stupas, extending in cruciform angles out in the four cardinal directions. Each of these four smaller stupas are built on stone platforms with their own individual shrine rooms. These shrines formerly housed images of the Four Heavenly Kings: Vaishravaṇa, Virūḷhaka, Dhrutharashṭa and Virūpaksha but now houses statues of the seated Buddha.

After the spring of 1942 this army was on a relatively quiet sector of the front, where the division could rebuild and remedy its early deficiencies in equipment and training. Colonel Sokolov remained in command until October 5, when he handed over his position to Col. Yuri Mikhailovich Prokovev for most of the month. Sokolov took command again on November 2, and on February 14, 1943, he was promoted to the rank of Major General. On February 25, Western Front was ordered to prepare an offensive by 10th and 50th Army in the direction of Roslavl and Yelnya; this order was modified two days later. In the event it was never carried out, due to developments to the south.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 259, 302  Battles for Smolensk and Belorussia  On August 4, General Sokolov handed his command to Col. Ivan Ivanovich Oborin. The 330th took part in Operation Suvorov, the grinding offensive westward towards Smolensk, which began on August 7, but did not involve 10th Army until three days later. On August 10 the commander of Western Front, Col. Gen. V. D. Sokolovsky, ordered the Army to attack north-west out of its salient around Kirov against the LVI Panzer Corps. The command of the German 4th Army was not expecting an attack from this direction, and three rifle divisions, the 247th, 290th and 330th were able to punch through the left flank of the 321st Infantry Division and advance 5 km on the first day. This was the first breakthrough achieved in the offensive, but 10th Army did not have a mobile group to exploit it. 9th Panzer Division was ordered to intervene, but before it could arrive the Soviet divisions began to roll up the 131st Infantry Division, and the right flank of 4th Army began falling back to secondary positions.Robert Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed. Later that month the division was assigned to 38th Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 78 Colonel Oborin was replaced by Col. Vladimir Aleksandrovich Gusev on September 27. Gusev would command the division for the duration of the war, and would be promoted to the rank of Major General on September 13, 1944. In early October, as Western Front made its first attempt to liberate Orsha, 10th Army was on the Front's left flank, and 38th Corps deployed into positions in the bend of the Pronia River southeast of Chausy.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 69-70 In November the division was withdrawn into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding. In December it returned to the line, now in 70th Rifle Corps. By the beginning of January 1944, that Corps had advanced well past the Pronia, outflanking Chausy well to the south and west. To the south of 10th Army, the 3rd and 50th Armies were making substantial gains in the direction of Bykhov. Therefore, Western Front ordered 10th Army to conduct a two-pronged attack against the defenses of German XII Army Corps north and south of Chausy. The attack on the north flank began on January 3, but only gained 1.5 - 2km in two days fighting. In the south, 38th Rifle Corps was in first echelon, and as it also made only minor gains, 70th Corps in second echelon was not committed, and the entire operation was shut down on January 8.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 411-13, 415-16 By late March, 10th Army had been transferred to 1st Belorussian Front, and 70th Corps was now located northeast of Chausy. Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky ordered a further attempt to advance and take Chausy by 10th and 50th Armies to begin on March 25. In the event the 330th, attacking alongside the 290th Rifle Division north of the city, failed to make any appreciable progress.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 526-31 In early April, 10th Army was transferred back to Western Front, and then withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. Later that month the Front was split into 2nd and 3rd Belorussian Fronts. 10th Army was disbanded, with its headquarters taking control of 2nd Belorussian Front and its divisions being assigned to 49th Army in that same Front. The 340th would remain in this Front for the duration of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 78 At the beginning of June, the 330th was still in 70th Rifle Corps,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 162 but prior to the start of Operation Bagration on June 23, the division had been transferred to 62nd Rifle Corps in the same army.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, p. 164 On June 25 the 330th took part in the long- delayed liberation of Chausy, on the way to Mogilyov. After intense fighting by elements of both the 49th and 50th Armies, Mogilyov was taken on June 28, and the division was awarded the name of the city as an honorific: On July 10 the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in recognition of its role in the liberation of those same towns and cities.  Advance  A few days later the division was transferred again, this time to 121st Rifle Corps in 50th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 192 The 330th would remain in this army until January 1945, serving also in 69th and 81st Rifle Corps. As 2nd Belorussian Front advanced into western Poland and eastern Germany, the division was a \\"fire brigade\\", serving in the Front reserves, 70th Army, and also back in 70th Corps of 49th Army. It ended the war under these commands at Gransee, due north of Berlin.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", pp. 78-79  Postwar  The men and women of the 330th ended the war with the official title of 330th Rifle, Mogilyov, Order of the Red Banner Division.

Thailand currently has a quota of 3,211.9 million SDR's, which gives it the second most voting power in its constituency after Turkey. The IMF opened a technical assistance office in Thailand in 2012 to provide technical assistance and training to the Lao PDR and the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.  IMF Involvement in the 1980's  During the span between 1973 and 1985, Thailand experienced a 36% fall in trade, stagnating GDP growth, sharp inflation, and increasing current account deficit coupled with increasing external debt. In order to counter this trend, Thailand entered into IMF backed adjustment program in which it devalued its currency while implementing stricter fiscal policies. The structural changes that this period of adjustment implemented resulted in 10 years of strong economic performance. Between 1987 and 1989, the GDP grew at over 10%, inflation dropped to just 5 percent, and current account deficit was less than 3% of the GDP. Despite this, some argue that the short-term focused structural changes in the 1980s were the catalysts for Thailand's economic crisis just 10 years later in 1997. Specifically, most of the growth in the ten years following the 1983 IMF adjustments were in the non-tradable sector rather than the export- oriented tradable sector. Furthermore, the IMF adjustments cut infrastructure investment from 8.9% of total GDP to just 5.2% in 1989.  IMF Involvement during the Asian Financial Crisis  In 1997, Thailand faced an economic crisis stemming from a variety of pressures. During the ten-year span between 1987 and 1997, Thailand's current account deficit continued to grow. By 1996, the deficit had grown to 7.887% of the total GDP. During this same period, foreign direct investment increased sharply as continuing currency devaluations, first in the 1980s and then as an effect of the Plaza Accord. Real estate investors overestimated the demand for real estate and used the Bangkok International Banking Facility's relatively cheap loans on construction projects that were left vacant due to lower demand than initially thought. Predicting further currency devaluation, speculators launched a series of attacks on the Thai Baht. The Thai government initially attempted to protect the Baht by buying it back and expending its international reserves, but was ultimately forced to float the currency. In August 1997, the IMF unveiled a relief package for Thailand that would offer a total of 17.2 billion US dollar's worth of bilateral and multilateral assistance. The initial period of policy-making was designed to manage the baht's floating exchange rates, restructure Thai financial institutions, cut public expenditures, promote the private sector, and to attract more foreign capital. The IMF's conditionality for the Thai bailout is characterized by monetary policy reform, fiscal policy reform, and financial sector reform. Under Thailand's former finance minister, Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, Thailand's financial sector restructuring began with the liquidation of insolvent finance companies and resulted in the closure of 56 bankrupt finance companies. The government intervened in weak banks and the banking system was recapitalized. In 1998, the banks who received government intervention were privatized, assets were disposed of, and corporate debt was restructured. Bankruptcy law, foreclosure procedures, and foreign investment restrictions were all reformed. Fiscal policy initially demanded a surplus of 1 percent of GDP at the outset of the crisis, but by February 1998 switched its target to a small deficit of 2 percent of GDP. Finally, monetary policy attempted to stabilize the exchange rate while helping Thailand recover from the crisis.  IMF Capacity Development Office Thailand  The IMF opened a Technical Assistance Office in Thailand (TAOLAM) in September 2012 to provide support for Laos and Myanmar, and now also covers Cambodia and Vietnam on a project-by-project basis. Thailand and Japan donate to the upkeep of this office, and the Bank of Thailand hosts the office. The office offers resident project technical advisers in macroeconomic management, public financial management, regional treasury management, monetary and foreign exchange operations, government finance statistics, and external sector statistics. This office works closely with the IMF-Singapore Regional Training Institute (STI) and the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific in Tokyo (OAP). On September 10, 2018, TAOLAM was renamed to the IMF Capacity Development Office in Thailand (CDOT). The name change reflects the complementary role that training plays with technical assistance, as the two pillars of capacity development at the IMF. The principal objective of CDOT has remained to strengthen capacity in macroeconomic management and statistics in support of countries’ reform priorities. CDOT’s activities are made possible through direct financial support from the Government of Japan and an in-kind contribution from the Bank of Thailand.

It was centered around a textiles mill constructed by Francis Henry Fries at the end of the 19th century. In 1911 the mill burnt down. Most of the population moved their homes to Mayodan, North Carolina and the area was left abandoned. History=Establishment Mayo-Avalon Mills Advertisement from 1910 In 1887, Francis Henry Fries, a prominent businessman from Winston- Salem, constructed the Roanoke and Southern Railway, which stretched from his home town to Roanoke, Virginia. Seeking to develop industry along the rail line, Fries erected the Mayo Mill adjacent to the Mayo River in 1895 and established the town of Mayodan. The Mayo Mill could not keep up with demand for yarn, so from 1899–1900 a new mill was built two miles to the north. W. C. Ruffin, the superintendent of the Mayo Mills Company, gave it the name Avalon, after Avalon, California. Construction was undertaken by S. S. Ordway & Sons, an independent contractor. At the time the four-story building was the largest textile mill in North Carolina. The south wall of the main building was made of wooden planks so it could be dismantled to allow for expansions and renovations. A village arose around the mill, taking its name. It was home to over 450 people, of whom over half worked in the mill. Some residents immigrated from as far as Durham and Raleigh to find employment in Avalon. A few African-Americans also lived at the outskirts of the village and worked in the mill's dye house. In addition to the mill, the town consisted of a dam and artificial canal, 60 company houses, a boarding house, a hotel, a company store, an ice cream parlor and a Moravian Church. The second story floor of the store was used to host a school. Electricity came from a water-powered generator at the mill. No formal government was ever established in Avalon, so most events were either centered around the church or the mill. On November 23, 1908 a fire destroyed the company store, causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. Mill fire and aftermath Just before 6:00 PM on June 15, 1911 a spinning mule box on the fourth floor of the mill overheated and caught fire. Wind passing through the open windows fanned the flames and increased the severity of the fire. The mill was just about to close for the day when the fire was discovered, and few employees were in the building at the time. One man vainly attempted to control the blaze by throwing water onto it. The mill had a modern fire sprinkler system, but its water pumps failed and the entire complex burnt down in a few hours. Though it was fully insured, Fries decided not to rebuild it and instead reinvested the insurance payout in the Mayo Mill, transferring his employees and resources there. Almost all of the company houses were put on logs and rolled by mules and horses to Mayodan. By 1913 only the Moravian Church, the mill store, and a single house remained in Avalon. The former two were dismantled and their lumber taken to Mayodan. The house was left behind to host the caretaker of the mill's power plant. In 1916, Fries briefly returned to the site of the mill to dismantle the dyeing equipment and transport it to the Mayo Mill. The remains of Avalon are situated about a mile from U.S. Route 220 on private property.

The school was not re- opened until 1952, when it was temporarily housed at Vancouver Buddhist Church before returning to the VJLS building in 1953. The existing building located on 475 Alexander Street in Vancouver is designated as a heritage building by the City of Vancouver as a symbol of Japanese-Canadian community and the internment.Vancouver Heritage Register, City of Vancouver The building was named a National Historic Site on June 20, 2019, for its role as the oldest and largest Japanese language school in the country, but also because it is a rare documented case of property returned to Japanese-Canadians following the period of internment.Canada Announces New National Historic Designations, Parks Canada news release, June 20, 2019 ReferencesExternal links *Vancouver Japanese Language School and Japanese Hall Category:Educational institutions established in 1906 Category:1906 establishments in British Columbia Category:Japanese-Canadian culture Category:Organizations based in Vancouver Category:Heritage buildings in Vancouver ","title":"Vancouver Japanese Language School"},{"id":"52166221","text":"People first began to be interested in Malawi's prehistoric past in the 1920s. Excavations of sites in nearby countries, Tanzania and Zambia, made archaeologists believe that they may find the same type of material culture in Malawi. In the 1920s, a series of lacustrine deposits was found at the northwest end of Lake Malawi. These beds contained fragmentary fossils and were mapped by Dr. F. Dixey. These findings sparked an interest to excavate more locations in Malawi.405x405px  Early Stone Age = Uraha  Uraha is an Early Stone Age site in Uraha Hill, northern Malawi. It is part of the Chiwondo Beds site which is where the fossil remains were found on the lake beds. It is known for the discovery of a jawbone of an ancient human dating to 2.4 million years ago. This specimen is one of the oldest occurrences of the genus Homo and is assumed to be of the species Homo rudolfensis. The recovery of this bone helped create a connection between sites of East and South Africa. There were no stone tools found but, animal fossils revealed a pattern of habitat change between about 4 and 1.5 million years ago when the land became more of a grassland.  Middle Stone Age = Mwanganda's Village  Mwanganda's Village is one of the few Middle Stone Age archaeological sites in Malawi and it is found in Karonga. This site was first known for the findings of an elephant butchery site. At this site, archaeologists have found associated animal bones and stone artifacts. In Area 1 of the village, there was evidence of a single elephant carcass. The elephant bones were broken and dispersed into three main concentrations. These bones have been dated back to the late Middle or early Upper Pleistocene times. This evidence resulted in J. Desmond Clark's hypothesis about the site being a butchery site. Area 2 of the village contained evidence for other hunting activities, presumably on different occasions. Current research indicates that this site is not an elephant butchery site but evidence for successive colonization of riparian corridors by Middle Stone Age hunter-gatherers focused on exploiting localized resources during periods of humidity while other lakes dried up across Africa.  Later Stone Age  Rock art at the site of Mphunzi in the Chongoni Rock Art AreaThe earliest Later Stone Age occurrences in Malawi are dated between 17,000 and 10,000 BP. Most of the Later Stone Age sites in Malawi are rock shelters, which is a pattern throughout Africa as well. The last occurrence of the Later Stone Age dates to about the 18th-19th century AD.  Chongoni Rock Art Area  The Chongoni Rock Art Area is located in the Central Region of Malawi consisting of 127 sites and possibly more. These sites have art depictions of rock art and paintings from the Later Stone Age and Iron Age. = Central African rock art traditions = The current understanding of Central African rock art is using Benjamin Smith's division of the art by certain characteristics. His analysis led him to divide the rock art into four traditions based on the certain motifs and symbols used within the art itself. The two red traditions listed belonged to the hunter-gatherers that continued to use Later Stone Age technology, such as microlithic tools. They became known as the BaTwa, they continued to use the same technology into the Iron Age. The two white traditions belonged to the Chewa people. This is known because the white traditions cover an area almost identical to the extent of spread of the modern Chewa people as well as the symbols used in the paintings are still used in their rituals today.  The Red Animal tradition  This tradition comprises the depiction of animals and human figures always in red. Animals are usually outlined and filled completely and tend to naturalistic in style. There is usually stylization that does not allow the viewer to recognize the species of the animal.  The Red Geometric tradition  This tradition comprises the depiction of simple geometric forms. Common shapes consist of circles, concentric circles, divided circles, ladders, lines, and parallel lines. Red and white pigments were used for painting but, the white has disappeared from most of the sites because of its momentary nature.  The White Zoomorphic tradition  This tradition was executed by finger-painting. It comprises stylized animals and human figures. The paintings are usually done in white but, sometimes they were done in charcoal. This art belongs to the Chewa men, it depicts masked men and animals from the ceremonies performed by the Nyau association at rites of passage including Chinamwali and funerals.  The White Spread-eagled tradition  This tradition is for the art that contained a figure that resembles a stretched hide. These figures almost always had snake-like motifs and other geometric designs like circles and lines of dots. The primary color used is white but, black and red paintings are also present. These figures are the works of Chewa women and the art was produced during the CHinamwali ceremonies which are performed when a girl is coming of age. The symbolism represents water and fertility. This area is an UNESCO World Heritage Site because of the traditions of rock art and its continued link to the present society.  Mwana wa Chentcherere II  Mwana wa Chentcherere II rock shelter is one of the largest rock painting sites in Malawi, and was excavated by J. Desmond Clark in 1972. This site shows evidence as to how the hunter- gatherers persisted into the Iron Age. Many of the paintings were motifs for sexuality and fertility which shows a very intimate side of women that is not usually shown in the ancient times.  Iron Age  Archaeological research of Malawi's Iron Age began in the mid-1960s by Keith Robinson. From 1968 to 1975, Robinson excavated many areas around southern Malawi and established an Iron Age archaeological sequence for Malawi. Comparing the pottery, they determined a new intermediate phase of ceramics proving there was continuity from the Early Iron Age to the Late Iron Age. Later Stone Age hunter-gatherers first occupied the area.Seitsonen, Oula. \\"Lithics after Stone Age in East Africa: Wadh Lang'O Case Study.\\" (2004).  Cultures of the Iron Age  Nkope culture = Nkope is an Early Iron Age site located about 20 kilometers south of Monkey Bay and about 40 kilometers north of Mangochi. This site dates from about 250 to 1000 AD. The Nkope culture is defined mostly by its ceramics called Nkope ware. This pottery is usually thick for their size and has pronounced and decorated rims. The basic vessels are spherical pots with inverted rims and bowls with flattened and thickened rims. This pottery has a very wide distribution, being found in all of southern Malawi as well as parts of central and northern Malawi. It has also been found in areas of eastern Zambia and Mozambique. Most of the Nkope pottery sites are located along the shores of the southern tip of Lake Malawi and along the Shire River and its tributaries and the Namwera and Mulanje plateau areas. = Kapeni culture = The Kapeni culture is found on the banks of the Shire and dates to about 800 to 1100 AD. Kapeni ware is considered the earliest of the late Iron Age pottery since it closer related to the Nkope ware than other late Iron Age pottery. The Kapeni culture existed simultaneously with the Longwe culture and there has been evidence of it overlapping with the Nkope culture in some locations as well. = Longwe culture = The Longwe culture has been inadequately researched. Since Longwe pottery resembled Mawudzu pottery, it was originally classified as Mawudzu ware. When more of the same pottery was found, it was given its present name. Longwe culture dates to about 1000 AD and in some areas of the country, existing the same time as the Kapeni culture. This culture can be found north and east of the Mulanje Massif, in the lower Shire area, one the Ntaja-Namwera hills and the Shire highlands. At many of the sites, stone tools were found so it is believed that the people of the Longwe culture are hunter-gatherers, but they still produced ceramics. = Mawudzu culture = The Mawudzu culture is named after the Mawudzu Hill site in the lakeshore area and dates from 1200 to 1750 AD. This culture is also mainly defined by its ceramics. The Mawudzu pottery is very distinct and it is unlikely to have evolved from either the Kapeni or the Nkope wares. Radiocarbon dating places this pottery to the twelfth century AD, which was a time where Kapeni pottery was no longer in use and Longwe pottery was being phased out. It is thought that Chewa-speaking people may have introduced the Mawudzu pottery. Despite the lack of early Iron Age features on the pottery, the distribution patterns of Mawudzu sites is similar to that of the early Iron Age people. Later on, Mawudzu inhabitants spread to cover more parts of southern Malawi. In these southern sites, there is more evidence of dependence on cultivation and rearing of cattle. = Nkhudzi culture = Nkhudzi pottery was first recorded at Nkhudzi Bay and is distinct from the earlier types of pottery mentioned above. Its introduction into Malawi is said to be a result of long-distance trade in about eighteenth century AD. The distribution sites of Nkhudzi sites are similar to those of Mawudzu sites. Most sites are located in areas of fertile land and close to water sources. Archaeological evidence indicates that Nkhudzi settlements were very large. Farming, rearing of cattle and smelting of iron were the main economic activities of this culture.  Mankhamba  Mankhamba is a Late Iron Age settlement site in southern Malawi. Some of the artifacts recovered at the site include local and imported ceramics, lithics, iron and copper objects, beads, and faunal remains. = Ceramics = * Pottery- The local pottery has been identified as many Mawudzu and Nkhudzi pottery. The Mawudzu pottery consisted mostly of deep, hemispherical bowls and Nkhudzi pottery consisted of thistle-shaped pots and open bowls. There was also a few sherds that belonged to Early Iron Age communities. * Pipe- Eighty fragments resulting in a minimum of 68 smoking pipes were recovered at this site. This is the largest collection of smoking pipes were recovered at an Iron Age site in Malawi. * Spindle whorls- One complete and five fragmentary spindle whorls were recovered, all of them had evidence of use-related wear. = Stone artifacts = * Grinding stones * Utilized stones- Seven of the eight utilized stones were water-rolled pebbles, four were used for hammering, three were probably nkhulungo, smooth stones that women use to polish or smooth house floors after they add more dirt. The last stone had soot consistent with use as a firestone. = Iron objects = There was evidence for Iron-smelting at the site consisting of large amounts of iron slag and tuyere pipes. The open nature of the site exposed many of the artifacts to be severely corroded, making it difficult to identify many of the tools. The ones that have been identified consists of hoes, axes, spears, arrows, and razors. = Copper objects = This site also has the largest assemblage of copper objects ever recovered at an Iron Age site in Malawi. Copper objects were well preserved and are easily identifiable. The most common objects were needles, wires, fish hooks, rings, and rods which were obviously used for fishing. There was also ornaments that consisted of necklaces, rings, and bangles. = Faunal remains = At this site, there are remains of both domestic and wild animals, including fish and gastropods. The people targeted large and medium-sized bovids more than the small ones. The most common being impalas, buffalos and elephants. A majority of them had chop marks that are consistent with ivory-working. The domesticated animals included cattle, sheep/goats, pigs, dogs, chickens, and dove/pigeons. Over 30% of the bone specimens were burnt and had green coloration due to the contact of the copper objects.

The episode was written by Megan Mostyn- Brown and directed by Scott White. It was first broadcast on October 31, 2016. In the episode, Tetch manages to get an hallucinogen called \\"Red Queen\\" that causes damage on people. He pours the hallucinogen on Gordon, sending him on a hallucination trip with Barbara acting as his guide. Tetch is in fact retrieving Alice's blood to create a virus to give it to the founders in their dinner. Meanwhile, Cobblepot sets off to separate Isabella from Nygma, telling her his real nature. The episode received generally positive reviews, with critics praising Benjamin McKenzie's performance but criticizing the pace and Tetch's plan. CinemaBlend named Gordon's hallucinations as one of the best TV superhero moments on 2016. Plot Valerie (Jamie Chung) wakes up in the hospital, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) having been beside her all this time. Valerie deduces that Gordon told Tetch (Benedict Samuel) to kill Lee (Morena Baccarin) because he knew he would do the opposite. Gordon denies this but Valerie says that he loves Lee and as such, they break up. Gordon leaves, not sure if they left on good terms. Meanwhile, Tetch meets with a herbalist to find a potion and is given a potion named \\"Red Queen\\", a hallucinogen that caused many people to go into the \\"loony bin\\". After being given the Red Queen, Tetch pours the hallucinogen on the herbalist, causing him to experience hallucinations. Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) and Isabella (Chelsea Spack) continue to bond, making plans to dine at the mayor's office. Nygma realizes that he missed Cobblepot's (Robin Lord Taylor) dinner and departs, after kissing Isabella. Cobblepot has begun to assume that Nygma was kidnapped but is relieved when Nygma arrives. However, Nygma tells him that he is now in love with someone, leaving him shocked and heartbroken. Tetch and the Tweeds arrive at the morgue and retrieve Alice's (Naian Gonzalez Norvind) corpse. Barnes (Michael Chiklis) and Bullock (Donal Logue) arrive at the scene and Gordon is also there to help but is told by Barnes to leave. Gordon then asks Bullock for help. They also find that as Tetch had been near Alice, he is carrying the virus. Bruce (David Mazouz) prepares dinner for a date with Selina (Camren Bicondova). Cobblepot gets ready for a founders party but Nygma cannot go as he is having a date with Isabella. Barnes is told by Lucius (Chris Chalk) that the rats have been experiencing manic behavior and Tetch could contaminate everyone if he is not caught in time. Tetch has in fact been retrieving Alice's blood for a recipe. Mario (James Carpinello) is angry after having found out what happened in the dinner but Lee calms him down, although he wants Gordon out of their lives. Gordon talks with Lee, who is also deducing that he told to kill her as he knew he would do the opposite. Gordon continues to deny it, upsetting Lee. While visiting Valerie, Gordon spots Tetch and chases him. He finds him on the stairs but Tetch pours the Red Queen on him. Cobblepot finds the library where Isabella works and purposefully tells her that Nygma was in Arkham Asylum for murder. During the founders' party, Cobblepot runs into Tetch. Gordon's hallucination begins with him in an elevator with Barbara (Erin Richards) acting as his guide, deducing that he could face his inner demons. His first stop is in the GCPD where Bruce tells him that he does not have much time before disappearing. The scene shifts to Gordon and Cobblepot in a battlefield in the precinct. He finds Bruce, who shows him the damage Gordon has done: the deaths of many officers and civilians. Bruce then shoots Gordon and retrieves Martha Wayne's necklace before he falls. Barnes and Bullock interrogate an employee of the lab and Barnes uses his strength to make him reveal that he noticed Tetch with a van. Discovering the date, Barnes and Bullock find that Tetch plans to kidnap the founders. Tetch has already hypnotized everyone to drink the recipe with the virus. The next stop is on Gordon's dream life where he is married to Lee and they have two children, Frankie and Julie. When he begins to enjoy this dream, everyone disappears. In the founders' party, Cobblepot is talking with Kathryn (Leslie Hendrix), who threatens him and he demands to know who she is. The party is interrupted by Tetch, who forces the founders to drink from the potions. The GCPD arrives before they drink and Barnes brutally attacks Tetch, showing his symptoms and causing Tetch to have a breakdown as he has his sister's blood. Tetch and the Tweeds are arrested and sent to Arkham. In the hospital, nurses find Gordon's body and Mario rushes him to a room for help. Selina arrives late to the date but Bruce is still eager and they begin to dine a cake. The final stop reunites Gordon with his father, Peter (Michael Park), and they go into a car trip. Peter makes Gordon seem that he is just lost and that needs to find the answer to stop acting like a lone wolf. The hallucinations end as Mario manages to wake him up. Mario leaves but Gordon notices a band-aid in his neck. Isabella goes to Dahl Manor and tells Nygma that she loves him, regardless of his nature and they kiss. Cobblepot runs into them and leaves, heartbroken. Gordon finds his father's ring in his apartment which reads \\"While we breathe, we shall defend\\" in Latin. Barnes is in the GCPD, having finished his will when he is visited by Gordon. Gordon asks to be reinstated as detective and Barnes agrees. The final scene shows Kathryn meeting with a man, with both claiming that Cobblepot is still regarded as a criminal. The man is also revealed to have the same ring that Gordon found. Production=Development On October 2016, FOX announced that the seventh episode of the season will be titled \\"Red Queen\\" and was to be written by Megan Mostyn-Brown and directed by Scott White. The episode was promoted as the Halloween lineup of FOX, being with Lucifer the last shows to present the lineup. Casting Jessica Lucas, Drew Powell and Maggie Geha do not appear in the episode as their respective characters. In October 2016, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include Jamie Chung as Valerie Vale, Chelsea Spack as Isabella, James Carpinello as Mario Calvi, Leslie Hendrix as Kathryn, Naian Gonzalez Norvind as Alice Tetch and Michael Park as Peter Gordon. Reception=Viewers The episode was watched by 3.16 million viewers with a 1.0/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 10% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.48 million viewers with a 1.1/4 in the 18-49 demographics. With this rating, Gotham ranked second for FOX, behind Lucifer but beating Lucifer in 18-49 demographics, fourth on its timeslot and eight for the night behind Timeless, Scorpion, 2 Broke Girls, Man with a Plan, Kevin Can Wait, Dancing with the Stars, and The Voice. The episode ranked as the 62nd most watched show on the week. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode was watched by 5.21 million viewers and had an overall rating of 1.8 in the 18–49 demographic. Critical reviews \\"Mad City: Red Queen\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. The episode received a rating of 78% with an average score of 6.8 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.0 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gotham gave us a nice twist in the form of Gordon's dad possibly being an evil Owl boss, and figured out a way to get Gordon back on the job in an 'adequate' manner using hallucinations, but for the most part 'Red Queen' felt like middling nonsense designed to fill time bell-to-bell.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the series a star rating of 4 out of 5, writing \\"All in all, I'm still really enjoying this season of Gotham. While not without its problems, it embraces the wacky world it has created, and, though sometimes dark, is really gripping television.\\" Sage Young of EW gave the episode a \\"B\\" and stated: \\"It's the day after Jervis Tetch forced Jim Gordon to choose between the two women in his life, and both of them want to talk about what he said.

Its mode of action does not depend on direct killing or inhibition of the invading pathogen, but rather on increasing physical or chemical barrier of the host plant. Like the Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) a plant can develop defenses against an invader such as a pathogen or parasite if an infection takes place. In contrast to SAR which is triggered by accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins or salicylic acid, ISR instead relies on signal transduction pathways activated by jasmonate and ethylene.  Discovery  The induction of plant-induced resistance to pathogen protection was identified in 1901 and was described as the \\"system of acquired resistance.\\" Subsequently, several different terms have been used, namely, \\"acquired physiological immunity\\", \\"resistance displacement\\", \\"plant immune function\\" and \\"induced system resistance.\\" Many forms of stimulus have been found to induce the plant to the virus, bacteria and fungi and other disease resistance including Mechanical factors (dry ice damage, electromagnetic, ultraviolet, and low temperature and high temperature treatment, etc.) Chemical factors (heavy metal salts, water, salicylic acid) and Biological factors (fungi, bacteria, viruses, and their metabolites).  Mode of action  Induced resistance of plants has two major modes of action: the SAR pathway and the ISR pathway. SAR can elicit a rapid local reaction, or hypersensitive response, the pathogen is limited to a small area of the site of infection. As mentioned, salicylic acid is the mode of action for the SAR pathway. ISR enhances the defense systems of the plant by jasmonic acid (JA) mode of action. Both act on the effect of the NPR-1, but SAR utilizes PR genes. It is important to note that the two mediated responses have regulatory effects on one another. As SA goes up, it can inhibit the effect of JA. There is a balance to be maintained when activating both responses. ISR responses can be mediated by rhizobacteria which has shown to be effective against necrotrophic pathogens and insect herbivores that are sensitive to JA/ET defenses. The importance of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR has been widely reported. The biological factors of plant-induced system resistance generally include two broad categories, namely classical plant-induced resistance to disease induction (PGPR) or fungi that promote plant growth (PGPF), and plant growth- promoting rhizosphere bacteria (PGPR) or plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF). The difference is mainly due to the fact that the latter can effectively promote plant growth and increase crop yield while causing (or increasing) plant resistance to diseases (sometimes including pests).  Effects on insects  Some studies have also reported negative effects of beneficial microbes on plant-insect interactions as well.  Applied research  To date, work on induction of plant systemic resistance has shown that inducing plant system resistance work has important implications for basic and applied research. Induced resistance applications in melons, tobacco, bean, potato, and rice have achieved significant success. Over the past decade, the study of induced system resistance has become a very active field of research. Methods to artificially activate the ISR pathway is an active area of research. The research and application of inducing plant system resistance have been encouraging but are not yet a major factor in controlling plant pathogens. Incorporation into integrated pest management programs have shown some promising results. There is research regarding defense against leaf chewing insect pests, by the activation of jasmonic acid signalling triggered by root- associated microorganisms. Some ongoing research into ISR includes (1) how to systematically improve the selection of induction factors; (2) the injury of induced factors; (3) the phenomenon of multi-effect of induced factors; (4) the effects of chemical induction factors on environmental factors; (5) Establishment of population stability of multivariate biological inducible factor. Research into ISR is driven largely by a response to pesticide use including 1) Increasing resistance by pathogens to pesticides, 2) the necessity to remove some of the more toxic pesticides from the market, 3) health and environment problems caused as an effect of pesticide use, and 4) the inability of certain pesticides to control some pathogens.

Courtesy of Rocky Mountain National Park Upper Beaver Meadows is a montane meadow and visitor attraction in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. The area is known as a good bird-watching spot and its trail leads to a number of other trails within the park. The trails may be used for hiking, snowshoeing, or cross-country skiing. Montane ecosystem The meadows of Upper Beaver Meadows rest at the upper limits of the montane ecosystem. Forests of pine and Douglas fir trees only inhabit the slopes of this valley because the soils of the valley bottom are too moist from the high water table to support tree growth. This creates a broad meadow that is kept open by grazing wildlife. The park has fenced in an area where a former aspen grove was mowed down by grazing elk. The aspen grove protected inside the fence has grown dense by sprouting shoots from older trees roots. Upper Beaver Meadows is described by Scott Roederer as \\"a pretty little valley of meadows and aspen bordered by ponderosa and spruce / fir forests.\\" Beaver Brook runs through the meadow. Recreational activities Beaver Meadows map. Courtesy of Rocky Mountain National Park. Activities include hiking, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing on Upper Beaver Meadows trail.

History In 1889, the steamship Compania de Filipinas was built by Lobnitz in Renfrew, Scotland, and was acquired by the Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas the following year. In 1898, while serving as an inter-island steamship, the Revolutionary Navy (later the Philippine Navy) acquired her as their flagship. The Revolutionary Navy was initially composed of a small fleet of eight captured Spanish steam launches refitted with Gonzalez Hontoria de 9 cm (mod 1879) guns, and then received a donation of five merchant ships, namely the Taaleño, the Balayan, the Bulusan, the Taal and the Purísima Concepción, prior to having the Filipinas. The acquisition was made possible by the Filipino crew of the ship, who launched a mutiny under the Cuban Vicente Catalan. Catalan, in turn, proclaimed himself \\"admiral.\\" When the Filipino flag was hoisted by the ship, the East Asia Squadron contested it and claimed the ship for Germany. Despite an impending naval incident, the ship remained under Filipino control until the Philippine-American War proved the naval superiority of the American Asiatic Squadron and decimated the Revolutionary Navy. The vessel continued to be in the service of the Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas until 1942, when World War II opened in the Pacific theater. During the war, Compania de Filipinas was incorporated by the Japanese government to the nation's merchant marine as a cargo ship. She was renamed . On 3 July 1945, it was sunk by an aerial mine near Jindo Island. While this ship was the only Hoei Maru that was a cargo ship, there are other Japanese vessels with the same name: *Hoei Maru No. 2 (tanker), sunk by a naval mine on 10 September 1944 *Hoei Maru (minesweeper), sunk by torpedo on 29 September 1944 *Hoei Maru No. 3 (tanker), sunk by aircraft on 21 January 1945 *Hoei Maru No. 5 (tanker), sunk by aircraft on 6 May 1945 Technical details The tonnage of the Compania de Filipinas vary from 655 to 900 grt. It had one triple-expansion engine, a drive shaft, and a propeller. Her hull number is 342.

He is most notable for his indie professional wrestling games, such as Wrestling Revolution for iOS and Android devices, which received over 100,000 downloads two months after its launch in 2012. The game later went on to surpass 10 million downloads and its sequel, Wrestling Revolution 3D, went on to compete with WWE 2K games on the mobile and PC market. Dickie began his game development career in 2000 with his first PC game, going on to retire in 2009 to become an educator. He came out of retirement in late 2011 and transitioned to mobile game development, which led to the release of Wrestling Revolution in 2012. However, he once again retired from full-time game development in 2018. In 2019, Dickie confirmed that a new wrestling project was in development for the Nintendo Switch and mobile devices. Many of Dickie's games are infamous for their awkward controls and poor graphics. He has mentioned that the low resolution and low poly graphics in his games have allowed for better performance, in turn enabling him \\"to push a lot of boundaries\\". The indie and low budget nature of Dickie's games have often contributed to their popularity, leading to Dickie describing himself as being \\"single-handedly responsible for the worst games to ever be enjoyed by millions of people.\\"  Early life  Mat Dickie was born in Brigg, North Lincolnshire in 1981. His parents worked on a small newsstand, where he stayed while they worked, and boredom drove him to express his creativity by producing makeshift toys for himself with the materials available there. He attended Brigg Primary School. He became interested in developing games at an early age, often sketching out ideas for games. Some of his works were influenced by games he played as a child, including WWF No Mercy, Super Fire Pro Wrestling and WWF WrestleFest. Dickie also tinkered with Deluxe Paint on his Commodore Amiga until he acquired a PC in 1998, which signaled the beginning of his game development career.  Career = PC game development (2000–2008)  One day, Dickie was walking through a Woolworths when he stumbled across a copy of DIV Game Studio, a programming language that promised to make game development easy. He purchased it, and spent the summer of 2000 learning it from the examples. Dickie released his first game, Hardy Boyz Stunt Challenge, in August 2000. The game had the player play as one of the Hardy Boyz, who were wrestlers in the WWF (later renamed the WWE). The game took two weeks to complete and was posted on a wrestling website where it received 15,000 downloads and positive feedback, which inspired him to continue making video games and to make his own website in November 2000 to host his games. He moved to Manchester in 2001 to complete a Bachelor of Science in video games and computers at Salford University. In 2006, Idigicon, who had previously published one of Dickie's games, Boxer's Story, contacted him again to make a version of his newest release, Wrestling Encore, for the British professional wrestling promotion One Pro Wrestling; however, legal complications arose due to 1PW not having the video game license to the American professional wrestlers working for them. In order to counteract this issue, 1PW attempted to buy the rights to the whole game off of Dickie instead of the rights to sell the version he had created for the promotion at their live shows, with the added benefit of him getting to meet the wrestlers working for the promotion at the time, including Bret Hart and Jeff Jarrett. Dickie declined this offer. In 2007, Dickie created his first major non-wrestling game, Hard Time, a prison simulator which was named by Games for Windows Magazine as the \\"Indie Game of the Month\\". The game was almost released through a subsidiary of THQ. Dickie was also looking forward to develop his wrestling brand with them; however, they felt it was a conflict of interest. Dickie retired from developing video games in early 2009 after the release of The You Testament, a game based on biblical stories he developed in three months, with PC Gamer calling it the \\"best worst game ever.\\" Retiring from game development, he became a developer of educational applications, publishing educational resources on TES. Dickie had ambitions of enhancing learning and making learning fun; however, he later came to the conclusion that entertainment did not have much of a role to play in education. As of 2017, his educational resources have been used in 10,000 classrooms; he was also invited to the 2011 TES awards. He also became an author, writing a book on his game development career and writing others on religion and spirituality as a religious educator.  Mobile and console game development (2011 – Present)  In early 2012, Dickie was unemployed, about to buy his first home and awaiting the birth of his first child; this motivated him to come out of retirement and move to developing mobile games, releasing Wrestling Revolution as his first major mobile game. He also released several 2D remakes of his classic PC games on mobile, such as Popscene in 2014, Wrecked, and Hard Time in 2017. His most successful game to date, Wrestling Revolution 3D, reached 50 million downloads, becoming the first sports game on Google Play to do so. In July 2018, Dickie once again announced his retirement from full-time game development, citing \\"frightening intolerance\\" from digital retailers among other reasons. In an interview, he also cited increasing demands from players after the release of AAA titles such as WWE 2K19. Dickie stated he did not wish to compete directly with WWE games, but intended to provide a \\"cheaper... lighter... [and] more creative alternative that's always going to be made by one man or a smaller team.\\" In 2019, Dickie confirmed on his social media that he is working on a new wrestling project for mobile devices and the Nintendo Switch.

It was written by Michael Carrington and directed by Rich Correll. In the episode, Raven and Chelsea attempt to use magic to attend the Halloween party of Raven's nemesis, Alana. While the plan works, a mistake in their spell-casting causes them to start turning into cows. In the subplot, Cory tries to convince Victor that he's too old to be trick-or-treating with him. Plot Raven and Chelsea are the only students in their class not invited to Alana's Halloween party because of Raven's bad history with Alana. At the Chill Grill, Victor reveals that Alana's having the party at the restaurant, which Raven knows Alana did to spite her. Chelsea panics after realizing Victor accidentally switched their orders and she was eating a hamburger rather than a veggie burger, breaking her vegetarian commitments. After finishing his shift, Victor, dressed up as Victor Frankenstein, prepares to go trick-or-treating with Cory, who's wearing a body builder costume. Cory tells Victor that he wants to trick-or-treat with his friends rather than his father. The disappointed Victor allows Cory to go with his friend William, whose costume is a remote control that causes nearby electrical products to malfunction. Tanya, dressed as Igor, cheers Victor up by offering to trick-or- treat with him in Cory's place. In Raven's room, Chelsea begins wearing a pin button with a cow's face on it out of guilt for eating the burger. She and Raven pass the time by looking inside a trunk filled with paranormal objects that belong to Raven's grandmother. They come across a magical book that contains instructions for a spell that can grant any wish and decide to try casting it to get invited to Alana's party. After placing the necessary ingredients in a cauldron and reading the magic words out loud, they get a call from a hypnotized Alana confirming their invitations. The two then wish to become the most popular girls at the party and to win the costume contest. They fail to notice Chelsea's button fall into the cauldron during their second incantation and go upstairs to prepare their costumes. While looking for outfits, they begin to panic after noticing their ears resembled cow ears and they had white tails on their backsides. Eddie comes to the house and offers to take them to the party, but they force him to leave with the spell book as they start mooing sporadically. The two discover that they are turning into cows due to the button's interference with the spell and cannot reverse the process without the book. Raven suggests that they go to the party and get the book back to undo the spell, believing that the students won't question their appearances on Halloween. Cory and William return to the house empty- handed due to William's costume setting off multiple alarms in the neighborhood. Victor and Tanya arrive back with a bag full of candy and allow the boys to take some of theirs. Cory tells Victor that he misses trick-or- treating with his father and wants to do it with him next year, but Victor takes the two boys out to get some more candy. At the party, Raven and Chelsea struggle to find Eddie as they continue to develop cowlike bodies and mannerisms. When they finally locate Eddie, Chelsea eats the book page they needed to reverse the spell. Alana's friends halt the party to announce the winners of the costume contest. Alana is outraged to learn that she placed second behind Raven and Chelsea, who have completely transformed into Holstein cows and figure they \\"might as well milk it.\\" It is revealed that the whole night was all a vision that Raven had right before Chelsea ate the burger, allowing her to stop Chelsea from eating meat and prevent her vision from happening. Back at the house, Victor and Tanya spend their alone time eating their Halloween candy. Reception Even a decade after its release, \\"Don't Have a Cow\\" is considered a Halloween classic, with a number of publications praising the main plot revolving around Raven and Chelsea's cow transformations. MTV named it #1 in their \\"9 most iconic Disney Channel Halloween episodes\\" and called it one of the scariest Disney Channel Halloween experiences, stating \\"When the spin-off series debuts, I seriously hope they remake this episode, because what's more traumatizing than becoming a cow? NOTHING.\\" Glamour listed it in their \\"9 Disney Channel Halloween Episodes to Watch,\\" saying, \\"All you need to know about the Halloween episode of That's So Raven is that it ends with Raven and Chelsea turning into real-life cows. Like, they grow snouts, moo excessively, and chew cud. If that doesn't explain the high school experience, then what does?\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2003 American television episodes Category:That's So Raven Category:Halloween television episodes Category:Fictional cattle ","title":"Don't Have a Cow (That's So Raven)"},{"id":"52166773","text":"The Bluestars were a garage rock band from Auckland, New Zealand, who were active during the 1960s. They became one of the most popular bands in New Zealand at the time and enjoyed a hit in the Auckland area with their first single, which appeared on Decca Records, where they were the first New Zealand rock band to be signed to the label. But, they are now best known for their subsequent release, \\"Social End Product\\", that with its line \\"I don't stand for the Queen\\", took aim at the monarchy and social oppression, anticipating certain sentiments expressed in the music of the Sex Pistols and other 1970s punk acts. Their work is now highly regarded by garage rock enthusiasts. History=Origins The Bluestars formed in Auckland, New Zealand in 1962. John Harris, a young reporter for the Auckland Star, was also a musician adept on several instruments. One day he met Murray Savidan and Roger McClay, two students at Auckland Grammar School, at a second-hand music shop, and they decided to form a band, initially called the Nomads. Saividan sang and played bass and McClay played guitar. Harris became the drummer, but switched to lead guitar after McClay departed from the group. Jim Crowley became the group's drummer. Harris recruited a friend, Rick von Bokhoven to join on vocals and guitar. In 1962, the Nomads changed their name to the Bluestars. By 1963, they were playing regular gigs at church halls and youth clubs. That year, a key turning point in the band's early development happened when Savidan bought a copy of the Beatles' Please Please Me LP and played it for the group. They immediately decided to change their whole approach to a beat group format. They cancelled all of their scheduled appearances in order to learn the new material, rehearsing nearly all of the songs from Please Please Me. They returned to live performance and unveiled their new repertoire at St Chad's Hall, but were initially greeted with a tepid response. But, within a week of plying new material, it began to catch on. With their new direction, they immediately made most of the other local bands appear outmoded and their stock began to rise. Influenced by the Beatles, they began to write their own songs. In early 1964, they approached Eldred Stebbing of Zodiac Records about a possible record deal. They recorded several demo tapes at Stebbing's basement studio, but none of the recordings were issued. At this time bassist Murray Savidan was handling the group's bookings and arrangements. He steered them away from the seedy and sometimes dangerous inner-city clubs in favour of suburban dance venues, such as the Tamaki Yacht Club, where they often drew crowds of up to three hundred. RecordingDecca= In 1965, actor and voice-over man Terry Hayman approached the group, offering to become their manager. He told the group that he had a recording contract with Decca Records in London. While the group was skeptical of his claim, they signed with him anyway. Hayman arranged for a clandestine recording session at Auckland's Radio Theatre, where they snuck in, uninvited, and hurriedly recorded four tracks before the Auckland Symphony Orchestra arrived. Hayman brought in recording engineer Wahanui Wynard. Two of the songs from the session, much to the band's astonishment, ended up being released on a single for Decca, demonstrating that Hayman was, not only affiliated with the label, but had arranged to have the band signed in November, making them the first New Zealand rock band to record for the prestigious label. The resulting single \\"Please Be a Little Kind\\" b/w \\"I Can't Take it\\" was released by Decca's London label in December 1965 and on their Australian counterpart in February 1966. The A-side was a moody ballad, and, on the flip-side, \\"I Can't Take It\\" was a raucous and upbeat garage number. The single reached #12 on the Auckland charts. The Bluestarts became one of the most popular bands in New Zealand along with the La Di Da's and the Gremlins. Later in 1966, they went to Mascot Studios to record a follow-up \\"It's the End\\" and \\"S'pose We're Away\\", but the single was rejected by Decca, who parted ways with the group. The band recorded several other songs at the Mascot sessions, such as the brooding \\"Don't Wanna Be Lonely\\". =Allied International= They proceeded to sign with Allied International Records, and recorded their next single which featured a song on the A-side for which they are best-known, \\"Social End Product\\". The song features highly invective lyrics delivered in snide fashion by Murray Savidan. Its first line, \\"I Carry my girl through the main city streets\\", is based on a real-life incident involving a row between lead guitarist John Harris and his girlfriend in which he carried her \\"kicking and screaming\\" around downtown Auckland. Its defiant third line, \\"I don't stand for the Queen\\", announced a swipe at the conventional practice of standing to sing \\"God Save the Queen\\" before public events, such as movie showings, and anticipated the kind of anti-royalist sentiments later heard from the Sex Pistols and other punk acts. The B-side, in stark contrast to its counterpart, is a light pop ballad. The single failed to chart. Later in 1966, guitarist Rick von Bonhoven departed, and in an attempt to reflect the influence of popular organ-based acts such as the Spencer Davis Group and the Small Faces, drummer Rick Crowley moved to keyboards. The group brought in a new drummer, Eric Jackson, who was seventeen at the time. In October the Bluestars opened their own music club, the Gallows, in Remuera. They painted the walls in deep blue and adorned them group-themed images and artifacts. After, numerous attempts to secure a club license, they were unable to secure one, but opened anyway, functioning without a proper permit. In an effort to keep outside noise to a minimum, the group always made sure to keep the windows closed during performances, but other bands did not take this precaution, and a rash of neighbor complaints forced them to finally shut down by year's end. In January 1967 they did a summer tour of various coastal resorts. In February, they released their last single, the music hall-influenced \\"I'm a Little Man\\" b/w \\"Sherlock Sweet\\". The B-side had a garage organ-based riff similar to that in ? and the Mysterians' \\"96 Tears\\". Like their previous effort, the single failed to chart. In March 1967 they broke up. Later developments John Harris moved on to composing and recording religious songs with St Paul's Singers and later became a successful television producer. Murray Savidan became a successful advertising agent, as well as professional photographer. Rick von Bokhoven became a graphic artist. Jim Crowley moved to Sydney and continued to be active in music, playing with several bands over the years. He died in 2001. In the intervening years their work as come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts, and has appeared in various compilations such as Wild Things, volume 1, Trans World Punk, Volume 2\\", and Ugly Things, Volume 3. The song \\"Social End Product\\" is particularly well-regarded. Ian Marks mentioned \\"...the Bluestars got to record their own genuine 100% original, garage punk classic, possibly the greatest '60s punk record of them all – the mighty 'Social End Product'\\".

In 1972, Jozef T. Milik published a significant fragment of the Visions of Amram.Stone, Michael E. \\"Amram.\\" In Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls. : Oxford University Press, 2000. Since then, controversy has surrounded this document at every turn. In this testament, Amram gathers his sons, Moses and Aaron, to his deathbed and relates stories of his life, providing wisdom and commanding understanding.Wise, Michael, Martin Abegg Jr., and Edward Cook. The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation. New York: HarperSanFrancisco, 2005. This document is named for a vision shared during this time. This document has many distinguishing features that separate it from the other Dead Sea Scrolls found in the Qumran Caves. Primarily, copies of Visions of Amram are written in Aramaic, unlike the majority of the Qumran texts which were scripted in Hebrew. This unique feature, along with its suspected dating to the second century BCE, leads most scholars to believe these documents were written prior to and apart from the Qumran sectarian documents.Perrin, Andrew B. \\"Another look at dualism in 4QVISIONS of AMRAM.\\" Henoch 36, no. 1 (2014 2014): 106-117. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials, EBSCOhost Due to the multiple copies, organization and comprehension of this fragmented document is two-fold. 1) First, fragments are categorized into five groups based on manuscript, creating pieces of a whole, yet incomprehensible, document. 2) Secondly, fragments are overlapped and mixed to create a single, somewhat coherent, account. Unfortunately, this document is far from complete. Vast sections of this account have been put together through intensive reconstruction, leading to controversy and further uncertainties.  Manuscript Content  Upon the year of his death (136 years old), Amram, (son of Kohath, son of Levi) gave in marriage his 30-year-old daughter, Miriam, to his brother, Uzziel. The wedding was 7 days long. After the feast, Amram called for his children and began to recollect the story of his time in Egypt. Amram tells his son is Aaron to summon his son Malachijah and Amram tells him that he will give them wisdom. Amram and Kohath go to Canaan from Egypt to build tombs for those who perished during the Egyptian sojourn. Amram stayed in Canaan to finish the tombs while Kohath left for Egypt due to the threat of war. Amram was unable to go back to his wife and family in Egypt for 41 years until the war between Egypt, Canaan and Phillistia was over Next, Amram presents his vision. He accounts two divine figures fighting over fate of his judgement. Amram inquires about their claimed authority and challenges their rule in his life. In apparent unison, the figures declare their rule over humanity, and offer him a choice of destiny. One presents himself as Belial, Prince of Darkness, and Melkirisha, King of Evil, who is empowered over all Darkness.Eisenman, Robert, and Michael Wise. \\"Testament Of Amram.\\" Dead Sea Scrolls Undercovered. 375 Hudson Street: Penguin Books USA Inc., 1993. The other figure, dubbed Melchizedek, Prince of Light and King of Righteousness, rules over the Light. Amram tells his audience that he wrote down his vision as soon as he awoke. Amram also differentiates between light and darkness. He tells his audience the Sons of Light will be made light and Sons of Darkness will be made dark. Sons of Light are destined for light and joy while Sons of Darkness are destined for death and darkness. It fundamentally explains how light will triumph over darkness and it is declared that the Son of Darkness will be destroyed.  Type of Literature  The type of genre of the Visions of Amram is decided according to common features found in relation to other texts. However, according to Jorg Frey, there needs to be room for uniqueness and character.Berthelot, Katell, and Daniel Stokl Ben Ezra. Aramaic Qumranica. Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2010. Accessed November 1, 2016. It is essential to use different types of scholarly genres to categorize the texts, even though ancient authors did not use them or used them quite differently. This is a reason why there is ambiguity surrounding whether or not the Visions of Amram are classified as \\"testaments\\" or \\"visions\\". Jean Starcky was first to believe that the Visions fall under a testament because of the multiple similarities with the Testament of Levi.Tervanotko, Hannah. Denying Her Voice: The Figure of Miriam in Ancient Jewish Literature. Bristol, CT: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2016. Accessed November 1, 2016. Here scholars compared the introductory narrative of the Visions of Amram with the introductory sections of the Testaments of the 12 Patriarchs, most specifically the Testament of Levi.Drawnel, Henryk. \\"The Initial Narrative of the 'Visions of Amram' and its Literary Characteristics\\". Revue De Qumrân 24, no. 4 (96) (2010): 517-54. Officially, Milik was the first to call the Visions of Amram a testament. However, people began to question why the author called it the Visions of Amram and not the Testament of Amram. Here, differing views started to emerge and the world \\"testament\\" used to describe the Visions, slowly began to disappear. Furthermore, John J. Collins, pointed out how the introductory narratives does not have the usual format of a testament. Instead it has a summary heading. Collins would say that it is a vision of the demonic Melchiresha and its angel counterpart. Similarly, Henryk Drawnel would say that the genre of the visions seems to be didactic.Drawnel, Henryk. \\"The Literary Characteristics of the Visions of Levi\\". Journal for Ancient Judaism, 2010. Accessed November 1, 2016.  Dualism in Visions of Amram  Example of fragmented manuscripts found at the Qumran Caves (due to copyright, could not upload pictures of Visions of Amram) It is relatively certain that Visions of Amram originated well before the scribes of Qumran, and likely existed beyond this community. Nevertheless, based on the evidence of multiple copies found fragmented in cave 4, this text appears to have been significant to the people of Qumran.Duke, Robert R. The Social Location of the Visions of Amram (4Q543-547). New York: Peter Lang, 2010. Although never explicitly referenced in Qumran sectarian literature, Amram's vision reflects prominent themes, such as dualism, which were cornerstone to the Qumran beliefs. Dualism in the Qumran community is defined by the belief in a divine predetermined plan, which offers two ways of existence. On one end of the spectrum lies goodness and light and on the other, darkness and evil. These sides are in continuous combat, but in the end God will determine ultimate victory to the Sons of Light.Flint, Peter W. The Dead Sea Scrolls. Core Biblical Studies. Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2013. Terms used in Visions of Amram, such as Sons of Light and Sons of Darkness, are also reflected throughout Qumran Sectarian literature. The Vision of Amram depicts a scene of two divine figures who claim to rule all humanity. These figures are extensively reflected in significant Qumran literature, such as the Community Rule, where the theme of dualism is prominent. This extremely fragmentary piece of literature, given its early origins, could have had huge implications on the way dualism developed in Qumran. Unfortunately, due to its thoroughly incomplete nature, most of the insights on dualism gleaned from these documents only find their footing in speculation. For example, 4Q544 has been reconstructed to account a choice of fate offered to Amram, represented by these two figures. In the Qurman community, predeterminism was the common belief which would have led to incongruiencies with this text. It is difficult to draw an absolute conclusion on the specific brand of dualism depicted in the Visions of Amram due to its uncertain translation. Nevertheless, it is valuable in providing a more complete look on the traditions and literature that may have inspired and driven the beliefs of the Qumran community.

Her research has included fieldwork near Lake Turkana, northwestern Kenya, and her research often touches on the question of animal domestication and the origins and development of African pastoralism.  Biography  Gifford-Gonzalez attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she received her B.A., M.A., and her Ph.D. She has been the past President of both the Society for American Archaeology and the Society of Africanist Archaeologists, and has served on boards for the International Conference of Archaeozoology (ICAZ), the Society for American Archaeology (SAA), and the Archaeology Division of the American Anthropological Association. She was also on the Academic Advisory Council of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research and the Long-Range Planning Committee of the American Anthropological Association. In addition, she is on the editorial boards for the African Archaeological Review, Journal of African Archaeology, California Archaeology, and Teals d’Arqueologia. She retired from teaching at the University of California, Santa Cruz at the end of the academic year in 2015. She has also taught at the University of Nairobi, the University of Tromsø, la Universidad del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Academia Sinica, Beijing, China. In 2018, she release the textbook \\"An Introduction to Zooarchaeology\\".  Research  Gifford- Gonzalez's work at Lake Turkana on the border of Ethiopia and Kenya has put her at the forefront of scholars who study pastoralism in that area. She specializes in the study of the domestication of donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats, and the importance that these animals had on the peoples who lived, and continue to live, at Lake Turkana. Cattle found at Pastoral Neolithic sites near Lake Turkana came with herders from northern Africa after the Sahara started to dry out. Gifford-Gonzalez argues that there seems to be a lag in the spread of domesticated animals farther south in eastern Africa, which may have been due to threats of livestock diseases such as Bovine Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF), which is almost 100% lethal for cattle. Other livestock diseases affect humans as well, such as Rift Valley Fever (RVF), East Coast Fever (ECF), foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), and trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). It is impossible, though, to tell if coming into contact with cattle caused epidemics of unfamiliar diseases in early pastoralist societies. Gifford-Gonzalez has also studied early evidence for fishing around Lake Turkana. Fishing has typically been associated with anatomically modern humans, but evidence of fishing has been found at sites near Lake Rutanzige, Olduvai Gorge, and Lake Turkana that date from the late Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene, prior to the earliest known members of the genus Homo. Gifford- Gonzalez then asks if it may have been possible for early hominins to have fished, and to have passed that knowledge down to Homo sapiens. Gifford- Gonzalez and Kathlyn Stewart conducted ethnoarchaeological research with Dassanetch pastoralists who live in the lower Omo River Valley, and they found that the Dassanetch were relied entirely on their own livestock and on fish from the nearby river. Gifford-Gonzalez and Stewart were then able to study the material remains found at Dassanetch fishing camps, providing a useful point of reference for ancient archaeological finds from places such as Olduvai Gorge. She has also written about the use of genetic data in the study of animal domestication. Genetic data show that cattle from South Asia, Africa, and Europe are related. It used to be thought that Africa had no unique domesticates of is own but some evidence tentatively points to an independent domestication process of cattle in Africa. Genetic studies of cattle show that African and European taurine's lineage diverged somewhere in the 22nd–26th millennia BP. Analyses point to domestication of European stock around 5000 BP and African stock being around 9000 BP, even if the date of domestication is a point of controversy. The domestication process is sometimes glossed over as an invention by humans and not a process that is biological and evolutionary. But Diane Gifford-Gonzalez argues that animal domestication is an ongoing, dynamic system of interaction with animals that causes lasting changes to that animal.

By contrast, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says \\"From the early 1960s through the mid-1980s, the outlook for growth in the computer manufacturing industry was, for most of the period, unusually optimistic.\\" http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1986/09/art2full.pdf Models The four models of the 360/85 are: I85 (512K), J85 (1M), K85 (2M) and L85 (4M), configured with 2 2365 Processor Storage units, 4 2365 units, an IBM 2385 Processor Storage unit Model 1 (=2M), or an IBM 2385 Processor Storage unit Model 2 (=4M) respectively. The I85 includes two-way interleaved memory while the others provide four-way interleaving of memory access. Advanced/special features * The system console is L-shaped: one leg is the Main Control Panel, including a CRT, and the other leg includes 2 screens: \\"Microfiche Document Viewer\\" and \\"Indicator Viewer.\\" * Memory Cache - depending on the model and the situation, \\"the effective system storage cycle becomes one-third to one-fourth of the actual main storage cycle.\\" The memory cache is high-speed, static buffer memory situated between the CPU and main system memory (\\"Level 1\\" cache), available in 16 KB and 32 KB size options. The System/360 Model 85 is the first commercially available computer with cache memory. * Monolithic integrated cirtuits * Enhanced floating point - The Model 85 comes with extended-precision 128-bit quadruple-precision floating point * The Model 85 has both Read-only and Writeable Control Storage (it is the second System/360 to have writeable control storage; the IBM System/360 Model 25 is the first to have rewriteable control storage; the 360/85 was introduced Jan. 30, 1968). Emulation The 360/85, when equipped with the 709/7090/7094 Compatibility Feature, with the use of an emulator program permits running 709, 7040, 7044, 7094 and 7094 II programs. Gateway to the future In some respects, the System/360 Model 85 provided a glimpse into the future System/370 product line (particularly the 370 Model 165) - which IBM announced two years later (1970). It used the MST circuitry that was later used in the initial System/370 models, and introduced features such as 128-bit floating point arithmetic and block multiplexor channels that are also part of the System/370 architecture. The 360/85 uses microcode to control instruction execution, unlike the completely-hardwired 360/75 and 360/91; the high-end models of System/370 also use horizontal microcode, except the IBM System/370 model 195.

The Pan American League of Associations of Rheumatology (PANLAR), founded in 1943, gathers the scientific societies of rheumatology, health professionals related to rheumatic illnesses and rheumatic patient associations of all countries in the Americas. The mission of PANLAR is to stimulate, promote and support research, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of the rheumatic illnesses. The rheumatology field includes the rheumatic illnesses of the connective tissue, locomotive apparatus and musculoskeletical system. PANLAR is organized through four geographical areas:  North Zone  Canada, Mexico, United States  Central and Caribbean Zone  Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama  Bolivarian Zone  Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela  Southern Cone Zone  Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay The Association meets biennially and publishes a peer reviewed journal JCR, Journal of Clinical Rheumatology. It is a partner organisation of ILAR, International League of Associations of Rheumatology. First Steps In 1941, Dr. Aníbal Ruiz Moreno together with Dr. Fernando Herrera Ramos, submitted the idea of an ILAR regional league to Ralph Pemberton, then president of ILAR. In 1942, by request of Pemberton, the ARA accepted the proposal set forth by the South American doctors. A committee comprising doctors Russell Cecil, Robert Osgood, Ralph Boots, Loring Swain, Paul Holbrook and future Nobel Prize winner Philip Hench gave its final agreement and, soon afterward, with support from physicians in Canada, Chile, Brazil and Mexico, a path had been cleared to the creation of a society that grouped all rheumatologists in the continent. The committee suggested the creation of a provisional board to draw its charter, with Ruiz Moreno as president, Herrera Ramos as secretary, Richard Freyberg, from the U.S., as vice president and Wallace Graham, from Canada, as treasurer. On May 31, 1944, after two years of hard work by the committee, the Pan-American League for the Study and Control of Rheumatic Disease came into existence. A few days later, its name would be changed to the Pan-American League Against Rheumatism (PANLAR). A month later, Loring T. Swain, the first person to hold the position of secretary, announced its foundation to the medical community in the U.S. and abroad. In a letter addressed to the editor of JAMA, he wrote: “On June 15, I received a letter from Dr. Aníbal Ruiz Moreno of Buenos Aires, who has been chosen as the provisional director of the PANLAR committee, duly signaling that our Pan-American league is a reality.” PANLAR would become the first ILAR regional league. Its first president was Dr. Ralph Pemberton, who acted as such until his death in 1949. Dr. Ruiz Moreno followed suit between 1949 and 1953, while his friend Dr. Herrera Ramos headed the institution between 1955 and 1959. The first Pan-American Congress of Rheumatology was held in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in 1955 at the Copacabana, it featured an audience of 239 from 15 countries and provided an image of high quality and excellent organization. Since then PANLAR has hosted 20 Panamerican Congresses (see Panamerican Congresses). PANLAR Today PANLAR has experienced tremendous growth. It now operates in four regions with 21 member countries: North (Canada, USA and Mexico), Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Dominican Republic, Cuba), Bolivarian (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia), and Southern Cone (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay). Study groups were drafted during Antonio Reginato’s presidency in the first decade of the 21st century, and later the entity was organized as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit based in Atlanta (2014). The 2016–18 Executive Committee, headed by Dr. Carlo V. Caballero (Colombia), President-Elect Enrique Soriano (Argentina), Secretary General Carlos Lozada (U.S.) and Former President Carlos Pineda (Mexico), drafted a six-year (2016–22) development plan, approved by the Governing Board, the purpose of which is to stimulate excellence of rheumatology in the American continent and to advance the shared vision of becoming the main supplier of education and science, practice standards and rheumatology in Latin America. One pillar of this development plan is innovation.

Found in China and India, it causes a white rot in woody substrates. Taxonomy The fungus was first described from south India in 1993 as Pachykytospora thindii. In 2002, Yu-Cheng Dai and colleagues treated the genus Pachykytospora as a synonym of Haploporus, and he subsequently transferred this fungus to Haploporus. Description Fruit bodies of Haploporus thindii are crust-like, with a dimensions of up to long, wide, and 0.8 mm thick in the central part. The pore surface is coloured cream to pinkish-buff and has a corky texture. There is a distinct margin up to 5 mm wide that surrounds the crust. The angular pores number about three to four per millimetre. Haploporus thindii has a dimitic hyphal system (containing both generative and skeletal hyphae), and most of the generative hyphae feature clamp connections. The basidia are barrel shaped, with four sterigmata and a clamp at the base. The spores are ellipsoidal and thick-walled, measuring 20–37 by 6.5–9.1 μm. Habitat and distribution Haploporus thindii has been reported from South India, and in 2005 was reported in the Xizang Autonomous Region in southwestern China. The Chinese collections were found growing on the decomposing wood of honeysuckles (genus Lonicera) and maple (Acer). It has also been recorded in Taiwan.

Thomas live at the Newport Music Festival in 1960. James \\"Butch\\" Cage (born March 16, 1894 - 1975) and Willie B. Thomas (born May 25, 1912 - ?) were an American blues duo active from the 1940s to the early 1970s. Cage and Thomas were discovered in 1959 by musicologist Harry Oster, who promoted the two at the Newport Music Festival. Field recording with the duo conducted in the following year are praised for upholding pre- blues string band tradition. Cage's first instrument was a cane fife, though later on he became a credible guitarist and an even more accomplished fiddle player. As a result of the destruction caused by the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927, Cage settled in Zachary, Louisiana to work in a manufacturing factory and perform at social gatherings. Thomas was a factory janitor when he met Cage and previously worked as a waterboy. When he and his family moved to Zachary in 1925, Thomas was crushed by fallen furniture, causing a back injury which permanently disabled him and stunted his growth. Thomas accompanied Cage with vocals and the kazoo for years before learning to play guitar. Playing as a duo and in string bands at social gatherings and church services, the two were discovered by musicologist Harry Oster in 1959. Cage and Thomas engaged in a set of field recordings with Oster, making them a rare exception among the Baton Rouge area musicians of string band tradition who went largely unrecorded. Fourteen of the duo's cuts appear on the 1961 album Country Negro Jam Sessions, which also features tracks by Robert Pete Williams, a guitarist who occasionally performed with Cage and Thomas. Oster thought highly of Cage, describing him as \\"a great representative of the now virtually extinct nineteenth century negro fiddle tradition\\". In 1960, Cage and Thomas performed at the Newport Music Festival, while being positively received by an audience that for the most part never heard the duo's style of music. They continued to play together until Cage's death in Zachary, in 1975. Their recordings were also released on Raise a Ruckus Tonight and Old Time Black Southern String Band Music.

Brooks is an American paleoanthropologist and archaeologist whose work focuses on the Paleolithic, particularly the Middle Stone Age of Africa. She is one of the most prominent figures in the debate over where Homo sapiens evolved and when.  Biography  Brooks received her Ph.D. in Anthropology from Harvard University in 1979. She has been a professor at George Washington University since 1988 and is also a Research Associate in Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996, and in 2016 she was awarded the Medal of Honor (Médaille d'Honneur) of the City of Toulouse for contributions to African archaeology. Brooks has conducted extensive field research in the Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia, and in the Olorgesailie Basin, Southern Kenya Rift. Her work has also included projects in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Sweden, France, China, Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Brooks is also involved in the development and implication of new heritage policies in Africa.  Research  Brooks's research centers around human evolution and modern human behavior. Modern human behavior is generally thought of as beginning in Europe with the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, but Brooks and Sally McBrearty challenge this idea. They argue that thinking that modern human behavior evolved anywhere other than in Africa erases a fundamental part of African history from the archaeological record and also from the history of every human alive today. Brooks and McBrearty explain what it means to have modern human behavior, and they review the evidence found in Africa dating back to the Middle Stone Age. They argue that the evolution of humans was not a European revolution that suddenly overtook the world and replaced everything else, but rather a gradual shift from Africa and out. Their article in the Journal of Human Evolution (2000), \\"The Revolution That Wasn't: A New Interpretation of the Origin of Modern Human Behavior,\\" has been cited nearly 2000 times (as of December 2016), making it the most frequently cited article in that journal's history. Anatomically modern Homo sapiens were widespread by 50,000 years ago, though Neanderthals were still dominant in the colder climates of Europe, Asia, and Siberia until 35,000 years ago. This period from the Middle to Upper Paleolithic is a time marked with the emergence of new technologies such as specialized bone tools and blade cores, more prominent art, larger social networks, and more advanced economic strategies. Brooks has recently found evidence of tools being used in Africa long before they were being made in Europe, which lends support to the argument that modern human behavior arose in Africa. At the Upper Semliki Valley of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, she and her team have found evidence of complex technologies that date to the Middle Stone Age. They found barbed and un-barbed bone tools demonstrating that complex bone technology was in use by about 90,000 years ago in Africa, much earlier than in Europe. Another key point in the modern human behavior debate is the early fishing evidence that Brooks and colleagues found on the lakeshore of Ishango in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ishango has bone harpoon technology and evidence of fishing that dates back to 90,000 years ago. Fishing is considered to be part of the Upper Paleolithic/Later Stone Age and part of modern human behavior. The fishing industry in central, northern, and eastern Africa are all based on bone harpoons found at sites. Fishing rapidly spread throughout the continent as a result of the wetter conditions that developed in Africa at this time. Fishing technologies spread as far north as Naqada, Egypt, and as far west as Aouker massif, Mauritania. Brooks's work in the DRC shows that the people of Ishango and eastern Africa were able to develop fishing technologies before the end of the Pleistocene, long before they did in Europe.

The genus Hydnora is composed entirely of holoparasitic plants that attach to the root of their hosts and are restricted to Africa and southwestern Asia.  Description  Hydnora visseri, as a holoparasitic plant, lacks chlorophyll and depends entirely on its hosts, Euphorbia gregaria or E. gummifera, for all water and nutrition. H. visseri lacks leaves and roots. The vegetative body of the plant is a brown warty rhizome that spreads laterally through the soil. The bumps on the rhizome of Hydnora spp. can differentiate into haustoria (specialized organs for parasitizing the host plant), flower buds, or bifurcations of the rhizome. The rhizomes when broken are reddish to pink and contain high levels of tannins. The only portion of the plant that emerges from the soil surface is the large fleshy flower. The pollination of Visser's hydnora involves a trap and release mechanism where dermestid beetles are detained for several days, then released dusted with pollen. The fruit is a large berry with thousands of small (< 1mm diameter) seeds, and is usually buried or just at the soil surface.  Taxonomy  In South African and Namibia where Hydnora visseri may be encountered, four other Hydnora species exist, H. abyssincia, H. africana, H. longicollis and H. triceps. H. visseri can be discriminated from those taxa by its exclusive hosts Euphorbia gummifera and E. gregaria, and by having the longest tepals of any Hydnora spp. in Southern Africa, 5.5–9 cm long. The family Hydnoraceae has been submerged within the Aristolochiaceae in the Piperales, based on a modern phylogenetic study that also found that the plastome of H. visseri is highly reduced, relative to photosynthetic plants, with only 27K base pairs. Etymology * Genus name (generic epithet): Hydnora derives from the Ancient Greek , 'truffle', because of the somatic structure of this root parasite. * Species name (specific epithet): H. visseri is named after Stellenbosch University professor Johann H. Visser (1931-1990) and author of the text South African Parasitic Flowering Plants.  Distribution and habitat  Hydnora visseri grows in the winter rainfall and transitional rainfall areas of the Karas Region of Namibia and the Northern Cape province of South Africa. It occurs in a limited distribution centred around the Orange River, and is only present where its hosts Euphorbia gummifera and E. gregaria are present. H. visseri does not occur in the Karoo, nor a Karoo-type habitat, but is present in a region which the WWF has called the Succulent-Karoo and/or Nama-Karoo biomes. Hydnora visseri is most easily located by searching in around the base of the host Euphorbia plants.  Genomics  The highly reduced plastid genome map of Hydnora visseri. Hydnora visseri possesses one of the smallest plastid genomes among flowering plants. As compared to the chloroplast genome of its closest photosynthetic relatives, the plastome of Hydnora visseri shows extreme reduction in both size (27,233 bp) and gene content (24 genes appear to be functional).  Conservation  Based on the Red List of South African Plants, H. visseri is considered a taxon of 'least concern' due to its widespread distribution in regions with large protected areas, such as the ǀAi-ǀAis/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park and Tsau ǁKhaeb National Park.

Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, relations between the two countries have been strained over various geopolitical issues such as the interpretations of Islam, aspirations for leadership of the Islamic world, and relations with the United States, Europe and other Western countries. In addition, Iran has been severely critical of Bahrain for hosting the United States Fifth Fleet within the Persian Gulf at the Naval Support Activity Bahrain base. After the Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran were ransacked by Iranian protesters following the execution of Nimr al-Nimr, Bahrain followed Saudi Arabia's decision by severing diplomatic relations with Iran on January 4, 2016. On 16 April 2019, a court in Bahrain sentenced 139 people to prison for forming terrorist groups backed by Iran. A total of 169 were arrested.Bahrain Jails 169 For Founding 'Iran-Linked Terror Group' Relations under Pahlavi dynasty Iran had a historic claim to Bahrain until March 1970 when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi abandoned the claim as a result of secret Anglo-Iranian negotiations. Following this realignment of policy, the two countries signed a demarcation agreement in 1970. Relations under the Islamic republic Following the Iranian Revolution in which Ayatollah Khomeini came to power in Iran in 1979, Iran made clear its intention to export its Islamic revolution throughout the Muslim world, especially in the Arab world....bring about similar revolutions in the neighboring Muslim states... Ahmadiyya Muslim CommunityUnited States Department of State Two years later, Bahraini Shia fundamentalists orchestrated a coup attempt under the auspices of a front organisation, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The coup, which failed, would have installed a Shia cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjat al-Islam Hādī al-Mudarrisī, as the Supreme Leader of Bahrain with a theocratic government. The Bahraini government unofficially regarded the coup as Iran attempting to overthrow their Sunni government. Iran denied any involvement, saying the fundamentalists were inspired by the Iranian revolution but had received no support from Iran.Persian Gulf States Table of Contents U.S. Library of Congress Fearful of a recurrence, Bahrain cracked down on its Shia population, putting thousands into jail and further souring relations with Iran. In November 2007, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran made his first official visit to Bahrain and met with King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. Ahmadinejad discussed future agreements to supply Bahrain with natural gas during his meeting with the king and Bahraini officials. Iran and Bahrain are beginning to enjoy closer relations again and have engaged in many joint economic ventures. March 2011 protests in Bahrain In the aftermath of the March 2011 protests in Bahrain, Iran expressed strong support for the demonstrators, the majority of whom follow Shia Islam, which is Iran's state religion.Staff writer (16 March 2011). \\"Iran Condemns Bahraini Assault\\". Reuters (via The Irish Times). Relations between Tehran and Manama cooled considerably during the uprising, with both countries expelling one another's ambassadors.Staff writer (20 March 2011). \\"Iran Escalates Diplomatic Row with Bahrain\\". United Press International. Iran was joined by Iraq in opposing the Gulf Cooperation Council's military intervention in Bahrain. Allies of the Bahraini government, such as Saudi Arabia and other GCC member states, have conversely blamed Iran for inciting upheaval in the small archipelago country and questioned the legitimacy of the protesters' demands, echoing Manama's claims. On 12 August 2012, Foreign Minister of Bahrain Sheikh Khalid al- Khalifa announced from his Twitter account that Bahrain had reinstated its ambassador to Iran, nearly 18 months after relations between the two countries were strained following the 2011 Bahrain protests. On 19 July 2015, after Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei voiced support for the oppressed people across the Middle East, including Bahrain, the Iranian acting chargé d'affaires Morteza Sanubari was summoned by the Foreign Minister of Bahrain over \\"flagrant interference\\". The foreign minister handed \\"an official protest memorandum\\" to the diplomat over \\"statements made by Ali Khamenei against the Kingdom of Bahrain\\".https://news.yahoo.com/bahrain-summons-iran-diplomat-over-flagrant- interference-181650072.html On 13 August 2015, the Bahrain Interior Ministry announced arresting of five members of a terrorist group which was linked to at least one bombing attack in Sitra and was believed to accept aid and training from Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). On 1 October 2015 (a week after the 2015 Mina stampede), the Bahraini government recalled its ambassador from Tehran and ordered the Iranian acting chargé d'affaires to leave the country within 3 days in response to \\"continuing interference by Iran in the affairs of the kingdom\\". This comes after Bahraini authorities in Nuwaidrat (30 September) discovered a large bomb-making factory and seized a large stash of weapons and arrested a number of people suspected of having links with Iran's Revolutionary Guards.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/bahrain-recalls- ambassador-iran-meddling-151002032510372.html Bahrain's decision to recall its ambassador comes \\"in light of continued Iranian meddling in the affairs of the kingdom of Bahrain ... in order to create sectarian strife and to impose hegemony and control.Bahrain withdraws ambassador from Iran. The Daily Star.Bahrain withdraws ambassador from Tehran. Gulf News. In response (on 2 October), the Iranian Foreign Ministry retaliated by releasing this statement: \\"The number two official in Bahrain's embassy in Tehran is persona non grata and Mr. Bassam al-Dossari must leave Iran's territory within 72 hours,\\" the official IRNA news agency quoted a foreign ministry statement as saying late Friday.http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Oct-03/317517-iran- expels-bahrain-envoy-state-media.ashx Often, Bahrain alleges that Iran is responsible for the protests among its Shia population, according to Aljazeera. According to the guardian, sometimes the Bahraini government tells visitors from the U.S confidentially, that Iran backs some Shi’a oppositionists. Relations following 2016 attack on the Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran Saudi embassy in Tehran after the attack Following the 2016 attack on the Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran, the Foreign Minister of Bahrain \\"strongly condemned the two terrorist attacks on the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Tehran and its consulate in Mashhad in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\\" In a statement it said that \\"these demagogic and barbarian acts represent flagrant violation to the international convictions and norms, and the Vienna Convention which all safeguard the security and protection to the diplomatic missions.\\"http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/704348 On 4 January 2016, Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Iran, accusing it of interference in Saudi internal affairs after Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr for his involvement in 2011–12 Saudi Arabian protests. This was followed by the same decision of the Saudi government. On 9 January 2016, Bahrain's national airline Gulf Air announced that it would suspend flights between Bahrain International Airport and Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport on 14 January. Mohammad Khodakarami, the deputy for aviation and international affairs of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization (CAO), has been quoted in state media as saying that Gulf Air made the announcement through a letter to the Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization. Khodakarami said that the airline’s flights will remain suspended until further notice. However, in an attempt to tackle extremism, Iran desires to revive their relations with Bahrain alongside U.A.E and Saudi Arabia, by proposing a dialogue according to the Middle East monitor. 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification In the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, Bahrain was grouped together with Iran, thus attracted many Bahrainis to take interest in the encounter due to tensions between Bahrain and Iran. At the first match between Bahrain and Iran in Manama, tensions were seen with Bahrainis booed and whistled the anthem of Iran, and jeering of Iranian players. The match ended with a shock historic 1–0 win for Bahrain, the first time Bahrain beat Iran in 10 years. FIFA had fined Bahrain for the incident.https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/442049/FIFA-fines-Bahrain- after-fans-whistle-Iran-anthem Bahrain's peace treaty with Israel On September 11, 2020, Bahrain announced it would establish official tie with Israel. The surprising normalization attempt by Bahrain has prompted anger from the Iranian leadership, as many Iranian officials openly denounced the deal and accused Bahrain of working with Zionist groups. Revocation of Isa Qassim's citizenship Isa Qassim pictured in 2007 On 20 June 2016, Isa Qassim was stripped of his Bahraini citizenship. An interior ministry statement accused Sheikh Isa Qassim of using his position to \\"serve foreign interests\\" and promote \\"sectarianism and violence\\". Announcing the move to strip him of his Bahraini citizenship, the interior ministry said the cleric had \\"adopted theocracy and stressed the absolute allegiance to the clergy\\". It added that he had been in continuous contact with \\"organisations and parties that are enemies of the kingdom\\". Bahrain's citizenship law allows for the cabinet to revoke the citizenship of anyone who \\"causes harm to the interests of the kingdom or behaves in a way inimical with the duty of loyalty to it\\".  Iranian reactions  *The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, said in a speech carried by state media, \\"This is blatant foolishness and insanity. When he still could address the Bahraini people, Sheikh Isa Qassim would advise against radical and armed actions\\" and \\"Attacking Sheikh Isa Qassim means removing all obstacles blocking heroic Bahraini youths from attacking the regime\\". *Ali Larijani, Speaker of the Iranian parliament condemned the action, saying \\"this was an impolitic and quite an adventurous move by the Bahraini regime which assumed that by revoking the nationality of this prominent spiritual leader, it could lead the country’s domestic political crisis toward tranquility\\" and \\"the Al-Khalifa regime () must take a careful look at this historical record that clearly shows once a government starts threatening the influential figures of its nation with revocation of citizenship, it is taking its last breaths\\". *In a statement published by Fars News Agency, Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force said: \\"The Al Khalifa () [rulers of Bahrain] surely know their aggression against Sheikh Isa Qassim is a red line that crossing it would set Bahrain and the whole region on fire, and it would leave no choice for people but to resort to armed resistance. The Al Khalifa regime will definitely pay the price for that and their blood-thirsty regime will be toppled.\\" See also * Iran–Saudi Arabia relations * Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflict  References

Her methodological specialties are zooarchaeology and ethnoarchaeology. She has excavated Pastoral Neolithic sites in eastern Africa, focusing primarily on the domestication and herding of animals, particularly cattle and donkeys. She has also conducted ethnoarchaeological research on factors that affect body part representation in archaeological sites, and on foraging ways of life amongst Okiek people of the western Mau Escarpment, Kenya. She has also worked to conserve the Laetoli footprints.  Biography  Fiona Marshall received her PhD from the University of California-Berkeley in 1986. She is currently the James W. and Jean L. Davis Professor in Arts and Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. She is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Research  Fiona Marshall works on Pastoral Neolithic sites in eastern Africa. Food production started in southwest Asia about 10,000 years ago, leading to higher populations, cities, and social stratification. This early food production may have led to the current distribution of wealth. The Neolithic in Africa, however, went differently. Instead of people becoming sedentary farmers, many peoples in Africa became mobile herders. But this pastoralism did not spread throughout all of Africa; it was more sporadic around the Sahara. Africa did eventually develop food production in farming, it was just later than the rest of the world at around 4000 BP. Marshall has examined the question of why ancient peoples domesticated wild plants and animals. Cattle were the first domesticates in North Africa around 10,000-8000 BP. The reason that cattle were so useful is because they allow pastoralists to adapt to changing climates. Even though pastoralism took root in Africa, Marshall points out that herding also contributed to the unequal spread of food. Pastoralism is also more labor-intensive and unpredictable than hunting-and-gathering, which is why Marshall believes that it was more patchy throughout Africa rather than taking it all over at once. Along with food production, she analyzes the arrival of specialized pastoralism in East Africa. The specialization may have occurred because of the increased pastoral production opportunities in East Africa at that time. There are certain groups in East Africa that have been, and still are, very specialized pastoralists; groups like the Maasai, Samburu, and Rendille. These groups are basically fully reliant on their herded cattle, sheep, and goats with little to no hunting-and-gathering and fishing practices. Marshall's research at the site of Ngamuriak, Kenya, has shown that while early pastoralists in the Turkana Basin, Kenya, practiced a more generalized herding system, while specialized pastoralism developed farther south 2000 years ago. The steadying of the climate 3,000 years ago may have been one of the reasons that this specialization may have started to occur because the people could now rely on certain seasons to do certain things and could move their settlements accordingly. Another important factor may have been interaction between pastoralists and the hunter-gatherer groups around them. Marshall also looks at the difference between the archaeological remains left behind by pastoralists and hunter-gatherer groups. Identifying pastoralist sites is not always easy: pastoralists tend to not leave well- defined sites behind after they move on, and what they do leave behind does not always preserve well. In East Africa, the thing that tends to differentiate the two is the type of lithics that they create. Ceramics in this area are associated with both hunter-gatherers and pastoralists, although interaction between pastoralists and hunter-gatherer groups blurs these lines and makes it much harder for archaeologists to distinguish the two from each other. Marshall argues that the amount of dung that accumulates in corrals can also distinguish pastoralist and hunter-gatherer sites. However, dung is organic material which decomposes over time. Marshall suggests that when archaeologists select a site that might have been a pastoralist site, that they choose a site that is away from the water sources because some things, like phosphate minerals, will be better preserved. Another thing she does is look at animal bones from Neolithic sites to see what the people at those sites were eating. Looking at the bones that are represented at a site can help the archaeologist determine whether the site is a butchery site or a habitation site. Marshall looked at the bones that were discovered at Ngamuriak, Kenya, which were almost all from the domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats. Marshall found that the cattle long bones were typically broken. Her theory, supported by observation of fracture patterns, is that these bones were broken in order to get the bone grease inside.  Influence on others  Marshall has been very influential with archaeologists who study pastoralism in Africa. Her article from 2002 with Elisabeth Hildebrand, \\"Cattle Before Crops: The Beginnings of Food Production in Africa,\\" has been cited 279 times (as of December 2016). Albano Beja-Pereira et al. also use her paper in their article \\"The Origin of European Cattle: Evidence From Modern and Ancient DNA\\" from 2006. They acknowledge that cattle may have been domesticated from Africa first, and they use Marshall's research to help figure out where the cattle seen in the European archaeological record came from. Her 1990 article \\"The Origin of Specialized Pastoral Production in East Africa\\" has been cited more than 100 times (as of December 2016). This paper has been used by the same archaeologists that would have looked at the one mentioned above. This paper has been cited by Diane Gifford-Gonzalez in her paper \\"Animal Disease Challenges to the Emergence of Pastoralism in Sub-Saharan Africa\\". Gifford- Gonzalez uses Marshall's work about where specialized pastoralism began to help her make her argument about how being so close to animals may have affected their health. The specialization of pastoralism would have opened up the people to new diseases that they otherwise would not have been exposed to before.

The niacin test detects niacin (nicotinic acid) in aqueous extracts of a culture. M. tuberculosis strains that test negative for the niacin test are very rare. Redox reactions happening in Mycobacterium species produce niacin as a part of energy metabolism. Even though all mycobacteria produce niacin, M. tuberculosis accumulates an excess of niacin because of its inability to process niacin, excreting the excess niacin into the culture media, thus allowing it to be detected using the niacin test. The niacin test is typically only conducted on slow-growing, granular, tan colored colonies, as these are the morphology characteristics of M. tuberculosis on an agar plate. Because of its affordability compared to expensive identification methods like pyrosequencing or MALDI-TOF MS that require expensive machines and reagents. A negative niacin test on the left, a positive niacin test on the right.  Biochemical processes = Biochemical pathway  The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) degradation pathway in M. tuberculosis has a blockade that the scavenging pathway resulting in an excess of niacin that cannot be processed by the organism. Because of this abundance, the M. tuberculosis along with Mycobacterium canetti and varied types of Mycobacterium africanum release the excess niacin into their outside environment, in this case, the agar plate or another medium. Niacin is water-soluble, so the culture media can be tested for the presence of niacin to determine whether a Mycobacterium isolate is one of the three mentioned species. Those three species are members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.  Test strip process  The niacin test strip is typically composed of potassium thiocyanate, chloramine-T, citric acid, and 4-Aminosalicylic acid. In the presence of citric acid, chloramine-T and potassium thiocyanate will react to form cyanogen chloride. This chemical will break apart the pyridine ring of niacin to produce y-carboxy glutaconic aldehyde and joins an aromatic amine to form a yellow color. Mycobacterium smegmatis (negative for the niacin test)  Testing procedure  A niacin test strip is similar in appearance to a pH test strip. It is small, thin, rectangular, and white in color. Water is placed onto the culture plate and touched with a test strip for 15–20 minutes inside a small, sterile tube. If excess amounts of niacin are detected, the liquid inside the tube will turn yellow, a positive test. If the liquid in the tube is clear, there are no excess amounts of niacin and the test is negative. A positive niacin test does not necessarily indicate the presence of M. tuberculosis because other Mycobacterium species can test positive for excess niacin. Along with each batch of specimens being tested, a positive control of M. tuberculosis and a negative control with no organism will be included. If the positive control tests negative, there was probably an error with the batch, and likewise for a negative test showing positive. Because lab samples that are determined to be acid-fast bacilli are possibly M. tuberculosis, a biosafety level 3 organism, all niacin tests must be conducted in a biosafety cabinet with a full gown, respirator, gloves, and sealed laboratory to ensure the safety of the lab technologist performing the test. All tests must also be conducted with sterile technique.

Rhodes was born April 5, 1916 in Clinton, Missouri. She achieved a bachelor’s degree (1938) and a master’s degree (1939) in Geology at the University of Missouri. In 1942, Rhodes started her professional career in the production department at the Standard Oil Company of Texas (SOTEX), where she examined well samples, constructed sample logs, and prepared subservience maps and cross-sections. Later she transferred to the exploration department in 1946, she continued to work in this department for the rest of her career. Her duties in this department mainly included travelling the world to collect soil samples and collect to find oil reserves. Throughout her professional career, Rhodes became well known as a carbonate stratigrapher and an expert on several of the Permian basin rock units. Rhodes died on June 26, 1987 from cancer in Midland, Texas.  Biography  Rhodes was born on April 5, 1916 in Clinton, Missouri but grew up in Humansville. As Rhodes was pursuing a journalism degree, she had to take a science course as part of her degree's requirements. To satisfy this, she took a geology course, from here her interest in geology grew. She changed her major to geology after being inspired by Raymond E. Peck, who was a dedicated professor to her. After Rhodes changed her major to geology, she was taught by other well-known professors such as Edwin B Branson and Maurice G. Mehl. After graduation from the University of Missouri, Mary was active in the Jefferson Club, and she participated in several meetings of the University of Missouri Geology Department board for several years. With this job Mary examined well samples and constructed sample logs, prepared subsurface maps and cross sections, and recommended well locations to production management. Rhodes transferred into the department of Exploration Geology in February 1946, and spent the rest of her career working on various exploration assignments. Her outside interests included traveling throughout the world. Through dedicated work and interest, Mary became a distinguished carbonate stratigrapher and was considered to be an expert on several of the Permian basin rock units. She was also known to have taught hundreds of earth scientists who worked in the petroleum industry. Rhodes and co-worker John Emery Adams shared an interest in Permian basin and were coauthors of two papers, Starved Pennsylvanian Midland Basin and Dolomitization by Seepage Refluxion. Rhodes was also awarded honorary life memberships in the Permian Basin Section of Society for Sedimentary Geology in 1974 and to the West Texas Geological Society in 1978. Rhodes retired in December 1977, and moved back from Denver to Midland. She died from cancer 26 June 1987 in Midland, Texas.  Education  Rhodes graduated from Humansville High School in Missouri and after her high school graduation, Rhodes enrolled in the University of Missouri to undertake a degree in journalism. She achieved a bachelor's degree with distinction in 1938 and a master's degree in 1939 at the University of Missouri. While she studied at the University of Missouri she also acted as a teaching assistant for geology courses while pursuing her own education.  Career  The Standard Oil Company of Texas (SOTEX) was the company that gave Rhodes the opportunity to begin her geological career in Houston Texas in April 1942. This would also become the company that would lead her to move to Midland Texas where she would eventually retire. Her official role would have been \\"production department staff\\". Mary Louise Rhodes began her career as a petroleum geologist by testing and analyzing well samples, constructing sample geologic logs, and producing \\"subsurface maps and cross-sections\\". Meaning, at her job the Standard Oil Company of Texas (SOTEX) she was essential for the production of oil, and her department in general. After working in the production department for 6 years, she transferred to the exploration department, in February 1946 Rhodes transferred into the exploration department of the Chevron Corporation. During this time Rhodes had completed many exploration assignments including ones in Abilene, San Angelo, Amarillo, Corpus Christi, Texas and Denver. Mary was well practised and respected in the industry as a carbonate stratigrapher, as well as in the field of Permian basin rock units. The experience and knowledge gained first-hand working with Chevron Corporation allowed Rhodes to help educate hundreds in the field. While at Standard Oil Company of Texas, Mary would find others captivated with interests similar to hers. Mary and her colleague, John Emery Adams, with the aid of others had produced papers on the Permian Basin. These papers garnered attention in her field of study, as well as influenced studies at other institutions. These papers were the “Starved Pennsylvanian Mid Land Basin,” (APPG Bulletin, Volume 35, p. 2600-2607) and “Dolomitization by Seepage Reflfauxion,” (APPG Bulletin, Volume 44, p. 1912-1920). Mary Louise Rhodes also published on the work she did. It is recognizable that she currently has 7 publications that she co-wrote or was referenced on within the AAPG Bulletin; a well known and credible source in the world of geology.http://archives.datapages.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/data/browse/aapg- bulletin/search.html?sp.yearTo=&sp.sortBy;=relevance&sp.yearFrom;=&sp.sortOrder;=desc&sp.fullDoc;=mary+louise+rhodes&searchpage;=%2Fbrowse%2Faapg- bulletin%2Findex.html&y;=0&x;=0&sp.pageRequested;=1 An examples of one of the papers she was referenced in is Wellman Field, Terry County, Texashttp://archives.datapages.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/data/bulletns/1953-56/data/pg/0037/0003/0500/0509.htm?q=%2BtextStrip%3Amary+textStrip%3Alouise+textStrip%3Arhodes and Exploratory Drilling in 1950 which she assisted in.http://archives.datapages.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/data/bulletns/1949-52/data/pg/0035/0006/1100/1123.htm?q=%2BtextStrip%3Amary+textStrip%3Alouise+textStrip%3Arhodes Personal life Rhodes was a noted traveler during her time-off, a passion she shared with her two sisters, Ann R. Bradshar of Fort Collins and Doris E. Munroe, who lived with Mary until her death. Rhodes never married, and she did not have any children. She studied and was a Teacher Advisor (TA) at the University of Missouri, where she received her bachelor's and master's degree in Geology.  Awards  Throughout Mary's career she was an active member in Geology societies on both local and national levels. Her work and her contributions to the geology field were acknowledged and resulted in her being awarded an Honorary Life Membership in the Permian Basin Section of SEPM in 1974 . Just four years later, Mary received equal recognition but this time from the West Texas Geological Society.

The universal chord theorem guarantees the existence of chords of length 1/n for functions satisfying certain conditions. In mathematical analysis, the universal chord theorem states that if a function f is continuous on [a,b] and satisfies f(a) = f(b) , then for every natural number n, there exists some x \\\\in [a,b] such that f(x) = f\\\\left(x + \\\\frac{b-a}{n}\\\\right) .Rosenbaum, J. T. (May, 1971) The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 78, No. 5, pp. 509–513 History The theorem was published by Paul Lévy in 1934 as a generalization of Rolle's Theorem.Paul Levy, \\"Sur une Généralisation du Théorème de Rolle\\", C. R. Acad. Sci., Paris, 198 (1934) 424–425. Statement of the theorem Let H(f) = { h \\\\in [0, 1] : f(x) = f(x+h) \\\\text{ for some } x } denote the chord set of the function f. If f is a continuous function and h \\\\in H(f) , then \\\\frac h n \\\\in H(f) for all natural numbers n. Case of n = 2 The case when n = 2 can be considered an application of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem to the real line. It says that if f(x) is continuous on some interval I = [a,b] with the condition that f(a) = f(b) , then there exists some x \\\\in [a,b] such that f\\\\left(x + \\\\frac{b-a}{2}\\\\right) .

Proof of n = 2 Consider the function g:\\\\left[a, \\\\dfrac{b+a}{2}\\\\right]\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} defined by g(x) = f\\\\left(x+\\\\dfrac{b-a}{2}\\\\right) - f(x). Being the sum of two continuous functions, g is continuous, g(a) + g(\\\\dfrac{b+a}{2}) = f(b) - f(a) = 0. It follows that g(a)\\\\cdot g(\\\\dfrac{b+a}{2})\\\\le 0 and by applying the intermediate value theorem, there exists c\\\\in \\\\left[a, \\\\dfrac{b+a}{2}\\\\right] such that g(c) = 0, so that f(c) = f\\\\left(c + \\\\dfrac{b-a}{2}\\\\right). Which concludes the proof of the theorem for n = 2 Proof of general case The proof of the theorem in the general case is very similar to the proof for n = 2 Let n be a non negative integer, and consider the function g:\\\\left[a, b - \\\\dfrac{b-a}{n}\\\\right]\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} defined by g(x) = f\\\\left(x + \\\\dfrac{b-a}{n}\\\\right) - f(x). Being the sum of two continuous functions, g is continuous. Furthermore, \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}g\\\\left(a+k\\\\cdot\\\\dfrac{b-a}{n}\\\\right) = 0. It follows that there exists integers i,j such that g\\\\left(a+i\\\\cdot\\\\dfrac{b-a}{n}\\\\right)\\\\le 0\\\\le g\\\\left(a+j\\\\cdot\\\\dfrac{b-a}{n}\\\\right) The intermediate value theorems gives us c such that g(c)=0 and the theorem follows.

Abouchdid became a well-regarded specialist in infertility, and her patient base included Middle Eastern royal families. She advocated for family planning at a time when the promotion of contraception in Lebanon was punishable by a jail sentence. Early life Born in Brazil, Abouchdid grew up in Lebanon and decided at age 15 that she wanted to become a physician. At the time, Lebanese women were expected to simply choose good husbands rather than pursuing higher education. In 1924, the American University of Beirut (AUB) announced that it would be open to admitting women into its medical school. Abouchdid was able to meet the criteria for medical school admission in 1926, but she had to pass herself off as two years older than her actual age. Abouchdid's admission to medical school was contingent upon the school's ability to recruit a second female student. The dean did not want Abouchdid to enter medical school as the lone female in a class of 70 students. Abouchdid's acceptance to the school almost fell through when her female classmate, who was coming from the U.S., decided to get married rather than attending medical school. However, AUB's dean ultimately allowed Abouchdid to enroll anyway. Abouchdid graduated from AUB's medical school in 1931; for several years, she was the school's only female medical student or graduate. Career Abouchdid wanted to be an obstetrician-gynecologist, but she was sensitive to the impact that her gender might have on her credibility in the specialty. There were few women in medicine in the Middle East, and she thought that by working in obstetrics, she would be mistaken for a midwife. She decided to first become a pediatrician, where she could establish a reputation for herself as a competent physician before entering obstetrics and gynecology. She trained in pediatrics and obstetrics in Paris and London before working for several years at the Royal Medical College in Baghdad. In 1945, Abouchdid began a three-year stint of postgraduate training in the U.S., gaining experience at Johns Hopkins University, Duke University and Columbia University. During her time in the U.S., she was exposed to advances in reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and that became a particular focus for the rest of her work in medicine. Returning to Lebanon, Abouchdid established an infertility clinic, joined the AUB faculty and started an association for Lebanese female physicians. She became an expert in the treatment of infertility, treating both men and women and serving some of the royal families in the Middle East. By the 1950s, Abouchdid was involved in medicine on a worldwide level, having been named the Lebanese national secretary to the International Fertility Association. She visited the U.S. again in 1958 as a guest of Robert Hardy Andrews and his wife, and she spoke in support of the U.S. military presence in the Middle East to facilitate Lebanese independence. Remaining focused on her medical career, Abouchdid did not marry. Later life Abouchdid founded the Family Planning Association of Lebanon and served as its first president. By 1970, the association was working to change opinions and legislation related to contraception in Lebanon, but the group carefully limited its activities because the promotion, possession or sale of contraception was associated with a six-month to twelve-month prison sentence. For her contributions to medicine, Abouchdid was honored with a chivalry medal from the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, a distinction that had been previously reserved for men. She retired in 1985 and died of heart problems seven years later.

He was heavily decorated for valor, and is one of the iconic fighting men of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. He is most famous for commanding the 38th Infantry Regiment during the Second Battle of the Marne, and earning himself and the regiment the moniker, \\"Rock of the Marne\\" (later adopted by the entire 3rd Infantry Division). Early life Ulysses Grant McAlexander was born on 30 August 1864 in Dundas, Minnesota during the American Civil War. He was named after General Ulysses S. Grant, the commander of the Union Army. His father was Commodore Perry McAlexander (named after Commodore Matthew C. Perry) and his mother was Margaret (Tilton) McAlexander. Ulysses was the fifth child of the family, and his elder siblings are: Mary Diana (1850-1941), Sarah Ellen (1852-1922), Alice Grace (1857-1880), and Emily (1861-1914). He also had a younger brother, Monroe (1868-1950). His youngest brother, Albert W.(b. 1875) did not live past his first year. Ulysses' father died in 1879 in McPherson, Kansas, and his mother died there in 1880. Growing up in Minnesota and Kansas, Ulysses excelled in academia and physical activities, and was accepted into the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, sponsored by Judge John D Milliken of McPherson, Kansas. He began his freshman (plebe) year there in 1883 as a Cadet. Military career Ulysses G. McAlexander graduated West Point at the head of his class and commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of infantry in 1887. He was posted to Fort Meade, Dakota Territory, and Forts Custer and Missoula, Montana for service in the American Indian Wars. He served on the frontier without seeing combat until 1891, when he became the Professor of Military Science and Tactics at Iowa Wesleyan College. This was the first time Lieutenant McAlexander would train Cadets, and this experience helped him later in his career. In 1898, when the Spanish–American War broke out, he joined the US Volunteers so he could serve overseas. Receiving a commission as Assistant Quartermaster of Volunteers, with the rank of Captain, McAlexander entered the 28th US Volunteer Infantry Regiment and sailed for Cuba. During the Siege of Santiago, Capt. McAlexander received the Silver Star for \\"gallantry in action in the Santiago de Cuba Campaign, 22 June to 17 July 1898.\\" After returning to the United States, the young captain was soon placed in charge of the 13th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment sailing for the Philippines to combat the Philippine Insurrection. This unit was a veteran unit and had taken part in the Battle of Manila and the Battle of Malolos, and had experienced tough fighting in northern Luzon. Ulysses took over in 1900 and served in counter-insurgency operations until 1902. He and the regiment returned to the Philippines and fought from 1905–1906 until they were sent back to America. Until 1907, he served in Washington, D. C. as a member of US Army Headquarters general staff. In 1907, Capt. McAlexander was sent to become the Professor of Military Science and Tactics at Oregon State College where he was admired by Cadets and the community of Corvallis, Oregon alike. He oversaw the training of the Oregon State University Army ROTC battalion along with the construction of the armory, which was completed in 1911 (in 1971, the armory was renamed the \\"McAlexander Fieldhouse\\"). Upon his promotion to Major in 1911, Ulysses G. McAlexander was sent to be an active duty trainer and inspector for the Oregon Army National Guard. He served in this position until 1915, when he was again transferred to command the Oregon State Army ROTC battalion. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in July 1916. World War I When the United States entered the First World War in April 1917, LTC McAlexander was promoted to Colonel in May and sent to France to command the 18th Infantry RegimentDavis Jr., Henry Blaine (1998). Generals in Khaki. Pentland Press, Inc. p. 248. . OCLC 40298151 of the 1st Infantry Division. He commanded that regiment during their early tenure in France when it was being trained in tactics by the French Army. However, he was relieved of command shortly after. It is said that Col. McAlexander was relieved from his command position by General R. Bullard for profanely refusing to believe that the French could teach him anything about war. He was sent, instead, to serve with the Inspector General's staff. Col. McAlexander's talents as a commander would soon be put to good use, however, and he was assigned to command the newly arrived 38th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division in May 1918. After the regiment was trained in trench warfare and modern tactics, it was moved into the line to help bolster the French positions. The French commander, General Jean de Montdésir, wanted to piecemeal the Americans among his troops, but Col. McAlexander would have none of it, and the 38th wasn't budged until the 3rd Division was given a front of its own, in June, near Chateau-Thierry. In July, the Germans launched an assault against the Allied line, known as the Second Battle of the Marne. A three-hour artillery pounding of the 3rd Division's position announced the beginning of the offensive. In the dark of night, boats ferried the first waves of troops from the German Seventh Army. In short order, French and American defenses closest to the southern flanks of the river crumbled and were overrun. The swarming enemy was so well established on the 3rd Division's right flank that its position should have been untenable. And exactly here stood McAlexander's 38th, beset from both sides. Apparently, McAlexander had expected just these developments. Without yielding his hold on the Marne embankment, McAlexander refused both flanks so that his regimental front stood like a horseshoe, one battalion forward, one on either side. Try as they would, the Germans could not move this rock in their midst. McAlexander's 38th held out, and maintained their position. Because of their steadfastness, McAlexander and his 38th Infantry Regiment became known from then on as the Rock of the Marne. The German offensive was halted by 18 July 1918. For his decisive action, Col. McAlexander received the Army Distinguished Service Medal. On 22 July, the 38th Infantry Regiment launched an assault on Jaulgonne to prize it from the enemy. In the words of Capt. Jesse W. Woolridge, he enjoyed his finest five minutes of the war believing he was the spear of the assault, when he bumped into Col. McAlexander, crawling forward at the very front of his regiment. Col. McAlexander received the Distinguished Service Cross for this action, when he \\"displayed exceptional gallantry when his regiment, attacking without support on either flank, was stopped by severe machine-gun and artillery fire, by going ahead of the most advanced elements of his command, and in full view of the enemy, leading his men by force of his own example to the successful assault of Jaulgonne and the adjoining heights. Later in the day, when progress was again checked, he personally reconnoitered to within 50 yards of hostile machine-gun nests, and through information thus obtained, was enabled to hold an advanced position, with both flanks exposed, for more than 36 hours.\\" Receiving a promotion to Brigadier General, Ulysses G. McAlexander was sent to command the newly arrived 180th Infantry Brigade of the 90th Infantry Division, the \\"Alamo Division. The 180th Brigade, the \\"Texas Brigade,\\" consisted the 359th Infantry Regiment, the 360th Infantry Regiment, and the 343rd Machine-gun battalion. Most of the soldiers came from Texas, and were new to combat. McAlexander led them into their first battle at Saint-Mihiel on 12 September 1918, and quickly accomplished his objectives. Jumping off again in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, McAlexander's Texans took the fight to the enemy and attributed their success to their leader. After the war, the Texas veterans commissioned a portrait of General McAlexander (currently on display in Austin, Texas) that evokes their admiration of their commander. When the Great War ended on 11 November 1918, Brig. Gen. McAlexander stayed with the Allied occupation force in Germany until 1919, when he returned home. Post-War When Ulysses Grant McAlexander returned to his family in 1919, he served in the Army a while longer until retiring with the rank of Major General in 1924. He moved to Newport, Oregon that same year. Before he retired, he was commandant at Fort Douglas, just east of Salt Lake City, Utah. He was key in helping public relations with the Fort's civilian neighbors as he had a joint partnership in building the Fort Douglas Country Club in 1923. https://www.deseretnews.com/article/577312/Douglas-Country-Club-BIDDING-FOND- FAREWELL.htmlHe helped with the construction of the Memorial Union on the Oregon State campus, and in 1930, Oregon State College bestowed upon him an honorary doctorate.

In his last three seasons, they amassed a 37–3 win-loss record; his overall record at Hebert was 76–7–2. In 1982 he was appointed the first head football coach at the integrated West Brook High School created out of the merger of Hebert with the also almost all-white Forest Park High School. In their first season, despite an unpromising start, the West Brook Bruins won the state 5A championship. Durley died of lung cancer in Beaumont in 1984, at the age of 47. Alex Durley Stadium at West Brook was named for him. In 1988 he was inducted into the Texas High School Coaches Association Hall of Honor.

The mosque was tentatively built in 1680 and is the earliest known square single- domed Mughal style mosque in Bengal. Architecture The mosque has a square dimension with internal measurement of 3.81 meter*3.81 meter. It has four octagonal corner towers (minarets). The towers have kalasa vases at their base, are divided into sections by raised bands at regular intervals and are crowned by a kiosk and parapet. The mosque can be entered through three doorways each in the center of each wall except for the west sided wall(Qibla side). The west sided wall has three semi-octagonal arched mihrabs. The walls of the mosque are thick and that keeps the interior cool in summer. The square prayer hall is roofed over with the single dome. The dome is carried on squinch or octagonal drum. The dome seems to have a Persian architectural influence. The dome was previously crowned with a lotus and kalasa finial. There was a stone inscription on top of the east-sided entrance of the mosque. It is told that the inscription was taken away by the king of Bhawal in last century. Renovation and changes The lotus on the top of the dome was removed during a renovation. Also, the three mihrabs on the west-sided wall were constructed. In recent times, the mosque was extended in east, north and south side with tin sheds without breaking the original structures. As a result, the whole structure cannot be seen from outside now but the top of the mosque can be seen. The inner and outside of the mosque was painted newly during renovation.

President Rouhani met with Prime Minister of Thailand Prayut Chan-o-cha and discussed economic cooperation between the two countries. Economic relations Iran is looking into the Thai rice standard in order to start importing the product as soon as possible, while Thailand targets to export at least 700,000 tonnes of rice to Iran every year. In return, Thailand will start receiving imported crude oil and natural gas from Iran and wants to invest in energy businesses, which includes alternative energy projects. According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Thailand), trade between Iran and Thailand estimates around $794.46 million. The relationship will also cover food and energy security, with two-way trade set to reach 3 billion USD for the next 5 years, according to the Thai News Agency.

Olivelli graduated in law in Pavia in 1938 and went on to comment in papers on the legal and social issues of the time before he became a volunteer fighter in the Spanish Civil War and in World War II with a notable campaign fought in Russia. The war soured his views towards the Italian fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and his time in the resistance was marked with articles in a newspaper he founded dedicated to promoting the Christian message and attempting to improve upon aspects of fascism with a more Christian message. Olivelli's beatification cause started in 1988 under Pope John Paul II and he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause was first designed to demonstrate that Olivelli died because of hatred of his faith – thus beatification would be quicker – but disagreements led to a prolonged cause designed instead to prove Olivelli led a life of heroic virtue which Pope Francis confirmed on 14 December 2015. This confirmation allowed for the pope to name him as Venerable. Francis approved his beatification on 16 June 2017 and he was beatified on 3 February 2018 in Vigevano. Life Teresio Olivelli was born in 1916 in Como to Domenico Olivelli and Clelia Invernizzi. His maternal uncle was the priest Rocco Invernizzi – parish priest of Tremezzo – who served as Olivelli's spiritual and moral point of reference. He moved with his parents in 1926 to Pavia and was good at Latin when he studied there. He studied at Mortara and at Vigevano before transferring his studies to Pavia in 1934 where he graduated in law with honors in 1938 from the Ghislieri College. Each week he went to confession and to receive the Eucharist in the parish of San Lorenzo. It was around this time that he was a member of Catholic Action as well as the F.U.C.I. and a Fascist student group. In 1939 he became the assistant of administrative law at the University of Turin and won a competition in Trieste for oratorical skills, with a thesis on human dignities for all irrespective of race. He also penned articles on the social and legal issues of the times in the college paper \\"Book and Musket\\" and in the journal \\"Fascist Civilization\\". While in Turin he aided the poor and orphaned. He also learned to speak fluent German. In 1936 he volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War and then moved for educational reasons to Berlin from 1939 to 1941. In 1941 he volunteered to go to Russia to fight in World War II where he contracted frostbite due to the severe cold weather. Olivelli did not want to swear allegiance to the new Italian Social Republic in 1943 and was thus deported to Innsbruck in Austria on 9 September 1943 until he managed to flee and settle in Milan in the evening of 20–21 October. He started to become critical of the Italian regime and believed he could improve it through a more Christian message though later broke from it after seeing the situation with deporting Jewish people as per racial laws and the French invasion. Olivelli became part of the Italian resistance movement in Milan as part of the triangular resistance including Brescia and Cremona branches. He remained in touch with resistance members such as Peppino Pelosi and Fr. Carlo Manziana while he was in Brescia. Olivelli worked hard to create the newspaper \\"Il ribelle\\" and the first issue published on 5 March 1944 was dedicated to Astolfo Lunardi and Ermanno Margheriti who were both executed not long before. His paper was the underground newspaper for the Green Flames Brigades partisan group. Carlo Bianchi and Claudio Sartori helped him establish the paper in February 1944. Olivelli's codename at this time was \\"Agostino Gracchi\\". The partisan was apprehended in Milan on 27 April 1944 and was at once taken to the prison of San Vitore where he was tortured and beaten before being moved to Fossoli on 8 June. On 11 July his name was added to a list of 70 inmates to be shot but fled and hid in a field until he was recaptured. He was then transferred to Bolzano (August 1944) before being sent to Flossenbürg (September 1944) and then to Hersbruck. He shared food rations with inmates and treated their injuries and even spent time with Blessed Odoardo Focherini to comfort him before the latter died. Olivelli died from injuries he sustained in 1945 not long after defending a Ukrainian inmate from being attacked. He was kicked in the stomach and intestines plus being struck 25 times. His remains were cremated at the camp's crematorium. Beatification process The beatification process opened in the Diocese of Vigevano in a diocesan process that Bishop Mario Rossi inaugurated on 29 March 1987 and that Bishop Giovanni Locatelli closed in a solemn Mass on 16 September 1989. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope John Paul II on 19 January 1988 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" and titled him as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later validated the process on 27 March 1992 and received the Positio dossier in 2011. Historians – in a unanimous decision – voted in favor of the cause on 24 May 2011 while the theologians issued their approval – a majority verdict – on 2 December 2014 (after an inconclusive 17 December 2013 session) before the C.C.S. met to approve the cause (unanimous) on 1 December 2015. The confirmation of his life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Francis to name Olivelli as Venerable. But officials of the cause remained adamant that Olivelli was killed in hatred of his faith and therefore sought to establish another Positio that would lead to beatification without the required miracle needed for cases of heroic virtue. The Positio was submitted to the C.C.S. in 2016 at which stage theologians made a unanimous decision based on those new findings on 7 March 2017. The C.C.S. later met on 6 June 2017 and approved this and the cause shall now be passed to the pope for his approval. It has been reported that the beatification will take place in Vigevano on 13 January 2018 once the pope approves the cause. The pope approved his beatification on 16 June 2017 and he shall be beatified on 3 February 2018 after a new date for the beatification was coordinated. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the celebration on the pope's behalf; there were several bishops in attendance including the Archbishop of Milan Mario Enrico Delpini. The first postulator for the cause was Fr. Innocenzo Venchi (1986–2004) and then Fr. Abdul Rahman (2004–2011). The current postulator is Sr. Tiziana Adriana Conterbia (2011–present). The first relator for the cause was Fr. Cristoforo Bove from 3 April 1992 until his death on 4 October 2010 at which point Fr. Vincenzo Criscuolo was made the relator a month later on 12 November 2010.

It is used mainly for compiling models for Half-Life, Blockland, The Sims 2, The Sims 3, Rock Raiders, and other sandbox video games.[citation needed] It is also used to create models for a large number of indie games, Milkshape 3D's repertoire of export capabilities has been extended considerably, due to the efforts of both its creator and the community around it, and it is now able to be used for most games today, so long as an exporter for the required format is available.  History  MilkShape 3D was created by chUmbaLum sOft, a small software company in Zurich, Switzerland, which was established in the autumn of 1996. chUmbaLum sOft develops 3D tools for games and other applications. MilkShape 3D was originally created as a low poly modelling program by Mete Ciragan for the GoldSrc engine. Over time many features were added as were many export formats. Though not as advanced as other leading 3D modelling programs, it remains effective[citation needed] for the user because it is simple and cost-effective.  Features  MilkShape 3D has all basic operations like select, move, rotate, scale, extrude, turn edge, subdivide, among many others. MilkShape 3D also allows low-level editing with the vertex and face tool. Standard and extended primitives such as spheres, boxes, and cylinders are available. Milkshape 3D can export to over 70 file formats. MilkShape 3D is a skeletal animator. As well as supporting its own file-format, Milkshape 3D is able to export to morph target animation like the ones in the Quake model formats or to export to skeletal animations like Half- Life, Genesis3D, Unreal, etc. The number of file types that the program can support features all major 3D game engines, including Source, Unreal, id Tech and LithTech. It has become known as a useful converter from one format to another.  Controversy  Versions of MilkShape 3D prior to 1.8.1 Beta 1 allegedly contained code which caused itself to shutdown if it detected certain other programs running on the computer, such as Registry Monitor. Versions older than 1.6.5 (April 2003)MilkShape 3D Release Notes would go so far as to shut down the offending program and prevent it from being run again while MilkShape 3D was still running. This behavior was removed shortly after it had been discovered. Ostensibly, this was to prevent users from figuring out how to edit the Windows registry to commit software cracking and use MilkShape 3D without paying for it. However, there was no End User License Agreement until version 1.8.1, which authorized the program to do this. Some users have therefore accused MilkShape 3D of being spyware have boycotted it as a result. Milkshape does what it wants, with no EULA These issues have been resolved since version 1.8.1 Beta 2 (May 2007).

The coup put an abrupt end to the prosperity of the Ōuchi clan, though they would rule western Japan in name for another six years under the figurehead Ōuchi Yoshinaga, who was not related to the Ōuchi by blood.  Background  The Ōuchi clan was one of the most powerful and important families in Japan during the reign of the Ashikaga shogunate in the 12th to 16th centuries. Expanding out from Suō Province towards the western end of Honshu, the Ōuchi domains at their height comprised six provinces. They were among the primary families involved in foreign trade and relations, particularly with China. Under the patronage of the 31st family head Ōuchi Yoshitaka, the Ōuchi home city Yamaguchi prospered greatly from the cultivation of the arts and foreign trade, attracting famed artists, Chinese merchants, and Jesuit missionaries (such as Francis Xavier) to his city. At the same time, Yoshitaka fostered a close relationship with Emperor Go-Nara in Kyoto, and sponsored many imperial rites that the imperial court could not have afforded otherwise. On March 27, 1551, the embattled emperor appointed Ōuchi Yoshitaka as Acting Governor of Yamashiro (山城権守), the home province where the imperial capital Kyoto was located, in a bid to leverage the Ōuchi against the ravages of the warlord Miyoshi Nagayoshi, who occupied the capital. Yoshitaka, as Acting Governor of Yamashiro and, by extension, the protector of the court, embarked on a daring plan to relocate the emperor and the court to Yamaguchi. High-ranking courtiers and performers of imperial rites moved to Yamaguchi, including dignitaries such as former regent (kampaku) Nijō Tadafusa and retired Grand Minister (Sadaijin) Sanjō Kin'yori (三条公頼; father-in-law of Takeda Shingen). By the end of the eighth month of 1551, nearly the whole court, save for the emperor himself and the palace ladies, was in Yamaguchi. The military establishment of the Ōuchi opposed Yoshitaka's plan to settle the imperial court in Yamaguchi: such a move would see privileges accorded to the courtiers and undermine the military's standing in the Ōuchi clan. In addition, the plan was prohibitively expensive. This faction, represented by Sue Takafusa, also felt that Yoshitaka had become \\"weak\\" due to his complete obsession with the arts to the detriment of military matters after the failed siege of Toda Castle in 1543 against the Amago clan. Sue Takafusa, one of Yoshitaka's deputy shugodai, also took personal offence at the rise of the calligrapher Sagara Taketō, who benefitted from Yoshitaka's inward turn toward literary and courtly pursuits. Takafusa's dissatisfaction was such that another of Yoshitaka's shugodai Sugi Shigenori (杉重矩) warned that Takafusa had started conspiring against Yoshitaka by extension. However, Yoshitaka dismissed the threat, which caused Shigenori to lose confidence in Yoshitaka's judgement and to throw his lot in with Takafusa. Yoshitaka apparently placed his faith in his ally Mōri Motonari to come to his rescue in case trouble came from within; he did not know that Takafusa had already gotten Motonari's tacit approval for his coup. At the eve of his rebellion, Takafusa not only gained the support of fellow Ōuchi shugodai Sugi Shigenori and Naitō Okimori (内藤興盛), but also that of the Ōuchi's rival daimyō Ōtomo Sōrin in Kyushu. He was also supported financially by the merchants of Sakai, who were incensed at Yoshitaka's tolerance and patronage of the Murakami pirates collecting tolls on the Seto Inland Sea traffic lanes.  Coup  On 28 September, the rebel forces were assembled and started to march on Yamaguchi. Yoshitaka remained convinced that Sugi and Naitō would remain loyal, such that when the combined forces of Sue, Sugi and Naitō reached Yamaguchi, Yoshitaka could not mount an effective defence and had to flee the city, which the rebels set on fire. Yoshitaka and his close retainers assembled up to 2,000 men at the temple Hōsen-ji (法泉寺) in Ube, where they intended to make the mountain temple a stronghold in which they could fortify themselves; however, this plan evaporated in the night as the defenders deserted or defected to the enemy. Five thousand rebel troops surrounded Hōsen-ji the next day. The former regent Nijō Tadafusa went down the mountain to negotiate with the rebels, where he suggested Yoshitaka could be forced to retire in favour of his heir, but the rebels would not agree to this. Yoshitaka and his entourage of courtiers and close retainers abandoned Hōsen-ji and made their way to the northern coast of Nagato Province, where they hoped to escape to Iwami Province by boat. However, unfavourable winds pushed them back, and the entourage had to return to shore and seek refuge at the temple Tainei-ji (大寧寺) in Nagato. By this time, only 20 men remained with Yoshitaka. Seeing no way out of their predicament, Yoshitaka composed his death poem and committed seppuku on September 30. The rest of his entourage, including his prepubescent sons, his close retainers, and courtiers from the imperial court, soon perished, either following Yoshitaka in suicide or killed by the rebel forces.  Aftermath  After the coup, Takafusa invited the younger brother of Ōtomo Sōrin, Haruhide, as the new head of the Ōuchi clan since this was promised to the Ōtomo in order to gain their support. Ōtomo Haruhide hence became known as Ōuchi Yoshinaga, but Sue Takafusa (known as Sue Harukata after the coup) remained the one pulling the strings behind the scenes. This arrangement alienated his co-conspirators, since they agreed only that Yoshitaka be overthrown in favour of his son. Now that both were dead, Sue Harukata placed the blame on Sugi Shigenori and put him to death. Apprehensive of further purges by Harukata, Naitō Okimori went into retirement and died in 1554. Mōri Motonari bided his time until 1554, when he declared that the emperor ordered him to punish those who killed Yoshitaka, and rebelled against the nominal Ōuchi government. Sue Harukata was driven to suicide by his defeat at the hands of Motonari in the Battle of Itsukushima in 1555, and in 1557 Ōuchi Yoshinaga followed. The Mōri came to possess the Ōuchi lands in western Honshu hereafter. The city of Yamaguchi was burned during the coup, and looting and violence ran rampant for days after the coup had ended. The Jesuit Juan Fernández, who was at the scene of the chaos in Yamaguchi with Cosme de Torres, described the ensuing violence as \\"so destructive and deadly that the town was on fire and overflowed with blood for the space of eight days; for with the laws in abeyance, victorious wickedness raged everywhere with impunity, murder and plunder in all directions\\". The missionaries, despite being harassed during the chaos, escaped harm thanks to the protection given to them by the wife of Naitō Okimori, who was friendly to the Christians. Much was lost when the Ōuchi manor was sacked, including the family archives, countless artifacts, and documents of court rites brought from Kyoto by the courtiers anticipating the move of the capital. (Even the cranes in the Ōuchi household garden were butchered.) Despite efforts at rebuilding, the city was burned again in 1557 and 1569 in the warfare between the Mōri and the Ōuchi claimants, such that in a space of thirty years after the coup, \\"no sign of its earlier prosperity remained\\". The downfall of the Ōuchi had far-reaching consequence beyond western Honshu. The once-peaceful Ōuchi territories in northern Kyushu descended into warfare among the Ōtomo, the Shimazu, and the Ryūzōji, who struggled to fill the void. The Ōtomo came to control much of these former Ōuchi domains in northern Kyushu, and their city of Funai flourished as a new centre of trade after the fall of Yamaguchi. At sea, foreign trade with China also suffered. The Ōuchi had been the official handlers of the Japan-China trade, but the Ming Chinese refused to acknowledge the usurpers and cut off all official trade between the two countries. Clandestine trade and piracy replaced the official trade of the Ōuchi, as the Ōtomo, the Sagara, and the Shimazu vied with each other to send ships to China. In the end, it was the Portuguese traders, with their near exclusive access to the Chinese market, who became the most successful intermediaries of the Japan-China trade for the rest of the 16th century.

He is the eighth Governor- General of the Philippines from the Real Audiencia of Manila. Early life and career Doctor José Torralba was born of Jose Torralba and Melchora de Rios in Granada, Province of Granada, Spain on 3 April 1653. Prior to being governor, he served as senior auditor (oidor) of the Real Audiencia of Manila, who put him in charge of military affairs. One of the cases given to him was the residencia of Juan Antonio Pimentel, Governor of Marianas (1709-1720). On 22 March 1710, four ships headed by Capts. Woodes Rogers and Edward Cooke landed in Umatac, Guam. The English were treated well by Governor Pimentel, and were able to be refreshed with food and other supplies, despite Joseph de Quiroga's (Sergeant major of Marianas) efforts to set up a war council in case the English did raze the island. Pimentel did not meet with the war council. In addition, the governor gave the English gifts. Beyond the knowledge of Pimentel, the English were privateers and one of their ships, the Batchelor, was actually the captured Manila galleon Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño. Pimentel explained to Martín de Ursúa, Governor-General of the Philippines, that the Marianas cannot be defended due to lack of resources and personnel. Torralba, who arrived in Guam in 1711 for the investigation, was not convinced of this explanation, especially since there was a state of war between Spain and England at the time. The bonds Pimentel gained were forfeited, and he was deprived of his position as governor. Torralba sent him to Manila in chains. The verdict was handed down on 23 January 1712, and the Real Audiencia approved the decision on 24 July 1714. He was also charged with the residencia of the officers of the galleon Nuestra Señora del Rosario y San Vicente Ferrer, which was shipwrecked in 1709 at San Bernardino Strait. However, since the treasure carried made it to land, the charges were dropped. On 4 February 1715, Governor Ursúa died in Manila. Torralba succeeded him as Governor-General of the Philippines. Administration of the Philippines Moro raids continued during the Torralba administration, but the colonial government would take action after his term. In 1704, the Tournon affair stripped Torralba's predecessor as senior auditor, José Antonio Pavon, of his position. This sentence was reversed by royal decree on 15 April 1713. However, the decree arrived only during Torralba's administration. Due to various reasons, Torralba did not approve Pavon's reinstatement. Pavon sought refuge in an Augustinian convent. He had also forwarded proceedings against Gregorio Manuel de Villa (also an auditor), and two officers, namely Santos Perez Tagle and Luis Antonio de Tagle. Nevertheless, a royal decree on 18 August 1718 rendered Torralba's acts on these people null. With the arrival of the new governor, Fernando Manuel de Bustillo Bustamante y Rueda, they were reinstated to their respective positions. In addition, Pimentel was restored to his position of governor and was allowed to return to Marianas. Upon assuming office on 9 August 1717, Bustamante discovered financial mismanagement during the Torralba administration. The investigation was tasked to Andres Fernandez de Arquiju and Esteban Hizguiño. Within six months, the government was able to recover 293,444 pesos for the treasury, which includes the situado worth 74,482 pesos. Meanwhile, the investigation showed that there was a deficit of 700,000 pesos, with which Torralba was held responsible. Almost all members of the Audiencia were arrested, Torralba included, with the restored Villa as the only auditor remaining in service. By 1719, the shortage of auditors were evident. This led Governor Bustamante to consider releasing Torralba and reinstate him as auditor. However, Archbishop Francisco de la Cuesta contested this move, excommunicating Torralba for his acts against the Church during his administration. Meanwhile, Torralba sent warrants of arrest against his enemies, forcing them to seek sanctuary. As this happened, the Church called upon the people to march to the palace, leading to the death of Bustamante on 11 October 1719. With the governor's demise, Torralba was made to respond for his residencia. Thus, Torralba was investigated for his and Bustamante's administrations. Despite the problems confronted by the Torralba administration, his residencia revealed that there was good progress being done in the two years he was governor. Various public works were undertaken, resulting to the repair of warehouses, hospitals, and churches. Intramuros was restored and new bronze cannons were installed in the walls. He also attempted to boost the morale of the colonial troops by focusing on military reforms and promotions. However, military officers viewed his attempt as encroachment of their authority. In 1716, Torralba's financial account submitted to King Philip V of Spain noted that there was actually a surplus of 294,000 pesos, with a net gain of 38,554 pesos. This is conflicting with the reported deficit of 700,000 pesos. Nevertheless, the residencia of Torralba caused his imprisonment and payment of fines as decided by the Council of the Indies. The original fine of 20,000 pesos was increased to 100,000 pesos, forcing him to poverty until his death in 1726.

As he climbed the ladder of Chinese bureaucracy, he became in charge of several provinces as supreme commander, and was involved in the conflicts such as the suppression of the Yao rebellions in the southwestern frontier and the defence of China from wokou pirates. At the height of his power, he was in charge of the military in six provinces, an unprecedented number in the Ming dynasty. Despite winning a great victory against the pirates in 1555, he quickly fell from power by running afoul of the domineering clique of Yan Song and Zhao Wenhua, and was executed by the Jiajing Emperor later in the same year. Early career A native of Houguan county (侯官縣; present-day Fuzhou) of Fujian province, Zhang Jing was noted as a man of tall stature. He took the imperial examinations and received the jinshi degree in 1517 under the name Cai Jing, a name which he retained for close to twenty years since. He first served in the government bureaucracy as a magistrate in the city of Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, a position he held from 1521 to 1525, and from there went into the capital Beijing as a supervising secretary (). There he found favour from the Jiajing Emperor, and successively rose to the positions of vice minister of the Court of the Imperial Stud (), right vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review (), right vice censor-in-chief (), and the grand coordinator of Shandong (). After two years in this last appointment, he was promoted to be the supreme commander of Guangdong and Guangxi in 1537, with the rank of a vice minister of war (). Service in the southwest As supreme commander of the southern provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, the conflicts of Ming China's southwestern borders and beyond became part of Zhang Jing's responsibility. In Guangxi, violence associated with the bandits and the indigenous Yao people of the Rattan Gorge (藤峽; Tengxia) in southeastern Guangxi had long been troubling the region despite the great suppression campaigns of Han Yong in 1465 and Wang Yangming in 1528. For decades, the ravenous jungles of the Rattan Gorge had sheltered several thousand native brigands, who could easily spill out along the Qianjiang River to conduct raids. In the name of quelling local disturbances, Zhang Jing committed 51,000 troops to dislodge the Yao and the bandits from the gorge in 1539, and took up to 1,350 heads in the operation while receiving the surrender of three thousand men and women. The operation brought some degree of Ming control to the Rattan Gorge area and demonstrated Chinese military might to neighbouring Vietnam, itself on the verge of war with China. In Vietnam, the Ming tributary state ruled by the Lê dynasty was overthrown by Mạc Đăng Dung in 1527 and declared himself emperor of a new Mạc dynasty. The Ming court in Beijing sided with the ousted Lê house and wished to punish the usurper by sending an expeditionary force into Vietnam in 1538. Zhang Jing, being acutely aware of the situation on the ground, memorialized the throne against war, arguing that the manpower and resources of his territorial command could not support such a campaign. The Jiajing emperor shelved the campaign because of the memorial, but brought it up again the next year. Obligated to follow a policy that he did not agree with, Zhang Jing sought peace with Mạc Đăng Dung while trying portray the peace as a victory for the Ming. He advised Mao Bowen (), the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary forces, to concentrate troops on the border but not to engage the Mạc men in battle. The presence of the Chinese forces on the border was enough to threaten Mạc Đăng Dung into submission. Zhang Jing worked with Mạc Đăng Dung to make sure the latter wrote a letter of surrender that was acceptable to the Ming court. In the end, Mạc Đăng Dung declared his submission to the Ming in a ceremony at Zhennan Pass in 1540, and the Ming allowed Mạc to rule northern Vietnam. A major war was averted. Zhang Jing went on to subdue the aboriginals tribes in western Guangxi and Hainan Island, and was awarded the rank of minister of War and right censor-in-chief () for his services. He remained in the southwest until 1544, when he relinquished his post to mourn the death of his father in accordance with Confucian filial rites. Wokou crisis Zhang Jing returned to public service in 1546 under his original surname Zhang, when he was appointed as supreme commander of Shaanxi, but the emperor withdrew the appointment after Zhang Jing was accused of irregularities in handling military funds during his time in Guangdong. In 1551, Zhang Jing was once again called upon to take the position of Minister of Revenue in Nanjing, the secondary capital, but was prevented from doing so because of the death of his mother. Upon returning from his period of mourning in 1553, he served as the Nanjing Minister of Revenue for two months before being transferred to become the Nanjing Minister of War. Unlike the other largely ceremonial minister roles in Nanjing, the Nanjing Minister of War could lead troops and was expected to play a part in the defence of the southern provinces. At this time the eastern seaboard was under attack by the pirates known as the \\"wokou\\", and Zhang Jing's assignment to the position was part of the Ming court's response to the onslaught. A new supreme commander position was eventually created for the first time in this area, overseeing an unprecedented six coastal provinces: Shandong, the Southern Metropolitan Region, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Zhang Jing was assigned to this position on 17 June 1554. To focus on his military command, Zhang Jing asked to be relieved of his ministerial duties, and the request was granted on 8 November. To dislodge the pirates from their stronghold of Zhelin () southeast of Shanghai, Zhang Jing called in reinforcements from Shandong, Guangxi, and Huguang. 6000 recruits from Shandong arrived first, but they suffered a devastating defeat and had to disband. Zhang Jing decided to gather his strength and wait for the 11,000 aboriginal troops to arrive. However, the apparent lethargy with which Zhang Jing carried out his mission attracted criticism. His critics also point out that Zhang was an arrogant man who led a luxurious lifestyle, and lacked in tact when dealing with others, especially his subordinates. With the tremendous power he held, Zhang Jing would punish officers for private matters like giving him an angry look, and once even flogged a vice-prefect for criticizing him — never since the establishment of the dynasty had a vice- prefect been treated this way. He also refused to work with Zhao Wenhua, the commissioner sent by the emperor to scrutinize his actions, since he considered himself above Zhao's rank. Zhao Wenhua, however, had considerable influence since he was a protege of the Senior Grand Secretary Yan Song, who controlled the imperial court. Zhao Wenhua had urged Zhang Jing to attack the pirates, but Zhang Jing resisted and would not even discuss his strategy with him, so Zhao retaliated by writing a memorial to the throne accusing Zhang Jing of deliberately delaying the operation for his own profit. Zhang Jing's plan was to starve the pirates out of their base in Zhelin while waiting for the Ming reinforcements to arrive. The pirates were compelled to leave their fortified positions and were waylaid by Ming forces in the Battle of Wangjiangjing (), north of Jiaxing, on 10 May 1555. Zhang Jing and his generals Lu Tang and Yu Dayou unleashed the newly arrived aboriginal troops onto the pirates and took 1,900 heads in what became the greatest Ming victory so far in the anti-wokou campaign. Despite the great triumph, Zhao Wenhua's denouncement of Zhang Jing reached Beijing, where Zhao's mentor Yan Song convinced the emperor that the victory proved that Zhang Jing had the capability to defeat the pirates, only striking when he heard about Zhao Wenhua's accusation against him. Infuriated, the emperor ordered Zhang Jing's arrest on 5 June. Death Yan Song's indictment of Zhang Jing was endorsed by Yan's political rivals, the Grand Secretaries Xu Jie and Lü Ben (), who were natives of the pirate-plagued districts and thus acutely aware of the situation under Zhang Jing's command. When Zhang Jing was brought to Beijing for investigation, he tried to bribe the three grand secretaries to the tune of tens of thousands in money, but none would accept. The Jiajing Emperor, wishing to make an example of Zhang Jing for his inaction, sentenced him to death despite his pleas. He was executed on 12 November 1555 along with Yang Jisheng, a known critic of Yan Song. His supreme commander position was seen as too powerful, so his successor's command was limited to only the Southern Metropolitan Region, Zhejiang, and Fujian. Later commentators lamented the tragic fate of Zhang Jing, who was rewarded with execution for his victory at Wangjiangjing. Despite the unanimous decision of the three grand secretaries, numerous commentators blamed his death on Yan Song and Zhao Wenhua, who had become reviled figures in Ming historiography. On 5 July 1600, the charges against Zhang Jing were cleared, his official titles were restored, and he was given the posthumous name Xiangmin ().

Some believe the poem was originally of ancient Greek origin due to the nature of the subject matter, and suggest that it should be included in the Epic Cycle as an essential albeit incomplete work. Only fragments of the story were preserved which tell of a great but evil queen, Eussouis, who sought to take control of the kingdom her husband, King Orteian, had lost after being banished for having wooed his brother's young daughter, Scaelus. Once the former subjects of Eussouis learned of the deceptive methods she utilized to inspire them to rise up and regain control of the lost kingdom for her, they turned on her, capturing both her and Orteian and beheaded them in a public ceremony. Scaelus was then awarded the wealth that was left behind as restitution for her years of suffering.

Inman is also the founder of the website The Oatmeal.  Gameplay  The deck consists of two types of cards: bears and babies. Bears are built; they come in the form of heads, torsos, arms and legs. The player can connect the cards where they fit to form an army of creatures in front of them. Babies are played immediately into the center of the table. They form a baby army, which must be stopped by the player's bearlike creatures. War is initiated by provoking the babies with a provoke card. The babies attack all of the players' creatures at once. The player wins or loses the round based on the strength of their creature compared to the strength of the baby horde. Strength is determined by the sum of points indicated on each card. The main strategy is to provoke the baby army before the player's opponents' creatures are strong enough to win. There are additional cards in the deck to help the player strengthen their army, or attack the others players' creatures. These cards consist of Hats, tools, and weapons. The winner is determined by the player that has the highest point total of (b)eaten babies.  Background  Although it is the second game released by Lee and Inman, Bears vs Babies's earliest stages date back to 2012. Lee told VentureBeat in an October 2016 interview that they began working on the game together within two weeks of the initial shipments of Exploding Kittens.  Kickstarter  Proposed as a Kickstarter project seeking $10,000 USD in crowdfunding, it far exceeded the goal within the first day of the campaign, eventually raising $3,215,679 making it the 10th most funded board game on Kickstarter of all time.

Entry from rooftop stairs Entrance from Forest Road  Transport  The Eastern Suburbs and Illawara rail link offers frequent train services to Hurstville station located opposite the centre. Westfield Hurstville has bus connections to the Riverwood, Bankstown, Beverly Hills, Lugarno, Kogarah, Kingsgrove, Burwood, Parramatta, as well as local surrounding suburbs. It is served by Punchbowl Bus Company, Transit Systems Sydney and Transdev NSW services. Majority of its bus services located in Forest Road in front of the railway station. Westfield Hurstville also has multi level car parks with 2,745 spaces.  History  Westfield Hurstville officially opened on 9 October 1978 by then NSW Premier Neville Wran. The centre was first announced in 1975 with a cost of $30 million was hailed as \\"the start of a new and greater shopping era for St George\\". It was a joint venture between the council and Westfield. The centre featured Coles New World, Waltons (originally located at Southside Plaza at Rockdale), Nock & Kirby, Spacetacular, McDonalds, Franklins and Best & Less. It was the first shopping centre in Australia to feature a quiet park on top of the centre. The park was known as Snowy Hill Park which was named after former alderman and mayor of Hurstville, Gordon William 'Snowy' Hill. Hill who served 19 years at the council, being elected mayor in 1962 and 1963. He died on 2 June 1978. The decision to name the park in recognition of Hill's services to the local community was made at a Special Hurstville Municipal Meeting shortly after his death. A pedestrian ramp from Croft's Avenue was constructed to allow pedestrian access to the park from street level. The park was officially opened by Mr Kevin Ryan MLA, former mayor of Hurstville, on 7 April 1979 and was popular for shoppers who wanted a quiet break from shopping. In 1987, the Waltons chain was sold by Alan Bond to the Cookes family in which the remaining stores split into Venture and Norman Ross. Westfield Hurstville was redeveloped extended across Park Road towards The Avenue with a retail bridge linking both sides of the centre in the 1990s. Grace Bros, Kmart, Greater Union cinema and 125 speciality stores were added to the centre as part of the extension. The celebration of the opening of the redevelopment and the opening of Grace Bros was held on 10 April 1990. The opening of the store was popular with hundreds of locals queuing up to snap up a bargain which took one hour for the store to make $51,000 in sales. The Grace Bros store was originally planned to open in the Southside Plaza at Rockdale, but due to David Jones planning to open a Hurstville store, with a possible site near the current location of Hurstville Library on Queens Road, Grace Bros amended the plan and opened at Hurstville. Venture, which took over Norman Ross, relocated from its original space to the space next to Grace Bros. Snowy Hill park was later converted to the rooftop carpark. The Greater Union opened at the end of June which breathed life into what was a ghost town after 5pm. After the redevelopment of the centre, shops on Forest Road started to decline after the centre took trade away from the street and the plans for a pedestrian mall on Forest Road, to be known as Forest Road Mall or Hurstville Boulevard, were proposed. In the early 1990s, Westfield Hurstville was a place for local youths to loiter especially in the cinemas and the food court area with many complaints from shoppers and tenants about teenagers harassing the public. A brawl took place in the food court on 13 May 1992, fortunately no one was injured and no property was damaged. To combat this a mini food court was proposed on the southern end of level 3. Ten retail stores were converted to food court outlets and seating for 32 people were added. In the mid 1990s, many high-end stores and stores such as Brashs and Intencity closed. Intencity previously opened in 1995 and was the first in the chain to open on the space vacated by BBC Hardware and part of Waltons until it was taken over by Target in 1997. The Toys \\"R\\" Us store (which replaced the two-level Venture store in 1993) shrunk to become a one-level store with the bottom level of the store taken over by Rebel Sport which then was taken over by Aldi. By 1998, Westfield Hurstville was beginning to experience a downturn in trade. Nearby Westfield Miranda had been expanded in recent years, Roselands was redeveloped in 1992 and Westfield Burwood was proposed for demolition to be replaced by a more modern shopping centre. The building was starting to age and many stores had closed. Franklins closed in 2001 and was taken over by Food For Less in 2002 and operated until November 2015 when Woolworths opened at the other end of the centre. Food For Less was taken over by Tong Li Supermarket and a medical centre. Grace Bros (renamed to Myer in 2004) became sole department store until its closure in early 2015. Despite having many variety stores added, the centre was criticised from 2015 and onwards for lack of high-end retailers, department stores and having too many discount and cheap stores. It was also criticised for being run down and in need of redevelopment.  Recent development  In early 2015, Myer made a departure from the centre after deciding to not renew their lease and was followed by Toys \\"R\\" Us. On March 2015, the centre underwent a $100 million redevelopment which was completed by 18 November 2015. The centre celebrated the opening of the redevelopment on 19 November 2015. The redevelopment consists of: * A full line Woolworths and JB Hi-Fi on the lower floor of the former Myer space * A Big W and Cotton On on the upper floor of the former Myer space. * A Rebel Sport was added to the centre on the half of Kmart * A new relocated Best & Less on the space vacated by Toys \\"R\\" Us * A rooftop alfresco dining precinct. * A refurbished Greater Union Cinema renamed Event Cinemas which added a large VMAX screen (the largest in the Southern Hemisphere) * New floor finishes, lighting, ceiling treatments, furniture and soft furnishings * New ticketless, number-plate recognition system parking Westfield Hurstville is expected to reach an average of $17 million in spending and can support a trade area of over 329,000 people.  Future = Apartments  Plans for six towers up to 20 storeys high and containing 1249 units could be built above the centre under a planning proposal before Georges River Council. The towers would be approximately 18 to 20 storeys above the existing centre from the top of the roof carpark and each tower would include 456 residential apartments, 793 mixed use units consisting of serviced apartments and student accommodation. There are also requests to increase the floor space of the development. If approved by the council, the planning proposal will go to the Department of Planning for Gateway before being put on exhibition for public comment. The plans are expected to be finalised by March 2018.  New department stores  A new major department store to replace the existing Target store and adjacent mini major at a cost $15.3 million was announced on 6 January 2018. There are also plans for two additional retail shops at the Rose Street entry to the centre and a relocated and expanded centre management office on the rooftop area on level five. This development was approved by Georges River Council on 21 June 2018. There were speculations that the new department store would be David Jones, however the company has declined to comment. On July 2019, it was then announced that three new mini-majors would replace the previous Target store, including a Uniqlo on the right-hand side which opened on 19 September 2019, a TK Maxx on the left which opened on 12 September 2019, and another retailer (yet to be revealed) in the middle, as well as a JD Sports, which opened on 10 October 2019 in the former adjacent mini major space.  Tenants  Westfield Hurstville has 62,044m² of floor space. The major retailers include Kmart, Big W, Aldi, Coles, Woolworths, Cotton On, Uniqlo, TK Maxx, JB Hi-Fi, Rebel Sport and Event Cinemas.

The school was founded through its association with the Prussian Academy of Arts, and after unification stood as one of Berlin's art schools for over 70 years. The school went through a number of changes in name and emphasis before its closure in the 1945/46 academic season. Its programs and assets were eventually integrated into the present-day Berlin University of the Arts.  History  Architect Martin Gropius was the school's organizer and first director. The program developed from two existing schools within the Academy, an \\"arts and trade union school\\" and a drawing school.\\"einer Kunst- und Gewerkschule und einer Zeichenschule hervor\\"; Gropius also designed their new building at Klosterstraße 75 (demolished in 1931). After German unification, the art school in 1872 expanded into teacher education. In 1874 women were first admitted. On the death of Gropius in 1880, painter Ernst Ewald assumed the directorship. (Ewald was simultaneously the director of the small teaching institute at the State Museum of Decorative Arts.) Impressionist painter Philipp Franck became director in 1915, after the beginning of World War I. When painter Elise Blumann completed a two-year course at the school between 1917 and 1919, as a woman she could choose from the School of Applied Arts, the Berlin School for Women Arts founded in 1868, and the Royal School of Art. The Academy did not accept female fine arts students until October 1919. Blumann graduated with an art teacher's diploma. Following the 1918 abdication of the Kaiser and the German Revolution of 1918–19, the establishment was renamed the State Art School of Berlin (Staatliche Kunstschule zu Berlin), and moved into new purpose-built facilities at Grunewaldstraße 2-5, Schöneberg. Painter Alexander Kanoldt assumed the directorship in 1933, as the Nazis came to power. His work would eventually be seized and destroyed as degenerate art. Kanoldt resigned in 1936, and the school was renamed the State College of Arts (Staatliche Hochschule für Kunsterziehung). Hans Zimbal was among its final directors in the war years before its closure in 1945.

Anti-Thai sentiment began to flare in Cambodia because of Cambodians' fear of Thai designs on western Cambodia. That led to a violent protest in January 2003 in which the Thai embassy was burned and Thai businesses were vandalised after a Cambodian newspaper article falsely alleged that a Thai actress had claimed that Angkor Wat belonged to Thailand and that it should take over the ancient temple.

On 22 August 2015, a European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism, a county commemoration for victims of all anti-fascistic and communistic crimes in Croatia, was held here.

It was produced by Winans' own independent production company, Double Edge Films, with Kiowa K. Winans, and shot by cinematographer Robert Muratore in locations around Denver, Colorado. This is the follow up to the 2009 science fiction fantasy film Ink also written and directed by Jamin Winans. The Frame played at the 2015 Sitges Film Festival in Spain, the 2015 Imagine Film Festival in Amsterdam and the 2015 Fantaspoa Film Festiva l in Brazil.  Plot  Alex (David Carranza), a methodical cargo thief working for a dangerous cartel narrowly escapes arrest after an elaborate semi truck heist is reduced to a foot chase in the opening scene. Alex plans ahead and disappears into a crowd to avoid capture. Sam (Tiffany Mualem), an empathetic and tough paramedic pulls up to the scene of domestic violence and runs into the house before cops arrive. Sam manages to save a battered woman and protect herself and the daughter from a belligerent husband. Clearly rattled by her day job and trying to reconcile seeing pain every day, Sam visits her therapist and talks about her wish to make everything better but recognizes the futility. Home after collecting his pay for the recent heist, Alex stashes it in a hidden wall safe and turns on the TV to eat dinner. We see he's intently watching a television show which happens to be the scene with Sam the paramedic we just saw happen in real time. Sam is the star of the show called Urban Hope. Sam, home after her therapist visit, sits eating dinner in front of the TV and watches Alex's recent heist and escape with the intensity of a true fan. Alex's show is called Thieves and Saints. Late one evening, as the two have their televisions on they realize that they are broadcast live from their living rooms on the others TV set. They say hello, panic, and turn off their TV's. Each handles the impossibility in a different way – Sam expresses to her Therapist she may be losing her mind and Alex believes the cartel or cops have him under surveillance. Alex visits his mentor Noah (Cal Bartlett) who is sick and elderly but who seems to be the only person Alex has in the world. Noah senses Alex is in danger and reminds him he's living in a dark world of his own creation and sends him home with the violin Alex played as a child. Alex is reluctant to take the violin as it is a reminder of something painful in his past – a clue we received when he almost accidentally ruined a photo of him with his parents and the violin as a young boy. Alex and Sam continue to see each other randomly through their televisions and attempt to unwind the mystery by setting a meeting point at her apartment and later at a bridge. Both are met with bizarre interactions with Alex's Cartel Boss showing up in one form on the bridge in his world, Sam's Therapist showing up in another form on the bridge in her world and in front of her apartment as a dark character riding a bizarre black tar-spewing bicycle. We realize these characters are one and the same, crossing the boundaries between their worlds and morphing into different forms. We also realize that Sam and Alex have the additional connection of music between the two worlds – Sam hums a beautiful melody from the bridge and Alex taps his hand to the same count and we see a mysterious vibration around them. The violin that Noah gave to Alex keeps appearing in Alex's apartment and is something that Alex wishes to make go away so he repeatedly puts it away in the closet. Back out again on a moving box, the camera pans across the room and knocks the violin off the box with the left frame line. There is definitely some kind of surveillance happening in Alex's world but it isn't the cartel or the cops. Something else is watching him. The menacing Therapist, Cartel Boss and Black Tar Mechanic characters (all played by Christopher Soren Kelly) continue to distract and thwart them each from believing that the connection on the television is legitimate. Alex has one last heist to pull and Sam sees that his show is ending – that the advertised Season Finale of Thieves and Saints is the final heist. Sam pleads with Alex not to go on the heist, that she doesn't know what will happen to him and perhaps there is a fate worse than being caught by the cops or killed by the cartel. Sam wonders if there is a writer to his show – is some production company in charge of both of their stories? Alex fires back, angry at the idea that a writer would write him such a horrific life. Sam says either everything is chaos or everything is a miracle. Alex is certain everything is chaos. On a hunch, Sam researches the Thieves and Saints production company website. The final heist in Thieves and Saints has Alex gunning down most of his crew to save an innocent bystander family. Alex takes a shot to the gut in the shootout as Sam watches panicked at her TV. Alex stumbles home and sees her on his TV and she pleads with him to call an ambulance. He fears being caught, he thinks the cartel are everywhere and he is content to die with the connection to Sam from his apartment. Knowing he doesn't have much longer, Sam asks Alex to hum a melody with her. It's the same melody she was humming at the bridge and as Alex joins in, both of their worlds begin to vibrate. Alex weakens, takes his final breath and Sam sits stunned pleading with him not to leave her. She springs into action remembering she had found the Thieves and Saints production company address and drives there only to be stopped by her Therapist who has been looking for her, fearing she is not mentally well. She runs past him into the building and to the floor of the Thieves and Saints writer's office. A 60's dressed secretary sits in a small lobby staring at a phone and asks how Sam is doing. Sam goes through the only door in the room and finds herself in a vacuous room – on one side extending to infinite black and the other with spools feeding into a typing machine. She exits the other side which takes her back into the secretary's office and has the same short conversation as if on a repeating loop. Finally she summons the courage to walk toward the typing machine in the vacuous room and sees a projection image above the machine showing Alex on the floor of his apartment. The typing machine deposits the final page for “Thieves and Saints: Episode 50”. Sam picks up the script and flips through, seeing everything that had happened up to this point in his show. Sam is able to write onto the script and change Alex's fate, reviving him from death. Changing the script sets off a cascade of changing events that Sam struggles to keep up with as she drives through the city to escape her persistent Therapist. Humming her favorite melody nervously and paying more attention to the script than the road, Sam's car is hit by oncoming traffic and spun around. In her final desperate attempt to save Alex from his ever-changing script, she burns it. Shortly thereafter another car crashes into her and kills her. At that moment, everyone in Alex's world disintegrates into black tar and the traffic, noise and activity come to a halt. Alex sits catatonic for a few moments then walks around the vacant city in wonder. He passes by an antique shop with an old television playing Sam's show and he sees her car accident and final demise. As he's reeling from her death, he turns around to find Sam's Therapist morph from the TV into the Black Tar Mechanic standing right behind him. The Mechanic delivers a bizarre speech – beginning with 'all that was left was the man and the devil, trapped in the writer's creation. ' Alex realizes he is in fact written and that the only person left in the world with him is the devil. The devil is determined to erase the world with his black tar machine, with or without Alex in it. Alex returns home with earlier scenes from Sam's show playing on a loop. He wanders the city a bit, always aware there is something over his shoulder watching him. Out of paranoia he looks back but nothing. He is despondent, exhausts his remaining food and is entirely alone but for Sam's reruns and a massive ugly machine spewing black tar into the sky and blocking out the sun. He sees that Sam burned his script. This gives him the idea to do the same – what if he could find the writer's office too? Arriving in the same strange secretary's room at the production company, it is also vacant. No signs of life anywhere. Alex opens the door to the vacuous room and hears typing on the far end. As he walks toward the sound of the typewriter, he sees a projection of himself in that moment repeating into infinity. He turns back and stares directly into the camera – aware for the first time that the camera is the entity who is watching him. He approaches the typewriter and sees a full script sitting in the paper tray called 'The Frame'. The script describes the exact moment we're seeing, Alex becoming aware of the script and storyteller and writer. He stumbles backward in disbelief and the left side of the camera frame hits him in the back. He moves in the opposite direction and finds the other side of The Frame. After challenging both sides, The Frame lifts him up and tilts him backwards and he mysteriously wakes up at home. Contemplating his encounter with this mysterious force, he draws a square, then two arrows: one pointing left and one pointing right toward both edges. He then pokes a hole through the paper and realizes he needs to run away from the camera, not toward the edges. Alex, finally ready to test fate and his entrapment, jumps out of his third story window. The Frame catches him gracefully at the bottom of the picture, preventing his death. Alex runs and The Frame pursues him at every turn – Alex smashes into the edges of The Frame. He is angrily reliving his childhood, in which his parents were murdered and his prayer for help went unanswered. He tells the writer to fuck off – that the writer left him. He left him all alone. The writer wrote him a cruel and lonely life and made him do terrible things. Alex heaves his anger one final time at The Frame and passes out on the street. Gently The Frame picks him up and carries him home. Alex again wakes up in his apartment as The Mechanic is closing in on his promise to black out the world. Sam's final episode is still replaying on his TV – she is being pursued by her Therapist and hums nervously while she drives and changes Alex's script. With nothing left to do but surrender, Alex finally reaches for his violin. As he plays, the melody of her humming and his strings combine to merge their two worlds. Alex swings the final note from the intersection in her world which sends the car which had run into and killed her, flying over her instead, leaving her safe. Stunned to see him kneeling on the intersection where she burned his script, she approaches him with disbelief. Sam slowly walks up to him and places her hand warmly on his head. Alex bows in relief. For the first time in the film, The Frame pans off of both characters and blurs to white. Cast Inspirations and themes  Winans told an interviewer for Fast Cheap Movie Thoughts: > \\"Ultimately I wanted to make a movie about the feeling of being abandoned by > God. I wanted to explore the questions of God's existence, God's nature > (benevolent or malevolent) and how we struggle between control and > submission. The writing process for me always starts with images. I'll get > an image of a moment and begin asking questions. Those questions eventually > lead me to knowing the character and what brought him/her to that moment. > With The Frame there were two primary images I started with: a man > physically fighting to get out of a cage, and the man picking up a violin. I > work for months (if not years) on an extensive outline and then write the > actual script fairly quickly.\\" In the same interview, Winans had this to say about the process of writing the score for the film: > \\"I usually start working on the music at the script phase. The music helps > me write and the writing helps me compose. With The Frame I composed about > 75% of it before we started shooting and I was able to use that on set for > key moments. Then, in the edit, I bounced back and forth between cutting and > tweaking the music.\\"  Reception  Film School Rejects gave the film a B+ rating, with Chief Film Critic Rob Hunter writing: > Like Christopher Nolan on a budget, writer/director Jamin Winans (Ink) > creates worlds where imagination and emotion trump logic and traditional > cohesion. That’s not a criticism of either man’s talents — instead it’s just > to say that both place a high premium on the way their films make us feel > and the ideas we’re left to mull over in our minds once the credits have > rolled. Winans’ latest film, The Frame, continues that theme as it presents > viewers with a beautiful, sci-fi tinged love story fueled by fate, > forgiveness and wonder. Jason Heller, writing for Westword in an extensive interview and review writes: > The Frame turns out to be a marvel. It's not anything like Ink, but the vibe > is the same: Normal people full of everyday dreams, faults and fears > suddenly have their foundation of reality yanked out from under them. How > they cope with that crisis is not only intellectually challenging, it's > emotionally devastating.

A member of the strict Tablighi Jamaat branch of Islam, Sareshwala has gained considerable public attention for being a strident supporter and a close confidante of Narendra Modi, the current Prime Minister of India. Biography Sareshwala is a mechanical engineer by training and considered an expert in Islamic banking and finance. In 2001, he organised protests in Delhi against the burning of copies of the Qur'an by Hindus. His family businesses incurred huge losses in the 2002 Gujarat riots, and he was part of a group of Indian expatriates considering filing against Modi at the International Court of Justice for his role in the violence. Sareshwala and Modi subsequently settled their differences, with Sareshwala and his brother meeting cordially with Modi on a visit to London in 2003, and developing close business and political ties since then. Sareshwala's decision to move his family back to India from London in 2005 was said to be on the urging of Modi himself, with Modi asking: \\"Will you continue serving the British as a slave?\\" Since Modi's political ascent to Prime Minister, Sareshwala claims that only by engaging with Modi and the BJP will the interests of Muslims in Gujarat be advanced, and cites multiple examples of political achievements resulting from his links with Modi. However, this position has brought intense criticism upon Sareshwala from fellow Muslims and human rights activists, with many critics accusing him of opportunism, and one commentator dubbing him \\"Modi's PR man in the Muslim world\\". Sareshwala receives much hate mail comparing him with Indians who aided the British during the colonial era. In 2010 Sareshwala, along with Parsoli and its other directors, was barred from the capital market by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for share fraud, for a seven-year period. SEBI took this action against Parsoli and its directors after establishing that the company's directors had defrauded shareholders and transferred shares to themselves. In July 2013 Parsoli's broker registration was cancelled in connection with further violations. Sareshwala's appointment in 2015 as Chancellor of the Maulana Azad National Urdu University was strongly criticised by Muslim groups and other groups affiliated with the university, who alleged that the appointment was a reward for Sareshwala's support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. Zafar Sareshwala has three children.

Unique in Europe, the non-profit organisation brings children, young people and adults together from different cultures and social backgrounds in a playful way through its ongoing pioneering work. The approach develops boys and girls all year round in summer as well as in winter, through continuous leagues in several different age categories. With its special form of participation, integration and identification, buntkicktgut harnesses the power of street football to enhance the social prospects of children and young people, based on the premise that football is a common language that it is understood worldwide. The initiative has given itself the target of bringing together people from different cultural, social, ethnic and religious backgrounds, through their involvement not only as participants, but also as organisers and creators. In addition to the location in Munich, there are now street football leagues following the model and accreditation of buntkicktgut in Dortmund, Berlin, Düsseldorf, Basel, Würzburg and a multi-city league in Niederbayern. Origins buntkickgut was founded in 1996 as a wave of refugees entered Munich fleeing the Yugoslav Wars. It was an initiative of three social workers engaged in refugee work at the time – the geographer Rüdiger Heid as well as students Memo Arikan and Hans Peter Niessner. With their youth teams “Harras Bulls” and “Weigl Heroes” from two social housing developments they laid the foundations for the first league, in the U14 age category. Through football, the founders wanted to break down the inter-cultural barriers and language barriers between the young people. The “Refugee League” grew as more and more teams formed and started playing. Since 1998 it has operated under the name of buntkicktgut. The team “Harras Boys” from Munich – Each year in Munich alone more than 250 teams take part in the street football leagues Moulded according to the vision of cofounder and director Rüdiger Heid, the project expanded and, in Munich alone, it now includes over 2500 participants in over 200 teams from over 100 different countries of origin (correct as of 2015). The most strongly represented countries/regions continue to reflect the origins of the project: as well as former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia, Croatia), these include Kurdistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Palestine, Angola, Togo, DR Congo, Nigeria, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Alongside these, there is an increasing number of participants with migrant backgrounds from EU member states, Turkey, eastern Europe as well as young German people. The leagues (originally supported by the City of Munich Department for Refugees and now by the Initiativgruppe – Interkulturelle Begegnung und Bildung e.V) are firmly established and are being set up in other cities and communities. Through strong cooperation with these institutions, a broad network has been developed with those who provide youth, social and migration work whether independently or on behalf of the community (Kreisjugendring; AWO; Caritas Social Services; Diakonie; Condrobs; Bildungszentren; Kinder- und Mutterschutz e.V.; Verein für Sozialarbeit e.V.)) and involving all relevant government departments (Department for Schooling/Sport; City Youth Department; Streetwork; Department for Health and Environment; Department for Work and Business; Foreign Advisory Council; Regional Committee) Objective Through football, children come into contact with other young people from German and foreign backgrounds. Alongside the prevention of youth crime and violence, the objective of the project is to broaden perspectives and to laying educational foundations for young people who grow up in difficult social or economic conditions. As a team sport, football acts as a catalyst to break down aggression and frustration, whilst improving social interaction and cooperation. At buntkicktgut, children learn to accept others regardless of their situation in life or their cultural background. Through a playful and competitive culture, central values are laid down: fairness, tolerance, participation and non-violence. These values are conveyed in particular through the fundamental attitude of the social worker; through recognition of a role model's actions and behaviour. Leagues The leagues are the central pillar of buntkicktgut's pedagogical programme. Work with children and young people throughout the year is structured around this system. For instance, in the intercultural street football league in the main location of Munich, children and young people between the ages of 7 and 22 play in teams split up into six categories: U11, U13, U15, U17, 17+ and Girls. They play to qualify for the “Champions League” which since April 2006 has run under the motto “Show us your stadium” – with varying locations for matches around the city. Each registered team acts as the host once a season and decides where the match day will take place (e.g. their local recreation ground, school playing fields, park). The match days are organised and coordinated by the buntkicktgut team and the host team. The playing year is split up into a summer and a winter league. Matches are played at recreation grounds, playgrounds, parks and sports halls. Girls are eligible to play in all age categories, and there are therefore no restrictions on the number of girls in a team. To cater to the wishes of many female participants, there is also a separate Girls League. In Munich alone in the 2014 season there were over 200 match days with a total of 2524 matches played on the recreation grounds and parks of Munich. 159 teams took part in the U11, U13, U15, U17, 17+ (Seniors) and Girls (U13-U17) across the whole city. Over the course of the year there were 1091 training sessions, in which around 2500 children and young people took part. Nationwide over 4000 children and young people participated in buntkicktgut, taking part in over 50 training sessions a week and 250 match days per year. Participation Trained Street Football Workers take over responsibility for younger participants and offer training sessions The second pillar of the programme is the active involvement and participation of young people in key decision making processes. “buntkicktgut is a street football league for children and young people by children and young people. Along with scoring goals and presence on the pitch, it is about taking responsibility for yourself, your team and the league.”, says Rüdiger Heid. The buntkicktgut concept of participation consists of six fundamental areas: Street Football Work In districts with points of social conflict, Street Football Workers train individual teams and spread the philosophy of buntkicktgut: fairplay, tolerance, participation and non-violence. Street Football Workers are mostly young people who know the league inside out, play football and have themselves made the leap to overcome difficult social relationships. Training sessions run by Street Football Workers take place once a week all year round With the “Street Football Work” programme and the follow-on “School Football Work” programme, buntkicktgut offers open training sessions in recreational grounds and parks based in targeted districts of the city. Street Football Workers are active in their own city district and undertake responsibility for younger participants there. Every Street Football Worker offers regular training sessions at set times (minimum once a week) for groups/teams of 8-12 children or young people on their “home pitch”, be it the school playground, the rec around the corner, a patch of grass in the park or the courtyard of their block of flats. The training session is open to everyone. The teams take part in the city leagues, which span all city districts and run all year round in the form of a summer and a winter season. On top of that there are regular events, camps, and tournaments for special occasions. An important component of the project is the unique organisation of the teams and the assumption of responsibility by young people in the different areas of participation. From this independence and responsibility stems a dynamic which keeps the leagues alive and running. League Council At the buntkicktgut League Council all problems from the leagues are discussed The League Council makes rules, monitors compliance with the rules by participants and teams, resolves conflicts, and determines bans or other sanctions. For instance, in Munich, the League Council is composed of the official buntkicktgut referees, who have successfully completed their training. In regular sittings (once or twice a month) they ensure the smooth running of the league and learn to manage responsibility and act conscientiously. The League Council also has the goal of improving identification with others through participation and therefore creating a better understanding of the problems of the different leagues. buntkicker The street football magazine buntkicker is published by a youth editorial team in online and print form and serves not only to shape identity and build confidence, but also as an educational tool. It includes match reports, interviews, team and player portraits from the leagues, as well as reports and commentaries on important themes which affect the young people of buntkicktgut. Joining the editorial team is seen as a creative and educational opportunity for players, allowing them to improve their own and others’ language skills. Those interested gain a first impression of editorial work and thus acquire key skills for the job, utilising computers, the internet and multimedia technology. Learn-Camps Engagement through editorial work – the editorial team of the street football magazine “buntkicker” As well as the continual leagues, buntkicktgut offers additional holiday programmes in cooperation with various partners. For instance the programme “buntkochtgut” is a football nutrition workshop, in which children aged 11 to 13 cook together and thus learn about healthy eating. Additionally, participants learn how they should act in the case of injury and receive intense football training sessions. Alongside paramedics and specialists in nutrition, the Learn Camps are run by buntkicktgut participants who themselves gain valuable experiences. A further programme that is organised by buntkicktgut is a language development scheme for primary school children which in particular benefits children from migrant backgrounds. It closes the hole in early language development and moreover bridges the school holidays. The project combines language development and football in a single holistic learning experience. It aims to prevent the early formation of a gap in individuals’ prospects compared to those of their native German counterparts and to improve children's chances of academic and extracurricular success. Of particular note in these Learn Camps is the creation of new partnerships in neighbourhoods and the integration of different skills. Referees and officials Participating children and young people can also contribute to buntkickgut as referees at match days and tournaments. buntkicktgut's specialist course for referees consists of two classroom-based sessions and culminates in a written exam. In this way, the rules are enforced by young referees instead of adults. The referees have an important function as mediators on and off the pitch. Through this, young people learn how to deal with responsibility, to remain unbiased despite friendships, to put ethnic differences behind them and to referee matches fairly. Representative teams The representative team from buntkicktgut become world champions as “Team Germany” at the FC Bayern Youth Cup 2014 Special talents and players from buntkicktgut may play for one of the intercultural street football league's representative teams – e.g. FC Interculturale München. Every buntkicktgut location has a representative team which competes at events, festivals and international trial tournaments (like the FC Bayern Youth Cup). ‘Open door’ ethos It is not only the small financial contribution (entry fee from €30 per team) to the street football league that attracts children and young people to buntkicktgut. The offices in the old fire station in Munich's West Side are a port of call for active players, past and future. No matter what reason brings them there, the doors of the offices are always open to young people. The employees and the participating young people fulfil their organisational tasks and also provide an educational service. The ‘open door’ ethos removes the barrier between coaches and players, and promotes direct interaction with the children. As a result, the young people get to know the daily routine and organisational structure of an ambitious, dynamic social project like buntkicktgut from both the inside and the outside. Refugee work buntkicktgut offers up to 30 training sessions for refugees in Munich alone. Here is a group from a refugee camp in the Olympic Stadium in Munich The buntkicktgut street football workers (SFW) organise and run training sessions for refugees. In and around Munich alone, 30 training sessions are put on weekly involving 400 to 600 refugees, mostly unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs). Also in the buntkicktgut locations in Berlin, Dortmund, Düsseldorf and Niederbayern (Straubing, Dingolfing and Landshut) the street football workers are experiencing increasing demand for sports programmes for young immigrants. One aim which buntkicktgut has successfully met for 20 years (see Origins) is to give children and young people a space to play and to develop in the intercultural street football league. It is a place to have fun, offering an escape from the daily grind in refugee camps and their often dramatic tales of flight from their home country. It injects some fun into the players’ day-to-day lives, creates trust and, through the work of the street football workers, builds confidence. The Street Football Workers often have migrant backgrounds themselves, and see eye to eye with the UMFs, having once faced similar difficulties to them. buntkickgut open 2009 – presentation ceremony with a former German football goalkeeper Oliver Kahn. Events=Tournaments Two participants in the buntkicktgut-open: UniCredit Cup 2015 on the Leopoldstraße in Munich Alongside the regular leagues, buntkicktgut organises different tournaments every year (called “buntkicktgut- opens”) which are open to teams from all age groups that don't take part in the regular leagues. Included in these are the UniCredit Cup (Säbener Straße 2009, Olympiapark 2010, Königsplatz 2011, UEFA Champions League Final 2012, Corso Leopold as part of the Streetlife Festival (“Meet the Street”) 2013, Corso Leopold/Streetlife Festival in cooperation with Terre Des Hommes (“Kinder.Straße.Raum.”). In 2013 buntkicktgut held a tournament as part of the 6th Street Football Network Festival 2013. In 2015 the winners of the buntkicktgut-open on the Corso Leopold qualified for the “Road to Berlin”, competing in the Champions Cup in the Ministergärten in Berlin. 2015 also saw the CrossCultureCup, played in front of the Brandenburg Gate during the “Champions Week” in which politicians, celebrities, former players, and the players of buntkicktgut formed individual teams. The organisation of tournaments and standalone events for special occasions like fetes, festivals or remembrance days (e.g. “Day of Public Monuments/European Heritage Days”, Streetlife Festival, City District Weeks, ispo Munich, World Festival of Street football 2006 or the FC Bayern Youth Cup) give players the opportunity to gain experience and mix with children and young people outside the normal leagues. The same is true of the buntkicktgut referees, who are used nationwide for fetes, festivals, tournaments and the “PlayStation Junior Soccer Cup Series” in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Holiday camps and youth mobilisation Camps, outings, trips, and youth exchanges offer the children and young people of buntkicktgut the opportunity to “look past the end of their own nose”, i.e. to broaden their horizons and to make new contacts. These excursions are also an irreplaceable sphere of learning for identification, team spirit and social responsibility. Examples are the summer camps supported by the EU and local partner initiatives in 2011 (Lepoglava, Croatia), 2012 (Katy Wroclawskie, Poland), 2013 (Subotica, Serbia), 2014 (Szombathely, Hungary), 2015 (Carcassonne, France) and 2016 (Lutherstadt Eisleben, Germany). Sport and development Playing with participants in their homeland – buntkicktgut at the “Coupe de l’amitié” in Sokodé, Togo buntkicktgut supports its players not only in Germany but also in their engagement in and for their homelands. The potential for collaboration with diaspora/migrant organisations with civil society organisations in Germany and in other countries is immense because the young people involved are real and tangible role models here and back home. Since 2010 buntkicktgut has been active in the city of Sokodé in Togo, West Africa. Sokodé is the hometown of long term player turned buntkicktgut employee Oussman Kofia. Since 2011, he has shown players from buntkicktgut his hometown once a year as part of the “Festekpé” regional festival of culture and the “Coupe de l’amitié” football tournament. Together with his father Bagna in 2013 he played an important role in founding the “Commission for Sport & Development” in Sokodé. Since 2015 Sokodé has counted as one of the official buntkicktgut locations. Results For buntkicktgut in Dortmund, Neven Subotić is active as patron – here at the season's opener in the Nordstadt district. According to the buntkicktgut vision, football is a tool enabling young people to experience success. Through active participation, buntkickgut's players learn the rules of football, how to be respectful, and how to manage and resolve conflict. Since 1997 over 40 000 children and young people from over 100 countries have taken part. Furthermore, the concept and methods of buntkicktgut are being copied by other communities, foundations and clubs in other cities and regions. The project stems from the principle that younger children can learn from older children. Older children are trained and then put in a position of responsibility for the younger children. The leagues offer a place where conflicts are not shut out entirely, but occur in the controlled context of football where there are conflict resolution mechanisms in place, instead of elsewhere in more dangerous places. Street football works not least as an outlet for releasing aggression. Recognition and awards In December 2000 buntkicktgut was distinguished with the “Münchner Lichtblicke” (“Munich Ray of Light”) award from the Lord Major Christian Ude, Lichterkette e.V. and the Munich Foreign Office. In August 2002 the project received the first prize in the Integration Competition 2002 “Putting Words into Action”, awarded by the President Johannes Rau in Bellevue Castle. In 2007 buntkicktgut won the Integration Prize from the German Football Association and Mercedes-Benz. In 2012 the buntkicktgut branch in Dortmund was also awarded the Integration Prize from the German Football Association and Mercedes-Benz. In December 2014 buntkicktgut was singled out by the Federal Agency for Political Education in the competition “Active for Democracy and Tolerance”. In 2015 Dirk Nowitzki awarded buntkicktgut the accreditation of the analysis company PHINEO. New locations The multi-award-winning buntkicktgut blueprint for work with children and young people is being imitated in other communities nationwide according to the model of the Munich project. Above all, the education of Street Football Workers will be centrally coordinated across the network. Currently buntkicktgut is active in Munich, Düsseldorf and Dortmund, Berlin- Neukölln, Berlin-Kreuzberg, Basel, Würzburg, and Niederbayern (Straubing, Dingolfing, Landshut u.a.). Patronage Oliver Kahn was active as patron for buntkicktgut from 2005 to 2010. Currently, Bayern Munich player Jérôme Boateng is engaged in the whole buntkicktgut project. The patron of buntkicktgut Dortmund is Borussia Dortmund player Neven Subotic. In Berlin Dilek Kolat, the Senator for Work, Integration and Women, acts as patron for buntkicktgut. On top of this, the Neukölln Major Dr. Franziska Giffey, the Councillor Jan- Christoph Rämer (City Council for Education, Schools, Culture and Sport in Neukölln) and Councillor Falko Liecke (City Council for Youth and Health) are patrons for the street football league in Neukölln.

It has varying amounts of rough, imperfectly shed ribbons of brownish bark and smooth whitish to grey bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between eleven and twenty one, and conical to flattened hemispherical fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus decipiens is a mallee or small tree that typically grows to high and wide and forms a lignotuber. It has varying amounts of rough, flaky, greyish brown ribbony bark and smooth grey to pinkish bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly elliptic to almost round, dull bluish green leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, thick, dull, grey-green and lance-shaped with a hook-like tip. They are long and wide on a flattened petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between eleven and twenty one on a peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between August and January and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody conical to flattened hemispherical capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus decipiens was first formally described in 1837 by the botanist Stephan Endlicher from a specimen collected near King Georges Sound by Charles von Hügel. The description was published in the book Enumeratio plantarum quas in Novae Hollandiae ora austro-occidentali ad fluvium Cygnorum et in sinu Regis Georgii collegit Carolus Liber Baro de Hügel. The specific epithet (decipiens) is derived from the Latin word decipio meaning \\"to beguile\\" or \\"to cheat\\" but the reason Endlicher gave this name is not clear, but may refer to its similarity to another species. Subspecies, including E. decipiens subsp. chalara Brooker & Hopper have been described but the names have not been accepted by the Australian Plant Census. Distribution and habitat Redheart is found on sandplains, hills and along the edges of swamps in the Wheatbelt, South West and Great Southern regions of Western Australia growing in clay, loam or sandy soils over laterite.

Because most of this trade was with England, the leading citizens of Nantucket chose to be neutral during the American Revolutionary War, siding neither with those who supported revolution nor with the British Crown, in order to maintain the viability of the island's economy. The Quaker culture of pacifism was a secondary cause of the island's non-participation in revolutionary activities.  Background  Whaling in the early colonial era Nantucket is an island located 14 miles (20 km) south of Cape Cod in the State of Massachusetts. When the British explorer Bartholomew Gosnold first sighted Nantucket in 1602 on his way to the New World, it was already home to some 3,000 indigenous Native Americans who were living there. The island was then ceded to British settler Thomas Mayhew in 1641. Upon receiving this land, Mayhew kept 1/10th for himself, and sold the remaining land to British settlers living in Salisbury for \\"thirty pounds…and also two beaver hats, one for myself, and one for my wife.\\" The island's whaling industry figures in the history of colonial America.  Whaling  The Nantucket Historical Association notes that inhabitants of the island may have seen right whales washing ashore on their beaches as early as the 1690s, and it is confirmed that by 1715, Nantucketers realized that there were sperm whales in those waters as well. = Demand for oils = There was high demand for quality oils within the colonies and in Europe, but particularly in London, which was by far the most industrialized European city at the time. London had experienced the effects of industrialization during the beginning of the century, and they experienced both the good and the bad of the urbanization and modernization that came with it. A rise in crime rates in London was blamed in part on the city's widespread lack of street lights, which soon became chief among the concerns and prompted the creation of a program to counteract that issue in 1736. Sperm oils and their lubricant byproducts were sought after, as they was odorless, gave the \\"clearest and brightest flame,\\" and were of comparable price with vegetable oils. = Development of whaling and related industries = Various ancillary industries on Nantucket such as shipbuilding and spermaceti processing also emerged to support the growth of this new burgeoning island economy. Recognizing their fortunate geographic location and in need of a good living, large numbers of these early settlers began to hunt sperm whales by the early 1700s. Herman Melville wrote in Moby Dick that \\"thus have these Nantucketers overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders.\\" By the time the American Revolution began in 1775, the island had become the premier whaling economy on the Eastern Seaboard and had developed into a crucial trade partner for the British Empire across the Atlantic.  Quaker population  William Rotch—Nantucket envoy to negotiate Nantucket's neutrality Inhabitants of early Nantucket were largely drawn to the island from the surrounding rural areas of New England, even though until 1692 the lands were still part Dukes Country in New York State. Due to the island's Wampanoag origin, it developed a liberal and accepting social culture, which prompted a large influx of Quakers who were seeking to escape religious persecution from the British. Known collectively as the Society of Friends, these Quakers became some of Nantucket's most influential founding families and more often than not brought their cultural majority to bear in local politics.  Prominent individuals  William Rotch and Timothy Folger were influential in negotiating the outcome of Nantucket's trading prospects. = William Rotch = Of all the individuals on Nantucket during the situation in 1775, few had more influence on local affairs than William Rotch (1734-1828). Rotch was born on the island in 1734, and had inherited considerable wealth from his father. This inheritance, which Rotch split with his brother Francis, included two major shipping vessels, the Bedford and the Dartmouth - the latter is famous for being the ship from which a considerable wealth of tea was flung during the Boston Tea Party in 1773. = Timothy Folger = Timothy Folger was a prominent businessman on Nantucket during the Revolutionary War period and was the member of one of Massachusetts' most successful early American families. He was a successful business man, a captain, and a member of the groups that were sent to New York City and Philadelphia to discuss neutrality during the war. Folger was a three-time representative to both Massachusetts and New York from 1779-1782.  Contemporary observations  French explorer St. John de Crevecoeur, who visited Nantucket in the early 1770s and mentioned it repeatedly in his 1782 book Letters to an American Farmer, writing of the economic success that \\"what has happened here has and will happen everywhere else.\\" It is also referenced in Thomas Jefferson's 1788 book Observations on the Whale-Fishery, which he wrote as Minister to France following the conclusion of the Revolutionary War in 1783, and which describes in detail the success of \\"Nantuckois\\" in the service of Britain's whaling industry during the decades after the war.  Prelude to revolution  In 1775, Nantucket was an important part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which was a locus of revolutionary sentiment. The colony had been governed by a form of colonial martial law for many months. Nantucket lacked military defenses and was isolated from the Massachusetts mainland. If the islanders proclaimed loyalty to either the Crown or to the colony, the other side could have easily occupied the island. British acts of Parliament, the importance of the island's trade with Britain, and the tendency of influential Quakers towards pacifism set the stage for neutrality between the colony and the mother country.  Acts of Parliament  Historian, Nathaniel Philbrick, wrote that \\"during the winter and spring of 1775, as Britain and her colonies teetered on the brink of war, Nantucket Island was mentioned repeatedly in the halls of Parliament,\\" highlighting that Britain valued Nantucket's whaling exports at a time when factions were deciding whether to revolt against Britain. The British Parliament had enacted measures, including the Massachusetts Bay Restraining Bill of 1774, that prohibited trade out of Boston and banned the use of fisheries on the East Coast and in Newfoundland, but exempted Nantucket. At the time, half of Massachusetts' total whaling vessels contained half of the seamen manning those vessels were based in Nantucket and had the production capacity to collect and churn out over 30,000 barrels of oil in a single calendar year. Siding with the colonists against the Crown would have invited Nantucket's inclusion in the punitive acts of Parliament and destroyed the island's fisheries.  The importance of trade  Since the island's economy depended on the oil trade with London, it was important to maintain that connection. The success of the island's commercial ventures, including \\"merchants, blacksmiths, coopers, boat-builders, riggers, sailmakers, oil and candle manufacturers, carpenters, seamen, and similar intertwining occupations\\" was primarily based on trans-Atlantic trade. British merchants recognized the importance of this trade and acted quickly to protect it. Quaker sympathizer and Scottish merchant, Robert Barclay, testified before Parliament as early as 1774 that Nantucket's supply of spermaceti oil was crucial for London's economy, and that neutrality might allow trade with the island to bypass the rebellious factions in Boston and be conducted directly with England.  Quaker pacifism  In addition to economic factors, the pacifistic culture of Quakerism factored into Nantucket's decision to adopt a policy of neutrality. The Society of Friends on Nantucket included the Macys, Coffins, Gardners, and Starbucks. It presided over local politics with a pacific character, and \\"entertained a strong and almost universal opinion that wars are wrong.\\" Historians have cited Quaker beliefs as being, \\"a powerful factor in their non-partisanship or neutrality was the spirit of non- resistance\\", noting that their \\"well-known aversion to war has proved a far better shield to them than fleets and fortifications could have been,\\" as they were \\"exposed on all sides, without a single fort, arsenal, or military company.\\"  Outbreak of revolution  By the summer of 1775, Nantucket was feeling pressure from both the colonies and British Empire. On July 7, 1775, the Provincial Congress in Philadelphia passed a clear statement to cease trade with the British, a resolution stating \\"that no provisions or necessaries of any kind be exported from any part of this colony to the Island of Nantucket until the inhabitants of said Island shall have given full and sufficient satisfaction to this Congress, or some future House of Representatives, that the provisions they have now by them, has not been and shall not be expended in foreign, but for domestic production.\\" The selectmen of Nantucket defended their commitment to not participating in rebellion—on moral and cultural grounds—in a letter to the Board of Massachusetts on July 14, 1775. It explained that \\"the inhabitants [of Nantucket] are the greater part, of the people call'd Quakers, whose well known principles of Religion, will not admit of their taking up arms in a military way in any case whatever.\\" The wealth and prosperity that the whaling trade had afforded the island's most prominent merchants and traders was an unspoken factor. One historian noted that, \\"When the sting came during and following the war, the Nantucket oil magnates demonstrated how little their attachment to a new nation or affection for their island home counted against prospective gain from hunting and processing the whale.\\" These factors formed the basis for favoring neither the British nor the revolutionaries during the time of conflict.  Neutrality  By 1776, although the leading citizens of Nantucket had demonstrated their commitment to neutrality in both their actions and their written responses to the Provincial Congress, both sides of the war exerted some pressure to favor them. After some prominent Quaker families moved to the mainland with the onset of hostilities and with them the cordial relations with the English, regarding the whale-oil trade. Nantucket sent a committee of Benjamin Tucker, Timothy Folger, William Rotch, and Samuel Starbuck was immediately sent to Newport, Rhode Island and New York City to parlay with British commanders so that trade could continue unmolested. The resulting agreement held that \\"the depredations would cease, provided the Town of Nantucket would observe strict neutrality\\". In December 1778, when a British schooner wrecked on the Nantucket coastline, Timothy Folger outfitted the shipwrecked British forces with small vessels and provisions in order to get them safely to New York. The British also cooperated with islanders during this time, when, in April 1779, loyalists forces came to Nantucket with orders not to harm or uproot local citizens, but to \\"destroy rebel property wherever it be found.\\" Nantucket's continued trade with the British after the islanders' declaration of neutrality created questions of divided loyalty from the authorities in Massachusetts. As a result, on September 25, 1782 Nantucket convened a town meeting and drafted a letter to the Court of Massachusetts, which explained the islanders' economic constraints and their desire to remain neutral during the war. Frederick Folger, the town clerk, signed the letter. The letter addressed rumors that Nantucket had continued to trade secretly with New York City. In the following weeks, William Rotch and Samuel Starbuck were sent as envoys to Philadelphia, where in the winter of 1782 an official Agreement of Neutrality was drafted, signed, and made law. As one scholar noted, \\"Nantucket struggled through the war and experienced considerable prosperity after the proclamation of peace.\\"  References  * Category:American Revolutionary War Category:History of Massachusetts ","title":"Nantucket during the American Revolutionary War era"},{"id":"52168350","text":"Hamburg Messe is a business unit of Hamburg Messe und Congress GmbH.

Originally the fair ground was bound to the area between St. Petersburger Straße, Karolinenstraße und Holstenglacis / Bei den Kirchhöfen and consisted of the halls 1 to 12. It was then extended west across Karolinenstraße with another four halls (A1 to A4). The original halls 9 to 12 became B1 to B4 and halls 1 to 8 were replaced with the new halls B5 to B7. The original hall 8 was 24 meters in height and had complete glass walls, making this hall particularly useful for large exhibits like full hot air balloons. It was also used for some concerts.  Events and exhibitions  The well known and regular events hosted on the premises of the Hamburg Messe include among others: * Aircraft Interiors Expo – International convention for aircraft interiors (operated by Reed Exhibitions in co-operation with Hamburg Messe und Congress) * HansePferd Hamburg – International exhibition for riders and horse owners * Internorga – International trade show for foodservice and hospitality * SMM – The leading international maritime trade fair * MS&D; – International conference on maritime security and defence * Reisen Hamburg – Expo for travel, caravaning, outdoor and biking * WindEnergy Hamburg – On- and offshore wind energy expo (in co-operation with Messe Husum & Congress) * Coteca – International trade show for the coffee, tea and cocoa industries * Seatrade Europe – Cruise and Rivercruise Convention  References  External links * Hamburg Messe * Congress Center Hamburg Category:Trade fairs in Germany Category:Hamburg ","title":"Hamburg Messe"},{"id":"52168376","title":"Maurizio Bonuglia"},{"id":"52168382","text":"The Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium is an American football stadium in Brookings, South Dakota, United States, on the campus of South Dakota State University. It is the home venue of the South Dakota State Jackrabbits football team. The stadium, which was constructed in phases on the previous Coughlin-Alumni Stadium site, seats 19,340 spectators. The stadium was funded through private gifts and long-term revenue streams, including expanded club seats, loge boxes, and a premium suite level. Lead gifts totaling $12.5 million from Sioux Falls banker Dana Dykhouse and philanthropist T. Denny Sanford were announced in October 2013. The stadium opened in 2016. The stadium project was approved by the state Legislature during the 2014 session and signed into law by Governor Dennis Daugaard. Construction began in the fall of 2014 with the east and south stands completed in August 2015. The remainder of the project was finished by the next football season in August 2016. Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium replaced old Coughlin–Alumni Stadium.  History  The first event opening the stadium was the Jacks Bash concert which featured country music artists Lee Brice, Little Big Town, and Luke Bryan on September 8, 2016.

It is a common and widespread orchid distinguished by its red-striped labellum, and petals and lateral which are pressed against the ovary. Description Caladenia cairnsiana is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which is usually found in scattered groups or sometimes in clumps of more than ten. It has a single hairy leaf, long and about wide. There are one or two flowers on the end of a stalk tall, each flower long and about wide. The flowers are greenish-yellow with red markings. The lateral sepals and the petals hang down against the ovary. The labellum is inclined upwards, is red- striped, has a smooth edge and a glandular tip. In the centre of the labellum is a band of deep purple-red calli. Flowering occurs between August and early November and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia cairnsiana was first described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1868 in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from specimens collected in the Stirling Range. The specific epithet (cairnsiana) honours Reverend Adam Cairns. Distribution and habitat The zebra orchid is widespread and common, between Esperance and Lancelin in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. It grows in sand, laterite or loam in forest, woodland and heath.

He was the founder of the company Sandvikens Jernverks AB (now called Sandvik AB) and was the first person to implement the Bessemer process successfully on an industrial scale and pioneered ingot steel in the Swedish iron and steel industry.  Early life  Göran Fredrik Göransson was born on 20 January 1819 in Gävle, Sweden, to Maria Catharina Elfstrand and Anders Petter Göransson. He was the oldest son in the family of three girls and four boys. He went to school in Gävle and also spent 18 months in Germany, France, England and the United States in order to acquire experience in conducting international business.  Career  In 1841, Göransson became a partner in the firm Daniel Elfstrand & Co., his family business, and its director in 1856. In 1856, the company also acquired the iron-works in Högbo along with the Edske blast furnace. He traveled to England in 1857 to acquire a steam engine for the Edske furnace but after a change in business plans, bought one-fifth of Henry Bessemer's patent for the production of steel from pig-iron. He managed to convince the initially skeptical English of the excellence of the Bessemer process and his support was instrumental to the international spread of the method. Upon his return, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences gave him a sum of 50,000 Swedish crowns for financing steel production using the Bessemer process. The Bessemer method involved blasting a strong current of air through molten iron to burn off the carbon and other impurities. However, it proved difficult to keep the temperature high enough throughout the process. After initial difficulties, Göransson successfully managed to produce steel on an industrial scale using the new process on 18 July 1858. He founded the firm Högbo Stål & Jernwerks AB on 31 January 1862 in Sandviken, Sweden and presented the now commercially viable Bessemer process at the International Exhibition in London. However, Göransson and the company entered into receivership in 1866 due to bad capital resources. In 1868, the company was acquired and reconstructed into Sandvikens Jernverks AB with his eldest son, Anders Henrik Göransson as managing director and Per Murén as chairman. The firm was able to quickly expand in large foreign industrial markets such as Germany, Great Britain and the United States mainly due to Göransson's extensive connections abroad, cultivated during his time as general manager in Elfstrand & Co. Göransson would succeed Murén as the company's chairman in 1883.  Personal life and legacy  Göransson married Catharina Elisabeth Sehlberg on 31 May 1842. They had four sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Anders Henrik, would become managing director of Sandvikens Jernverks AB and would later succeed his father as chairman after his death. He is responsible for the founding of Sandviken in 1862, which grew from a small fishing community on the bay of the Storsjön lake to a thriving town around the steelworks that he had established, and where most residents worked or owed their livelihoods to the company.

Names for this tank includes Kaplan MT (Turkey), Harimau / Tiger (Indonesia). History The governments of Indonesia and Turkey first agreed in May 2015 to jointly develop the MMWT for the Indonesian Army at a reported cost of 30 million US dollars. The development phase of the program was expected to take up to 37 months, with the first prototype being built in Turkey, and the second in Indonesia. The intellectual property of the design was agreed upon to be shared between the two governments. On 1 November 2016, during the 2016 Indo Defence expo, the first model of the tank was unveiled, along with some technical specifications. Most notably, the vehicles overall weight was reported to be around 35 tonnes, and the main armament would be provided by a Belgian-made turret developed by CMI Defence featuring a 105mm rifled barrel, capable of firing a wide range of projectiles. On 9 May 2017 at the IDEF 2017 expo, the first prototype of the tank was revealed. The tank can be fitted with either a Cockerill XC-8 105mm concept turret or Cockerill 3105 modular turret. Additionally, the tank utilizes modular armor, allowing for quick replacement upon damage. On 5 September 2018, the general manager of FNSS told Turkey's Anadolu Agency that the tank had passed months of required qualification tests for the Indonesian Army, and was ready for mass production. He stated that the first batch of 20 to 25 tanks could be ordered as early as late 2018, and that the full number of tanks to be produced would likely fall between 200 and 400. On 7 February 2020, it was announced that mass production of the MMWT has started.https://www.armyrecognition.com/february_2020_global_defense_security_army_news_industry/tukish- indonesian_kaplan-harimau_medium_tank_now_in_mass_production.html  Design = Armament  The MMWT is equipped with a Cockerill CT-CV 105HP (High Pressure) 105mm rifled gun manufactured by CMI (Cockerill Maintenance & Ingenierie SA Defense), with the barrel mounting a bore evacuator and thermal jacket. The turret is equipped with an autoloader and can be rotated 360 degrees both electronically and mechanically, with a maximum elevation/depression of 42 up to -6 degrees, and it's equipped with Gyro Stabilizer and Firing Control System. It's also equipped with an IFF system, Hunter Killer System for target selection, and Auto Target Locking System to assist the Gunner. The Gun has been test fired with TPCSDS-T, HEP-T, HE4 TP2 shells, and can also fire NATO standard 105mm Shells such as: * M1060CV  Velocity 1620 m/s with RHA Penetration 560mm from 2000m at 60 degrees * M1061 HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank)  Velocity 1173 m/s RHA Penetration >400mm from 1500m at 60 degrees * M393 A3 HESH (High Explosive Squash Head)  Velocity 732 m/s * M416 Smoke  Velocity 731 m/s * M1204 Canister  Velocity 1173 m/s  Armor  The hull armor of MMWT is using modular armor. It is categorized as STANAG 4569 level 4 protection, which means the tank can withstand 14.5×114mm AP rounds at 200 meters with 911 m/s velocity. The underbelly of the tank uses V-hull, able to withstand 10 kg AT mine under the tracks and under the center. Due to modularity, the armor can be augmented to level 5 protection (withstand 25 mm APDS-T at 500 m with 1258 m/s velocity) without increasing the volume of the tank, with the frontal arc able to withstand 30 mm rounds.  Mobility  Dynamic and mobility test taken in 7–16 August 2018 to prove the specification design. The tank uses a Caterpillar C13 diesel engine generating 711 HP, coupled with Allison/Caterpillar X300 transmission. During the test the tank is able to reach 78 km/h in road speed. The prototype is able to cross 2 m trench and 0.9 m vertical obstacle.  Defensive Systems  The MMWT's survivability has been further strengthened. A modular PULAT Active Protection System joint- developed by ASELSAN and TÜBİTAK SAGE can be integrated. This ensures the tank's defensive capabilities against projectiles at all-angles.

One priest was a Brazilian Jesuit missionary, while the other priest was an evangelizer himself. The others were all lay Catholics, most of them anonymous members of the Church, some of them children. The 30 individuals were beatified in Saint Peter's Square on 5 March 2000. Pope Francis – on 23 March 2017 – signed a decree that approved their canonization while waiving the miracle required for sainthood; the date was formalized at a gathering of cardinals on 20 April and the group was canonized as saints on 15 October 2017. Lives and murders=Background The Natal region was colonized after the Portuguese Catholics arrived but the Dutch Calvinists soon took over and spread their anti-Catholic sentiment across the region, while making persecution of all remaining Catholics an objective for them. Despite the air of persecution some priests moved to the area in order to sustain the people in their faith. André de Soveral André de Soveral was born in Brazil in 1572. He was a professed member of the Society of Jesus, having entered the Jesuits in 1593 and making his period of novitiate in Bahia. He studied Latin – as well as the native language – and theological studies before being sent to the college in Olinda. His first experience in the missions was in Rio Grande do Norte in 1606 amongst the natives, for catechism lessons. In 1614 he was a parish priest in Cunhaú. On 16 July 1645 – a Sunday – there were 69 people gathered in the chapel of Our Lady of the Candles for a Mass that Soveral presided over. It was just before the Eucharistic rite that Dutch soldiers attacked the chapel and murdered Soveral and a companion – Domingos Carvalho – along with others. October massacre On 3 October 1645 a total of 200 armed natives with their Dutch allies targeted and hacked to death 30 individuals including children and one priest. The leader of this group was the radical Calvinist Antonio Paraopaba. Mateus Moreira – a victim of the onslaught – cried out as he died: \\"Praise be the Blessed Sacrament\\". Individuals Monument dedicated to the martyrs. The 2 individuals killed on 16 July 1645 are: * André de Soveral (b. 1572) – Jesuit priestJesuit André de Soveral Among New Saints Canonized by Pope Francis from Jesuits.org, retrieved 24 October 2017 * Domingos Carvalho – layman The 28 individuals killed on 3 October 1645 are: * Ambrósio Francisco Ferro – priest * Antônio Vilela – married layman * A daughter of Vilela – young laywoman * José do Porto – layman * Francisco de Bastos – layman * Diogo Pereira – layman * João Lostau Navarro – layman * Antônio Vilela Cid – layman * Estêvão Machado de Miranda – married layman * A daughter of de Miranda – young laywoman * A daughter of de Miranda – young laywoman * Vicente de Souza Pereira – layman * Francisco Mendes Pereira – layman * João da Silveira – layman * Simão Correia – layman * Antônio Baracho – layman * Mateus Moreira – layman * João Martins – layman * 7 lay companions of Martins * Manuel Rodrigues de Moura – married layman * The wife of Moura – married laywoman * A daughter of Francisco Dias – laywoman Canonization The beatification process opened in Natal on 6 June 1989 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" and titled them all as Servants of God. The diocesan process spanned from 1989 until 1994 and the C.C.S. later validated this process on 25 November 1994 before receiving the Positio in 1998. The theologians approved the cause on 23 June 1998 as did the C.C.S. on 10 November 1998. Pope John Paul II confirmed that the group were all killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hated of the faith) and thus approved their beatifications. He presided over the beatification celebration in Saint Peter's Square on 5 March 2000. Pope Francis had expressed in the past his closeness to this particular cause and expressed willingness to canonize them as saints. The C.C.S. met on 14 March 2017 to discuss the omission of the miracle needed for canonization and voiced their approval of that. The pope approved the canonization on 23 March 2017 in an official decree with the date formalized at a gathering of cardinals on 20 April; the group was canonized in Saint Peter's Square on 15 October 2017. The postulator for this cause at the time of the canonization was Fra Giovangiuseppe Califano.

The three structures are: * Upton Road Bridge, the last known surviving metal truss highway bridge in Michigan built by Detroit Bridge & Iron Works, and one of only three remaining Parker truss bridges in Michigan. * Elsie Mill Pond Dam, a rock and earth-filled dam with a concrete cap and spillway. * Kellogg Bros. & Johnson Mill Site (designated archaeological site 20CL144), the foundation and associated remains of the 1865 Kellogg Bros. & Johnson grist mill. The structures were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. History Duplain Township was first settled in the 1830s. In about 1845, Robert E. Craven (likely with his brothers Joseph and Thomas) constructed a saw-mill at this site. The saw mill operated for nearly 20 years. In 1865, Kellogg Bros. and Johnson purchased the site from Craven's estate and replaced the sawmill with a larger grist/flour mill, and built a timber dam to help power operations at the mill. Around the same time, a bridge was constructed crossing the Maple River a few hundred feet from the location of the current bridge, at the time carrying Upton Road over the Maple River. The grist mill operated for a number of years, going through multiple owners. In 1901, Duplain Township voted to allocate money to replace the Upton Road bridge. The Detroit Bridge & Iron Works was contracted to build the steel superstructure of the bridge for $2,590. With planking, abutments, and labor, the total cost of the bridge was $3,228.57. In 1912, the current earth-and-concrete Elsie Mill Pond dam was constructed, replacing the 1865 timber version. The mill continued operating until 1950. In 1953, the building was remodeled and reopened as a feed and grain elevator. In 1966, a new Maple River crossing on Island Road was constructed, and the Upton Road bridge was closed to traffic. The mill burned in 1969, leaving only the foundation remnants seen today. In 1976, Duplain Township, with the assistance of the Elsie Lions Club, turned the area into a park. Description The Grist Mill site is located on the Maple River. The Upton Road Bridge spans the river, approximately sixty feet west of the dam. The mill site is located directly on the southern bank of the river, about 75 feet east of the dam. Duplain Township owns the site and maintains it as a park. Upton Road Bridge The Upton Road bridge is a single-span steel Parker truss bridge with pinned connections, sitting on concrete abutments. It spans 160 feet and is 16 feet wide. The deck consists of wooden planks laid atop the steel stingers, with wooden paving blocks on top, and a final layer of asphalt. Grist Mill Dam The Grist Mill Dam is approximately 150 feet long and twelve to fifteen feet high. The main body of the dam is constructed from rock and earth-fill, and a concrete cap and spillway is placed on top. The spillway spans the entirety of the dam, and empties onto a nearly flat concrete apron five to seven feet in wide, and then onto a lower spillway. Concrete abutments are built at each end of the dam. Kellogg Bros. & Johnson Grist Mill Site The site of the former grist mill contains a rubble fieldstone retaining wall, along with foundation walls of the mill and millrace. The mill foundation is in an L-shape, with walls 75 to 85 feet long on the longer side, and twenty feet in the shorter. The walls range up to 15 feet in height. There is also evidence of two flumes running from the mill pond to the mill.

He served as a Liberal MP for South Staffordshire from 1857 until 1868.  Biography  William Orme Foster was born in 1814, the son of William Foster of Wordsley House in Stourbridge and his wife Charlotte daughter of William Orme of Dulwich, Surrey. William Foster had an iron business in Stourbridge (he formed a partnership with his brother-in-law and traded as Foster and Orme) but it was as heir to his uncle, James Foster that William Orme Foster was to achieve great wealth and a prominent position as an ironmaster in the Midlands region of England. William Orme Foster attended Shrewsbury School between 1826 and 1829. William Orme Foster was employed as an agent by his uncle before 1850. In 1852, he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for Worcestershire. On James Foster's death in 1853, Foster inherited the bulk of his estate which was valued at £700,0000. The inheritance included mines, ironworks, furnaces and engineering works situated at Stourbridge, Shropshire and the Black Country region of England. The growth of his business was stimulated by the booming railways industry, rails and other equipment being a major product of his works. In 1855, Foster bought the second version of Constable's painting The Lock for £860. From 1857 until 1868 William Orme Foster served as a Member of Parliament for South Staffordshire. He was elected unopposed for this two-member constituency in 1857, 1859 and 1865. However, after boundary changes, he contested West Staffordshire in 1868, coming only third in the poll for the two-member constituency. In 1867, he was described as: \\"a Liberal; opposed to the ballot but in favour of a \\"large and comprehensive measure\\" of Parliamentary reform. Other public offices held by Foster included High Sheriff for the County of Wexford in 1876, and High Sheriff for the County of Shropshire in 1883. In 1873 he served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury. In 1867 W.O. Foster bought the Apley Park estate near Bridgnorth in Shropshire, from Douglas Whitmore for over £300,000. The estate included most of Bridgnorth town. In 1873 as landowner he held in England 8,457 acres in Shropshire, 1,917 acres in Worcestershire and 874 acres in Staffordshire, besides 9,724 acres in County Wexford in Ireland.Victorian Library reprint, 1971 William Orme Foster was buried at St Chad's Church, Stockton Under W.O Foster the industrial enterprises such as John Bradley & Co, inherited from his uncle, continued to prosper, the 1860s being particularly good years. John Bradley & Co became one of the largest iron manufacturers in the Midlands, producing wrought iron by the traditional puddling process. However, soon after his loss at the West Staffordshire election of 1868, Foster suffered a \\"paralytic seizure\\" which weakened his health and, for many years, he left business affairs with his wife and with his eldest son. From the 1870s onwards, profits from the business declined as steel manufacturers competed with wrought iron producers and the final decades of the century brought a gradual contraction of iron output. In 1884, Foster attempted unsuccessfully to sell John Bradley & Co. In the same year, W.O. Foster donated the early steam locomotive Agenoria, which had once served his ironworks and mines at Shut End, to the Science Museum (London). In 1843 W.O. Foster married Isabella (died 1910), daughter of Henry Grazebrook of Liverpool, by whom he had two sons (William and James) and four daughters (Charlotte, Constance, Isabella and Julia). It was through one of the latter, Julia Mary (1860-1931), who married as her first husband Hugh Tyrwhitt, that he became grandfather of the composer Lord Berners.Article on Lord Berners by Mark Amory, who wrongly titles William Orme Foster 'Sir' though latter was never knighted or became a baronet. William Orme Foster died at Apley Hall on 29 September 1899, aged 84, and was buried on 5 October at Stockton. His estate was probated at £2,588,000, and he left his fortune to his son William Henry Foster.

Maurism (Maurismo in Spanish) was a conservative political movement that bloomed in Spain from 1913 around the political figure of Antonio Maura after a schism in the Conservative Party between idóneos ('apt ones') and mauristas ('maurists'). Its development took place in a period of crisis for the dynastic parties of the Spanish Restoration regime. The movement, which fragmented in several factions in the 1920s, has been portrayed as a precursor of the Spanish radical right.  History  The 1913 refusal by Antonio Maura to accept the terms of the turno pacífico (the alternation in government between the two major parties in the Restoration two-party system) and assume the presidency of the Council of Ministers led to a schism in the Conservative Party between idóneos (supporters of Eduardo Dato and dynastic normality) and the followers of Maura, leading to the establishment of a new movement, maurismo. In October 1913 a seminal speech by Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo delivered in Zaragoza gave birth to the so-called maurismo callejero ('street Maurism'). This side of Maurism became active in street politics using popular agitation, even physical violence. Anís Maura\\", promoted by the Maurist Youth. Maurism, aside from the figure of Antonio Maura, was partially inspired by historian Gabriel Maura (son of Antonio Maura), and received some influences from the ideas of French monarchist Charles Maurras—Maura and Maurras wrote to each other—and Action Française. However, Antonio Maura never got to lend support to the radical side of the movement created around him. Other notable Mauristas were José Calvo Sotelo, José Félix de Lequerica, Fernando Suárez de Tangil and César Silió. Miguel Ángel Perfecto identified three inner factions within the movement: the social Catholic one of Ossorio, the liberal-conservative strand of Gabriel Maura and the neoconservatives of Goicoechea. Additionally, the followers of Juan de la Cierva within the Conservative Party, as they drifted away from the orthodoxy of Eduardo Dato, ended up orbiting around authoritarian stances close to Maurism, but they did not merge into the organizational structure. Conference by Gabriel Maura organised by the Maurist Youth in the Westin Palace Hotel (March 1917). The social strata prevalent among mauristas, whose first National Assembly was held in January 1913, were young people from the aristocracy and the wealthy middle classes. The movement built up its own organic structure and related media, created Maurist circles and even worker associations and presented candidates for local and general elections. Maurists were noted for the wide dissemination of their propaganda, embracing the catch-phrase \\"¡Maura Sí!\\" ('Yes to Maura!'). Attempts were made to reach capture working class support but these did not succeed as it was perceived as too middle class and establishment-minded, with republican groups managing to mobilise the workers much more successfully. Presenting itself as an antithetical to the Restoration regime instituted by Antonio Cánovas del Castillo (canovismo), Maurism tried to lead a conservative modernization, endorsing an interventionist, nationalist and corporative ideological project. It has been characterised as a regenerationist movement. It shared with that movement the belief that defeat in the Spanish–American War had been the fault of a political system that was rife with incompetence and corruption, with Maurism prescribing the imposition of a new patriotic system from above by elites. Another feature of Maurism was confessional Catholicism. The movement's social action could be described as paternalist, with a tutelary function of the upper classes over the lower ones. During World War I, Maurists largely supported Germanophile stances, although Maura himself defended neutrality and Ossorio endorsed Germanophobia. Maurist meeting in the Teatro de la Comedia, Madrid (March 1917). In the 1917 Madrid local elections nine Maurist councillors were elected. At this election non-dynastic unconventional candidates (Maurists and the republican-socialist coalition) took marginally more seats than the candidates elected by the traditional Restoration parties. The 1919 Maura cabinet, that included three Maurists, Goicoechea, Silió and Ossorio, was a window of opportunity for Maurism but it ended up in failure. Maura had become aware of the difficulties in fulfilling the Maurist agenda without the support of the dynastic forces. Since then the movement shifted towards fragmentation. In the 1920 election to the Cortes the Maurist fraction only got 22 members of the parliament. Two \\"antagonistic\\" factions split from Maurism. In one side the scion led by Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo, supportive of social Catholicism and Christian democracy, founded the Partido Social Popular in 1922. On the other side Antonio Goicoechea led an anti-liberal and authoritarian scion, vouching for an \\"organic democracy\\", concept later advanced by Francoism. In 1922 the Maurists around Manuel Delgado Barreto and the journal La Acción looked to Italian Fascism. Goicoechea insisted on a proclaimed popular support in Spain for the rise of \\"a Mussolini\\" in the country. The very vagueness that underpinned Maurism, which insisted on a \\"revolution from above\\" but left the interpretation of this vague concept up to individual adherents, has been characterised as encouraging this factionalism and preventing it from fully emerging as a coherent ideology. For his part Maura never addressed these issues, preferring to remain an aloof figurehead rather than seeking to lead an organised political movement. Maurists such as José Calvo Sotelo and Goicoechea gave support after the September 1923 Primo de Rivera coup d'etat to the dictatorship of the later — whose coming was cheered by the overwhelming majority of the Maurists — and they would finally participate in Renovación Española ('Spanish Renovation') during the Second Republic. José Luis Rodríguez Jiménez notes that Maurism added at some point the \\"Neither Right Nor Left\\" rhetoric, identified by the author as a feature of a drift from liberal conservatism towards authoritarian conservatism.

The perpetrator in both shootings, identified as 46-year-old Scott Michael Greene of Urbandale, Iowa, was apprehended by police hours later. Greene pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life without parole on May 20, 2017. Background and events According to a report released in 2016 by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 50 U.S. police officers were killed by homicide as of late July, representing a significant increase from the 33 officers murdered in 2015. The report also noted an increase of \\"ambush killings\\" targeting officers, with fourteen incidents recorded. Also in July 2016, there had been two mass shootings targeting police officers in Dallas, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in a ten-day period. Speaking for the Des Moines Police Department after the Des Moines-area shootings, Sergeant Paul Parizek noted, \\"There is a clear and present danger to police officers right now.\\" On November 2, 2016, Justin Martin, an Urbandale police officer, was killed shortly after 1:00 a.m. in Urbandale, located about northwest of Des Moines. Officers responding to a 1:06 report of shots being fired found him dead in his car. About 20 minutes later, Sergeant Anthony Beminio, a Des Moines police officer, was found shot in his vehicle at a nearby intersection, about from the first scene. Beminio was taken to the Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died, according to Sergeant Parizek. Security footage of Beminio's death, time-stamped at about 1:09, depicted him being fired upon by a man who had driven a truck beside Beminio's vehicle. Victims The two slain officers were identified as: *Officer Justin Martin, 24, who had been with the department since 2015. He was believed to be the first officer of the Urbandale Police Department to be killed in the line of duty. *Sergeant Anthony Beminio, 39, who had been with the department since 2005. He was the third officer of the Des Moines Police Department to be killed in the line of duty in 2016, following the March deaths of two officers in a head-on collision with an intoxicated driver on Interstate 80, and also the first officer to die from a homicide since 1977. Perpetrator Scott Michael Greene, 46, was identified by police as the sole suspect in both shootings through \\"a series of leads and investigative tips\\", including a vehicle description provided by a witness. He was a resident of Urbandale. Less than two hours after his identification, the Dallas County Sheriff's Office and the Iowa State Patrol apprehended Greene at 9:15 a.m. According to police, he was found walking unarmed down G Trail at 320th Way, a gravel road in Wiscotta, located south of Redfield and some west of the shootings. He had flagged down an Iowa Department of Natural Resources officer and asked him to call 9-1-1. He was transported to a hospital after he complained of a preexisting health problem. Personal life Greene had three children from two relationships and was an employee at a furniture store from June 2006 to August 2013. Also, for three separate times in recent years, he had been a part-time worker at two local Ace Hardware stores. In October 2016, he was hired by a small construction business in Ankeny that specialized in fences, even though he had no experience building fences. He had told the company that he \\"was pretty desperate\\" for a job and that he needed to support his teenage daughter. The company sent him home after three days \\"because he was not taking directions and wasn't working\\", and though it gave him the chance to return to work under a different crew, Greene quit instead. Afterwards, he posted a video on YouTube of a worker driving a truck, and claimed, in a written message below the video, that the company fired him after he reported unsafe driving. Neighbors described Greene as a depressed loner and said that he had been going through several personal hardships, including the death of his father, the departure of his wife, and his separation from his children. At the time of the shootings, he was living with his mother and daughter in the former's house, located near Urbandale High School. Earlier incidents Greene reportedly had a history of assault and confrontations with police. In April 2014, he was charged with interference with official acts after becoming aggressive and resisting an Urbandale officer's attempt to pat him down in search of weapons. Two days after this incident, he was charged with harassment after he reportedly threatened to kill a man and used a racial slur against him. Greene pleaded guilty in both cases, and was subsequently fined, given a year of probation and a restraining order against the man he threatened, and forced to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Greene's probation officer wrote that Greene had complied with the terms of his probation, as well as medication recommendations. Two weeks prior to the shootings, he had to be physically escorted by police out of Urbandale High School, where his daughter was a student. The incident occurred during a football game, when he waved a Confederate flag in front of black students during the national anthem, with the apparent intent to incite them into a physical confrontation with him. Some of the fans in the stands were participating in a non violent protest by sitting during the National Anthem. Nearby parents tried to ask Greene to leave, but he refused and continued waving the flag, prompting one parent to grab the flag and throw it onto the track. Officers intervened and tried to ask Greene to leave, but he again refused, arguing that his constitutional rights were being violated. He also tried to report the theft of the flag, as well as an assault on him during the game, but the reports were disregarded. Afterwards, he was temporarily banned from the school grounds until March 2017. Greene recorded the incident and posted the video on social media. In the video, a person identifying himself as Greene said that he was angry with people, especially blacks, sitting during the national anthem. He also sent an alarming email to school officials, in which he warned that \\"[they] messed with the wrong guy\\", that his civil rights were violated, and threatened legal action against the school. In addition, he stalked one of the involved black parents a week later after another game. Greene's behavior prompted school officials to consider increasing security at school events. Despite the aforementioned encounters, Greene's daughters described their father as having no anti-police ideology and expressed their shock at the shootings. In fact, Greene was reportedly disturbed with the anti-police violence that he felt was being shown by the black community. On October 29, four days before the shootings, he sent a note to the Urbandale Police Department in which he praised its officers for keeping the community safe, called them \\"absolute heroes\\", and apologized for his previous run-ins with law enforcement. In the same letter, he claimed he was getting treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. Around the same time as the football game incident, Greene had an argument with his mother, Patricia Greene, over a pit bull that was his daughter's service dog, which he brought home, and attempted to kick her out of the house by filing a restraining order and charging her with domestic assault. Patricia, in turn, filed a restraining order of her own to get him out of the house. On the day before the shootings, Patricia's restraining order, which ordered Greene to move out of the house and stay away from her for a year, was accepted and issued to Greene, who also had to return $10,000 to his mother. The domestic assault charge against Patricia Greene was dropped on November 3 due to insufficient evidence. Legal proceedings Following his release from the hospital on November 3, Greene was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. He faced a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the maximum allowed under Iowa law. He was held in the Polk County Jail, initially without bond; he was taken there in handcuffs belonging to the slain officers. Greene made his first court appearance on November 4, where his bond was set at $10 million. His next court appearance was scheduled on November 14, but Greene reportedly waived this hearing on November 9, and it was postponed to November 19. On May 20, 2017, Greene withdrew his not-guilty plea and pleaded guilty to two counts of first degree murder. That same day, Greene was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Aftermath The first shooting occurred on an intersection near Urbandale High School, resulting in the Urbandale Community School District canceling all classes and closing its facilities for the day. Classes resumed on the following day. The shootings also prompted the Des Moines Police Department to pair up its patrol officers for their own safety. Makeshift memorials were set up near the crime scenes. The funeral for Sergeant Anthony Beminio was held on November 7 at West Des Moines. The funeral for Officer Justin Martin was held on November 8 at his hometown of Rockwell City. On November 4, Urbandale hosted a vigil for Martin and Beminio, which was attended by over 2,500 people. This was followed by another vigil at the Des Moines Police Department station the next day, which was attended by more than 500 people. Investigation Between fifteen and thirty .223-caliber rounds were believed to have been fired at the Urbandale crime scene, while Beminio was believed to have been killed while responding to Martin's shooting. Investigators believed both officers were caught by surprise and did not interact with the gunman before being shot. The suspect's car and a high- powered rifle were recovered from a highly remote wooded area during a search by the ATF. The rifle was said to have been so well hidden that no human would have discovered the weapon; the weapon was in fact first discovered by a search dog. The suspect was believed to have used the firearm to shoot Martin and Beminio. Officers from the Des Moines, Urbandale, Ames, and Iowa State University Police Departments were involved in the investigation and manhunt. Reactions President Barack Obama praised Officer Justin Martin and Sergeant Anthony Beminio, and their dedication to their jobs as police officers. He also condemned the shootings, calling them \\"shameful acts of violence\\". Iowa Governor Terry Branstad and Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds released a joint statement in which they condemned the shootings and urged Iowa citizens to support law enforcement and the investigation. Attorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the shootings, saying that \\"violence has no place in the United States of America\\", and referenced the distrust between law enforcement and several communities nationwide. On November 4, two days after the shootings, Governor Branstad ordered U.S. and state flags to be lowered at half-mast in honor of the victims from early November 7 to late November 8.

The German legal philosopher, Otto von Gierke worked to develop a comprehensive history and theory of \\"social law\\" (Soziales Recht). Key tenets of Gierke's work were adopted and brought into English jurisprudence by Frederick W. Maitland. In France, Léon Duguit developed the concept of social law in his 1911 book, Le droit social, le droit individuel et la transformation de l’état.

Crew management services are an essential part of maritime and ship management that includes the management of all the various activities handled by crew on-board vessels, as well as related shore-based administration. Major locations where crew management activities are carried out from include Limassol (Cyprus), Singapore, Hong Kong and Malta. Crew management in the maritime/shipping industry - regular crew inspections Crew manager Crew management - captain at sea Mooring station - crew training at United Marine Training Center in Manila Kherson Maritime Specialized Training Centre (KMSTC) in Ukraine Full mission bridge simulator - crew training at UMTC in the Philippines Organisations that provide crew management services are known as crew management companies, or crewing managers, as commissioned by ship owners, ship managers, ship operators or charterers under a crew management contract. Crew management companies are responsible for the human resources and manning of all types of vessels, utilising their management offices, as well as a network of localised recruitment agencies based in key seafarer sourcing locations. Most commonly, these services include crew recruitment, deployment to vessel, scheduling, and regular training and development. Crew management companies are also responsible for taking care of on-going management and administrative duties of seafarers, such as payroll, travel arrangements, insurance and health schemes, overall career development, as well as their day-to-day welfare. Specialised crewing software, commonly custom-built by crew management companies is used to manage activities and crewing-related data. This includes the scheduling of crew on- and off-board vessels, industry certifications and documentation, crew logistical aspects in travel arrangement and payroll/HR, crew training and upgrading schedules, as well as office administration tasks, such as performance assessments and statistical analyses, feedback, management and ship-owner reporting and invoicing, client online interface, and an integrated CRM. Source of seafarers The majority of the international shipping industry's seafarer ratings are recruited from developing countries, especially the Far East and South East Asia, namely the Philippines (Filipino seamen), India and China. The OECD countries (North America, Western Europe, Japan etc.) remain an important source for officers, but growing numbers are now recruited from the Far East and Eastern Europe, with considerable numbers coming from Ukraine, Russia, Croatia and Latvia. Other major seafarer labour supply countries include Greece, Japan and the United Kingdom. Issues in crewing Human resources and the human element of crew management is of utmost importance to the sustainable development of maritime transportation, as well as in turn to global trade. The main issue impacting the global crew management sector and the wider shipping industry is an expected shortage of qualified seafarers over the coming years, especially for specialised vessels such as chemical, LNG and LPG carriers, engineering officers, and officers at management level. The latter two mainly due to not having enough new vacancies open up to allow new cadets to receive the required training at sea, coupled with current market volatility. Although the global supply of officers is forecast to increase steadily, it is predicted to be outpaced by increasing demand. This poses concerns for future shipping activity and the sustenance of maritime know-how; both on-board and ashore. These forecasted future global shortage in the supply of seafarers have been reported by many major industry bodies, such as Drewry and the BIMCO/ICS Manpower Report, although differing in actual numbers. Regardless of the accuracy of these estimates, a continuing worldwide shortage of officers is also confirmed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
