In 1900 Wood took his only five wicket haul, with figures of 6/51. From 1897 to 1902 Wood played in seven Europeans v Parsees matches. Wood took 34 wickets for the Europeans at a bowling average of 13.26, with best figures of 6-51. In the 1907 County Championship Wood represented Hampshire in a single first-class match against Yorkshire, where he made nine runs and was not required to bowl. In 1909 Wood played two final first-class matches for HDG Leveson-Gower's XI against Oxford University and Cambridge University. Wood later fought in the First World War with the West Yorkshire Regiment, during which Wood was decorated with Distinguished Service Order during the war and gained the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Their version was one of the top records of 1938, peaking at number two on US charts. History Bulee \\"Slim\\" Gaillard (1911‚Äì1991) and Leroy \\"Slam\\" Stewart (1914‚Äì1987) met in New York City in 1936 and formed a duo, performing together on the radio and in 52nd Street clubs, with Gaillard on guitar and vocals and Stewart on bass. They attracted radio pioneer Martin Block to manage them and he arranged a contract with Vocalion. On February 17, 1938 Slim and Slam recorded \\"Flat Foot Floogie\\" (Vocalion 4021). Gaillard sold the publishing rights to \\"Flat Foot Floogie\\" to Green Brothers and Knight for $250, and writing credit was shared with Bud Green. Shortly thereafter, Benny Goodman & His Orchestra played it on the Camel Caravan radio show, launching its rise to popularity. Slim & Slam's record peaked at number 2 on Billboard charts and at number 5 on Your Hit Parade. Lyrics The lyrics are brief and are dominated by the repetition of the title words and the nonsense refrain, \\"floy-doy, floy-doy, floy-doy\\". The original lyric, recorded in January 1938, was \\"flat foot floozie with a floy floy\\"; Vocalion, however, objected to the word \\"floozie\\", meaning a sexually promiscuous woman, or a prostitute. The second recording in February changed the word to \\"floogie\\". In the second part of the title phrase, \\"floy floy\\" was slang for a venereal disease, but the term was not widely known and failed to catch the attention of censors. It was regarded as nonsense and came to have positive connotations as a consequence of the song. Other versions Many artists covered the song in 1938: Wingy Manone on May 23; Nat Gonella; Benny Goodman & His Orchestra on May 31 (Victor 25871); Louis Armstrong with The Mills Brothers on June 10 (Decca 1876); as well as Woody Herman and Count Basie. In Europe, Fats Waller recorded it in London while on tour (HMV BD5399), an instrumental version was recorded by jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt (Decca F-6776) and the Dutch singing duo Johnny and Jones covered it. Gaillard recorded \\"Flat Foot Floogie\\" again in 1945 for Bel-Tone, with an ensemble that included Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Jack McVea, one of several songs recorded during the session. Bel-Tone went bankrupt, but the recordings were acquired by Majestic and released in 1946. The song has continued to be revisited over the years. The Jacksons performed it twice on their 1970s variety show, the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain has included it in performances, and Nina Hagen covered it on her 2006 album Irgendwo auf der Welt. In other media The title for the 1938 Three Stooges film, Flat Foot Stooges, is a play on the song's title. The Goodman version of the song is heard in the 1993 film Swing Kids. It was one of three pieces of music included in the 1938 Westinghouse Time Capsule, along with Finlandia by Jean Sibelius and \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" by John Philip Sousa. Bill Holman's comic strip Smokey Stover contained a reference to the song in its November 26, 1938 edition: \\"It sounds like flat foot Flanagan with the foo foo.\\" Here, \\"flat foot\\" is slang for a police officer; Flanagan is reporting that an arsonist has escaped by burning down the jail. In the 1939 film Twelve Crowded Hours gangster George Costain (played by Cy Kendall) takes his \\"guests\\" to the Floy Floy Club. The 1980 film Atlantic City featured an aging gangster, played by Burt Lancaster, reminiscing about the heyday of the resort town when \\"Flatfoot Floogie with the Floy Floy\\" was a hit song.

Biography He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, to Torben Holck Colding and Benedicte Holck Colding. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1992 at the University of Pennsylvania under Chris Croke. Since 2005 Colding has been a professor of mathematics at MIT. He was on the faculty at the Courant Institute of New York University in various positions from 1992 to 2008. He has also been a visiting professor at MIT (2000‚Äì01) and at Princeton University (2001‚Äì02) and a postdoctoral fellow at MSRI (1993‚Äì94). Work In the early stage of his career, Colding did impressive work on manifolds with bounds on Ricci curvature. In 1995 he presented this work at the Geometry Festival. He began working with Jeff Cheeger while at NYU. He gave a 45-minute invited address to the ICM on this work in 1998 in Berlin. He began coauthoring with William P. Minicozzi at this time: first on harmonic functions and later on minimal surfaces. Honours He gave an AMS Lecture at University of Tennessee. He also gave an invited address at the first AMS-Scandinavian International meeting in Odense, Denmark, in 2000 and an invited address at the Germany Mathematics Meeting in 2003 in Rostock. He gave the 2008 Mordell Lecture at the University of Cambridge and gave the 2010 Cantrell Lectures at University of Georgia. Since 2008 he has been a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and since 2006 a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, and also since 2006 an honorary professor of University of Copenhagen, Denmark. In 2010 Tobias H. Colding received the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry together with William Minicozzi II for their work on minimal surfaces.http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/veblen-prize.html In justification of the reward the American Mathematical Society wrote: \\"The 2010 Veblen Prize in Geometry is awarded to Tobias H. Colding and William P. Minicozzi II for their profound work on minimal surfaces.

Logorrhea is sometimes classified as a mental illness, though it is more commonly classified as a symptom of mental illness or brain injury. This ailment is often reported as a symptom of Wernicke's aphasia, where damage to the language processing center of the brain creates difficulty in self-centered speech.  Characteristics  Logorrhea is characterized by the constant need to talk. Occasionally, patients suffering from logorrhea may produce speech with normal prosody and a slightly fast speech rate. Other related symptoms include the use of neologisms (new words without clear derivation, e.g. hipidomateous for hippopotamus), words that bear no apparent meaning, and, in some extreme cases, the creation of new words and morphosyntactic constructions. From the \\"stream of unchecked nonsense often under pressure and the lack of self-correction‚Äù that the patient may exhibit, and their circumlocution (the ability to talk around missing words) we may conclude that they are unaware of the grammatical errors they are making.  Examples of logorrhea  When a clinician says, \\"tell me what to do with a comb\\", to a patient who is suffering from Wernicke‚Äôs aphasia which produces the symptom of logorrhea, the patient may respond: ‚ÄúWhat do I do with a comb ‚Ä¶ what I do with a comb. Well a comb is a utensil or some such thing that can be used for arranging and rearranging the hair on the head both by men and by women. One could also make music with it by putting a piece of paper behind and blowing through it. Sometimes it could be used in art ‚Äì in sculpture, for example, to make a series of lines in soft clay. It's usually made of plastic and usually black, although it comes in other colors. It is carried in the pocket or until it's needed, when it is taken out and used, then put back in the pocket. Is that what you had in mind?‚Äù In this case the patient maintains proper grammar and does not exhibit any signs of neologisms. However, the patient does use an overabundance of speech in responding to the clinician, as most people would simply respond, ‚ÄúI use a comb to comb my hair.‚Äù In a more extreme version of logorrhea aphasia, a clinician asks the patient what brought them to the hospital. The patient responds: \\"Is this some of the work that we work as we did before? ... All right ... From when wine [why] I'm here. What‚Äôs wrong with me because I ... was myself until the taenz took something about the time between me and my regular time in that time and they took the time in that time here and that‚Äôs when the time took around here and saw me around in it‚Äôs started with me no time and I bekan [began] work of nothing else that's the way the doctor find me that way...\\" In this example, the patient's aphasia is much more severe. Not only is this a case of logorrhea, but this includes neologisms and a loss of proper sentence structure.  Causes  Logorrhea has been shown to be associated with traumatic brain injuries in the frontal lobe as well as with lesions in the thalamus and the ascending reticular inhibitory system and has been associated with aphasia. Logorrhea can also result from a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders including tachypsychia, mania, hyperactivity, catatonia, and schizophrenia.  Aphasias  Wernicke's Aphasia, amongst other aphasias, are often associated with logorrhea. Aphasia refers to the neurological disruption of language that occurs as a consequence of brain dysfunction. For a patient to truly have an aphasia, they cannot have been diagnosed with any other medical condition that may affect their cognition. Logorrhea is a common symptom of Wernicke's Aphasia, along with circumlocution, paraphasias, and neologisms. Often a patient with aphasia may present all of these symptoms at one time.  Treatment  Excessive talking may be a symptom of an underlying illness and should be addressed by a medical provider if combined with hyperactivity or symptoms of mental illness, such as hallucinations. Treatment of logorrhea depends on its underlying disorder, if any. Antipsychotics are often used, and lithium is a common supplement given to manic patients. For patients with lesions of the brain, attempting to correct their errors may upset and anger the patients, since the language center of their brain may not be able to process that what they are saying is incorrect and wordy.

On 8 March 1947, with President Sukarno, Vice President Mohammad Hatta and defense officials in attendance, the first free fall jump was executed by Flight Lieutenants Sudyono and Soekotjo at the same airfield. These jumps by personnel of the then Pasukan Pertahanan Pangkalan (PPP) (Air Field Defence Troops) would become the precursor for their baptism of fire. The PPP, raised in October 1945, months before the formal founding of the Air Force on 9 April 1946, was an active part in the defense of Republic-held air force bases. First airborne operations  The then republican Governor of Kalimantan Ir. Prince Muhammad Noor made a request to the Indonesian Air Force to send paratroopers to Kalimantan for the task of forming and organizing pro-Republic guerrilla organizations to assist in the revolution in Borneo, opening a parent radio station to allow connections between Yogyakarta and Borneo rebels and selecting more dropping zones for future operations. At the initiative of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, 12 indigenous sons of Kalimantan and two regular Air Force personnel were chosen.Sutrisno. \\"Marsekal TNI Suryadi Suryadarma\\" Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaaan, Jakarta, 1985. On 17 October 1947, thirteen airmen were successfully deployed in Sambi, West Kotawaringin, Central Kalimantan. They were Hari Hadi Sumantri (Semarang Radio Air Force mechanic), FM Soejoto (An Air Force Radio interpreter from Ponorogo), Iskandar (troop leader), Ahmad Kosasih, Bachri, J. Bitak, C. Williem, Imanuel, Amirudin, Ali Akbar, M Dahlan, JH. Darius, and Marawi. They were deployed from the C-47 Dakota RI-002 aircraft flown by an American named Bob Freeberg as well as the owner of the aircraft, co-pilot Warrant Officer Suhodo, and the Jumpmaster, Pilot Officer Amir Hamzah. Acting as the pointer to the parapet was Major Tjilik Riwut who was a native son of Borneo. This was the first airborne operation in Indonesian history. The pioneer airborne operation carried out by the thirteen Indonesian Air Force personnel on 17 October 1947 was later designated as the anniversary of the Komando Pasukan Gerak Cepat (Rapid Response Troop Commandos), later known as \\"Kopasgat\\", and today known as the Paskhas.Sesuai keputusan MEN/PANGAU No.54 Tahun 1967, tanggal 12 Oktober 1967. This makes this organization the oldest active special forces unit in Indonesia and within all of Southeast Asia, and the first airborne and air force infantry unit to be founded in the region. (The Philippine 1st Scout Ranger Regiment, the 2nd oldest, was established two years later in 1949.) Air Base Defense Troops (ABDT) By 1950 the Jakarta-based PPP was still known as the title of \\"Air Base Defense Troops (ABDT)\\", but now had paratrooper squadrons within its ranks. Troops were divided into eight companies/squadrons and led by Captain (later Major) RHA Wiriadinata with his deputy 1st Lieutenant R Soeprantijo. Then in the mid-1950s, the Inspectorate of Air Base Defense Forces (IPP) was based in Sabang, Jakarta, which in April 1952 was transferred to Cililitan Air Base, East Jakarta. An additional service, the PSU ('Penangkis Serangan Udara, Air Defense Component) was later added to provide an air defense capability. The Parachute School was also opened to train future Air Force paratroppers at the Andir Air Force Base in Bandung, West Java, as a continuation of the Para School embryo in Maguwo. Its alumni, both officers and airmen, later formed the basis for the Kompi-kompi Pasukan Gerak Tjepat-PGT (Quick Reaction Troop Companies) which were formed in February 1952, with Captain Wiriadinata as the commanding officer and concurrently as Commander of Andir Air Force Base in Bandung. By 1958 these consisted of 11 Independent Airborne Companies, 8 Air Base Defense companies and 1 Air Defense Artillery Battery. PGT Combat Team Regiment (RTP-PGT) Subsequently, in the 1960s, PGT (Pasukan Gerak Tjepat (old spelling, Pasukan Gerak Cepat in the Perfected Spelling System): Quick Reaction Troops) was also assigned to the operation of West Irian (Papua) liberation under the command of the Air Force commander, which at that time the PGT Battle Team Regiment (RTP PGT) was based in Bandung with Captain (U) Sugiri Sukani as commander. Air Commodore RHA Wiriadinata was the first PGT commander (1952) which brought much progress to paratroopers in Indonesia, especially in the Air Force. The concept of PGT since its inception was focused on the ability of Commando and Para combined. Air Force Bases Defense Command (KOPPAU) On 15 October 1962, based on the a decree of the CSAF, the Air Force Bases Defense Command (KOPPAU, Komando Pertahanan Pangkalan Angkatan Udara) was established. KOPPAU consist of the Command HQ in Bandung, PPP (Air Base Defence Forces) Regiment in Jakarta and PGT Regiment in Bandung. The PPP Regiment was composed of the regimental headquarters and 5 Base Defense Battalions based in Jakarta, Banjarmasin, Makassar, Biak and Palembang (then moved to Medan). The PGT regiment consisted of 3 Battalions,: the 1st Battalion PGT (3rd Honor Guard (Air Force) Battalion, Cakrabhirawa Regiment) based in Bogor, 2nd Battalion PGT in Jakarta and 3rd Battalion PGT in Bandung, together with the regimental headquarters. The battalions were subdivided into the battalion HQ company and 3‚Äì5 parachute infantry companies, base defense companies or air defense artillery batteries, depending on specialty, the 1st battalion, which was assigned as public duties battalion, was assigned six guard of honour companies and the battalion HQ company. It was during that period that the Air Force, through the KOPPAU and the Indonesian National Air Defense Forces Command, acquired a surface to air missile defense capability, a first in Southeast Asia, via the S-75 Dvina SAM system, leading to the formation of the 100th Medium/Long Distance Missile Regiment/Wing. Kopasgat KOPPAU was, as a result of recommendations given during a Ministry of Defense conference in Bandung dated 11‚Äì16 April 1966, then transformed to KOPASGAT (Komando Pasukan Gerak Cepat) with the strength of 3 Regiments each based in Bandung, Jakarta, and Surabaya, under its new commander Air Commodore Saleh Basarah. Each of the regiments were organized into a HQ unit and 3‚Äì5 groups/battalions, each divided into 3‚Äì6 companies/squadrons/batteries (the Bandung wing had 2 battalions). Furthermore, based on the Air Force chief of Staff Decision No. 57 on 1 July 1970, the term \\"Regiment\\" was changed into \\"Wing\\" for distinguishing their unit names from the Indonesian Army (as part of a general reorganization of the armed forces under the Suharto administration). Kopasgat was then famous for its Leopard camouflage pattern uniform which was worn during Operation Seroja, led by then commander Air Commodore R. Suprantijo, and its orange berets, a singularity within the National Armed Forces.  Puspaskhasau  Puspaskhasau (Pusat Pasukan Khas Angkatan Udara meaning \\"Air Force Special Forces Command\\") later replaced the name Kopasgat. It was based on the dynamics of organizational improvement and consolidation of TNI units, then based on Air Force Chief of staff Decision No. Kep / 22 / III / 1985 dated 11 March 1985. Air Commodore LE Siagian was the first commander of the rebadged unit.  Korpaskhasau  Along with the improvements of the TNI and Air Force organization, on 17 July 1997 according to the Decree no. SKEP / 09 / VII / 1997 of the Commander of the National Armed Forces the status of Paskhas was elevated from Central Executive Agency status to that of a Principal Combatant Command (Kotamabin) and was therefore renamed as the Korps Pasukah Khas Angkatan Udara/ KORPASKHASAU\\" which is simply called as Korps Paskhas or just PASKHAS. It was in time for the 50th anniversary of the first airborne jumps in Kalimantan. Air Commodore Budhy Santoso was commandant when the changes were made. In 2011, to reflect the importance of the Paskas to the Air Force, the rank of the commanding general was changed into that of an Air Vice Marshal, the commanding general then being AVM Amarullah who was appointed that year replacing Air Commodore Harry Budiono. Bravo Detachment 90 right The Bravo Detachment 90 or (Satuan Bravo-90 / Satbravo-90) previously named Denbravo 90 is a counter-terrorism unit under the command of the Paskhas commander. The Paskhas Bravo Detachment 90 unit is tasked with carrying out intelligence operations, crippling enemy weaponry and installations in support of air operations, air piracy terror assault, and other operations in accordance with the policy of the TNI chief Commander. This unit is known as the youngest-formed Indonesian special operations unit within the Armed Forces (TNI). The concept of formation refers to Giulio Douhet's thought; \\"It is easier and more effective to destroy the opponent's air forces by destroying its base and its equipment on the ground rather than fighting in the air\\". The motto of this Unit is in Sanskrit which is: Catya Wihikan Awacyama Kapala, that literally means: Faithful, Skilled and Successful. Strength Paskhas troops during parade Airborne missions Recently, Paskhas has had a strength of around 7,300 personnel. The orange beret and Commando dagger have become trademarks of this special force. Previously the concept of Paskhas duty was as air force base defense troops (Defensive) only, but then it was further developed to be combined offensive and defensive troops force as the main Air Force infantry corps that can be deployed for assault and airborne operations. As a component Principal Command of the Indonesian Air Force, the Paskhas Corps is structured into the following in accordance with the provisions of presidential decree No. 62/ 2016: Commando Battalions Paskhas commandos from the 469th Commando Battalion during hostage rescue operation in anti- terror gear # Special/Elite Troops, which are : ## Bravo Detachment 90 ## 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Paskhas Matra Detachments # Air Parachute Commando Division consists of 9 Paskhas Commando Battalions which are under the structure of 3 Brigades.

Paskhas Divisions *1st Paskhas Division Central (composite) ‚Äì Jakarta Consists of: 1st Matra (branch) Detachment, 1st Combat battalion with 6 companies, 1st base defence battalion with 7 companies (some still under formation), 1st Brigade/Wing with 3 battalions of commandos, and 1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment with 1 battalion and 3 detachments (some still under formation). *2nd Paskhas Division East (composite) ‚Äì Makassar Consists of: 2nd Matra (branch) Detachment, 2nd Combat battalion with 6 companies, 2nd base defense battalion with 7 companies (some still under formation), 2nd Brigade/Wing with 3 battalions of commandos, and 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment with 1 battalion and 3 detachments (some still under formation). *3rd Paskhas Division West (composite) ‚Äì Medan Consists of: 3rd Matra (branch) Detachment, 3rd Combat battalion with 6 companies, 3rd base defense battalion with 7 companies (some still under formation), 3rd Brigade/Wing with 3 battalions of commandos, and 3rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment with 3 detachments (some still under formation). = Air defense = The orange beret corps has been also reinforced with the arrival of 200 surface-to-air QW(QianWei)-3 surface missiles. Manpad QW-3 missiles (expected addition of about 300 units again for Pam Sat Radar) QW-3 missiles are equipped with semi-active laser guidance trackers, suitable for fighter and other missiles at low altitudes of up to 8 km. It has a weight of 13 kg and a maximum speed of 750 km / hour. This weapon is used to replace Triple gun made by Hispano Suiza (Switzerland) in the 1950s and DSHK 12.7 mm. Also a few moments ago Pindad tested the weapon to be rehabilitated to be used as heavy weapons for Paskhas ground forces units. Paskhas is also working on bringing in a short-range PSU battery of 35 mm caliber Oerlikon Contraves to Air defense composite model point that is integrated between missiles, cannons, radar and tactical command posts. This weapon has been using the most advanced technology and has been used by many European countries. According to the plan, this PSU weapon will be placed in the 10th Main Air Force Base. One of the other major advantages to this 35 mm 35mm Oerlikon PSU is its ability to be mobilized with Hercules aircraft. The Air Force purchased in 2017 a set of 10 batteries of the NASAMS-2 system to suit their requirements for a medium-range missile / JSe substitute for the S-75 / SA-2 Guideline SAM, which was introduced to the service in the 1960s, Going forward with the arrival of the 35mm aerophonic contraves gun, the addition of the number of QW-3 manpad missiles and some good triple gun cannon units. The National Air defense forces command (Kohanudnas) also plan to revive the Medium-Long Missile Wing, to be composed of several artillery groups/battalions of air defense artillery guns and within each Paskhas wing 2 air defense missile artillery groups/battalions, each composed of a HQ unit, a number of AAA gun or missile (MANPAD or distance missile) batteries, a replacement battery and a target acquisition battery. In the future development of Paskhas, the current PSU weaponry in service or are being commissioned are: *Oerlikon Contraves 35 mm (expected 55 units replacement Triple Gun 1950) *Manpad QW-3 individual missiles (expected to add about 300 more units to Pam Sat Radar) *NASAMS 2 Medium Distance Missile / JSe Substitute missile for the S-75 / SA-2 Guideline (aimed to arm 7‚Äì10 batteries for a potential total of 32-34 batteries, ordered 2017) = Individual and vehicle weaponry = Paskhas is now seeking to replace Pindad SS1 individual weapons to SiG-552 or Pindad SS2. Especially to prepare command battalions such as the 461st commando battalion and 469th commando battalion as assault troops, then in each team in each postal battalion will be equipped with SS2-V1 with Pindad 40mm Grenade Launcher and Squad Automatic Weapon sub- machine guns such as FN Minimi (Automatic Weapon Team). While in the assistance company will be equipped with SMB (Heavy Machine Guns) DShk-38 which is designed as a weapon for short-range land and air objectives. SMB is commonly used by cavalry and infantry units. In the cavalry unit, DShK has become the standard placed on various turrets of the MBT (Main Battle Tank), even light tanks, APCs and Rantis pick ups. In the infantry units, it is natural that DShK is operated with a two-wheeled special case, similar to a cannon model. Thus the SMB is easily moved, carried or moved with the help of a hook on a military jeep or truck.  Combat qualifications  Paskhas soldiers during air base defense operations which are capable for conducting Air Traffic Control activities during air base lock-down status Paskhas personnel are an integral part of the TNI-AU, having their own specialty. Paskhas personnel have the qualifications and special ability to protect, defend and operate airfield facilities. The basic qualification for all Paskhas personnel has been \\"para-commando\\". Other qualifications are added based on his specialty. As a Combat Control team (CCT), they have combat free- fall ability, scuba diving, and combat climber. CCT must be able to infiltrate from three media aspects (sea, air, land). Beside that, this team's personnel must have one of the air aspect specialisations, such as: Air Traffic Controller (PLLU), Meteorology (Meteo), Electronic-Communication (Komlek), Combat Field Engineer (Zeni), Intelligence, Fire Fighter (PK), Ground handling, Petroleum affairs (Permi), and Combat-Health affairs (Keslap). For free-fall qualification, they must be brave enough to jump from high altitude and open the parachute at minimum altitude. The airborne technique that used was HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) or HAHO (High Altitude High Opening), with jumps around above sea level. Specialization Paskhas commandos in formation before parade in an Indonesian Air Force base for commemorating the Corp's anniversary The Paskhas Corps is divided into several Specializations which are: #Training and Education Center (Pusdiklat), is responsible for carrying out the training of Paskhas abilities through the implementation of Education, Exercise, Research, Testing and Development of Tactics and Procedures to carry out the task of seizing objectives and defense of Air Force Strategic Objects, Air Defense, Special Operations and Typical Air Force Military Operations. #Anti Terror (Bravo Detachment 90), is responsible for carrying out Intelligence Operations, Airborne Aspects of Terror Countermeasures Operations and other Special Operations in Air Force Military Operations under the policy of the TNI chief Commander. #Branch Detachment (Detasemen Matra), is in charge of carrying out combat control operations, base controls, combat Search and Rescue, and Jumpmaster trainings for Paskhas personnel. #Air Defense Detachment (Detasemen Hanud), is part of the Paskhas air defense detachment which is in charge of carrying out air defense operations as part of the national air defense system and other military operations according to the policy of the TNI chief Commander within the Air Force organization. #Para-Commandos (Parako), are Infantry Commandos in a Battalion size tasked with carrying out Paskhas main operational combat tasks such as target assault operations and defense operations of the Indonesian Air Force's strategic objects during combat and peace-time situations #Support Brigade (Resimen-Resimen Banpur), serves as an assistance force for combatants especially Commando troops who are usually deployed to the frontline of battle, either in the form of combat or administrative support. The Paskas is organized into two regiment-sized support formations, the Combat Support Regiment and the Administrative Support Regiment. Operations=Operation Trikora During Operation Trikora, the Paskhas corps then \\"PGT AURI\\" in the Trikora operations deployed a total of 532 paratroopers ‚Äì the largest number of military personnel operationally deployed to West Papua. The number of personnel from TNI, National Police (Mobile Brigade) and volunteers taking part amounted to 1,154 personnel with 216 deaths / lost and 296 captured. On 25 April 1962, during the operation of Banteng Ketaton as many as 40 PGT troops under the leadership of Sgt. Maj. J. Picaulima was deployed for the first time in West Irian in Fak-Fak area as well as the 39 PGT troops in Kaimana on 26 April 1962 did well. On 11 May 1962, PGT troops under the leadership of 1st Lieutenant Manuhua conducted a jump in Sorong during Operation Serigala. One of the heroic and historic stories is the event of the National flag hoisting for the first time on a hill named Cendrawasih, in West Papua, conducted by Paskhas members at the initiative of Sergeant M.F. Mengko. On 19 May 1962, a total of 81 Paskhas paratroopers departed from Pattimura Air Base, Ambon, on board a C-130 Hercules transport plane piloted by Major (U) T.Z Abidin towards the target of a parachuting area around Wersar Village, Teminabuan District. In the early morning they were deployed just above the headquarters of the Dutch army. Suddenly close combat was unavoidable. Dutch troops which were sleeping was in shock because there are troops of Paskhas deployed right in their bases, while Paskhas soldiers also did not expect to be deployed in the Dutch base, rather being deployed in tea plantations. This heroic action resulted in the death of 53 Paskhas parachute commandos including the platoon commander 2nd Lieutenant Suhadi. To commemorate the historic event in the area around Teminabuan in Sorong, West Papua, a monument that is named Tugu Merah Putih (Red and White monument) was later built on the site of the battle.http://weaponstechnology.blogspot.co.id/2011/06/ Other operations *Operation Dwikora ** Landing at Pontian *Operation Seroja *Operation Trisula *Rebel assault operations Peacekeeping Missions *Garuda Contingent in Vietnam *XIV Garuda Contingent under UNPROFOR in Yugoslavia *XIV A-B Garuda Contingent in Bosnia *XVII Garuda Contingent under OKI in the Philippines *XXIII Garuda Contingent in Lebanon See also * Indonesian Air Force * Kopassus ‚Äì Indonesian Army special forces. * Kopaska ‚Äì Indonesian Navy tactical Frogman commando. * Denjaka ‚Äì Indonesian Joint Navy- Marine special forces.

Museum Jorn holds the collections that were developed by Asger Jorn (1914‚Äì1973) from the early 1950s until his death in 1973, since when they have doubled in extent. In consequence, the museum is not only home to the most comprehensive collection of Jorn‚Äôs own works but also holds thousands of paintings, sculptures and works on paper by other artists ‚Äì members of the CoBrA avant-garde art movement and older international artists who inspired Jorn or were kindred artistic spirits including, among others, Max Ernst, Francis Picabia, Fernand L√©ger and Man Ray.Troels Andersen, Niels Frithiof Truelsen The new Silkeborg Museum of Art (International Journal of Museum Management and Curatorship Volume 3, Issue 3, September 1984, Pages 285-292)  History and architecture  Museum Jorn's history dates back to 1940 when the Silkeborg and Omegn Museum Association made its first acquisitions of art. In 1951, a single room in the local history museum in Silkeborg (Silkeborg Museum) was converted to hold modern art. In 1961 the museum opened an exhibition at the premises of a school building in Silkeborg, and in 1965 the independent institution Silkeborg Museum of Art was founded. In 1973 the museum took over the whole school building, where the museum was housed until 1982. At the anniversary of Asger Jorn's birthday, on March 3, 1982, Silkeborg Museum of Art moved to a newly built complex of buildings on an 8,000 m2 site near the river Guden√•en. The building was designed by the architect Niels Frithiof Truelsen and was inspired by the studio Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi in front of Centre Pompidou in Paris. Because of the museum's large international collection, own acquisitions, and artists‚Äô and collectors' donations the premises were inadequate. This resulted in an extension that was inaugurated in 1998. The extension was also designed by Niels Frithiof Truelsen. Thereby, the exhibition area was increased to 3,200 m2 along with a daylight free gallery in the basement for exhibition of works on paper. In 2010 the museum underwent a major renovation and changed its name to Museum Jorn, Silkeborg. A modern Cobra Forum was designed so that visitors now can immerse themselves in the museum's extensive research material on and by Asger Jorn in electronic media and in books. With the reopening and change of name it is highlighted that the museum will continue to challenge its current role. The many new initiatives are part of the strategy to respond to Jorn's vision for the museum and to promote the artist who is considered to be Denmark's most significant in the 20th century.  Collections  Museum Jorn houses over 30,000 works by more than 600 different artists from around the world including some 100 paintings, and as many ceramic works, graphics and drawings. Two large ceramic walls donated by Jean Dubuffet and Pierre Alechinsky meet the visitors in the museum's courtyard, which also features ceramic blue stones designed by Erik Nyholm. The museum's own collection comprises works that reach back to around 1900 with work groups of Johannes Holbek, Julius Paulsen, Albert Gottschalk and from the following decades Jens Adolf Jerichau and Aksel J√∏rgensen. From the second half of the 20th century works of Sonja Ferlov, Erik Ortvad, Frank Rubin, Paul Gernes, Per Kirkeby and Richard Winther are shown. The collection also contains works by artists from Eastern Europe. The museum's collection comprises also contemporary works by Georg Baselitz, Andreas Slominski, Poul Gernes and Per Kirkeby. Inside are works by some of the artists who inspired Jorn: Max Ernst, Francis Picabia, Le Corbusier, Fernand L√©ger, Man Ray. The Danish art is represented by Ejler Bille, Bjerke Petersen, Carl-Henning Pedersen, Egill Jacobsen, Henry Heerup and Wilhelm Freddie. From Cobra group the following can be mentioned (besides Asger Jorn): Pierre Alechinsky, Karel Appel, Constant Nieuwenhuis, Reinhoud D'Haese, Theo Wolvecamp.

The Mixodectids originated in the late Cretaceous and survived into the Paleocene in Europe and North America.  Description  While there is less anatomical evidence for this group than for other archaic placental families (such as apatemyids, pantolestids, leptictids, and palaeoryctids), preserved dental and cranial anatomies give an idea of mixodectid dietary requirements. Their rodent-like dental pattern was similar to that of the multituberculates, with a pair of large, strong, and forward- directed incisors and a row of multi-cusped and low-crowned premolars and molars a specialized dental set-up probably used for crushing and opening hard seeds and nuts. Torrejonian (Middle Paleocene) Mixodectidae had a dental set- up similar to the oldest Plagiomenids and is therefore supposedly an ancestral (or sister) group of the latter. For many years Elipdophorus, the oldest plagiomenid, was classified as Mixodectidae but was finally regarded as more closely related to plagiomenids in the 1970s based on derived dental resemblances. Though the relation between Mixodectidae and other early placental mammals from the \\"insectivore-primate transition\\" remain unclear, clearly a number of the archaic mixodectid dental features seem to foreshadow the more derived conditions of plagiomenids. Furthermore, the postcranial skeleton of Mixodectes shows arboreal specialization similar to those of Plesiadapiformes and Dermopterans, supporting their inclusion within Euarchonta.

Odd Arild Kval√∏y (born December 28, 1948) is a Norwegian politician for the Centre Party. He is best known as the county mayor of Rogaland from 1991 to 1999, being Rogaland's first county mayor to win re-election. He was born in Stavanger, and is an agrotechnician by education. He worked in the Felleskj√∏pet Rogaland Agder, an agricultural cooperative retailer, from 1970 to 1981. He then worked in the Centre Party organization from 1981 to 1987, and in the bank SpareBank 1 SR-Bank from 1988. He served as a private secretary in the Ministry of Transport from 1985 to 1986, in Willoch's Second Cabinet, and private advisor (both positions are today known as political advisor) in the Ministry of Local Government from 1989 to 1990, in Syse's Cabinet. He had experience in local politics, where he was a member of Stavanger city council from 1980 to 1987, the last four years in the executive committee. He was also a city councilman from 1991 to 1995, and a member of Rogaland county council from 1983 to present. From 1991 to 1999 he served as the county mayor of Rogaland. He first tried to become county mayor after the 1991 election, and managed to edge out right-wing candidate, the incumbent Arne Rettedal. The centrist parties formerly cooperated with the right-wing parties in the county council (as well as in Willoch's and Syse's cabinets), but decided to support a centrist candidate due to unhappiness with Rettedal's leadership. Support from the Norwegian Labour Party swung the vote: Kval√∏y received 37 votes in the county council, whereas Rettedal received 28 votes and Kari Oftedal Lima received 6. After the 1995 elections, Labour fielded its own candidate, but in return Kval√∏y received the support from Rettedal's Conservative Party as well as the Pensioners Party. Kval√∏y received 41 votes, Sven H. Andersen 20 and Ola Ingvaldstad 10. Kval√∏y was the first county mayor to win re-election. His successor Roald G. Bergsaker would achieve the same feat. From 1995 to 1999 Kval√∏y led the collegium of county mayors in Norway. In 1994 he became a member of the board () of the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities; he advanced to deputy leader in 2000. In 2008 he ceased to be deputy leader, being succeeded by Bj√∏rg Tysdal Moe, but continued as a board member.

The school was opened in September 1939 and became a Business and Enterprise College in 2003, with the addition of Applied GCSE courses to the curriculum. The Priory was a girls' grammar school, but has since become a mixed non-selective school. The Business and Enterprise training centre was opened in September 2004 and became an Enterprise Hub in April 2006, and was awarded High Performing Specialist School status at the start of the academic year 2007‚Äì08. The school has no sixth form, but is in partnership with the Shrewsbury Colleges Group, which was created by the merging of the two main local further education institutions (Shrewsbury Sixth Form College and Shrewsbury College), which the large majority of pupils go on to attend. The school was granted Academy status in June 2012, giving it independence from the Local Education Authority and the ability to manage its own affairs with direct government funding. It became a multi-academy trust in 2016 with Coleham School and St Martins, followed by Thomas Adams School in March 2020. In 2013, an Ofsted inspection report rated the school as 'outstanding' in all four categories (in both of its previous inspections), making the school the top performing in the county by Ofsted's criteria.http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/2237533/urn/138216.pdf Houses Each of the school's six houses, named after famous people from or associated with Shropshire, battles it out for the 'House Cup', received by the house with the most points at the end of the house year. They are called Acton, Baxter, Clive, Darwin, Houseman, and Webb. This runs from the start of the summer term to the end of the following spring term, so pupils in Year 11 are always still at school when the cup is awarded. Every year the school holds a variety concert organised and presented by Year 11 Drama and Music Officials, with support from the Head of Drama and Music. It was formerly known as the Eisteddfod but was renamed the 'Pro Show' in 2005. The event showcases dancing, singing, bands, drama sketches and stand-up comedy, all performed by pupils. In 2014, a new video category was introduced, allowing pupils to be awarded for multimedia creations.

Stories=Family Man The story is set in a Wyoming \\"Old Folks' Home\\" for old cowboys, ranchers and their womenfolk. Old cow-poke Ray Forkenbrock has skeletons in his closet he must talk about before he dies. The past is inescapable. Mid-way through relating his early life to his granddaughter, Forkenbrock realizes that one of his fellow residents is the woman he first had sex with 71 years before; a day later that same woman falls to her death in the Grand Canyon. Forkenbrock had discovered, at his father's funeral, that he was not his father's only son called Ray. He was in fact one of four: his father had four families, the children all named the same to avoid mistakes. I've Always Loved This Place Satan's personal assistant, one Duane Fork, busies himself spreading dust and sulfurous smells for his boss's return from a Milan design fair. The Devil is piqued by an article in The Onion reporting that a Tenth Circle of Hell had been added to accommodate Total Bastards. Them Old Cowboy Songs Rose and Archie are a young married couple‚ÄîArchie is only 16‚Äîsetting out to make a life for themselves. At first, things are idyllic: they are very much in love. But then Archie gets laid off from the ranch where he has been working and heads to Cheyenne to find a job, leaving Rose behind in their cabin with a baby on the way. He has to hide that he is married because the tyrant he works for would fire him if he knew, since married men tend to want time off to go visit their wives. He tries to write a letter to Rose but does not have the money for a stamp. Meanwhile, Rose is alone and miserable. There are complications with her pregnancy, and no way for her to get help. She finally buries the baby. Archie, after a fall in a bog, comes down with pneumonia and cannot work, so his boss fires him. Another hand tries to help Archie get home but they get caught in a blizzard and freeze to death. In the spring, a friend of Archie and Rose comes by and finds her mutilated body.

It was established in 1940 as the Presiding Bishop's Fund for World Relief. Episcopal Relief and Development works in approximately 40 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, the U.S. and the Middle East. They build partnerships with local Episcopal and Anglican dioceses and related organizations based on need, capacity and available resources. Program Areas Episcopal Relief and Development works with church partners to rebuild after disasters and empower people to create lasting solutions that fight poverty, hunger and disease. Working in close to 40 countries, their programs impact the lives of approximately 3 million people. Their international development programs seek to mobilize local resources and expertise toward sustainable, community-led programs that address poverty, hunger and disease. The four core program areas are: * Alleviate hunger and improve food supply * Create economic opportunities and strengthen communities * Promote health and fight disease * Respond to disasters and rebuild communities Starting in 2012, Episcopal Relief and Development introduced Asset-Based Community Development. This model of development uses the gifts and talents that people already possess, while facilitating solutions rather than directing them. The method produces sustainable community-driven solutions. Episcopal Relief and Development staff conduct regular monitoring visits to all program sites. Sustainable Development Goals, an initiative of the United Nations, is a set of goals which build on the work of the Millennium Development Goals. They target a range of development issues such as poverty, hunger, disease, gender inequality, and access to clean water and sanitation. Inspired by these global goals, all of Episcopal Relief and Development's international development programs seek to mobilize local resources and expertise toward sustainable, community-led programs that address poverty, hunger, and disease. History Originally called the Presiding Bishop's Fund for World Relief (the PB Fund), the organization was established in 1940 by the Episcopal Church. Its initial mission was to assist refugees fleeing Europe during World War II. Soon after the war, the agency's efforts expanded to include additional humanitarian assistance, focusing mostly on disaster relief. With increased funding in the 1960s and 1970s, the PB Fund increased its operational capacity and expanding programming to incorporate sustainable development. In the 1980s, major fundraising initiatives supported responses to famine in Ethiopia, an earthquake in Mexico, and a volcano eruption in Colombia. Later that decade, the Episcopal Migration Ministry was developed, funded out of the PB fund to meet the growing needs of refugee ministries, allowing the Fund to focus on long-term development work. After Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the PB Fund undertook disaster relief work in Honduras that focused on integrated community development. Over four years, an entire community was constructed, with 200 houses, a school, a clinic and a church. Micro-finance activities and agricultural projects were launched to create economic opportunities and improve food supply. The combination of rebuilding and development through micro-finance and other initiatives helped spur economic growth in the devastated region. This integrated approach became a core element of the agency's disaster relief work. In 2000, the PB Fund was renamed Episcopal Relief and Development to emphasize its disaster relief work and its increased programmatic focus on integrated community development. Two years later, Episcopal Relief and Development was incorporated as an independent, 501(c)(3) organization. In 2003, the Board of Directors decided to shift from administering small grants for domestic and overseas projects to implementing long-term development programs and partnerships. The organization formally endorsed the Millennium Development Goals, eight benchmarks developed by the international community to reduce extreme global poverty by 2015. In 2004, the agency worked in 21 countries, reaching nearly 250,000 people annually. As of 2015, Episcopal Relief and Development is working with close to 3 million people each year in approximately 40 countries. In 2004 and 2005, Episcopal Relief and Development undertook large-scale disaster responses to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. NetsforLife, a program partnership to fight malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, began as a pilot in 2006 and was established in a growing number of countries. Since 2010, the US disaster program has expanded through the Disaster Preparedness Initiative to support and equip Episcopal Church leaders to prepare for and respond to disasters in their communities. Episcopal Relief and Development partnered with the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti to offer immediate aid to those affected by the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the initial years following the quake, the agency provided emergency relief in the form of food, medicine, and assistance in finding shelter for those who lost their homes. The organization has since shifted to long-term sanitation, shelter provision and employment creation programs, assisting more than 40,000 people in 2011 alone. Episcopal Relief and Development collaborates with World Health, Idjen, and the Bishop Tharp Business and Technology Institute to foster activities in education, business development and micro-credit. 2014‚Äì15 marked Episcopal Relief and Development's 75th anniversary. Elements of the celebration included a traveling photo exhibition, the 75 Stories Project, and fundraising campaigns.

Charles Terront (9 April 1857 - 31 October 1932) was the first major French cycling star. He won sprint, middle distance and endurance events in Europe and the United States. In September 1891 he won the first Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis cycle race, which at was more than double the length of any previous event. He rode a Humber bicycle fitted with prototype removable pneumatic tyres made by Michelin. He won 54 major events over his 15-year career, was 'Champion of France' twice and 'Champion of Great Britain' twice. Early life and career Terront was born in Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis. He took up cycle racing in 1876 along with his brother Jules. Charles excelled at both endurance and speed events, and also won many events on a tandem with his brother Jules. He won 54 major solo events over his 15-year career, including being Champion of France twice and Champion of Great Britain twice. In 1879 he covered in 24 hours.Cicloweb Italia On 27 September 1893 he left Saint Petersburg in Russia to cycle across Poland and Germany, arriving at the V√©lodrome Buffalo in Paris after 14 days and 7 hours. In 1894 he completed a ride from Rome, Italy, to Paris. Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis cycle race Pierre Giffard of Le Petit Journal created the Paris-Brest et retour cycle race in September 1891, describing it as an \\"√©preuve\\", a test of the bicycle's reliability and the rider's endurance. Riders were fully self-sufficient, carrying their own food and clothing and riding the same bicycle for the duration. The response was so phenomenal that they had to charge 5 francs entrance as 300 riders signed up. Each bicycle was given an 'official seal' at a 2-day ceremony, the 280 sealed machines included 10 tricycles, 2 Tandem bicycles, and 1 Penny-farthing. Participation was restricted to French men (7 women were refused entrance) and 99 of the 207 (or 280) participants finished. Charles Terront won the event, covering the in 71 hours 22 minutes, riding a Humber bicycle from the Beeston works in England, which weighed 21.5 kilograms and was equipped with Michelin's prototype pneumatic tyres (which were patented in 1891), front brake, curved handlebars, and a chain guard. He passed his main rival Jiel- Laval from Adolphe Cl√©ment's Dunlop Cl√©ment team, after his manager, H.O. Duncan, advised him to take a detour around the town where his rival was sleeping during the third night. Both had suffered punctures in their pneumatic tyres, but still enjoyed an advantage over riders on solid tires. Terront's arrival in Paris was watched by a crowd of 10,000 people, many of whom had waited throughout the night. Honours Terront's fame meant that he was the first athlete to have his memoires published during his lifetime. In 1893 he explained his life, races and training methods to French journalist Louis Baudry de Saunier. Also in 1893 En suivant Terront by Herbert Duncan and Pierre Lafitte used 100 drawings to follow his ride to Paris from Saint Petersburg. A plaque in Brest commemorates his 1891 victory in the Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis. The Rue Charles Terront in Nantes is named in his honour.

Mayer. He entered Yale University in 1944, but his college years were interrupted by military service (he served as a counter-intelligence agent in US-occupied Japan). Upon his discharge he re- entered Yale and graduated in 1949, then trained at the Juilliard School and the Mannes College of Music, studying with Roger Sessions and Felix Salzer, and later with Otto Luening, Emanuel Balaban and Izler Solomon. The composer wrote three stage works in addition to his prize-winning A Death in the Family, and a variety of orchestral, chamber, choral and vocal works. John Rockwell of The New York Times has pointed out that Mayer was \\"especially known for his operas and songs ... his work sings out with real beauty, both in the vocal writing and the instrumental settings.\\" Distinguished artists have introduced his scores: Robert De Cormier led the New York Choral Society in its Lincoln Center premiere of \\"Spring Came on Forever\\"; sopranos Heidi Grant Murphy, Eleanor Steber and Christine Brewer have all premiered vocal- chamber works; and Leopold Stokowski (at eighty-eight) conducted Mayer's piano concerto Octagon at Carnegie Hall with William Masselos as soloist. Mayer taught composition and orchestration at Boston University; was a guest lecturer at Yale, Columbia, the Pratt Institute and the Juilliard School; fulfilled writing and cultural assignments from the US Information Agency, one of which involved preparing lectures on American chamber opera to be delivered abroad; served on judging panels for the MacDowell Colony, the American Composers Orchestra, Composers Recordings, Inc., the National Opera Association and the National Federation of Music Clubs; and was Composer-in- Residence at the Conductors' Institute and Adirondack New Music Festival.

AmeriGrove also touches on his humor: \\"His style is characterized by a contrasting of transparent textures with humorous, highly rhythmic and densely scored passages.\\" This humor is seen in the micro-opera Brief Candle (Milton Feist),Brief Candle in which a mime is hurdled from infancy to marriage, and then death in six minutes, followed by a ten-second recapitulation. It is also present in an article entitled \\"Good Friend, Bad Piece\\" (co-authored with his daughter Jane Mayer), which addresses a not-infrequent dilemma: what to say to a composer friend after having just heard‚Äîand disliked‚Äîhis new piece.

Early life & family Karwowski was raised in a small town in Eastern Poland, surrounded by one of the largest nature parks in Europe, Biebrza National Park. His father, Jozef Karwowski, was a social worker and promoter of culture and his mother Larysa (maiden name Zub) was a hairdresser. He has one younger brother, Maciej. Karwowski grew up in a multigenerational family under the strong influence of his father and Russian grandfather, Szymon Zub. His father gave him his first drawing lesson, and his grandfather was also creative, writing poetry and singing old Russian songs. His later work was influenced by Polish and Russian culture and traditions, as well as a childhood surrounded by the wilderness that encouraged his sensitivity and strong feelings of individualism. Painting and performance art Antoni Karwowski. After graduating high school Karwowski started painting more and experimenting with different forms of art. He changed homes and universities several times while looking for a place where he could fully develop his talents. He worked as a miner while conducting his search, and later joined the Fine Arts Faculty at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ, where he developed his talents and became a professional artist.Malarstwo Antoniego Karwowskiego, Bogdan Bombolewski, Spojrzenia, listopad 1982 In early 80s Karwowski and Zbigniew Oleszynski started a Polish performance group known as \\"Group A\\".Przedstawiamy ‚Äì grupa A From that time on, Karwowski has been heavily engaged in performance art, both as an organizer and a participant. Since 2003 he has organized the International Performance & Intermedia Festival in Szczecin. Throughout his career Karwowski has created his own style of which a Berlin art critic said, \\"From his images comes colorful light, which is created by perfection in his workshop. Metaphor of this light gives magical, surreal meaning to figurative elements in his paintings. The power of his paintings, aside from illuminating colors, comes from the richness of symbolic meanings and certain multilayer by which Karwowski ‚Äôs paintings are far from simple decorative function.\\"Berliner Zeitung, 2005 Karwowski's paintings focus on color and light, requiring close contact and time to fully understand. His paintings are housed in various private collections in Europe. He has also been commissioned by compound corporations and institutions, such as the Clinic in Dortmund (Germany) in 2005. For the clinic, he created 53m long wall panels that have received attention from a wide audience. thumb200pxleft\\"Walking the dogs\\" by Antoni Karwowski.

The participants included a regular \\"panel\\" that appeared regularly on the show, and an additional guest participants related to the specific debate of each show. The show was canceled, but was inscribed in the Israeli public memory, following a unique Israeli outright-blatant style of debate that has evolved among the regular participants. The show is a milestone program, having formulated a new political-Talk show format. History 'Popolitica' 1993 show The show was first aired in 1992, on the Israeli public Channel 1, formulated by producer Aaron Goldfinger, who envisioned a show in which political debates are taking place, and in the midst of these debates, small breaks that will include pop music, in an in-studio playing, that will be conducted by various singers and bands ‚Äì and so the show was granted its name Popolitica (Pop+Politics). Within a short period of time, the show developed its characteristic format, and was regularly hosted by two veteran news and political show hosts, Nissim Mishal and later, Dan Margalit, and included the regular following \\"panel\\": journalist Tommy Lapid (later made a political career out of his \\"stardom\\" as \\"panelist\\" of the show), journalist Amnon Dankner, and Haredi journalist Yisrael Eichler (also later made a political career out of his \\"panelist\\" role). The pop songs were gradually thinned out until they were completely removed, in a way that only the political-debates format remained, the debates that had granted the show its fame. The show was aired on Israeli channel 1 until 1998, when the \\"panelists\\" and the host left channel 1, and the show and its format were moved to the commercial Channel 2. 'Popolitica' style The panel team, who are known for their argumentative abilities and sharp tongues, have made waves among the Israeli public. The Israeli secular-right and conservative voice was represented by then Journalist Tommy Lapid, Journalist Amnon Dankner expressed the secular-liberal left, and Haredi Journalist Yisrael Eichler raised the voice of the Haredi sector. The characters of the panel team, as was reflected on the show, and other additional special guests with an argumentative style, that were brought for the purpose of each show's specific debate, have all together created a fermenting atmosphere, full of inflammation, while the host was not always able to control either the debate or sometimes even the panel or its special guests. Occasionally, at the hype of the argument, one participant would even leave the studio angrily, a \\"live\\" departure on television. In other occasions, the arguments came close to a skirmish event. 'Popolitica' legacy The show's style has gained high ratings but also conflicting reactions. Many reported loving to watch and listen to the arguments of the show, but others saw in it mainly an extreme expression of poor and cheap Populism, aimed at glorifying the regular participants' abilities, while humiliating people with different political opinions or some who are not accustomed to such loud debates. The show's style was inscribed in the Israeli public memory, and its format-style was later reflected on many other political-debate shows, which have practically continued the original 'Popolitica' show, with its noisy debates, that makes an impression on the audience and gains high ratings. The word 'Popolitica' was coined in Israel as a synonym for Populism and Demagogy; It is being used when one wants to describe an inflammated argument with a fluent spokes people who use an outright-blatant style. The show also coined some famous quotes: \\"I didn't interrupt you - you don't interrupt me!\\" (), or, \\"Let me finish a sentence\\" () The program, its \\"panel\\" and 'Moetzet HaHakhamim' show 'Popolitica' was canceled and other Israeli channels attempted to revive its format-style under new program names. Many believe that the \\"panel\\" team made their way to a better career through the show. Journalist Tommy Lapid lead the Shinui party with his rhetorical abilities, previously observed on the show, into the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, and was elected on a wave of his popularity from the show to head that party, and then appointed to be a Cabinet Minister. Journalist Amnon Dankner, made his way in journalism, among others, after the show, he became the chief editor of the second largest Israeli newspaper, Maariv, and Haredi Journalist Yisrael Eichler also made a career in politics when he was elected, after the show, to be a Knesset member with United Torah Judaism party. The original show was reunited for a one-time reunion on Israeli Channel 10, a day prior to the 2006 Israeli legislative election. The show, at the time, was about to return with its regular format (on the same commercial channel 10), however, the original creators demanded from the host, Journalist Dan Margalit to remove the original title-name 'Popolitica', for various Copyright reasons, and the old-new show was renamed 'Moetzet HaHakhamim' (lit. Council of [Toarh] Scholars). Haredi Journalist Yisrael Eichler has retired from the old-new show, and his place was filled, for a short period of time, by the Haredi well-known politician Aryeh Deri. Over time, a new \\"panel\\" team was established that included: The host, Dan Margalit, the veteran panelists, Journalists Tommy Lapid and Amnon Dankner, and new regular panelists, right-wing Likud Knesset member, Tzipi Hotovely, and known Haaretz liberal news paper Journalist, Ari Shavit. 'Moetzet HaHakhamim' kept up the \\"good work\\", and debates on the show - just like in the original show of 'Popolitica' - rose to high tones, until the show went to a long break in December 2007, to be filled in, in its airing time by Survivor 10: The Caribbean. As of today (2010), another version of the original show is aired on the public Israeli channel 1, renamed \\"Politica\\" (Politics), and hosted by Oded Shahar.

The manuscript has complex contents. Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 13th century. It was not adapted for liturgical use. It came from Epeiros, it is housed at the University of Michigan. It was digitised and it is available online.  Description  The codex contains the text of the four Gospels, on 256 parchment leaves (size ). The text is written in one column per page, 22 lines per page. It is neatly written in minute hand. The style of writing resembles codex 542 (Scrivener's 555).Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener, Adversaria Critica Sacra: With a Short Explanatory Introduction (Cambridge, 1893), p. L. The text is divided according to the (chapters), whose numerals are given at the margin in red, (titles of chapters) at the top and bottom of the several pages. There is also a division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections (in Mark 235 Sections, the last section in 16:12) in red, (no references to the Eusebian Canons). The and the Ammonian Sections are often put in wrong places. There are no lectionary markings at the margin for liturgical use. It contains lists of the (tables of contents) to the last three Gospels, and pictures of the Evangelists: Matthew, Mark, and John. The decorated head-pieces stand at the beginning of each Gospel. It has not lectionary markings at the margin (for liturgical use). The nomina sacra are contracted in usual way. ; Errors Errors of iotacism (especially ŒµŒπ or Œπ for Œ∑, Œø for œâ, and vice versa) are rare in the first two Gospels, but more frequent afterwards.

It was then purchased from him by a representative of Baroness Burdett-Coutts (1814‚Äì1906), a philanthropist, along with other Greek manuscripts (among them codices 532-546). They were transported to England in 1870-1871.Robert Mathiesen, An Important Greek Manuscript Rediscovered and Redated (Codex Burdett-Coutts III.42), The Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 76, No. 1 (Jan., 1983), pp. 131-133. The manuscript was presented by Burdett-Coutts to Sir Roger Cholmely's School, and was housed at the Highgate (Burdett-Coutts III. 9), in London. In 1922 it was acquired for the University of Michigan.Kenneth W. Clark, A Descriptive Catalogue of Greek New Testament Manuscripts in America (Chicago, 1937), p. 294. It is currently housed at the University of Michigan (Ms. 25) in Ann Arbor. ; Examination It was added to the list of the New Testament manuscripts by F. H. A. Scrivener (557) and C. R. Gregory (544). Gregory saw it in 1883. Scrivener examined, described and collated its text. His collation was edited posthumous in Adversaria critica sacra in 1893. It is rarely cited in the critical editions of the Greek New Testament.

Typically these anomalies are associated with granite plutons and with sedimentary basins. Gravity anomaly maps of Ireland, Britain and the surrounding islands are interpreted as indicating the presence of granite plutons in the following areas. The list is not exhaustive: *Galloway, UK *Cheviot Hills, UK *Mountains of Mourne, UK *Connemara, Ireland *Donegal, Ireland *South West England (Cornubian batholith and Haig Fras granite), UK *Askrigg Block (Yorkshire Dales), UK *Alston Block (North Pennines), UK *Grampian Highlands (Cairngorms etc.), UK The Weardale Granite, a batholith some 60 km by 25 km in extent underlying the Alston Block of the northern Pennines, was first detected by gravity survey. Drilling of the Rookhope borehole subsequently confirmed the existence of this substantial body of granite. A combination of gravity anomaly data and boreholes has permitted geologists to work out the shape of this pluton.Stone et al. 2010, 'British Regional Geology: Northern England' (5th Edn) British Geological Survey pp97-98 A further borehole was drilled at Raydale to investigate the origin of the gravity anomaly underlying the Askrigg Block. This proved the existence of the Wensleydale granite - a body of rock which is nowhere exposed at the surface.Aitkenhead et al. 2002, 'British Regional Geology: The Pennines & adjacent areas' (4th Edn) British Geological Survey p15 Similarly, negative anomalies coincide with the following sedimentary basins (amongst others): *Moray Firth Basin *North Channel Basin *Solway Basin *Kish Bank Basin *Munster Basin *Vale of Eden *Vale of Clwyd *Cheshire Basin *Worcester Basin *Hampshire Basin *Cardigan Bay Basin *St George's Channel Basin *Wessex Basin *Rockall Basin *Porcupine Basin The negative anomaly associated with the Worcester Basin/Graben has sharp margins and is particularly pronounced. Work by researchers, Cook and Thirlaway and also by Brooks in the 1950s and '60s resulted in estimates of the thickness of the sedimentary rock sequence in the basin. Models for the structure of the basin are in part based on their interpretation of the gravity anomaly together with data from seismic surveys and a borehole at Kempsey.Barclay, WJ et al. 1997 'Geology of the country around Worcester, Memoir of the British Geological Survey' sheet 199 (E&W;) The Lairg Gravity Low is suspected to be due to a buried impact crater 40 kilometres in diameter. Positive anomalies Positive gravity anomalies are associated with areas where Precambrian basement rocks are at or near the surface or where volumes of basalt or other similarly dense rocks have been put in place. Intense gravity highs coincide with a series of Palaeogene volcanic centres associated with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and including those at:Emeleus, CH & Bell BR 2005.

Its name originates from the Old French word \\"dars\\" which is the nominative form of the word \\"dart\\" in reference to their swimming pattern. The western blacknose dace (Rhinichthys obtusus) formerly was considered conspecific. While morphologically the two species are not significantly different, they are allopatric. The eastern blacknose dace is found across the southeast portion of Canada and down along the United States' east coast. It is dark brown to olive on its dorsal surface and silvery white below, the two shades separated by the darkly pigmented lateral line. In the breeding season, males develop darker pigmentation and an orange lateral line. Blacknose dace live in rocky streams and rivers where they feed upon small invertebrates and microscopic biological matter and provide forage for larger fish. Physical description As a fry, this fish is 5 mm long, and some of the larger eastern blacknose dace can reach slightly over 100 mm. They tend to live for two or three years and grow continuously during this period.Trial, J.G., J.G. Stanley, M. Batcheller, G. Gebhart, O.E. Maughan, and P.C. Nelson. 1983. Habitat suitability information: Blacknose dace. U.S. Dept. Int., Fish Wildl. Servo FWS/OBS-82/10.41. 28 pp. They have a fusiform body shape and the mouth is in a subterminal position. The lateral line is darkly colored and has 56 to 70 scales from anterior to posterior. Above the lateral line coloration can vary between shades of dark brown and even olive, while below the lateral line coloration is lighter up until a white belly. Their caudal fin is forked, and their single dorsal fin has 8 fin rays and no spines. They have a pair of pectoral fins and a pair of abdominal ventral fins, as well as an anal fin with 7 rays. All fins are clear to yellow except males during spawning season acquire an orange to red tint in all fins and along the lateral line. Distribution and habitat This fish is mainly found along the southern border of Canada extending along from Manitoba to the Atlantic Ocean, south along the east coast of the United States and slightly inland to South Carolina and Georgia.http://maps.iucnredlist.org/map.html?id=202361Jenkins, Robert E., and Noel M. Burkhead. Freshwater fishes of Virginia. American Fisheries Society, 1994. Scientists hypothesize that 20,000 years ago, as the glaciers retreated, blacknose dace recolonized the region from a single refugium in modern-day Connecticut, as soon as 75 years after the ice receded. This fish tends to inhabit headwaters, creeks, and small rivers with swiftly moving water. However, fry mature in slower moving portions of the habitats like shoals and pool margins. The species as a whole prefers cool, rocky areas and uses the stones to rest under and around. They also use overhanging vegetation and undercut banks for additional refuge. In the winter, they migrate from headwater streams into rivers and can be found in deeper water under banks. Diet and predation The eastern blacknose dace eats many small insects and other invertebrates including Acentria ephemerella, telmatogetoninae, chironomidae, worms, algae, and small crustaceans such as young crayfish. They also feed on some plant species. Young fry forage in shallow silty water while adults move into riffles and deep eddying pools to find invertebrates. Many larger fish feed on the eastern blacknose dace including smallmouth bass, brook trout, brown trout, and rainbow trout. They are also preyed upon by the common merganser and the blue heron. Reproduction Eastern blacknose dace spawning takes place between May and June and occurs in shallow water over gravel riffles. During this breeding season, the male develops nuptial tubercles on various parts of the body including the head and fins. His coloration also turns orange-red during this time along the lateral stripe and pectoral fins. Males of this species are nonterritorial and mate with one female. Eggs are deposited into crude nests which are depressions in the gravel created by vigorous movement during spawning. Larger females have higher fecundity and lay between 400 and 1100 eggs. Following egg deposition, there is little to no parental care for the young.

Western blacknose dace have tan to dark brown backs, lighter sides, and cream colored undersides. Dark blotches are sporadically scattered across their sides and backs. A distinctive dark colored mid-lateral stripe from the tip of the snout to the caudal peduncle is present. The snout is relatively long and they have a slightly sub-terminal mouth. The stripe is dark brown in females and is a rusty pink color in males during spawning season. The lateral stripe is more pronounced and the caudal spot is present in juveniles. Similar to other species of dace the western blacknose dace give the illusion of having no scales but in actuality the scales are so small they are hard to see. Western blacknose dace are typically 2-3 inches long but can grow to as long as 4 inches. They have a forked tail, single dorsal fin with 8 rays and no spines, a pelvic fin on the abdominal, no adipose fin, and an anal fin with 7 rays and no spines.  Habitat and ecology  The western blacknose dace inhabits the upper Mississippi, Ohio, and Great Lakes drainages, from as far north as south-central Canada to northern Alabama and Georgia and east to eastern Lake Erie. Young daces prefer to inhabit shallower, quiet pools with silty bottoms while more mature daces prefer streams with consistently high turbulence patterns and plenty of places to hide since they are a prey species. Most often they occupy water depths ranging from 100 to 200 mm with gravel or cobble bottoms. They can also be found in riffles hiding under large rocks or boulders.  Reproduction  Spawning begins in spring and continues to mid-summer depending on water temperature. The western blacknose dace spawn in areas with gravel bottoms unlike other daces who spawn in the beds of other Cyprinids. Since the western blacknose dace is so short lived, only living up to four years, daces begin reproducing after 2 years. Unlike other species of dace the two Ohio Rhinichthys species do not spawn in the nests of larger minnow species.  Food and feeding habits  Western blacknose dace are mostly carnivorous and exhibit changes in diet as they grow older. Young dace diets consist mostly of Dipteran larvae. Mature daces continue to feed on Dipteran larvae when available but a large portion of their diet also include amphipods. The change in diet is thought to be because of the change in the areas that they inhabit once the daces mature.http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/species-and-habitats/species-guide- index/fish/western-blacknose-dace  References  Category:Rhinichthys Category:Fish described in 1854 Category:Freshwater fish of North America ","title":"Western blacknose dace"},{"id":"25827374","text":"Umatilla dace (Rhinichthys umatilla) is a species of ray-finned fish in the genus Rhinichthys.

In June there were riots in Atlanta, Boston, Cincinnati, Buffalo, and Tampa. In July there were riots in Detroit, Birmingham, Chicago, New York City, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New Britain, Rochester, Plainfield, and Toledo. The most destructive riots of the summer took place in July, in Newark, New Jersey, and Detroit, Michigan, and many contemporary newspapers headlines describe them as \\"battles\\". As a result of the rioting in the summer of 1967 and the preceding two years, President Lyndon B. Johnson established the Kerner Commission to investigate the rioting and urban issues of Black Americans. History A history of institutionalized unemployment, abusive policing, and poor housing was already present in certain areas of the United States. Riots began to flare up across the country but especially during the summer months. While rioting happened across the country the Summer of Love was occurring in hippie communities, and Americans witnessed troop movements in the Vietnam War and in American riots on the nightly news. At the end of July, President Lyndon B. Johnson set up the Kerner Commission to investigate the riots, in 1968 they would release a report blaming pervasive societal inequalities in American ghettos for the riots. By September 1967, 83 were dead, thousands injured, tens of millions of dollars in property had been destroyed and entire neighborhoods were burned. Reactions It is in the context of having been through \\"long, hot, summer\\" that in December, 1967, Miami police chief Walter E. Headley uttered the now- famous phrase \\"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\\" after which Frank Rizzo, Richard Daley and George Wallace also spoke out in favor of a hardline approach towards looters and rioters. A poll of Minnesotans asked respondents to gauge the perceived relationship between the riots and the Civil Rights Movement. When asked if there were a connection between the movement and riots, 49% said there was, 38% disagreed. A full 65% thought the riots were planned, rather than just uncontrolled skirmishes. In another poll of Minnesotans, respondents were asked if the cause of the riots was racial discrimination or lawless hoodlums, 32% said racial discrimination while 49% said hoodlums. In a March 1968 Harris poll reported in the Washington Post, 37% of Americans agreed with the Kerner Commission‚Äôs report that the 1967 race riots were brought on mainly by inequalities; 49% disagreed. A majority of whites (53%) rejected the idea, with just 35% agreeing. In contrast, 58% of blacks supported it, and only 17% disagreed. In early July 1967, the Justice Department met with local media to ask \\"restraint in reporting\\". In December 1967, a psychologist was asked about \\"deterrents\\" and told the New York Times that the riots would continue. List of riots Some of the riots include: * Atlanta riot of 1967 (June 17) * Boston riot of 1967 (June 2) * Buffalo riot of 1967 (June 26 ‚Äì July 1) * Cairo 1967 riot (July 17) * Cambridge riot of 1967 (July 24, 1967) * Cincinnati riot of 1967 (June 12 ‚Äì June 15) * 1967 Detroit riot (July 23 ‚Äì 28) * 1967 Milwaukee riot (July 30 ‚Äì August 3) * 1967 Newark riots (July 12 ‚Äì 17) * 1967 Plainfield riots (July 14 ‚Äì 16) * 1967 Saginaw riot (July 26) * 1967 Portland riot (July 30) * 1967 Tampa riot (June 11) See also * 2020 United States racial unrest * Ferguson unrest * George Floyd protests * King assassination riots * List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States References=Bibliography * Further reading * Michael Omi and Howard Winant, Racial formation in the United States: from the 1960s to the 1990s (1994) * Walter C.

He is a competitor of the well-known Strongman Champions League and the Giants Live competitions. Martin is the current world record holder in the bavarian stonelift. Biography Martin was born in Kufstein, Tirol in Austria on 27 November 1987. He was a sports enthusiast even as a child and at the age of 10 started kickboxing. After winning some national competitions in Austria after two years he began boxing but due to school commitments he found he did not have the time to commit to boxing. With the time he did have he began weight training and although his parents tried to encourage this further by buying him weights at home he found that the best environment for his progress was the gym. A meeting with a powerlifter introduced him to deadlifting and squatting and by the age of 15 he was deadlifting 200 kg. He began to compete at the age of 16 years and soon began to set records, thus far having set over 40 new national records. He moved into strength athletics at nineteen, winning his first competition, a qualifier for the Austrian nationals. He then placed 5th at the Austrian nationals, improving this to third the following year. In the same year he won the Austrian Winter Giants competition. In 2009 a second place at the Strongman Fibo classic, behind Travis Ortmayer, qualified him for the Strongman Champions League. At his inaugural outing in the league in Serbia, he won the car deadlift and came 5th overall. He went on to compete at the next Champions league meeting in Finland, where he set a new official world record in the car deadlift and came 3rd overall. This in turn got him an invite to the pinnacle of strongman, World's Strongest Man. In what was deemed the \\"group of death\\" which also contained Zydrunas Savickas and Brian Shaw, he did not manage to qualify for the final. In 2009 he won the Austria's Strongest Man title. Martin recently won the 2010 Austrian Giants contest on 18 December 2010. He is trained by the renowned German strongman Heinz Ollesch.

It was founded on 18 June 2004 by Inal Khashig. It currently has a circulation of 1100 and its price is 10 ruble. February 2009 death threat to Inal Khashig=Initial reports In February 2009 Inal Khashig was the centre of a controversy when several media, among which Caucasian Knot and Abaza TV, reported that on 6 February, while at the embankment in Sukhumi, Khashig had been invited into a car containing David Bagapsh, a nephew of Sergei Bagapsh and head of his presidential guard, Kondrat Samsonia, General Director of A-Mobile and deputy of the Sukhumi Municipal Assembly and Adgur Tarba, head of the Municipal Advertising Agency. According to the story, Khashig was then driven to a sub-urban wasteland where he was threatened the same fate as Dmitry Kholodov and Anna Politkovskaya lest he change the tone of his publications. The direct motivation for the threat was said to be the critical article –ë–µ—Å–ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–Ω–∞—è –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å (Love without programme) published on 3 February in Chegemskaya Pravda about the congress of United Abkhazia held on 27 January. Initial reactions On 18 February, 31 Journalists signed a declaration addressed to President Bagapsh in which they demanded his intervention. Likewise, opposition politicians requested the law-enforcement agencies to intervene and members of the Public Chamber called upon all political actors to settle disputes within the law only. On 19 February, Khashig's original article was republished by the Russian news agency REGNUM. Presidential spokesman Kristian Bzhania denied the involvement of people from the president's entourage in the incident, and he said that he had spoken with Inal Khashig on the telephone and the latter had not mentioned the purported events. He also hinted that the conversation between Khashig and the three men had taken place in a waterfront cafe. Khashig's statement Khashig initially refused to comment on the reports. He then on 21 February released a statement in which he confirmed that the incident had taken place, while downplaying its seriousness. He denied reports which claimed that he had been taken to the woods and had been beaten. He also denied that he had been taken anywhere by car. Instead, he said that the men had walked to a deserted beach near Kelasuri and that, taking into account that he knew two of the men quite well, the conversation had not been out of line. Khashig did confirm that Kholodov and Politkovskaya had been mentioned, while saying that due to their youth the men probably did not appreciate the semantic load of these names. Khashig stated that he had not responded to the reports earlier as he did not want to exacerbate an already dramatic situation, and that he was forced to change his mind when the story grew out of proportion. He thanked people for coming to his defence, but stressed that he did not want to be seen as a martyr or a sacrificial lamb. He also wished for the three involved men not to be regarded as crooks. According to Khashig, the principal lesson of the episode was that a journalist is free to raise any sensitive issue, and that those who feel hurt should challenge the journalist through legal channels only. Bagapsh's statement Following Khashig's declaration, President Bagapsh released a statement in which he said that he agreed with Khashig that problems can only be solved within the legal framework. He added that he had been concerned about the reported incident, as he had always been a staunch defender of the freedom of speech, but that he had waited with his reaction until all the facts had become clear. He condemned the opposition parties who had not done so and who had used the opportunity to \\"wage an information war against the government\\". June 2009 printing problems In the week of 5 June 2009, the newspaper's printing house Alasharbaga refused to print it, giving the lack of profit from publishing the newspaper as its reason. Inal Khashig accused the government of being behind the action with the upcoming 12 December 2009 presidential election in mind. This was denied by Prime Minister Alexander Ankvab, who argued that Alasharbaga was a private business, and by Presidential Spokesman Kristian Bzhania, who pointed out that the newspaper had been warned in advance by its printing house and that Alasharbaga had not stopped publishing the larger government-critical newspaper Ekho Abkhazii.

It has become an invasive species in rivers of the Eastern Cape, South Africa, such as the Mbhashe River.Mbhashe River System Introduction The Orange-Vaal River system is one of the few in South Africa that is truly international. The source of the Orange river is in Lesotho and that of the Vaal on the Mpumalanga highveld whereas their tributaries extend well into most provinces of South Africa as well as into Botswana and Namibia. The Orange river eventually flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Oranjemund on the West coast border between South Africa and Namibia. The river drains hugely diverse terrestrial habitat types ranging from grasslands, mountains and karoo to desert. This results in diverse riverine habitats that include clear mountain streams, turbid waters of the middle Orange river and the nutrient-rich discoloured water of the lower reaches of both rivers. Several in stream dams have changed the natural flow of the upper reaches to a regulated flow in the middle and lower reaches. This river system is home to South Africa's best known and favourite sport yellowfish, the Orange-Vaal smallmouth yellowfish, L. aeneus. Biology and ecology The smallmouth yellowfish is a hardy and adaptable species that is widespread across its natural distribution range. It has the ability to inhabit smaller streams owing to its smaller size. Attaining a mass of around 9 kg it is an opportunistic feeder, eating a variety of food types ranging from plant material to aquatic insects, crabs, shrimps and small fish. The smallmouth yellowfish is a slow-growing species with a low egg-to-mass ratio (fecundity), only becoming sexually active at a fork length of 30 cm when it is almost seven years old. During the spawning season the skin of the male fish is covered in sensory papillae, giving it a rough feel to the touch. This is also found in females but to a lesser extent, therefore always wet your hands before handling fish as dry hands can remove this critical mucous layer that protects the skin and scales. When water temperatures exceed 19 ¬∞C in Spring, small shoals of fish migrate to shallow rocky areas to spawn and may do so intermittently from October to February. The long spawning season is an adaptation to the food-driven river and ensures that yellowfish will be able to lay eggs whenever favourable conditions occur. The eggs are relatively large and have a double \\"shell\\", allowing the fish to spawn in rough rapids and riffles. The fast water is highly oxygenated and a highly productive zone for algae, diatoms and aquatic insect larvae and nymphs. The juvenile fish have silver bellies and a characteristic olive-green back with black spots. They gather in small shoals in favourable habitat.  Distribution  The Orange-Vaal river system, also translocated to Gouritz, Great Fish and Kei river systems as well as the Limpopo river and Kyle dam in Zimbabwe.  Habitat  Prefers clear flowing waters of large rivers with sandy or rocky substrates. Also thrives in large impoundments.  Diet  Larger fishes are omnivores depending on availability of food with benthic invertebrates, incl. bivalve molluscs, vegetation, algae and detritus. Status The smallmouth yellowfish is listed as \\"Not Threatened\\", as it is still widespread across the Orange-Vaal River system and is in abundance in most suitable habitats. However, recent fish kills in the middle Vaal river and some tributaries are a cause for concern, as they have the potential to cause substantial damage to valuable recreational fisheries. Threats Water pollution in the form of effluent from municipal sewerage plants, agriculture and mine water return flows perhaps pose the most serious threat to yellowfish in the middle to lower Vaal river and several of its tributaries. Whereas most of the ingredients of the effluent are not directly toxic to fish, the enriched water facilitates algal blooms that reduce dissolved oxygen concentration to lethal levels. (see NCYWG ongoing research report). Additionally, bacteria that break down organic waste produce by products such as ammonia and nitrites. At elevated levels these nitrogenous wastes are highly toxic to fish and even sub lethal concentrations can seriously damage their gills. Over abstraction of water from tributaries during the dry Winter months result in stretches of river being laid dry, killing fish and their food. In stream dams such as the Vaal and Gariep dams are barriers to fish migration and also regulate river flow, modifying food driven flows for much of the year. Illegal netting takes place all over both river systems, usually near informal settlements. However some land owners or entrepreneurs trying to make extra money from selling fish, are also implicated. Law enforcement operations in which the South African Police Service is actively involved are under way. Several alien fish species are now common in parts of the Orange and Vaal rivers. The predatory largemouth bass flourish in several dams on tributaries of the Vaal and in the Barrage below the Vaal dam. Carp are widespread and common in the system and compete with smallmouth yellowfish for food as well as eating yellowfish eggs at spawning time. The recent explosion of grass carp in dams of the middle Vaal river is seen as a potentially serious threat as this prolific species grows to more than 20 kg and is an obvious competitor for food. Angling is one of the most popular forms of recreation in South Africa. Moreover, many subsistence fishermen depend on fish to provide their families with a valuable source of protein. Smallmouth yellowfish is a target for both parties who need to be informed of its conservation status. The two groups also need to bee managed effectively. At present, each province straddling the Orange-Vaal catchment area has different policies regarding the capture of yellowfish which complicates law enforcement and angler awareness. The effect of wading through spawning beds (especially by fly anglers) may also be a threat to the survival of yellowfish in heavily fished areas. Most provinces have legislation that prohibits people from interfering with spawning fish. Conservation and utilisation Conservancies are terrestrial protected areas that are managed by conservation departments in some provinces. For those conservancies that include rivers, it offers an informal river protection facility. Bear in mind that conservancies can only be meaningful if participating land owners are made aware of river and fish issues and are guided in the implementation of relevant measures. The Orange-Vaal River yellowfish Conservation and Management Association (OVRYCMA) is an association of 700 interested and affected people that support yellowfish conservation. The association was established on the Vaal river in 1996. The aims are simple and include three basic conservation concepts: * Developing a managed conservation area * Releasing captured yellowfish * Educating and building capacity in people There is a considerable body of national and provincial legislation that enable authorities to respond to illegal activities on rivers such as pollution, netting, interfering with spawning fish, stocking of alien species and so on. Legislation incorporated in provincial nature conservation ordinances also permits the effective management of smallmouth yellowfish and their habitat by means of regulations governing minimum size, bag limits, spawning season, spawning areas, etc. A major concern however is the current lack of capacity in nature conservation at provincial and national level to manage rivers and freshwater fish effectively. The national River Health Programme (RHP) is used as the primary tool to monitor fish communities across South Africa. The Free State, Mpumalanga and Gauteng provinces have active and successful RHP's, but other provinces not. Yellowfish is generally used as an indicator species on the Orange and Vaal rivers to give managers an idea of the ecological state of the river. Large numbers of smallmouth as well as largemouth yellows in good health indicate ecologically healthy rivers. Research is critical for managers to develop an understanding of the species and how they interact with their environment. This allows them to make informed decisions with regards to water flow releases, pollution standards and fisheries management protocols. Several important and sizeable research programmes are currently under way on yellowfish in the Orange-Vaal system. These involve research on migration (Telemetry Project), conservation, genetics as well as a socio-economic study on the value of the resource. Smallmouth yellowfish are highly prized gamefish and their proximity to the Gauteng heartland is the keystone of the yellowfish fly fishing industry in South Africa. The angling tourism industry centred on the Vaal river has been valued at a massive R1.2 billion per annum which includes direct costs (angling equipment) and indirect costs (transport, accommodation and food). All forms of angling have targeted this species with great success and organised angling has been very supportive of measures to improve conservation of the two yellowfish species in this river system - competitive fishing for either species has been discontinued. Subsistence fishers catch smallmouth readily on natural baits such as worms, crabs and minnows. Unfortunately they often focus on spawning fish as these are easy prey. It is essential to develop a programme to teach these anglers to target the more abundant alien carp as well as the sharp-tooth catfish (barbel) instead. Subsistence and commercial fishers using trawl/seine nets and gill nets to target carp, catfish and moggel (Labeo umbratus) have operated for many years in certain designated dams in the Vaal and Orange rivers. The policy has now been changed and only trawl/seine nets may be used unless circumstances preclude their use, in which case a temporary permit may be issued to place gill nets in specific habitats where carp, moggel and catfish are most prevalent. The Free State Department of Tourism, Environmental and Economic Affairs provide smallmouth yellowfish for stocking of farm dams as an alternative to alien fish species. The Gariep Dam State Fish Hatchery is making use of subsistence anglers to catch smallmouth yellowfish which are then kept in dams at the hatchery. These fish are then supplied to land owners in the Orange river catchment area to stock dams. This method is preferable to culturing/breeding yellowfish which can result in unwanted hybrids as well as fish with genetic material less than ideal for release into natural systems. This protocol flows from concepts developed at previous conferences of the Yellowfish Working Group (YWG) which emphasise that the provision of yellowfish should not be left up to the private sector as there is no control of such institutions. Neither should yellowfish be allowed to be transported into or within any province without a permit from the relevant conservation authority.

(established 1893 in Halifax), and later renamed as Lantic Sugar Limited. The company was owned from 1981 to 1990 by Steinberg's. In 1984, Lantic Sugar acquired St. Lawrence Sugar, which had been established in 1888 in Montreal. Lantic Inc. was created from the merger of Rogers Sugar and Lantic Sugar on June 30, 2008. Facilities Lantic Sugar plant in Montreal The combined company operates the following facilities: * Montreal cane refinery: Located in Montreal, the refinery was originally built in 1888 by St. Lawrence Sugar. A major upgrade was completed in December 2000, upgrading normal capacity to ; this permitted the Saint John plant to close in July 2000. * Vancouver cane refinery: Located in the Port of Vancouver, the Vancouver facility primarily processes imported sugar cane into sugar products. * Taber sugar beet factory: Located in Taber, Alberta, this plant processes sugar beet into sugar products. The plant contracts with nearly 400 farmers each year to plant and grow sugar beets. * Toronto Distribution Centre: Located in New Toronto at 198 New Toronto Street, this warehouse receives processed sugar by rail and distributes it for the Ontario region. The warehouse also stores liquid sugar in tanks and is a liquid sucrose melt facility. * Toronto Blending operation: Located in Scarborough at 230 Midwest Road, this facility is used for bulk dry blending services.

History and construction The first government official known to have proposed building a dam to tame Rio Portugues from its devastating effects on the lives and properties of Ponce√±os was Ponce's 1899 Municipal Engineer-Architect Ramon Gandia Cordoba in his 16 March 1899 report titled Estado Actual de Ponce: Sus Necesidades y Medios Economicos para Satisfacerlas (Current State of [the Municipality of] Ponce, its Needs, and the Financial Means to Satisfy Them). It was a report to the Mayor of Ponce, Luis Porrata- Doria. Up to that point, the recommended solution to control the river had generally been to change its course, but Gandia Cordoba opposed it recommending instead that a dam be created.Socorro Guiron. Ponce, el teatro La Perla y La Campana de la Almudaina: Historia de Ponce desde sus comienzos hasta la Segunda Decada del Siglo XX. Gobierno Municipal de Ponce. Third Edition, 1992. pages 392-393. While other measures were undergone, such as widening the path of the river within the city of Ponce, no dam-building would take place for over seven decades. Since the 1970s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had been investigating a site to build the Portugu√©s Dam. Despite the many different geographic challenges, the Army Corps was able to choose a suitable dam location and double-curvature thin arch dam design in the 1980s. In the 1990s, foundation test grouting and foundation curtain grouting along with the excavation of of material for the left and right abutments took place. Portugues Dam foundation When the dam was advertised for construction in 2000, only one proposal was received, and its cost was over the government's budget. To reduce costs, a five-year technical review program was started to research new, lower-cost designs for the dam. The investigation resulted in a lower cost design, switching from the double-curvature thin arch to a single-centered roller-compacted concrete thick arch. Proposals for the dam were requested in 2007 and Dragados USA was awarded an $180 million contract in March 2008 to finish the dam project. Portugues Dam cofferdam construction Portugues Dam in 2014 Construction on the dam began in April 2008 and consisted of five phases. Phase 1, at a cost of $24.5 million, included the mobilization, clearing, quarry overburden excavation, power-line relocation activities; Phase 2, costing $47.6 million involved the foundation excavation, aggregate production, dental concrete chores; Phase 3, budgeted at $37.3 million, comprised the aggregate production, and ¬Ω dam RCC placement tasks; Phase 4, at $41.1 million, involved the final dam RCC placement, the spillway, and the intake structure jobs; and Phase 5, at a cost of $29.7 million included the remaining items, such as the valve house, the access road, and mechanical and electrical structures.USACE Portuguese Dam Construction - July 2009 As of March 2011, Phase 3 work was underway and the project was 48% complete. The rolled-compacted concrete production facilities had been completed, 700,500 tons of aggregate (for use in concrete) had been produced while foundation preparation continued. RCC placement was placed in of dam. Construction was initially expected to be completed by 2012, but was later postponed. In December 2013 the dam was completed and its inauguration occurred on 5 February 2014. Pending reservoir-filling and testing of the dam, making it operational was announced for early 2015. Dam characteristics Artistic rendering of Portugues Dam The Portugu√©s Dam is a high and long single-centered roller-compacted concrete thick arch. Containing of roller- compacted concrete, it is thick at its base and thick at its crest. The dam has an uncontrolled spillway center-left side, over the river bed; below the dams crest of above sea level. The center of the dam straddles an intake and outlet structure which will draw water from behind the dam and discharge it into the river valley.  Archeological findings  During excavation, a Pre- Columbian era ceremonial plaza (\\"batey\\" or ball court) used by the ancient Tainos was discovered at a construction site used for disposing of the Portugu√©s Dam's construction rubbish. A long row of intricately carved stones bearing petroglyphs that appeared to date to the 11th or 12th century was also discovered. Additionally, a burial ground containing 40 well-preserved sets of human remains was discovered. Fifteen percent of the site was believed to have been uncovered up to that point and it was reported that as many as 400 bodies may be buried there. The site had been initially marked during a cultural resource survey in 1979 but excavation work in 2007 prompted the major discovery.USACE Discovery of Pre-Columbian era Site Yields Rare Treasure 2009 The Army Corps of Engineers found an alternate rubbish disposal site and performed mitigation work in order to preserve the site, adding $3 million in additional project costs. Despite objections of locals, the Army Corps was bound by federal law and had to transport artifacts and human remains to a federally-approved laboratory in Georgia. The artifacts and human remains would, reportedly, be returned to Puerto Rico when the investigation is complete. The site was covered, awaiting future excavation.

He was mainly responsible for translating the philosophy of Immanuel Kant into the French language. Life Villers was born in Boulay-Moselle, France. He studied at the Benedictine College in Metz, and then became a student of the School of Applied Artillery of Metz. He attained the rank of captain. Like other officers of that era, such as the artillery colonel Armand Marie Jacques de Chastenet of Puysegur, he became interested in animal magnetism. After the horrors of the French Revolution, Villers moved to Germany and there in G√∂ttingen in 1794 befriended the German intellectual Dorothea von Schl√∂zer and her husband, the Mayor Mattheus Rodde. The Rodde- Schl√∂zer home was a centre for intellectuals across Europe. Dorothea was a pioneering female intellectual, the first woman to gain a doctors degree in Germany. Villers moved in with the Rodde-Schl√∂zers in 1797 and they lived semi publicly as a menage a trois the rest of their lives. Villers' French nationality was able to preserve the household from the worst ravages of the French occupation in 1806. He reported these catastrophic events in his Lettre √† Mme la Comtesse de Beauharnais, Fanny, contenant un r√©cit des √©v√©nements qui se sont pass√©s √† L√ºbeck dans le journ√©es du jeudi 6 novembre 1806 et les suivantes. In 1811, Villers was appointed Professor of Philosophy at the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1814, after the downfall of the Kingdom of Westphalia, he was promptly sacked by the Government of the Kingdom of Hanover. He died in G√∂ttingen in 1815 aged forty-nine. Significance Villers was significant as the individual who explained the works of Immanuel Kant to the French-speaking world. He portrayed the revolution in ideas produced by Kant as being as important in its significance as that produced by Descartes, Lavoisier and Copernicus. Works *Le Magn√©tiseur amoureux (1787).

From 1916 to 1920, he served as the mayor of St. John's, Newfoundland. Early life William Gilbert Gosling was born in Paget Parish, Bermuda to Charles Gray Gosling and Elizabeth Gilbert. The second of their six sons, Gosling attended Pembroke Grammar School in Hamilton, Bermuda. On June 22, 1881, he moved to St. John's, Newfoundland (now a province of Canada) to work as a clerk for the fish exporting firm Harvey and Company. Taking charge of the wholesale side of the business, Gosling was described as having a \\"marked aptitude\\" for the job.Gosling, William Gilbert - Dictionary of Canadian Biography. Retrieved 2010-01-16. Shortly after arriving in Newfoundland, Gosling met his future wife Armine, the headmistress of the Church of England Girls' School in St. John's. In his spare time, Gosling became invested in reading, and in 1899 published his first literary work, an article about the William Shakespeare work The Tempest in the London periodical Literature. The nine guineas earned for the publication of his piece were reinvested in his ever-growing collection of books. In 1906, Gosling helped to revive the Newfoundland Historical Society with fellow author Daniel Woodley Prowse. Around this time, Gosling became involved in historical writing when Wilfred Grenfell asked him to contribute a chapter on the history of Labrador to his book on his experiences as a Labrador physician. In 1910, this chapter was expanded into a published book, \\"Labrador: its discovery, exploration, and development\\", which remains an authoritative source on the subject today. The next year, a book on the life of Humphrey Gilbert, written by Gosling, appeared in London bookstores. In 1909, Gosling became the organizing secretary for the newly formed Newfoundland Board of Trade, and became president of the Board in 1913. The same year, he became a director at Harvey and Company. He argued against Newfoundland's confederation with Canada, saying that to tie down trade relations with Canada only would reduce Newfoundland's ability to use its income to acquire the cheapest resources possible, in whichever country they may be found. Political career Prior to his entry into municipal politics, Gosling led a fundraising effort to rebuild an Anglican cathedral which had been destroyed by fire, and in 1908 became the vice-president of the newly founded Association for the Prevention of Consumption. In 1914, the Newfoundland legislature replaced the local elected council in St. John's with an appointed commission consisting of twelve men. Governing the city for two years, the commission, of which Gosling was chairman, instituted a range of reforms, including a reorganization of water and sewage services and a new method of collecting and spending revenue. One such revenue reform included instigating legal proceedings against tax evaders who refused to pay after August 1, 1914. The commission also drafted a new municipal charter, which gave the local council more powers. However, the legislature rejected the draft, and restored the elected council.William Gilbert Gosling and the Charter: St. John's Municipal Politics, 1914-1921 - Melvin Baker, Newfoundland Quarterly. Retrieved 2010-01-16. In June 1916, a local election was held, and the electors of St. John's returned Gosling as their mayor. In 1920, another appointed commission replaced the elected council, governing the city until the revised town charter became law. Gosling's health deteriorated due to the stress of public life, and in 1921 declined to stand for re-election to the mayoralty. Later life In September 1927, William Gosling and his wife Armine returned to Bermuda, where he died three years later at the age of 67. His wife later donated his large collection of books to the people of St. John's to form the town's first public library, the Gosling Memorial Library.

Notable members  Fyodor Ivanovich Lisitsyn () was a progenitor of the dynasty, a weapons-maker and metalworker at his own brass factory in Tula. Ivan Fyodorovich Lisitsyn () and Nazar Fyodorovich Lisitsyn () were the two sons of Fyodor Lisitsyn. From their childhood they were engaged in metalworking at their family's factory. In 1778 they made a samovar, and the same year Nazar Lisitsyn registered the first samovar-making factory in Russia. They may not have been the inventors of samovar, but they were the first historically recorded and documented samovar-makers, and their various and beautiful samovar designs became very influential throughout the later history of samovar-making. Nikita Nazarovich Lisitsyn () was a son of Nazar Lisitsyn who inherited the samovar factory in 1823. That year they produced 423 samovars. Ten years later the production was about 625 samovars a year, but by 1853 it had fallen to 315. Nikita Nikitich Lisitsyn () was a son of Nikita Nazarovich Lisitsyn and the next owner of Lisitsyn factory. He had a great success with his samovars at the pan-Russia Fair in Nizhny Novgorod and managed to sell much of the production to Bukhara and Khiva in Central Asia, where sphere-shaped samovars had become popular. In 1856 Nikita Lisitsyn received a medal and a kaftan in recognition of the quality of his samovars. In 1863 Lisitsyn participated in an exhibition, organised on the arrival of a son of Alexander II of Russia to Tula. After that time the history of the Lisitsyn family is unknown.

Test work  On 4 April 1945, AH574 became part of aviation history when test pilot Captain Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown landed it on the flight deck of HMS Pretoria Castle--the first carrier landing made by an aircraft with retractable tricycle gear--due to a declared emergency during initial trials for landings on rubber decks planned for future carriers. In his autobiography, Captain Brown described the circumstances thus: > I had already collected a few 'firsts' in aviation, and I rather wanted to > be the first pilot to put a tricycle aircraft down on a flight deck. The > Airacobra was not officially cleared for such a landing, but the boffins had > told me privately that it would probably take the strain. > This was not on the official programme at all, but I hoped that I could > persuade Captain Caspar John of the Pretoria Castle to turn a blind eye to > what I had in mind.

For her performance in this episode, Jane Krakowski received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Plot During the TGS afterparty, new cast member Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson) admits to his boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), that he has been having an office romance but will not disclose the woman's name. While in attendance at a New York Knicks game, Jack asks more about the woman Danny is seeing and Danny reveals details, such as she has never let a man see her feet. This results in Jack's realization that the woman is the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), and he is displeased. Meanwhile, actress Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) auditions for a role she believes is for a college freshman on Gossip Girl. At the audition, Jenna learns that she is actually booked to audition for the role of the college freshman's mother. She panics, believing that this is a sign that she is no longer young, and in an attempt to reclaim her youth, begins acting young which causes the TGS writing staff to mock her. At the same time, movie star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to add a woman to his entourage as a learning experience when he and his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), have a daughter. He brings in the French-Dutch TGS writer Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway). Tracy later loses his temper with a crew member, thinking that he made a suggestive comment about Sue, causing NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to tell Tracy that he has become paternal towards Sue. Soon after, Sue begins rebelling against him, as Tracy treats her as a child. During the TGS after party, Danny's body paint‚Äîafter performing as a robot‚Äîhad not washed off and could be seen under the black lights at the party. As he knows about Danny and Liz's relationship, Jack later uses a black light on Liz to reveal body paint all over her‚Äîtransferred from Danny‚Äîrevealing to her that he knows about their relationship. Jack tells Liz to end the relationship, but she hesitates. Eventually, she tries to break if off with Danny, but when she sees him wearing a CHiPs costume, she changes her mind. Jack confronts Liz on the whereabouts of Danny, as Danny had skipped lunch with him, only for Jack to see Danny's CHiPs badge in her office. He orders her to end the relationship immediately, but Liz refuses, believing Jack is jealous. Simultaneously, Liz urges Jenna to come clean about her real age to the TGS staff, but Jenna balks at the idea. Liz tells Jenna if she tells everyone her real age, she will reveal her \\"friend Tom... Tom Selleck\\" her mustache, to which Jenna agrees. Later, Liz walks by the staff with the mustache in her face. Jenna thanks Liz for this, and as a result, Jenna accepts the role of the mother on Gossip Girl. Knowing that Liz will not break off with Danny, Jack tells Danny he knows about the two. He lies to Danny by telling him he cares for Liz, hoping that Danny will end it with Liz, which he does. After Sue returns from a night of partying, Tracy tells her that all he wanted to do was to be a father figure to her. Liz enters Tracy's dressing room‚Äîwith the mustache intact‚Äîto take Sue back to the writers' room, as Liz had been looking for her. At the end, Tracy wonders if he can go through his experience with Sue if he has a daughter, to which Kenneth says he thinks he can. Production Cheyenne Jackson made his third appearance as Danny Baker in this episode. \\"Black Light Attack!\\" was written by Steve Hely and directed by series producer Don Scardino.

The two series are shot next to each other at Silvercup Studios in Queens, New York. In September 2008, it was reported that actresses Blake Lively and Leighton Meester, who star on Gossip Girl, were set to guest star on 30 Rock, but the appearances fell through. Dr. Sanjay Gupta guest starred as himself in \\"Black Light Attack!\\"; Liz is at home and watches Dr. Gupta on CNN as he expounds about the rise in female libido before menopause, referred to as the \\"Dirty 30s\\". This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's third appearance as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his debut in the November 12, 2009, episode \\"The Problem Solvers\\", and would later guest star on \\"Secret Santa\\". Series' creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey set up a meeting to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson to the attention of the 30 Rock producers. While at the Knicks game, Danny reveals details to Jack, about the woman he is seeing, such as \\"She never takes off her shoes ... Even though the reason is she's never let a man see her feet\\", which is a real life trait of Fey's and her character. Reception Jane Krakowski received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance in this episode. In its original American broadcast, \\"Black Light Attack!\\" was watched by 5.014 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It received a 2.3 rating/6 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, that is 2.3 percent of all people in that group, and 6 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"Klaus and Greta\\", that aired the same day of the week, which was watched by 5.122 million American viewers. The episode's rating constituted a 30 percent drop from the December 10, 2009, airing of the 30 Rock episode, \\"Secret Santa\\", to a season low 2.3 rating. Nonetheless, \\"Black Light Attack!\\" was the third most viewed episode on the NBC network that week. Jane Krakowski received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards for her work in this episode, but lost it to actress Jane Lynch. The episode received generally mixed reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning felt that the episode \\"didn't have the same comedic appeal\\" as \\"Klaus and Greta\\", but did say there were \\"some funny moments to be sure\\", but overall the episode lacked. He commented that the main plot had its faults, but that the weak link in the story was Cheyenne Jackson's Danny. He wrote that the Sue character had been great in the past, but that her \\"expanded role\\" in this episode was less successful. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff wrote that \\"Black Light Attack!\\" was \\"dead in spots. I mean, I laughed out loud a number of times, but not nearly as much\\". She noted she liked Liz and Jack battling over Danny, but \\"something about it never landed in the way it should have\\", and opined that the show did not know what to do with Jackson. Overall, she gave the episode a B rating. Sean Gandert for Paste felt that the Liz, Jack, and Danny plot was less interesting \\"and in general pretty meh.\\" He noted that \\"Black Light Attack!\\" was \\"a big let-down\\" after the airing of \\"Klaus and Greta\\". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club called the episode uneven. Time contributor James Poniewozik wrote that \\"Black Light Attack!\\" presented the balance 30 Rock \\"has reached with Liz Lemon's character, allowing her to be simultaneously nerdy/awkward ... and strong ... Throw in a steady stream of solid throwaway jokes ... and you had a worthy toofer.\\" Nick Catucci for New York magazine enjoyed the episode, particularly Jenna's line \\"Would a mother be going on a sex tour of Vietnam?\\", after telling Liz about her booked role as a mother on Gossip Girl, as a \\"classic Jenna line, more absurd than hilarious\\", and that the character's rendition of \\"Forever Young\\" was a highlight. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger opined that this episode \\"made the best use yet of Cheyenne Jackson's Danny\\", and that he for once enjoyed \\"Jenna's narcissism and self-delusion\\" subplot, and her \\"late attempt\\" to seem young. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed \\"Black Light Attack!\\", though, his only complain was that 30 Rock did not focus more on the fictional show TGS, and said he would \\"like to get back to more of that.\\" Entertainment Weekly‚Äôs Margaret Lyons remarked that this episode and \\"Klaus and Greta\\" were terrific, and what stood out from both airings \\"was how much serialized plot[s] these two eps covered ...

He and NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) immediately travel to Massachusetts and break into Nancy's home while she is on vacation, hoping to erase the message. While Kenneth fumbles with the computer, Jack examines the house and finds evidence that Nancy's marriage is reaching its end - he husband's clothes are on the couch, their sinks are separated, and they have booked flights to different places. They eventually play the message, after Jack finds the voicemail code, in which Jack reminisces about their times in high school German class.

Jack decides not to erase the message, but Kenneth does so anyway, telling him that there is no sign Nancy wants Jack in her life.

In November 2009, it was announced that actor James Franco would guest star on 30 Rock as himself, and would carry on a fake romance with Jenna Maroney (Krakowski), in a scheme concocted by their respective agents. Two months earlier, series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey revealed Jenna's plot to Entertainment Weekly, but did not divulged Franco's name. In an April 2010 interview with Zap2it, Carlock revealed that \\"one of the things\\" the staff looked forward to in the fourth season was Jenna's storyline here, and said her \\"emotional realization\\" that she wants more than a fake relationship with Franco was \\"a cool turn for that character after three years of thinking that all she wants is to have her picture in the paper and have her hair look good.\\" In this episode, Matt Lauer, a co-host of The Today Show, guest starred as himself for the second time first appearing in \\"Generalissimo\\" that aired on February 5, 2009, during the show's third season. In \\"Klaus and Greta\\", the staff writers of the fictitious sketch comedy show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan play a shot game to The Today Show's travel tips given by Lauer. Despite not appearing in the episode, the show made reference of Jack Donaghy's romantic interest in high school sweatheart, Nancy Donovan, portrayed by actress Julianne Moore. Moore was announced as a love interest for Alec Baldwin's Jack in November 2009, and made her debut as the Nancy character in the previous episode \\"Secret Santa\\". This episode of 30 Rock was filmed on November 6, 2009.

Randy tells Liz that a man offered to drive him to her apartment if he helps him move a couch into a van, but she tells him he is a serial killer. This is a reference to the 1991 thriller film The Silence of the Lambs in which serial killer \\"Buffalo Bill\\" kidnaps his victims by asking them for help loading something heavy into his van, and then knocking them out in a surprise attack from behind. Jenna tells Liz that as a result of her relationship with Franco, gossip blogs have dubbed them \\"James\\", a combination of Jenna and James. Jack has Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden) check Nancy's status on the social-networking site YouFace which shows she is on vacation. YouFace is similar to MySpace and Facebook. Randy tells Liz that growing up the (fictitious) small town of Methenburg, Pennsylvania was difficult as a closeted gay man, and reveals that the local television station in the state edited Will & Grace down so much that it was just called Karen. Will & Grace, a former NBC program, revolved around a gay man (Will) and his best friend (Grace), and Karen was Will and Grace's friend. In \\"Klaus and Greta\\", Franco starts a fraudulent romance with Jenna in order to dismiss rumors that he is in love with a Japanese body pillow. According to a CNN report, following the broadcast, the subplot of Franco in love with a body pillow came straight from an article from The New York Times Magazine, published in July 2009, in which the article, deemed controversial, focused on a man in his mid-thirties who carries around a body pillow printed with an animated Japanese female character. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Klaus and Greta\\" was watched by 5.122 million households, according to the Nielsen Media Research. It received a 2.3 rating/6 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, that is 2.3% of all people in that group, and 6% of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. This was a decrease from the December 10, 2009, episode \\"Secret Santa\\", which was watched by 7.54 million American viewers. In the 9:00 p.m. timeslot on January 14, in which this episode aired out of its usual timeslot, 30 Rock was outperformed by CBS' crime drama series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, ABC's medical drama Grey's Anatomy, and Fox's science fiction series Fringe. \\"Klaus and Greta\\" outperformed a repeat of the paranormal drama television series Supernatural on The CW, which drew 1.364 million viewers. This episode of 30 Rock won the award for Outstanding Individual Episode (in a series without a regular gay character) at the 22nd GLAAD Media Awards. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger said that the episode and \\"Black Light Attack!\\" were filled with \\"enough good gags that, together, they made for a very satisfying hour of comedy.\\" Robert Canning of IGN gave this episode a 9.5 out of 10 rating, observing that \\"...it will be a long time before we see anything funnier from 30 Rock\\". Canning said that despite the Tracy character not having too much screen time here \\"his bits were funny, and his idea to add a woman to his entourage had a lot of potential\\", and noted that Liz/Randy's plot ended \\"brilliantly\\" when the story crossed over to Jenna/James Franco's storyline. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave it a positive review writing it was a \\"good episode\\", and \\"[n]ot one of the best but it still had enough funny situations\\", and thanked NBC for broadcasting two episodes. Entertainment Weekly's Margaret Lyons remarked that the two episodes were terrific, and what stood out from both airings \\"was how much serialized plot[s] these two eps covered ... For a show that's usually so episodic, it was an interesting‚Äîtotally successful‚Äîchange of pace.\\" The A.V. Club's Emily VanDerWerff was positive, but noted that \\"there was stuff that didn't work here\\", citing the long scene with Jack and Kenneth in Nancy's home, reasoning it was \\"weirdly boring\\". VanDerWerff was complimentary towards James Franco's appearance, and commented that the idea that Franco was in love with a Japanese body pillow was \\"just comic gold and a half.\\" Not being a fan of Jane Krakowski's Jenna, VanDerWerff noted that \\"Klaus and Greta\\" gave the character \\"one of her best storylines in ages ... [and] everything here about how she slowly grew more and more oblivious was well-done.\\" Sean Gandert for Paste reported that it featured \\"all sorts of funny\\" but felt that the main plot fell \\"pretty flat.\\" Gandert was favorable to the other stories featured here. Time contributor James Poniewozik opined Franco threw himself into the role \\"willing to appear ridiculous and a little crazy\\". Poniewozik said it was a \\"pleasure\\" to see a \\"desperate-Jenna plot\\" that seemed \\"fresh.\\" Nick Catucci, a contributor of New York magazine, deemed this episode of 30 Rock \\"terrific\\".

Plot Romeo, A.K.A. Kosuke Matsuyama (Shun Shioya), is a second-year high school student. A nice, normal, nonviolent type, he suddenly finds himself in the middle of a rampaging crowd of Korean boys, outraged by insults perpetrated by several of his idiotic classmates on two Korean girls. He makes a narrow escape, but soon after, he and his best bud Yoshio (Keisuke Koide) are sent by their home-room teacher to invite the Korean students to a friendly soccer game as a way of restoring the peace. Trembling like black-uniformed leaves, they enter enemy territory, where Kosuke encounters a doll-faced, but serious-looking girl (Erika Sawajiri) playing a Korean folk song, \\"Imjin River,\\" on a flute. He and Yoshio are also nearly lynched by her older brother Lee Ang Son (Sosuke Takaoka) and his gang, but he is already smitten‚Äîand eager to learn that haunting tune. The story concentrates on Kosuke's struggle to not only master a song, but win the love of a girl who seems to live in an alien, hostile world. Meanwhile, Ang Son and his crew are street-fighting with Japanese toughs as if playing a contact sport, with one side scoring hits, then the other. He is macho to a fault, but when he learns that his sweet-heart (Kyoko Yanagihara) is pregnant and determined to keep the baby, he faces a choice that makes him quail: grow up or cop out.

However, none of the tracks from the 1973 reunion album were included on History of The Byrds, due to that album having appeared on Asylum Records rather than on Columbia. At the time of its release, History of The Byrds was the most comprehensive overview of the band's recorded output available. Every variation of the Byrds' ever changing lineup is represented within the album's song selection and as such, it provides a survey of the band's musical journey from their days as folk rock and psychedelic rock pioneers through to their later exploration of country rock. Many of the band's biggest selling singles are included, along with a number of their best known album tracks. Consequently, the album includes musical contributions from all of the key players in the Byrds' convoluted history, including Gene Clark, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, Gram Parsons, Clarence White, and the group's only consistent member, Roger McGuinn. The album's front cover made use of a David Gahr photograph featuring the last lineup of the Byrds to be represented on the album: Roger McGuinn, Skip Battin, Gene Parsons, and Clarence White. The same photograph had already been used for the cover of the U.S. compilation album The Best of The Byrds: Greatest Hits, Volume II just six months earlier. The back cover included liner notes by Kim Fowley and the inside gatefold sleeve of the double vinyl LP featured Pete Frame's \\"Byrds Family Tree\\". This intricately detailed flowchart traced the group's roots and complicated membership history over the years. The very first pressing of this double LP mentioned the Byrds English fan club's (run by Chrissie Oakes) name and address in the middle of the family tree. Despite being one of the band's biggest selling compilations in Europe, History of The Byrds went out of print in the early 1990s and has never been released on CD.

Bush, to aid the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The organization was formed in response to the request of President Barack Obama for the former Presidents to assist in the Haitian rescue effort. The fund concluded formal operations on December 31, 2012. The Clinton Bush Haiti Fund's efforts focused primarily on longer-term reconstruction, especially supporting job creation, workforce development, and the promotion of economic opportunity. The fund's stated purpose was to support the restart, expansion and creation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, to which women are often key contributors; empower people and enterprises by helping them access the formal business sector; promote job creation (particularly jobs with direct social benefit, such as in health and education); and to provide life skills and job training, especially to youth, so that Haitians can embrace economic opportunity. Board of directors On March 5, 2010, a six-member board with two co-chairs, and a CEO, were announced: * Co-chair Laura Graham, a former Clinton administration official and Chief Operating Officer for the Clinton Foundation. * Co-chair Joshua Bolten, former White House Chief of Staff to President Bush and currently a visiting professor at Princeton University‚Äôs Woodrow Wilson School. * Bruce Lindsey, a former Clinton administration official and currently Chief Executive Officer of the Clinton Foundation. * Bill Frist, former US Senate Majority Leader (R-TN) and currently teaching, business and non-profit activities. *Henrietta Fore, former Administrator of the US Agency for International Development under President Bush and currently chairman and CEO of Holsman International, an investment and management company. * Alexis Herman, former Secretary of Labor during President Clinton's administration and currently chief executive officer of New Ventures, LLC.

Donations and grants  US President Barack Obama discussing the earthquake with former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton The Clinton Bush Haiti fund raised $54.4 million from more than 2,000,000 individuals, businesses, and organizations. It dispersed funds to more than 50 organizations through grants, loans, and equity investments. As of December 2012, the Fund estimated that its programs sustained or created 7,350 jobs, trained 20,050 individuals, and had an additional positive impact on the conditions of more than 311,000 Haitians. Key focus areas for funding included providing small and growing businesses with access to financing, business services, and entrepreneurship training (36%); facilitating job training and workforce development (31%); responding to critical, unmet needs (23%); and supporting the recovery and expansion of microfinance institutions, many of whose beneficiaries are women (10%). After the Fund ceased formal operations on December 31, 2012, the Multilateral Investment Fund, a member of the Inter-American Development Bank Group, took over management of programs which had not yet been fully completed and began receiving funds from remaining loans. They are charged with reinvesting loan repayments into programs consistent with the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund's mission of promoting economic opportunity in Haiti.

History For many years the two constituents of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) - the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) and the South Eastern Railway (SER) - had both favoured the 0-4-4T wheel arrangement for suburban and stopping passenger trains. The SER's most recent design was James Stirling's Q class 0-4-4T, which had been produced between 1881 and 1897, whereas the LCDR had the more modern R class 0-4-4T of William Kirtley's design, which dated from 1891. When more 0-4-4T engines were required soon after the formation of the SECR in 1899, the company had two options: to build more of either or both of the existing designs, or to produce a new design. It was intended that a range of standard designs would be produced which would be suitable for use across the whole SECR system, however until these were ready, it was decided to order more of the LCDR's existing R class design, but with modifications. Numbering Fifteen of these locomotives were built by Sharp, Stewart & Co in 1900; their SECR numbers were 696‚Äì710 ‚Äì nos. 696‚Äì705 were for use on the former LCDR routes, whilst nos. 706‚Äì710 were for the old SER system. Originally they were included in the R class, but were separated into a new R1 class in January 1901. No more were built, because by the time that further 0-4-4Ts were required, Wainwright's H class design was ready; it owed much to the R1 class. ;Renumbering The R1 class locos were renumbered three times: to A696-710 by the Southern Railway (SR) from 1923; to 1696-1710 by the SR from 1931; and to 31696-31710 by British Railways from 1948.

M√ºnden railway (also known along with a portion of the Hanoverian Southern Railway as the Halle-Kasseler Eisenbahn‚ÄîHalle-Kassel railway) is a 218 km long main line operated by the Deutsche Bahn in Germany, which links Halle (Saale) in Saxony-Anhalt with Hann. M√ºnden in the state of Lower Saxony. It is mainly used by regional and east-west goods trains. From 1990 to 1994 it was upgraded as part of a German Unification Transport Project.  Route  In the summer of 2007, a Regionalexpress service crosses the former Inner German Border which ran along the stream in the foreground. Halle Hauptbahnhof; trains between Sangerhausen and Kassel run on the west side (right). Kassel Hbf ‚Äì view of the platform; the trains to and from Eichenberg generally run on the north side (tracks 7 to 13). The railway line climbs out of Halle to Lutherstadt Eisleben in the Mansfelder Land. Near Blankenheim it passes through the only tunnel on the route. From there the railway descends again until it reaches the Goldene Aue near Sangerhausen, a plain between the Harz mountains and the Kyffh√§user hills. At the western end of the hill range the railway reaches the Thuringian town of Nordhausen. From here it climbs again, grazes Bleicherode, and crosses the Eichsfeld passing through Leinefelde and Heilbad Heiligenstadt. Near Eichenberg it switches from the valley of the Leine to that of the river Werra and follows it as far as Hann. M√ºnden in Lower Saxony. From here it runs along the Fulda to Kassel. The main station is a terminus with its approach from the west; as a result the line has to loop around the northern part of the city. The line is very winding. From Witzenhausen Nord to Kassel Hauptbahnhof it is almost 42 km long whereas the distance as the crow flies is just 26 km. Until electrification goods trains were pushed up the inclines on both sides of the Blankenheim Tunnels (on the Blankenheimer Ramp or Riestedt Ramp). For that purpose locomotives were stabled in the Bahnbetriebswerk at R√∂blingen am See for 120 years. History Heiligenstadt station Near Arenshausen a dirt road runs under two lines. In front is the line that ran between 1867 and 1884 to Friedland, behind is the line opened in 1872 to Eichenberg  Planning and opening  Already during the planning of the Thuringian Railway in 1838, a route via Nordhausen was discussed, but it was dropped in favour of the route via Erfurt. Despite considerable pressure from the region, no progress was made until an agreement was reached in 1862 between the Prussian government and the Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway Company (Magdeburg-Leipziger Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft), providing for the construction of a line from Halle to Heiligenstadt. While Kassel was the goal, the continuation of the line remained controversial, especially the best route through the Werra and Fulda valleys running through the Kingdom of Hanover. Prussia was interested in a direct connection to Kassel, which did not rely on the Thuringian Railway Company. In January 1863, a concession was formally granted and shortly afterwards construction began. On 1 September 1865 the line was opened from Halle via Eisleben to Sangerhausen and it was extended to Nordhausen on 10 July 1866 and via Leinefelde and Heiligenstadt to Arenshausen on 9 July 1867. After the annexation of Hanover as a result of the War of 1866, Prussia instructed the railway company to build a route via Gro√üalmerode, Helsa and Kaufungen through the Kaufungen Forest to give access to its glass factories and mines. That would have required a costly and steep route. The railway company resisted and originally built only a connection via Friedland to G√∂ttingen (opened on 1 August 1867), connecting to the Hanoverian Southern Railway, which provided a connection to Kassel, all other work was delayed. In 1869, the railway company opened a connection from Arenshausen via Eichenberg, Witzenhausen Nord (above the city and on the other side of the Werra) and Hedem√ºnden to Hann. M√ºnden. The Hanoverian Southern Railway was rebuilt from there to Kassel with two tracks. This work was completed on 13 March 1872.  Development up to 1945  Traffic grew rapidly. After a few years, several connecting lines were opened. In 1869, the South Harz Railway opened between Nordhausen and Northeim and the Nordhausen-Erfurt Railway opened between Wolkramshausen and Erfurt. In 1870, the Gotha‚ÄìLeinefelde railway opened. In 1876, the Bebra‚ÄìG√∂ttingen line (later part of the North‚ÄìSouth railway) was completed from Friedland to Eschwege and Bebra, crossing in Eichenberg. On 1 June 1876, the line was nationalised, as part of the line was included in the project to build a line from Berlin to Metz, the Cannons Railway (Kanonenbahn).No. 14\\\\. Provinzial-Correspondenz. Vierzehnter Jahrgang. 5 April 1876, Textinhalt, Scan This strategic railway used the Halle-Kassel line between Blankenheim and Leinefelde. On 15 April 1879, the Berlin-Blankenheim railway was opened from Berlin-Grunewald via G√ºsten (which was connected to Magdeburg via the Sch√∂nebeck‚ÄìG√ºsten railway) to a junction east of the Blankenheim Tunnel. In 1879, this was supplemented by a link from Sangerhausen and Erfurt. From Leinefelde the Cannons Railway used the line towards Gotha. The development of the Halle‚ÄìKassel line was motivated not only by militarily considerations but also as a means of putting pressure on the Thuringian Railway, leading to its nationalisation between 1882 and 1886. In 1884, the Arenshausen-Friedland link (which had been superseded by the Bebra‚ÄìG√∂ttingen line connection at Eichenberg) was abandoned. Together, the South Harz, the Solling and the Altenbeken‚ÄìKreiensen lines created a major east-west freight route between Nordhausen and Halle. As a result, a little less traffic ran from Magdeburg and Halle via Nordhausen and Kassel to Frankfurt. Passenger services for example on the Leinefelde‚ÄìEichenberg section in the summer of 1939 consisted on weekdays of four pairs of express trains, five pairs of semi-fast (Eilzug) trains and ten pairs of stopping trains. Near the southern Harz, the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp was established to the northwest of Nordhausen in 1943; it was attached to vast underground weapons factories. To remove through traffic from this area, construction was begun on a connecting line from the South Harz line near Osterhagen to the Halle‚ÄìKassel line between Nordhausen and Werther. The construction of this Helme Valley Railway (Helmetalbahn) cost the life of several hundred forced labourers. It was never completed and its route was disrupted in 1945 by the inner German border. Remnants of its embankments and bridges are still visible today. Sangerhausen station, rebuilt cheaply in 1964 after being damaged in the Second World War In the last years of the war the line was overloaded with armaments and military traffic, but also with trains carrying prisoners. Maintenance was largely abandoned. In the air raid on Kassel on 22 October 1943, the central station was destroyed. Halle (Saale) Hauptbahnhof was severely damaged on 31 March 1945. German troops blew up the Fulda and Werra bridges in early April during their retreat. On 7 April, an ammunition train exploded in Sangerhausen station. Ten days later the entire area of the line was occupied by the Americans. Later in May, traffic resumed on sections of the line.  Separation 1945  With the division of Germany into occupation zones the railway was interrupted between Arenshausen and Eichenberg. The last train crossed the future border on 24 July 1945, when U.S. troops handed Thuringia over to the Red Army. In subsequent years, released prisoners of war and \\"displaced persons\\" took the train to Arenshausen, from where they had to walk to the local border transit camp at Friedland. By 1952 there were repeated efforts to reopen the line. Instead, the border became increasingly hard to cross. From 1952 Arenshausen station was in the \\"exclusion zone\\", trains ran through it, but it could only be used with special permission. The tracks between Arenshausen and Eichenberg had been dismantled.  Reconstruction and further development in the East Germany  Nordhausen station Until 1947, the second track was largely dismantled for reparations to the Soviet Union, but it was largely restored from Halle to Sangerhausen by 1954. In 1965, the line near Berga-Kelbra was relocated for the new Kelbra Dam on the Helme. Potash mining and the newly formed cement industry in Deuna led to the duplication of the line at Sollstedt in 1979. Freight transport grew more intense. In 1986, it was decided to electrify the line from Halle to Leinefelde. This began in January 1989 and was completed in 1993.  Reconstruction and further development in West Germany  Cantus EMUs. The station was closed with the opening of the high-speed line, but it was later reopened. The bridges over the Fulda near Ihringshausen and the Werra near Hedem√ºnden were destroyed, but a single track was already back in operation in August 1945; two tracks were restored in 1949. The line has been electrified since 25 September 1964. At the same time, Eichenberg station was rebuilt and the exit towards Halle was temporarily closed. Until the opening of the Hanover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg high-speed railway, the western section of the Halle-Kassel line was served by shuttle trains running between Kassel and an interchange at G√∂ttingen station, while intercity services trains took the direct route from Bebra to G√∂ttingen, bypassing Kassel. In connection with the building of high- speed line, there were plans for the Eichenberg‚ÄìKassel line to be reduced to a single track. During the construction of high-speed line, the Halle‚ÄìKassel railway was relocated in the Fuldatal-Ihringshausen and Vellmar area. The community of Fuldatal ultimately succeeded after years of litigation with Deutsche Bundesbahn in having their station re-opened.  German Unity Transport Project  Reconstruction of the Arenshausen‚ÄìEichenberg section in April 1990 Eichenberg station with Regional-Express to Halle (2007). Only the three tracks to the right run to the east. Arenshausen station has been dowgraded to a halt, the platform serving trains to Heiligenstadt is further east. During the division of Germany there was a much longer platform between the tracks for border controls. In 1989, it was decided to reopen the Arenshausen‚ÄìEichenberg section. Construction began as soon as January 1990. This included the upgrading of both stations with platforms for long trains (476 m in Eichenberg). During the reconstruction of the railway track there was the oddity that the Eastern and Western railway companies, both restored their respective right track first, which failed to meet at the border. On the eastern side the second track was restored a few weeks later. The infrastructure was consistently in place on 3 May 1990, trains were able to run on 26 May and on 30 June passport and customs controls were established. In Eichenberg the platform of the line to Halle was rebuilt east of the existing track field. The single-track connection on the southwest exit was re-opened as an at-grade connection. This clearly limits the performance of the line. Traffic to Kassel from the North-South line runs over a grade- separated route, while traffic from Leinefelde to Kassel either has to run on the left or has to cross the complete track field. In 1991, the German Unity transport projects (Verkehrsprojekte Deutsche Einheit) were approved. These included the upgrading of the Eichenberg‚ÄìHalle line. ‚Ç¨268 million was spent up to 1994 on the duplication of the line, its upgrading and electrification. The electrification between Halle and Bernterode West junction was part of a project started by the East German railways in January 1989, which was completed and continued to Eichenberg. In parallel, the South Harz Autobahn was built for ‚Ç¨1.4 billion, crossing the railway line five times between Bleicherode and Wallhausen. In 1998, a connection curve was opened to the northeast of Eichenberg, allowing trains to run directly between Erfurt/Halle and G√∂ttingen. An InterRegio service on the Halle‚ÄìKassel‚ÄìFrankfurt route that was introduced in 1993 only lasted two years, as the Hamburg‚ÄìKonstanz IR service took over the route over the high-speed line. In 2003 Interconnex (a subsidiary of Veolia Verkehr) operated a service on the Rostock‚ÄìBerlin‚ÄìHalle‚ÄìKassel‚ÄìCologne and Neuss route, but only for a few months. Since then, only freight and regional passenger trains have operated regularly on the line. At the timetable change on 9 December 2007, Gernrode station was formally renamed Gernrode-Niederorschel station.  Further Plans  Rail triangle near Eichenberg: trains from Halle‚ÄìArenshausen run on the right to Friedland‚ÄìG√∂ttingen and on the left to Eichenberg‚ÄìKassel. In the background there is a Cantus EMU from G√∂ttingen to Fulda. In the next few years, no further upgrades are to be expected, but the line will gradually be fitted with electronic interlockings. The line has still not been fitted with the Linienzugbeeinflussung train protection system. In addition, east of Leinefelde, especially between Sangerhausen and Angersdorf, significant reconstruction is necessary and trains currently often have to slow down to 50 km/h. In the public transport plan of Saxony-Anhalt, an upgrade of this line to 140 km/h is required and the state hopes to improve facilities for freight traffic. In the \\"other requirements\\" section of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan), a connection would be provided from the line at Speel to Espenau-M√∂nchehof on the Kassel‚ÄìWarburg line, connecting to the Ruhr, in order to save freight trains a reversal in Kassel. There are regular requests for the reconstruction of Eichenberg station in the layout it had up to 1954.  Current operations  Regional-Express to Halle leaves Kassel-Wilhelmsh√∂he, running on the high-speed line (left) as far as Ihringshausen. Ihringshausen station and junction with freight train towards Eichenberg. The outer tracks are the Halle-Kassel line, the inner tracks are the Hanover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg high-speed line ICE to Dresden leaving Leinefelde  Passengers  The entire line is served by a Kassel‚ÄìHalle Regional-Express every two hours; all other services only use sections of the route. The G√∂ttingen‚ÄìHeiligenstadt-Gotha-Erfurt‚ÄìGera‚ÄìChemnitz, Nordhausen‚ÄìErfurt and Magdeburg‚ÄìErfurt Regional-Express services also run every two hours, as does the Kassel‚ÄìHeiligenstadt‚ÄìErfurt service of the Erfurter Bahn. Since the timetable change on 13 December 2009, the Intercity service, Kyffh√§user, runs on Friday from Frankfurt via Halle to Leipzig, returning on Sunday. These services are supplemented by Regionalbahn services, consisting of class 143 locomotives with double-deck carriages. In Halle the line to Kassel runs next to the tracks of the S-Bahn; they use the same tracks on the bridge over the Saale. The Halle‚ÄìNordhausen line is operated by an hourly Regionalbahn service, called the Kupfer-Express (copper express) in commemoration of the region‚Äôs mining tradition. The Nordhausen‚ÄìLeinefelde Regionalbahn service runs approximately every hour; these services run every two hours to Heiligenstadt, so that with the railcars of the Erfurter Bahn there is an approximately hourly service. From Heiligenstadt to Eichenberg there are only the Regional- Express service and the Erfurter Bahn service. The Eichenberg‚ÄìKassel section is served by electric multiple units on the Kassel‚ÄìG√∂ttingen route. This service, along with the Regional-Express service, run to Kassel Hauptbahnhof, all other services run to Kassel-Wilhelmsh√∂he station. Services between Kassel and G√∂ttingen are operated by Cantus Verkehrsgesellschaft.  Freight  The entire line is a busy line for freight. Thus, the division of labour that prevailed before 1945 has been restored on the main routes between the Harz and the Thuringian Forest: freight trains run via Sangerhausen and Nordhausen, while fast passenger services run via Bebra and Erfurt (the Thuringian Railway). Further growth is affected by the poor connections in Eichenberg and the need for traffic to and from the Ruhr to reverse in Kassel.

European-American Little Falls was originally settled by German Palatine immigrants and their descendants. Later settlers also were of Dutch, English, and Scots-Irish descent, and often belonged to Protestant reform and Congregational traditions. The oldest families from the colonial era often also had Mohawk people ancestry, as this people historically occupied much of the Mohawk Valley and traded with new immigrants. A quarter century after the war, the American Episcopal church had attracted more members, and its congregations built numerous churches in upstate towns.

The energies available are fairly low, in the range of single joules, the voltages range in tens of kilovolts to over 100 kV, and the powers range in hundreds of kilowatts to megawatts. They are suitable for delivering high voltage pulses to high-impedance loads and can directly drive radiating circuits. ECFEGs operate by releasing the electrical charge stored in the poled crystal structure of a suitable ferroelectric material, e.g. PZT, by an intense mechanical shock. They are a kind of phase transition generators. The structure of an EDFEG is generally a block of a suitable high explosive, accelerating a metal plate into a target made of ferroelectric material. FEGs find multiple uses due to their compact character; charging banks of capacitors, initiation of slapper detonator arrays in nuclear weapons and other devices, driving nuclear fusion reactions, powering pulsed neutron generators, seed power sources for stronger pulse generators (e.g. EPFCGs), electromagnetic pulse generators, electromagnetic weapons, vector inversion generators, etc. A 2.4 megawatt HERF generator (an EDFEG with a pulse forming network directly driving a dipole antenna) with peak output frequency at 21.4 MHz was demonstrated.

She is particularly associated with Benjamin Britten who wrote his song cycle, A Charm of Lullabies, and the role of Nancy in his opera Albert Herring for her. Biography Evans was born in Liverpool and educated at Calder High School for Girls there. After studying singing first with John Tobin and later with Maggie Teyte and Eva de Reusz, she made her recital debut in Liverpool at the age of 18. In or before 1936 she took the part of Dido in the premiere recording of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas with Roy Henderson as Aeneas, under Boyd Neel.(Purcell Society recording): R.D. Darrell, Gramophone Shop Encyclopedia of Recorded Music, (New York 1936). Initially a recital and concert singer, she made her stage debut in 1938 in Arthur Sullivan's The Rose of Persia at the Prince's Theatre in London, which was followed by a series of small roles at Royal Opera House. During World War II, she sang throughout Europe and the Middle East in ENSA concerts for the British armed forces. After the war ended, she joined Benjamin Britten's newly formed English Opera Group. Her first important opera role was Lucretia in the 1946 Glyndebourne production of Britten's The Rape of Lucretia. The following year she created the role of Nancy in his Albert Herring, also at Glyndebourne, and in 1948 she sang Polly in Britten's version of The Beggar's Opera. After her retirement, Evans taught singing at the Britten-Pears School in Snape Maltings, and was made an OBE in 1991. She died in Aldeburgh at the age of 85. Personal life  Her first husband was the record producer Walter Legge, whom she married in 1941. The couple had one daughter, born in 1942, but divorced in 1948. In 1949, Evans married the producer and librettist Eric Crozier, who became a co- founder of the Aldeburgh Festival with Britten and Peter Pears.

Alpha case is hard and brittle, and tends to create a series of microcracks which will reduce the metal's performance and its fatigue properties. Alpha case can be minimized or avoided by processing titanium at very deep vacuum levels. However once present on the surface, the currently applied method to remove the Alpha case is by the subtractive methods of machining and /or chemical milling. An emerging technique is to subject the metal to an electrochemical treatment in molten salts, such as calcium chloride or lithium chloride at elevated temperatures. This method, as proven in laboratory, is effective in removal of the dissolved oxygen from the alpha case, and hence recovery of the metal. However, the unwanted consequence of the high temperature treatment is the growth of the grains in the metal. Grain growth may be limited by lowering the molten salt temperature. Alternatively, the metal may be rolling-pressed again to break the large grains into smaller ones References Category:Titanium Category:Metallurgy ","title":"Alpha case"},{"id":"25828381","title":"Gypsy (Shakira song)"},{"id":"25828387","text":"The Naked Wine Show is an award-winning wine review web series hosted by Susan Sterling, developed by Timothy Troke, produced by Anastasia 'Nat' Tubanos and directed by film director Matt Campagna under the production company Frogwater Media.

The film is based on the 1928 play Olympia by Ferenc Moln√°r. Olympia as produced on Broadway, Empire Theatre, October 16, 1928 to November 1928; IBDb.com His Glorious Night has gained notoriety as the film that reputedly began Gilbert's rapid career decline by revealing that he had a voice unsuitable for sound. However, subsequent research suggests that an old fashioned script that clung too closely to the conventions of silent film was the more likely culprit. Plot Although being engaged against her will with a wealthy man, Princess Orsolini (Catherine Dale Owen) is in love with Captain Kovacs (John Gilbert), a cavalry officer she is secretly meeting. Her mother Eugenie (Nance O'Neil), who has found out about the affair forces her to dump Kovacs and take part in the arranged marriage. Though not believing her own words, Orsolini reluctantly tells Kovacs she cannot ever fall in love with a man with his social position, being the son of a peasant. Feeling deeply hurt, Kovacs decides to take revenge by indulging in blackmail, spreading a rumor that he is an imposter and a swindler. The queen fears a scandal and invites herself over to his apartment to retrieve any proof of Orsolini and Kovacs' affair, including love letters. In the end, Kovacs agrees on remaining quiet by having Orsolini spend the night with him. True love is finally reconciled.

Retrieved October 18, 2019. Reception The suggestion that Gilbert's vocal performance was so dreadful that it prompted laughter in the audience has long been held as an article of faith in the film world. That tale is thought to have inspired the fictitious film The Duelling Cavalier, which is featured as a central plot element in the 1952 MGM musical comedy Singin' in the Rain. In fact, while reviews of His Glorious Night ranged from tepid to cautiously supportive, Gilbert himself received generally good notices and his voice was judged perfectly adequate, if somewhat studied in tone. Mordaunt Hall, the influential critic for The New York Times, comments in his 1930 review about the star's overall performance, including the quality of his recorded voice: However, in the same review, Hall singles out the film's main flaws, namely its creaky storyline and old-fashioned approach to the material: This approach to love scenes, far more in line with the technique of silent cinema than sound, was criticised in many reviews.Koszarski, R., An evening's entertainment: the age of the silent feature picture, 1915-1928. p.311 One critic even stated, \\"Gilbert will be able to change places with Harry Langdon. His prowess at lovemaking, which has held the stenos breathless, takes on a comedy aspect, that gets the gum chewers tittering at first, then laughing outright at the very false ring of the couple of dozen 'I love you' phrases.\\"Basinger, J., Silent Stars. p.394 The laughter was blamed not on Gilbert's voice but on Willard Mack's \\"overly florid dialogue, which might have been fine as subtitles but sounded downright embarrassing to audiences when spoken by a cast suffering from the stilted direction of a microphone-conscious Lionel Barrymore\\". Rumors of sabotage Some, including Gilbert's own daughter Leatrice Gilbert Fountain,Fountain, Leatrice Gilbert, and Maxim, John B. Dark Star: The Untold Story of the Meteoric Rise and Fall of Legendary Silent Screen Star John Gilbert. New York: St Martins Press, 1985. have blamed MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer for deliberately perpetuating a rumor that Gilbert's voice was unsuitable for sound in order to drive out a star whom he judged to be too expensive, too cocky, and approaching his use-by date. Mayer and Gilbert undoubtedly shared a strong enmity, and according to rumors, Mayer knew that the script was substandard, and deliberately hired an out-of-condition Lionel Barrymore as the director.Fleming, E. J., The fixers: Eddie Mannix, Howard Strickling, and the MGM publicity machine. p.80 As was common at the time, foreign-language versions of a film were not made by dubbing; instead, scenes were reshot either with the original actors reading translations of their lines phonetically or by using other actors fluent in a specific language. In 1930, the French remake Si l'empereur savait √ßa, Spanish remake Olimpia and German remake Olympia were released. All versions received notably better reviews. MGM sold the film's rights to Paramount Pictures. A different film version, based on the original play rather than the 1929 movie, was produced as A Breath of Scandal in 1960.

The Thurn-und- Taxis Post was operated by the Princely House of Thurn and Taxis between 1806 and 1867. The company was headquartered in Regensburg from its creation in 1806 until 1810 when it relocated to Frankfurt am Main where it remained until 1867. The end of the Imperial Reichspost Deutsche Bundespost 1984 stamp commemorating the Kaiserlichen Taxis'schen Post Throughout the course of the 16th century, the Taxis dynasty was entrusted as the imperial courier of the Holy Roman Empire and in the Spanish Netherlands, Spain, and Burgundy. In 1595, Leonhard I von Taxis was the empire's Postmaster General. Beginning in 1615, the office of Postmaster General of the Imperial Reichspost became hereditary under Lamoral I von Taxis. In 1650, the house was permitted with imperial authorization to rename itself from the House of Tassis (Taxis) to the House of Thurn and Taxis (from the French Tour et Taxis). It was able to maintain the Imperial Reichspost in competition with Europe's post offices. Karl Alexander, 4th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, 1827 Due to the 1792‚Äì1802 French Revolutionary Wars and the following 1803‚Äì15 Napoleonic Wars, the Imperial Reichspost gradually lost more and more postal districts during the tenure of Karl Anselm, 4th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, beginning with the Austrian Netherlands, thus depriving the post of important sources of revenue. Upon the death of Karl Anselm on 13 November 1805, the office of Postmaster General was inherited by his son, Karl Alexander, 5th Prince of Thurn and Taxis. After the Peace of Pressburg in December 1805, the operation of the Imperial Reichspost of the Holy Roman Empire was abolished in W√ºrttemberg, which then continued under government control. By contrast, Karl Alexander was granted the postal system in the Kingdom of Bavaria as a fiefdom of the House of Thurn and Taxis on 24 February 1806. On 2 May 1806, an agreement was signed between Karl Alexander and the Grand Duchy of Baden, also instituting its postal system as a fiefdom of the House of Thurn and Taxis. The creation of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806 virtually meant the end of the Holy Roman Empire and thus the end of the Imperial Reichspost and the hereditary office of Postmaster General held by the House of Thurn and Taxis. On 6 August 1806, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor dissolved the empire after the disastrous defeat of the Third Coalition by Napoleon I of France at the Battle of Austerlitz. While the Imperial Reichspost and the office of Postmaster General ceased to exist, Karl Alexander's wife Therese, Princess of Thurn and Taxis was instrumental in negotiating postal agreements with the Confederation of the Rhine and Napoleon, thus preserving the House of Thurn and Taxis postal monopoly as a private company. Members of the Rothschild banking dynasty were involved in funding parts of the system in the last years of the Napoleonic Wars and the immediate years that followed. Thurn-und- Taxis Post Deutsche Bundespost 1952 stamp depicting a Thurn-und-Taxis cariole On 1 August 1808, the Kingdom of Bavaria placed the postal system under its government's control. The Grand Duchy of Baden followed suit on 2 August 1811. After Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg ceded Regensburg to Bavaria in 1810, the House of Thurn and Taxis relocated the headquarters of its postal operations to Frankfurt am Main. After the defeat and exile of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna recognized the postal claims of the House of Thurn and Taxis in several member states of the German Confederation as legitimate. This recognition resulted in Article 17 of the German Federal Act of 8 June 1815 which required states that had established their own postal system, or intended to do so, to give the House of Thurn and Taxis fair compensation for its loss of revenue.Dallmeier, Schad, a. a. O., S. 79, Wortlaut bei Piendl, a. a. O., S. 86. Under the German Federal Act, the postal systems of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the duchies of Nassau, Saxe-Weimar, Saxe- Meiningen, and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the principalities of Reuss and Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, the free cities of Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Bremen, and L√ºbeck, the principalities of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen, Lippe-Detmold and Schaumburg-Lippe were placed under the now privately operated Thurn-und-Taxis Post. The seat of the post's headquarters in Frankfurt am Main was confirmed on 20 May 1816. On 14 May 1816, Karl Alexander entered into a contract with William I, Elector of Hesse to operate the postal system of Hesse-Kassel. Prior to the contract, the Thurn-und-Taxis Post had a 23 January 1814 mutual transportation agreement with Hesse-Kassel's state postal system. On 27 July 1819, the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg transferred the ownership and management of its state postal system to the Thurn-und-Taxis Post due to its inability to pay its compensation owed to the House of Thurn and Taxis. German-Austrian Postal Association Thurn-und-Taxis Post's 1859 15 Kreuzer stamp In 1847, a German postal conference met in Dresden which resulted in the establishment of the German-Austrian Postal Association. The association came into force on 1 July 1850. On 6 April 1850, the Thurn-und- Taxis Post joined the German-Austrian Postal Association, which was greeted with negative reactions from the government of the Kingdom of Prussia. Above all, Otto von Bismarck, as a representative of the German Confederation in Frankfurt am Main, was disparaged. Beginning on 1 January 1852, the Thurn-und- Taxis Post postage stamp was available in two variants: Kreuzer and Groschen. The end of the Thurn-und-Taxis Post After the Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War, the Prussians occupied the Free City of Frankfurt and the Thurn-und-Taxis Post's headquarters. The Thurn-und-Taxis Post transferred its postal system contracts to the Prussian state for the sum of three million Thaler after a contract was signed and ratified on 28 January 1867. The handover of control of the postal system took place on 1 July 1867. The last Post Director General of the Thurn-und-Taxis Post in Frankfurt was Eduard von Schele zu Schelenburg.

He was one of the founders of the Republican Party. Early life Born in Bethany, Pennsylvania, Kellogg moved with his parents to Sauk County, Wisconsin, in 1840. At age 18, he studied law at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In 1852, Kellogg married Adelaide Worthington of Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, they would eventually have five children. In 1857, he was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin and moved to Mauston, Wisconsin, in Juneau County. He was elected District Attorney for Juneau County in 1860, but resigned in April 1861 to enter service with the Union Army in the American Civil War. Civil War Kellogg helped raise Company K, 6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and was commissioned 1st Lieutenant for that Company on May 3, 1861, under Captain Rufus Dawes. Upon their arrival in Washington, D.C., the regiment was organized into a brigade along with three other regiments from Wisconsin and Indiana. Their brigade would later become known as the Iron Brigade, and would be attached to the Army of the Potomac for most of the war. Kellogg was promoted to Captain of Company I in December 1861, and was made an adjutant for the brigade in 1863. He returned to his role with the regiment in 1864. Kellogg was wounded on May 5, 1864, during the Battle of the Wilderness, and was believed dead.Dawes, p. 272; ...we have letters from Washington informing us that Colonel Bragg, Lieutenant Colonel Dawes, and Captain Kellogg of the sixth regiment are killed... He had actually been taken prisoner. He was held in Virginia for a time, then transferred to Georgia. He escaped while en route to Charleston, South Carolina, but was pursued and recaptured. On October 15, while being transferred from Charleston to Columbia, South Carolina, Kellogg escaped again. This time he successfully reached Union forces near Calhoun, Georgia, having traveled 350 miles after his escape. While a prisoner of war, Kellogg had been promoted to Major and then Lieutenant Colonel. In December 1864 he was made Colonel of the 6th Wisconsin Volunteer Regiment. On February 28, 1865, Kellogg was placed in command of the Iron Brigade. He commanded the brigade through the Appomattox Campaign at the close of the war and mustered out in August 1865. He was subsequently given a brevet to Brigadier General in recognition for his service.Quiner, p. 481 Postbellum years After the war, Kellogg moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin, and served as a U.S. Pension Agent for La Crosse from 1866 to 1875. In 1875, Kellogg moved with his family to Wausau, Wisconsin, to return to his law practice. Kellogg remained active with the Republican Party throughout his life, and, in 1878, was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate, defeating Democrat M. H. Wadleigh. Published works Kellogg published articles about his involvement in the Civil War. In 1908, the articles were collected and published by the Wisconsin Historical Commission as Capture and Escape: A Narrative of Army and Prison Life.

They interacted and interbred with the indigenous Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis), which went extinct 40,000 years ago; and from 37,000 years ago onwards, all EEMH descended from a single founder population which contributes ancestry to present-day Europeans. EEMH produced Palaeolithic cultures, the first major one being the Aurignacian, which was succeeded by the Gravettian by 30,000 years ago. The Gravettian split into the Epi- Gravettian in the east and Solutrean in the west, due to major climate degradation during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), peaking 21,000 years ago. As Europe warmed, the Solutrean evolved into the Magdalenian by 20,000 years ago, and these peoples recolonised Europe. The Magdalenian and Epi-Gravettian gave way to Mesolithic cultures as big game animals were dying out and the Last Glacial Period drew to a close. EEMH were anatomically similar to present-day Europeans, but were more robust, having broader and shorter faces, more prominent brow ridges, and bigger teeth. Like present-day East Asians, EEMH had shorter upper jaws, more horizontally oriented cheekbones, and more rectangular eye sockets. The first EEMH would have had dark skin, and natural selection for lighter skin would not begin until 30,000 years ago, and white skin would not become prevalent in Europe until the Bronze Age. Before the LGM, EEMH had overall low population density, tall stature similar to post- industrial humans, expansive trade routes stretching as long as , and hunted big game animals. EEMH had much higher populations than the Neanderthals, possibly due to higher fertility rates; life expectancy for both species was typically under 40. Following the LGM, population density increased as communities travelled less frequently (though for longer distances), and the need to feed so many more people in tandem with the increasing scarcity of big game caused them to rely more heavily on small or aquatic game, and more frequently participate in game drive systems and slaughter whole herds at a time. The EEMH arsenal included spears, spear-throwers, harpoons, and possibly throwing sticks and Palaeolithic dogs. EEMH likely commonly constructed temporary huts while moving around, and Gravettian peoples notably made large huts on the Russian Plain out of mammoth bones. EEMH are well renowned for creating a diverse array of artistic works, including cave paintings, Venus figurines, perforated batons, animal figurines, and geometric patterns. They may have been decorating their bodies with ochre crayons and perhaps tattoos, scarification, and piercings. The exact symbolism of these works remains enigmatic, but EEMH are generally (though not universally) thought to have practiced shamanism, which cave art‚Äîspecifically of those depicting human/animal hybrids‚Äîplayed a central part in. They also wore decorative beads, and plant-fibre clothes dyed with various plant-based dyes, which were possibly used as status symbols. For music, they produced bone flutes and whistles, and possibly also bullroarers, rasps, drums, idiophones, and other instruments. They buried their dead, though possibly only people which had achieved or were born into high status received burial. Remains of Palaeolithic cultures have been known for centuries, but they were initially interpreted in a creationist model, wherein they represented antediluvian peoples which were wiped out by the Great Flood. Following the conception and popularisation of evolution in the mid-to-late 19th century, EEMH became the subject of much scientific racism, as they were viewed as conquerers who took Europe from the racially inferior Neanderthals, and evolved into the many putative present-day \\"subraces\\" of Europe, most notably the \\"Nordic race\\" (that is, pushing Aryan supremacy). Such conceptions of race were overturned by the mid-20th century. During the first-wave feminism movement, there were arguments that EEMH lived in an egalitarian society, and that human society was not inherently patriarchal, but rather female power was stolen by men with the dawn of civilisation and capitalism (Marxist feminism). There was also a push for some matriarchal religion based around the Venus figurines, which, though contested in academia, has fueled the Goddess movement. Chronology Map of the distribution of the main pre-LGM Aurignacian sites. There appear to have been multiple early modern human (Homo sapiens) immigration and disappearance events on the European continent, whereupon they interacted with the indigenous Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis) which had already inhabited Europe for hundreds of thousands of years. In the Middle Palaeolithic, modern humans have been identified 210,000 years ago in Apidima Cave, Greece, and they were replaced by Neanderthals by 170,000 years ago. About 60,000 years ago, marine isotope stage 3 begins, characterised by volatile climatic patterns and sudden retreat and recolonisation events of forestland in way of open steppeland. The earliest indication of Upper Palaeolithic modern human immigration into Europe is the Balkan Bohunician industry beginning 48,000 years ago, likely deriving from the Levantine Emiran industry, and the earliest bones in Europe date to roughly 45‚Äì43 thousand years ago in Bulgaria, Italy, and Britain. It is unclear, while migrating westward, if they followed the Danube or went along the Mediterranean coast. About 45 to 44 thousand years ago, the Proto-Aurignacian culture spread out across Europe, probably descending from the Near Eastern Ahmarian culture. After 40,000 years ago with the onset of Heinrich event 4, the Aurignacian proper evolved perhaps in South-Central Europe, and rapidly replaced other cultures across the continent. This wave of modern humans replaced Neanderthals and their Mousterian culture. In the Danube Valley, the Aurignacian features sites far and few between, compared to later traditions, until 35,000 years ago. From here, the \\"Typical Aurignacian\\" becomes quite prevalent, and extends until 29,000 years ago. The Aurignacian was gradually replaced by the Gravettian culture, but it is unclear when the Aurignacian went extinct because it is poorly defined. \\"Aurignacoid\\" or \\"Epi-Aurignacian\\" tools are identified as late as 18 to 15 thousand years ago. It is also unclear where the Gravettian originated from as it diverges strongly from the Aurignician (and therefore may not have descended from it). Nonetheless, genetic evidence indicates not all Aurignacian bloodlines went extinct. Hypotheses for Gravettian genesis include evolution: in Central Europe from the Szeletian (which developed from the Bohunician) which existed 41 to 37 thousand years ago; or from the Ahmarian or similar cultures from the Near East or the Caucasus which existed before 40,000 years ago. It is further debated where the earliest occurrence is identified, with the former hypothesis arguing for Germany about 37,500 years ago, and the latter Buran-Kaya III rockshelter in Crimea about 38 to 36 thousand years ago. In either case, the appearance of the Gravettian coincides with a significant temperature drop. Also around 37,000 years ago, the founder population of all later EEMH existed, and Europe would remain in genetic isolation from the rest of the world until 14,000 years ago. LGM refugia, c. 20,000 years ago Around 29,000 years ago, marine isotope stage 2 begins and cooling intensifies. This peaked about 21,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when Scandinavia, the Baltic region, and the British Isles were covered in glaciers, and winter sea ice reached the French seaboard. The Alps were also covered in glaciers, and most of Europe was polar desert, with mammoth steppe and forest steppe dominating the Mediterannean coast. Consequently, large swathes of Europe were uninhabitable, and two distinct cultures emerged with unique technologies to adapt to the new environment: the Solutrean in Southwestern Europe which invented brand new technologies, and the Epi-Gravettian from Italy to the Russian Plain which adapted the previous Gravettian technologies. Solutrean peoples inhabited the permafrost zone, whereas Epi-Gravettian peoples appear to have stuck to less harsh, seasonally frozen areas. Relatively few sites are known through this time. The glaciers began retreating about 20,000 years ago, and the Magdalenian appears and recolonises Western and Central Europe (succeeding the Solutrean) over the next couple thousand years. Starting during the Older Dryas roughly 14,000 years ago, Final Magdalenian traditions appear, namely the Azilian, Hamburgian, and Creswellian. During the B√∏lling‚ÄìAller√∏d warming, Near Eastern genes began showing up in the indigenous Europeans, indicating the end of Europe's genetic isolation. Possibly due to the continual reduction of European big game, the Magdalenian and Epigravettian were completely replaced by the Mesolithic by the beginning of the Holocene. Europe was completely re- peopled during the Holocene climatic optimum from 9 to 5 thousand years ago. Mesolithic West European Hunter-Gatherers (WHG) contributed significantly to the present-day European genome, alongside Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) which descended from the Siberian Mal'ta‚ÄìBuret' culture (and split from EEMH before 37,000 years ago). Unlike ANE, the WHG genome is not prevalent on both sides of the Caucasus, and is only seen in any significant measure west of the Caucasus. Most present-day Europeans have a 60‚Äì80% WHG/(WHG+ANE) ratio, and the 8,000 year old Mesolithic Loschbour man seems to have had a similar pattern. Near Eastern Neolithic farmers which split from the European hunter- gatherers about 40,000 years ago started to spread out across Europe starting 8,000 years ago, ushering in the Neolithic with Early European Farmers (EEF). EEF contribute about 30% of ancestry to present-day Baltic populations, and up to 90% in present-day Mediterranean populations. The latter may have inherited WHG ancestry via EEF introgression. The Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG) population identified around the steppes of the Urals also spread eastward, and the Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers appear to be a mix of WHG and EHG. Around 4,500 years ago, the immigration of the Yamnaya and Corded Ware cultures from the eastern steppes brought the Bronze Age, the Proto-Indo- European language, and more or less the present-day genetic makeup of Europeans. Terminology 1916 reconstruction of the elderly Cro-Magnon 1 EEMH have historically been referred to as \\"Cro-Magnons\\" in scientific literature until around the 1990s when the term \\"anatomically modern humans\\" became more popular. The name \\"Cro-Magnon\\" comes from the 5 skeletons discovered by French palaeontologist Louis Lartet in 1868 at the Cro-Magnon rock shelter, Les Eyzies, Dordogne, France, after the area was accidentally discovered while clearing land for a railway station. Fossils and artefacts from the Palaeolithic had actually been known for decades, but these were interpreted in a creationist model (as the concept of evolution had not been coined yet). For example, the Aurignacian Red Lady of Paviland (a young man) from South Wales was described by geologist Reverend William Buckland in 1822 as a citizen of Roman Britain, and subsequent authors contended the skeleton was either evidence of antediluvian (before the Great Flood) people in Britain, or was swept far from the inhabited lands farther south by the powerful floodwaters. Buckland assumed the specimen was a woman because he was adorned with jewellery (shells, ivory rods and rings, and a wolf-bone skewer), and he also stated (possibly in jest) the jewellery was evidence of witchcraft. Around this time, the uniformitarianism movement was gaining traction, headed principally by Charles Lyell, arguing that fossil materials well predated the biblical chronology. Following Charles Darwin's 1859 On the Origin of Species, racial anthropologists and raciologists began splitting off putative subspecies and sub-races of present-day humans based on unreliable and pseudoscientific metrics gathered from anthropometry, physiognomy, and phrenology continuing into the 20th century. This was a continuation of Carl Linnaeus' 1735 Systema Naturae, where he invented the modern classification system, in doing so classifying humans as Homo sapiens with several putative subspecies classifications for different races based on racist behavioural definitions (in accord with historical race concepts): \\"H. s. europaeus\\" (European descent, governed by laws), \\"H. s. afer\\" (African descent, impulse), \\"H. s. asiaticus\\" (Asian descent, opinions), and \\"H. s. americanus\\" (Native American descent, customs). The racial classification system was quickly extended to fossil specimens, including both EEMH and the Neanderthals, after the true extent of their antiquity was recognised. In 1869, Lartet had proposed the subspecies classification \\"H. s. fossilis\\" for the Cro-Magnon remains. Other supposed subraces of the 'Cro-Magnon race' included: \\"H. pre- aethiopicus\\" for a skull from Dordogne which had \\"Ethiopic affinities\\"; \\"H. predmosti\\" or \\"H. predmostensis\\" for a series of skulls from Brno, Czech Republic, purportedly transitional between Neanderthals and EEMH; H. mentonensis for a skull from Menton, France; \\"H. grimaldensis\\" for Grimaldi man and other skeletons near Grimaldi, Monaco; and \\"H. aurignacensis\\" or \\"H. a. hauseri\\" for the Combe-Capelle skull. These 'fossil races', alongside Ernst Haeckel's idea of there being backwards races which require further evolution (social darwinism), popularised the view in European thought that the civilised white man had descended from primitive, low browed ape ancestors through a series of savage races. Prominent brow-ridges were classified as an ape-like trait, and consequently Neanderthals (as well as Aboriginal Australians) were considered a lowly race. These European fossils were considered to have been the ancestors to specifically living European races. Among the earliest attempts to classify EEMH was done by racial anthropologists Joseph Deniker and William Z. Ripley in 1900, who characterised them as tall and intelligent proto-Aryans, superior to other races, who descended from Scandinavia and Germany. Further race theories revolved around progressively lighter, blonder, and superior races (subspecies) evolving in Central Europe and spreading out in waves to replace their darker ancestors, culminating in the \\"Nordic race\\". These aligned well with Nordicism and Pan-Germanism (that is, Aryan supremacy), which gained popularity just before World War I, and was notably used by the Nazis to justify the conquest of Europe and the supremacy of the German people in World War II. Stature was among the characteristics used to distinguish these sub- races, so taller EEMH such as specimens from the French Cro-Magnon, Paviland, and Grimaldi sites were classified as ancestral to the \\"Nordic race\\", and smaller ones such as Combe-Capelle and Chancelade man (also from France) were considered the forerunners of either the \\"Mediterranean race\\" or \\"Eskimoids\\". The Venus figurines, sculptures of pregnant women with exaggerated breasts and thighs, were used as evidence of the presence of the \\"Negroid race\\" in Palaeolithic Europe because they were interpreted as having been based on real women with steatopygia (a condition which causes thicker thighs, common in the women of the San people of Southern Africa) and the hairdos of some are supposedly similar to those seen in Ancient Egypt. By the 1940s, the positivism movement‚Äîwhich fought to remove political and cultural bias from science and had begun about a century earlier‚Äîhad gained popular support in European anthropology. Due to this movement and raciology's associations with Nazism, raciology fell out of practice. Demographics The beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic is thought to have been characterised by a major population increase in Europe, with the human population of Western Europe possibly increasing by a factor of 10 in the Neanderthal/modern human transition. The archaeological record indicates that the overwhelming majority of Palaeolithic people (both Neanderthals and modern humans) died before reaching the age of 40, with few elderly individuals recorded. It is possible the population boom was caused by a significant increase in fertility rates. A 2005 study estimated the population of Upper Palaeolithic Europe by calculating the total geographic area which was inhabited based on the archaeological record; averaged the population density of Chipewyan, H√§n, Hill people, and Naskapi Native Americans which live in cold climates and applied to this to EEMH; and assumed that population density continually increased with time calculated by the change in the number of total sites per time period. They calculated that: from 40‚Äì30 thousand years ago the population was 1,738‚Äì28,359 (average 4,424); from 30‚Äì22 thousand years ago 1,879‚Äì30,589 (average 4,776); from 22‚Äì16.5 thousand years ago 2,313‚Äì37,693 (average 5,885); and 16.5‚Äì11.5 thousand years ago 11,343‚Äì72,635 (average 28,736). Following the LGM, EEMH are thought to have been much less mobile and featured a higher population density, indicated by seemingly shorter trade routes, and indicators of nutritional stress. Biology=Physical attributes Skull of the Abri Pataud woman For 28 modern human specimens from 190‚Äì25 thousand years ago, average brain volume was estimated to have been about , and for 13 EEMH about . In comparison, present-day humans average , which is notably smaller. This is because the EEMH brain, though within the variation for present-day humans, exhibits longer average frontal lobe length and taller occipital lobe height. The parietal lobes, however, are shorter in EEMH. It is unclear if this could equate to any functional differences between present-day and early modern humans. EEMH are physically similar to present-day humans, with a globular braincase, completely flat face, gracile brow ridge, and defined chin. However, the bones of EEMH are somewhat thicker and more robust. Compared to present-day Europeans, EEMH have broader and shorter faces, more prominent brow ridges, bigger teeth, shorter upper jaws, more horizontally oriented cheekbones, and more rectangular eye sockets. The latter three are seen in present-day East Asians. Reconstruction of the 40,000 year old Oase 2 In early Upper Palaeolithic Western Europe, 20 men and 10 women were estimated to have averaged and , respectively. This is similar to post-industrial modern Northern Europeans. In contrast, in a sample of 21 and 15 late Upper Palaeolithic Western European men and women, the averages were and , similar to pre-industrial modern humans. It is unclear why earlier EEMH were taller, especially considering that cold-climate creatures are short-limbed and thus short-statured to better retain body heat. This has variously been explained as: retention of a hypothetically tall ancestral condition; higher-quality diet and nutrition due to the hunting of megafauna which later became extinct; functional adaptation to increase stride length and movement efficiency while running during a hunt; increasing territorialism among later EEMH reducing gene flow between communities and increasing inbreeding rate; or statistical bias due to small sample size or because taller people were more likely to achieve higher status in a group and thus were more likely to be buried and preserved. It was generally assumed that EEMH, like present-day Europeans, were light skinned as an adaptation to absorb vitamin D from the less luminous sun farther north. However, of the 3 predominant genes responsible for lighter skin in present-day Europeans‚ÄîKITLG, SLC24A5, and SLC45A2‚Äîthe latter two, as well as the TYRP1 gene associated with lighter hair and eye colour, experienced positive selection as late as 19 to 11 thousand years ago during the Mesolithic transition. These three became more widespread across the continent in the Bronze Age. The variation of the gene which is associated with blue eyes in present-day humans, OCA2, seems to have descended from a common ancestor about 10‚Äì6 thousand years ago somewhere in Northern Europe. Such a late timing was potentially caused by overall low population and/or low cross-continental movement required for such an adaptive shift in skin, hair, and eye colouration. However, KITLG experienced positive selection in EEMH (as well as East Asians) beginning approximately 30,000 years ago. Genetics While anatomically modern humans have been present outside of Africa during some isolated time intervals potentially as early as 250,000 years ago, present-day non-Africans descend from the out of Africa expansion which occurred around 65‚Äì55 thousand years ago. This movement was an offshoot of the rapid expansion within East Africa associated with mtDNA haplogroup L3. Mitochondrial DNA analysis places EEMH as the sister group to Upper Palaeolithic East Asian groups (\\"Proto-Mongoloid\\"), divergence occurring roughly 50,000 years ago. Initial genomic studies on the earliest EEMH in 2014, namely on the 37,000-year-old Kostenki-14 individual, identified 3 major lineages which are also present in present-day Europeans: one related to all later EEMH; a \\"Basal Eurasian\\" lineage which split from the common ancestor of present-day Europeans and East Asians before they split from each other; and another related to a 24,000-year-old individual from the Siberian Mal'ta‚ÄìBuret' culture (near Lake Baikal). Contrary to this, a 2016 study looking at much earlier European specimens, including Ust'-Ishim and Oase-1 dating to 45,000 years ago, found no evidence of a \\"Basal Eurasian\\" component to the genome, nor did they find evidence of Mal'ta‚ÄìBuret' introgression when looking at a wider range of EEMH from the entire Upper Palaeolithic. They instead concluded that such a genetic makeup in present-day Europeans stemmed from Near Eastern and Siberian introgression occurring predominantly in the Neolithic and the Bronze Age (though beginning by 14,000 years ago), but all EEMH specimens including and following Kostenki-14 contributed to the present- day European genome and were more closely related to present-day Europeans than East Asians. Earlier EEMH (10 tested in total), on the other hand, did not seem to be ancestral to any present-day population, nor did they form any cohesive group in and of themselves, each representing either completely distinct genetic lineages, admixture between major lineages, or have highly divergent ancestry. Because of these, they also concluded that, beginning roughly 37,000 years ago, EEMH descended from a single founder population and were reproductively isolated from the rest of the world. They reported that an Aurignacian individual from Grottes de Goyet, Belgium, has more genetic affinities to the Magdalenian inhabitants of Cueva de El Mir√≤n than to more or less contemporaneous Eastern European Gravettians. Haplogroups identified in EEMH are the patrilineal (from father to son) Y-DNA haplogroups IJ, C1, and K2a; and matrilineal (from mother to child) mt-DNA haplogroup N, R, and U. Y-haplogroup IJ descended from Southwest Asia. Haplogroup I emerged about 35 to 30 ka, either in Europe or West Asia. Mt-haplogroup U5 arose in Europe just prior to the LGM, between 35 and 25 ka. The 14,000 year old Villabruna 1 skeleton from Ripari Villabruna, Italy, is the oldest identified bearer of Y-haplogroup R1b (R1b1a-L754* (xL389,V88)) found in Europe, likely brought in from Near Eastern introgression. The Azilian \\"Bichon man\\" skeleton from the Swiss Jura was found to be associated with the WHG lineage. He was a bearer of Y-DNA haplogroup I2a and mtDNA haplogroup U5b1h. Genetic evidence suggests early modern humans interbred with Neanderthals. Genes in the present-day genome are estimated to have entered about 65 to 47 thousand years ago, most likely in West Asia soon after modern humans left Africa. In 2015, the 40,000 year old modern human Oase 2 was found to have had 6‚Äì9% (point estimate 7.3%) Neanderthal DNA, indicating a Neanderthal ancestor up to four to six generations earlier, but this hybrid Romanian population does not appear to have made a substantial contribution to the genomes of later Europeans. Therefore, it is possible that interbreeding was common between Neanderthals and EEMH which did not contribute to the present-day genome. The percentage of Neanderthal genes gradually decreased with time, which could indicate they were maladaptive and were selected out of the gene pool. Culture There is a notable technological complexification coinciding with the replacement of Neanderthals with EEMH in the archaeological record, and so the terms \\"Middle Palaeolithic\\" and \\"Upper Palaeolithic\\" were created to distinguish between these two time periods. Largely based on Western European archaeology, the transition was dubbed the \\"Upper Palaeolithic Revolution,\\" (extended to be a worldwide phenomenon) and the idea of \\"behavioural modernity\\" became associated with this event and early modern cultures. It is largely agreed that the Upper Palaeolithic seems to feature a higher rate of technological and cultural evolution than the Middle Palaeolithic, but it is debated if behavioural modernity was truly an abrupt development or was a slow progression initiating far earlier than the Upper Paleolithic, especially when considering the non-European archaeological record. Behaviourly modern practices include: the production of microliths, the common use of bone and antler, the common use of grinding and pounding tools, high quality evidence of body decoration and figurine production, long distance trade networks, and improved hunting technology.Bar-Yosef, O & Zilh√£o, J (eds) 2002: Towards a definition of the Aurignacian. Proceedings of the Symposium held in Lisbon, Portugal, June 25‚Äì30. Trabalhos de Arqueologia no 45. 381 pp. PDF In regard to art, the Magdalenian produced some of the most intricate Palaeolithic pieces, and they even elaborately decorated normal, everyday objects. Hunting and gathering It has typically been assumed that EEMH closely studied prey habits in order to maximise return depending on the season. For example, large mammals (including red deer, horses, and ibex) congregate seasonally, and reindeer were possibly seasonally plagued by insects rendering fur sometimes unsuitable for hideworking. There is much evidence that EEMH, especially in Western Europe following the LGM, corralled large prey animals into natural confined spaces (such as against a cliff wall, a cul-de-sac, or a water body) in order to efficiently slaughter whole herds of animals (game drive system). They seem to have scheduled mass kills to coincide with migration patterns, in particular for red deer, horses, reindeer, bison, aurochs, and ibex, and occasionally wooly mammoths. There are also multiple examples of consumption of seasonally abundant fish, becoming more prevalent in the mid-Upper- Palaeolithic. Nonetheless, Magdalenian peoples appear to have had a greater dependence on small animals, aquatic resources, and plants than predecessors, probably due to the relative scarcity of European big game following the LGM (Quaternary extinction event). Post-LGM peoples tend to have a higher rate of nutrient deficiency related ailments, including a reduction in height, which indicates these bands (probably due to decreased habitable territory) had to consume a much broader and less desirable food range to survive. The popularisation of game drive systems may have been an extension of increasing food return. In particularly southwestern France, EEMH depended heavily upon reindeer, and so it is hypothesised that these communities followed the herds, with occupation of the Perigord and the Pyrenees only occurring in the summer. Epi-Gravettian communities, in contrast, generally focused on hunting 1 species of large game, most commonly horse or bison. It is possible that human activity, in addition to the rapid retreat of favourable steppeland, inhibited recolonisation of most of Europe by megafauna following the LGM (such as mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, Irish elk, and cave lions), in part contributing to their final extinction which occurred by the beginning of or well into the Holocene depending on the species. For weapons, EEMH crafted spearpoints using predominantly bone and antler, possibly because these materials were readily abundant. Compared to stone, these materials are compressive, making them fairly shatterproof. These were then hafted onto a shaft to be used as javelins. It is possible that Aurignacian craftsmen further hafted bone barbs onto the spearheads, but firm evidence of such technology is recorded earliest 23,500 years ago, and does not become more common until the Mesolithic. Aurignacian craftsmen produced lozenge-shaped (diamond-like) spearheads. By 30,000 years ago, spearheads were manufactured with a more rounded-off base, and by 28,000 years ago spindle-shaped heads were introduced. During the Gravettian, spearheads with a bevelled base were being produced. By the beginning of the LGM, the spear-thrower was invented in Europe, which can increase the force and accuracy of the projectile. A possible boomerang made of mammoth tusk was identified in Poland (though it may have been unable to return to the thrower), and dating to 23,000 years ago, it would be the oldest known boomerang. Stone spearheads with leaf- and shouldered-points become more prevalent in the Solutrean. Both large and small spearheads were produced in great quantity, and the smaller ones may have been attached to projectile darts. Archery was possibly invented in the Solutrean, though less ambiguous bow technology is first reported in the Mesolithic. Bone technology was revitalised in the Magdalanian, and long-range technology as well as harpoons become much more prevalent. Some harpoon fragments are speculated to have been leisters or tridents, and true harpoons are commonly found along seasonal salmon migration routes. At some point in time, EEMH domesticated the dog, probably as a result of a symbiotic hunting relationship. DNA evidence suggests that present-day dogs split from wolves around the beginning of the LGM. However, potential Palaeolithic dogs have been found preceding this‚Äînamely the 36,000 year old Goyet dog from Belgium and the 33,000 year old Altai dog from Siberia‚Äîwhich could indicate there were multiple attempts at domesticating European wolves. refer Supplementary material Page 27 Table S1 These \\"dogs\\" had a wide size range, from over in height in Eastern Europe to less than 30‚Äì45 cm (1 ft‚Äì1 ft 6 in) in Central and Western Europe, and in all of Europe. These \\"dogs\\" are identified by having a shorter snout and skull, and wider palate and braincase than contemporary wolves. Nonetheless, an Aurignacian origin for domestication is controversial. At the 27 to 24 thousand year old P≈ôedmost√≠ site, Czech Republic, 3 \\"dogs\\" were identified with their skulls perforated (probably to extract the brain), and 1 had a mammoth bone in its mouth. The discoverers interpreted this as a burial ritual. The 14,500 year old Bonn-Oberkassel dog from Germany was found buried alongside a 40 year old man and a 25 year old woman, as well as traces of red hematite, and is genetically placed as an ancestor to present-day dogs. It was diagnosed with canine distemper virus and probably died between 19‚Äì23 weeks of age. It would have required extensive human care to survive without being able to contribute to anything, suggesting that, at this point, humans and dogs were connected by emotional or symbolic ties rather than purely materialistic personal gain. It is hypothesised these proto-dogs provided a vital role in hunting, as well as domestic services such as transporting items or guarding camp or carcasses, but the exact utility of these dogs is unclear. SocietySocial system= The first Venus discovered, the \\"V√©nus impudique\\" (\\"immodest Venus\\"), possibly of a young girl As opposed to the patriarchy prominent in historical societies, the idea of a prehistoric predominance of either matriarchy or a society centred on motherhood was first supposed in 1861 by legal scholar Johann Jakob Bachofen. The earliest models of this believed that monogamy was not widely practiced in ancient times, and the paternal line was resultantly more difficult to keep track of than the maternal, and matriarchal societies were conquered by patriarchs at the dawn of civilisation. The switch from matriarchy to patriarchy was seen as a leap forward. However, when the first Palaeolithic representations of humans were discovered, the so-called Venus figurines‚Äîwhich typically feature pronounced breasts, buttocks, and vulvas (areas generally sexualised in present-day Western Culture)‚Äîthey were initially interpreted as pornographic in nature. The first Venus discovered was named the \\"V√©nus impudique\\" (\\"immodest Venus\\") by the discoverer Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye, because it lacked clothes and had a prominent vulva. The name \\"Venus\\", after the Roman goddess of beauty, in itself implies an erotic purpose. Such a pattern in the representation of the human form led to suggestions that human forms were generally pornography for men, meaning men were primarily responsible for artwork and craftsmanship in the Palaeolithic whereas women were tasked with child rearing and various domestic works. This would equate to a patriarchal social system. The Palaeolithic matriarchy model was adapted by prominent communist Friedrich Engels who instead argued that women were robbed of power by men, due to economic changes which could only be undone with the adoption of communism (Marxist feminism). The former sentiment was adopted by the first-wave feminism movement, who attacked the patriarchy by making Darwinist arguments of a supposed natural egalitarian or matrifocal (mother-centric) state of human society instead of patriarchal, as well as interpreting the Venuses as evidence of mother goddess worship as part of some matriarchal religion. Consequently, by the mid-20th century, the Venuses were primarily interpreted as evidence of some Palaeolithic fertility cult. Such claims died down in the 1970s as archaeologists moved away from the highly theoretical models produced by the previous generation. Through the second-wave feminism movement, the prehistoric matriarchal religion hypothesis was primarily propelled by Lithuanian-American archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. Her interpretations of the Palaeolithic were notably involved in the Goddess movement. Equally ardent arguments against the matriarchy hypothesis have also been prominent, such as American religious scholar Cynthia Eller's 2000 The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory. Looking at the archaeological record, depictions of women are markedly more common than of men. In contrast to the commonplace Venuses in the Gravettian, Gravettian depictions of men are rare and contested, the only reliable one being a fragmented ivory figurine from the grave of a Pavlovian site in Brno, Czech Republic (it is also the only statuette found in a Palaeolithic grave). 2-D Magdalenian engravings from 15 to 11 thousand years ago do depict males, indicated by an erect penis and facial hair, though profiles of women with an exaggerated buttock are much more common. There are less than 100 depictions of males in the EEMH archaeological record (of them, about a third are depicted with erections.) On the other hand, most individuals which received a burial (which may have been related to social status) were men. Anatomically, the robustness of limbs (which is an indicator of strength) between EEMH men and women were consistently not appreciably different from each other. Such low levels of sexual dimorphism through the Upper Pleistocene could potentially mean that sexual division of labour, which characterises historic societies (both agricultural and hunter-gatherer), only became commonplace in the Holocene. =Trading= Perforated Homalopoma sanguineum shells (top and underside views) from Poiana Cire≈üului, Romania, sourced at least away The Upper Palaeolithic is characterised by evidence of expansive trade routes and the great distances at which communities could maintain interactions. The early Upper Palaeolithic is especially known for highly mobile lifestyles, with Gravettian groups (at least those analysed in Italy and Moravia, Ukraine) often sourcing some raw materials upwards of . However, it is debated if this represents sample bias, and if Western and Northern Europe were less mobile. Some cultural practices such as creating Venus figurines or specific burial rituals during the Gravettian stretched across the continent. Genetic evidence suggests that, despite strong evidence of cultural transmission, Gravettian Europeans did not introgress into Siberians, meaning there was a movement of ideas but not people between Europe and Siberia. At the 30,000 year old Romanian Poiana Cire≈üului site, perforated shells of the Homalopoma sanguineum sea snail were recovered, which is significant as it inhabits the Mediterranean at nearest away. Such interlinkage may have been an important survival tool in lieu of the steadily deteriorating climate. Given low estimated population density, this may have required a rather complex, cross- continental social organisation system. By and following the LGM, population densities are thought to have been much higher with the marked decrease of habitable lands, resulting in more regional economies. Decreased land availability could have increased travel distance, as habitable refugia may have been far and few between, and increasing population density within these few refugia would have made long-distance travel less economic. This trend continued into the Mesolithic with the adoption of sedentism. Nonetheless, there is some evidence of long-distance Magdalenian trade routes. For example, at Lascaux, a painting of a bull had remnants of the manganese mineral hausmannite, which can only be manufactured in heat in excess of , which was probably impossible for EEMH; this means they likely encountered natural hausmannite which is known to be found away in the Pyrenees. Unless there was a hausmannite source much closer to Lascaux which has since been depleted, thise could mean that there was a local economy based on manganese ores. Also, at Ekain, Basque Country, the inhabitants were using the locally rare manganese mineral groutite in their paintings, which they possibly mined out of the cave itself. Based on the distribution of Mediterranean and Atlantic seashell jewellery even well inland, there may have been a network during the Late Glacial Interstadial (14 to 12 thousand years ago) along the rivers Rhine and Rh√¥ne in France, Germany, and Switzerland. =Housing= 13,800 year old slab from Mol√≠ del Salt, Spain, with engravings speculated to be huts EEMH cave sites quite often feature distinct spatial organisation, with certain areas specifically designated for specific activities, such as hearth areas, kitchens, butchering grounds, sleeping grounds, and trash pile. It is difficult to tell if all material from a site was deposited at about the same time, or if the site was used multiple times. EEMH are thought to have been quite mobile, indicated by the great lengths of trade routes, and such a lifestyle was likely supported by the constructions of temporary shelters in open environments, such as huts. Evidence of huts is typically associated with a hearth. Magdalenian peoples, especially, are thought to have been highly migratory, following herds while repopulating Europe, and several cave and open-air sites indicate the area was abandoned and revisited regularly. The 19,000 year old Peyre Blanque site, France, and at least the area around it may have been revisited for thousands of years. In the Magdalenian, stone lined rectangular areas typically were interpreted as having been the foundations or flooring of huts. At Magdalenian Pincevent, France, small, circular dwellings were speculated to have existed based on the spacing of stone tools and bones; these sometimes featured an indoor hearth, work area, or sleeping space (but not all at the same time). A 23,000 year old hut from the Israeli Ohalo II was identified as having used grasses as flooring or possibly bedding, but it is unclear if EEMH also lined their huts with grass or instead used animal pelts. A 13,800 year old slab from Mol√≠ del Salt, Spain, has 7 dome-shaped figures engraved onto it, which are postulated to represent temporary dome-shaped huts. Reconstruction of a mammoth hut from Mezhyrich, Ukraine Over 70 dwellings constructed by EEMH out of mammoth bones have been identified, primarily from the Russian Plain, possibly semi- permanent hunting camps. They seem to have built tipis and yarangas. These were typically constructed following the LGM after 22,000 years ago by Epi- Gravettian peoples; the earliest hut identified comes from Moldova, Ukraine, which was dated to 44,000 years ago (making it possible it was built by Neanderthals). Typically, these huts measured in diameter, or if oval shaped. Huts could get as small as . One of the largest huts has a diameter of ‚Äîa 25,000 year old hut identified in Kostenki, Russia‚Äîand was constructed out of 64 mammoth skulls, but given the little evidence of occupation, this is postulated to have been used for food storage rather than as a living space. Some huts have burned bones, which has typically been interpreted as bones used as fuel for fireplaces due to the scarcity of firewood, and/or disposal of waste. A few huts, however, have evidence of wood burning, or mixed wood/bone burning. Mammoth hut foundations were generally made by pushing a great quantity of mammoth skulls into the ground (most commonly, though not always, with the tusks facing up to possibly be used as further supports), and the walls by putting into the ground vertically shoulder blades, pelvises, long bones, jaws, and the spine. Long bones were often used as poles, commonly placed on the end of another long bone or in the cavity of where tusk used to be. Foundation may have extended as far as underground. Generally, multiple huts were built in a locality, placed apart depending on location. Tusks may have been used to make entrances, skins pulled over for roofing, and the interior sealed up by loess dug out of pits. Some architectural decisions seem to have been purely for aesthetics, best seen in the 4 Epi-Gravettian huts from Mezhyrich, Mezine, Ukraine, where jaws were stacked to create a chevron or zigzag pattern in 2 huts, and long bones were stacked to create horizontal or vertical lines in respectively 1 and 2 huts. The chevron seems to have been a commonly used symbol on the Russian Plain, painted or engraved on bones, tools, figurines, and mammoth skulls. ArtCave art= EEMH are well known for having painted or engraved geometric designs, hand stencils, plants, animals, and seemingly human/animal hybrid creatures on cave walls deep inside caves. Typically the same species are represented in caves which have such art, but the total number of species is quite numerous, and namely includes creatures such as mammoths, bison, lions, bears, and ibex. Nonetheless, some caves were dominated by certain forms, Grotte de Niaux where over half of the animals are bison. Images could be drawn on top of one another. They are found in dark cave recesses, and the artists either lit a fire on the cave floor and used portable stone lamps to see. Drawing materials include black charcoal and red and yellow ochre crayons, and these same materials were ground into powder and mixed with water to create paint. Palaeolithic painters made use of a variety of minerals for this purpose. Large, flat rocks may have been used as palettes, and brushes may have included reeds, bristles, and twigs, and possibly a blowgun was used to spray paint over less accessible areas. Hand stencils could either be made by holding the hand to the wall and spitting paint over it (leaving a negative image) or by applying paint to the hand and then sticking it to the wall. Some prints are missing fingers, but it is unclear if the artist was actually missing the finger or simply excluded it from the stencil. It has generally been assume that the larger prints were left by men and the smaller ones by boys, but the exclusion of women entirely may be improbable. Though many hypotheses have been proposed for the symbolism of cave art, it is still debated why these works were created in the first place. When examples of EEMH art were first discovered in the 19th century‚Äîengraved objects‚Äîthey were assumed to have been \\"art for art's sake\\" as Palaeolithic peoples were widely concieved as having been uncultured savages. This model was primarily championed by French archaeologist Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet. Then, detailed paintings found deep within caves were discovered, the first being Cueva de Altamira, Spain, in 1879. The \\"art for art's sake\\" model came apart by the turn of the century as more examples of cave art were found in hard-to-reach places in Western Europe such as Combarelles and Font-de-Gaume, for which the idea of it being simply a leisure activity became increasingly untenable. At this time, one notable hypothesis was forwarded by French religious historian Salomon Reinach who supposed that, because only animals were depicted on cave walls, the images represented totem veneration, in which a group or a group member identifies with a certain animal associated with certain powers, and honours or respects this animal in some way such as by not hunting it. If this were the case, then EEMH communities within a region would have subdivided themselves into, for example, a \\"horse clan\\", a \\"bison clan\\", a \\"lion clan\\", and so forth. This was soon contested as some caves contain depictions of animals wounded by projectiles, and generally multiple species are represented. In 1903, Reinach proposed that the cave art represented sympathetic magic (between the painting and the painting's subject), and by drawing an animal doing some kind of action, the artist believed they were exerting that same action onto the animal. That is, by being the master of the image, they could master the animal itself. The hunting magic model‚Äîand the idea that art was magical and utilitarian in EEMH society‚Äîgained much popularity in the following decades. In this model, herbivorous prey items were depicted as having been wounded prior to a hunt in order to cast a spell over them; some animals were incompletely depicted to enfeeble them; geometric designs were traps; and human/animal hybrids were sorcerers dressed as animals to gain their power, or were gods ruling over the animals. Many animals were depicted as completely healthy and intact, and sometimes pregnant, which this model interprets as fertility magic to promote reproduction; however, if the animal was a carnivore, then this model says that the depiction served to destroy the animal. By the mid-20th century, this model was being contested because of how few depictions of wounded animals exist; the collection of consumed animal bones in decorated caves often did not match types of animals depicted in terms of abundance; and the magic model does not explain hand stencils. Following the 1960s, begun by German-American art historian Max Raphael, the study of cave art took on a much more statistical approach, analysing and quantifying items such as the types and distribution of animals depicted, cave topography, and cave wall morphology. Based on such structuralist tests, horses and bovines seem to have been preferentially clustered together typically in a central position, and such binary organisation led to the suggestion that this was sexual symbolism, and some animals and iconography were designated by EEMH as either male or female. This conclusion has been heavily contested as well, due to the subjective definition of association between two different animals, and the great detail the animals were depicted in, permitting sexual identification (and further, the hypothesis that bison were supposed to be feminine contradicts the finding that many are male). Also in the late 20th century, with the popularisation of the hypothesis that EEMH practised shamanism, the human/animal hybrids and geometrical symbols were interpreted within this framework as the visions a shaman would see while in a trance (entoptic phenomena). Opponents mainly attack the comparisons made between Palaeolithic cultures and present-day shamanistic societies for being in some way inaccurate. In 1988, archaeologists David Lewis-Williams and Thomas Dowson suggested trances were induced by hallucinogenic plants containing either mescaline, LSD, or psilocybine; but the only European plant which produces any of these is ergot (which produces a substance used to make LSD), and there is no evidence EEMH purposefully ate it. =Portable art= Venus figurines are commonly found associated with EEMH and are the earliest well-acknowledged representation of human figures. These are most commonly found in the Gravettian (notably in the French Upper P√©rigordian, the Czech Pavlovian, and West Russian Kostenkian) most commonly from 29 to 23 thousand years ago. Almost all Venuses depict naked women, and are generally hand-held sized, and feature a downturned head, no face, thin arms which end at or cross over the breasts, voluminous breasts and buttocks, a prominent abdomen interpreted as pregnancy, tiny and bent legs, and pegged or unnaturally short feet. Venuses vary in proportions, and it is debated if this is due to material choice or if they were intentional design choices. It is suggested that Eastern European Venuses have an emphasis on the breasts and stomach, whereas Western European ones emphasise the hips and thighs. The earliest interpretations of the Venuses believed these were literal representations of women with obesity or steatopygia (a condition where a woman's body stores more fat in the thighs and buttocks, making them especially prominent). Another early hypothesis was that ideal womanhood for EEMH involved obesity, or that the Venuses were used by men as erotica due to the exaggeration of body parts typically sexualised in Western Culture (as well as the lack of detail to individualising traits such as the face and limbs). However, extending present-day Western norms to Palaeolithic peoples was contested, and a counter interpretation is that either Venuses were mother goddesses, or that EEMH believed depictions of things had magical properties over the subject, and that such a depiction of a pregnant woman would facilitate fertility and fecundity. This is also contested as it assumes women are only thought of in terms of child rearing. EEMH also carved perforated batons out of horn, bone, or stone, most commonly through the Solutrean and Magdalenian. Such batons disappear from the archaeological record at the Magdalenian's close. Some batons seem phallic in nature, and about 60 batons have been hypothesised to be representations of penises (all with erections), of which 30 show decoration, and 23 are perforated. Several phallic batons are depicted as circumcised and seemingly bearing some ornamentation such as piercings, scarification, or tattooing. The purpose of perforated batons has been debated, which suggestions for spiritual or religious purposes, ornamentation or status symbol, currency, drumsticks, tent holders, weaving tools, spear straighteners, spear throwers, or dildos. Unperforated phallic batons, measuring 30 (11.8 in) to a few centimetres long, were quite early on interpreted as sexual toys. Depictions of animals were commonly produced by EEMH. As of 2015, as many as 50 Aurignacian ivory figurines and fragments have been recovered from the German Swabian Jura. Of the discernible figures, most represents mammoths and lions, and a few horses, bison, possibly a rhino, waterfowl, fish, and small mammals. These sculptures are hand-sized and would have portable works, and some figurines were made into wearable pendants. Some figurines also featured enigmatic engravings, dots, marks, lines, hooks, and criss-cross patterns. EEMH also made purely symbolic engravings. There are several plaques of bone or antler (referred to as polishers, spatulas, palettes, or knives) which feature series of equidistantly placed notches, most notably the well-preserved 32,000 year old Blanchard plaque from L'Abri Blanchard, France, which features 24 markings in a seemingly serpentine pattern. These have been speculated to have been an early counting system for tallying items such as animals killed, or some other notation system. Marshack postulated they may be calendars. Also in 1972, Marshack identified Magdalenian plaques from 15 to 13 thousand years bearing small, abstract symbols seemingly into organised blocks or sets, which he interpreted as representing an early writing system. Czech archaeologist Bohuslav Kl√≠ma speculated a complex engraving on a mammoth tusk he discovered in the Gravettian Pavlov site, Czech Republic, as being a map, showing a meandering river centre-left, a mountain centre-right, and a living grounds at the centre indicated by a double circle. A few similar engravings have been identified across Europe (in particular the Russian Plain), which he also postulated were maps, plans, or stories. =Body art= Magdalenian ochre bowl EEMH are commonly associated with large pieces of pigments (\\"crayons\\"), namely made of red ochre. For EEMH, it is typically assumed that ochre was used for some symbolic purposes, most notably for cosmetics such as body paint. This is because ochre in some sites had to be imported from incredibly long distances, and it is also associated with burials. It is unclear why they specifically chose red ochre instead of other colours. In terms of colour psychology, popular hypotheses include the putative \\"female cosmetic coalitions\\" hypothesis and the \\"red dress effect\\". It is also possible that ochre was chosen for its utility, such as an ingredient for adhesives, hide tanning agent, insect repellent, sunscreen, medicinal properties, dietary supplement, or as a soft hammer. EEMH appear to have been using grinding and crushing tools to process ochre before applying it to the skin. In 1962, French archaeologists Saint-Just and Marthe P√©quart identified bi-pointed needles in the Magdalenian Le Mas-d'Azil, which they speculated might have been used in tattooing. Hypothesised depictions of penises from most commonly the Magdalenian (though a few dating back to the Aurignacian) appear to be decorated with tattoos, scarification, and piercings. Designs include lines, plaques, dots or holes, and human or animal figures. =Clothing= EEMH produced beads, which are typically assumed to have been attached to clothing or portable items as body decoration. Beads had already been in use since the Middle Palaeolithic, but production dramatically increased in the Upper Palaeolithic. It is unclear why communities chose specific raw materials over other ones, and they seem to have upheld local bead making traditions for a very long time. For example, Mediterranean communities used specific types of marine shells to make beads and pendants for more than 20,000 years; and Central and Western European communities often used pierced animal (and less commonly human) teeth. In the Aurignacian, beads and pendants were being made of shells, teeth, ivory, stone, bone, and antler; and there are a few examples of use of fossil materials including a belemnite, nummulite, ammonite, and amber. They may have also been producing ivory and stone rings, diadems, and labrets. Beads could be manufactured in numerous different styles, such as conical, elliptical, drop-shaped, disc-shaped, ovoid, rectangular, trapezoidal, and so on. Beads may have been used to facilitate social communication, to display the wearer's socio-economic status, as they could have been capable of communicating labour costs (and thereby, a person's wealth, energy, connections, etc.) simply by looking at them. The distribution of ornaments on buried Gravettian individuals, and the likeliness that most of the buried were dressed with whatever they were wearing upon death, indicates that jewellery was primarily worn on the head as opposed to the neck or the torso. The Gravettian Doln√≠ Vƒõstonice I and III and Pavlov I sites in Moravia, Czech Republic, yielded many clay fragments with textile impressions. These indicate a highly sophisticated and standardised textile industry, including the production of: single-ply, double-ply, triple-ply, and braided string and cordage; knotted nets; wicker baskets; and woven cloth including simple and diagonal twined cloth, plain woven cloth, and twilled cloth. Some cloths appear to have a design pattern. There are also plaited items which may have been baskets or mats. Due to the wide range of textile gauges and weaves, it is possible they could also produce wall hangings, blankets, bags, shawls, shirts, skirts, and sashes. These people used plant rather than animal fibres, possibly nettle, milkweed, yew, or alder which have historically been used in weaving. Such plant fibre fragments have also been recorded at the Russian Kostenki and Zaraysk as well as the German G√∂nnersdorf site. The inhabitants of Dzudzuana Cave, Georgia, appear to have been staining flax fibres with plant-based dyes, including yellow, red, pink, blue, turquoise, violet, black, brown, gray, green, and khaki. Supporting Online Material The emergence of textiles in the European archaeological record also coincides with the proliferation of the sewing needle in European sites. Ivory needles are found in most late Upper Palaeolithic sites, which could correlate to frequent sewing, and the predominance of small needles (too small to tailor clothes out of hide and leather) could indicate work on softer woven fabrics or accessory stitching and embroidery of leather products. There is some potential evidence of simple loom technology. However, these have also been interpreted as either hunting implements or art pieces. Rounded objects made of mammoth phalanges from P≈ôedmost√≠ and Avdeevo, Russia, may have been loom weights or human figures. Perforated, washer-like ivory or bone discs from across Europe were potentially spindle whorls. A foot-shaped piece of ivory from Kniegrotte, Germany, was possibly a comb or a decorative pendant. On the basis of wearing analyses, EEMH are also speculated to have used net spacers or weaving sticks. In 1960, French archaeologist Fernand Lacorre suggested that perforated batons were used to spin cordage. Some Venuses depict hairdos and clothing worn by Gravettian women. The Venus of Willendorf seems to be wearing a cap, possibly woven fabric or made from shells, featuring at least seven rows and an additional two half-rows covering the nape of the neck. It may have been made starting at a knotted centre and spiraling downward from right to left, and then backstitching all the rows to each other. The Kostenki-1 Venus seems to be wearing a similar cap, though each row seems to overlap the other. The Venus of Brassempouy seems to be wearing some nondescript open, twined hair cover. The engraved Venus of Laussel from France seems to be wearing some headwear with rectangular gridding, and could potentially represent a snood. Most East European Venuses with headwear also display notching and checkwork on the upper body which are suggestive of bandeaux (a strip of cloth bordering around the tops of the breasts) with some even featuring straps connecting it to around the neck; these seem to be absent in Western European Venuses. Some also wear belts: in Eastern Europe, these are seen on the waist; whereas in Central and Western Europe they are worn on the low hip. The Venus of Lespugue seems to be wearing a plant fibre string skirt comprising 11 cords running behind the legs. =Music= Aurignacian bone flute from Geissenkl√∂sterle, Germany EEMH are known to have created flutes out of hollow bird bones as well as mammoth ivory, first appearing in the archaeological record with the Aurignacian about 40,000 years ago in the German Swabian Jura. The Swabian Jura flutes appear to have been able to produce a wide range of tones. One virtually complete flute made of the radius of a griffon vulture from Hohle Fels measures in length and in diameter. The bone had been smoothed down and was pierced with holes. These finger holes exhibit cut marks, which could indicate the exact placement of these holes was specifically measured to create concert pitch (that is, to make the instrument in tune) or a scale. The part near the elbow joint had two V-shaped carvings, presumably a mouthpiece. Ivory flutes would have required a great time investment to make, as it requires more skill and precision to craft compared to a bird bone flute. A section of ivory must be sawed off to the correct size, cut in half so it can be hollowed out, and then the two pieces have to be refitted and stuck together by an adhesive in an air-tight seal. EEMH also created bone whistles out of deer phalanges. Such sophisticated music technology could potentially speak to a much longer musical tradition than the archaeological record indicates, as modern hunter-gatherers have been documented to create instruments out of: more biodegradable materials (less likely to fossilise) such as reeds, gourds, skins, and bark; more or less unmodified items such as horns, conch shells, logs, and stones; and their weapons, including spear thrower shafts or boomerangs as clapsticks, or a hunting bow. Potential EEMH instruments: bone flute (left), whistle (centre), idiophone (bottom), and bullroarer (top) It is speculated that a few EEMH artefacts represent bullroarers or percussion instruments such as rasps, but these are harder to prove. One probable bullroarer is identified at Lalinde, France, dating to 14 to 12 thousand years ago, measuring long and decorated with geometric incisions. In the mammoth-bone houses at Mezine, Ukraine, an thigh-bone, a jawbone, a shoulder blade, and a pelvis of a mammoth bear evidence of paint and repeated percussion. These were first proposed by archaeologist Sergei Bibikov to have served as drums, with either a reindeer antler or mammoth tusk fragment also found at the site being used as a drum stick, though this is contested. Other European sites have yielded potential percussion mallets made of mammoth bone or reindeer antler. It is speculated that some EEMH marked certain sections of caves with red paint which could be struck to produce a note that would resonate throughout the cave chamber, somewhat like a xylophone. Language The early modern human vocal apparatus is generally thought to have been the same as that in present-day humans, and the present- day variation of the FOXP2 gene associated with speech and language ability seems to have evolved within the last 100,000 years. These indicate Upper Palaeolithic humans had the same language capabilities and range of potential phonemes (sounds) as present-day humans. Though EEMH languages likely contributed to present-day languages, it is unclear what early languages would have sounded like because words denature and are replaced by entirely original words quite rapidly, making it difficult to identity language cognates (a word in multiple different languages which descended from a common ancestor) which originated before 9 to 5 thousand years ago. Nonetheless, it has been controversially hypothesised that Eurasian languages are all related and form the Nostratic languages with an early common ancestor existing just after the end of the LGM. In 2013, evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel and colleagues postulated that among Nostratic languages, frequently used words more often have speculated cognates, and that this was evidence that 23 identified words were \\"ultraconserved\\" and supposedly changed very little in use and pronunciation, descending from a common ancestor about 15,000 years ago at the end of the LGM. Archaeologist Paul Heggarty said that Pagel's data was subjective interpretation of supposed cognates, and the extreme volatility of sound and pronunciation of words (for example, Latin [akwam] \\"water\\" ‚Üí French [o] in just 2,000 years) makes it unclear if cognates can even be identified that far back if they do indeed exist. ReligionShamanism= Several Upper Palaeolithic caves feature depictions of seemingly part-human, part-animal chimaeras (typically part bison, reindeer, or deer), variously termed \\"anthropozoomorphs\\", \\"therianthropes\\", or \\"sorcerers\\". These have typically been interpreted as being the centre of some shamanistic ritual, and to represent some cultural revolution and the origins of subjectivity. The oldest such cave drawing has been identified at the 30,000 year old Chauvet Cave, where a figure with a bison upper body and human lower body was drawn onto a stalactite, facing a depiction of a vulva with two tapering legs. The 17,000 year old Grotte de Lascaux, France, has a seemingly dead bird-human hybrid between a rhino and a charging bison, with a bird on top of a pole placed near the figure's right hand. A bird on a stick is used as a symbol of mystical power by some modern shamanistic cultures who believe that birds are psychopomps, and can move between the land of the living and the land of the dead. In these cultures, they believe the shaman can either transform into a bird or use a bird as a spirit guide. The 14,000 year old Grotte des Trois- Fr√®res, France, features 3 sorcerers. The so-called \\"The Dancing Sorcerer\\" or \\"God of Les Trois Fr√®res\\" seems to bear human legs and feet, paws, a deer head with antlers, a fox or horse tail, a beard, and a flaccid penis, interpreted as dancing on all-fours. Another smaller sorcerer with a bison head, human legs and feet, and upright posture stands above several animal depictions, and is interpreted as holding and playing a musical bow to herd all the animals. The third sorcerer has a seemingly bison upper body and human lower body with testicles and an erection. Some drawn human figures feature lines radiating out. These are generally interpreted as wounded people, with the lines representing pain or spears, possibly related to some initiation process for shamans. One such \\"wounded man\\" at Grotte de Cougnac, France, is drawn on the chest of a red Irish elk. A wounded sorcerer with a bison head is found at the 17,000 year old Grotte de Gabillou. Some caves featured \\"vanquished men\\", lying presumably dead at the foot of generally a bull or bear. For tangible art, the early Aurignacian Hohlenstein-Stadel, Swabian Jura, has yielded the famous lion-human sculpture. It is tall, which is much larger than the other Swabian Jura figurines. A possible second lion-human was also found in the nearby Hohle Fels. An ivory slab from Geissenkl√∂sterle has a carved relief of a human figure with its arms raised in the air wearing a hide, the \\"worshipper\\". A 28,000 year old \\"puppet\\" was identified at Brno, Czech Republic, consisting of an isolated head piece, torso piece, and left arm piece. It is presumed that the head and torso were connected by a rod, and the torso and arm by some string allowing the arm to move. Because it was found in a grave, this is speculated to have belonged to a shaman for use in rituals involving the dead. A 14,000 year old large stone from Cueva del Juyo, Spain, seems to have been carved to be the conjoined face of a man on the right and a big cat on the left (when facing it). The man half seems to feature a mustache and a beard. The cat half (either a leopard or a lion) has slanting eyes, a snout, a fang, and spots on the muzzle suggestive of whiskers. Spanish archaeologists Leslie G. Freeman and Joaqu√≠n Gonz√°lez Echegaray argued that Cueva del Juyo was specifically modified to serve as a sanctuary site to carry out rituals. They said the inhabitants dug out a triangular trench and filled it with offerings including Patella (limpets), the common periwinkle (a sea snail), pigments, the legs and jaws (possibly with meat still on them) of red and roe deer, and a red deer antler positioned upright. The trench and offerings were then filled in with dirt, and a seemingly flower-like arrangement of bright cylindrical pieces of red, yellow, and green pigments was placed on top. This was then buried with clay, stone slabs, and bone spearpoints. The clay shell was covered by a slab of limestone supported by large flat stones. Somewhat similar structures associated with some representation of a human have also been found elsewhere in Magdalenian Spain, such as at Cueva Erralla, Entrefoces rock shelter, Cueva de Praileaitz, Cueva de la Garma, and Cueva de Erberua. =Mortuary practices= EEMH buried their dead, commonly with a variety symbolic grave goods as well as red ochre, and multiple people were often buried in the same grave. However, the archaeological record has yielded few graves, less than 5 preserved per millennium, which could indicate burials were seldom given. Consequently, it is unclear if they represent isolated burials or form a much more generalised mortuary tradition. Across Europe, some graves contained multiple individuals, in this case most often featuring both sexes. Most burials are dated to the Gravettian (most notably 31‚Äì29 thousand years ago) and towards the end of the Magdalenian (from 14‚Äì11 thousand years ago). None are identified during the Aurignacian. Gravettian burials seem to differ from post-LGM ones. The former ranged across Europe from Portugal to Siberia, whereas the latter conspicuously restricted to Italy, Germany, and southwest France. About half of buried Gravettians were infants, whereas infant burials were much less common post-LGM, but it is debated if this was due to social differences or infant mortality rates. Graves are also commonly associated with animal remains and tools, but it is unclear if this was intentional or was coincidentally a part of the filler. They are much less common post-LGM, and post-LGM graves are more commonly associated with ornaments than Gravettian graves. The most lavish of Palaeolithic burial is a grave from the Gravettian of Sungir, Russia, where a boy and a girl were placed crown-to-crown in a long, shallow grave, and adorned with thousands of perforated ivory beads, hundreds of perforated arctic fox canines, ivory pins, disc pendants, ivory animal figurines, and mammoth tusk spears. The beads were a third the size of those found with a man from the same site, which could indicate these small beads were specifically designed for the children. Only two other Upper Palaeolithic graves were found with grave goods other than personal adornment (one from Arene Candide, Italy, and Brno, Czech Republic), and the grave of these two children is unique in bearing any functional implements (the spears) as well as a bone from another individual (a partial femur). The 5 other buried individuals from Sungir did not receive nearly as many grave goods, with one seemingly given no formal treatment whatsoever. However, most Gravettian graves feature few ornaments, and the buried were probably wearing them before death. Due to such rich material culture and the marked difference of treatment between different individuals, it has been suggested that these peoples had a complex society beyond band level, and with social class distinction. In this model, young individuals given elaborate funerals were potentially born into a position of high status. However, about 75% of EEMH skeletons were men, which sharply contrasts with the predominance of depictions of women in art. Because of the great amount of time, labour, and resources all these grave goods would have required, it has been hypothesised that the grave goods were made long in advance of the ceremony. Because of such planning for multiple burials as well as their abundance in the archaeological record, the seemingly purposeful presence of both sexes, and an apparent preference for individuals with some congenital disorder (about a third of identified burials), it is speculated that these cultures practiced human sacrifice either in fear, disdain, or worship of those with abnormal features, like in many present-day and historical societies. Intricate funerals, in addition to evidence of shamanism and ritualism, has also provoked hypotheses of the belief of an afterlife by EEMH. The earliest evidence of skull cups, and thus ritual cannibalism, comes from the Magdalenian of Gough‚Äôs Cave, England. Further concrete evidence of such rituals does not appear until after the Palaeolithic. The Gough's Cave cup seems to have followed a similar method of scalping as those from Neolithic Europe, with incisions being made along the midline of the skull (whereas the Native American method of scalping involved a circular incision around the crown). Earlier examples of non-ritual cannibalism in Europe do not seem to have followed the same method of defleshing. At least 1 skull cup was transported from a different site. In addition, Gough‚Äôs Cave also yielded a human radius with a zig-zag engraving. Compared to other artefacts in the cave or common to the Magdalenian period, the radius was modified quite little, with the engraving probably quickly etched on (indicated by scrape marks not recorded on any other Magdalenian engraving), and the bone broken and discarded soon thereafter. This may indicate the bone's only function was as a tool in some cannibalistic and/or funerary ritual, rather than being prepared to be carried around by the group as an ornament or tool. In popular culture EEMH tribe in H. G. Wells' The Grisly Folk The \\"caveman\\" archetype is quite popular in both literature and visual media and can be portrayed as highly muscular, hairy, or monstrous, and to represent a wild and animalistic character. Cavemen first appeared in visual media in D. W. Griffith's 1912 Man's Genesis, and among the first appearances in fictional literature were Stanley Waterloo's 1897 The Story of Ab and Jack London's 1907 Before Adam. Cavemen have also been popularly portrayed (inaccurately) as confronting dinosaurs, first done in Griffith's 1914 Brute Force (the sequel to Man's Genesis) featuring a Ceratosaurus. EEMH are also portrayed interacting with Neanderthals, such as in H. G. Wells' 1927 The Grisly Folk, William Golding's 1955 The Inheritors, Bj√∂rn Kurt√©n's 1978 Dance of the Tiger, Jean M. Auel's 1980 Clan of the Cave Bear and her Earth's Children series, and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas' 1987 Reindeer Moon and its 1990 sequel The Animal Wife. EEMH are generally portrayed as superior in some way to Neanderthals which allowed them to take Europe.

Model Products Corporation, usually known by its acronym, MPC, was an American manufacturer of plastic scale model kits and pre-assembled promotional models popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Traditionally a Michigan company, since 2011 the MPC name has been part of Round 2 LLC of South Bend, Indiana. MPC's main competition was Aluminum Model Toys (AMT) and Jo-Han Models. History The brand logo as featured on earlier packaging. Beginnings MPC was established in 1963 by George A. Toteff Jr. (1925‚Äì2011) (The Toledo Blade 2011) and Dick Branstner with facilities in Mount Clemens, Michigan. Toteff had been one of the original employees at AMT, eventually rising to vice president in the company. There, in 1958, he had developed the first ‚Äú3-in-1‚Äù model car kits (Koch 2011) based on his innovative ‚Äúside-slide‚Äù injection-molding technique, which allowed the tooling of one-piece model car bodies (Round2 staff 2011). MPC produced its first promotional models in 1965; the first product to appear under its own logo was a highly detailed 1/25-scale 1964 Corvette Sting Ray coupe featuring working front suspension, and including extra speed and customizing parts (Round2 staff 2011; Ostrander 2011). Another of the company's first 'promos' was a 1965 Dodge Coronet 500 in both convertible and two-door hardtop versions. As with other companies before it, most notably AMT and Jo-Han, MPC developed many of its kits from pre-existing promo toolings. Toteff remained on good terms with his former colleagues at AMT, and many of the first MPC products were distributed in AMT packaging (Round2 staff 2011). For example, the 1967 MPC Plymouth Barracuda, originally made as a dealer promotional for Chrysler, was also marketed as a kit in an AMT box. Later, for 1968 and 1969 the newly designed second-iteration Barracuda reverted to an MPC box, with no apparent AMT connection (Doty 2011). Original model kits quickly followed, including the 1932‚Äì33 Chevy Roadster and Panel Truck, the first 'non-classic' subjects other than a Ford to be offered in 1/25-scale kit form (Round2 staff 2011). Ownership of the MPC name About 1970, General Mills bought MPC from Toteff, who stayed on as president.text accompanying model display, Walter P. Chrysler Museum, Auburn Hills, Michigan General Mills also had purchased Lionel and the MPC name and logo even appeared on early 1970s train sets next to the Lionel logo. After these two names was stated, \\"...of the fun group at General Mills\\". An example was the Silver Star train appearing about 1972, with \\"The Mighty Sound of Steam\\". In the late 1970s, General Mills created a separate identity for its toy and hobby arm, CPG Products Corporation. During this time, MPC kits were marketed as part of CPG's Fundimensions Division. General Mills's ownership lasted until 1985 when it sold off its hobby companies. General Mills then floated its remaining toy division as Kenner Parker. 1:20 scale kit of a McLaren Mk-8b Can Am race car. In 1985, MPC was purchased by The Ertl Company, which had also acquired AMT in 1981. Ertl, in turn, became part of RC2 Corporation in 1999, and was subsequently absorbed into TOMY International, Inc. From 2008, MPC products were re-issued under license from TOMY by Round2 LLC, which ultimately acquired MPC's assets outright in 2011 (along with those of AMT and Ertl).Round2 LLC Acquires Iconic Model Kit Brands, press release, Round2 LLC, November 30, 2011 Model lines From its inception, MPC offered original toolings of a wide variety of automobiles ranging from classic luxury cars of the 1920s and 1930s, to contemporary dragsters and funny cars, as well as conceptual customs and caricature models developed by well-known racers and customizers such as Dick Branstner (who had built the original full-size 'Color Me Gone' Dodge Truck dragster), George Barris (designer of the TV Batmobile), and Dean Jeffries (designer of the TV Monkeemobile). Along with the production of pre-assembled promotional models, MPC released a regular series of current-model-year auto kits (annuals).

Examples: 1927 Lincoln Roadster; 1928 Lincoln Phaeton; 'Ma Barker's 1932 Chrysler roadster' (complete with 'bullet holes' in the windscreen); 1932 Imperial Custom 8; and a 1932 Chevy Roadster and Panel Truck. * Connoisseur‚Äôs Classics (1/25): Many of the kits in this series were re-boxings of Gangbuster subjects. Examples: 1932 Chrysler Roadster and LeBaron Imperial; 1927 Lincoln Roadster and 1928 Lincoln Phaeton; and a 1914 Stutz Bearcat (which came with a vacuum-formed display base). * Switchers (1/25): This series was a continuation of the \\"3-in-1\\" concept Toteff had introduced at AMT. Examples: 1925 Ford Model T roadster; 1927 Ford Model T coach or cab; 1932 Ford roadster or coupe, and the Ford Tudor Sedan or Phaeton. * TV and movie tie-ins: MPC marketed numerous kits based on popular television shows and movies, most in 1/25 scale. Examples are Hogan's Heroes Jeep, 'The Sweathogs Dream Machine' featuring John Travolta from Welcome Back Kotter, The Monkees GTO Monkeemobile and 'The Fonz Dreamrod' from Happy Days (a simple reworking of the Monkeemobile); Barnabas's Vampire Van from Dark Shadows, The Fall Guy Chevy pickup, John Milner's yellow Deuce Coupe from American Graffiti, the fiberglass sports car from Hardcastle and McCormick, several variations on Space 1999 vehicles, and the Knight 2000 Firebird from Knight Rider. Other notable tie-ins included the 1914 Stutz Bearcat from the 1971 TV series Bearcats! (later re-purposed as part of the Connoisseur's Classics series), and a number of kits related to The Dukes of Hazard: General Lee (1969 Dodge Charger), Sheriff Roscoe‚Äôs Police Car (1977 Dodge Monaco), Daisy‚Äôs Jeep (CJ-7), Daisy‚Äôs Roadrunner and Cooter‚Äôs Tow Truck. Many of the 'Dukes' kits were re-purposed and re-boxed annuals. A few of them were also modified and marketed as slot cars. * Airfix re-boxings: Early in its history, MPC developed a licensing agreement with Airfix, releasing some of the British manucturer's 1/32 scale car kits under the MPC logo with unique box art and lithography. Some examples were: Aston Martin DB-5; Jaguar XK-E; Mercedes Benz 280SL; MGB 1600; Porsche Carrera 906 and 917; Ford GT-40: Ferrari 250; Triumph TR-4A; ‚Äô30 Bentley 4 ¬Ω Litre; and a 1930 Alfa-Romeo 8C LeMans Grand Prix racer. * 1/20 scale cars: From the late 1960s on, MPC tooled a number of kits in larger 1/20 scale.Round 2 staff, loc cit. Notable among these were the McLaren M8B and M8D CanAm Challenge racers, a popular series of Corvette annuals, the AMC AMX and the Dick Dean-designed Shalako dune buggy. These kits often included highly detailed interiors with realistically simulated vinyl interior upholstery. * Slot cars: Like many model makers during the mid-1960s, MPC capitalized on the popularity of slot car racing. Using its plastic car bodies, a new 'Dyn-O-Charger' (or simply 'Dyn-O') slot cars series were at first issued in a yellow box. A notable example of the series was the 1957 Corvette, which featured 'Dyn-O-Brakes', special brakes for the front wheels of the slot car. * Zingers in approximately 1/32 scale: In the early 1970s, MPC ventured into caricature model concepts, similar to Revell's Ed Roth Ratfink custom car kits, or Bill Campbell's Weird-Ohs series for Hawk. Such impish creations were popular at the time and reflected the strong-willed independence of the western and national sub-cultures, which were tied to, first, the beatniks and later, to the hippie scene. MPC's offerings were marketed as 'Zingers', and featured comical stubby and swollen looking vehicles with huge drag racing engines. Examples include Dick Branstner's 'Little Red Truck' (based quite broadly on his 'Color Me Gone' Dodge Truck); the Super Drag Zinger, Super Semi, and Super Dune Zinger; a 1965 Dodge van, a VW microbus, a VW bug, and a Corvette. MPC's caricature models differed from other manufacturer's offerings (such as Aurora) in that they did not feature strange people or animals, but, rather, only oddly distorted vehicles. Thus MPC's answer to the imp phase of hot-rodding was to make the vehicles themselves into caricatures. The Zinger line was reintroduced in 2009 by Round 2 LLC, a recognition of MPC's stature among historic kit-makers. * Chromies: A series of beginner's-level chrome-finished snap-together kits in 1/32 scale introduced in the mid-1970s. Examples include a 1984 Corvette, and the 'Futuristic Dragster' as well as cars from the Wacky Races animated television series. * Additional (non-series) car kits in 1/25 scale: Some of MPC's most memorable kits were released as \\"one-offs\\" and were not part of a dedicated series. Some examples were: Toyota 2000 GT (with female Japanese driver figure), Ford LeMans J Car (with clear plastic body); Super Judge GTO Funny Car Promotional models Promotional model of the 1977 Dodge Monaco in the normal 1:25 scale. Note the paint is metalflake (the color of the underbody is not. Early products MPC began when George Toteff, a vice president at AMT, left to form his own company. AMT had regularly produced pre-assembled promotional models for the Ford Motor Company while Jo-Han had long-standing relationships with Chrysler and American Motors. Toteff's new company developed license agreements with General Motors Corporation as well as Chrysler. Many of MPC's first promotional offerings from about 1965, represented Chrysler vehicles. One of the company's earliest promos was the 1965 Dodge Coronet. One difference between the Coronet promo and contemporary AMT products was that MPC exhaust systems and rear suspension parts were often highlighted in silver, while AMT's were simply portrayed as detailed one-piece chassis molded the same color as the rest of the car. Later MPC dropped this specific type of exhaust highlighting (Doty 2010). MPC thus was a late-comer to the promotional and model-kit scene, preceded by PMC, AMT and Jo-Han. It is interesting to compare origins ‚Äì while AMT had its beginnings in manufacturing dealer oriented promotional models first and kits later, by the 1960s, the tables had turned and kits were the big money makers. From this time forward, MPC mainly profited from kits first and promotional models secondarily. Kit makers Aurora, Industro-Motive Corporation (IMC), Pyro, Revell and Monogram had also appeared earlier than MPC, but did not enter the promotional business of pre-assembled models. By the early 1970s, however, MPC was as popular as any of the 'traditional' model makers. Relations with the Big 3 How a model company chose to offer specific brands depended on its relations with the Detroit Big 3 and the specific contracts it could achieve with them. In the 1970s, a variety of GM products were offered by MPC ‚Äì mostly Chevrolets and Pontiacs, though contracts for some models, like the full-sized Impala changed back and forth between AMT and MPC (Doty 2000a, pp. 87‚Äì88). MPC achieved the dubious distinction of landing contracts for the Vega throughout its entire span and also offered the later Monza. Since the Vega was not seen as being too exotic a vehicle, Doty notes that there would probably have been no MPC Vega kits without the contract for the promos (Doty 2000b, pp. 88‚Äì89). Full-sized Pontiacs ‚Äì LeMans and GTO models ‚Äì were offered early on while MPC Firebirds, always a fairly popular seller, appeared throughout the entire decade. Chrysler products in the early 1970s were Chargers and Barracudas. Of particular cultural interest were the Plymouth Duster promos offered in 1971 and 1972. The cars came in boxes brightly colored in the \\"Rapid Transit System\\" graphics of that time when cars were actively marketed to youth (see Doty 1999, p. 88). In the late 1970s, MPC also offered Chrysler promos of the Volare and the larger Monaco. These were not so popular, but were still accurately crafted with actual metallic model paints and detailed chassis. 1976 Monza with box. Note the simple letter stamping on the box end flap. The remainder of the package is plain white, which is a great contrast to earlier more colorful boxes. In the late 1970s, MPC issued a plethora of GM promos, particularly Chevrolet Corvettes and Camaros. A 1978 and 1979 Monte Carlo and Monza were offered. In 1981, the downsized Chevy El Camino was a promotional and Corvettes continued to be offered in the early 1980s ‚Äì appearing in their simple undecorated white boxes with end flaps labeled ‚Äì until AMT/Ertl took over such contracts. These MPC Corvettes were manufactured in large numbers and can be easily found in antique malls and flea markets ‚Äì often for prices between five and fifteen dollars. Additional model products * Aircraft Kits While MPC offered no original aircraft kits of its own, the company maintained a longstanding relationship with the British model maker Airfix. Before 1970, both companies had actively re-boxed each other's car kits under license (Gibson 1970). Additionally, Airfix' line of aircraft kits in 1/72, 1/48 and 1/24 scale were imported from the U.K. and sold under the MPC logo. Some of the initial 1/72 reissues from about 1970‚Äì71 featured an array of extra \\"customizing features\\" with a few chrome-plated parts, and strange \\"psychedelic\\" decals, similar to the wild custom car kits of the time (Mesner n.d.). Later, MPC would offer several of these same Airfix 1/72 kits as part of its \\"Profiles\\" series. Each kit in this series featured a decal sheet with three complete sets of markings. The decals and box art were based on color illustrations from the \\"Profile Publications\\" monograph series (Mesner n.d.). In 1981, the Airfix kit range was acquired from the administrators by General Mills. Production was relocated to France and the model range was co-ordinated with MPC. Eventually in 2006 the Airfix name was bought by Hornby (David 2007). In the CPG Fundimensions era, MPC carried out a marketing scheme that it called \\"Golden Opportunity kits.\\" One could collect \\"Golden Wings\\" tokens from the airplane kit boxes and turn them in for free models. * Canadian boxings MPC boxed some kits specifically for the Canadian market like the \\"RCMP\\" 1973 Chevrolet Mounty police car, the 1/20 scale McLaren, and the \\"Voodoo\\" Corvette. The Canadian-market offerings were among the first model kits to include both English and French documentation on the boxes and instruction sheets. * Other models The company made scale model kits of Schwinn \\"Sting-Ray\\" and other bicycles and action figure kits, like the Pirates of the Caribbean offerings (based on the original ride at Disneyland, and not directly related to the recent movie series) and a Dungeons and Dragons scene. Additional TV tie-ins included items related to Marvel Comics The Incredible Hulk, The Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman (\\"Bionic Repair Shop\\"), as well as Dark Shadows. Movie figures from Disney's Haunted Mansion series', Stephen Sommers' The Mummy trilogy, Alien, The Time Machine, Raiders of the Lost Ark and a series of Star Wars ships also appeared. A unique Aurora-like set of horror figures were the cartoonish \\"Glo-Heads\\" of Dracula, Ape Man, the Mummy, and the Werewolf. MPC also offered a series of kits based on \\"Hot Curl\\", a surfer caricature. The kits included Hot Curl, his girlfriend Curl's Gurl, and his brother Hot Shot, a skateboarder; for a time a small figure of Hot Curl was included in MPC's 1929 Ford pickup/woodie kit. MPC also issued two kits based on Tom Medley's \\"Stroker McGurk\\" cartoon character: a hot-rodded surfboard and a Tall T, with a phone booth body mounted on a Model T chassis.

It is located on the Little Outfit Ranch in San Rafael Valley, about ten miles east-southeast of Patagonia, in Santa Cruz County, which borders Mexico on the south and is about 80 miles from Arizona's eastern border with New Mexico. In the early and mid-twentieth century ranch schools became an important part of the educational system in many western states and Arizona led the nation in total number. The concept set high academic standards but also put strong emphasis on the ideals of the American Old West, rugged outdoor activities, and independence of spirit. The Little Outfit Ranch School provides an excellent example this approach to education and in 2009 the schoolhouse itself was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.W. D. Leggett, Little Outfit Schoolhouse, National Register of Historic Places Nomination, Arizona State Historic Preservation Office, January 8, 2009. The schoolhouse is managed by the Little Outfit Preservation Group, Inc. History The land the schoolhouse is on was homesteaded by Harry Fryer in 1917 and in 1940 it was bought by Buel and Katharine Hutchinson who named it The Little Outfit Ranch. They built a one-room schoolhouse and later that same year opened The Little Outfit Ranch School. The school was coed the first two years but later was all boys, usually had 20 to 25 students and covered grades 3 to 8. Academics were strong but there was a great emphasis on the ways of the West and every student was assigned a horse. The Surrounding Territory The San Rafael Valley is still very sparsely populated, the rich grasslands being used primarily as range for cattle. The nearest house even now seventy years later is still over a mile away, and in the 1940s the nearest telephone was a ten miles ride. The elevation is 5,100 feet with the mountain called Old Hutch, on the north side of the ranch, rising to nearly 6,000 feet. The entrance road to the ranch is off FR 799, Canelo Pass Road‚Äîa long, dusty, red dirt road that leads to the small town of Patagonia. The Founders The people who founded the Little Outfit Ranch School, Katharine (\\"Kit\\") and Buel Hutchinson, moved from Chicago with their three children; Ann, Mary and Ned in 1940. Adventure was surely part of their motive for moving to such a remote area, but the move would also solve a health problem Ned had ‚Äì a persistent cough that had only disappeared when he stayed several weeks on the 76 Ranch near Willcox, Arizona. Kit Hutchinson was the boss of the ranch, the school's head mistress, and a surrogate mother to the boys. She could ride with the best of them and often organized cross country treasure hunts on horseback. She taught English to the older boys and she was quick to seize opportunities for exciting learning like Tucson rodeos, Christmastime trips deep into Mexico, and witnessing the mustering out of the last of the Army's Indian Scouts at Fort Huachuca. She was amazingly clever at writing plays for the boys to perform on the stage behind the schoolhouse, much to the delight of the neighboring ranchers. She was also quick in making up songs about life at the Little Outfit, wonderful at organizing elaborate graduation ceremonies, and all the while keeping parents well informed on how their boys were doing. Buel Hutchinson moved permanently to the ranch in 1942. He had been the sales manager for the Warfield Spice Company that Kit's father owned. On the ranch he maintained the various appliances and machines, the electric generation plant, the milk house supplies and so on. He was a natural with the boys and an excellent teacher ‚Äì both academically and athletically (Buel held the record for the longest touchdown run in football for the University of Chicago). How Students Were Recruited Publicity that would attract students depended mostly on word of mouth but brochures promoting the school were also used. An article in Arizona Highways described a number of ranch schools in operation by 1940, their appeal, and their significant benefit to Arizona.Arizona Highways, Arizona Ranch Schools, Volume 15, Number 9, September 1939 The Tucson Chamber of Commerce put out a brochure touting the thirteen ranch schools surrounding Tucson including the Little Outfit School. The Chicago area produced many students thanks to the Hutchinson's having lived there before purchasing the Little Outfit Ranch. The Chicago Tribune published a full-page article on the ‚ÄúSchoolboy Cowboys‚Äù with many pictures featuring the local Chicago boys attending the Little Outfit School.The Sunday Chicago Tribune, Page 6, Schoolboy Cowboys, April 30, 1944. The Ranch School Concept The concept of ranch schooling had an especially high appeal for the parents of students suffering from various health conditions, primarily asthma. A better climate, many believed, might assist in the recuperation of sickly youths. The parents hoped that the clean, warm air combined with the physical activities that the ranch school offered in addition to the academic work, would aid their children's physical rejuvenation. Instructions in the ideals of the cowboys ‚Äì independence, honesty, and a willingness to work hard added to the ranch school's allure. Arizona soon led the nation in the number of ranch schools. School Closure The closure of the Little Outfit School ‚Äì As a small, private institution, the Little Outfit School was completely dependent on a high level of effort by its owners, the Hutchinson's. Doubtless an important consideration in their continuing was the completion of their own children's education which was accomplished in the late 1940s. The resignation of Slim Mayo ‚Äì the school's wrangler‚Äîin 1947 left the school without one of its most important teachers. While formal grade school education stopped in 1950, the schoolhouse continued as an educational institution for many years thereafter, functioning as the center of an active summer camp. Because it is a fine example of the ranch school education which was so important in Arizona in the early years of the twentieth century, The Little Outfit Schoolhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 8, 2009. The schoolhouse is managed by the Little Outfit Preservation Group, Inc.

Other oil fields are shown in dark gray. The Lompoc Oil Field is a large oil field in the Purisima Hills north of Lompoc, California, in Santa Barbara County. Discovered in 1903, two years after the discovery of the Orcutt Oil Field in the Solomon Hills, it is one of the oldest oil fields in northern Santa Barbara County, and one of the closest to exhaustion, reporting only of recoverable oil remaining out of its original as of the end of 2008. p. 94 Its sole operator as of 2016 was Freeport McMoRan Oil and Gas, who acquired it with their 2013 purchase of Plains Exploration & Production. In 2009, the proposed decommissioning and habitat restoration of the field was part of a controversial and so-far unsuccessful deal between Plains, several environmental groups, Santa Barbara County, and the State of California, to allow Plains to carry out new offshore oil drilling on the Tranquillon Ridge, in the Pacific Ocean about southwest of the Lompoc field. Setting Detail of the Lompoc field, showing Vandenberg Village to the south and the Los Alamos Valley to the north. The Lompoc field follows the line of the Purisima Hills, a northwest-to-southeast trending range dividing the Santa Ynez Valley on the south from the Los Alamos Valley to the north, and the field is about long by across. The hills are a part of the Burton Mesa region, much of which is an ecological reserve maintained by the California Department of Fish and Game. Populated places close to the field include Vandenberg Village and Lompoc to the south, Vandenberg Air Force Base to the west, and Los Alamos to the east. One public road, Harris Grade Road, traverses the field from north to south. Several access points to the field are along this road. Most of the field's productive area, and most of the oil wells, are on the southern slope of the hills. Elevations on the oil field range from around on the west to at the summit of the Purisima Hills. Climate in the region is Mediterranean, with cool, rainy winters and dry summers during which the heat is greatly diminished by fog and northwesterly winds from the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, which is about west of the field. Prevailing winds year-round are from the west-northwest. The north slopes of the hills contain stands of bishop pine as well as coast live oak forest; the south-facing slopes have mostly chaparral vegetation types, including coastal sage scrub. Fourteen inches (36 cm) of rain falls in a typical winter. Drainage on the south side of the hills is to the Santa Ynez River, and then out to the sea via Lompoc; to the north, runoff goes to San Antonio Creek, which exits to the ocean through Vandenberg Air Force Base. A small discontiguous part of the field, the Northwest Area, is situated about a mile and a half northwest of the main part of the field, close to the main gate of Vandenberg Air Force Base. As of 2009, that area had 9 actively producing wells, as well as three used for water disposal.Lompoc Field query at California Department of Conservation Geology Lompoc Oil Field Structure Map View from Harris Grade Road within the Lompoc Oil Field, south towards Vandenberg Village. The two storage tanks in the middle distance are on the field. The hills are the surface expression of an anticlinal structure consisting of the adjacent Lompoc Anticline and the Purisima Anticline, which are offset from each other by faults. The surface Paso Robles and Careaga formations are Pleistocene sediments. Underneath them is the relatively impermeable Sisquoc Formation, of Pliocene and Miocene age. Beneath this unit, and separated by an unconformity, is the oil-bearing rock, the fractured shale of the Miocene-age Monterey Formation, at the top of which oil has pooled, halted in its upward migration by the impermeable cap of the Sisquoc. The minimum depth at which oil has been recovered in the Lompoc field is approximately , and the average net thickness of the oil-bearing rock is 450 to .

In 1901 the Orcutt field was discovered, and in 1903 the discovery well for the Lompoc field was drilled, after several failed attempts to find oil in the obviously promising anticlinal structure. A 1902 well was wrecked in an earthquake before it found oil. The discovery well, by the Union Oil Company of California, hit oil in March 1903, and initially produced .DOGGR, p. 240 By 1911, the field had 33 producing wells on the field, six in the process of being drilled, and 15 had already been abandoned, either as dry holes or insufficient producers.Prutzmann, p. 345 Peak production on the field did not occur until 1951, during which the operators reported almost of oil. An enhanced recovery project ‚Äì gas injection to increase reservoir pressure ‚Äì which had commenced in 1929 was discontinued in 1960, and production from the field continued to decline. However the field was not played out. In 1983, Unocal discovered the Northwest Area, a small but productive region about a mile and a half northwest of the main part of the field, following the anticlinal trend of the hills, on the Jesus Maria lease. They reached peak production of of oil from this area in 1989. However, interest in oil drilling in California had been moving offshore, particularly for the major oil companies, who had the resources to build offshore platforms and invest large sums of money in long-term prospects which had considerably greater reserves than the mature and declining onshore fields. Unocal, the operator of the Lompoc field as well as several others in the Santa Maria area, chose the Lompoc field as a central location to build an oil and gas processing plant, while maintaining operations as the production declined. In 1986 the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors approved a request by Unocal, after an extensive environmental review, to develop an offshore oil platform in Federal waters (Platform Irene), a series of pipelines connecting it to a proposed new oil processing facility on the grounds of the Lompoc Oil Field. The plant was built shortly after, and went online in 1987. Unocal divested most of its California assets in February 1996, selling them to Nuevo Energy.Unocal to Sell California Outlets to Texas Firm: February 21, 1996 Plains acquired the field in 2002 with its purchase of Nuevo Energy, and continues to operate it as of the beginning of 2010. The Lompoc field was one of the properties transferred, along with the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant, which then became, and remains, the principal processing plant for Plains's operations in the region. A total of 34 oil wells continued to pump from the field at the beginning of 2009, including 8 in the Northwest Area. Several others were used for water injection ‚Äì primarily of produced water from offshore Platform Irene, as the most convenient disposal for this otherwise unusable water is to reinject it into the geologic formations which once contained petroleum.

Under the terms of the Tranquillon Ridge deal, this and the adjacent area would be converted to protected open space, effectively increasing the area of the Burton Mesa Ecological Reserve, the wooded area in the background, by 3,700 acres. As part of a deal with various environmental groups, including the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center and Get Oil Out!, both venerable opponents of the oil industry in California, Plains offered to decommission the entire Lompoc Field in 2022, donating it as a permanent public nature preserve, in return for being able to slant drill from its existing Platform Irene in Federal waters into the previously untapped Tranquillon Ridge field, in state waters close to shore. Under the terms of the deal, oil produced at Platform Irene from the new field would be pumped to shore through existing pipelines and treated at the Lompoc Oil and Gas Processing plant. Platform Irene, the Lompoc Field, and the Processing Plant would be shut down by 2022, and in the meantime the state would have received approximately $2 billion in tax revenues, while Santa Barbara County would have gotten $350 million. The deal was defeated by a 2-1 vote of the State Lands Commission on January 29, 2009, who cited the unenforceability of the sunset clause.Oil firm, foes strike major deal: Los Angeles Times References Category:Geography of Santa Barbara County, California Category:Lompoc, California Category:Oil fields in Santa Barbara County, California ","title":"Lompoc Oil Field"},{"id":"25828904","text":"Marienlyst Castle, Danish Marienlyst Slot, is a palacial residence located in Helsing√∏r, Denmark. It was named after King Frederik V of Denmark's second wife, Juliana Maria the queen consort of Denmark and Norway. The building formerly served as a royal pavilion of Kronborg Castle and was mostly used as a venue for pleasure and hunting. It was also used by the director-general of the √òresund Custom House, Colonel Adam Gottlob von Krogh and his wife Magdalene, between 1796 and 1847. Hans van Steenwinckel, the royal architect, designed and built the original pavilion and parterre garden in 1587, for King Frederick II of Denmark. The royal estate was then purchased in 1758 by Count Adam Gottlob Moltke, who completely changed the original pavilion and garden with the help of French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin between 1759 and 1763. The additions led to its present-day architectural structure and fa√ßade. Jardin also redesigned the original parterre gardens, changing them to a larger, more modern garden √† la fran√ßaise design, with symmetrical hedges, avenues, fountains and mirror ponds. Within the castle wall boundaries, these elegant garden grounds remain to a large extent intact, but outside, much of the garden has been lost, including the most renowned romantic landscape garden in Denmark, designed by Johan Ludvig Mansa in the 1790s. This was mostly due to the sale of much of the original property by the Helsing√∏r municipality which had purchased the entire Marienlyst estate at auction in 1851. One of the lot purchasers was J.S. Nathanson, who in 1859 built Hotel Marienlyst, the first luxury hotel in Helsing√∏r, named after the castle. Between 1919 and 1921, local Helsing√∏r gardener Gudmund Nyeland Brandt, removed the last remnants of the romantic gardens, replacing them with an 18th-century garden design to match the castle's classical architecture. For the most part it is these gardens visitors will see today. They have been part of Helsing√∏r Municipality Museums since 1930. History=Saint Anne Convent In medieval times there was a chapel dedicated to Saint Anne in the area, which probably belonged to the St. Anna Guild in Helsing√∏r. In 1438 the chapel was given to a community of Franciscan friars which had been founded in 1419, who then converted the chapel into a monastery dedicated to Saint Anne. Nothing remains of the monastery except the street name, Sankt Anna Gade in Helsing√∏r. The monastery was confiscated by the crown during the Reformation of 1536. The former monastery was probably part of the royal property on the grounds, called Lundegaard, where an old stone house is known to have existed in 1576. Frederick II's pavilion and garden During the 1420s, King Eric of Pomerania created Kronborg Castle, the castle immortalized in Shakespeare's play, Hamlet. It was built like a strong fortress for guarding √òresund and ensuring payment of sound dues which were enforced by the immediate firing of all cannons on any ship that refused to pay. It was very effective and collected two thirds of crown revenues. By the late Renaissance, tastes had changed and Kronborg's high walls and bastions made it impossible to have a grand renaissance garden. An old monastery north of the yard was therefore chosen as the new location and named Lundhave after the royal estate. In 1587, Hans van Steenwinckel the royal architect built a parterre garden and a pavilion for King Frederick II of Denmark. It was a three-story building, in the northern Italian renaissance style. The first floor had an armory, that also stored equipment for equestrian competitions, one of the so-called noble disciplines, which also included fencing and dance. This was taught to all nobles at the time through the knight academies. The second floor was where the queen consort, Sophie of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow, had her rooms and the top floor was for the king. Sadly, he would only have a short time to enjoy his newly built pavilion and garden, as he died in 1588, barely a year after construction was completed. His son, King Christian IV of Denmark, would however get to use it throughout his reign, coming there often and spending large sums of money improving the garden and planting rare trees. He would also keep many pheasants and other game birds on the estate, for hunting.  Lundhave from the 1650s to 1750s  King Frederik III of Denmark took over the royal estate in 1648 after the death of his father and seems not to have been very interested in the pavilion but did have the new gardener simplify and restructure the grounds by planting a fruit and vegetable garden. Ten years later, the 1658 war with Sweden took its toll on the pavilion, but fortunately the garden did not suffer too much damage. It remained mostly unused until the end of Frederik III's reign in 1670. A depiction of the pavilion and gardens can be seen in Peder Resen's Atlas Danicus dated 1660 and published in 1677. In the drawings he calls the pavilion and garden, Kongenshafve (The King's Garden). Steenwinckel 's pavilion painted by H. H. Eegberg in 1750 It was King Christian V of Denmark who once again brought life back to the pavilion, often coming to hunt and relax in the gardens. He was also the first to give it a complete renovation. This was done between 1680 and 1681 by Hans van Steenwinckel Jr. to repair the damage that had been caused by general aging over the last century and the recent war with Sweden. Steenwinckel Jr. kept to his father's original drawings, making only a few minor cosmetic changes, like the addition of Christian V's monogram and the year 1681. From 1699 till 1723, the pavilion was owned by Frederick IV of Denmark who renovated it between 1716 and 1717. The king would not return after his marriage to Anne Sophie Reventlow on April 4, 1721. Frederick V of Denmark decided in 1747 to lease Lundhave for four years to Lieutenant Burghof and then, in 1751, sold the property to Johannes G. Putscher, a citizen of Helsing√∏r.  Frederik V's pleasure palace  Garden plan from 1759-60 Lord Chamberlain, Count Adam Gottlob Moltke purchased Lundhave in 1758. It is believed he acted on Frederik V's behalf as the deed was issued to the king in 1760 and kept secret until his death in 1766. During these years, Count Moltke completely changed Frederik II's pavilion with the help of French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin, whose additions led to its present-day architectural structure and fa√ßade. Jardin's initial instructions were to preserve the original pavilion, but he decided to build extensions on either side of the original building, thus creating a palace. They would be of the same height and depth but pulled back a little so as to allow the original pavilion to stand out in relation to the additions. The original lines were preserved and the entire building was brought together visually by a strong rotating main cornice, crowned by a balustrade around the flat roof. The building's exterior also had horizontal bands of polished stone, medallions, festive additions over the windows and arcades on the second floor, emphasizing the classical architecture that Jardin had introduced to Denmark. The interior decoration had a number of prestigious Louis XVI interiors created by artists such as painter Carl Gustaf Pilo, decorators Joseph Christian Lillie, Johan Edvard Mandelberg and sculptor Simon Carl Stanley. The parterre gardens were changed to a larger garden √† la fran√ßaise design, with symmetrical hedging, avenues, boxwood hedges, fountains and mirror ponds. Marienlyst with Jardin's garden complex King Frederik V only had a few years to enjoy their work as he died in 1766 after which Queen Juliana Maria took possession of the castle. It was renamed Marienlyst (Mary's Delight) in her honor and in the 1790s she had a romantic garden laid out with winding paths, follies, including tumuli, hermit cottages and a medieval style Gothic tower. She would use the castle often until her death in 1796. View from the roof terrace towards Helsing√∏r, Kronborg and the √òresund, 1804 During the transition period after her death, there was talk of Crown Prince Frederik taking up residence there but it was not to be. Instead, between 1796 and 1847, it became the residence of the director-general of √òresund Custom House, Colonel Adam Gottlob von Krogh and his wife Magdalene. He built a small thatched half-timbered house, and Krogh's garden in a little grove on the property in 1800. The building is no longer visible but parts of the small stone fence around the garden can still be seen. Close to the garden is Magdalene‚Äôs Hill where von Krogh set up a monument in the 1830s honoring his wife. He died in 1839, but his widow remained in residence until her death in 1847. Ole J√∏rgen Rawert: Marienlyst, 27 May 1820 In his 1824 book Denmark Delineated, Andreas Andersen Feldborg referred to the romantic gardens: \\"Hamlet's garden is the favorite promenade of the inhabitants of Elsinore (Helsing√∏r). It is generally filled with groups of elegant females and lovely children, whose manners and appearance bear pleasing testimony to the state of society in this part of his Danish Majesty's dominions.\\" Just two years later, a young Hans Christian Andersen also writes about Marienlyst, during a class outing whilst at grammar school in Helsing√∏r. It is worth noting that his youthful excitement shows that he had yet to travel abroad very much: \\"Yesterday I was with Meisling in Marienlyst; oh, it's one of the finest I've seen! Where sea and the whole countryside is lovely. Meisling says that the whole coast here is similar to that of Naples; the glorious hills are there in the garden, everything seems like Switzerland, and I felt so unspeakably happy, oh, one must become a poet or artist to see the beautiful nature. O Benefactor, Thanks! Thank you! for every happy moment! Life is Wonderful!\\" Sold to Helsing√∏r municipality The entire property was offered for sale at public auction by King Frederick VII of Denmark in 1851. The Helsing√∏r municipality purchased it for 32,000 Rigsbankdaler, parceling out most of the land, then renting out the castle to J.S. Nathanson with his nearby Marienlyst Health Spa and Bathing House (Marienlyst Kur og S√∏bad). He renovated the castle, making it part of his resort. The connection to the health spa closed in 1896 and, in 1904, the castle was rented out as accommodation for three families. Park The park was converted to its present appearance between 1919 and 1921 under the leadership of local gardener Gudmund Nyeland Brandt. It would not be a reconstruction of the Jardin gardens but instead a reinterpretation of 17th century neoclassical style, appropriate to castle's classical design. Today In 1930, the Town Museum moved into the basement and, in 1940, the whole building was taken over by the museum. After thorough restoration in 1953 by architect Volmars Drosted, Marienlyst was used as offices for Helsing√∏r City Council. Marienlyst Castle is operated today as a branch of the Helsing√∏r Municipality Museums. The castle has a permanent exhibition of paintings and Helsing√∏r silver from the 18th and 19th centuries. They have over the years also organized temporary exhibitions, mainly dealing with the history of art. The painting exhibitions include William Petersen's a forgotten golden age of painting and marine painter Carl Frederik S√∏rensen. Within the Danish handicraft exhibitions have been shown The Danish Brooch, The Ceramic Jug and Beast of Law.

It is within the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Kincardine and Deeside. Location The church building is situated in Dunnottar woods, Stonehaven (within the AB39 postcode area), sitting high above the bank on the Carron water. It sits on the south- western periphery of Stonehaven, and is approximately a 20-minute walk from the Market Square in the centre of town. Dunnottar Castle stands approximately one and a half miles to the south-east of the church. The manse stands directly across the road to the west. Dunnottar Parish also holds property including St Bridget's hall on Dunnottar Avenue, Stonehaven. The hall, which was built in 1887 and stands on the site of a previous church, was built to act as a missionary church to the Old Town, or 'Auld Toon', of Stonehaven. Historically morning services were held in Dunnottar Church, and evening services were held in St Bridget's. St Bridget's hall is now used for the Parish Evening Communion and meeting of the Church's organisations. It is also let out to community organisations.http://www.dunnottarchurch.net/property/stbridgets.html Dunnottar Parish Church official websiteDunnottar Church interior, Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire Buildings The church, in its present location, was re-built in 1852 and later extended in 1869. It again underwent major reconstruction in 1903, which made it considerably larger when a nave and chancel were added, turning the previously rectangular building into a cruciform shape. The building recently underwent more renovations, this time to make it more accessible, and to include a multi-purpose activity room. The churchbell which was cast in 1793 by Andrew Lawson, the last of the Old Aberdeen founders is supposed to be one of the best examples of his work, F. C. Eeles in his ‚ÄúChurch bells of Kincardineshire‚Äù speaks of it as follows: The Marischal Aisle, Dunnottar Church, Aberdeenshire‚ÄúInsignificant though they are, those few fleur-de-lys used on the Dunnottar bell are perhaps one of the very latest survivals of the ecclesiastical art of the Middle Ages. This is perfectly possible because founders' stamps were handed on from one founder to another and in England there are several cases of the use of medieval stamps at the end of the 17th century. Moreover, in the foreign mouldings and outline of the Dunnottar bell, we see a lingering survival of that continental influence which ever since the English wars in the 14th century had held such sway in Scotland.‚Äù The Marischal Aisle (nowadays a Mausoleum), sits in the current church grounds and was first build in 1582 by George Keith, the 5th Earl Marischal of Scotland and founder of Marischal College in Aberdeen.

At one time the company was owned by the now defunct Newmark and Lewis. The chain declared bankruptcy on January 14, 2010 and liquidated all stores by February 28, 2010. History=Beginning In 1947, Bernie's was founded by Bernard \\"Bernie\\" Rosenberg, an enterprising gas station owner. Bernie had many friends in the community and after the war, realized there was an opportunity to help people purchase their first television set. He initially sold televisions and radios from his gas station, but as customer demand increased Bernie found the need to expand. He opened his first showroom, Bernie's TV and Appliance, in Bloomfield, Connecticut in 1953.About Bernie's Bernie, with the help of his son Milton and other family members, continued to grow and expand the business. Bernie Rosenberg died in 1988. Bernie's was, at one point, New England's largest family-owned Audio, Video, TV, Appliance and Bedding retailer. Bernie's son Milton Rosenberg was President upon the company's filing for bankruptcy. Newmark & Lewis era In 1985, the Rosenberg family sold its five Bernie's stores to Newmark & Lewis. Milton Rosenberg continued with Newmark & Lewis until 1990, when he left the company and bought House of TV in Springfield, MA. The Newmark & Lewis company went bankrupt and shut its doors in 1991. Rosenberg bought back the Bernie's name for $1 and opened a single store, capitalizing on the opportunity to rebuild his family's Bernie's chain. Bernie's second life By 1999, Milton had rebuilt Bernie's from 1 store into a 10 store chain, with locations in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Bernie's was employing 457 employees and expected $140 million in sales in 2000. The chain continued to grow, moving its headquarters and warehouse to Enfield, CT in 2004. By the end of 2009, there were 15 Bernie's stores. Bankruptcy Losses began to mount in 2008, when the 15-store chain had $125.4 million in sales and a loss of $234,154. The downturn in the economy was a contributing factor to declining sales and in 2009 sales had dropped 10.5 percent (to $112.2 million). Losses continued to grow, with 2009 losses of $1.9 million. In late 2009, Rosenberg hired Altman and Co., a debt restructuring company from Stoughton, MA. Several options were explored for keeping the retail chain open, which included finding a buyer for the company or closing some of the under performing stores. Unfortunately, neither option proved viable. Bernie's was forced to file for bankruptcy on January 14, 2010. Bernie's nine Connecticut stores, one Rhode Island store and five Massachusetts stores were expected to close by the end of February 2010, after a liquidation sale run by Hilco. Milton Rosenberg had been hailed for his efforts to protect the interests of his customers and 350 employees through the bankruptcy proceedings. Gift cards were honored and customer deposits returned (or redeemed for merchandise). Milton retained 100 percent of employees through the sale, until their locations were closed. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal went on record to state how pleased he was \\"with Bernie's cooperative and caring spirit toward consumers.\\"A Solid Exit Plan for Bernie's Chain During the bankruptcy proceedings, current and former employees were angered to discover the administrators of their 401(k) accounts withdrew funds to cover the termination and wind down of the 401(k) plans. For all active plans, 6% of the total value was withdrawn to cover costs. The matter was investigated by the Connecticut State Attorney General's office. Resolution to the matter is still pending.Bernie's Employees Say Company Taking Money Out Of Their 401(k) In late February 2010, sources within the Bernie's chain reported Milton Rosenberg was interested in purchasing the Bernie's name and re-opening an appliance outlet store in Manchester, CT. Liquidation sales at remaining Bernie's locations were completed on February 28, 2010. The final Bernie's locations closed their doors for good at 8pm ET.Bernie's Locations References Category:Defunct discount stores of the United States Category:Retail companies established in 1947 Category:Companies disestablished in 2010 Category:Companies that have filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010 Category:1947 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"Bernie's"},{"id":"25828995","text":"Cemil is a Turkish given name and is derived from Arabic Jamil with other Arabic variants Gamil (mainly in Egypt), Djemil (mainly in North African countries) and Djamil.

Italian means by definition a native or inhabitant of Italy or a person of Italian descent. Italian people ‚Äì living in the Italic peninsula or abroad ‚Äì have been throughout history the source of important inventions and innovations in the fields of writing, calendar, mechanical and civil engineering, musical notation, celestial observation, perspective, warfare, long distance communication, storage and production of energy, modern medicine, polymerization and information technology. Italians also contributed in theorizing civil law, scientific method (particularly in the fields of physics and astronomy), double-entry bookkeeping, mathematical algebra and analysis, classical and celestial mechanics. Often, things discovered for the first time are also called inventions and in many cases, there is no clear line between the two. The following is a list of inventions, innovations or discoveries known or generally recognized to be Italian. Alphabetical list of Italian Inventions=A *Aircraft with tractor configuration propeller: the world's first airplane having a \\"Tractor\\" configuration, propeller on the front, was the Goupy No.2 (first flight on 11 March 1909) designed by Mario Calderara and financed by Ambroise Goupy at the French firm Bl√©riot A√©ronautique.Mario Calderara, Commander Calderara Glances Backward and Ahead, U.S. Air Services, Volume 15, Air Service Publishing Company, September 1930, page 38 At the time, it was the fastest airplane in existence.

This device made inertial navigation possible. *Cello, with 'The King Violoncello' by Andrea Amati being the earliest known bass instrument of the violin family to survive. *Centrifugal Pump: the first machine that could be characterized as a centrifugal pump was a mud lifting machine that appeared as early as 1475 in a treatise by the Italian Renaissance engineer Francesco di Giorgio Martini. *Codex: is the precursor of modern books, having defined the reference format of virtually all the books of Western civilization. Invented during Roman times, its adoption was later spread by Christianity.Roberts, Colin H; Skeat, TC (1983). The Birth of the Codex. London: British Academy. pp. 15‚Äì22. . *(Modern Diesel) Common Rail designed by researcher Mario Ricco of the FIAT Group. *Proportional compass: generally featuring a proportional scale, it could be used for calculus of infinitesimals and proportions of geometric figures. There are three types: **Reduction compass, developed by Commandino Federico (inventor of the polymetric compass) and Joost B√ºrgi. **Proportional eight spikes compass, invented by Fabrizio Mordente and used by G.

Perfected by Amatino Mannucci in the 14th century. The actual invention could have been Roman or Asiatic. Anyway, the system reached a huge diffusion as a consequence of Italian use and theorisation, with Summa de Arithmetica containing the rules of double-entry, the first example of calculating a neperian logarithm as well as early examples of probability calculus. * Doxorubicin, a chemotherapy agent invented by Farmitalia Spa in the 1950s. *D-Shape, a new 3D printer capable of printing entire buildings invented in 2004 by Enrico Dini.

Chemical Publishing Co. . He pioneered galvanoplastic experiments, introducing the technique of electroplating. His acquaintance with A. Volta played an important role in his scientific career. He hypothesized that in the chemical pile there was also a transport of atoms, obtaining experimental evidence of this. He discovered the properties of coal cathodes as electrical conductors and succeeded in covering them with a metallic layer. He sensed the possible applications in the industrial field, sharing this procedure with a Pavese goldsmith, who used it. *Encyclopedia: from the Greek enk√Ωklios paid√®ia, meaning a set of doctrines constituting a complete education. The comprehensive works of Aristotle can be considered encyclopedic (covering politics, rhetoric, ethic, aesthetic, psychology, biology, math). The first Latin encyclopedia was written by Cato the Elder in an attempt to mitigate the influence of Greek culture. He wrote for his son an \\"encyclopedia\\" of what he believed to be the necessary subjects for the Roman citizen: agriculture, rhetoric, medicine, law and warfare. Marcus T. Varro wrote a second, more complete and systematic encyclopedia, covering nine disciplines: grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, musical theory, medicine, and architecture. Plinius the Elder wrote Historia naturalis, the first encyclopedia to survive as a complete work. Marziano F. Capella wrote an allegoric encyclopedia in prose and verses, De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae. These encyclopedias, along with the works of Cassiodorus and Boethius, paved the way for the medieval seven liberal arts. * Epidemiology (innovated): Roman scholar Marcus Varro mentioned microorganisms as a possible causal agent of diseases. Girolamo Fracastoro, in the mid 16th century, was the first one to scientifically state the real nature of germs, infection, and contagious ways of disease transmission. He attributed the causes of diseases to very small living particles, invisible to the eye. They were considered vulnerable to fire, capable of self multiplying as well as spreading by air.On Contagion, Contagious Diseases and Their Cure (1546) by Girolamo Fracastoro (1478-1553) * Espresso machine **first prototype invented by Angelo Moriondo in 1884 in Turin.\\"Bollettino delle privative industriali del Regno d‚ÄôItalia\\", 2nd Series, Volume 15, Year 1884, pages 635 ‚Äì 655 ** (piston driven model) invented by Achille Gaggia in 1945.Pendergrast, Mark (2001) [1999]. Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World. London: Texere. p. 218. . *Estimo: discipline, part of economic science, which establishes the logical and methodological principles allowing a reasoned, objective and generally valid formulation of the esteem of the monetary value of economic goods. The first estimative surveys of a normative character took shape with the Italian Catasti a Valore (translated, land-value registers), called Estimi a Apprezzi. Florentine estimate method was already codified in the thirteenth century. From the sixteenth century the land, merchant and then civil esteems of the capital began to spread in Italy. The first modern treaty on Estimo was Trattato della stima dei Beni Stabili by Cosimo Trinci, who introduced the concept of ascending and descending influences on the capitalization rate according to the different land's characteristics. Also see Roman Cadastre. *Eudiometer, invented by Alessandro Volta and Marsilio Landriani. Thanks to this instrument Lavoisier discovered the chemical composition of water. * Eyeglasses: originating from Italy, the eyeglasses were perhaps the invention of an unidentified Venetian glassmaker of the 13th century. The research of Roger Bacon on magnifying glasses probably aided their future development. F * Film festival: founded as Esposizione d‚ÄôArte Cinematografica, the Venice Film Festival was established in 1932. * Forlanini helicopter, first engine-powered helicopter. A steam powered helicopter which first flew in 1877, designed by Enrico Forlanini in Milan. This has represented the first heavier-than-air aircraft lifting from the ground with autonomous means. Italian engineering will further develop the helicopter: on 7 April 1925 Corradino d'Ascanio patented the helicopter with two coaxial propellers. Other patents and inventions related to the aeronautical world followed. G *Microscope: Sometimes credited as the first compound microscope, Galileo Galilei found after 1610 that he could close focus his telescope, maybe even turning it around backwards, to view near by small objects.A. Mark Smith, From Sight to Light: The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics, University of Chicago Press - 2014, page 387 This method was combersom since he had to extend his 2 foot long telescope out to 6 feet to view objects that close.Daniel J. Boorstin, The Discoverers, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group - 2011, page 327 After seeing a purpose built compound microscope by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, Galileo built his own improved version.Raymond J.

William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391uoregon.edu, Galileo Galilei (Excerpt from the Encyclopedia Britannica) Giovanni Faber coined the name microscope for the compound microscope Galileo submitted to the Accademia dei Lincei in 1625 (Galileo had called it the \\"occhiolino\\" or \\"little eye\\"). *Galleon (origins): historical evidence suggests that this iconic type of ship was pioneered by the early 16th century Venetians and later spread to Iberian Peninsula, where it became widely adopted and further developed. *Gelato: the Renaissance alchemist Cosimo Ruggieri created the first gelato flavor at the Medici's court, in Florence: the 'fior di latte'. The architect Bernardo Buontalenti invented the 'egg cream' gelato. In 1903 Italo Marchioni patended a machine for producing the gelato cone. * (Modern) giro system: a payment transfer from one bank account to another bank account initiated by the payer, not the payee. The first occurrences of book money can be traced back in Northern Italy and, in particular, in Venice. *Geothermal power plant, the first one being built in Tuscany (1904) by Piero Ginori Conti.

I * Induction motor: Galileo Ferraris invented the AC commutator- free three-phase induction motor. He was the first one to demonstrate this invention in 1885; around the same time, Nikola Tesla independently developed a similar invention.Alternating currents of electricity: their generation, measurement, distribution, and application by Gisbert Kapp, William Stanley, Jr.. Johnston, 1893. Page 140. [cf., This direction has been first indicated by Professor Galileo Ferraris, of Turin, some six years ago.

J *Jacuzzi Spa, founded in 1915 by seven Italian brothers from Northern Italy and led by Giocondo and Candido Jacuzzi. Its first product was a portable hydrotherapy unit that sat in the bath. * Jeans, type of trousers originated from the city of Genoa, Italy (hence probably the name) and possibly N√Æmes, France. Modern Jeans have been invented by Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss in 1873. * Jumping position in horsemanship, developed by Federico Caprilli.

A motorcycle is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle. Firsts known petroleum motorcycles are the Daimler Reitwagen with 2 wheels plus 2 outriggers (1885), and the Butler Petrol Cycle with 3 wheels plus 2 castors (1887). In 1893 Bernardi mounted a petrol engine on a propulsion wheel for an ordinary bicycle, thus, according to what Enrico Fermi wrote for the Treccani Encyclopedia, creating the first motorcycle. Bernardi is to be considered one of the pioneers of the automobile too. He partnered with the Miari e Giusti to produce three- and four-wheeled automobiles powered by the gasoline engine he had invented and patented in 1882. The Bernardi mod 3,5 HP (1896) features many of his innovations, such as geometrically correct steering, cylinder with detachable head, overhead valves and a centrifugal inlet valve regulator. The quality of the vehicles was demonstrated by travelling for 60000 Km without engine failure. * Motorways, as a controlled access highway that directly connects two cities: Autostrada Milano-Varese in 1924. *Moving Picture Experts Group Standard. MPEG Standard has been a collective and international effort in which the Italian engineer Leonardo Chiariglione played a major role: the Movie Picture Experts Group was founded by L. Chiariglione and the Japanese Hiroshi Yasuda. *Multi-mirror telescope, made possible by the pioneering work and research of Guido Horn d‚ÄôArturo. N * Nativity Scene, developed from the sacred Christmas representations in the churches, probably linked to the living crib of San Francesco d'Assisi. Dominicans, Franciscans and Jesuits spread the nativity scene in Italy and Europe. * Newspaper, first newspapers started circulating in Venice in 1563; they were originally named Gazette, news-sheets reporting an abstract of current events and facts. * Nitroglycerin, first synthesized by Ascanio Sobrero in 1847. * Nuclear reactor, the first working fission nuclear reactor was constructed by a team lead by Enrico Fermi, who is regarded as the 'father of nuclear age'. Nuclear fission, converting part of the mass in energy, is far more efficient than other, fossil energy sources. * Nutella, spread made from cocoa, hazelnuts and palm oil; created by the Ferrero firm in 1964 O *Ocarina, musical instrument invented by Giuseppe Donati *Opera House, the first public opera house was the \\"Teatro San Cassiano\\" opened in Venice in 1637 and survived until 1800., Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Opera (music)\\". P * Paddle boat, first designed by Leonardo da Vinci in the 1490s * Pantelegraph, a device for telegraphic transmission of writing and drawing invented by Giovanni Caselli. Commercial service started in 1865. It was the first functional Fax Machine to enter commercial service * Parachute, dates back to the Renaissance Italy *Pasta's industrial production: pasta and related techniques were present since ancient times both in China and Italy. In 1740 the Venetian Paolo Adami opened the first pasta factory. Buitoni mechanical pasta factory, founded in 1827, is the oldest in the world. The French machine Marseillais Purifier speeded up the separation of semolina flour from the bran. In Italy various artificial exsiccation techniques were developed.https://www.dececco.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/06/32054_LENTA-ESSICCAZIONE-PER-UNA-PASTA-DI-QUALITA- SUPERIORE-1.pdf \\"Translation from source in 1889, the Founder of De Cecco was one of the first inventors of pasta drying systems hygienically acceptable and independent from the climatic conditions of the production area.\\" *Pasteurization **Technique: known since the century XII in Asia and used both in China and Japan for alcoholic beverages preservation. **Scientific proof: given by Lazzaro Spallanzani in 1768, disproving the theory of spontaneous generation. * Personal Computer (in a broad sense, not referring to the modern IBM PC compatible architecture), due to the pioneering work of Pier Giorgio Perotto * Perspective: linear perspective was invented by the Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi, whose system depicts how objects shrink in size according to their distance from the eye., NYT, \\"Amazing Leonardo da Vinci Inventions\\". Perspective was later reported in \\"Della pittura\\" (1435) by Leon Battista Alberti. *Piano, an acoustic, stringed musical instrument played using a keyboard, with hammers striking the strings, invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori in 1709. * Pistol: first handheld guns were probably created in the city of Pistoia around 1540.The War Office (UK): Textbook of Small Arms (1929), page 86. H.M. Stationery Office (UK), 1929 Anyway, the etymology of the word is still debated. In 1833 Francesco Antonio Broccu built the first prototype of the (percussion cap) revolver, which was later independently conceived and mass-produced by the American Samuel Colt. * Pizzeria: established in 1738 as a stand for peddlers, Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba was opened in 1830 in Naples. *Polypropylene: **(as a crystalline isotactic polymer): first synthesized by the Italian Giulio Natta and, independently, by the German Karl Rehn, beginning to be manufactured in Italy in 1957. **(as a syndiotactic polymer): first synthesized by Giulio Natta and his coworkers. * Porro prism, invented by Ignazio Porro. *Porta Cipher, first digraphic substitution cipher, invented by Giovanni Battista della Porta.David Kahn, The Codebreakers, 1967, p. 139 * Pretzel, is generally credited to an Italian monk who invented them in 610 A.D. to reward children who learned their prayers. Q * Quick release skewer (for attaching a wheel to a bicycle), invented by Tullio Campagnolo in 1927; he was also among the early innovators of the rod gear derailleur, introducing an anterior dual gears derailleur (in addition to the posterior). R * Radio: developed, successfully tested in 1895 by Guglielmo Marconi and produced on industrial scale as a long-distance communication medium. Marconi partially relied on similar technologies developed by the Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla. Both inventors have always had an independent interest in wireless technology and patents issued and reversed suited the economical needs of the time. *Radiogoniometer: radio-electric apparatus that enables to determinate the direction, and thus the position, of transmission of the radio waves emitted. Applied in radio-assisted navigation, it represented the oldest (as well as one of the most important) instrument. To the development contributed Ettore Bellini, militar engineer Alessandro Tosi, and Alessandro Artom (inventor of the \\"cross-frame\\" r. for long and medium length waves transmitters). * Reggio Emilia approach, an educational method to be applied in preschooling. *RFID (Radio Frequency Identification): the first RFID system was patented in America by the Italian-American Mario Cardullo. The system itself derives from the IFF transponder, which had been introduced by Great Britain during WWII. This RFID technology was used for the telepass, a smart card allowing the driver to pass through a motorway's toll station without halting the vehicle, as well as other contactless mobile payments. S * San Marco 1, a satellite of historical relevance: Italy was the third country, after the Soviet Union and the United States, to successfully launch a satellite, in 1964. *School (partially innovated): at the height of the Roman Republic (and later during the Empire) parents were expected to have their children alphabetized and educated (albeit with partial gender discrimination on the specific subjects), especially in order to enter a political career. Formal schools were established and arranged in progressive and meritocratic tiers. In the words of Quintilian, a teacher in the 1st century AD: \\"Some boys are lazy, unless forced to work; others do not like being controlled; some will respond to fear but others are paralyzed by it. Give me a boy who is encouraged by praise, delighted by success and ready to weep over failure.\\" The rigorous educational method and curriculum used in Rome was copied in its provinces, providing a basis for education systems throughout later Western civilization.Oxford Classical Dictionary, Edited by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, Third Edition. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1996Michael Chiappetta, \\"Historiography and Roman Education,\\" History of Education Journal 4, no. 4 (1953): 149-156. *Science academy: the first scientific society was the Academia Secretorum Naturae founded in Naples in 1560 by the polymath Giambattista della Porta. *Seawalls, ancient Rome pioneered concrete sea walls. * Secchi disk, created by Angelo Secchi used to measure water transparency or turbidity in bodies of water *(Modern) electromagnetic seismograph: in 1855 Luigi Palmieri realizes a seismograph consisting of U-shaped tubes oriented on the different cardinal directions, filling them with mercury. When an earthquake shakes the ground, the motion of the mercury produces an electrical contact that stops a clock and at the same time starts a recording drum registering the motion of a float on the surface of mercury. Results are: time of occurrence, relative intensity and duration. In 1875 Filippo Cecchi introduces the first pendulum seismograph in which the relative motion of the pendulums (with respect to ground motions) is recorded as a function of time. *Roman Senate: a deliberative assembly of the Romans, lasting from the 8th century BC to at least the 7th century AD. The term senate comes from the Latin senatus or \\"Assembly of Elders\\". Previous councils of elders are known in Greece and in the Greek cities of Hellenistic and Roman ages; there was also a similar organism in Carthage. Rome established the senate as one of the fundamental institutions of the state and, for a long time, the main responsible for both domestic and foreign policy. Until the 15th century, the magistracy of the (roman) senator appointed by the Pope, along with magistrates of popular nomination (i.e. tribunes, reformers, conservatories), retained real authority, lasting with a symbolic role until the 19th century. * Shopping Center: the earliest example of public shopping mall was the Trajan's Market in Ancient Rome built around 100-110 AD by Apollodorus of Damascus. *Sphygmomanometer (partially innovated): invented by the Austrian Samuel Siegfried Karl Ritter von Basch, Scipione Riva Rocci added to the design a key element: a cuff encircling the arm. Previous designs had used rubber bulbs filled with water or air to manually compress the artery or other technically complicated ways of pressure measurement. * Staff: invented by music theorist Guido of Arezzo, whose four- line staff is still used today. * Star fort (or Italian outline), with the first examples located in Italy, built towards the mid-15th century. The bastioned trace was originally developed by Italian architects (e.g Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Giuliano Giamberti da Sangallo, Michelangelo Buonarroti),L'Enciclopedia - La biblioteca di Repubblica, Volume 8 (Felid- Ganz), p. 446 with experimentations of shapes continuing during the 16th century (see, for instance, castle of Copertino) * Stiletto, a type of narrow dagger appearing in Italy during the Middle Ages. *Stock Exchange (origins): the underlying principles of stock exchange were introduced by Italian merchants in Bruges (Belgium); an early example of stock exchange dates back to around 1309 in an inn called \\"Huis ter Beurze\\". The inn belonged to the Ter Bourse family, merchants of possible (if not likely) Venetian origin (della Borsa), who conducted transactions at the inn. The term 'beurs' derives from the name of this inn, spreading to other European countries and evolving into 'bourse', 'borsa', 'bolsa', 'b√∂rse', etc. In England the term ‚Äòbourse‚Äô was used between 1550 and 1775, eventually giving way to the term ‚Äòroyal exchange'.De Clercq G. (e.a.), Ter Beurze. Geschiedenis van de aandelenhandel in Belgi√´, 1300-1990, 1993, p. 15-32. T *Teatro Olimpico, designed in 1580 by Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio and located in Vicenza for the local Accademia Olimpica, is the first and oldest covered stable theatre of the modern era. Since 1994, the Teatro Olimpico, together with other Palladian buildings in and around Vicenza, has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto. * Telephone (originally named telettrofono). The Italian Antonio Meucci patented what became later known as the telephone. Official recognition arrived only after 113 years from his death. Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone after Meucci's patent had expired due to his poor economical condition and inability to renew the aforementioned patent. *Prepaid telephone card: the Italian phone company SIP (later becoming Telecom Italia) inaugurated the earliest pre-paid electronic phone cards in 1976, as a response to shortages of coin and theft of tokens and coins from public telephones. The invention of the phone card itself (soon after spread in Europe) dates 1975, introduced by the Italian SIDA and was initially used at a SIP public telephone center in Rome. Tim introduced the first prepaid sims in 1996. *Automatic telephone exchange, the first one being built for the Vatican in 1886 by Giovanni Battista Marzi. *Television (partially innovated): the Italian-American Augusto Bissiri was an early pioneer of the transmission of pictures, and is credited as an inventor of the television. His first short-distance transmission occurred in 1906, while his first intercontinental one dates 1917. In 1922 a system composed by disks, cathode-ray tube and screen is filed for patent; other improvements followed. Among other inventions, he developed a railway safety system and the Lettera Disco (lit. letter-disk), a voice recording device. In 1927 Philo Farnsworth performed the first transmission of a fully electronic image. Later, a legal battle broke out between him and V. Zworykin. *Thermojet: an early type of motorjet (jet engine) developed by Secondo Campini, whose prototype Caproni Campini N.1 has been the first (successful) publicly demonstrated jet airplane. He applied the motor-jet to boats too. Despite being abandoned in favor of turbojets, Campini' s work has inspired other new propulsion approaches. *Galileo thermometer, invented by Galileo Galilei in 1593. *Toffoli gate, a universal reversible logic gate invented by Tommaso Toffoli. *Public toilets: latrines were part of the sanitation system of ancient Rome, placed near or as part of public baths (thermae). During the Middle Ages sanitation partially regressed, to be reintroduced in Europe by Britain (WC or water-closet) and France. *Tontine, a form of life insurance developed by Lorenzo De Tonti in 1653. *Torpedo, invented by the Italian G. B. Luppis and perfected by the English R. Whitehead. *Touchpad (co-invented): Federico Faggin has been co-founder and CEO of Synaptics. He co-invented many patents assigned to Synaptics, which produced and commercialized the first touch-pad and the earliest touchscreens. In an interview, Faggin stated that Apple had been the first company to be truly interested on Synaptics' touchscreens, asking for the exclusive on the technology. The offer was declined; nonetheless the later success of iPhones and iPads opened a huge market for Synaptics. *Trimprob: used for the electromagnetic detection of cancerous tissue, was developed in 1992 by Italian engineer Clarbruno Vedruccio. *Triumphal Arch, the first recorded triumphal arches were set up in the time of the Roman Republic.\\"Triumphal arch.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2010) *Typewriter - in 1575 the venetian printer and bookseller Francesco Rampazetto created the first prototype of a machine that could impress letters on a piece of paper by means of \\"tactile writing\\". In 1714 the English engineer Henry Mill patented a typewriter without fabricating it. Early versions of the typewriter are reported in Austria in 1779 and Italy just after 1800 by Pellegrino Turri and Pietro Conti di Cilavegna. In 1855 Novara lawyer Giuseppe Ravizza built and patented the Cembalo scrivano or macchina da scrivere a tasti (lit. \\"key based typing machine\\"), modeling its keyboard design on the keys of pianoforte. The Cembalo Scrivano is recognized as the most advanced typing machine until the invention of Remington. Cembalo scrivano was also capable of printing upper and lower cases that didn't exist yet in the first Remington typewriter machine. **electronic typewriter: Olivetti ET 101 is the first Olivetti e. t. (1978) and is the first global- scale produced electronic typewriter.  U  * Unibody of Lancia Lambda, a car designed by Vincenzo Lancia and presented between 1921-'22. The vehicle introduced the fusion between chassis and bodywork, halving the weight compared to similar displacement cars and providing much higher resistance to impact in respect to traditional structures. Other new features included independent front suspension, allowing better safety, and a V-shaped overhead four cylinder engine. * University: the term comes from the Latin \\"universus\\", meaning \\"the whole / the universe\\", indicating a community of masters and scholars focused on higher learning concerning all - both secular and religious - human knowledge known to that date, namely Jurisprudence, Medicine, Philosophy and Theology. European academics attending the universities were expected to have already mastered the seven liberal arts, spanning from grammar to music and astronomy. The University of Bologna (founded around 1088 AD) is, by these standards, the first university of the world and, as its motto goes, 'Nourishing Mother of the Studies'. Many other universities started flourishing in Italy from the 13th century onward. Previous higher educational institutions existed during the Islamic Golden Age (the first one being the University of Karueein in 859 AD), focusing mainly on Islam (religion and laws) and only later obtaining the status of Universities. European universities themselves have, in part, religious origins, rooted in medieval Christian monastic schools and other institutions teaching theology. Finally, academies developed well before the Roman empire, with the most famous being depicted almost two millenniums later by Raphael: the school of Athens. Medieval universities are distinguished from the academies of the classical age by the particular legal recognition (i.e degree) they granted to those who completed the studies. V * Vault (partially innovated): the firsts vaults were either built underground or required continuous walls of great thickness to resist their thrust. Romans perfected the statics of the intersecting barrel vault, overcoming these limitations and pioneering the use of vaults over halls of great dimensions. * Vega (rocket): Italy had the lead in this program (65%), which produced an extremely fast vector to bring light payloads into orbit. First Launch was in 2012. *Venetian Carnival: carnival is an annual festival held in different places around the world, with an early example dating back in Venice to at least 1268. The most peculiar feature of Venice's celebration has laid in the extensive use of masks. The rite of Carneval has obscure origins, possibly Roman. * Vespa: in 1946 the Italian vehicle manufacturer Piaggio patented a \\"motorcycle of a rational complexity of organs and elements combined with a frame with mudguards and a casing covering the whole mechanical part\\". This design became one of the most popular scooters worldwide and is still in production. The Vespa had an inedited load-bearing bodywork. * Vibram - Vitale Bramani is credited with inventing the first rubber lug soles for shoes in 1937. * Vibram FiveFingers a type of shoe invented in 1999 by Robert Fliri. * Violin, four stringed, the name of the inventor is unknown, but the instrument appeared in renaissance Italy. *Viola (partially innovated): slightly larger than violin, is characterized by lower and deeper sound. Known fabrication started in northern Italy between 1530 and 1550. It is speculated that the 'Viola da gamba' was invented in Valencia, Spain, to be later introduced in Italy during Renaissance: a valencian painting representing a viola dates back to 1475. However, the viola is the oldest arched instrument, dating back, in different forms, to at least the 9th century. Ascribing the true origin of this instrument to specific geographical locations leads to questionable results. W * Watermark: this medieval innovation was first introduced in Fabriano, Italy, in 1282. * Welfare: the earliest form of welfare was the lex frumentaria instituted by the tribune Gaius Gracchus dating back to 122 B.C., a law that ordered Rome's government to supply its citizens with allotments of cheaply priced grain. * Galileo Hydrostatic Weighing Scale, a weight measuring device that uses hydraulic counter-force of a liquid, usually water or oil, to determine weight of an object under Archimedes' principle. Nowadays is mainly used in hydraulic types of weighbridges. Its functioning principles were first described by Galileo Galilei in 1586. Z * Zamboni pile - early electric battery * Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalyst, catalyst to produce polymers co-invented by Giulio Natta. Medical Discoveries and Techniques *Antibiotics: Vincenzo Tiberio is considered by notable sources to be discoverer of antibiotics. By 1895 the Italian physician had already observed, scientifically reproduced and written a research on the antibiotic effect of \\"cellular products, soluble in water\\" extracted from Penicillium glaucum, Mucor mucedo and Aspergillus flavescens and sterilized in the experimentation (both in vitro and in vivo). It can't be ruled out the possibility of his findings to have been taken as a starting point for later European researches. **Mycophenolic acid, the first fungi-derived cristallized antibiotic, discovered by Bartolomeo Gosio, who is also known for his research on the toxic Gosio gas. **Rifampicin, an antibacterial drug discovered by a team led by Prof. Piero Sensi at Lepetit Pharmaceuticals in 1957 in Milan, Italy. **Cephalosporins antibiotics. Discovered by Giuseppe Brotzu in 1948.Podolsky, M. Lawrence (1998) Cures Out of Chaos: How Unexpected Discoveries Led to Breakthroughs in Medicine and Health, Harwood Academic Publishers *Artificial insemination, although previously theorized, only in 1784 the first artificial insemination in a viviparous animal was officially performed and reported by the Italian physiologist Lazzaro Spallanzani. *Black reaction: a silver staining technique which was first performed by Camillo Golgi. It helped the study of the nerve cells. *Blood circulation: since Galen times it was believed that the internal human body circulation was separated in two different circuits: veins system, carrying food to the body, and arteries system, responsible for the flowing pneuma or \\"circulating air\\" in the body that was necessary to vital functions. Although many beliefs of Galen have been disproved by many Italian anatomists during Renaissance, the first who guessed blood did not mix in the heart and, instead, formed a single circulating system passing through the lungs, was the Spanish physician Miguel Serveto. However, his works were largely unknown for a long time as he was burned at the stake with his books for heresy by order of the city's governing council of Geneva, and it was an Italian anatomy professor, Realdo Colombo, who validated the intuitions of Servetus, proving that cardiac septum is impermeable to blood. He also spoke correctly about the existence of pulmonary circulation. Girolamo Fabrizi d‚ÄôAcquapendente (1537-1619) was the first to study the valves of the veins, but it was Andrea Cesalpino the one who described the circulation of blood in the body. Cesalpino showed that the heart, not the liver, is the engine that physically pumps the blood into the vessels: starting from the arteries to capillaries, blood reaches the whole body, then it returns through the veins up to the heart. He used for the first time the term blood circulation and he demonstrated that in veins and arteries flows only blood, not pneuma, and that the passage of blood from arteries to veins through capillaries is due to difference of pressure. It remains famous his experiment of ligature of veins then resumed by William Harvey in order to prove the blood flow course in veins. Finally, Marcello Malpighi gave with his microscope observational proof of the exchange of blood from arteries to veins in capillaries. *Cerebrospinal fluid: the physician Domenico Cotugno is credited with the discovery of this fluid in 1774. *DDrna: a class of small non-coding RNAs (abbreviated DDRNAs) unveiled in a study by Fabrizio d'Adda di Fagagna, which play an important role in the activation of DDR, and in turn, as previously discovered by F. Fagagna, in the proliferation's inhibition typical of cellular aging. *Gastric digestion (scientific proof): Edward Stevens for the first time performed an in vitro digestion. Spallanzani interpreted the process of digestion not simply as a mechanical process, but as one of actual solution, chemically mediated by the acid gastric juice of the stomach. *Eustachian tube: Bartolomeo Eustachi extended the knowledge of the internal ear by rediscovering and describing correctly the tube that bears his name. He is the first who described the internal and anterior muscles of the malleus and the stapedius, and the complicated figure of the cochlea. *Fallopian tube: Gabriele Falloppio studied the reproductive organs in both sexes, and described the tube, which leads from the ovary to the uterus and now bears his name. He was the first to describe a condom (in his writings, a linen sheath wrapped around the penis), and he advocated the use of such sheaths to prevent syphilis. *Germ theory of disease (as a scientific theory): physician Girolamo Fracastoro, scholar and poet, in 1546 was the first proposing that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable tiny particles or \\"spores\\" that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact or even without contact over long distances. In his idea the \\"spores\\" of diseases may refer to either chemicals or living entities. He appears to have first used the Latin word fomes, meaning tinder, in the sense of infectious agent. He was the one to christen the syphilis disease with this name, from the name of a young boy Syphilius in Greek mythology, who was punished with an horrible disease for he had offended Apollo. Fracastoro also gave the first scientific description of typhus. The lunar crater Fracastorius is named after him. * Golgi apparatus, an organelle of the eukaryotic cell, discovered by Camillo Golgi in 1897. * HIV Virus (co-discovered): the French Luc Montagnier and the Italian American Robert Charles Gallo (US-born) are credited with discovering the virus causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). * Human Genome Diversity Project (or HGDP): a research project started by Stanford University's Morrison Institute in 1990s along with collaboration of scientists around the world. It has been the result of many years of work by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza. *Insulin, artificial synthesis (contribution in discovery): the Italian Roberto Crea was part of a team of ten Genentech scientists publishing in 1979 a research that described the solution for synthetic insulin, obtained through genes (coding the protein insulin A and B) that were inserted in Escherichia coli bacteria. This technique made possible the mass production of insulin without relying on extraction from animals sources. *Liposuction, medical procedure invented by Dr Giorgio Fischer in 1974. *Malaria transmission, discovered by Amico Bignami to be originated by mosquitoes as infecting vectors. *Mirror Neurons, being activated in a subject following either his own actions or the ones of another observed actor. These kinds of neurons were discovered by a team of Italian scientists led by Giacomo Rizzolatti. *MS4A4A, discovered by an Italian research, this molecule plays a central role in the dialogue between Natural Killer and macrophage cells, controlling the tumoral metastatic diffusion. *NGF or nerve growth factor, a protein involved primarily in the growth, as well as the maintenance, proliferation, and survival of nerve cells, whose absence leads to various diseases. Co- discovered in the early 1950s by Rita Levi-Montalcini in collaboration with Stanley Cohen. Today, NGF and its relatives are collectively designated as neurotrophins and are extensively studied for their role in mediating multiple biological phenomena. *Octopamine, discovered by Vittorio Erspamer. * Oncovirus, type of virus capable of causing cancers. The experiments led by Italian-American Renato Dulbecco and his group demonstrated that the genes of the reverse transcribing viruses infecting the cells, are inoculated into their chromosomes, with a behavior that alternates phases of inactivity and activity, linked to the formation of tumors. Nobel price was awarded to Renato Dulbecco, David Baltimore and Howard Temin. In 1986 R. Dulbecco proposed the Human Genome Project to the international community, with the subsequent project initiation by the Italian CNR (National Research Council). * Piezoelectric surgery, a surgery technique developed by Tomaso Vercellotti. *Pneumothorax induction as an early method of treating tuberculosis, nowadays abandoned, proposed by Carlo Forlanini. *Ricordi Chamber: doctor Camillo Ricordi -director of Diabetes Research Center (DRI), and Cell Transplant Center of University of Miami- became one of highest authorities in the cure of diabetes disease; he developed the first device able to isolate large quantities of insulin-producing cells from the human pancreas and to have successfully conducted the first series of pancreatic islets transplants capable of treating diabetes. His procedures have been used worldwide. *Robotic Hand Prosthesis (permanent implant on humans): the first prototype of an artificial, poly-articulated and sensitive hand was made in Italy, with a real-time decoding of the electrical signals sent from the brain to the muscles. *Sarcoptes scabiei: discovered by Giacinto Cestoni and Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo (in 1687) and identified as the disease-causing agent of scabies. Bonomo also developed the cure: bathing in antiseptic. Parasitology had other fundamental advancements thanks to the research of Francesco Redi, pioneering the subsequent invalidation of spontaneous generation. *SARS virus, an infectious disease discovered by Carlo Urbani; having being infected, he didn't live long enough to see how effective his early detection and intervention was in buying time and saving lives. *Serotonin, discovered and synthesized by Italian chemist and pharmacologist Vittorio Erspamer. *(Spinal) biomechanics: Giovanni A. Borelli is often considered father of biomechanics, having calculated the forces necessary in the human body for reaching the equilibrium in the joints, long before the publishing of the Newtonian Laws. Borelli first understood that it is the motion to be magnified by the locomotor system's levers rather than force and consequently motion-producing muscles have to explicate greater force compared to the motion-resisting entities. It's worth mentioning B. ideated what is probably the first rebreather. * Stem cells as vectors for Gene Therapy: in 1992 doctor Claudio Bordignon, working at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan, performed the first procedure of gene therapy using hematopoietic stem cells as vectors delivering genes intended to correct hereditary diseases.Gene therapy. Italians first to use stem cells. Abbott A. Nature. 9 April 1992;356(6369):465 He is known for having validated many successful gene therapy protocols targeting genetic and acquired disorders, such as leukaemias. * Striated muscles, first differentiated from smooth muscles by Giorgio Baglivi in his monograph De fibra motrice. An exponent of iatrophysics, he isolated muscle fibers and studied them using a compound microscope, outlining the fundamental role played by the fiber as a structure. He also concluded that the heart muscle had spontaneous contraction, independent from other innervations. His depiction of pulmonary edema is credited as its first proper clinical description. In addition, he proposed the introduction of specialized medical degrees. *Strimvelis: the first ex- vivo stem cell gene therapy to treat patients with a very rare disease called ADA-SCID. The treatment was developed at San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), in Milan. Strimvelis has been approved in Europe for the treatment of human patients. *Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS), with the first recorded clinical application by Giovanni Aldini in 1803.\\"AIM25 text-only browsing: Royal College of Surgeons of England: Aldini, Giovanni: Notebook\\". Aim25.ac.uk. Retrieved 2012-08-05. * Rappuoli (innovated) vaccines, covering more than 150 patent families that have been registered since the mid-1990s by Rino Rappuoli, radically changing the vaccine production procedures used to immunize millions of people. **Reverse vaccinology, a new method for making vaccines using the pathogen's sequenced genome, pioneered by R. Rappuoli and the J. Craig Venter Institute.Alessandro S, Rino R. Review: Reverse Vaccinology: Developing Vaccines in the Era of Genomics. Immunity [serial online]. n.d.;33:530-541. Available from: ScienceDirect, Ipswich, MA. Rappuoli has continued researching for even more advanced techniques. **Recombinant pertussis vaccine (1992), with genetic editing and inactivation of the toxic gene in the chromosome of Pertussis bacterium, so that a non-toxic molecule is produced instead. The immune response was reported to improve compared to previous conventional technologies. *CAd3-ZEBOV: an experimental Ebola virus vaccine developed by Swiss-Italian biotechnology company Okairos under the leadership of Dr Riccardo Cortese, in collaboration with American Nih. Okairos was later incorporated into GlaxoSmithKline. *Trotula: Trota De Ruggiero (or Trocta) was a medical practitioner, probably a regular physician and university Professor who lived in the early 12th century in Salerno, near Naples. It seems she was daughter of one of the private Professors of the Schola Medica Salernitana, following her father's steps as a physician and teacher of medicine, and whose progeny continued this tradition as well. It is uncertain whether she was the first woman of the Medieval age to become a graduated physician in the Western World, but it is well known from various sources that at least 24 women practiced surgery in Neapolitan Area during Middle Ages. Trota left a collection of writings about the cure of women illnesses in a codex named after her, Trotula. It consists of three manuscripts, of which only the book called De curis mulierum (lit. \\"On Treatments for Women\\") is attributed to her, while the other two are works of different authors. The fact she wrote such an organic collection of remedies and cures is one of the evidences suggesting she was a regular graduate and not a simple practitioner. The Schola Medica Salernitana is considered \\"the oldest medical school of modern civilization\\" and \\"forerunner of modern University Medical Schools\\". *VEGF: Napoleone Ferrara isolated and cloned the 'vascular endothelial growth factor' in 1989, while working at Genentech. He is credited with developing a whole new class of anti-VEGF drugs for cancer treatment. He had a leading role in the development of ranibizumab, a drug intended for macular degeneration. Law, Philosophy and Humanities * Colony, from the Latin \\"colonia\\", indicating a Roman outpost established to secure conquered territory (sometimes situated near previous settlements) and built for retired Roman legionaries. Colonies have been part of a Roman policy \\"whose wisdom only the future could fully reveal\\"-(Cedric A. Yeo,The Classical World). Eventually the term denoted the highest status of a Roman city. Many colonies survived the fall of Rome, with some becoming seminal European cities (e.g London, Paris, Barcelona, Frankfurt). The map of Roman infrastructures manifests a remarkable pattern similarity with European road density today: ancient cities and roads might have set the template for the next two thousand years of economic development. *Cosmology of Giordano Bruno: he expanded the relatively new Copernican theory proposing for the first time the idea that the stars were distant suns (as bodies emitting energy) surrounded by their own planets (as bodies receiving and reflecting energy) orbiting around. According to Steven Soter \\"[this] is arguably the greatest idea in the history of astronomy\\". Giordano raised the possibility that these planets might foster life of their own, a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism; he also claimed the universe is infinite and could have no \\"center\\". Barely suffering any form of religious authority, he was excommunicated by three different Christian cults: Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists. In his positions Bruno identified God as a God-Nature, as a reality that in itself subsists immanent in the guise of the Infinite, since infinity is the fundamental characteristic of the divine. For this reason and other beliefs considered heretic by the Catholic Church, such as negating Holy Trinity, he was dragged into court in Venice by local Inquisition, where he skillfully tried to defend himself stating that philosophers in their course of thoughts, according to \\"the natural light of intellect\\", can come to conflicting conclusions with the matters of faith, without having to be considered heretics. Roman Inquisition asked for his extradition to Rome, that was exceptionally granted by the Venetian Senate, and in Rome Bruno decided to not defend himself anymore and instead openly declare his beliefs. Found guilty of heresy, he was burned at the stake. *Fermi paradox: arising from the high probability of existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and yet absence of alien contacts (given the great number of stars and planets of our galaxy and billions of years of time for hypothetical civilizations to develop space travel). Herbert York wrote in 1984 that Fermi \\"followed up with a series of calculations on the probability of earthlike planets, the probability of life given an earth, the probability of humans given life, the likely rise and duration of high technology, and so on. He concluded on the basis of such calculations that we ought to have been visited long ago and many times over\\".\\"Where is everybody?: An account of Fermi's question\\", Dr. Eric M. Jones, Los Alamos technical report, March 1985. Jones wrote to Teller on 13 July 1984, York on 4 September, and Konopinski on 24 September 1984. *Criminology: **Classical theory: Cesare Beccaria is credited with starting the school of classical theory on crime in his fundamental work On Crimes and Punishments. **Positivist theory: founded by Raffaele Garofalo, Enrico Ferri and Cesare Lombroso, the latter being prominent in criminal anthropology. *Doctoral degree for women: Elena Cornaro Piscopia was a Venetian noble woman, and scholar who in 1678 became the first woman in modern history to receive an official academic degree from a university, and the first to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree. Laura Bassi was the second woman to achieve such a degree, and Cristina Roccati the third one. *Fascism: illiberal political movement characterized as a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism, created by politician and then dictator Benito Mussolini. *Futurism: an artistic and social movement born in Italy in the early 20th century, that glorified modernity, emphasized speed, technology, youth, impetuosity, and iconic objects of modernity and speed such as internal combustion engines, the car and the airplane as a form of art, an ideal of beauty and trendy absolute ambition for manly boldness. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti was the most prominent figure of the movement. *Humanism: a broad concept present in different cultures, derives its term from the Latin \\"humanitas\\", developed during Roman times (see Aulus Gellius). *International law: (Italy-born) British-Italian Alberico Gentili is regarded as one of the founders of Int. Law, together with Francisco de Vitoria and Hugo Grotius.Julius J. Marke (1999). A Catalogue of the Law Collection at New York University: With Selected Annotations. New York, USA: Lawbook Exchange Ltd. p. 1372. . *Latin alphabet, derived from the Greek alphabet; became the foundation of many languages worldwide, e.g. Neo-Latin languages. Currently more than 4.9 billion people rely on this alphabet. *Machiavellianism: term denoting the political philosophy of Machiavelli, especially regarding his most famous work, Il Principe, or The Prince. The book advocated realpolitik and a consequentialist approach to political action, recommending rulers to be ready to act in deceitful ways, such as resorting to fraud, treachery and elimination of political opponents, and to use fear as a means of controlling subjects, in order to retain a ruler's power and security in the state. *Renaissance humanism: a cultural movement of rebirth in the study of classical antiquity, originating in Italy and then spreading across Western Europe (around 1300-1500). Humanists perceived themselves as a different kind of men opposed to those who lived in medieval age and who had another vision of the world, science and literature, rougher and incomplete if compared to the humanistic rediscovery of ancient classics, new perception of nature of things, and a new way of conceiving arts and beauty. *Roman Law: together with the Napoleonic Law,Andrew Roberts, Napoleon: A Life (2014), p. xxxiii. Quote: \\"The ideas that underpin our modern world‚Äîmeritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on‚Äîwere championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the fall of the Roman Empire\\" represents the foundation for the Civil Law, now adopted by 150 countries. Ancient Roman Law influenced to some extent the following medieval Common Law. **Adoption, as legal process of parenting another person and permanently transferring all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation and full rights for the adopted of inheriting family name and family legacies. Institution of adoption was widely used by Roman Emperors to grant themselves an heir of male gender. **Habeas Corpus's origins, which can be traced back to the Roman Law. **Marriage as a legal transaction between two peoples as stated by Roman law, sometimes involving the adoption of a prenuptial agreement. **Municipium, a social contract between municipes, the \\"duty holders,\\" or citizens of the town: the munera were a communal obligation of the municipes in exchange for privileges and protections of citizenship.Frank Frost Abbott, Municipal Administration in the Roman Empire (1926), Read Books, 2007, p.8 The continuation in the Middle Ages of municipal institutes of Roman derivation constituted, together with the feudal fragmentation and the mechanisms of association of bourgeois origin, one of the determining factors for the formation of the communes. They developed as autonomous and recognized forms of city government, of an economic nature and, particularly in Italy, political. **Proprietas: in ancient Roman legal system, indicates the sum of powers, rights and privileges, of a person on a thing. The seminal distinction between laws of property and obligation has characterized all Western Civilization. Historically, Democritus justified private property because it was efficient. Aristotle added the argument of human nature. Etruscans and Romans perceived private property as the bond of the family with the ancestors and gods. *Runic alphabet: the runic alphabet was based on Old Italic script. *Sonnet: type of poetry originating in Italy and highly developed by Francesco Petrarca. *Scholasticism **(as a philosophy): a school of thought that employed a critical method of analysis and tried to reconcile the Christian faith with a system of rational thought (mainly derived from Greek philosophy), integrating classical philosophy as anticipating Christian theology. The intent of the scholastics was to develop a harmonious knowledge, integrating the Christian revelation with the philosophical systems of the Greek-Hellenistic world, as they were convinced of their compatibility, and to seek in the knowledge of the classics (mainly from great thinkers such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus) a route able to raise the acceptance of Catholic dogmas. Scholasticism started developing from the works of the Roman Boethius at the very onset of the Middle Ages. **(as a method of organizing studies): an organization of higher education present in ancient schools and universities. Clergymen and secular literates usually started their cursus studiorum in capitular schools enclosed by abbeys and monasteries, learning the arts of Trivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric) and then proceeding in the arts of Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). King Lothair I of Italy, nephew of emperor Charlemagne, created a system of high schools in strategic cities of his reign (Pavia, Ivrea, Turin, Cremona, Florence, Fermo, Verona, Vicenza, Forl√¨) in order to train skilled officials and bureaucrats. Italian merchant cities enhanced the schooling system by creating, around 1100, the \\"Scuole d'Abaco\\" (abacus learning schools) as professional institutes intended for the preparation of accountants, clerks, and any sort of trading specialists. * Theory of the two Suns: a political theory developed by Dante Alighieri, expecially in the De Monarchia, advocating the autonomy of the temporal power of the Holy Roman Emperor from the spiritual power of the Pope. Dante has been defined by William Franke \\"pioneer and prophet of Christian Secularism\\". Math and Physical Sciences= Theories, Methods and Models  * Introduction of Indo-Arabic Numbers in Europe: Leonardo Fibonacci da Pisa (or Leonardo Pisano), arguably the most talented mathematician of Middle Ages, in his book Liber Abaci (1202) introduced the arab numbers in the Western World, which was still relying on Roman numerals. He is also famous for the Fibonacci Sequence of numbers, as he used this sequence to calculate the growth of an ideal rabbit population in order to foresee its expansion. Sequence first mentions are from Indian mathematics. Much later, Lagrange will discover the Pisano periods of the sequence. *Introduction of non-euclidean geometry in Europe: the first notable work investigating Euclid's Fifth Postulate was written by Persian Omar Khayy√°m in the 11th century. At the very end of the 17th century, the Italian Giovanni G. Saccheri resumed the concept of Khayyam‚ÄìSaccheri quadrilateral in order to prove the fifth postulate, ultimately in vain. However, Saccheri became, quite unintentionally, discoverer and forerunner of non-euclidean geometries. In his demonstrative effort, he came to the description of the various properties of hyperbolic lines, subdividing the straight lines into three distinct classes: incident, asymptotic and ultraparallel. Furthermore, he outlined the fundamental concept of angle of parallelism. Later, fathers of hyperbolic geometry were Gauss, Janos Bolyai, and Lobachevsky. *Scientific method (consisting of observation through quantification, hypothesis and testings of models): was theorized by Galileo Galilei, recognized as 'the father of modern science, physics and astronomy'. Galilei wanted to reach whatever conclusions a scrupulous and methodical analysis of evidence suggests rather than seeking exclusively the aspects of reality confirming and conforming to a specific orthodoxy. Galileo‚Äôs method and discoveries represented the focal point for the European scientific revolution in the 17th century. He invalidated a belief system that parted the ancient world from modernity. Galileo revolutionized the goal of science: to research the mathematical properties of substances, such as 'location, motion, shape, size, opacity, mutability, generation and dissolution', instead of their intrinsic essence. *Galilean relativity (the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame): this seminal principle, defined by Galileo, was perfected and expanded during the following centuries. For example, Einstein's theory of special relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in any inertial frame, and, in particular, any measurement of the speed of light in any inertial frame will always be constant (around 300000 Km/s). *Law of inertia: a body having constant (k=0 v k>0) velocity, will retain its vector unless a force (f>0) acts upon it. Defined by Galileo for horizontal motion. *Uniformly accelerated motion: correctly described for falling bodies from height h using an inclined plane by Galilei in d(distance) = k(constant)*t 2 (or d ‚àù t 2) , v(velocity) ‚àù t , v ‚àù h1/2, with the specific mass of the bodies being irrelevant. Previously, William Heytesbury described the earliest mathematical relationship of motion with constant acceleration; with Nicole Oresme and Giovanni di Casali providing graphical demonstration of Heytesbury's statement.Clagett, Marshall (1961) The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 332‚Äì45, 382‚Äì91. *Isochronism of the pendulum: Galileo proposed this principle and illustrated a mechanical clock using the pendulum, with C. Huygens formulating the isochronism properlyNewton, R. G. (2004). Galileo's Pendulum: From the Rhythm of Time to the Making of Matter. Harvard University Press. p. 51. . and credited as inventor of the pendulum clock. Controversy sparkled between Vincenzo Viviani and Huygens about the paternity of the invention. *Italian school of algebraic geometry: being formed between 1891-1912, especially thanks to Corrado Segre, the school grouped several brilliant students and academics. C. Segre works focused mainly on algebraic geometry, being known for Segre classification, Segre cubic, Segre embedding, Segre surface, Zeuthen‚ÄìSegre invariant (first discovered by Zeuthen). Other notable exponents of this school have been F. Enriques, F. Severi, G. Castelnuovo and G. Veronese; to these shall not be omitted the Polish mathematician O. Zariski. The school was composed by mathematicians interested in converging topics, who gave pivotal contributions to the development of the algebraic-geometric field particularly in the classification of algebraic surfaces, proceeding from the previous works of Alexander von Brill, M. Noether and Luigi Cremona. *Algebra (from Arab al jabr): works such as Algebra by Raffaele Bombelli, 'Ars Magna' by Gerolamo Cardano and 'General trattato di numeri et misure' by Niccol√≤ Tartaglia pioneered a systematic diffusion in didactic form of mathematical knowledge, introducing, for instance, the solution of third degree equations, imaginary numbers and operations within the set of complex numbers. Indian Brahmagupta had already solved 2nd degree equations. *Ballistics: the discipline of ballistics was initially studied and developed by Italian mathematician Niccolo TartagliaNiccolo' Tartaglia, Nova Scientia, 1537. (a treatise on gunnery and ballistics). *Ruffini's rule: a practical method developed by Paolo Ruffini allowing the factorization of polynomials (without degree limitation) as products of binomials, provided they meet particular conditions defined by the Ruffini's theorem. *Mathematical analysis: Evangelista Torricelli's work in geometry and Cavalieri's principle, using the method of indivisibles and infinitesimals, paved the way for integral calculus (e.g. Bonaventura Cavalieri solved \\\\textstyle \\\\int_{0}^{a} \\\\displaystyle x^n), which was later predominantly developed by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. This method allowed the two Italian mathematicians to obtain simply and rapidly the area and volume of several geometric figures, including solids of revolution. Torricelli expanded Cavalieri's method to include curved indivisibles: the improvement consisted in the confrontation between two planar figures broken down using, respectively, rectilinear indivisibles for one and curved indivisibles (i.e curves of infinitesimal thickness) for the other. If each curved indivisible has the same extension of the associated rectilinear indivisible then the areas of the two figures are equal. More dramatically, studying the curve describing distance as a function of time, Torricelli understood the concept of instant velocity as the tangent of a point on the curve forming an angle with the x axis.https://amslaurea.unibo.it/13819/1/GiorgiaLari.pdf Lari, Giorgia (2016) \\"Storia del calcolo differenziale e la disputa tra Leibniz e Newton, Tesi di Laurea in Storia della Matematica\\" \\" Translation from source There are two origins of the derivative: geometrical (the tangent problem), with Descartes and Fermat, and mechanics (the determination of the velocity of a varied motion), with Galileo, Torricelli and Barrow.\\" He intuited derivatives and, implicitly, the inverse character of integration and derivation. The fundamental theorem of calculus was explicitly enunciated by Isaac Barrow (thus called T.-Barrow theorem). Barrow himself mentioned Galileo, Cavalieri, and Torricelli. Eventually, the theorem received formal demonstration by Isaac Newton. *Torricelli's trumpet: E.Torricelli researched the apparently contradicting properties (at least for his time) of a solid of revolution with finite volume (calculated by Torricelli to be œÄ/a, with a value of abscissa) and yet infinite surface, obtained when the curve y=1/x for x=1 v x>1 is rotated in 3-space about the x-axis. In recognition for his works on infinitesimal geometry he was referred to as 'the highest geometer', in the century when Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Huygens lived too. He calculated the coordinates of the center of gravity of geometric figures through the quotient of two definite integrals, developing a \\"universal theorem‚Äù nowadays still considered the most general possible. He introduced the curved indivisibles, that is the integration by substitution and the use of curvilinear coordinates, and, along with Fermat, worked towards the generalization of the Cavalieri's quadrature formula (solving the case of higher hyperbolae). Among other things, Torricelli calculated the volume of solids formed by any lateral surface and limited by two plane surfaces (e.g: the volume of barrels). He also solved the Torricelli‚ÄìFermat point, worked with Roberval on the cycloid (its quadrature, center of gravity, and rotational solid), and researched the ballistic trajectories. *Logarithmic spiral: was conceived and graphically rectified by Torricelli, up to its center, to which the curve tends after infinite revolutions. Torricelli substituted the \\"potential infinite and infinitesimal\\" of the Greeks with the \\"actual infinite and infinitesimal\\". *Fano resonance: discovered by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana, and named after Italian-American Ugo Fano, who produced a theoretical explanation of the phenomenon.\\" A. Bianconi Ugo Fano and shape resonances in X-ray and Inner Shell Processes\\" AIP Conference Proceedings (2002): (19th Int. Conference Roma June 24‚Äì28, 2002) A. Bianconi arXiv: cond-mat/0211452 21 November 2002 U. Fano is also known for Feshbach‚ÄìFano partitioning, Fano factor, Fano noise, Lu‚ÄìFano plot, Fano effect, Fano‚ÄìLichten mechanism, Beutler-Fano profile and Fano's theorem. *Fubini's theorem: a result defining the conditions under which is possible to calculate a double integral by using iterated integral, described by Guido Fubini. He is also known for developing the Fubini-Study metrics in 1904,G. Fubini, \\"Sulle metriche definite da una forme Hermitiana\\", (1904) Atti del Reale Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti , 63 pp. 502‚Äì513 with Eduard Study describing the same just one year later, in 1905.E. Study, \\"K√ºrzeste Wege im komplexen Gebiet\\", (1905) Math. Ann., 60 pp. 321‚Äì378 Fubini opened new paths in the areas of analysis, geometry and mathematical physics. *Functional analysis: Vito Volterra is considered founder of this branch of mathematics. He developed a general theory of functionals, i.e. functions of functions, not to be confused with function composition, and his works are credited with having a generous influence on modern calculus (e.g. harmonic integrals). Volterra also applied his analytics to the theories of elasticity, distortion and electromagnetism. He independently co-developed the predator-prey model. *Peano axioms, defining the arithmetical properties for the set of natural numbers N; these postulates were proposed by Giuseppe Peano, a founder of mathematical logic and set theory. He wrote Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita; common mathematical symbols have been introduced by or are derived from his work, such as ‚àà, ‚äÇ, ‚à©, ‚à™, and A‚àíB. He is also known for having developed the Peano curve, the Peano existence theorem, the Peano- Jordan measure, the Peano kernel theorem, the Peano‚ÄìRussell notation and the Peano form of the remainder for the Taylor's theorem. His contributions spanned from geometry, mathematical analysis and vector calculus to logic and the indagation of principles. *Probability calculus: initiated in Europe by Italian mathematicians, statistics and probability met general and systematic theorization with Pascal and Fermat. Cardano, for instance, enunciated what is possibly the first definition of classical probability. Permutation and combination had already been used by Arab mathematicians. *Tensor calculus: extension of vector calculus to tensor fields, allowing expression of physics equations in a form that is independent of the choice of coordinates on a manifold, such as space-time. It was developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita. Later, it constituted a critical tool used by Albert Einstein to develop his theory of relativity. *Classical and celestial mechanics: Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia improved the Newtonian mechanics formulating what is known as Lagrangian mechanics, introducing the concepts of generalized coordinates, potential (i.e gravitational or electrical field) and Lagrangian orbits. *Group theory: Lagrange's theorem of groups (a subgroup‚Äôs order must always divide the order of the group exactly) represents one of the earliest steps in the theory of groups. Lagrange is considered a founder of group theory, along with Niels Henrik Abel and √âvariste Galois. *Hydrodynamics **Winds (in scientific terms): explained by Torricelli as an atmospheric phenomenon consisting of movements of air masses \\"produced by differences of air temperature, and hence density, between two regions of the earth\\". He wrote \\"we live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of air\\".Walker, Gabrielle (2010). An Ocean of Air: A Natural History of the Atmosphere. London: Bloomsbury. **Torricelli also described fluids with the Torricelli's law, a particular case of Bernoulli's principle; his work was so important that Ernst Mach considered T. \\"founder of hydrodynamics\\". **Venturi effect: fluid pressure is reduced when a fluid flows in a more constricted section of a pipe. Discovered by the Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Venturi. *Avogadro principle: equal volumes of all (ideal) gases, at the same temperature and pressure, have the same number of particles (atoms or molecules). *Law of Capacitance: Q(quantity of charge) = C(capacitance) * V(tension or voltage), discovered by Alessandro Volta (its proper formulation is: Q ‚àù V). *Mercalli scale, developed by volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli, classifies the intensity of an earthquake based on its visible effects on buildings. *Metallurgy (innovated): Pirotechnia by Vannoccio Biringuccio (1540) represents the first book (and the first printed) totally dedicated to metallurgy, elements and techniques. V. Biringuccio is regarded as \\"the first true foundryman and the father of the foundry industry\\". Prior to his publication, foundry techniques were kept as a secret and generally handed down orally: Pirotechnia is the starting point for a true technological literature, interested in experimental fact and method, of which Biringuccio is considered an important exponent (also see Bernardino Telesio and Francis Bacon). *Milky Way (in scientific terms): Galileo observed, described and theorized our galaxy as a collection of a tremendous amount of stars. *Paleontology: although mainly known for his artistic endeavors, Leonardo da Vinci was paleontology's founding father (also see Science of Leonardo da Vinci, about Leonardo's visionary research). *Paleoceanography, Cesare Emiliani is considered founder of this field of science, having discovered that deep oceans are not immutable environments: they have oscillated considerably in temperature over geological ages. *CKM Matrix: a unitary matrix containing information about the strength of the flavour-changing weak interaction. The first version of the matrix was developed in 1963 by Nicola Cabibbo -renowned physicist and later president of the Pontifical Academy of Science- and was subsequently completed by the Japanese Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa. Nobel Price was awarded to the latter two omitting the former. Cabibbo's work helped in understanding the violation of an almost exact symmetry of charge and parity between particles and the corresponding antiparticles, called Cp violation. It is hypothesized matter and anti-matter to be present in equal quantities at the beginning of the universe. The violation could help explain why matter is now far more abundant than antimatter. *Quantum loop theory: the Italian theoretical physicist and writer Carlo Rovelli is one of the founders of this quantum theory of gravity, together with Lee Smolin and Abhay Ashtekar. The theory is aimed at merging the general relativity with quantum mechanics. Furthermore, C. Rovelli and French mathematician Alain Connes put forward the thermal time hypothesis in order to solve the problem of time. *Relational quantum mechanics: interpretation of the state of a quantum system as the relation between the observer and the system, introduced by C. Rovelli.Rovelli, C. (1996), \\"Relational quantum mechanics\\", International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 35: 1637‚Äì1678. *Viterbi algorithm, developed by the Italian-American Andrea Viterbi, found useful applications in mobile phones. *Gini Index: often used in economy and statistics to define, among the units of a community, the global measure of the inequality in income's distribution. *Least absolute deviations: a statistical technique introduced by Serbian-Italian, Croatian and European scientist Ruggero Giuseppe Boscovich.\\"Least Absolute Deviation Regression\\". The Concise Encyclopedia of Statistics. Springer. 2008. pp. 299‚Äì302. doi:10.1007/978-0-387-32833-1_225. . His physical theories would influence Hamilton.  Particles  * Astatine (co-discovered, in US): Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Emilio Segr√® are credited with isolating the element in 1940. * Methane, the simplest hydrocarbon, isolated and studied for its inflammable properties by Alessandro Volta. He also demonstrated interests in the ignition of other inflammable gases through electric sparks, designing a rudimentary electric pistol. * Technetium (Tc): in 1937 two Italian scientists - Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segr√® - produced technetium-97, the first artificial element. Segr√® and Glenn T. Seaborg later isolated the metastable isotope Tc-99m that, having just a 6-hour half-life, found useful applications in medical radiographic scanning. * Antiproton: co- discovered in a 1955 by Emilio Segr√® and Owen Chamberlain, both awarded with Nobel Prize. They brought experimental evidence of the existence of the proton's antiparticle. *W and Z bosons (collaboration in discovery): discovered by Cern's UA1 and UA2. In 1976 Carlo Rubbia, Peter McIntyre and David Cline suggested the creation of the CERN's proton-antiproton collider. C. Rubbia led a team of physicists in the UA1 Collaboration, managing the construction of the central detector, which allowed to obtain experimental evidence of the bosons in 1982-'83; in November 1982 the first W candidate was found; the discovery was reported during a workshop in Rome the following year (12-14 January) and then internationally. Simon van der Meer contribution has been vital for stocking large quantities of anti-protons. Both S. Meer and C. Rubbia have been awarded with the Nobel price.  Astronomical Discoveries  *Ceres: father Giuseppe Piazzi was the first to discover an asteroid he called Ceres, the major object in the Asteroid belt of the Solar system, and considered a dwarf planet by modern astronomic terminology. He cataloged 7,646 stars, demonstrating that most stars are in relative motion to the Sun. He also discovered the proper motion of the double star 61 Cygni. The asteroid 1000 Piazzia and a Moon's crater have been christened with his name. *Jupiter moons, discovered in 1610 and named by Galileo Galilei thanks to his enhanced telescope. These moons were found orbiting around Jupiter. If the Aristotelic geocentric theory had been correct, then these moons could not have existed. This discovery, along with his observation of the phases of Venus, gave proof of a heliocentric universe. * Jupiter Great Red Spot, observed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. *Lagrangian orbits: mathematician and astronomer Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia, also known as Joseph Louis Lagrange, was one of the creators of the calculus of variations and discovered the points of libration in a planetary orbit, now called Lagrangian Points, by studying the astronomic and mathematic problem of calculating the evolution during time of three celestial bodies (such as Sun, Earth and Moon) concurrent orbits. *Moon's mountains and valleys, observed by Galileo. These observations led to a radical change from obsolete Aristotelian theories (considering the celestial realm unchanging and eternal). *Meteor shower's origin, demonstrated by Giovanni Schiaparelli to be the remnants of comets. He also conducted studies on double stars, Mercury, Venus, and Mars (describing its canals). *Saturn rings, planar rings of icy particles orbiting Saturn; they were first spotted by Galileo, although their true nature has been unveiled only later. *Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus, four of the main moons of Saturn, were discovered by G. Cassini. *Sun spots, dark spots on the surface of the Sun visibly contrasting with the surrounding region, discovered by Galilei. *Cosmic rays (contribution in discovery): Domenico Pacini pioneered the discovery of cosmic rays by experimentally proving such radioactivity could not originate from within the Earth. Other scientists involved in their discovery are Victor Franz Hess and Theodor Wulf. *X-ray source outside the solar system: discovered for the first time in 1962 by the Nobel-awarded Riccardo Giacconi and his team, researching in the United States; Scorpius-X1. Giacconi is considered 'father of X-ray astronomy'. This finding motivated the creation of UHURU, which was the first orbiting observatory for X-rays. He led the construction of HEAO-2 and participated in the realization of Chandra telescope. His work aided the European developments of this field, including ESA's EXOSAT and XMM-Newton, and the Germany-led ROSAT. Military Innovations= Strategies, methods and operations  *Air supremacy theorized in 1921 by general Giulio Douhet with the book \\"The Command of the Air\\", (\\"Il Dominio dell'Aria\\"). **The first use of airplanes in aerial warfare, airstrike, aerial reconnaissance in an actual war occurred in the 1911 Italo-Turkish War with the Italian Army Air Corps conducting reconnaissance missions by airplane and bombing a Turkish camp at Ain Zara, LibyaU.S. Centennial of Flight Commission:Aviation at the Start of the First World War **The Italian Army became the first army to perform a mass drop of paratroopers, on 6 November 1927, near Milan.Gene Eric Salecker, Blossoming Silk Against the Rising Sun: U.S. and Japanese Paratroopers at War in the Pacific in World War II (Stackpole Books, 2010) p xi *Fabian strategy, a delaying strategy (similar to guerrilla-warfare) first implemented by Quintus Fabius Maximus \\"Cunctator\\" in 217 BC.Goldsworthy, Adrian. The Fall of Carthage. p. 151. . * Italian fencing style: towards the end of '500, the Italian style, putting an emphasis on skills and speed instead of force, spread across Europe, with fencing being instituted as an art. Italians used a lighter weapon, the rapier, finely balanced and fabulous for attack, together with a style of fencing that was, at the same time, simple, controlled and agile. Italians discovered that using the point of the sword was more effective than relying on its edge. The early English fencing style was substituted by the continental one. *Beretta: founded around 1526 by Bartolomeo Beretta, the Fabbrica d‚ÄôArmi Pietro Beretta is the world's oldest manufacturing company and can be considered the oldest industry; during the Venetian-Turkish war (1570‚Äì73) Beretta produced 300 weapons per-day. According to Marco Morin and Robert Held, well-known experts in military history, in the 16th century the Brescian valley became \\"an envied supplier of weapons on a global scale, which for the unsurpassed quality and strength of its products and above all of its gun barrels beat the great metallurgical centers of the time like Suhl, Augsburg and Nuremberg, in Germany\\": weapons were purchased by different Italian States, France and England. In 1975, Beretta introduced the 9mm Model 92, which met worldwide diffusion as the self loading pistol most adopted by armies and law enforcement. *Innovated artillery firing tables: **Double entry tables for ballistic calculus: during WWI, Mauro Picone applied mathematics to improve artillery precision in mountain warfare, solving the differential calculus needed to adeguate the trajectory (and angle of impact) of the projectiles, not just in terms of (horizontal) distance from the target, but, unlike the previous tables, according to different height too. **Firing tables for aircraft (airplanes, airships and balloons): aeronautical shooting tables were defined following the work of Vito Volterra. He is also behind the subsequent use of helium instead of hydrogen in airships, researching how to mount guns on them, and being the first to fire a gun from an airship.  Troops  *Frogmen: the first modern frogmen were the World War II Italian commando frogmen. *Marine infantry -as modern concept of armed troops for defending ships in combat, repel mutinies, and perform organized military landings- were created in vice-realm of Naples in 1537, by Spain King Carlos I, Compa√±√≠as Viejas del Mar de N√°poles, and subsequently in Republic of Venice, Fanti da mar in 1550. Their heritage is keep by Italian elite troops San Marco Regiment. *Alpini: modern special forces intended for mountain warfare, created in 1872. The first 15 Alpini companies were officially established by Kingdom of Italy on 15 October. The Italian example was soon followed by other countries having mountainous areas and thus France formed the Chasseurs des Alpes, in Germany the Alpenkorps were born, in Austro- Hungarian Empire the Landwehr and the Tyrolean hunters (Kaiserj√§ger); similar troops appeared in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Switzerland and Spain. During WWI the Alps have been the major theater of mountain warfare (also called Alpine warfare). Contributions to Music= Notation and performance  *Modern music notation, theorized by Guido di Arezzo in his work Micrologus de disciplina artis musicae (1026). *Guidonian solmization, assigning each note of the diatonic scale to a Solf√®ge (or sol-fa) syllable. This represents a practical method for teaching sight-singing (singing music from written notation). Guido di Arezzo chose the syllables from the first syllable in each line of the Latin hymn Ut queant laxis (Hymn to John the Baptist): ut (or do), re, mi, fa, sol, la, si (subsequent convention). *Ballet, invented and performed for the first time in Florence during the Italian Renaissance. *Bel canto, a style that reigned supreme in Italian theaters, concert halls, and churches throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.Hilary Poriss, \\"Bel Canto: A Performer‚Äôs Guide\\" by Robert Toft Performance Practice Review Vol. 18: No. 1, Article 5.http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1281&context;=ppr50x50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. *Cantata, (from Italian cantare, sing), originally designating a musical composition meant to be sung as opposed to be instrumentally performed (viz., sonata); now vaguely used for compositions featuring both voices and instruments. The early \\"cantata\\" have been written by Italians, and this word was used for the first time by the Italian composer Alessandro Grandi; there had been precursors (such as strophic arias, and late madrigals of Claudio Monteverdi). *Libretto, grouping opera text; the earliest operas had their words printed in small books (lit. libretto) for commemoration (see also melodramma). *Opera, the earliest (1597) being written by Ottavio Rinuccini, put to music by Jacopo Peri and titled 'Dafne (also see Neapolitan genre Opera Buffa). *Oratorio, large musical composition for orchestra, choir and soloists,Oxford English Dictionary: \\"A large-scale, usually narrative musical work for orchestra and voices, typically on a sacred theme and performed with little or no costume, scenery, or action.\\" usually narrative and sacred in nature; the first surviving being Rappresentazione di anima et di corpo (lit. The Representation of Soul and Body) by Emilio del Cavaliere, characterized by dramatic action and ballet. Later, Giacomo Carissimi's o. verged towards a more sober expression, adopting Old Testament text written in Latin. *Symphony (origins): symphonies are written, usually orchestral, instrumental compositions. Their starting point can be located in Lombardy around 1730; in specific, they are to be found in Alessandro Scarlatti's opera overtures, showing a fast-slow-fast structure (Allegro-Adagio-Allegro) that later spread throughout Europe. A second type of symphony, bipartite slow-fast, emerged from the compositions of Italian-French Giovanni Battista Lulli. However, the etymology of the word is œÉœÖŒºœÜœâŒΩŒØŒ± (\\"agreement or concord of sound\\"), and the concept existed at least since the mid-16th century. Early orchestral compositions have been written by Giovanni Gabrieli, with the vivid Italian style being prosecuted by his pupil Heinrich Sch√ºtz. Giovanni Battista Sammartini transformed the opera overtures in concerts of their own (e.g Memet, 1732). Joseph Haydn inserted a fourth movement (in the form of \\"Minuet dance\\") in the structure of A. Scarlatti.  Contemporary Styles  *Italo dance a style of music popular in the 1970-1980s *Italo disco a style of music popular in the 1980s *Italo house a style of music popular in the late 1980s  Contributions to Sport  *Bocce, a boules-type game dating back to Roman times and later developed in Italy; bocce volo as a variant. The game was spread across Europe by the Romans and is closely related to the later British bowls and French boules. *Calcio Fiorentino or historic football. The Vocabolario della Crusca (first edited in 1612) noted: \\"Calcio [lit. soccer, football, kick] is also the name of an ancient and proper game of the city of Florence, like an orderly battle, with a ball, resembling the spheromachy, passed from Greeks to Latins and from Latins to us\\". The noble Piero de 'Medici summoned the most skilled players to his court, thus representing the first patronage applied to football. In the Great Britain of the 19th century, soccer evolved into modern regulation. * Cassina Movements 1 and 2, in artistic gymnastics horizontal bar competition, are a couple of movements consisting in a giant Kovacs straight with 1/1 turn (also known as a K√µlman in the straight position), created and performed for the first time by gymnast and Olympic Games Gold Medalist Igor Cassina and named after him by the International Gymnastics Federation in 2002. *Sicilian Defence: in the game of Chess, an opening move created in Italy around the 16th century and described for the first time in a Chess theory book of 1594 by Chess Master Giulio Cesare Polerio. *Gran Fondo: in road cycling, type of long-distance ride dating back to the first Gran Fondo from Milan to Turin in 1894, and roughly translates into English as \\"Big Ride\\". Italian Gran Fondos are officially defined and certified by the Italian Cycling Federation as a bicycle event at least long, and are individually chip-timed (start to finish) races with prizes for the fastest riders in each category. *Five-pins billiard game and Goriziana pin billiard game. *Italian Circuit Tournament, a system of matching adopted at first in Italian football tournament cups, is a particular formula of competitions with more than two participants, which involves not only the holding of direct matches between all the participant teams in all possible combinations, but also a second series of matches or second round. The first direct match is played at the home stadium of one of the two teams, and the second direct match is performed at the stadium of the other team, in order to minimize the advantage for the home team to play on well known grounds, with incitement of local supporters. A competition of this type can also be called an Italian tournament, opposed to American or knockout tournaments common in Tennis and other sports. The formula, common especially in team sports, refers to the concept of a double round-robin tournament. *Italian playing cards and related games, such as Scopa, Scopone scientifico, Tressette, Asso pigliatutto, Briscola. *Palio: initially used to indicate speed competitions, usually with horses, it later embraced many other peculiarities, evolving into a group of typical manifestations dating back to various Italian medieval cities.  Geographical Discoveries  The following is an extract of the most noteworthy geographical discoveries, partially or totally Italian: *Americas: America as a continent has been explored and inhabited by American natives (since 17,000 years ago)Wells, Spencer; Read, Mark (2002). The Journey of Man - A Genetic Odyssey (Digitised online by Google books) and the Vikings (with even conjectures of Roman presence); Cristoforo Colombo is credited for introducing the 'New World' to the major European powers and, by extension, to Western Europe. The year of his discovery (1492 AD) symbolically marks the starting point of western colonialism and the modern age of history. Later, the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci came to the conclusion that the land (discovered by Colombo) was a new continent, which has been named after him.See Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online \\"Amerigo Vespucci\\" and Room, Adrian (2004), Placenames of the world: origins and meanings of the names for over 5000 natural features, countries, capitals, territories, cities and historic sights; the Americas are believed to have derived their name from the feminized Latin version of his first name. * North America's Atlantic coast: **Giovanni Caboto was the first European to explore the coast since the Vikings; he discovered Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island. **Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to discover New York Bay and Narragansett Bay, exploring the coast between Florida and New Brunswick.Greene, George Washington (1837).

The Terror of the Snake Woman) is a low budget black- and-white 1961 British horror film produced by George Fowler and directed by Sidney J. Furie. It stars Susan Travers and John McCarthy. The film was shown on a double bill in the UK with several movies, including re-releases of The Split (a.k.a. The Manster) (1959) and The Vikings (1958), and as the second feature on a double bill with Doctor Blood's Coffin (1961) in the US. The film is set in a small English village at the turn of the 20th century. It tells the story of Atheris (Susan Travers), a young woman who has the power to transform from human to cobra, and the Scotland Yard detective (John McCarthy) sent to investigate a series of deaths, unusual because all the victims died after being bitten by snakes that are not native to the UK. Plot In the tiny Northumbrian village of Bellingham in 1890, herpetologist Dr. Horace Adderson (John Cazabon) has successfully been keeping his wife Martha's (Dorothy Frere) unnamed mental illness under control by regularly injecting her with snake venom. When Martha dies giving birth to their daughter, local midwife Addie Harker (Elsie Wagstaff), who villagers believe is a witch, proclaims that the baby - who doesn't blink and is cold to the touch - is pure evil, the 'devil's offspring' and must be destroyed. She is stopped before she can stab the new-born with scissors. But she runs to the local pub and an angry mob follow her to Adderson's laboratory and set it and his house ablaze. Just before they arrive, Dr. Murton (Arnold Marl√©), who delivered the baby, saves her by giving her to a sympathetic local shepherd (Stevenson Lang) to watch her for the night. Murton doesn't know that Adderson was killed by a snakebite as his lab burned and believes that Adderson will return for the child in the morning. Murton then leaves Bellingham for an extended period of research in Africa. Nineteen years later, Murton returns and learns that several corpses have been discovered on the moors, each containing lethal amounts of king cobra venom. Encouraged by Addie, the fearful villagers believe that the Curse of the Snake Woman is upon them. Col Clyde Wynborn (Geoffrey Denton), who has retired to the village, phones an old army colleague (Hugh Moxey), now an Inspector at Scotland Yard, to report the strange events. The Inspector despatches Charles Prentice (John McCarthy), but the young detective is sceptical of the supernatural aspects of the case as he begins his investigation. Charles soon encounters a beautiful, though unblinking and cold to the touch, young woman named Atheris (Susan Travers), She was the baby born of the Addersons and raised by the shepherd until she mysteriously disappeared. Atheris is attracted to Charles by the tune he's tootling on a snake-charmer's flute that Wynborn has given him. After discussing the case with Wynborn and again seeing Atheris, Charles goes to Addie's house, where she pins a voodoo doll to the wall and tells Charles to shoot it three times. When he does, Aggie tells him that the Curse of the Snake Woman has now been broken - but that he, Charles, must shoot Atheris three times and kill her. Charles doesn't believe any of what he's learned and decides to return to London. He stops at the Bellingham pub to write his report and Polly the barmaid (Frances Bennett) convinces him that the curse is indeed true. Charles then heads off to find Atheris. When he discovers the full-body skin that she's shed, as a snake would, and Aggie explains what it is, he too believes that Atheris is the snake woman. In the meantime, a village boy has died from a snakebite. Murton believes that Atheris has murdered the boy and sets out to destroy her. But when he aims his shotgun at her, Atheris kills him. The boy's father, distraught over his son's death and quite drunk, also goes to the moors to find Atheris. She kills him, as well. After finding Murton's body, Charles catches up Atheris and tells her that he understands that she can't help being what she is and that he'll make sure that she comes to no harm. But she instinctively transforms into a cobra, and after menacing Charles, he is forced to shoot her three times, just as Aggie had predicted. Upon returning to Scotland Yard, Charles submits his report to the Inspector, who promptly destroys it - not because he fears that it might not be believed, but because it might.

Hampton, was purchased by Furie's Caralan Productions Ltd. Furie himself rewrote it to be set in England at the turn of the 20th century in order to 'cash in on the current fad for period pieces' that characterised the popular horror films of Hammer Film Productions. The Snake Woman was 'intended only as the lower half of a double bill' and its 'perfunctory re-write' left it looking as if it was made 'with the sole intention of making the A feature look better'.John Hamilton, The British Independent Horror Film 1951-70 Hemlock Books 2013 p 115-118 The movie had a budget of ¬£17,000 and was shot in six days at Walton Studios in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England. The rapid production was possible, according to Furie, because 'all the sets were built inside each other. You peeled one off, you had the next set. And you peeled that one off, you had the next. It was like working in television again'. Although British film critic John Hamilton writes in The British Independent Horror Film 1951-1970 that the film was given an X-certificate by the British Board of Film Censors, the BBFC's modern equivalent, the British Board of Film Classification, states that The Snake Woman was granted an A-certificate on 3 November 1960 after unspecified cuts were made to the film. The X-cert would have restricted exhibition to those over age 16, while the A-cert meant that the film 'was more suitable for adults' but had no specific age restrictions.  Distribution  Upon release, The Snake Woman was distributed to theatres in both the UK and the US by United Artists. The film premiered in the US on 26 April 1961 in Los Angeles. One source says that the UK release date was in May 1961 while another indicates that it was released in the UK sometime in 1962. It was shown in West Germany in May 1961 and in Finland, Austria and Italy at unspecified dates. The movie was re-released theatrically in Australia in 1997. United Artists placed The Snake Woman in theatres as a second feature. Hamilton writes that in the UK, the film was 'briefly associated with the foreign curiosity The Split [a.k.a. The Manster] (1959), and over the next few years, it was hauled off the shelf to make up various double-bills, including a re-release of UA's The Vikings (1958)'. In the US, BoxOffice magazine noted that UA 'is coupling the film with another Fowler film, \\"Dr. Blood's Coffin,\\" which has the advantage of colour and three British players who will be familiar to devotees of English fare'. The film has been distributed repeatedly for home viewing in the US. It was available on VHS from Cinemacabre at an unspecified date and on DVD by Timeless Media in 2013. Also in 2013, Shout Factory distributed it as part of the Movies 4 You: Timeless Horror DVD set, which also includes The Face of Marble (1946), I Bury the Living (1958) and The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake (1959). Then, on 7 June 2016, Mill Creek Entertainment simultaneously released The Snake Woman in three multi-film DVD packages - Killer Creature Features: 50 Movie Pack; Strange Predators: 20 Movie Collection; and Monsters Attack!: 25 Movie Collection. Critical reception The Snake Woman was not well-liked by film critics upon its release. American film historian Bill Warren quotes the reviewer 'Tube' in Variety as calling the film a 'second-rate supporting number for a horror package' and noting that 'At times the interpretation hovers about a step away from lapsing into a parody of itself, which might have been a more sensible concept to begin with'. Likewise, Hamilton quotes contemporary reviews. Daily Cinema called the movie 'ripe horror hokum with a few well-contrived thrills [but] more likely to get unintentional laughs than chill spines' while Films and Filming suggested, along the same lines, that 'The producers' best hope is to offer ¬£10,000 to the first spectator to die laughing'. And the Monthly Film Bulletin reported that given the film's setting in the 1890s, the 'direction, acting and script are all so painfully inept and primitive that the film might well date from the same period'. Video Confidential wrote that 'obviously hoping to ride the wave of success that Hammer studios were enjoying, this black-and-white programmer blatantly misses all the cues that would insure even the slightest spark of box office fire. The script is clumsy, overly-talkative and there is practically no action to alleviate the plodding pace'. After earlier calling the film 'A thoroughly routine horror drama [that] will barely get by as the lower half of an exploitation bill', BoxOffice, in its 28 August 1961 issue, briefly summarised its rankings by several publications. The New York Daily News, The Hollywood Reporter, Film Daily, Harrison's Reports and BoxOffice itself all rated the movie as 'fair' while Parents' Magazine and Variety called it 'poor'. Later reviewers were no more impressed with The Snake Woman than were the earlier ones. British critic Phil Hardy calls it 'an inept shocker' that 'fails in all departments'. Warren says that the film is 'about as slight a story as has been filmed by anyone approaching competent film-making, and fully deserves the almost total obscurity into which it has fallen'. And Hamilton points out that 'Production values were rock-bottom, the black-and-white photography was functional at best, and even the revised script was barely able to sustain interest for more than a fraction of its already-truncated running time of 68 minutes'. On the other hand, Drewe Shimon describes the film in Britmovie as 'neither underrated nor a classic. What it is is a competent enough B-movie programmer, entertaining in its own way and enjoyable enough to fit into the \\"cosy horror\\" subgenre'.

The ladies go to a women's equality seminar where the speaker, Dr. Van Dyke (Molly Shannon), preaches that women should dominate the relationship and be completely equal to their \\"lesser halves.\\" The wives enter a strip club, one where men dance. Monte goes to retrieve them, where he ends up in the show. After returning to Utah, the ladies take a more dominant role in the house and become less dependent. At the digging site for his new ski resort, Monte's crew discovers human bones and believes they have uncovered an ancient Native American burial ground. Gates has a scheme to frame Monte for a counterfeit money operation. Monte goes to jail, and assistant Ray confirms they have indeed been building on an ancient burial site. At a town trial, Gates argues that Monte should be excommunicated. His wives and his lawyer/waiter Paul attest that Monte is a good man, but he is found guilty regardless. Tony and his right hand man Shuffles come into town, and inform Gates that they have been sent by crime boss Don Giovanni, to assassinate Monte. Gates gloats that he is of Native American descent, making him the rightful owner of the land, enabling him to turn the town into a gambling resort. Monte's wives drive a truck into the jail and break him out. Monte races to the dig site where the police show up and Gates' plan is revealed. The police arrest Gates and Monte is free to go, but Don Giovanni appears. All seems lost until Don Giovanni (Jerry Stiller) recognizes Monte as his old childhood friend, whom Monte had built his first house. Don Giovanni yells at his hoods, for not telling him that it was Monte looking to build the ski resort; otherwise he would have left his good friend alone. Alone with his five wives, Monte asks that they make a decision about their future... leading to him getting thrown out. Monte leaves Utah, but finds happiness with his ninth and current wife, Dr. Van Dyke, who commends him for being the \\"sensitive man\\" she always sought.

It was released on 28 May 2010, as the third single from their 2009 album Liebe ist f√ºr alle da. Just before announcing the premiere of the song's video, Rammstein's website left this quote regarding the song: \\"the shark not only has teeth ‚Äì he's got tears as well. But since it lives in the briny deep, no one sees them. A shame. After all, this cartilaginous fish is one of the oldest of the world's many misunderstood creatures. A bit more sympathy couldn't hurt!\\" The chorus to the song is an allusion to the lyrics of \\"Mack the Knife\\", a song written by Berthold Brecht for his play The Threepenny Opera. \\"Haifisch\\" reached number 33 on the German singles chart, but left the chart the following week. Music video The music video was released on 23 April 2010 on the band's Myspace page. It shows the band at the funeral of the lead singer, Till Lindemann, with some other mourners, one of whom is Marilyn Manson. A fight breaks out between two women who have had Till's children. Meanwhile, the rest of the band contemplate who should replace Lindemann as the singer (Henry Rollins and James Hetfield are suggested, with Hetfield presumably being picked, as his picture was shown more than once, as well as being pointed to by one of the band members). As the video continues, Lindemann's coffin is lowered into the grave below the inscription \\"endlich allein\\" (German: \\"finally alone\\") and many scenarios are shown of how Lindemann died, which are all based on previous Rammstein videos: being beaten and set on fire by Christoph Schneider (\\"Du hast\\"), having his rope cut while rock climbing by Richard Kruspe (\\"Ohne dich\\"), having his oxygen pipe removed from his space suit by Oliver Riedel while on the moon (\\"Amerika\\"), and a fat Lindemann being suffocated with spaghetti force-fed to him by Christian Lorenz (\\"Keine Lust\\" and \\"Seven (1995 film)\\"). Lorenz also imagines Paul Landers being spanked by Lindemann in a Snow White costume (\\"Sonne\\"). There is a reference to the \\"Ich will\\" video as Landers opens the French doors to confront Kruspe. Later in the video, the band begins to fight amongst themselves and Lorenz finds himself falling into the grave and breaking open Lindemann's coffin, revealing that there is no body inside. Lindemann, having grown a mustache, is then shown alive and well in Oahu, Hawaii, where he sends a postcard to the band that reads \\"Viele Gr√º√üe vom Arsch der Welt\\" (German: \\"Greetings from the ass (arse) of the world\\") and shows that he has caught a tiger shark on what appears to be February 14, 2010, being a prelude leading into the \\"Mein Land\\" video. In two close-ups of writing on Lindemann's coffin, lyrics from other Rammstein songs, Nebel, Seemann and Ohne dich are seen: *\\"Ich werde in die Tannen gehen.\\" from Ohne dich; *\\"Am Ende bleib ich doch alleine.\\" from Seemann; *\\"Seine Worte frisst der Wind\\" from Nebel. It was the first Rammstein video from Liebe ist f√ºr alle da not to be premiered on the adult site Visit-X. Live performances \\"Haifisch\\" made its live debut, as most of Rammstein's songs, during fan exclusive concerts held in Berlin in October 2009, segueing out of Sonne and followed by \\"Ich will\\", separating the common duo that has been a feature in the encores since 2001. When played live, the break is extended and a band member (usually Flake, who hadn't performed the stunt in years) surfs the crowd in a rubber dinghy - a feat that previously had been performed during \\"Stripped\\", \\"Seemann\\" and, occasionally, \\"Heirate mich\\". The band member will then proceed to wave a flag of the country that the show is being performed in. Due to this boat ride, the song may reach the 10 minutes mark, almost three times the length of the studio version. This stunt is now performed in \\"Ausl√§nder\\" instead of Haifisch.

The 'Plein Jeu' is a mixture stop voiced fairly boldly where a powerful effect is needed, particularly when added to the Great Diapason Chorus. A typical IV rank might be 19 22 26 29 in the bass. Many organ builders use the name Plein-jeu for a compound ranks stop. When a single key on the organ is pressed, four or more notes sound, each at octave and fifth relationships to each other. Three ranks of pipes sound three notes, and two ranks sound two notes, and so forth. As the stop progresses upward on the keyboard, the notes \\"break\\" back to the next lower octave or fifth. This stop is used to add depth, clarity, and definition and power to an entire organ compass, or just an ensemble of stops.

The modern dock was constructed in 1842 and the area was a hive of industry up until the 1970s, at the time of completion, the dock was known as 'the biggest and most important enclosed dock in the kingdom'. Although the dock as it stands was constructed in 1842, the area was used for trade as far back as the 7th century. The decline of industry in the town resulted in the area being transformed into a trendy area of Ipswich, the waterfront is now characterised by its marina, known as Neptune Marina, as well as its mix of classical and postmodern architecture which includes multiple high-rise apartment buildings, restaurants, bars and caf√©s. The waterfront is also home to the main campus of the regions university, the University of Suffolk. Early period The Wet Dock, Ipswich oil painting by Claude Lorraine Nursey c. 1842 alt=alt=A dock was in operation in Ipswich on a bend in the River Orwell in the 8th century, and was probably established during the 7th century under the protection of the ruling house of the Kingdom of East Anglia, which reached its summit under King Raedwald. The importance of this dock, and the surrounding town which served it, has been recognised through excavation over the past fifty years. The early town of Ipswich (then called Gipeswic), centred upon the quay, extended over more than 52 hectares, the area later enclosed by the Viking Age ramparts (which curtailed the Anglo-Saxon township), making it one of the largest new early post-Roman townships and emporia in northern Europe.K. Wade, 'Gipeswic - East Anglia's first economic capital, 600-1066', in N. Salmon and R. Malster (eds), Ipswich From The First To The Third Millennium (Ipswich, 2001), 1-6. Imported pottery of Rhenish Merovingian types, imported lava quern-stones and barrel-timbers dendro-dated to 8th century Germany, and finds of continental coinage such as 'porcupine sceattas' indicate trade through the Rhine port towns including Domburg, Dorestad and Andernach, as part of the cultural engagement of Anglo-Saxon England with the Frisian, Frankish, Alamannic, Saxon, Thuringian and Burgundian worlds.R. Hodges, Dark Age Economics: The Origins of Town and Trade AD 600-1000 (London 1982): R. Hodges, The Anglo-Saxon Achievement (London 1988). The important 'Ipswich Ware' pottery industry, established in the town's north-east quarter probably in the late 7th century, reflected shapes and kiln technologies based on Frisian prototypes, either in imitation of imports arriving at the quay or set up by migrant Frisian workers.N. Scarfe, The Suffolk Landscape (New Edition, Phillimore, Chichester 2002), p. 71-72. Wade (cited above). The Gipeswic dock was therefore the trade capital of the East Anglian Kingdom, situated not far from its royal centre at Rendlesham and Sutton Hoo. During the 7th and 8th centuries the two greatest English ports were York (Eoforwic) and London, and two principal new ports were Gipeswic in the east and Hamwic (Southampton) in the south. Like Hamwih, Gipeswic dock was therefore a point of departure and arrival for continental travel.S. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times (Tempus, Stroud 2005), 76-78, 129-133. . The early waterfront of Ipswich Dock ran from approximately St Peter's Church, near the present Stoke Bridge, eastward behind the present quay or marina embankment and past the present Custom House. It lay originally nearer to the line of College Street and Salthouse Street, with new revetments being built successively further out into the river in order to achieve a sufficient depth of water for ships to moor, as the earlier embankments became silted. The area between the road and the quay, formerly occupied by warehouses and now by new building developments, represents this area of successive embankments built upon river- mud. An extensive area of early Medieval waterfront construction was found by excavationFor illustrations of the Anglo-Saxon revetments under excavation, see J. Fairclough, Boudica to Raedwald: East Anglia's Relations with Rome (Malthouse Press, Ipswich 2010), pp. 238-39, colour plates. . during recent works to demolish the old industrial waterfront, and showed the footings of many projecting boardwalks,Plunkett (cited above), 130. See Rhodri Gardner, 'Ipswich, Cranfield's Mill', in 'Archaeology in Suffolk 2005', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History 41 Part 2, 2006, p.251. in a similar way to the contemporary waterfront at Dorestad, one of its principal trading partners in those times.A. E. Verhulst, The Rise of Cities in North- Western Europe (Cambridge University Press 1999), pp. 27-30. The original crossing was a ford, east of Stoke Bridge, linking Great Whip Street (on the south bank) with Foundation Street to the north, which then immediately branched into Lower Brook Street. The area north of the road, between St Peter's church and St Mary-at-Quay (and east of that), is thought to represent the site of the Anglo-Saxon industrial waterfront development. Its first urban catchment area extended north up to Falcon Street, Old Cattle Market, Dog's Head Street and Tacket Street, with burial grounds on rising land to the north.R. Malster, A History of Ipswich (Phillimore, Chichester 2000), pp. 5-10. Cemeteries, see C. Scull, Early medieval (late 5th-early 8th centuries AD) Cemeteries at Boss Hall and Buttermarket, Ipswich, Suffolk: The Society for Medieval Archaeology, Monograph 27 (Leeds: The Society for Medieval Archaeology 2009). . Probably during the 8th century the Stoke Bridge crossing was created, establishing the importance of St Peter's Street as the main northern route, and urban expansion spread over the burial grounds north to include the street called Buttermarket, the Cornhill area, and the line of the prehistoric road now represented by Westgate Street, Tavern Street and Carr Street.Wade (cited above). Discoveries of early sceattas in this area, and a dedication to St Mildred, suggest that this new layout was planned during the reigns of Kings Ealdwulf (664-713) and his son AElfwald (713-749).Scarfe 2002 (cited above), 72-74. The street plan represented by this early Medieval development still largely survives in use in the modern town of Ipswich, and is one of the oldest post-Roman street-plans to survive anywhere in Europe. Both dock and town have remained in continuous use and occupation since that time.Malster 2000, Wade 2001, Plunkett 2005 (cited above). In 991 a fleet of 93 Viking ships swept up the river Orwell and sacked the town. During Edward III's reign Ipswich was one of the richest and most important ports in the country. Wool from Norfolk and Suffolk was in great demand by the weavers of Flanders and the Netherlands. 300 ships massed in the river to carry soldiers to fight and win the battle of Cressy. In 1588 Ipswich built, fitted out and manned two ships to sail against the Spanish Armada. 1700-1950 Neptune Quay c. 1890 John Kirby reported in 1732 that the trade in the town had recently reduced and that there had been 20 ships a year built in the town and having seen over 200 ships belonging to the town in the port during the winter.Twinch (2009), page 80The Old Customs House on the WaterfrontIsaacs on the Quay, a former malt kiln transformed into the largest pub in Ipswich. Adjacent to Isaacs is the Salthouse Harbour HotelThe dock was 'improved' in 1805 and then in 1837 an Act of Parliament allowed the Ipswich Dock Commissioners to construct a new wet dock whilst also placing certain conditions on them. Edward Caley was chief engineer, at the age of 20.http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/new-quayside-window-museum-display- features-the-waterfront-of-yesterday-and- today-1-4066142https://www.suffolkarchives.co.uk/places/ipswich-quay/ In addition to building the wet dock and providing a diversion for the river Orwell along a 'New Cut' to the west of the dock the commissioners were to allow all persons, with cattle and carriages, may thereby have free access to the dock and quays and the sides of the said new cut and channel and also to contribute to the health and recreation of the inhabitants [of Ipswich]. The Ipswich Dock Commission was provided with investment of ¬£25,000 and the right to borrow a further ¬£100,000 but needed a further loan of ¬£20,000 and also an additional levy of six pence per tonne on all imported coal to fund the project.Twinch (2009), page 94 The dock opened in 1842; the original lock gates entered the dock from the New Cut opposite Felaw Street. The new custom house (now known as the 'Old Custom House') was completed in 1845. The Ipswich Docks Act of 1877 allowed for the construction of a new lock in their present position to facilitate access to the dock and allow trams to operate along the length of the 'Island' between New Cut and the dock. The new lock gates were constructed by the time of the 1898 Act which authorised the construction of a swing bridge. Ipswich Docks Act of 1913 allowed for the construction of a new entrance to the docks comprising inner and outer gates and a swing bridge, a quay and various tramways and also allowed for the 'stopping off' of various rights of way. There was however a condition that work had to be completed within 10 years and following World War I an extension was granted by an Act of Parliament in 1918. 1950-present day alt= The Ipswich Dock Act 1971 authorised the development of the West Bank to allow ro-ro ships to dock. The Ipswich Dock Commission was reconstituted as the Ipswich Port Authority in 1973Suffolk County Council (2009a), para 73 when the first stage of the development was completed, further work was carried out in 1977 and 1979 and then again in 1998. In 1997 the port was sold by Ipswich Ports Ltd to Associated British Ports. In 1998 new facilities were constructed for handling grain and timber followed by a Timber Treatment Centre in 1999. A new 7,500 square metre bulk storage shed with equipment for bagging and blending of fertilizers and other bulk products was then developed in the site of Cliff Quay Power Station. In 2000 there were a number of further developments; a ¬£1.9million agribulk storage facility opened; new automated lock gates were completed; a 180 berth Ipswich Haven Marina opened and the Old Custom House was refurbished and restored with the former bonded warehouse on the ground floor converted into the 'Waterfront Conference Centre'. In 2009 Tarmac Ltd invested around ¬£8 million into a new development on the Powerstation Quay, the new site incorporated a state of the art asphalt plant and concrete plant. The new site imports a significant amount of aggregate from Northern Ireland and Europe and operates 24/7.  The Waterfront  Facing west on the Ipswich Waterfront The Waterfront in Ipswich is now provides leisure facilities with many new buildings having been constructed along the northern and eastern quays since 1995. The Salthouse Harbour Hotel, opened in 2003 and was extended in 2009. The University of Suffolk opened on the waterfront in 2008 with further construction in progress in 2010. The Mill, a 23-story mixed-use high rise that currently holds the record as East Anglia's tallest building, was topped out in late 2008 by the town's member of parliament, Chris Mole. In 2009, Dance East opened their new ¬£8.9m Jerwood DanceHouse within the building. National Cycle Route 1 and National Cycle Route 51 pass along the waterfront. Ipswich Waterfront Action (previously known as the Ipswich Waterfront Community Group) has been working for a friendly, thriving and vibrant community on the Ipswich Waterfront since 2007. The Port of Ipswich The dock is owned by Associated British Ports who operate both the 'West Bank' terminal (to the west of the New Cut) and 'Cliff Quay' (to the east of the Orwell). West Bank has two transit sheds totaling 6,377 sq m, plus areas available for open storage and operates a ro-ro service. Cliff Quay handles and stores liquid and dry bulks and has 67,583 sq m of covered storage and additional open storage. There is a daily freight ferry service linking Ipswich with the Port of Rotterdam. The container terminal is equipped to handle all types of containers and can also accept out-of-gauge and heavy lift cargoes and is equipped to accommodate short to mid-sea operations. There is also the Ipswich Haven Marina with mooring for 250 private boats, a chandler and two boatbuilders (Fairline Yachts and Spirit Yachts). Welfare and practical services for seafarers arriving at the port are available via the services of a port chaplain. Duke Street Junction Improvements Work has been completed following Suffolk County Council's proposed plans to reduce congestion in the Duke Street-Fore Hamlet area, this was achieved through work on the junctions and rights of way along the route. The scheme was funded through the Community Infrastructure Fund, as it improves connections to and from the redeveloped waterfront area. The scheme included replacing the Duke Street roundabout with a signalled junction with changes to the access onto/off of Back Hamlet and Duke Street, the changes to access resulted in no entry from Back Hamlet to Fore Street and Fore Hamlet meaning that traffic flows more smoothly as there are no interruptions in flow caused by vehicles entering from Back Hamlet; the other change to access is from Duke Street which now has no right turns from Duke Street onto Fore Hamlet. The pedestrian crossing facilities in the area have also been modernised including implementing bus priority measures. Cycle lanes have been added, and the pavement widened along Fore Hamlet, with a bus lane being added to Fore Hamlet.  Ipswich Waterfront Action  The Waterfront Action (previously known as the Ipswich Waterfront Community Group) was established in 2007 as a community initiative with the purpose of working towards a friendly, thriving and vibrant community on the Ipswich Waterfront. The organisation was set up by the Ipswich Waterfront Churches. A constitution has been drawn up so that funding can be sought to push the work forward. Waterfront Action has organised several successful events which were held to help develop a relational and vibrant Ipswich Waterfront Community for both residents and visitors.Proposed restricted byways Restricted Byways Suffolk County Council have created legal orders to create a number of restricted byways around the waterfront.  Ipswich Tidal Barrier  The area around the quays was flooded in 2013 during a tidal surge. In February 2019 a flood gate, which protects the 'New Cut' were unveiled. The flood barrier, similar in design to the Thames Barrier, cost ¬£67m.

It was written by Jennifer Celotta and directed by John Krasinski, which marks his television directorial debut. It originally aired in the United States on NBC on February 4, 2010. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael has difficulties accepting the new policies of Sabre and its CEO Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates). Michael goes to David Wallace for advice, but he finds David in a sad unemployed depression. Jim and Pam fail in their interview for a local daycare center. Both Erin and Andy wait for the other to make the next move. Beginning with this episode, Ed Helms is added to the opening credits. Synopsis Sabre has taken over the branches of Dunder Mifflin and Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), the coordinating director for emerging regions from Sabre, is going around greeting the branches. When Gabe arrives, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) has everyone greet him with a standing ovation and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) sing a Scranton-themed version of \\"Party in the U.S.A.\\" by Miley Cyrus and mispronounce \\"Sabre\\" (as sah-bray), per Michael's assumption that that was the correct pronunciation. In a conference room meeting, Gabe shows a video of Florida-based printer sales company Sabre starring Christian Slater and then shares some of the company's new policies, including the use of reusable drink containers, fewer vacation weeks, and site blocking of time-wasting sites like YouTube and Twitter, which is done in the background by IT assistant Nick (Nelson Franklin). Michael is resistant to the changes and requests a meeting with Gabe's superiors. Michael engages in a video chat with Sabre CEO Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) and expresses concerns about the new policies. Bennett replies that those policies came under a mismanaged company and that Michael would have \\"until the end of the day\\" to decide what he wants, and when he resists she says bluntly, \\"I would take until the end of the day if I were you\\". Frustrated, Michael leaves the office to visit former Dunder Mifflin Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) for advice. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) visit the most prestigious daycare center in the area with hopes to impress the director. Jim enters a bathroom and sees the day care director Jerry (Joey Slotnick) on the toilet. Jim and Pam agree not to bring up the incident during the interview, but when the interview goes poorly Pam directly asks Jerry if this has to do with Jim walking in on him. Jerry denies this, and when Pam refuses to let the subject drop, he makes veiled insults and explains that the bathroom door does not lock for the children's safety. Andy and Erin conduct interviews with the film crew, and each admit interest in dating. However, Andy thinks that the \\"ball is in Erin's court\\" since he already did his part with his last spectacular display involving a band drumline, while Erin assumes that Andy will continue to take the active role in their courtship. Andy tries hinting to Erin to ask him out by inquiring about her weekend plans, but Erin assumes he is leading up to ask her out and eagerly tells him she has nothing planned. Andy exits with exasperation. Michael arrives unannounced at David Wallace's home, and finds that he has not shaved nor done anything productive recently. David's son plays the drums in the living room, while David's wife provides hints that David should actually do something outside the house. Michael and David go in the hot tub, where Michael asks him how he should handle the changes at Sabre. David has no advice and instead asks Michael to join him on his proposed business venture \\"Suck It\\", a vacuum that collects children's toys. Michael, realizing what has happened to David, leaves and expresses concerns for David's well-being to the camera crew. Michael returns to the office and proclaims his allegiance to Sabre and its new policies. He proposes a toast with orange juice in the metallic Sabre bottles to the new management, which after drinking claims it's like drinking a battery. The episode closes with a vignette of David Wallace and his son playing a jingle for the \\"Suck It\\" toy vacuum. Reception This episode was watched by 7.36 million viewers, with a 3.8 rating and a 10 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic rising 3% from the last original episode helping it come in second in its timeslot and the most viewed episode of Comedy Night Done Right.http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/02/05/tv-ratings-abc-edges-cbs-fox- mentalist-community-parks-office-30-rock-vampire-diaries-rise/41146 The episode got mostly positive reviews from critics. Dan Phillips of IGN gave the episode an 8.5, saying it was \\"Great\\" and that \\"The episode isn't the funniest of the season, but it is fun to see the show gear up for its next extended story arc. Whether or not the writers are really implying that we're all a little like Michael, it's clear they're once again casting him as the goofy hero, one who will help resist these new stuffy bosses in his uniquely funny ways.

Federal judicial service  On October 29, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Conley to serve on the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin to fill the vacancy created by Judge Barbara Brandriff Crabb's announcement in March 2009 that she would take senior status.Presidential nominations & withdrawal sent to the Senate, 10/29/09, whitehouse.gov (October 29, 2009).Associated Press, Federal judge in Madison announces retirement, (March 19, 2009). On December 10, 2009 the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary forwarded his nomination to the full United States Senate. Conley was unanimously confirmed, 99-0 on March 4, 2010. He received his commission on March 25, 2010. He served as Chief Judge from March 25, 2010 to April 26, 2017.  Notable cases  On March 10, 2017, Conley granted a request blocking President Donald Trump's administration from enforcing its newly revised travel ban against a Syrian family from the city of Aleppo, saying that daily threats against the man's wife and child could cause \\"irreparable harm\\". The ruling was the first of its kind since the roll out of the second executive order. A federal lawsuit had originally been filed in February against the first travel ban but was set aside by Conley after the ban was blocked. A new complaint filed after the issuance of the second order maintained the revised ban still infringed upon the man's freedom of religion and right to due process. On April 2, 2020, Conley declined to postpone the 2020 Wisconsin Democratic primary despite arguments that the COVID-19 pandemic created a health risk for in-person voters. He concluded that power lay with Wisconsin's executive and legislative branches, writing ‚ÄúAs much as the court would prefer that the Wisconsin Legislature and Governor consider the public health ahead of any political considerations, that does not appear in the cards. Nor is it appropriate for a federal district court to act as the state‚Äôs chief health official by taking that step for them.\\" On September 21, 2020, Conley extended the deadline for Wisconsin voters to submit an absentee ballot for the 2020 presidential election to six days after election day, as long as the ballot was mailed and postmarked on or before election day. Conley ruled that the COVID-19 pandemic would cause more voters to vote by absentee ballot, causing delays and confusion. Conley immediately stayed his ruling for one week so parties could appeal. ‚ÄúJudge gives Wisconsin voters more time to return absentee ballots,‚Äù by Patrick Marley, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Sept. 21, 2020 ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Judges of the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin Category:People from Rice Lake, Wisconsin Category:United States district court judges appointed by Barack Obama Category:21st-century American judges Category:University of Wisconsin Law School alumni Category:Wisconsin lawyers ","title":"William M.

Based in Alberta, AltaLink is responsible for the maintenance and operation of approximately 12,000 kilometres of transmission lines and 280 substations in Alberta. AltaLink is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Overview AltaLink, L.P. is an Alberta-based utility company that provides electricity transmission services to most of Alberta. On April 30, 2002, AltaLink assumed control of Alberta's largest transmission system previously owned by TransAlta. It owns and operates approximately 12,000 km of transmission lines and approximately 280 substations, which makes up for the bulk of Alberta's high‚Äêvoltage electricity transmission infrastructure. AltaLink also owns and operates the Alberta portion of the interconnection that allows electricity to be exchanged between Alberta and British Columbia. AltaLink has more than 600 employees. Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, the company also has offices in Lethbridge, Red Deer, and Edmonton. On May 1, 2014, AltaLink announced that Berkshire Hathaway Energy had agreed to purchase the company from SNC-Lavalin. The sale was completed December 1, 2014 http://www.altalink.ca/news/news- releases.cfm?releasePage=05012014162641 following approval by the Alberta Utilities Commission. Transmission in Alberta Alberta's electricity market is separated into generation, transmission, and distribution. While the cost of electricity generation is dependent upon market forces, the cost of electricity transmission and distribution in Alberta is regulated by the provincial government. This is a breakdown of the electricity market in Alberta. The planning and operation of Alberta's electric system is done by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO), a non-profit entity independent of any industry affiliations and owns no transmission or market assets. The AESO determines the need for the province, and then directs Transmission Facilities Owners (TFOs) to build the project. Transmission Facilities Owners (TFOs) are regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) and include companies like AltaLink, ATCO Electric, ENMAX POWER in Calgary, and EPCOR in Edmonton. All TFOs must follow AUC regulations in engaging stakeholders, and the projects have to be approved by the AUC. Current projects AltaLink is currently involved in a number of major projects, a couple considered publicly and politically sensitive. * Heartland Transmission Project - approved after intense debate and discussion with delegates of Edmonton and Sherwood Park. This project will be connecting the \\"Heartland\\" industrial complex to the grid with a number of modern high capacity lines. * Western Alberta Transmission Line Reinforcement * Southern Alberta Transmission Line Reinforcement Breaking down an electricity bill AltaLink earns a regulated return on its investment to build, operate and maintain Alberta's power system, as determined by the AUC. AltaLink earns this return by recovering a portion of the transmission charge that is on every ratepayer's electricity bill. This transmission charge represents less than 10 per cent of the average total electricity bill. This is a percentage breakdown of a typical residential electricity bill in Alberta. Corporate governance AltaLink is governed by a Board of Directors. The current directors of the board include David Tuer (Chair), Jim Burke, Don Chynoweth, Gilles Laram√©e, Sue Lee, Paul McCoy, Douglas Mitchell, Q.C., Patricia Nelson, and Robert Turgeon. Community Involvement According to AltaLink's 2011 Report to Communities, through the building and maintenance of AltaLink's transmission facilities, the company expects to create more than 37,000 person-years of employment related to construction and local support services between 2010 and 2015. AltaLink has been a sponsor of Alberta 4-H since 2005. Currently, AltaLink is a Legacy Builder sponsor and is the title sponsor of all the regional, district, and provincial communications and public speaking programs. AltaLink is also a member of the Joint Utility Safety Team (JUST). JUST's mandate is to positively affect change in attitudes and behaviours toward power line safety, to help reduce power line incidents. In partnership with the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee, AltaLink hosted Canada's first Avian Interactions with Power Lines Workshop that took place in Banff, Alberta from August 10 to 12, 2011. The international workshop brought together around 100 representatives from AltaLink and the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee, including government and industry professionals from across North America, to focus on protecting birds from electrical equipment. AltaLink also hosts an annual Farm Safety Day in May in Calgary, an event focused on safety within the agricultural sector.

Originating from a tropical wave that developed off the coast of Hispaniola on October 1, the precursor to Fran slowly developing during the first week of October. By October 4, a surface low formed within the system and convective activity increased. The system was eventually classified as a subtropical depression on October 8 and was upgraded to Subtropical Storm Bravo shortly thereafter. Bravo became increasingly tropical throughout the day as it intensified. Following a reconnaissance mission into the storm on October 10, it was deemed fully tropical and upgraded to a hurricane, at which time it was renamed Fran. Hurricane Fran rapidly tracked towards the northeast in response to an area of low pressure within the westerlies. By October 11, the hurricane attained its peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and its lowest barometric pressure of 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg) after bypassing the Azores islands. Situated over exceedingly cold waters, Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October 12 as it neared the French coastline. Shortly before reaching land, the system was absorbed by a cold front. Throughout its existence, Fran had little effect on land. Meteorological history Hurricane Fran originated from a tropical wave associated with an area of convection north of Hispaniola on October 1. The system tracked westward at but gained little strength and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not anticipate development of the storm. By October 4, the system interacted with a mid-tropospheric trough near the southeast United States, resulting in the formation of a surface low. Tracking eastward, showers and thunderstorms began to develop around the circulation; however, the structure of the system was not fully tropical. On October 7, ships in the vicinity of the low reported decreasing barometric pressures, indicating a strengthening system. Satellites monitoring the system depicted a disorganized storm with mainly subtropical characteristics. Late on October 8, the cyclone had become sufficiently organized to be classified a subtropical depression. Cold air from the remnants of a cold front became entrained within the circulation; however, the cold air gradually warmed. On October 9, winds increased to gale-force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. By October 10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane- force winds roughly 15 mi (25 km) from the center of the storm. Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. Upon becoming tropical, Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands. Additionally, the storm had developed a 35 mi (55 km) wide eye. Steered generally eastward by a deep surface low in the westerlies, Fran accelerated towards the Azores Islands. The storm traveled at a rapid pace of but continued to organize. By October 11, the hurricane began to undergo an extratropical transition as it continued to move unusually fast towards the northeast. Around this time, Fran attained its peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Shortly after bypassing the Azores islands on October 12, the system moved over an area with sea surface temperatures around , well below what is required for tropical cyclone development. Later that day, the central pressure of Fran decreased to 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg), the lowest recorded in relation to the hurricane. Shortly after reaching this intensity, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and quickly merged with a cold front off the coast of France. Preparations and impact Although Fran passed near the Azores as a hurricane, winds on the islands only reached 45 mph (75 km/h) and no damage was recorded. On October 12, a French ship encountered the storm, recording sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and an air pressure of 981 mbar (hPa; 28.97 inHg). Ships near the English and French coastlines recorded winds up to 60 mph (95 km/h) as the extratropical remnants of Fran passed through the region.

He is best known for his association with and accompaniment of Sonny Boy Williamson II. Biography Love was born in Duncan, Mississippi. In 1942, he met Sonny Boy Williamson II in Greenville, Mississippi. They played regularly together at juke joints throughout the Mississippi Delta. Love was influenced by the piano playing of Leroy Carr and was adept at both standard blues and boogie-woogie styling. In 1947 Charley Booker moved to Greenville, where he worked with Love.Harris, S (1981). Blues Who's Who. New York: Da Capo Press. p. 59. Two years later, Oliver Sain also relocated to Greenville to join his stepfather, Love, as the drummer in a band fronted by Williamson. When Williamson recorded for Trumpet Records in March 1951, Love played the piano on the recordings. Trumpet's owner, Lillian McMurray, had Love return the following month and again in July 1951, when he recorded his best-known song, \\"Everybody's Fishing\\", which he wrote. Love played piano and sang, with guitar accompaniment by Elmore James and Joe Willie Wilkins. His backing band was known as the Three Aces. A studio session in December 1951 had Love backed by Little Milton (guitar), T.J. Green (fiddle), and Junior Blackman (drums). In his teenage years, Eddie Shaw played tenor saxophone with both Milton and Love. Under his own name, Love did not return to the studio until March 1953, when he cut \\"Worried Blues\\" and \\"Lonesome World Blues.\\" Despite the friendship between them, Love did not utilise Williamson's playing on any of his own material. In April 1953, Love and Williamson recorded in Houston, Texas, in Love's final recording session. Love played piano on Williamson's albums I Ain't Beggin' Nobody and Clownin' with the World (1953). All of Love's own recordings appeared on the compilation album Greenville Smokin', issued in 2000. After suffering the effects of years of heavy drinking, Love died of bronchopneumonia, in August 1953, at the age of 46. He was interred at the Elmwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

A vector inversion generator (VIG) is an electric pulse compression and voltage multiplication device, allowing shaping a slower, lower voltage pulse to a narrower, higher- voltage one. VIGs are used in military technology, e.g. some directed-energy weapons, as a secondary stage of another pulsed power source, commonly an explosive-driven ferroelectric generator. Construction Discrete component VIGs (pictured) consist of a stack of well-coupled common mode chokes interconnected with a stack of capacitors. The inductors present a high inductance to currents that are in-phase in the two windings, and a far lower inductance when the winding currents are flowing in opposite directions. The capacitors are charged with alternating polarity and when the switch (usually a triggered or free running spark gap in practice) is closed the voltage across every second capacitor rapidly inverts as a half cycle of oscillation at a frequency set by the capacitance resonating with the differential mode inductance of the chokes. At the same time the other capacitors discharge very slowly due to not having a differential current flowing to cancel the reactance. So after a half period, all the capacitors are in series and the voltages add. This arrangement has a conceptual equivalence to the spiral VIG, with the alternating capacitors being equivalent to the capacitance between the windings and the common mode chokes being equivalent to the inductance of a winding. Discrete components allow large lumped capacitors to be used thus storing much more energy, but have difficulty replicating the high voltage multiplication ratios and extremely short rise times of spiral transmission line types. A spiral VIG consists of four alternating conductor-insulator- conductor-insulator sheets, wound into a cylinder, forming a capacitor also acting as a single-ended transmission line, connected to a spark gap switch. The capacitor is charged from a power source, e.g. an EDFEG, then the spark gap fires after its breakdown voltage is reached. The electromagnetic wave created by the electric spark discharge travels along the transmission line, converting electrostatic field to electromagnetic field, then after reflecting from the open end converts back to electrostatic field. A pulse of output amplitude 2nU (where n is the number of turns of the capacitor and U is the initial voltage it was charged to) and a rise time equal to twice the electrical length of the transmission line.http://scholarsmine.mst.edu/post_prints/pdf/physics_09007dcc80588630.pdfhttp://www.boliven.com/patent/US7151330/drawingshttp://shadaly.com/vector_inversion_generator_4507567.html The device acts as a distributed pulse forming network. Ferrites can be attached to the VIG construction to modify its characteristics, typically lowering the resonant frequency and increasing the efficiency.http://www.findthatpatent.com/Apparatus_and_method_for_generating_high_voltages_using_a_voltage,7151330.html Applications VIGs are advantageous due to their simplicity and the very short pulse rise times in range of nanoseconds. Some VIGs can be configured as part of a tuned circuit, acting as oscillators with practical upper limit of about 700 MHz, generating energy that can be radiated from a suitable antenna, allowing construction of very simple explosion-generated electromagnetic pulse generators.http://www.armysbir.com/Technologies/View.aspx?pk=45430111-708f-463e-8fe1-cf1392a6bf99 The use of VIGs includes directed-energy weapons, x-ray pulse power supplies, plasma generators, etc. VIGs are simple enough to be constructed by high- voltage hobbyists.http://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?43795.lasthttp://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?action=printable&fid;=6&tid;=6032 References Category:Electric power conversion Category:Pulsed power ","title":"Vector inversion generator"},{"id":"25829645","text":"Swindon Museum and Art Gallery is located in Swindon, Wiltshire, England, in a listed building on the corner of Bath Road and Victoria Road in Swindon's Old Town.

Kaiser Wilhelm II insisted that the new battlecruisers be able to fight in the line of battle with battleships to counter Germany's numerical inferiority. was the first German battlecruiser, built in 1908‚Äì1910. The Kaiserliche Marine eventually built four more battlecruisers before the start of the First World War to serve with the High Seas Fleet, and another two were completed during the conflict. A further seven were planned, including four of the and three of the ships. Two of the Mackensens‚Äîthe name ship and Graf Spee‚Äîwere launched but never completed, and the other two were in earlier stages of work when they were canceled towards the end of the war. Serious work never began on the three Ersatz Yorck-class ships. Six of the seven battlecruisers completed before or during World War I saw relatively heavy combat, primarily in the North Sea. All of the ships, with the exception of , which had been assigned to the German Mediterranean Division, were assigned to the I Scouting Group under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper. The unit conducted several raids of the English coast between 1914 and 1916, which culminated in the Battle of Jutland during 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916, in which they were expected to draw parts of the British fleet onto the German battleship line. The German flagship was scuttled by her crew, on the way back to port, and the other ships were heavily damaged. For their own part, during the battle Von der Tann sank her counterpart , sank , and and L√ºtzow together destroyed . The five remaining battlecruisers‚ÄîVon der Tann, , Seydlitz, Derfflinger, and ‚Äîwere interned with the bulk of the German fleet at the British naval base at Scapa Flow following the end of the war. The ships were subsequently scuttled by their crews in 1919 to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Allied Powers. Goeben was transferred to the Ottoman Navy at the outbreak of hostilities, and operated against the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the majority of the war. She was heavily damaged by British naval mines near the end of the war, but was repaired and went on to serve the Turkish Navy until the 1950s; she was eventually broken up for scrap in the 1970s. The eventual successor to the Kaiserliche Marine, the Kriegsmarine, considered building three s before the Second World War as part of the Plan Z buildup of the Navy. However, the outbreak of war in 1939 caused the plans to be shelved, and none of these ships were built. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em; max-width: 30em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Main guns  The number and type of the main battery guns - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full combat load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel began to be assembled - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Commissioned  The date the ship was Commissioned } __TOC__  SMS Von der Tann  Von der Tann SMS Von der Tann was the first German battlecruiser, ordered in 1907. She was designed in response to the British s, construction on which had begun the previous year. As the first of a new type, the design process for Von der Tann was highly controversial. Gro√üadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary for the Imperial German Navy, wanted the ship to follow the British pattern of large guns, relatively light armor, and high speed. Kaiser Wilhelm II, along with other senior navy officers instead argued that, owing to Germany's numerical inferiority, the new ships should have armor strong enough to permit their use in the battle line. Von der Tann was present for most of the German fleet operations during World War I, including several raids of the English coast. At the Battle of Jutland, Von der Tann was the last ship in the German battlecruiser squadron. She engaged and, after 15 minutes of firing, Von der Tanns 28 cm (11 in) shells caused a magazine explosion, destroying Indefatigable. At the end of the war, Von der Tann was interned in Scapa Flow and eventually scuttled. She was raised in 1930 and broken up for scrap between 1931‚Äì1934. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center; + Summary of the Von der Tann class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"15%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Main guns ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"25%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40%\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"20%\\"  Fate - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó   style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines, 27.75 knots (51 km/h)  21 March 1908  1 September 1910  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Scuttled at Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919, wreck raised 1930s and scrapped at Rosyth }  Moltke class  Goeben in port Moltke and Goeben, improvements over the preceding Von der Tann, were ordered in 1908 and 1909, respectively. While their design was not as contentious as with the Von der Tann, there were still disagreements between Tirpitz and the General Navy Department over whether the main battery guns should be increased in number or caliber. Tirpitz favored the increase to ten guns, while the Navy Department preferred eight 30.5 cm (12 in) guns. It was eventually decided that ten 28 cm guns would be mounted. In addition to the increased main battery, the two Moltke-class ships were slightly larger and better armored than Von der Tann. Moltke joined Von der Tann in the battlecruiser squadron upon her commissioning, and saw action against the British in the North Sea. The ship also saw significant duty in the Baltic Sea against the Russian navy; in 1915 she was torpedoed during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga, and in 1917, she returned to the Baltic as the flagship of the invasion force that conducted Operation Albion. Moltke was also interned in Scapa Flow at the end of the war and scuttled in 1919. Goeben, on the other hand, was assigned to the Mediterranean, as the flagship of the Mediterranean Division. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Goeben and the light cruiser evaded the British fleet and escaped to Istanbul, where they were transferred to the Ottoman Navy. The ship primarily operated in the Black Sea against the Russians. She attacked British forces outside the Dardanelles in 1918 and struck three mines. The ship continued in Turkish service until 1973 when she was sold for scrapping. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center; + Summary of the Moltke class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"15%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Main guns ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"20%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40%\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"20%\\"  Fate - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   10 √ó   style=\\"text- align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,  7 December 1908  30 August 1911  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Scuttled at Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919, wreck raised 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   10 √ó   style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,  28 August 1909  2 July 1912  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Transferred to the Ottoman Empire on 16 August 1914, scrapped in 1973 }  SMS Seydlitz  Seydlitz steaming to Scapa Flow Seydlitz was an incremental improvement over the Moltke class. The ship was slightly larger than the two previous ships, and had a taller forecastle. Seydlitz mounted the same ten 28 cm guns as in the Moltke class in the same arrangement. Upon commissioning into the fleet, Seydlitz became the flagship of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper. The ship took part in most of the major fleet operations during the war. At the Battle of Dogger Bank, Seydlitz was hit in her after turrets by two or three 34.4 cm (13.5 in) shells from ; the shells burnt out the turrets and nearly destroyed the ship. At Jutland, Seydlitz inflicted fatal damage on the British battlecruiser . The ship was heavily damaged through the remainder of the battle, and took in over 5,300 metric tons (5,200 long tons) of water. Despite the immense damage, Seydlitz was able to make the trip back to Wilhelmshaven, where she was repaired. As with Von der Tann and Moltke, Seydlitz was interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center; + Summary of the Seydlitz class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"15%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Main guns ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"25%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40%\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"20%\\"  Fate - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   10 √ó   style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines, 28.1 knots (51 km/h)  4 February 1911  22 May 1913  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Scuttled at Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919, wreck raised 1928 and scrapped at Rosyth }  Derfflinger class  Hindenburg (center) and Derfflinger (left background) in Scapa Flow The three Derfflinger-class ships were the last battlecruisers completed for the German navy. The ships' primary armament was radically modified compared to the older ships. The number of guns was reduced to eight, but their diameter was increased to 30.5 cm (12 in). They were also placed in two superfiring pairs, fore and aft of the main superstructure. The first unit, the name ship, was completed shortly after the outbreak of World War I. L√ºtzow followed in August 1915, and Hindenburg joined the fleet in May 1917. Derfflinger was involved in most of the fleet actions during the war. At Jutland she fired on Queen Mary and contributed to her destruction, along with Seydlitz. Derfflinger and L√ºtzow later concentrated their fire on and destroyed her. However, during the battle, L√ºtzow was severely damaged by at least 24 heavy-caliber shells and was unable to make it back to Germany. She was scuttled early the following morning. Hindenburgs career was much less eventful; she was completed so late in the war that she saw no significant action against the British fleet. She and Derfflinger were interned and scuttled in Scapa Flow with the rest of the fleet. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center; + Summary of the Derfflinger class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"15%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Main guns ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"25%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40%\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"20%\\"  Fate - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó   style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,  30 March 1912  1 September 1914  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Scuttled in Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919, wreck raised 1939, broken up after 1946 - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó   style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,  May 1912  8 August 1915  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Scuttled after severe damage at the Battle of Jutland, 1 June 1916 - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó   style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,  1 October 1913  10 May 1917  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Scuttled in Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919, wreck raised 1930, scrapped 1930‚Äì1932 }  Mackensen class  Line-drawing of the Macksensen design Following the realization in February 1915 that the war would not be won quickly, the Navy department decided to replace the six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being the adoption of the 35 cm (13.8 in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four ships were ordered and laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center; + Summary of the Mackensen class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"15%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Main guns ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"25%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40%\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"20%\\"  Fate - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó   style=\\"text- align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,  1914  ‚Äî  style=\\"text- align: left;\\"  Struck on 17 November 1919, broken up 1922 - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó   style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,  1915  ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Struck on 17 November 1919, broken up 1921‚Äì1922 - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó   style=\\"text- align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,  1915  ‚Äî  style=\\"text- align: left;\\"  Broken up 1921 - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó   style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,  1915  ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Struck on 17 November 1919, broken up 1922 }  Ersatz Yorck class  Line-drawing of Ersatz Yorck The three ships of the Ersatz Yorck class were originally ordered as Mackensen-class ships, but the design was modified in January 1917 to increase the armament to eight 38 cm (15 in) guns. The Ersatz Yorcks were otherwise similar to the Mackensens, with the exception of the funnels. The Ersatz Yorck-class ships were modified to trunk the two smoke uptakes of the previous design into one large funnel. Only the lead ship was laid down, and work did not proceed far; only about 1,000 metric tons of steel had been assembled by the time work ceased.

The three ships were armed with six 38 cm guns in three twin turrets, similar to the arrangement of the main battery of the s. They were intended for use as long-range commerce raiders, with the goal of forcing Great Britain to disperse its battleships as convoy escorts.

The squadron operates the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper. The 33rd SOS was named Air Force Special Operations Command‚Äôs Special Operations Squadron of the Year for 2012. The squadron was reactivated by the Air Force in May 2009 in direct response to combat needs of today's overseas contingency operations. Overview The mission of the 33rd SOS is to operate the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, primarily over combat areas to provide Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR). During 2012, 39 members of the squadron were deployed, accumulating a total of 3,891 days downrange and facilitating thousands of hours of ISR coverage. Ten additional squadron members were deployed to fill roles such as Remotely Piloted Aircraft liaison officers, ISR battle captains, and group commanders. Their deployed contributions totaled 517 days. The 33rd SOS is one of the oldest squadrons in the Air Force, its origins dating to 12 June 1917. Over this time, members of the squadron took part in World War I, World War II, the 1991 Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. History=World War I The 33rd Special Operations Squadron traces its history to the organization of the 33rd Aero Squadron at Camp Kelly, Texas, on 17 May 1917, about a month after the United States' entry into World War I. The squadron consisted of 160 recruits and was first called \\"2nd Company \\"G\\", Kelly Field\\". Later, the name was changed to \\"1st Company \\"F\\", Kelly Field\\".Gorrell, Series E, Vol. 7 Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Vol. 3, Part 3 On 23 June 1917 the 33rd Aero Squadron was organized from these recruits. After rudimentary indoctrination into the Army at Kelly Field, the squadron was given orders for overseas duty in France, and proceeded to Fort Totten, New York on 15 August. =Across the Atlantic= On 22 August they were transported to the Port of Entry, Hoboken, New Jersey, and were boarded on the . The next day, they left Pier 59, en route to Halifax, Nova Scotia where the ship anchored awaiting for a convoy. Finally, on 5 September, the convoy was formed and the trans-Atlantic journey began. On the night of 14 September, two red rockets were fired from an accompanying destroyer that had spotted a submarine periscope. The destroyer dropped depth charges on the submarine, and the Baltic made a sudden turn to port, that caused both men and anything loose aboard the ship to move. Suddenly a large explosion was heard and five long blasts were made by the ship's whistle and everyone on board was ordered to report to their assigned lifeboats. The Baltic's captain announced that a torpedo had struck the ship, but it had only made a glancing blow on the bow; that the emergency pumps were working and there was no danger. =Third Aviation Instruction Center= The next morning the ship arrived at Liverpool, England; the squadrons on the Baltic being the first American airmen to land there. The 33rd was boarded on a train and proceeded to Southampton where it was stationed at a rest camp, arriving at 1:00 am on 16 September. At Southampton, fifty men of the squadron were detached to the Royal Flying Corps for three months training as aircraft mechanics. The remainder of the squadron were to proceed to France. The squadron arrived at Le Havre, then continued by train to Etampes, France, arriving on the 19th. At Etampes, the squadron was divided into three detachments for training at different aircraft schools in France, and were designated as the 33rd Aero Squadron Detachments. The detachments were sent to Paris, Clermont-Ferrand and Lyon. In addition, 18 men were sent to Issoudun Aerodrome to help construct the Third Aviation Instruction Center. Third Aviation Instruction Center, Issodun Aerodrome, Summer 1918 The squadron was recombined at Issodun Aerodrome just after Christmas Day, 1917. The men had been thoroughly trained in aircraft assembly, engine maintenance and the other skills needed for them to do their work at the Third Aviation Instruction Center. The men from England arrived on 14 January, and they had become instructors in pistol, rifle, and machine-gunnery. The duties of the squadron became the maintenance of the training aircraft, primarily French Nieuports at the school, which had been set up by the Training Section, AEF to train American pursuit pilots prior to them being sent into combat at the Front. In their off-hours, the men engaged in sports such as boxing and football. Athletics was an important part of the duty at Issodun, giving the squadron, which was widely divided around the station, an esprit-de-corps and helped build morale. In addition to the aircraft work, squadron members were also engaged in expanding the 3rd AIC as necessary, erecting additional buildings and aircraft hangars as new airfields were required as training was expanded with additional pilots and aircraft. The numbers of aircraft accidents increased in relation to the increase of pilots going through training. Some of these accidents were found to be caused by a long row of large trees to the north of one of the fields. Those were cut down to give the students additional unobstructed space for landings and takeoffs. Overlapping airfields were also causing a problem with the increased number of aircraft, and additional airfields, away from the main base, were acquired and set up to relieve that problem. Severe storms, especially in the summer caused hangars to be torn up and airplanes to be damaged by high winds or flying debris. The work of the mechanics, in particular, could be quite dangerous as men were severely injured by propeller blades, and in one case, a squadron member working on the field was killed when another plane, attempting a takeoff, instead swerved and ran into the plane he was working on. During the month of September 1918, training was especially intense as new pilots, to be assigned to the new Second Army Air Service, began to arrive for instruction. By the time of the Armistice on 11 November, the men of the squadron held responsible positions in many of the support areas of the Third Aviation Instruction Center. Although they did not enter combat, the men provided the means to train the pilots who went to the front and gave them the best of training so they might accomplish their work. =Demobilization= The 33rd remained at Issodun until the end of December 1918 when orders were received to proceed to the 1st Air Depot, Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome, France, for demobilization. From Colombey, the squadron was moved to a staging camp under the Services of Supply at Bordeaux, France, in January waiting for a date to report to a base port for transportation home. In mid-March, the squadron boarded a troop ship, arriving in New York on 5 April. From there, the 33rd moved to Mitchel Field, New York where the men were demobilized and returned to civilian life.Gorrell, Series O The 33rd Aero Squadron was demobilized on 14 April 1919 at Mitchel Field, New York.Clay, p. 1398 Inter-war years 33rd Pursuit Squadron Consolidated P-30, Langley Field, Virginia, 1937 The 33rd Pursuit Squadron was reconstituted as a regular Army Air Service unit on 24 March 1923, but remained inactive. By 1929, the squadron was partially organized at Kelly Field as a Regular Army Inactive unitRegular Army Inactive units were units that were constituted in the regular army. Although they were not activated, they were organized with reserve personnel during the 1920s and early 1930s. Even though they had reserve personnel assigned, they were not Organized Reserve units. Because they had no regular personnel they were still considered inactive in the regular army. Clay, p. vi with reserve personnel and its members trained as individual reservists at Kelly Field. On 25 June 1932 its reservists were transferred and it was activated at Langley Field, Virginia. It was equipped with Boeing P-12s, and in 1933 some Curtiss P-6 Hawk pursuit planes and trained primarily on coastal defense patrols. Assigned to the 8th Pursuit Group, the squadron continued to fly pursuit planes, receiving new front-line aircraft for testing and evaluation. These included the Consolidated P-30, Curtiss P-36 Hawk, Curtiss YP-37 and Northrop A-17 Dive Bomber. The squadron was redesignated as the 33rd Pursuit Squadron (Fighter) on 6 December 1939; It moved to Mitchel Field, New York in March 1940 after the breakout of World War II in Europe. It was redesignated as an interceptor squadron, and shortly afterwards received early-model Curtiss P-40C Warhawks. Its mission was the air defense of the New York City area. World War II The squadron was deployed to Iceland with P-40 Warhawk fighters as part of the Iceland Base Command (IBC) as part of a bilateral agreement with the Icelandic Government to provide air defense of their nation. The squadron departed from New York Harbor on 27 July 1941 on the }, arriving off Iceland on 6 August 1941. The squadron flew its P-40s off the carrier, and landed at Kaldadarnes Airfield, near Reykjav√≠k where it replaced a Royal Air Force squadron which withdrew to the United Kingdom. It operated from Kaldadarnes until Patterson Field was completed in July 1942.Conn, Engleman & Fairchild 33rd Pursuit Squadron P-40C Warhawk, Kaldadarnes Airfield, Iceland, 1941. Additional fighter squadrons were sent to Iceland after the United States entry into World War II, and the 33rd was reassigned to the new 342nd Composite Group in September 1942, and the squadron received additional Bell P-39 Airacobras. Along with the air defense mission, the 33rd also provided escort patrols for Air Transport Command operations flying through Iceland as part of the North Atlantic air ferry route, and antisubmarine patrols. With the completion of Meeks Field in March 1943, headquarters of the 342nd was moved there, however, due to congestion with Air Transport Command ferrying traffic, the 33rd operated primarily from Patterson Field. German aircraft, operating from bases in Occupied Norway, were first engaged near Iceland on 28 April 1942 and had been followed by a three months' lull. Then in late July three more encounters took place. Encounters between German aircraft and the 342nd continued until the summer of 1943 when the last enemy aircraft (a Junkers Ju 88) was intercepted on 5 August. After that, with the Germans on the defensive in Europe, the Luftwaffe was engaged in other activities elsewhere.Guarding the United States and its Outposts The 342nd was inactivated in March 1944 and the squadron came under the direct control of the 24th Composite Wing. The P-40s and P-39s were replaced with new Republic P-47D Thunderbolts, however, with the Germans in full retreat after D-Day, the 24th was disestablished and the 33rd remained in Iceland as a defensive measure under IBC until the end of the war when it was inactivated. Tactical Air Command In April 1953, the 33rd Fighter-Bomber Squadron was activated as part of the 37th Fighter-Bomber Group, at Clovis Air Force Base, New Mexico under Tactical Air Command (TAC). The 37th FBG was assigned to Clovis to replace the 50th FBG which was deployed to West Germany as part of USAFE. However, the 37th was neither manned or equipped due to personnel and equipment shortages and was inactivated on 25 June 1953. Lt Col Gary L. North, the 33rd FS commander; the crew chief; and assistant crew chief, pose with his F-16 Fighting FalconAircraft is General Dynamics F-16D Block 42H Fighting Falcon, Serial 90-778. Lt Col North flew this plane when he shot down an Iraqi MiG-25 over the No-fly zone on 27 December 1992 during Operation Southern Watch. The 33rd was again re-activated at the newly opened Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina by TAC as the 33rd Fighter-Day Squadron as part of the 342nd FDG on 25 July 1956. The 342nd was equipped with a mixed assortment of aircraft, the most modern being five RF-80A Shooting Stars. These aircraft were considered to be at Myrtle Beach on an interim status, as North American Aircraft established a training facility at the base for F-100 Super Sabre orientation. Although on paper a fully functioning wing, the efforts and activities of the 342nd FDW were directed to reach operational capabilities by overcoming the problems and obstacles inherent in the activation of a new fighter wing on a base still largely under construction. The 342nd FDW lasted 117 days until 18 November 1956 when the Air Force inactivated the unit and activated the 354th Fighter-Day Wing to replace it, and the men and aircraft of the 33rd Fighter-Day Squadron were transferred to the newly activated 353rd Fighter Day Squadron.History of the 342d Fighter-Day Wing, 354th TFW History Office, 1956, Air Force Historical Research Agency Reactivated a third time by Tactical Air Command on 15 October 1969, at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, this time as the 33rd Tactical Reconnaissance Training Squadron, and assigned to the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. The 33rd assumed the personnel and equipment of provisional 4415th Combat Crew Training Squadron, being equipped with McDonnell RF-4C Phantom II reconnaissance aircraft. The mission of the squadron at Shaw was to train newly assigned pilots in the tactical reconnaissance mission. In 1982, as the 363rd converted to a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon tactical fighter wing, the 33rd was inactivated on 1 October 1982 when its reconnaissance training mission ended.History of the 20th Fighter Wing and Shaw Air Force Base, Office of History 20th Fighter Wing.

Parliamentarian propaganda alleged that the dog was \\"endowed\\" with magical powers. Boy accompanied his master into battle and was killed at the battle of Marston Moor on 2 July 1644. Origins Lapland Lady' who had been transformed into a white dog. Boy was first given to Prince Rupert when he was imprisoned in the fortress of Linz during the Thirty Years War.Spencer, p.42. The Earl of Arundel, an Englishman who had grown concerned about Rupert's plight, gave him the animal to keep him company during his confinement. The dog was a rare breed of white hunting poodle. There were probably two poodles, one black and one white, given to Rupert in Germany. The black was lost early on in the war; it was the white survivor who became notorious. It was sometimes called \\"Puddle\\" (for \\"poodle\\"), but it's famous as being called \\"Boy\\"; although it might have been female. Propaganda was put about that Boy had possession of dark powers as a ‚Äòdog-witch‚Äô Boy was sufficiently impressive and famous across Europe that the Ottoman Sultan of the day, Murad IV, requested that his ambassador attempt to find him a similar animal. Boy accompanied Rupert during his travels until 1644. Propaganda and magical powers Pro-Parliamentary Pamphlet of 1643Boy accompanied his master from 1642 to 1644 during the English Civil War. Another Pro-Parliamentary Pamphlet of 1643 Rupert was the iconic Royalist cavalier of the conflict and was frequently the subject of Parliamentarian propaganda.Purkiss, 2007, p.175. Boy, who often accompanied Rupert into battle, featured heavily in this, and was widely suspected of being a witch's familiar. There were numerous accounts of Boy's abilities; some suggested that he was the Devil in disguise.Spencer, p.127. John Cleveland and other Royalist satirists and parodists mocked these Parliamentarian attitudes and produced lampoons that satirised the alleged \\"superstition\\" and \\"credulity\\" of their opponents; Cleveland claimed that Boy was Prince Rupert's shapeshifting familiar, and of demonic origins.Purkiss, 2001, p.276; Stoyle, pp.22-6. Other satirists suggested that Boy was a \\"Lapland Lady\\" who had been transformed into a white dog. Boy was also \\"able\\" to find hidden treasure, was invulnerable to attack, could catch bullets fired at Rupert in his mouth, and prophesy as well as the 16th century soothsayer, Mother Shipton.Purkiss, 2007, p.377. Royalist soldiers also promoted Boy, as their adopted mascot, to the rank of Sergeant-Major-General.Wedgwood, p.148. Reportedly, Boy had other endearing attributes, such as cocking his leg when he heard the name of John Pym, leader of the Parliamentarian forces.Stoyle, pp.22-6. He was also alleged to have performed for Charles I, slept in Prince Rupert's bed, and played with Princes Charles, James and Harry and Princess Henrietta, and was often fed roast beef and capon breast by Charles I himself. Death A contemporary depiction of Boy's death Boy died during the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. He had been left safely tied up in the Royalist camp, but escaped and chased after Rupert. The battle went badly for the Royalists, and Rupert was forced to flee the field; Boy was killed during the ensuing fighting. He was prominently depicted in woodcut scenes drawn of the battle at the time, lying upside down, dead;Gaunt, p.41. Simon Ash, a contemporary historian of the event, drew specific attention to the death of this 'much spoken of' dog.Bence-Jones, p.50.

The app used face recognition technology to search a database of voluntarily participating Facebook users to match people based on appearance. The software's algorithm analyzed face attributes like skin color, face structure and angles of the face. Once matched, users could contact their look-alike via their Facebook profile. Coke Zero claimed the inspiration for Facial Profiler came from the drink itself. The tagline for the project was: \\"If Coke Zero has Coke's taste, is it possible someone out there has your face?\\" Building the face database Facial Profiler's initial phase, launched in September 2009, involved the creation of a \\"face database\\". Faces were gathered from photos that users personally uploaded and tagged to Facebook, stored photos uploaded from user hard drives and webcam photos taken via the app itself.

Registering a moment magnitude of 6.7, it killed more than 300 people, damaging structures and buildings across the Irian Jaya province. Indonesia is highly active in terms of seismicity and volcanic eruptions, with a subduction zone and many faults. It is neighbored by several tectonic plates. Such earthquakes pose a significant threat to life in the area through earthquakes and also tsunamis.  Geology  Indonesia, one of the most seismically active places in the world, hosts hundreds of islands, many with volcanoes. It is an island arc, composed by a subduction zone (in the Sunda Trench) and islands. Unlike most subduction zones, the Sunda Trench is parallel to the chain of islands to which it corresponds, creating strike-slip faulting. Indonesia itself is surrounded by multiple tectonic plates ‚Äì namely the Pacific, the Southeast Asia lithospheric, and the Indo-Australian Plates ‚Äì causing it to be a so-called hotspot for both seismic and volcanic activity. The epicenter was in Papua Province, in the Irian Jaya Province. The orientation and type of faulting is uncertain, due to a poorly constrained focal mechanism but is thought to have been a reverse fault.  Damage and casualties  Spawning enormous landslides, the earthquake left at least 305 people dead and more than 1,000 missing. Entire villages were covered by debris. It was described as \\"strong\\" by The New York Times. The earthquake caused huge landslides, which cascaded into the villages below the mountains, destroying more than 150 homes. The debris from these flows blocked transportation by road, \\"cutting off more than 2,000 area residents\\". Relief efforts took several days.  Future threats  Indonesia is known for deadly earthquakes, primarily the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which killed more than 227,000 people. Earthquakes along the subduction zone at Sunda and on the Great Sumatran fault pose a serious threat to life, especially in the form of tsunamis. A 2005 study found that stress on at least these two zones was at a heightened level, and both have been active. The Sunda Trench zone has since produced the 2006 Pangandaran earthquake and tsunami, while the Great Sumatran fault has not produced an earthquake since the 2004 event.

She served as Norwegian Minister of Social Affairs from 1948 to 1953. She was born in Sandnes as a daughter of Hans Aasland (1855‚Äì1901) and Hanna Marie Nielsen (1857‚Äì1957). She took the examen artium in 1916, enrolled at the Royal Frederick University and graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1922. She worked for the district stipendiary magistrate in Alta for a short time, and then worked for the Norwegian National Women's Council from 1924 to 1931, as a prison inspector from 1931 to 1936 and labour inspector from 1936 to 1945. In 1945 she briefly served as the director of Bredtveit women's prison, which had been a concentration camp during World War II's occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. Later in 1945, when Gerhardsen's Second Cabinet assumed office, Aasland became a consultative minister in the Ministry of Social Affairs. She held this post until 1948, when she succeeded Sven Oftedal as Minister of Social Affairs. She was the first female head of a government ministry (Kirsten Hansteen had preceded Aasland as minister in 1945, but as consultative minister), and also the first female government minister belonging to the Labour Party. She was also a member of Oslo city council from 1945 to 1947. Assessments of Aasland's accomplishments in the position have been mixed. According to historian and political scientist Trond Nordby she was a particularly weak government minister, as she was \\"not able to carry through anything\\" (this claim was built on interviews with Aasland's successors Rakel Seweriin and Gudmund Harlem). After stepping down as government minister, Aasland worked as an assistant secretary in the Ministry of Social Affairs. She was also a board member of the Norwegian People's Aid. She died in August 1962 in Oslo.

Shortly thereafter, he led the drive to build modern housing for low income residents of Indianapolis to improve conditions in the city. Early life=Family and background Joe Rand Beckett was born the son of Wymond Joe Beckett and Florence Ohio Rand in Indianapolis on March 2, 1891. His grandfather, Joe Smirthwinte Beckett was from Sheffield, England, and settled in Dearborn County, Indiana, in about 1837. His mother was the granddaughter of Thomas Rand, an immigrant from Belfast, Ireland, who fought in the Revolutionary War and settled in Dearborn County in about 1811. Beckett graduated from Emmerich Manual High School in Indianapolis in 1910 and graduated from the University of Illinois in 1914, where he studied architecture. He attended a predecessor of the now Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law and was admitted to the bar in 1916. Shortly thereafter, he partnered with his father and they formed the law practice of Beckett and Beckett in Indianapolis. Family Tragedy Joe Rand Beckett and his wife had only one child, Joe Rand Beckett, Jr., who was born on May 6, 1918. According to newspaper reports, he was a bright, talented youth who was about to attend the Culver Military Academy in the Fall. Near dusk on May 29, 1932, while his parents were out of town in Oxford, Ohio, he was accidentally shot and killed by a playmate with a 38 caliber pistol. Military service A veteran of World War I, Mr. Beckett attended the first officers' training camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison in 1917, when he was commissioned a first lieutenant. He was promoted to captain of artillery and served overseas. Active in the American Legion, he was past commander of the McIlvaine-Kothe Post. He also served as state legislative chairman of the Legion. He was an army reserve officer for several years advancing to the rank of major. Philanthropy Joe Rand and Mary Ann Beckett are recognized by the Laura Githens Society of the Indianapolis Zoo for including them in their estate plans. Legacy Lockefield Gardens :The headline in the Indianapolis Times in early September 1933 came as a surprise to most residents of the Hoosier capital: \\"$4,460,000 Loan Will Help City to Banish Slums.\\" The accompanying story, datelined Washington, D.C., explained that tentative approval had been given for federal funds to \\"finance elimination of slums and construction of low-cost housing units in the Indianapolis Negro section.\\" The proposed program, noted the reporter, had been \\"put through without publicity\\" by a planning committee of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, \\"the representatives of which manipulated secretly to obtain the approval of the federal works board.\\" :Precise details are lacking, but available evidence suggests that perhaps as early as fall 1932, and certainly by spring 1933, some Indianapolis residents were discussing housing conditions and what might be done to improve them in the Hoosier capital. One such individual was Joe Rand Beckett, a local architect and attorney, who, as his obituary put it years later, \\"pioneered in the building of modern housing for low-income groups\\". As a member of the board of directors of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, Beckett reported in mid-May 1933 to his colleagues \\"on the progress to date of the Planning and Housing Committee,\\" of which he was the chairman. ‚ÄîRobert G Barrows (June 2007) Joe Rand Beckett was the Chairman of the Housing and Planning Committee and board member of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce instrumental in obtaining the loan for Indianapolis during the New Deal era during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency.

The dam impounds Sly Park Creek and Hazel Creek, natural tributaries of the North Fork Cosumnes River, to form a , reservoir called Jenkinson Lake. It was constructed as part of the American River Division of the Central Valley Project to provide irrigation water to a portion of El Dorado County, California. The dam was begun on May 1953, with clearing operations, and was completed in mid 1955. The earthfill Sly Park Dam is high, with a hydraulic height of , and long. Its auxiliary dam is high and long. The spillway of Sly Park Dam is actually in the auxiliary dam: it is a concrete chute long and can carry per second, while the outlet works at the foot of the dam can carry per second. The drainage area of Sly Park Creek behind the dam is . The Camino Conduit diverts water roughly west from the Jenkinson Reservoir for irrigation purposes. Water is also diverted from Camp Creek into Jenkinson Lake to increase the total water yield.  Jenkinson Lake watershed  Hazel creek tunnel diverts water into Jenkinson Lake. The Jenkinson Lake watershed consists of the approximately 16.5 square mile area between Sly Park Dam and the Cold Canyon Tributary of Sly Park Creek.Sanitary Watershed Survey for Reservoir One, Reservoir A, Outingdale Water Treatment Facilities. El Dorado Irrigation District Water Quality Division. 1996. This area includes both forks of Sly Park Creek, Hazel Creek, and the Cold Canyon Tributary of Sly Park Creek. Jenkinson Lake receives insufficient inflow from this area and additional water is diverted from outside the watershed through the Camp Creek Diversion Tunnel to meet demand.Watershed Sanitary Survey Update 2013. El Dorado Irrigation District. February 2014. The area played a significant role in the gold rush era of California's history.  Climate  Like most of California, the Jenkinson Lake watershed has a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Located on the windward side of the Sierra Nevada, the watershed receives a large amount of precipitation relative to other reservoirs in the Central Valley, such as Folsom Lake. The area receives an annual average precipitation of 51.6 inches. Precipitation typically occurs October through May as rain and snow, though the reservoir's watershed is low enough in elevation that continued runoff from snow pack is not significant. The reservoir is necessary to store water for use during the dry summer months.  Environment  Elevation in the watershed ranges from 3400 to 5600 feet. The area is mountainous and consists of steep slopes and rocky outcrops. Soils in the area are deep with high water holding capacity. There is a high potential for landslides and the subsequent siltation of streams. The major mineral deposit in the area is gold. This was an important factor in the development of the area. Gold and other mineral deposits in the area may also be rich in iron and sulfides, which may impact water quality. Vegetation in the area consists of oak woodland and mixed conifer forest. Common softwood tree species include ponderosa pine and douglas fir. Hardwood tree species include blue oak and black oak. Manzanita, western mountain mahogany, and poison oak are common understory plants, in addition to annual grasses. Vegetation plays an important role in stabilizing slopes in the area. Removal of vegetation by logging, development, and fire may increase erosion and the risk of landslides. Vegetation also provides important habitat for wildlife. Shoreline at Jenkinson Lake The Jenkinson Lake watershed supports a wide variety of animal species. Mammals include California mule deer, American black bear, and mountain lion. Common birds include the mountain chickadee and stellar's jay. Raptors include golden eagle, red-tailed hawk, and great horned owls. Reptiles include rattlesnake, gopher snake, and rubber boa. Wildlife makes the area an attractive recreation destination. Some mammals may also carry giardia, which may impact water quality.  Land use  Historical land use in the area included mining, ranching and timber harvesting and milling. Following the discovery of gold in California, miners quickly populated the area. The development of agriculture and commerce followed the miners. Large amounts of water were required for hydraulic mining, and the miners built many water conveyance structures, some of which are still used today. The gold rush was the first significant human impact on the watershed. Before Sly Park Dam was built, the area where the reservoir now exists was known as Sly Park Ranch. Grazing and agriculture took place at Sly Park Ranch. There was also a timber mill, Sly Park Mill, located near the second dam on Sly Park Creek. Current land use in the watershed is predominately Forest/Recreational use. Most of the land is publicly owned. The major land owners are El Dorado Irrigation District, the US Bureau of Reclamation, and the USDA Forest Service. Private landowners include the timber companies Sierra Pacific Industries and Georgia Pacific, which have had a large influence on timber management in the region. Smaller logging operations are authorized on the Forest Service lands as well as recreational uses. Recreational use includes off highway vehicle trails, mountain biking, hunting, and horseback riding among other activities.  Water use  Water from Jenkinson Lake is used for municipal water supply, irrigation, and recreation. Historically, irrigation water for agriculture was the greatest water user. As the area develops and the population grows, municipal and commercial water users become more important. Municipal users are now the primary water users of water from Jenkinson Lake, though agriculture is still a significant user. Future population growth, climate change, and water reuse technology and conservation will influence water use in the future.  Municipal users  Municipal water is the fastest growing water use within EID's service area. Water from Jenkinson Lake is treated at the Reservoir One Treatment Plant West of the Reservoir. The water is then distributed throughout EID's service area. Jenkinson Lake is not the only source of municipal water for the system; it draws water from several sources including Folsom Lake. However, the contribution of water from Jenkinson Lake to the overall water system is substantial. Jenkinson Lake is the largest reservoir dedicated to water supply that is operated by EID. Many areas in the district's service area are isolated, either by topography or limited water distribution infrastructure, and rely on water from Jenkinson Lake. Pumping municipal water from Bureau of Reclamation operated Folsom Lake is too costly for some areas in the district.  Agricultural users  Agriculture remains a significant water user despite the rapid urban development in the area. El Dorado County contains many orchards, vineyards, and pastures that demand large quantities of irrigation water seasonally. Apple Hill Growers Association farms and ranches are located in nearby Camino. Apple hill includes orchards, Christmas tree farms, pumpkin patches and other agriculture related tourist destinations. While traditional livestock grazing in the area has declined since it was first settled, agricultural water use will likely continue to grow.  Recreational users  Recreation on the lake is administered by EID. Recreation on the lake includes boating, hiking, horseback riding, and camping. Recreational use has increased over the last several years. Though recreational users consume a negligible amount of water from Jenkinson Lake, recreational activities have the potential to impact water quality. Pollution from boats, pit toilets, erosion caused by off highway vehicles may pollute the water sources. Because of the lake's recreation potential, population in the area is seasonal. There are many vacation homes in the immediate area of the reservoir. The seasonal population places greater demands on the water system during the summer months, during which recreational opportunities are numerous.  Future water use  In general, the demand for water is increasing as supplies become less reliable. Increased urbanization and suburban development in EID's service area places greater demand on water supplies and creates more wastewater and stormwater that must be dealt with. Agriculture, while grazing has become less common, other potentially water intensive crops have become more popular, such as fruit trees and grapes in orchards and vineyards. Agriculture, in addition to the area's naturally scenic qualities, has also increased tourism and recreational use. The population in the area is seasonal and places greater demand on the water system during the time of the year when supplies are most scarce: summer and fall. Climate change has the potential to reduce the water available for storage, and the area has few other water resources, with many areas remote enough to be isolated from the piping required to supply water from the rest of the Central Valley Project. Purple pipe used for reclaim water in new homes. EID is addressing future water use in several ways. Municipal conservation is important in reducing demand. Encouraging water saving appliances, faucets, toilets, and shower heads will reduce municipal use without requiring the public to ration their water. Leak detection and piping improvements are also being used to reduce the water lost in the distribution system. The most important water conservation measure may be the reuse of wastewater, also called reclaimed water, for urban landscaping and golf courses. As the area develops, more wastewater is produced. By reusing the water for irrigation municipal water use is greatly reduced, as nearly half of most residential water use goes to landscaping.

Development  The FRV project begun in 1981-82 as a joint-venture by the private firm Kew Engineering Ltd of Gwelo (now Gweru) to meet a requirement from the Government of Zimbabwe for a home-built light armoured vehicle intended to the export market. After the prototype was completed, the new Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI) demonstrated the Gazelle to the Kenyan Army, but no orders were ever placed and production did not proceed as expected. Although the prototype was also tested by the Zimbabwe National Army's (ZNA) 1st Mechanised Battalion in Mozambique, the ZNA never formally evaluated or adopted the vehicle and eventually the whole project was discontinued.  General description  Built on a Mercedes-Benz U1100 Unimog 416 2.5 ton light truck chassis, it consisted of an armoured hull of welded ballistic steel plate incorporating one rear and two side doors. The overall design is very similar to the French ACMAT TPK 4.2 PSF armoured car, with exception of the glacis which had a small conventional windscreen on the right side and on the left side a projecting, box-type canopy of three framed windows of bullet- and splinter-proof glass to give the driver better lateral vision. This peculiar element of design was probably inspired by South African-made armoured vehicles such as the Buffel, which entered service with the South African Defence Force (SADF) at the time. The Gazelle had a five-man crew ‚Äì driver, commander, gunner and two infantry scouts. Though a very fast and robust vehicle with a good off-road performance the Gazelle however, unlike most former Rhodesian and Zimbabwean armoured vehicles, lacked protection against landmines and had not for this single design flaw, it certainly would have been a commercial success. Is no longer being marketed. Protection The hull was made of ballistic 10mm mild steel plate; front windscreen and projecting canopy windows had 40mm bullet- proof laminated glass.  Armament  A one-man turret similar to the Mine Protected Combat Vehicle (MPCV), which accommodated either 12.7mm or 14.5mm Heavy Machine-Guns (HMGs) could be fitted on the top roof though the vehicle also served without it and with other armament such as a pintle-mounted 20mm autocannon or a FN MAG-58 7.62√ó51mm NATO light machine-gun.

It is closely related to the stable homeomorphism conjecture (now proved) which states that every orientation-preserving homeomorphism of Euclidean space is stable. Statement If S and T are topological spheres in Euclidean space, with S contained in T, then it is not true in general that the region between them is an annulus, because of the existence of wild spheres in dimension at least 3. So the annulus theorem has to be stated to exclude these examples, by adding some condition to ensure that S and T are well behaved. There are several ways to do this. The annulus theorem states that if any homeomorphism h of Rn to itself maps the unit ball B into its interior, then B ‚àí h(interior(B)) is homeomorphic to the annulus Sn‚àí1√ó[0,1].

The porch itself is described by Williams as \\"having decoration and style so exuberant that one is tempted to suspect that some 'antiquarian' embellishment has been introduced; this especially at the sides which have shouldered arched openings ovolo moulded. Unlike most 17th century porches, it is of squat single storey and has a restored pediment gable to the front where the four- centred arch is ovolo moulded with egg and dart decoration on the arch. It is flanked by Corinthian columns on pedestals supporting a frieze and dentilled course. In the gable is a strapwork motif\\" In 2003 an application to extend one of the agricultural outbuildings and use it as a farm shop was rejected by North Somerset Council.

Born in Nijmegen (the Netherlands) on 13 August 1860, Potjes began his music studies at the age of 7. He received the rudiments of piano from P. Van Merkestein, and learned harmony and counterpoint from Gr√©goire Van Dyck in Boxmeer. From 1878 to 1880 he attended composition classes by Richard Hol. After that, at Cologne, he was pupil of Ferdinand Hiller (composition) and of Jacob Kwast (piano).Biografie door Annelies Focquaert He graduated from the University of Belgium in 1887.Edouard Potjes papers, circa 1927-1931 After completing his studies, Potjes established in Antwerp as a music teacher and in 1885 he had the opportunity to be heard by Liszt; following his advice he applied for the position of piano teacher at the Strasbourg PƒÅdagogium and was accepted. He soon left Strasbourg to make an artistic tour in the Netherlands. In the following year (1887), he moved back to Antwerp, continuing to make numerous artistic tours in England and France. When the professor of piano at the Conservatory of Ghent, Max Heynderickx, died on 12 June 1893, a competition was held for his replacement. Several talented artists applied for the position, but the jury decided for Potjes, and he was confirmed by a royal decree on 29 December 1893. In 1917 he resigned the post he had held for twenty-two years as head of the Virtuoso Piano Department at the Royal Conservatory of Ghent to immigrate to the United States as a war refugee. He moved to Seattle in 1922, and became a U.S. citizen in 1924. He toured many European countries as a concert pianist, and composed several grand operas. Potjes taught piano, harmony and composition, and taught at the Cornish School for one year. After leaving Cornish School, Potjes spent the rest of his days teaching private classes and composing, until his death on 4 January 1931 in Seattle, United States. In 15 November 1921, Potjes was designated Officer of the Order of Leopold by royal decree. Potjes was a virtuoso talent as evidenced by the brilliant success he obtained in each of his performances in concerts; it can be cited his Recital in Li√®ge dedicated to the members of the Legia in January 1896; the one he presented in January 1897 at the Salle Pleyel in Paris, where he was applauded for his brilliant performance of works of very different characters: Bach, Tausig, Liszt, Chopin, Saint-Sa√´ns, Rachmaninoff, Schumann, Beethoven, etc. And the \\"Piano Recital Beethoven\\", at the Cercle des Concerts d'hiver in January 1899, where he delighted the audience with a masterful performance of four Beethoven sonatas.

It is built on a site bordered by Stanton Street to the north, Columbia Street to the east, Delancey Street to the south, and Pitt Street to the west.  History  The development is named after Samuel Gompers (1850‚Äì1924), an Englishman who immigrated to the United States in 1863, where he was a cigar maker, labor unionist, and workers' rights activist, who founded an organization that would eventually become the American Federation of Labor. In his early life, Gompers lived three blocks from the site. NYCHA broke ground for the development in 1961 and the project was completed on April 30, 1964. The development was designed by Lama, Proskauer, & Prober. The relatively high cost of land for the Gompers Houses development, $13 per square foot, forced the New York City Housing Authority to build twenty story towers rather than the preferred six story buildings. As with many of the housing projects built on the Lower East Side in the 1950s and 1960s, Gompers Houses is built in the \\"tower in the park\\" style.

Biography=Origins and early career Flavius Patricius was born in Phrygia, but otherwise nothing is known of his early life. Raised to the consulate in 500 along with Anastasius's nephew Hypatius, he was already considered elderly at the time. In the same year, he was placed as magister militum praesentalis (one of the two magistri militum \\"in the presence\\" of the emperor), a post he held until Anastasius's death in July 518.. The bishop and historian Zacharias of Mytilene characteristically calls him \\"upright and trustworthy, but with slight intelligence.\\". Campaigns against Persia In 502, the Anastasian War with Sassanid Persia broke out. Thus in 503, along with Hypatius and Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus, Patricius was sent east to campaign against the Persians. He invaded the Persian province of Arzanene, sacking various forts and taking prisoners, before returning to join forces with Hypatius. While Areobindus was detailed to keep watch on the Persian stronghold of Nisibis and on the army of Shah Kavadh I (r. 488‚Äì531) from Dara, Patricius and Hypatius, with the main force of 40,000 men (an enormous army for the time), were tasked with the recapture of Amida. Although the siege of Amida proved fruitless, together they won a skirmish against some Hephthalite Huns. Their success, however, made them careless, allowing them to be surprised by the main Persian army under Kavadh. Defeated, they retreated across the Euphrates to Samosata. In the aftermath of this, Hypatius was recalled, but Patricius stayed on... In early 504, Patricius successfully intercepted a supply convoy for the garrison of Amida. He then defeated the Persian reinforcements, capturing their commanders, and resumed the siege of the city. He pursued the siege vigorously, destroying part of the city's outer walls by undermining them, and ambushing and killing the garrison commander Glones. He was, however, unable to take the city until the end of hostilities. At that point, he arranged the ransom of the city. Involvement in civil war Back in Constantinople, Patricius became involved in the theological disputes that troubled much of Anastasius's reign. During the rebellion of Vitalian, Patricius was used by Anastasius as an ambassador, since he had known both Vitalian and his father, and had promoted the former's career in the past. Nevertheless, due to this friendship, he refused to attack Vitalian's army during his third assault on Constantinople in 515, ostensibly because he feared that he would be accused of treason in the case of a defeat.. Imperial candidacy In 518, at the death of Anastasius, Patricius was put forward as one of the candidates to succeed him by the men of the Scholae Palatinae. His candidacy, however, was not accepted by the imperial bodyguard, the excubitores, who tried to set upon him; his life was saved by the intervention of Justinian, the nephew of the excubitores' commander and eventual emperor, Justin I (r. 518‚Äì527). End of career The last reference to Patricius occurs in November 519, when he was at Edessa, where he was sent to persuade its bishop to accept the Chalcedonian doctrines or abdicate voluntarily. Upon his refusal, Patricius forcibly deposed him and exiled him.

He had a college scholarship to play soccer, but he decided to go to University of Oregon, where he studied Psychology. Efferding competed in bodybuilding since 1988 winning the Mr. Oregon in 1991, placing 6th in the Jr. USA in 1992 and placing 2nd in the Emerald Cup in 1996 and 1997. Efferding started competing in powerlifting in 1996 totaling over 2,000 lbs in the Pepsi Region 8 challenge, deadlifting 782 lbs raw. In 1997 Efferding stopped competing in both sports in order to pursue business opportunities, but continued lifting. At the age of 38, Efferding came back to bodybuilding and competed in the 2006 Seattle Emerald Cup, winning the Superheavyweight class weighing 235 lbs. In 2008, he came back and won the Emerald Cup Heavyweight class and overall award. In February 2009 at the age of 41 Efferding totaled 2,070 lbs at the APA \\"All RAW\\" Northwest Regional Championships in the non drug-tested category] (shown in the results list as \\"NT\\"), setting 2 American records in the open category. Efferding earned his IFBB Pro Card on July 17, 2009 winning the Superheavyweight class and overall award at the Masters Nationals Bodybuilding Championships weighing 259 lbs. On September 19, 2009, Efferding competed at the Southern Powerlifting Federation (SPF) POWER \\"Stimulus Package\\" Raw Meet in Sacramento, California and totaled 2,221.2 lbs in the 275 lbs category \\\\- just 38 lbs away from all-time raw world record, set in 1972 by Jon Cole. His lifts were an 821 lb squat, a 606.3 lb bench press (earning him a place on the 600 Pound Unequipped Bench Press Hall of Fame), and a 794 lb deadlift. In 2010 Efferding won the title \\"Mr. Olympia 2010 World's Strongest Professional Bodybuilder\\" by benching 628 lbs and deadlifting 800 lbs for a 1,428 lb push/pull total. This set a new record for the world's strongest bodybuilder and beat the previous title holders (Johnnie O. Jackson) record by nearly 100 pounds. On May 15, 2011, Stan entered the 2011 SPF California State Championships and competed raw without knee wraps. He set two all-time world records, squatting 854 lbs and a three lift total of 2,226.6 lbs beating the former world record holder, Konstantin Konstantinovs of Latvia, by over 50 lbs.

Today, it is spelled as Paulstown ‚Äì a village in mid County Kilkenny.

Career Like his father before him, Edmund was the Lord Deputy to his cousin, James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond who was absent from Ireland (and had even given the English title of Earl of Wiltshire in 1449). Edmund first came to attention in 1443 when he instigated the murder of Finan and Dermot MacGillapadraig, the sons of the King of the ruling Irish clan in Ossory. In 1447, Edmund founded the bridge at Carrick-on-Suir ‚Äì the first over the estuary. In 1462, his second cousin John Butler, 6th Earl of Ormond, arrived in Ireland with the objective of opening another front against the Yorkists during the Wars of the Roses. Enlisting Edmund MacRichard's help, he captured Waterford and along with it, the son of the Earl of Desmond. A longtime enemy of the Butlers, Desmond had been encroaching on the weakened Butler patrimony in Co. Tipperary by moving up the Suir valley towards Waterford. Edmund swept down to meet him but was heavily defeated, losing 400 men and was captured at the Battle of Pilltown. Ormond fled and Kilkenny was plundered by the Desmonds. It was said that part of Edmund's ransom was paid with manuscripts from his library including the Psalter of Cashel which contained genealogies, the Calendar of Aengus and a Glossary written by Cormac mac Cuilenn√°in, King Bishop of Cashel, which was the first comparative dictionary written in Europe.

In 1976, Willard Bascom suggested that the deep, anoxic waters of the Black Sea might have preserved ships from antiquity because typical wood-devouring organisms could not survive there. At a depth of 150m, the Black Sea contains insufficient oxygen to support most familiar biological life forms. Meromictic composition and preservation Originally a land-locked fresh water lake, the Black Sea was flooded with salt water from the Mediterranean Sea during the Holocene. The influx of salt water essentially smothered the fresh water below it because a lack of internal motion and mixing meant that no fresh oxygen reached the deep waters,Oƒüuz, T., Latun, V.S., Latif, M.A., Vladimirov, V. L., Sur, H. I., Markov, A. A., Ozsoy, E. Kotovschichkov, B. B., Eremeev, V.N., and Unluata, U., 1993, Circulation in the surface and intermediate layers of the Black Sea, Deep-Sea Research Part I.40: 1597-612. creating a meromictic body of water. The anoxic environment, which is hostile to many biological organisms that destroy wood in the oxygenated waters, provides an excellent testing site for deep water archaeological survey. Archaeology In a series of expeditions beginning around 2000, the NOAA Ocean Exploration program led by Robert Ballard identified what appeared to be ancient shorelines, freshwater snail shells, and drowned river valleys in roughly of water off the Black Sea coast of modern Turkey. The team discovered three ancient wrecks to the west of the town of Sinop at depths of . Wreck A and Wreck C probably date to the late Roman period (2nd-4th century AD), while Wreck B probably dates to the Byzantine period (5th to 7th century AD). To the east of Sinop, the team discovered a remarkably well-preserved wreck at a depth, in Black Sea's deep anoxic waters. The vessel's entire hull and cargo are intact, buried in sediments. Its deck structures are also intact, including a mast rising some into the water column. Radiocarbon dating of wood from the wreck provides a date of 410-520 AD This ship has been named \\"Sinop D\\" by the Ballard team. In 2008, Ballard and his team conducted an expedition that focused on the exploration of the sea bed about 15‚Äì30 km west of Sinop, and an additional deep-water survey east and north of the peninsula. Their project had several goals. They sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape, to examine the sea-bed for shipwrecks (where they found Sinop A-D), to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components, and to seek data about an ancient trade route between Sinop and the Crimea indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains. Although Sinop served as a primary trade center in the Black Sea, the wrecks were located west of the trade route predicted by the prevalence of Sinopian ceramics on the Crimean peninsula. On wrecks A-C, mounds of distinctive carrot-shaped shipping jars, called amphorae, were found. They were of a style associated with Sinop and retained much of their original stacking pattern on the sea floor. The jars may have carried a variety of archetypal Black Sea products such as olive oil, honey, wine or fish sauce but the contents are presently unknown because no artifacts were recovered from any of these wreck sites in 2000. The wreck found provided the team with vast information about both the technological changes and trade that occurred in the Black Sea during a period of political, social and economic transition through their study of the ship‚Äôs construction techniques. Studies show that in Sinop during the Byzantine era, they had developed long-distance trading as early as 4500 BC. Sea-trading on the Black Sea was most intense during the period of late antiquity, between the 2nd and 7th centuries AD.Hiebert, F., 2001, Black Sea coastal cultures: trade and interaction, Expedition 43: 11-20 The examination of the four shipwrecks found by Ballard and his team provide the direct evidence for Black Sea maritime trade so well attested by the distribution of ceramics on land. The video images of Shipwreck A that were taken show a wall of shipping jars standing about 2m above the sea-bed. The amphorae highest on the mound had fallen over without displacing those still standing in the rows beneath them, and it is likely that the ship settled upright on the sea-bed, gradually being both buried in and filled with sediment as exposed wood was devoured by the larva or the shipworm. Shipwreck B also consisted of a large pile of amphorae but several types are visible, as are multiple timbers protruding from within the mound and on it. In addition to the Sinop-styles jars, several amphorae similar to examples excavated on the Yassiada Byzantine shipwreck and dating from the 5th to late 6th century AD are present.van Doorninck, F. H. Jr., 2002, Byzantine shipwrecks, in A. Laiou (ed.), The Economic History of Byzantium from the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century I, 899-905. Dumbarton Oaks Studies 30, Washington, DC. Two discrete and mostly buried piles of carrot-shaped shipping jars comprise shipwreck C. The team‚Äôs visit to the site was short and was intended primarily to test survey methodology for deep-water procedures. Shipwreck D provided Ballard and his team with an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction during a time of transition. When observing the sonar signature of Shipwreck D, a long, slender upright feature on the sea- bed, transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200m below the surface. Disappointingly for ship scholars and historians of technology, there are few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together. There are no mortise and tenon fastenings, and no sewing. Shipwreck D may be one of the earliest lateen-rigged ships to be studied by archaeologists. The angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel. A 2007 expedition to the site, however, identified what may be a mast for an artemon, suggesting a different type of vessel.Deepwater investigations of two Byzantine shipwrecks, 2007 The Institute for Exploration Black Sea expeditions relied on remote sensing with side-scan sonar in shallow and deep water to identify potential archaeological sites examined by ROVs. The hypothesis that the anoxic waters of the Black Sea would allow extraordinary organic preservation is borne out by the discovery of Sinop D, the 1,500-year-old shipwreck with excellent preservation of features above the sediment layer.Ballard, Robert D., and Ward, Cheryl, 2004, Deep-water Archaeological Survey in the Black Sea; 2000 Season, The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 33.1: 2-13. In 2016, the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project was initiated, which uncovered 41 shipwrecks off the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea within just a few months of initiation. The ships were documented with 3D photogrammetry, revealing their intricate details. Some of the ships were well preserved and date back to Byzantine times. This technology also has potential for the study of shipwrecks from antiquity. In 2018, a Roman trading vessel which dates back to 2nd‚Äì3rd centuries AD was found near Balaklava, Crimean Peninsula. Also in 2018, a Greek merchant vessel dating to around 400 BC was discovered, almost completely intact, off the coast of the Bulgarian city of Burgas at a depth of roughly by ROV. Thanks to the anoxic environment at this depth the ship was found on its side with its hull, rudder, mast, and decking still all almost completely intact. The contents of the ship's hold was also found to be intact but could not be examined closely as the ships incredible preservation meant the hold remained largely sealed. At over 2,400 years old this wreck is considered the world's oldest intact shipwreck discovered to date.

It extends northwards into the Manchester area and south into Shropshire. The basin possesses something of the character of a half-graben as its deepest extent is along its eastern and southeastern margins, where it is well defined by a series of sub-parallel faults, most important of which is the Red Rock Fault. These faults divide the basin from the older Carboniferous rocks of the Peak District and the North Staffordshire Coalfield. In terms of its architecture, the basin is sometimes considered to be divided into two sub- basins: the more southerly Wem‚ÄìAudlem Sub-basin and the Sandbach‚ÄìKnutsford Sub-basin to its northeast. The basin fill is mainly Permian and Triassic sandstones and mudstones, but it also incorporates economically important halite beds. The sequences referred to the Sherwood Sandstone Group and the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group are the thickest in England. An isolated outlier of Jurassic rocks occurs within the basin at Prees in north Shropshire. The basin is just one part of a wider complex of basins that includes the Worcester Basin, the Stafford Basin and the East Irish Sea Basin. These basins developed while the crust of this region was experiencing east‚Äìwest tension during the Permian period. It is traversed by a series of largely north‚Äìsouth aligned normal faults, some of which help to define the Mid Cheshire Ridge and Alderley Edge, two upstanding areas within the Cheshire Plain.British Geological Survey 1:50K map sheets 97,98, 108-111, 122,123Plant et al (eds) 1999, The Cheshire Basin: basin evolution, fluid movement and mineral resources in a Permo-Triassic rift setting, British Geological Survey Tectonics The Permo-Triassic rocks of the Cheshire basin are heavily faulted. The longer axis of the basin trends towards the NNE, being flanked on the west by the Carboniferous rocks of north Wales and to the east by the Pennine foothills. The dips in the Permo-Triassic rocks reflect the steady swing of the beds round the north-east edge rim of the Cheshire basin, except to the north of Alderley Edge, where a gentle anticlinal fold centred on Wilmslow plunges westward and is intersected by a number of north‚Äìsouth tension faults. Crustal extension controls the tectonic accommodation space available for sediments in rift settings and may be defined by the structural and depositional geometry of sedimentary successions observed on seismic data and the rate of subsidence through time as represented by the accommodation of sediment. The characteristic features of each are dependent on three variables: the time taken for deposition; the interplay between tectonics and eustasy and the lithology (thus facies) of the succession observed. The Sherwood Sandstone Group has been considered to represent a syn-rift phase of fluvial deposition throughout Europe, with the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group interpreted as the succeeding phase of deposition in an evaporitic seaway during post-rift thermal subsidence. More recently, however, there has been the recognition that it is the Mercia Mudstone Group which is seen to thicken markedly into faults imaged on seismic data rather than the Sherwood Sandstone Group. This work demonstrates the Mercia Mudstone Group to be a syn-rift phase of deposition, with the fine grained nature of the sedimentary record at this time controlled by the prevailing arid climate. Such conditions were not conducive to the large-scale and rapid movement of sediments from the hinterlands raised by relative footwall uplift, thus the sediments are fine grained. The minor thickening of the Sherwood Sandstone Group into faults is interpreted to be a combination of minor extension in the early Triassic superimposed on thermal subsidence inherited from the important regional phase of extension in the early Permian. Analysis of the timing of fault growth indicates a larger proportion of fault-controlled, synsedimentary movement occurred during the mid-to-late Triassic (Mercia Mudstones) rather than the early Triassic (Sherwood). Post-Triassic folding Using techniques of seismic sequence stratigraphy the English Permo-Triassic megasequence can be divided into three sequences bounded at the top and base by local or regional unconformities. Construction of a seismic sequence stratigraphy allows the examination of the interaction of tectonics and sedimentation. On this basis the Cheshire Basin can be divided roughly into two areas: a westerly area close to the western basin margin and an easterly area nearer to the Carboniferous WEM/Red Rock Fault. The Red Rock fault ‚Äì really a group of faults ‚Äì is the name given locally to one which happens to throw Carboniferous and Permo-Triassic rocks together. It runs north‚Äìsouth, a trend followed by the Kirkleyditch and the Alderley faults. Seismic interpretation shows that deposition in the western area was essentially post-rift, resulting in packages of parallel reflectors on seismic data. The movements (WEM‚ÄìRed Rock Fault) which in late Carboniferous times initiated the Rossendale Anticline and the Pennine uplift were repeated later probably during the Alpine of Tertiary age, but the major fold of this date resulted in the Cheshire Basin as it is today, in which the Permo-Trias is preserved.

The massacre was one of the most serious outbreaks of anti- Christian violence in Egypt, and the worst since the murder of 21 Coptic Christians in Kosheh in January 2000. Background Coptic Christians form the largest religious minority in the Egypt, and represent between 15% and 20% of a population of over 80 million Egyptians. Estimates of the size of Egypt's Christian population vary from the low government figures of 6 to 7 million to the 15 to 19 million reported by Christian leaders,Ibrahim, Youssef M. \\"Muslims' Fury Falls on Egypt's Christians\\". The New York Times, 15 March 1993. Retrieved 10 October 2008. though estimates vary (see Religion in Egypt). The Coptic community has been targeted by terrorism throughout the past by Islamic extremists, and has faced varying degrees of discriminatory government policies, such as restrictions on building churches and a school curriculum focused on Islam. Since the 1970s, the rise of Islamist movements in Egypt has led to sectarian violence. Disputes over land and inter-faith relationships have sometimes split communities along religious lines, and civil rights groups have criticized local authorities' handling of such cases. Police have been accused of delaying their response to reports of fighting and then simply arresting more Christians than Muslims. Criminal investigations are occasionally discontinued in favor of informal reconciliation meetings.Egypt's anxious Copts 'await next catastrophe', BBC Other forms of anti-Christian discrimination in Egypt include discrimination in hiring in the public sector and staff appointments to public universities, prohibition from studying at Al-Azhar University (a publicly funded institution with approximately half a million students), and barring from certain jobs such as Arabic language teachers. Events Bishop Kyrillos (Cyril), the Coptic Orthodox bishop of Nag Hammadi, had warned the Egyptian police that there had been threats in the days leading up to the Christmas Eve liturgy. For this reason, he decided to end his liturgyl one hour earlier than normal. He told the Associated Press that, for days, he had expected something to happen on Christmas Eve. He said he left the church minutes before the attack, and had to take the back door when a suspiciously driven car swerved near him. Seconds later he heard the mayhem and machine-gun fire. As the Christian worshipers were leaving the Nag Hammadi Cathedral after the Christmas Eve Divine Liturgy, a car pulled up and gunfire was sprayed into the crowd. As a result, eight Copts, all aged between 15 and 23, were killed. Six died immediately, while two more died the following day from severe wounds. One Muslim bystander was also killed in the attack.Egypt arrests Nag Hammadi shooters, Gregg Carlstrom  8 January 2010 Nine other Copts were confirmed wounded, and two Muslims were reportedly wounded in the attack. Aftermath On 8 January 2010, three men from the Berber tribe of Al-Hawara were arrested and charged with premeditated murder in association with the Nag Hammadi massacre. The three accused were Mohamed Ahmed Hassanein, more commonly known as Hamam el-Kamouny, Qurshi Abul Haggag and Hendawi Sayyed. The trial opened on 13 February 2010. Despite initially confessing to the police, they pleaded not guilty to the charges of premeditated murder, putting lives of citizens at risk, and damaging property. The Supreme State Security Court adjourned the trial until 20 March 2010, and the trial was subsequently delayed twelve times. The accused men appeared in court for the final verdict on 16 January 2011. El-Kamouny received a death sentence for the \\"premeditated murder\\" of seven people, as well as for the \\"attempted murder\\" of the nine others who were wounded. The other two defendants were sentenced on 20 February 2011. Motives Egyptian officials suspected that the shooting may have been \\"in revenge for the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl from the Berber tribe of Al-Hawara by a Coptic man\\" in the nearby town of Farshout in November, which at the time led to five days of riots and attacks on Christian businesses and properties in Upper Egypt. A man was arrested and charged with the alleged rape on 21 November 2009. Egyptian reaction Following the Nag Hammadi massacre and the associated attacks, the Egyptian police raided the homes of Coptic Christian families in Nag Hammadi on 10 January 2010, and arrested 22 young Copts, most of whom were teenagers. These Copts were detained at the Nag Hammadi police station for a few days, then transferred to jail in the isolated New Valley Governorate. None of the arrested Copts was ever formally charged with any crime. It was not until two weeks after the massacre that President Hosni Mubarak made his first remarks directly condemning what happened. He stated that \\"The criminal act in Nag Hammadi has made the hearts of Egyptians bleed, whether Copts or Muslims\\". The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) condemned the attack, stating that despite warnings by local church authorities of possible violence during the Coptic holiday, police had not increased security for Christmas. On 9 January 2010, hundreds of people in Cairo demonstrated, carrying placards condemning \\"the shocking silence of the authorities\\" and stating \\"We are All Copts\\". On the same day, Egyptian police arrested 20 people who demonstrated in the town of Bahgura against the Nag Hammadi massacre. On 15 January, 29 Egyptian human rights activists, bloggers, and members of political parties visited Nag Hammadi in order to show solidarity with the Coptic community against the recent attacks on Coptic civilians. All 29 activists were arrested by Egyptian police while on their way to pay their condolences to the families of the victims. The group included prominent activists such as Wael Abbas, members of 6 April Youth Movement, and members of the Democratic Front Party. The group included eight women, one of whom was a French citizen. The activists were detained and interrogated by the prosecutor of the Qena Governorate. A number of them were charged with demonstrating illegally, chanting slogans against the state, and causing disorder. Group members denied these allegations, stating that Egyptian police arrested them when they arrived at the train station, and that the group had not had time to engage in any activities. International reaction The Nag Hammadi massacre gained widespread international attention, and was condemned by Pope Benedict XVI, Lebanese MP Nadim Gemayel, Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini, and Canadian foreign minister Lawrence Cannon. The actions of the Egyptian government in the aftermath of the crime were also strongly condemned by Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director of Human Rights Watch. \\"The Egyptian authorities should be focusing on the causes of the tragic shooting of six Coptic Christians,\\" she stated. \\"Instead, they're arresting activists whose efforts to express their condolences is an important step toward healing sectarian fractures.\\" See also * List of massacres in Egypt * Persecution of Copts * Christianity in Egypt * 2011 Alexandria bombing * 2011 Imbaba Church Attacks References Category:2010 crimes in Egypt Category:Coptic history Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2010 Category:Spree shootings in Egypt Category:Massacres in 2010 Category:Massacres in Egypt Category:Persecution of Copts Category:Pogroms Category:Victims of Islamic terrorism Category:21st-century Oriental Orthodoxy Category:Islamist attacks on churches Category:January 2010 crimes Category:Massacres of Christians Category:2010 murders in Africa Category:2010s murders in Egypt ","title":"Nag Hammadi massacre"},{"id":"25830671","text":"Ann Henricksson and Christiane Jolissaint were the defending champions but only Henricksson competed that year with Gretchen Magers.

Seifert was a Czech-German painter, acclaimed for his female portraits.  History  He was born in Praskolesy (present-day Czech Republic), but within a few months, his family moved to nearby Ho≈ôovice. As a child, he fell seriously ill, could not walk for four years and spent two years in an orthopedic institution. Instead of playing, he began to draw pictures and his artistic talent soon started to emerge. His first teachers were Karel W√ºrbs, inspector of Estates Gallery at Prague Castle, and Alois Kirnig, a landscape painter. After two years of studies at a high school in Mal√° Strana (Lesser Town of Prague), he received an admission to the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich in 1869. In 1876, he opened his own workshop there. Seifert focused on portraits of women, especially on sentimentally mooded heads of girls which became known as \\"Seifert type\\". Critics appreciated a well-thought composition of paintings, attention to detail, as well as harmonic colors and a pleasant atmosphere. Seifert spent most of his life in Germany. In native Bohemia, he was personally almost unknown, though he had exhibitions in Prague and black- and-white reproductions of his works regularly appeared in Svƒõtozor magazine. Some Czechs criticized his lack of patriotism by pointing out on his preference for foreign topics over domestic ones. His approach, however, was explained by financial reality: to make his living, he had to create such paintings that his Munich audience was willing to buy. In Bohemia, his works did not sell well, even if he accommodated. For example, a history painting Jan Augusta welcomes Filipina WelserJan Augusta was a bishop of Unity of the Brethren; he was arrested in 1548 for his participation in a revolt of Czech Estates against Emperor Ferdinand I and held as a prisoner in K≈ôivokl√°t castle for 16 years.

The first jump from this tower was on June 2, 1935 by Amelia Earhart, who described the experience as \\"Loads of fun!\\". He died of a heart attack in Marathon, Florida on March 4, 1981. Great Adventure Controversy In 1973 Switlik initially agreed to sell 800 acres of property he owned to the original company that eventually became Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey. The controversy was how the property was to be utilized. It was his position that it would be used for a drive through animal park, but the plan of the buyers was also to include an amusement park. As a conservationist, the amusement park should not be built. In a long protracted legal battle which eventually went to the US Supreme Court, Mr. Switlik lost his case. A judgement of $4.8 million dollars had been originally awarded, but the long battle increased the payment substantially due to interest on the original judgement. This resulted in the bankruptcy to him and his family. Great Adventure was built and now includes both amusement rides and a drive through animal park. The drive through animal park has been converted to using buses instead of drivers using their own cars. Legacy The Stanley Switlik Elementary school in Marathon, Florida is named for him,Stanley Switlik Elementary School website as is the Switlik Elementary SchoolSwitlik Elementary School in Jackson, New Jersey. Switlik Residents Hall at Rider University in Lawrenceville, New Jersey is also named after Stanley Switlik. He served on the Board of Trustees of Rider for 16 years and received an honorary degree in 1954.

Location  The ruins are located on a high, rocky spur which today is covered in woods, about 1 km northeast of the village of Neustadt on the southern edge of the Harz mountains.  History  An arch, part of the Hohnstein ruins The ruins of Hohnstein Castle Hohnstein Castle ‚Äì entranceway Honstein Castle was built in the time of the Hohenstaufen-Guelph conflict for the throne. Its foundation is attributed to Konrad von Sangerhausen, a relative of the legendary Thuringian count, Louis the Springer. The Counts of Hohnstein, together with the Counts of Ilefeld who had married into them, inherited the lordship of the South Harz from Konrad. The newly founded dynasty of the Honstein-Ilfeld counts introduced the family Christian name, Elger, and chose Honstein Castle as their family seat; the modest Ilburg in nearby Ilfeld was probably abandoned at this point in time. The first mention of Honstein Castle was in 1202. Like the Thuringian landgraves, the Honstein clan rapidly amassed a considerable amount of territory, which included the regions around Arnstadt and Gotha in the Thuringian Basin. The first boom period for the family during the 13th century was followed by a loss of importance when, in 1315, the estate was divided between several family lines. Honstein Castle soon became militarily outdated. In 1380 it was captured for the first time and then again in 1412 during a family dispute, which degenerated into the so-called Flegler War, during the course of which the Hohnstein counts lost their family castle. During the Peasants' War, Honstein was still seen as a secure fortification and was therefore selected by the abbott of Ilfeld Abbey to protect himself and the abbey treasure. Whilst the Counts of Hohnstein saw out the end of their reign at Lohra Castle (they died out in 1593), Hohnstein Castle was sold into the possession of the Counts of Stolberg, who modernised the fort militarily and structurally at great expense (including an artillery tower) and turned it into a typical Renaissance Schloss. During this period it became one of the largest castles in the Harz. During the Thirty Years War, however, Hohnstein Castle was destroyed by fire. Having been requisitioned in 1627 by an imperial officer, Colonel du Vuer, troops from the Electorate of Saxony under Lieutenant Colonel Vitztum von Eckstedt stormed the castle and drove out the imperial forces. Because Vitztum knew that he could not hold the castle for any length of time he placed the Counts of Stolberg under pressure so that he could extort money from them in return for handing it over. The Stollbergs could not (or would not) meet this ultimatum, so Vitztum had his soldiers set fire to the already heavily plundered castle on Christmas Eve of 1627. According to tradition, Vitztum knew how to foil every attempt by guards on duty to put the fires out. Only a few usable remnants could be recovered from the blackened ruins following the withdrawal of Vitztum's troops; these included the clock from the castle chapel and the altar of the palace chapel. In the course of the following decades and centuries the castle ruins continued to decay. In 1908 an inn was built below the ruins. After 1990 safety and restoration work on the castle ruins was started. In Easter 2001 the castle was once again re-occupied.  Site  The ruins of Hohnstein Castle may be visited without a guide. It has a checkpoint (No. 98) on the Harzer Wandernadel hiking trail network by the cafe just beyond the gateway.

Career James was the eldest son of Sir Edmund MacRichard Butler, whom he succeeded in 1464 as Lord Deputy of Ireland over his absentee cousins John and Thomas, the 6th and 7th Earls of Ormond, respectively. As was his family's tradition, he had a long career as a Gaelic warlord which included raiding and rustling across southern Leinster. He sided with the House of Lancaster against King Edward IV of England for which he was attainted; but when that King was settled on the throne, he overlooked this mistake in his conduct, and an Act of Parliament passed in Ireland, repealed all attainders, judgments, and outlawries, against him. The King, in consideration of his faithful services from that time, granted him, in April 1468 (among other things) the manor and advowson of Callan for life.

He was knighted, and built the castle of Neigham (Nehorn old name) near Gowran. Death He died on 16 April 1487 and was buried in the priory of Augustine eremites at Callan, of which priory he was the founder.

The ship was discovered by a team led by Robert Ballard in 2000. The team discovered the well-preserved wreck at a 320 m depth, in the Black Sea's deep anoxic waters. The vessel's entire hull and cargo are intact, buried in sediments. Its deck structures are also intact, including a mast rising some 11 m into the water column. Radiocarbon dating of wood from the wreck provides a date of 410-520 CE.NOAA Aegean and Black Sea Expedition 2007 Excavations In 2000, Ballard and his team conducted an expedition that focused on the exploration of the sea bed about 15-30 km west of Sinop, and an additional deep-water survey east and north of the peninsula. Their project had several goals. They sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape, they examined the sea-bed for shipwrecks (where they found Sinop A-D), to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200 m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components, and to seek data about an ancient trade route between Sinop and the Crimea indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains. The wreck found provided the team with vast information about both the technological changes and trade that occurred in the Black Sea during a period of political, social and economic transition through their study of the ship‚Äôs construction techniques. Studies show that long-distance trading had developed in Sinop as early as 4500 BCE. Sea-trading on the Black Sea was most intense during the period of late antiquity, between the 2nd and 7th centuries CE.Hiebert, F., 2001, Black Sea coastal cultures: trade and interaction, Expedition 43: 11-20 Sinop D provides direct evidence for Black Sea maritime trade so well attested by the distribution of ceramics on land. Sinop D provided Ballard and his team with an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction during a time of transition. When observing the sonar signature of Sinop D, a long, slender upright feature on the sea-bed transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200 m below the surface. There are currently few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together, as the bulk of the ship remains buried in sediments. There are no mortise and tenon fastenings, and no sewing. Sinop D was originally thought to be one of the earliest lateen-rigged ships available to be studied by archaeologists. However, a 2007 expedition to the site identified what is now believed to be a mast for an artemon, which would suggest a different type of vessel. Some photos are available on line.Deepwater investigations of two Byzantine shipwrecks, 2007 New technology is currently in development that will allow more thorough and preservative excavations to take place.

The palace complex includes the Herzogspark, a municipal park with a Renaissance garden and a medieval tower known as the Prebrunnturm. W√ºrttembergisches Palais is the seat of the Natural History Museum of East Bavaria (). History In 1804, the finance director of the Princely House of Thurn and Taxis, Georg Friedrich Ritter von M√ºller, acquired the site of the present Herzogspark, which at that time marked the outskirts of Regensburg. According to its specifications, it connected to the adjacent estates of the princely house and created a park. In the southern part of the park, master builder Emanuel Herigoyen constructed the present palace for Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg. Construction of the palace was completed in 1806. After M√ºller's death in 1843, Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis's sister Duchess Maria Sophia of W√ºrttemberg acquired the palace and made it her residence following her divorce from Duke Paul Wilhelm of W√ºrttemberg. It is from Maria Sophia that the palace takes its present name, W√ºrttembergisches Palais. The city of Regensburg acquired the palace and its surrounding park in 1932. Regensburg left the property to the Natural History Society of Regensburg () in 1961 because of its extensive collection of gardens. From 1986 to 1991, the palace underwent extensive renovations. Architecture The Renaissance garden in the Herzogspark, adjacent to W√ºrttembergisches Palais. The two-story palace consists of three wings, which are obtusely linked. Also of architectural note are the roundabout oak staircase and the stucco Biedermeier elements excavated during the palace's renovation.Naturkundemuseum Ostbayern: Geschichte, accessed 28 May 2009 From the palace's 60 m¬≤ ballroom, visitors are able to view west into the adjacent park.

It is the primary subsidiary of First Guaranty Bancshares, Inc., a bank holding company. The bank operates 21 branches.  History  The bank was founded in Hammond, Louisiana in 1934 as Guaranty Bank & Trust Company. In 1971, the bank was renamed First Guaranty Bank. In 1999, the bank acquired 13 branches from Bank One. In 2007, the company acquired Homestead Bancorp, Inc. for $13 million in cash. It also acquired Douglass National Bank of Kansas City. On September 22, 2011, the bank exited its participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program by repurchasing securities from the United States Treasury for $21.1 million. In 2017, the company acquired Premier Bancshares for $21 million in cash and stock. In August 2019, the bank's holding company entered into a deal to purchase the holding company of The Union Bank of Marksville, Louisiana for $43 million. When completed late in 2019, the acquisition will increase the bank's number of branches by about 50% to around 30.  Allegation of racial discrimination In 2019, Nikole Hannah-Jones, in a New York Times podcast, asserted that the bank discriminated against two African-American farmers, June and Angie Provost. According to the reporting, the bank is alleged to have engaged in fraud by changing loan amounts and forging the signatures of the applicants. This had the intended effect of putting financial pressure on the Provosts and eventually led them to lose their farm and their home to foreclosure. The case is now the subject of litigation and a federal USDA whistle-blower complaint. The bank denied these allegations, saying that they are \\"completely unfounded and frivolous\\", also stating that it \\"has not and does not engage in discriminatory practices\\".

In 2004, he had a solo exhibition at Lisa Dent Gallery in San Francisco, and in 2007 he was part of the Roswell Artist in Residence Program where he experimented in sustainable living as sculpture.McGarrell biodata Since his youth McGarrell was fascinated with Haiti and Haitian culture and in 2008 he took the position of director of the art center FOSAJ in Jacmel, a city famed for its art located on the southern coast of Haiti. FOSAJ was founded in 2003 by a wealthy local family and its mission is to revive the international market for locally made art, which collapsed due to decades of political instability. McGarrell served as director of the center until his death and during his tenure he develop a relationship with local artists and the community. Fosaj board member Regine Boucard said of McGarrell that, \\"Everybody loved him ‚Äî the artists, the students, the community. And he sort of understood the Haitians.\\" Death On Tuesday, January 12, 2010, a devastating magnitude 7.0 M earthquake centered approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Port-au- Prince, leveled buildings throughout Haiti, including the \\"Peace of Mind\\" Hotel in Jacmel. McGarrell had just dropped off his godfather in Port-au- Prince and had stopped off at the hotel on his way to the FOSAJ center, where he both lived and worked. He was sitting with a visiting friend and fellow artist, Sue Frame, when the earthquake hit. and was killed as the building collapsed on top of him. He was apparently killed instantly. Frame ran out at the first tremor; McGarrell hesitated briefly, perhaps concerned for his laptop computer. Works An early interest in metalsmithing over time, developed into a commitment to installation art with a focus on political concerns and ecology. Most of McGarrell's mature work utilized strongly color- coordinated plastics to create interior/exterior spaces, and living plants to create functioning vegetable gardens, also situated indoors and out. McGarrell's installations were created, as much as feasible, from discarded, recycled materials. His gardens functioned from recycled grey water and included hands-on, instructive material on creating compost at home and the artist's own recipes for meals designed from both a nutritional standpoint and their palatability. This teaching material, as well as most of McGarrell's other writing, was distributed freely, in accordance with the artist's dedication to free copyright, or Creative Commons approach to intellectual property.Flo McGarrell, \\"I (Green Heart) Agrisculpture\\", published handout from the Alliance for the Visual Arts, Lebanon, New Hampshire, Summer, 2009. McGarrell was the art director of the film, Maggots and Men, an experimental retelling of the story of the 1921 uprising of the Kronstadt sailors in post- revolutionary Russia. Transgender identity Assigned to a female gender role at birth, McGarrell identified strongly with androgyny since childhood, and the transgender and queer (or radical queer) community as an adult. He began formally identifying as a male in 2003-04. His transition involved a limited amount of hormone therapy‚Äîbut no surgery‚Äîand was part of an intellectual journey into radical politics which was, in turn, related to the artist's philosophy and output. He described himself as \\"a total gender mash up (beard, miniskirt, etc.)\\" and as a \\"non-passing transperson.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Interview by Georgia Kotretsos, \\"Inside the Artist's Studio: Flo McGarrell\\" * Zagria blogspot.com * McGarrell's CV *Dan Simmons, Chicago artist survives earthquake but friend is killed trying to escape hotel, Chicago Tribune, 17 January, 2010. * Blog.

Background BƒÉhƒÉian became notable in the 1990s when he scammed over 5000 people with bad checks though his company Sabina Product, which is considered one of the biggest financial scandals in Romania during that decade. The damages were over 7 billion lei. In 1995 BƒÉhƒÉian fled to Hungary together with three accomplices, but he was caught, extradited, and sentenced to five years in jail in 1998. He was released in 2002. Afterward, BƒÉhƒÉian was nicknamed \\"the prince of bad checks\\". According to Realitatea TV news portal, in 1998 he defrauded a German business partner of 130,000 marks and 4,000 dollars, but was released soon after his arrest. He was investigated again in 2006 for alleged damages of 30 billion lei (400,000 euros), which were created by establishing the company Absolut Uniprix SRL under a fake identity (Constantin Tudorache) and using it to buy seven cars (four Renault Megane, one Renault Clio and two Volkswagen Polo) and various construction materials. According to the newspaper AdevƒÉrul, in 2009 BƒÉhƒÉian bought the football club Gloria BuzƒÉu through a front company that had 200 lei worth of assets. Although he appeared at a few games, BƒÉhƒÉian avoided being officially identified as the owner of the club. On 16 January 2010, BƒÉhƒÉian was arrested by the Romanian organized- crime police after a car chase through the center of Bucharest. Cornered, BƒÉhƒÉian did not surrender until police opened fire on his car, which had armored windows. One police officer suffered a fractured arm during the arrest. Simultaneously with BƒÉhƒÉian's arrest, four of his collaborators were arrested in Bucharest, Constan≈£a, and Ialomi≈£a, in an operation that involved 60 police officers. BƒÉhƒÉian was charged with ordering the killing of four people in \\"mafioso style\\" between 2006 and 2008, in a case that Romania's chief prosecutor Laura Codru≈£a K√∂vesi declared to be \\"unprecedented\\". According to the prosecution, the victims, all former business associates of BƒÉhƒÉian, were forced to swallow diazepam and alcohol, and were later buried alive or thrown in the Danube ‚Äì Black Sea Canal or the Danube river. Two of the victims were found in the Cerchezu commune, buried at a depth of 2.5 metres under a layer of rocks and concrete. The Department of Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism Offences (DIICOT) suspects that there may be other victims. According to the prosecution, BƒÉhƒÉian recruited lonely and poor people, created front companies in their names, and then asked them to buy various merchandise and cars with bad checks or promissory notes. Over 40 companies were created for this purpose. The balance sheets of these companies were usually cooked. When these accomplices, who normally received less than 0.1% of the profits, started to make demands, they were eliminated by two of BƒÉhƒÉian's lieutenants, Valentin ≈ûlepac and Adrian Grigora≈ü. The monetary damages have been estimated to be at least 800,000 euros by AdevƒÉrul newspaper, or 2 million euros by the G√¢ndul newspaper and Mediafax news agency. At the time of his 2010 arrest, Sergiu BƒÉhƒÉian had 1600 friends on Facebook. In April 2013, the High Court of Cassation and Justice rejected his appeal, upholding the sentence to 26 years in prison for murder, organized crime and fraud. The appeals of his two main accomplices, Valentin Slepac and Adrian Grigoras were not considered because they had already died in jail; they had been sentenced to life and respectively 22 years.\\"Sergiu Bahaian, condamnat definitiv la 26 de ani de inchisoare pentru instigare la comiterea de asasinate in serie\\", hotnews.ro, 3 April 2013 Three more of BƒÉhƒÉian's accomplices, Edward Marian MƒÉrculescu, Dan Liviu Iovan and George Florian Oprea, also saw their sentences upheld to 13 and a half years, 13 years, and respectively 5 years in prison.

Kelly, the first postmaster, was also said to have been the first settler there. In 1915 Riverton had a population of 200. At that time Riverton shipped coal mined locally by steamboat to California. The first coal mine opened in the county in 1854 and up to a quarter of people worked in what was then the region's most important industry. Riverton served as a coal-mining center for more than 50 years. In 1940, Riverton's population was 150, and the place served as a trading center for farmers who grew peas. The post office closed in 1961. Formerly Riverton Ferry crossed the Coquille there and as of 1969, it was still being operated by the county. At one time the community had a high school and a grade school. Circa 1901, there was a Christian Church and today there is a Riverton Community Church unaffiliated with the former one.

She was a person and composer of stature during her life, although less remembered subsequently. Many of her works were published under pseudonyms. Biography Marie F√©licie Cl√©mence de Reiset was the youngest of four children, born in 1828 into a well-to-do family in the Chateau de la Cour du Bois at Saint-R√©my- des-Monts. Her father was an Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur and a talented pianist, while her mother wrote and published stories. Her parents received many composers and artists, including Jean-Baptiste-Phil√©mon de Cuvillon, Auguste-Joseph Franchomme, Louis-Nicolas Cary and Paul Scudo. At a very young age, she received composition lessons from composer and family friend Friedrich Flotow, and later studied with Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. Because her family was wealthy, she was able to work as a composer without financial concerns. She married the Vicomte de Grandval and they had two daughters, Isabelle and Th√©r√®se. She subsequently studied for two years with Camille Saint-Sa√´ns (he dedicated his Oratorio de Noel to her), and continued to work as a composer after her marriage. However, her social position led her to publish several of her works under pseudonyms. These included Caroline Blangy, Cl√©mence Valgrand, Maria Felicita de Reiset and Maria Reiset de Tesier. Grandval was the recipient of the inaugural Prix Rossini, winning in 1881 with her librettist Paul Collin. Her earliest works were sacred and performed in churches, but she went on to write a number of operas and various popular songs and instrumental works, including many pieces for oboe. Unfortunately, the orchestral scores of some of her pieces have been lost. During the 1870s, Grandval played a major role in the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique, and was the most played composer in this society. She also gave much money to the organisation. During the second part of the 19th century, she was a very popular composer who was admired by many critics. She died in Paris in 1907. Notable compositions Unlike many of her contemporaries, Grandval wrote many pieces for oboe, and unlike her female contemporaries, she wrote several operas. Selected works include: Opera * Le sou de Lise (1859) * Les fianc√©s de Rosa (1863) * Piccolino (1869) * Atala (c. 1888) * Mazeppa (1892) Choral * Mass (1867) * Stabat mater (1870), cantata * Sainte-Agn√®s (1876), oratorio * La fille de Ja√Øre (1881), oratorio Concertante * Oboe concerto in D minor, Op. 7 Chamber * 2 pieces for clarinet and piano (1885) * 4 pieces for cor anglais and piano *Deux Pieces, ob, vc, pf, 1884; published by June Emerson: WP references: https://www.juneemersonwindmusic.com/DEUX-PIECES-Romance- Gavotte.html Songs * \\"No√´l!\\" (1901) Awards * 1880: Concour Rossini, for her oratorio La fille de Ja√Øre. * 1890: Cartier Prize, Conservatoire de Paris, for her chamber music.

The son of church composer Franz Anton Schubert (the Elder, 1768‚Äì1824), Schubert was married to the singer and actress Maschinka Schubert (1815‚Äì1882) who was the daughter of horn player and composer Georg Abraham Schneider. Their daughter was the opera singer Georgina Schubert (1840‚Äì1878). Fran√ßois Schubert composed concert pieces, √©tudes, and chamber music, but is largely known for the bagatelle The Bee, a perpetuum mobile for violin and piano ‚Äì a piece that is often misattributed to Franz Schubert due to the similarity of the two men's names.

He is said to be the first to transport Canadian whiskey to Los Angeles. Marco worked closely with Charles H. Crawford, who ran city politics along with Kent Kane Parrot. Biography Marco was born in 1887 in Italy. Marco came to the United States through Ellis Island in 1908. He started off as a pimp and con man in Nevada and Washington. In 1919 he served a brief prison sentence for burglary in Sacramento. Crawford, an old friend from their days in Seattle convinced Marco to move to Los Angeles. In the early 1920s Marco drove to L.A. in a Cadillac transporting alcohol to a Long Beach warehouse. The political connections created by Crawford's political machine let Marco operate without much fear of prosecution for his crimes. In 1925 Marco pistol whipped an LAPD officer and was given a $50 fine and his gun back. According to the IRS, between 1922 and 1924 Marco earned $500,000 from bordello prostitution. On June 28, 1928 Marco was arrested and put on trial for assault with a deadly weapon when he shot Dominick Conterno and Harry Judson. He was found guilty on two counts and was sentenced to two seven-year terms by judge William C. Doran. On April 1, 1929 Marco was sent to San Quentin State Prison to serve his sentence. Marco appealed the ruling, but was denied a second trial. He was paroled on April 7, 1933.

In 1994 they changed their name, first to Fragment and then to Rail. The initial line-up was Ashley Naylor on guitar and vocals, David Sayer on bass guitar, Dan Vertessy on vocals and guitar, and Ian Williams on drums. They released two albums, Bad Hair Life (September 1995) and Goodbye Surfing Hello God! (May 1997). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1996 they were nominated for Best New Talent for Bad Hair Life, while its lead single, \\"Immune Deficiency\\", was nominated for Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single. The group disbanded in late 1998. Ian Gregory Williams died, by drowning, in mid-1999, aged 28.  History  Rail were an Australian indie guitar pop group from Melbourne, during the 1990s.Rail on Last.fm They were formed in 1993 by Ashley Naylor on lead guitar and vocals (ex-Swarm, from 1994 he was contemporaneously a member of Even), David Sayer on bass guitar and backing vocals, Danny Richard Vertessy on lead vocals and guitar, and Ian Williams on drums and backing vocals. Vertessy and Williams had played together in the Wick Effect from 1990 to 1992.As seen in this performance video Williams was also a member of Melbourne Indie guitar band Raw Nerves ~91-93. Rail were originally named Sleeper and released a six-track, self-titled extended play (EP) in March 1994. Triple J picked up the track, \\"Spinning Ball\\", from Sleeper, and the track was later included on their debut album. They changed their name to Fragment to avoid confusion with a United Kingdom band (see Sleeper). As Fragment they recorded a track, \\"Careering\\", for rooArt's Youngblood 4 (1994) compilation before settling on the name Rail. They signed to Mushroom Records' imprint, White Label, in that year. Their debut album, Bad Hair Life appeared in September 1994 and was critically acclaimed. Barry Divola of Who Weekly (November 1995) declared, \\"Vertessy has a delicious drawl of a voice... Rail are world weary without being total boring losers. The refrain of 'Immune Deficiency' is an irresistible sing-along rather than a dirge, while 'Rock Dreams' is a scrawled tale of faded flannelette reading about rock stars.\\" Rolling Stones yearbook for 1995 includes, \\"another triumph for the kind of pop songwriting which doesn't rely on overdrive to make it's point. These guys used their imaginations first, volume knobs second, and came up with one of the more interesting production jobs of the year as a result.\\" The album's lead single, \\"Immune Deficiency\\", was released in August 1995, which received high rotation on radio and TV on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), especially on national youth radio, Triple J. The lyrics, by Vertessy, Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' are written from the point of view of a person with HIV/AIDS. It was listed at No. 72 in Triple J Hottest 100, 1995. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1996 they were nominated for Best New Talent for Bad Hair Life, while \\"Immune Deficiency\\" was nominated for Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single. Rail performed at the South by South West Conference & Festival in Austin, Texas in 1996. The second album,Goodbye Surfing, Hello God (May 1997), named after a Brian Wilson reference, was recorded in mid-1996 at Sing Sing Studios, Melbourne with New York producer Don Fleming (Teenage Fanclub, the Posies, Sonic Youth). Fleming described how, \\"Producing is psychology. Every band is different, there's different personalities. There's trouble makers, fuck ups, analytical ones... you have to dig your way through.\\" The album was influenced by Neil Young, Alex Chilton, Big Star, the Posies, Swervedriver, Teenage Fanclub: all of whom Rail had supported. Simon Woolridge of Juice felt, \\"[this] is comparatively live and off the cuff as opposed to Bad Hair Lifes painstaking genesis. And it's lyrics are written from a fictional perspective, Vertessy now having experienced the responsibilities of song writing which involved fans expecting him to play the part of the protagonist in his songs.\\" Rolling Stones Tracey Grimson discussed how the album, \\"courses the spectrum of moods, through melancholy lamentations on love to the forthright embrace of power, drive and strength. It's there in the songs, from the classic rollicking rock of 'Sun Shiny Day' to the gentle balladry of 'Hey Little Beauty Queen'. 'My Art' takes a ride through country; the single 'I Am Awake' is honest heart-on-sleeve sweetness with a soaring chorus\\". It was Naylor's final recording session with the band as he had left by October 1996 to concentrate on his main band, Even. Most of the group's work was written by Vertessy. Dan O'Halloran (ex-Saidaside) replaced Naylor on guitar in 1997. O'Halloran left the band in mid-1998 and they performed as trio with occasional inclusion of keyboardist, Craig Sayer. Rail performed at The Big Day Out, Melbourne and at The Falls Festival. TV performances include Channel 31 Melbourne, ABC TV's Recovery (as the featured band) and programming of an episode of Rage in 1996. The group split up in late 1998.

It was formed in 1988 as part of Temple-Inland and in 2007 became a standalone company. At the time of its collapse, Guaranty was the second largest bank in Texas, with 162 branches across Texas and California, and had $13 billion in assets and held $12 billion in deposits. Major shareholders included billionaire investor Carl Icahn and hotel tycoon Robert Rowling, who jointly invested $600 million in the bank in 2008. History Guaranty Bank's origins date to 1938, when a charter was issued to the Guaranty Building and Loan in Galveston, Texas which operated as the Guaranty Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1988, Temple-Inland formed Guaranty by acquiring three financial institutions: Guaranty Federal Savings and Loan Association, Delta Savings Association and First Federal Savings and Loan. It expanded from Texas into California in the 1990s, acquiring Stockton Savings Bank and Hemet Federal Savings & Loan.Temple-Inland to Buy California Financial Financial Services In November 2007, Temple-Inland announced that it planned to separate itself into three stand-alone public companies. Shareholders in the original company would eventually receive stock in all three companies depending on the amount owned on the day the company split-up. The three companies were: *Temple-Inland Inc. *Guaranty Financial Group Inc. *Forestar Real Estate Group Inc. Guaranty Financial Group Inc. became a standalone financial services holding company that operated in various business segments through its primary operating subsidiaries, \\"Guaranty Bank\\" and \\"Guaranty Insurance Services, Inc.\\" Guaranty Bank became a federally chartered savings bank with total assets in excess of $16 billion (consolidated) that conducted consumer and business banking activities through a network of approximately 150 bank branches located in Texas and California that provided commercial banking products and services to various geographic markets throughout the United States. Guaranty Insurance Services, Inc. became an insurance agency that focused on property and casualty insurance with fixed annuities and operated out of 17 offices located in Texas and California, as well as through branches of Guaranty Bank. Also in November In November 2008, Kenneth R. Dubuque resigned as president and chief executive officer of the company and the bank, positions he had served in beginning in 1998 and continuing through November 18, 2008. John T. Stuart III, a director of the company and the bank, was appointed as interim chief executive officer and interim chairman of the board of the company. Also in November 2008, the company appointed Kevin J. Hanigan, previously a senior executive vice president and chief banking officer of the company and the bank, to fill the role of president and chief operating officer of the company and the bank.  Collapse  As a thrift bank, its charter required it to keep 70% of its assets in housing-related investments, leaving it exposed to the 2007 US housing crash In April 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the bank to take a $1.5 billion writedown on the value of the mortgage-backed securities it held. This in turn left the bank with an inadequate Tier 1 capital ratio, with the bank issuing a statement saying that it was likely to be too undercapitalized to continue as a going concern. The bank's share price collapsed from $18.50 to less than 15 cents. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assumed control of the failed bank August 21, 2009. This was the 10th largest bank failure in US history, and the second largest of the 140 bank collapses of 2009 (behind Colonial Bank). The FDIC immediately sold the assets of the bank to BBVA Compass, the US-based subsidiary of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), the second biggest bank in Spain. This was the first deal between the FDIC and an institution bank tied to a foreign bank for almost 20 years. Under the agreement, the FDIC and BBVA Compass shared the losses of the bank, with the costs to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund estimated to be $3 billion. Guaranty Bank was absorbed into its new parent company, with its branches being rebranded as BBVA Compass outlets. See also *Temple-Inland *BBVA Compass Further reading *Markham, Jerry W.

The market occupies a town centre site between Southgate, Albion Street and Market Street. The glass and wrought iron covered marketplace, surrounded by stone built shops and accommodation, was built between 1891 and 1896 and opened by the future King George V and Queen Mary. The design included three public houses on the Market Street side and fishmongers' shops on Albion Street with the remaining exterior shops all being butchers' shops. The award-winning market is open six days a week with some 125 market stalls. History An original floor plan of the market The site had previously been occupied by a red brick Georgian market place built in 1790. A nearby slaughterhouse had ended the practice of slaughtering animals in the street. Trade had been concentrated here since 1810 when an Act of Parliament had been obtained which forbade street trading in other parts of the town.* Another Act of Parliament in 1853 allowed Halifax council to buy New Market, as it was known, from its private owners for a price of ¬£7,700.100 years of Halifax Borough Market, p. 5 The Markets and Fairs Committee decided in 1890 to replace the overflowing market place with a new structure. Local architects Joseph and John Leeming were engaged to draw up plans. A ¬£50,000 loan was obtained by the Corporation the following year, with the final cost rising to ¬£130,000, which was ¬£20,000 over budget.100 years of Halifax Borough Market, p. 18 Work began in October 1892 and progressed slowly, until the market was officially opened on 25 July 1896 by the Duke and Duchess of York, who later became King George V and Queen Mary. They also opened the Royal Halifax Infirmary on the same day. Opening hours at the outset were 8 am to 8 pm on Mondays to Wednesdays, with half day closing on Thursdays, 8 am to 4 pm. Fridays were 8 am to 9 pm and Saturdays 6 am to 10.30 pm. The building's stonework was cleaned in 1973, the same year that Southgate was made into a pedestrian area, with the road raised to pavement level.100 years of Halifax Borough Market, p. 46 In 1987 the Civic Trust gave the market an award for its renovated Victorian shop fronts, commenting that the market has \\"an elegance seldom seen on such a grand scale\\".100 years of Halifax Borough Market, p. 37 In 1993 the central clock, often used as a rendezvous point, was refurbished using more than fifty square feet of gold leaf.100 years of Halifax Borough Market, p. 40 In 1995 the Halifax Centre Strategy Report recommended moving the fishmongers on Albion Street inside the market and replacing them with shop units to improve attractiveness and rental income.Halifax Centre Strategy Report, 3.7.3 Construction The clock under the octagonal lantern A 5,850 m¬≤ (7,000 square yard) canopy of glass and wrought iron covers the space between ornate four storey stone buildings, topped by baroque turrets, on Southgate and Market Street, and single storey stone shops on the other sides. The multi-storey buildings contain living quarters, originally for market traders and managers. Water was originally drawn from a well near the Market Street entrance. There were originally forty three outward facing shops, all butcher's, in the stone buildings, with the exception of Albion Street where there was a fish market, and three public houses on Market Street. The pubs were the Wheatsheaf, later renamed the Portman and Pickles, the Saddle and the Peacock. The Portman and Pickles was named after Eric Portman and Wilfred Pickles. At the centre of the market an 18-metre (60 ft) high octagonal lantern is supported by decorative cast iron columns. Below the lantern a decorative clock was originally visible from most parts of the market, although now obscured by taller stalls. Cruciform main passages are mirrored in the structure of the roof, with solid roofing above the passages creating four glass roofed quarters, each divided into three sections, glazed with rectangular panes. Flagstones used for flooring in the market, still in good condition, came from Solomon Marshall's quarry at Southowram, a business which has since grown into Marshalls plc.100 years of Halifax Borough Market, p. 25 The slope of the site is accommodated without the use of steps.100 years of Halifax Borough Market, p. 54 In modern times The market operates six days a week with about 125 stalls and won the title of best market by the National Association of British Market Authorities in 2008.

He was a Tudor rebel and scion of the noble House of Ormond. Life and career In 1562, was in commission for presentation of the peace in County Carlow, during the Deputy's absence in the North against Shane O'Neill. He was knighted in 1567 and had a grant for the return of all Writs in the cantreds (baronies) of Oremond (Ormond Lower and Ormond Upper), Elyogerth (Eliogarty), and Elyocarrol (Ikerrin) in Tipperary.Lodge, John: pg 42. Battle of Affane During the Battle of Affane in 1565, Edmund wounded Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond in the right hip with a pistol-shot, cracking his thigh-bone and throwing him from his mount. With their leader fallen, the Geraldine troops were routed and the Butlers, led by Edmund's brother Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, pursued them to the riverbank killing about 300 Geraldines. Butler Revolt His father died in London in 1546 when Edmund was about 12 years of age. By his father's will, he received the Dullough - the western part of the barony of Idrone, which, with the Roscrea property, was considered to be worth ¬£400 yearly.Hughes, James; The Journal of the Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland, Fourth Series, Vol. 1, No. 1 (1870), pp. 153-192, 211-231. The 9th Earl had purchased the Dullogh from the Kavanaghs who had been in occupation of the land since before the Norman invasion of Ireland. Sir Peter Carew put forward his claims in right of his ancestors, the lords of Idrone. It was in defence of this property that Sir Edmund came into conflict with the Government. Edmund, then heir to his brother, earned infamy when he led the Butler Revolt in 1569. Alongside his brothers Edward and Pierce, Edmund's rebellion was in direct response to the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney who unjustly granted Edmund's lands in Idrone to the English adventurer Sir Peter Carew. Edmund and his brothers responded by raiding English settlements up and down the breadth of Leinster and were declared traitors by Sidney. This was all the more remarkable because the Butlers had long been famed for their incredible loyalty to the Crown of England. Eventually Edmund's brother, the Earl of Ormond, fearing for the future of his lands and titles, responded by joining his erstwhile enemy Sidney and marched against Edmund. Under pressure from Earl Thomas, he was attainted by Queen Elizabeth I. But on surrendering his estate to the Queen, 10 October 1570, he was pardoned, (together with his brothers Edward and Piers) dated at Gorhambury 12 March 1573, of all their treasons. While she agreed to save his life, Elizabeth did not remove the attainder on Edmund. His brothers Edward and Piers Butler remained with the Desmond forces. Nevertheless, the indefatigable Edmund, with the help of Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne, escaped from Dublin Castle where he was imprisoned. He rather ungallantly fell from a rope hung from the battlements and was forced to spend the night roaming around in the castle fosse evading Sidney's troops. Following his escape from Dublin, Edmund regained control of Cloughrenan once more, however, his holdings were in a ruinous state and he never lived there again. He remained at large until his death at Inistioge between 1580 and 1590. He is buried at St Canice's Cathedral in Kilkenny city. Heirs and Legacy Some years after Edmund's death, Queen Elizabeth I reversed the attainder on his eldest son Piers, who was granted ancestral lands in Roscrea, County Tipperary. Both Piers and his brother James were executed at Thurles by their uncle Earl Thomas during another rebellion in 1596. In 1602, Elizabeth also reversed the attainder on his last remaining legitimate son Theobald, who became the 1st Viscount of Tulleophelim and Governor of County Carlow. He was also survived by an illegitimate son Thomas who was made a Baronet of Cloughrenan by King Charles I in 1628. The Butlers remained in possession of Cloughrenan until 1715, when James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde was attainted and the lands were granted to the Rochfort family. Marriage and issue He married Eleanor Eustace the second daughter of Rowland Eustace, 2nd Viscount Baltinglass, sister to James (who was in rebellion against Queen Elizabeth, and died without issue). Their children were: * Piers Butler (d.1596), who married Mary Butler, with issue. * James Butler (d.1596) * Theobald Butler (c. 1570-1613), created Viscount Butler of Tulleophelim in 1603.

Although he sculpts in many different countries, most of his major works have been made in the United States, England, and Bolivia. Introduction With important commissions in the United States, South America and Europe, Bolivian born sculptor Pablo Eduardo remains largely unknown to the general public and the art world establishment. Despite a large body of work in the hands of major public institutions and private collectors, Eduardo has been a well-kept secret for most of his professional life. His work is rooted in the figurative tradition of Renaissance and Baroque sculpture and the work of Michelangelo, Leonardo and Bernini specifically. Thus his output reflects a strong interest in representational work of the highest order. Biographical and educational background Pablo Eduardo, born in La Paz, Bolivia in 1969, lives and works in Gloucester, Massachusetts. His interest in art as a young child is tied to early pottery classes he attended with his mother. As a young adult, Eduardo left Bolivia behind and embarked on a course of study and training. After travels in Europe and a year at the Studio Arts Center International in Florence, Italy from 1989 to 1990, he attended The School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MA), and graduated from Tufts University, where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1994. From 1990 to 1992, he completed Anatomical Studies at Tufts University Medical School in Boston where he focused on the dissection of the human body. This concentration provides a direct link to Michelangelo and Leonardo and the humanistic development of an art based on a clear physical understanding of bone, muscle and sinew. Context Much of what Eduardo brings to his work can be traced to his birth and upbringing in Bolivia and the traditions of twentieth century Latin American art, including an affinity for hyperrealism and the intense emotionalism to which surrealism often subscribes. Pablo partakes of the New World's hybrid culture and the strong influence ‚Äì aesthetic and intellectual ‚Äì of European Enlightenment ideals, which helped forge the independent countries of the Americas in the nineteenth century. His generation is perhaps the last to include individuals who experienced the power of this link in Latin America. Indeed, many of his peers had already shifted their attention away from Paris and Rome to the world of the New York art scene on the one hand and to the autochthonous cultures of Latin America on the other. Of his art and place in history Eduardo says the following: \\"For me sculpture conveys a force and poetry that echoes a sense of permanence. My work has its grounding in both classical technique and representation. I cannot, however, ignore my times or the culture that I come from, and so my work is a marriage in progress of all that is me. More importantly, however, is the fact my work has the freedom to go where it wants without hindrance. The only guiding imperative is to work honestly towards the kind of quality in sculpture that springs from the dedicated application of standards revealed through the work itself and its progressive development.\\" Work Eduardo's oeuvre comprises a broad range of sculptural work including related drawings and maquettes. His finished commissions are primarily cast bronze or carved stone. There are bas-reliefs and portrait busts, monumental figurative sculptural works in private and public settings including corporate collections, educational institutions, religious settings and public spaces. The figures he is asked to portray ‚Äì e.g. Charles Darwin, St. Ignatius of Loyola, Cesar Chavez ‚Äì are historically transformational. As a public artist, his projects are often collaborative and provide the opportunity to partner with architects and landscape architects. A good example is the Mayor Kevin White Tribute in Boston, Massachusetts, where he worked closely with the well- established firm of Halvorson Design Partnership to design the space that surrounds the monumental nine-foot bronze figure of Mayor White. His contributions to civic spaces in New England are significant as are those in South America. With the technical skill that allows him to imbue clay and bronze with the breath of life, Eduardo allows the viewer to imagine a place for tradition within the revolution that is always a part of contemporary art in the western world. A major example of his work is the monumental 10-foot bronze figure of St. Ignatius of Loyola located on the campus of Boston College. The figure is earthbound, but clearly caught in an ascending vortex of movement, which transcends its material. Pablo Eduardo expresses the living spirit through the traditional materials employed by sculptors through the ages ‚Äì clay, stone and bronze. This approach forges a link to sculptural goals dominant through the nineteenth century, which were displaced and marginalized throughout the twentieth century. Eduardo is acutely aware of this fact as it relates to his time and place in the history of art. This, however, is balanced by the knowledge there continues to be a yearning for art based on the human form and a growing recognition by scholars and others in the public art field that figurative work is part of the legitimate vocabulary available to the contemporary artist.

Its members are commonly called the 'symmetrical hermit crabs'. They live in all the world's oceans, except the Arctic and the Antarctic, at depths of . Due to their cryptic nature and relative scarcity, only around 60 specimens had been collected before 1987, when a monograph was published detailing a further 400. Description Unlike other hermit crabs, pylochelid hermit crabs are not markedly asymmetrical, with a straight body and equal numbers of appendages on both sides. This characteristic, together with the partial calcification of the abdomen (which is soft in other hermit crabs) led Edward J. Miers, when describing the first species, to consider it to represent a transition between hermit crabs and \\"Macrura\\" (long-tailed decapods, such as lobsters and shrimp). Correspondingly, pylochelid hermit crabs do not usually inhabit gastropod shells, but instead withdraw into decayed pieces of wood, stones, tusk shells (especially Dentaliidae), living sponges, pieces of bamboo or mangroves. Their claws are often adapted to form an operculum, which closes off the entrance to their home. Distribution Although the family as a whole has a global distribution, diversity is concentrated in the Indo-Pacific, with only four species being found in the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea (Cheiroplatea scutata, Pylocheles agassizii, Bathycheles cubensis and Mixtopagurus paradoxus). Pylochelid hermit crabs inhabit a great range in water depths, from , with most living between deep.
